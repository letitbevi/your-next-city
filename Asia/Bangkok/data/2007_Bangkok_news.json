Six near-simultaneous bombs at various points across the capital in the early evening were followed by three explosions shortly before midnight at Central World Plaza, a chic shopping mall with designer stores popular with expatriates. The location was close to where the main countdown celebration for New Year had been due to take place before officials called it off. The injured Britons were named as Alistair Graham, 47, and Paul Hewitt, 55. Mr Hewitt told the Guardian he had been hailing a taxi when an explosion ripped across the street. &quot;There was a huge flash and then I saw blood pouring out of my arm,&quot; he said. &quot;Funnily enough I didn&apos;t feel anything.&quot; Neither was seriously hurt. The other injured foreigners were a Hungarian, an American and two Serbs. Such episodes are a rarity in Bangkok, though the blasts came at the end of a year of unrest in Thailand, including a military coup that ousted the prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, three months ago and an increasingly violent Muslim insurgency in the south of the country. Nobody claimed responsibility for the blasts, which sparked a big security clampdown across the city after the first bombings. At least five of the first six bombs were detonated by timers within a 15-minute period in areas of the city not normally frequented by foreigners. The bombs, some stuffed with nails, wounded about 20 people seriously while the rest returned home after treatment at hospitals, said the health minister, Mongkol Na Songkhla. The final three bombs, left in bags at the side of the road, went off close to midnight in a more touristy part of the city. A 10th device was found unexploded in a hotel toilet. An eyewitness, Klaudiya Tus, 32, from Croatia, said: &quot;We were sitting in a restaurant, we heard a bang and we thought it was fireworks because it was just about midnight. But then a lady came running and said &apos;It&apos;s a bomb, it&apos;s a bomb, it&apos;s a bomb, run&apos;. So we fled. It was very scary, everyone was jumping on top of each other, then we saw people with blood on their faces running out.&quot; An investigation was launched, but the national deputy police chief, General Ajirawit Suphanaphesat, said separatist insurgents were probably not behind the attacks. Apirak Kosayothin, Bangkok&apos;s mayor, expressed shock at the extent of the attacks and cancelled the city&apos;s two big public New Year&apos;s Eve countdown celebrations and other smaller ones. A receptionist at the Saxophone bar near the Victory Monument, another target of the bombings said: &quot;I heard a loud explosion and I thought it was fireworks. I ran there and saw a bleeding woman at the bus stop,&quot; said Somrak Manphothong. Police cordoned off bus stops in the area. At a vegetable market in the Klong Toey slum, where another bomb had exploded, a pool of blood and egg yolks covered the roadside next to an overturned motorcycle. Hotels stepped up security, searching cars on their premises, and some cancelled their expensive New Year&apos;s Eve dinners. A big public celebration was also called off in the northern city of Chiang Mai. &quot;It is not worth risking,&quot; said Major General Bandop Sukhonthaman, the provincial police chief. Police and soldiers with assault rifles guarded some entertainment venues, subway and light railway stations and busy roundabouts. Roadblocks were erected on some streets. The nationals of several embassies were advised through websites to avoid Bangkok&apos;s city centre, with the British embassy urging Britons &quot;not to travel into the city until further notice&quot;. But one Briton, Keith Waters, said: &quot;No, I&apos;m not scared. I&apos;m from England. There are bomb scares all the time.&quot; He nevertheless expressed disappointment since he had been looking forward to ringing in his first new year with his Thai wife. Bangkok has been largely insulated from the violence in southern Thailand that has claimed 1,200 lives in the past three years. But several small explosives were set off during recent political turmoil in an apparent attempt to create a sense of instability, not to cause casualties. Mr Thaksin still has widespread support, and a number of arson attacks in provincial areas have been blamed on his followers. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University, said: &quot;There are two suspects: Muslim insurgents and Thaksin&apos;s residual power. I tend to think it&apos;s residual power. I suspect the previous regime. The coup was not done right. If there had to be a coup, they had to put away Thaksin and his cronies.&quot; Eyewitness &apos;I feel very anxious and apprehensive&apos; Paul Hewitt, 55, a retired airline  employee from West Sussex, was one of two Britons injured in the bombings. He told the Guardian how the last few minutes of 2006 were the most eventful of his year &quot;I was at a party at the Amari Watergate hotel and had left and was trying to hail a taxi when almost exactly as the clock struck new year there was an explosion on the other side of the road. &quot;It all happened so suddenly; there was a huge flash and then I saw blood pouring out of my arm. Funnily enough, I didn&apos;t feel anything. The police told me the bomb may have been in a telephone kiosk or a car, but they are not sure. The hospital are looking after me well. They have found a piece of shrapnel in my left arm. &quot;I arrived here in November, a few months after retiring. I came here to enjoy life and on January 3 I was going to go to Krabi and then later Australia, but I&apos;m not sure now. &quot;I feel very anxious and apprehensive. I&apos;m not sure what&apos;s going on in Bangkok.

At least six explosions. Still two dead. The BBC&apos;s on the case and says nobody thinks it was Muslims. (Clearly they haven&apos;t spoken to E.) It might be opponents of the coup.

After the Thai capital&apos;s worst night of bombing for decades, embassies, including those of Britain, the US and Australia, warned that there could be more explosions and advised holidaymakers to avoid travelling within Bangkok, a city usually known for its relaxed lifestyle and uproarious nightlife. The eight small blasts claimed three lives and left 38 people injured, including two Britons hit by shrapnel at midnight near the Central World Plaza, the main spot for the New Year&apos;s Eve celebrations. The deputy national police chief, General Achiravit Supanpasat, told a press conference yesterday that it was the worst attack in Bangkok in his 40-year career. Faced by a security crisis and a threat to the nation&apos;s vital tourist industry, the government held an emergency meeting and temporarily brought troops back on to the streets for the first time since the coup in September. Many New Year festivities were cancelled, and security was beefed up at the capital&apos;s airport. Police said they had set up 6,000 checkpoints around Bangkok. It was a grim start to 2007 following a year of unrest, during which there was a bloodless military coup against the prime minister of the time, Thaksin Shinawatra, and an increasingly violent Muslim insurgency in the south. There was no warning of the attacks and nobody claimed responsibility, but the prime minister, Surayud Chulanont, pointed the finger at Mr Thaksin and his supporters. &quot;There is a slim chance that it is related to the southern insurgency. It is likely related to people who lost their political benefits,&quot; he told a press conference. &quot;The people who carried out the bombings were ill-intentioned people who want [the attacks] to have political impact. They want to create a scenario of a politically unstable Thailand.&quot; An unnamed senior military source told Associated Press that several senior army officers loyal to Mr Thaksin had plotted the bombing with ousted politicians to discredit the government. According to local media, the top aide to the former prime minister, Prommin Lertsuridej, was ordered to report to the Council for National Security. However, Noppadon Pattama, Mr Thaksin&apos;s lawyer, accused the government of a smear campaign. Since taking control, the new administration has imposed martial law in several strongholds of the former prime minister and launched corruption investigations against Mr Thaksin and his supporters. Mr Thaksin, who is said to be plotting a return from exile in China, remains popular in the countryside, where his Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) party built up enough support to win two elections. Any further escalation of violence would be a disaster for Thailand&apos;s tourist industry, which is only just recovering from the tsunami of two years ago. Every year, an estimated 12 million foreigners, including 750,000 Britons, pass through Bangkok on the way to the beaches of Phuket, Krabi and Ko Samui. With tourism accounting for 6% of the country&apos;s economic activity, the prime minister, who has promised elections this year, played down the risks of more attacks. The New Year&apos;s Eve devices were packed with ammonium nitrate and nails, and left among roadside bins. They were detonated by digital watches. The first six were placed in markets, police booths and at a national monument. Two later bombs went off in the Central World Plaza, a glitzy shopping area where crowds had gathered to celebrate; nine of the victims here were overseas visitors who had either misunderstood or ignored vague warnings to go home early. The attacks are the most alarming sign yet of unrest in a country until recently seen as a relative haven of stability in south-east Asia. But since January 2004 Islamic insurgency has led to the death of more than 1,900 people. In the southern provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani there are almost daily reports of violence. Yesterday police in the north, in Chang Mai, reported a bomb explosion at a mosque. There were no casualties. The suspects Supporters of ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra The Thai government blames the bombs on politicians who lost out in last September&apos;s military coup. The Thaksin camp says the accusations are part of a smear campaign. Muslim insurgents Bombings and shootings occur almost daily in the three southernmost provinces, which have a majority Muslim population. But they have not reached Bangkok before. Police say the new year attacks do not fit the modus operandi of the insurgents. Foreign terrorists Groups linked to al-Qaida have attacked tourist resorts in south-east Asia before, notably in the 2002 and 2005 Bali bombings. The high-profile timing of the attacks led some to draw comparisons, but the explosions appear to be too small and the bombing techniques too unsophisticated. Police say they are not looking for foreign suspects. Crime or conspiracy Criminal gangs involved in narcotics and prostitution could probably launch a bomb attack, but there appears to be little motive now that Thaksin, who launched a crackdown on drug dealing, is out of power. Some locals speculate the military government may have staged the attacks to discredit Thaksin and his party before elections, promised in October.", "publicationDate": "2007-01-02T12:01:05Z", "tags": ["World news", "Travel", "Thailand holidays", "Bangkok holidays", "Thailand", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/02/travelnews.thailand", "title": "Thai leader blames bomb blasts on deposed PM", "sentences": ["Thailand&apos;s military-installed government yesterday blamed politicians who had lost out in last year&apos;s coup for the deadly bomb attacks that ripped through Bangkok on New Year&apos;s Eve.", "After the Thai capital&apos;s worst night of bombing for decades, embassies, including those of Britain, the US and Australia, warned that there could be more explosions and advised holidaymakers to avoid travelling within Bangkok, a city usually known for its relaxed lifestyle and uproarious nightlife.", "The deputy national police chief, General Achiravit Supanpasat, told a press conference yesterday that it was the worst attack in Bangkok in his 40-year career.", "Police said they had set up 6,000 checkpoints around Bangkok.", "Every year, an estimated 12 million foreigners, including 750,000 Britons, pass through Bangkok on the way to the beaches of Phuket, Krabi and Ko Samui.", "But they have not reached Bangkok before."]}, {"article": "&quot;I didn&apos;t mean to,&quot; is rarely a good excuse. It is especially useless when you have just killed two people with a bomb. Eta, the Basque separatist group whose 40-year campaign of terrorism had looked to be coming to an end, is expected to claim it did not mean to kill 19-year-old Diego Estacio and 35-year-old Carlos Palate in a bomb blast at Madrid airport on December 30. It may even try to blame police for failing to clear the airport car parks entirely after several telephone warnings that a bomb was set to explode. Estacio and Palate, two Ecuadorian immigrants who had fallen asleep in their cars while waiting for relatives, join an already long list of Eta&apos;s supposedly &quot;accidental&quot; victims. Their quest for a better life in Europe was cut short by a kind of terrorism that has all but disappeared from the rest of the continent. Rescue workers are still hunting for their corpses in the mess of concrete rubble, twisted girders and flattened cars left behind by 200kg of explosives. The dreams of Basques and Spaniards who thought separatist violence was a thing of the past have also been blown away. &quot;Eta are the ones who have broken off, liquidated, finished the peace process,&quot; responded the Spanish interior minister, Alfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba, after the blasts. Eta&apos;s airport attack was probably an attempt to pile pressure on the prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero&apos;s Socialist government as the group tried to improve its bargaining position at peace talks that were meant to come soon. A destroyed airport car park, without any bodies buried in the rubble, would have served as a moderate show of force - even though Eta was supposed to be observing a ceasefire called on March 22. The IRA&apos;s 1996 Dockland bombing, in the middle of the Northern Irish peace process, may have been the group&apos;s inspiration. But this is not Northern Ireland. Britain&apos;s major parties - Labour and Conservative - worked together in Ireland. In Spain, Mr Zapatero has had to go it alone in the face of angry condemnation from the conservative opposition People&apos;s party. His room for manoeuvre has been seriously limited all along. The killing of two innocent people now presents, if Mr Rubalcaba&apos;s words are anything to go by, an insuperable obstacle. Nor, indeed, does Eta have anything like the strength of the IRA. In the 34 months previous to the ceasefire it had, despite its efforts, failed to kill anyone at all. It is a far cry from the group that killed dozens of people every year in the 1980s and early 1990s. The EU and US list Eta as a terrorist group. Internationally, it is viewed as an anachronistic irrelevance. As a news story, British newspapers placed the Madrid bomb below a series of explosions in far-off Bangkok. Some newspaper readers outside Spain may have been surprised to discover, in fact, that Eta still exists. After years in which police have landed blow after blow against the group, with senior members regularly caught and jailed, Eta also appears to lack strong leadership. That may be a crucial failing at a time when the group is debating major change. All this makes Eta a weak negotiator. Is there anything left for it to talk about beyond the future of several hundred prisoners now in Spanish jails and a lifting of the ban on its sister political party, Batasuna? Not much, according to the government. So what happens next? Will Eta go back to the tired old formula of car bombs and assassinations that has failed to push the Basque country any closer to independence over the past quarter century? Or will it hunker down quietly, hoping that Mr Zapatero gives it a second chance - perhaps after a general election in 2008? Eta&apos;s latest bomb, apart from killing two men, may also prove to have gone off in the group&apos;s hands. For Eta seems to have blown a chance of finding what, by its own terms, could have been a semi-dignified exit from violence. If past experience is anything to go by, it will be still weaker by the time it gets another opportunity. In the meantime, no one will suffer from a failed peace process quite as much as the Basques themselves.", "publicationDate": "2007-01-03T18:45:24Z", "tags": ["Spain", "World news", "Eta", "Europe"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jan/03/etasendgame", "title": "Eta's endgame", "sentences": ["As a news story, British newspapers placed the Madrid bomb below a series of explosions in far-off Bangkok."]}, {"article": "The internet served up the biggest winners among US brands last year, while George Bush&apos;s travails in Iraq sent anything connected with foreign travel or violence spiralling out of fashion.

And my favourite haunt is the glorious giant lump of red rock which is the Brandberg. Though bypassed by most guidebooks, it&apos;s magnificent.

Children over the age of two can sometimes be helped to fall asleep by taking an anti-histamine - such as Phenergan or Vallergan. Discuss it with your doctor, but be warned: when it works well, it works like a dream; but some children can become hyperactive, making a difficult situation potentially very much worse.

Eddie Gibson from Hove, East Sussex, was 19 when he went missing more than two years ago after dropping out of university. He turned up in Cambodia weeks later, but has not been seen since. His parents made an appeal to &quot;the people of Cambodia&quot; on a national television broadcast, asking for clues on the whereabouts or last movements of their son. &quot;Eddie is a loving and caring son,&quot; said his father Mike Gibson, a financier. &quot;Because we have not heard from him since October 2004 we fear he may not be alive but we still have hopes that our son is safe.&quot; His mother Jo said: &quot;There is nothing worse in life than losing a son, but not knowing what happened to him is even worse.&quot; She added: &quot;I think Cambodians must know through their history what it is like to lose their loved ones. So, if somebody knows what&apos;s happened to Eddie, please come forward, and I thank you very much for your help.&quot; Eddie disappeared in early October 2004, three weeks after beginning a course in Asian and Pacific Studies at Leeds University. He withdrew \u00a33,000 from his bank before he departed. Days later his parents were contacted by the British embassy in Cambodia with news that he had crossed into the country via Thailand. They later learned that he had initially flown into Bangkok, retracing a gap-year trip with friends during which he travelled through south-east Asia. In previous appeals for information Mike Gibson, who has travelled to the country five times to seek his son, suggested Eddie may have travelled alone from Phnom Penh, the capital, to Poipet, a gambling border town, the day before he vanished. It is understood Eddie revisited the town, which has a reputation for crime, several times while in the country. His last known contact with his parents was an email sent on October 24, from Phnom Penh. The message was badly typed and confused. He said he had resolved his problems, was heading home and planned to fly into Heathrow on November 1. He never arrived.

At the time it seemed the right thing to do, like paying tax or queueing at the bus stop. Today carbon offsetting is all the rage, as proved by Tony Blair&apos;s belated conversion following his refusal to limit his long-haul holiday flights. The government now offsets all its ministerial flights, and big businesses such as BSkyB claim to be &quot;carbon neutral&quot;. Meanwhile, the global market in personal, &quot;voluntary&quot; offsetting - worth around \u00a320m in 2005 - is expected to top \u00a3300m over the next three years. Yet despite this growing popularity, the idea that you can cancel out the emissions from flying has always niggled at my conscience, so much so that I have tried to avoid flying ever since. Was it just a form of ethical blood money, I wondered - a wrong rectified with a bit of cash? For a start, offsetting those trips to Bangkok seemed ludicrously cheap - \u00a317 per flight per person, when we were paying fares ranging from \u00a3350 to \u00a3500-plus. Second, it was hard to ignore offsetting&apos;s increasingly controversial image, particularly its associations with planting trees. Forest sequestration, as it is known, is based on classroom science, the idea being that new trees will in their lifetime soak up the CO\u00b2 you produce. &quot;If a plantation is on an area which previously had no forest, you would have a net store of carbon as the tree locks up carbon by being there,&quot; explains Dr Yadvinder Malhi at Oxford University&apos;s Centre for the Environment. If that tree is then used for timber, say, in construction, and another planted in its place, there is a further advantage. &quot;The carbon is locked in longer until that building comes down.&quot; But critics say this is fraught with problems. &quot;Carbon in a tree is not stored safely,&quot; says Jutta Kill, of the environment group Fern. &quot;Trees burn, trees die down, there&apos;s insect infestation.&quot; Last year WWF, Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace issued a statement saying they do not support forestry projects to offset carbon emissions. Such arguments have led certain off setting firms to play down the forestry side of their business. Climate Care, one of Britain&apos;s big two companies in this sector, says that tree planting is a diminishing part of its &quot;portfolio&quot;, accounting for 20% of its trade. The other major player, the Carbon Neutral Company, changed its name from Future Forests to distance itself from a trees-only profile. Still, there are many companies that are not ashamed to trumpet their root-andbranch approach. Treeflights.com plants trees on three sites in Wales, and charges a nononsense rate of \u00a310 for any single flight, \u00a320 for a return. It says its land is held in trust, and will always remain forest. As one plant dies, the argument goes, more take its place. Retailers seem undeterred by any controversy, too. A tree is a powerful image (check out the Tories&apos; new logo) and companies have seized on the idea of planting them as a way of showing they are eco friendly. Timberland, for example, has been planting trees for its customers, while the Co-op promises forest restoration when you buy its car insurance. And in the short term, argues Malhi, tree plantations can be important in fi ghting climate change. &quot;The crucial period for reducing emissions will be over the next 30-40 years and a tree absorbs the most CO\u00b2 during the early period of its life.&quot; Long-term, however, we need to work on alternatives to carbon energy generation or we would soon run out of space. &quot;The biomass of the entire Amazon rainforest is equivalent to the next 10 years of global emissions,&quot; says Malhi. New arguments have recently emerged to further question the value of tree planting, however. Last month, two US-based ecologists claimed that most forests do not have any overall effect on global temperature. Except for a thin band around the equator, forests trap more heat than they help to get rid of by reducing CO\u00b2, they say. Are alternative means of offsetting any better? What about a scheme that promotes foot-operated water pumps in India, saving on the polluting diesel alternative? At least it comes without the forestry baggage. But problems persist. For my Thailand trip, different offset companies gave me very different calculations for the CO\u00b2 my trip would create, which hardly helps their collective credibility. And a major issue with any offsetting project is regulating it. How can consumers - even off set companies - be sure they are making the carbon savings promised? Famously, rock band Coldplay got egg on their face when most of the trees died on a mango plantation they supported in India. Last month, a report from the World Rainforest Movement alleged human rights abuses at an offset project in Mount Elgon, east Uganda, where villagers were forcibly removed from land earmarked for tree planting. And tomorrow night, a report on the BBC1&apos;s Inside Out programme will claim that workers at a project in the west of that country are being exploited and paid well below subsistence rates. Yet the popularity of offsetting shows there is an appetite out there for people to at least attempt to ameliorate their environmental impact. And the emergence of an industrywide accreditation scheme known as the gold standard should give consumers more confidence. It is backed by WWF, among others, and guarantees that projects have some sustainable benefit to the community. At the moment, the Carbon Neutral Company offers one such project - a wind farm in New Zealand - that the public can sign up to. More can be found at Myclimate, Atmosfair and Climate Friendly. But where does this leave the angst-ridden traveller? To fly or not to fly? Are offsets just a cop-out, doing nothing to address the underlying issue - that a big net reduction of emissions is what is required, not simply methods to prevent the current levels rising any further? Pressure groups such as Greenpeace, WWF and FoE say that the public should use only schemes with gold standard verification, but air travel should still be a last resort, and people should first consider alternative methods or rethink their holiday choice. This was not the signal coming from Blair this week, who argued that climate change was for the scientists to sort out and it was &quot;a bit impractical really&quot; to expect people to alter their behaviour. Let us hope that, as has been demonstrated before, he is out of step with public opinion. \u00b7 Inside Out is on BBC1 tomorrow at 7.30pm.", "publicationDate": "2007-01-11T12:16:28Z", "tags": ["Environment", "Ethical and green living", "Life and style", "Travel", "Climate change", "Travel and transport", "Transport", "UK news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jan/11/ethicalliving.g2", "title": "Dominic Murphy questions the validity of carbon offsetting", "sentences": ["For a start, offsetting those trips to Bangkok seemed ludicrously cheap - \u00a317 per flight per person, when we were paying fares ranging from \u00a3350 to \u00a3500-plus."]}, {"article": "Softly spoken and unassuming Luke Donald may be but he is not afraid to voice his rapidly increasing self-belief. Having taken a one-shot lead in the first round of the Sony Open, with his driving and approach play in sparkling order, Donald underlined the strides he has taken in the past 12 months. He finished a career high ninth on the PGA Tour money list in the United States last year, started 2007 with a seventh place at the Mercedes-Benz Championship on Maui last week and is now confident of challenging at the top of the leaderboard. &quot;I feel I&apos;m getting better every year,&quot; he said after shooting a seven-under-par 63 in the opening round here. &quot;It has not quite yet resulted in a lot of wins, winning majors and that kind of stuff, but I feel I&apos;m getting a lot closer than I was a year or two ago. &quot;I&apos;ve gotten to the stage where I&apos;m expecting to be up there and contending and winning each week I play. That was probably not quite there a year ago.&quot; The world No10 reeled off nine birdies and two bogeys at a breezy Waialae Country Club. Donald is regarded as a premier iron player and he was certainly on target with his approach shots, making all but one of his birdies from inside 15 feet on a course that demands shotmaking to take precedence over power. South Korea&apos;s KJ Choi, helped by a 44ft eagle putt at the 9th, shot a 64 to sit second, with the world No2 Jim Furyk and his fellow American Will MacKenzie a further stroke back in third. The PGA Tour veteran Jeff Sluman, the 1999 champion, was among a group of eight bunched on 66 while Michelle Wie shot a 78 that left her second to last. Of the other big names playing in the first full-field tournament of the season the US Open champion, Geoff Ogilvy of Australia, carded a 67 and the Fijian world No5 Vijay Singh, who won at Kapalua last week, a 71. Wie, playing alongside the men for the 13th time in a professional event, effectively ended her chances of making the cut after an erratic display of driving. The 17-year-old missed every fairway on the front nine and finished with six bogeys, two double bogeys and two birdies. &quot;It was very frustrating because, if I got the ball on the fairway, I could have shot really low today,&quot; said Wie. &quot;My irons felt great, my short game felt great and my putting felt great, and putting is usually the one that lets me down.&quot; She declined to blame her travails on a heavily strapped right wrist, a long-term injury for which she is having treatment. &quot;It is what it is and I&apos;m having acupuncture and physiotherapy on it every day.&quot; Wie became the first woman to make the cut on a major men&apos;s tour in more than 60 years at the Asian Tour&apos;s SK Telecom Open in South Korea last year.

The Asian No1, Jeev Milkha Singh, and his playing partner YE Yang did halve their match with Paul McGinley and Anthony Wall. But even in that match Ballesteros pointed to the positives. &quot;My players have the experience of the Ryder Cup and of last year&apos;s Royal Trophy,&quot; he said. &quot;At the 7th hole we were in the bunker and they were comfortably on the green but we won the hole and that was down to a lack of experience, they lost their focus.&quot; Ballesteros, the team&apos;s non-playing captain, will keep the same pairings for today&apos;s four-balls.", "publicationDate": "2007-01-13T23:34:09Z", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport", "Luke Donald"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jan/13/golf.gdnsport3", "title": "Golf: Sparkling Donald takes confident lead", "sentences": ["Europe secured a three-point lead over Asia after the opening foursomes as they began their defence of the Royal Trophy in Bangkok yesterday."]}, {"article": "Two women are waiting at a baggage carousel at Heathrow ...

On board, with a glass of champagne in hand, flying began to seem a bit more refined. After a delicious meal I stretched out at 167 degrees (you have to upgrade to Royal First for that final 13 degrees) and actually managed to sleep soundly.

Currently the two main arenas have roofs which can be closed in extreme heat conditions, but yesterday play began with them open even though everyone but Tennis Australia knew the winds were blowing from the north, which usually brings a sharp rise in temperature. Maria Sharapova, the No1 seed, began visibly to wilt in the heat after winning the first set against France&apos;s Camille Pin. A bathroom break at one set all appeared to revive her but having established a 5-0 lead she faded once more, allowing Pin to level again and come within two points of victory. The temperature pushed up to 40.5C (105F), with oven-dry winds sending eucalyptus leaves rattling around the pathways. Once the opening matches were completed, play was suspended on the outside courts and the roofs closed on the Rod Laver and Vodafone arenas. In the cool of the air-conditioning Kim Clijsters romped to a 6-0, 6-0 first-round victory over Vasilisa Bardina of Russia and Martina Hingis beat Nathalie Dechy 6-0, 6-2. Before that, however, Sharapova went through agony. &quot;It&apos;s inhuman to play for three hours in that kind of heat,&quot; she said, although she agreed it was the same for Pin. To make matters worse she pinched an abdominal muscle and had to call for the trainer. For a moment it appeared she might be unable to complete the match, but she is made of sterner stuff and won 6-3, 4-6, 9-7. &quot;I&apos;m not a quitter.&quot; The tournament rules dictate that once a match has begun the roof must remain open, although common sense dictated the opposite. &quot;It was hard to think about what you were doing on court. In such heat your mind does not work properly.&quot; Sharapova, who can be every bit as ungenerous or dismissive of her opponents as the Williams sisters, implied that she would have won in two quick sets if it had not been for the heat. This was to do Pin a huge disservice, for she played extremely well and intelligently, belying the fact that previously she had won only two matches at this level. When the third set began Pin&apos;s pins were shaking with fatigue. &quot;I had no power in them and that&apos;s why I went 5-0 down.&quot; That she recovered and then served for the match was remarkable, no matter how much Sharapova was struggling herself. &quot;Maria played a great game when I served, like she aimed for the perfect strokes and I couldn&apos;t touch the ball. That&apos;s why she&apos;s No2 in the world.&quot; &quot;Delusional&quot; is how Sharapova described herself during the final set, when her one object was to keep the points as short as possible. Just how much it has taken out of her, only time will tell. &quot;I&apos;ll be ready,&quot; she said. Few would doubt it. The Sharapova will is indomitable.

He spirited his men out of the vehicle and swept towards the crowd, flanked by officers Mark Browne, a field artillery operator, and Kirk Bailey, a 25-year-old sharpshooter. The three glanced up and down the bustling street, then at each other, and began moving towards their target. Normally the setting would have been Iraq, where the men from Fort Collins, Colorado, have served since 2005. But this was not Baghdad. It was the entrance to Baronetti, one of Rio de Janeiro&apos;s most exclusive nightclubs. Just a few weeks ago Lt Feldmayer and his colleagues were hunting al-Qaida operatives in Balad, a town in the Sunni Triangle not far from where 10 British servicemen died when an RAF aircraft was shot down in 2005. Tonight the targets were of a different kind: scantily clad Brazilian women. Rio has long been a tourist favourite, attracting around 2 million foreigners each year. But that number is now being bolstered by a growing number of war-weary North American servicemen keen to unwind. It is now the hot ticket for US soldiers and military contractors based in the most dangerous corners of the globe. According to the head of one US tour company that offers 10-day packages to Rio for around $3,000 (\u00a31,520) and expects to bring around 300 soldiers and contractors to Brazil this year, the number of military customers has quadrupled since the beginning of the Iraq war. &quot;We&apos;re making up for lost time,&quot; said Lt Mark Browne, a tank operator with the trademark short-back-and-sides, as he prepared for his seventh consecutive night on the tiles after a year spent operating a Howitzer cannon in Iraq. For Lt Feldmayer and his men the trip is part of 30 days&apos; ordinary leave from the army after 12 months in the Middle East. Private security forces and contractors from companies such as Halliburton and Control Risks Group are also heading for the beaches of Rio in search of tender loving care. Other US soldiers come as part of the Rest and Recuperation scheme, under which the US government allows up to 15 days&apos; holiday, with transport paid for, intended to &quot;provide respite from hostile fire and imminent danger areas&quot;. Created in 2004, the scheme is geared towards soldiers involved in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom based in 16 countries, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Pakistan, Syria, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. According to the army website, &quot;the purpose is to provide relief to servicemen and women and DoD [Department of Defence] civilians and enable them to get away from the stress of the combat mission - if only for a little while&quot;. Many R&amp;R soldiers head home, while others make for government-run recreation centres in Germany, Korea, Orlando or Hawaii. For the remainder, Rio is now one of the top choices. The heaving dance floor of Baronetti, a few blocks from Ipanema beach, is certainly a world away from the bloodshed of US &quot;combat theatres&quot;. Tables here cost up to 1,500 Brazilian reals (\u00a3360), while the 30-metre bar is packed with hundreds of bottles of expensive whisky, champagne and vodka. &quot;You know, I don&apos;t really like to talk about it [the war]. But after the worst year of my life, this has made it one of the best,&quot; said Lt Feldmayer, sitting by a small table cluttered with cans of Red Bull, orange juice and two bottles of vodka. &quot;Being in a situation where you&apos;re always worried about the road erupting underneath you is really not cool ... it&apos;s difficult, trying to keep yourself and the people around you alive all the time. For us, this trip was always the light at the end of the tunnel.&quot; One of the companies behind this new influx to Brazil is Miami-based Tours Gone Wild, which promises customers the &quot;vacation of a lifetime&quot; in Rio. The TGW website features photo galleries of &quot;Brazil Girl hotties&quot; where busty and bronzed Brazilian women smile enticingly into the camera. It also presents a two-minute promotional video where muscle-bound men admire bottom-wiggling women in upmarket nightclubs. &quot;They [the military] kind of found us by accident,&quot; said Santiago Mejia, the company&apos;s co-founder. &quot;At first it was crazy. These guys started emailing us from tents in Iraq. Now we get emails and calls ... from Afghanistan, Iraq, Germany and Kuwait.&quot; Tour promoters say they operate a &quot;don&apos;t ask, don&apos;t tell&quot; policy about the excesses of clients&apos; trips. &quot;If they want to find Help, they&apos;re going to find it,&quot; said Mr Mejia, referring to Rio&apos;s most famous prostitution joint, in Copacabana. The temptations of nocturnal Rio far outweigh the opportunity to visit Sugar Loaf mountain or tour one of the city&apos;s shantytowns (&quot;I&apos;ve seen enough of that in Iraq,&quot; says Lt Feldmayer on hearing that favela tours are popular among tourists in Rio). As well as upmarket nightclubs in Rio&apos;s beachside districts, trips to the city&apos;s massage parlours are popular, although Tours Gone Wild&apos;s directors insist their guides are forbidden from taking their clients to such hangouts. A top attraction on the military trail is the Termas Centaurus in Ipanema, where for a cover price of 320 Brazilian reals you are given a white dressing gown and the pick of its high-class call girls. Mr Mejia said the tours had proved so successful that most of their military clients now came because of a colleague&apos;s recommendation. &quot;Some of my friends are nervous about coming to Rio,&quot; said Lt Feldmayer of his colleagues in Iraq. &quot;They see the crime, they hear about the problems. But I&apos;ll tell all the guys about this trip. And I guarantee you that in the next two years, 65% of them will come and do the same thing.&quot; In fact the seemingly non-stop hedonism seemed tempered by just one detail: the thought of returning to Iraq. &quot;Do I want to be there? Do any of us want to be there?&quot; said Lt Feldmayer who, after two strong vodka cocktails, was in reflective mood. &quot;Of course not.&quot; He looked across the dance floor. &quot;But at least we are here now. This has really turned the year around.&quot; Backstory In the 1950s, during the Korean war, prostitutes known as &quot;military comfort women&quot; flocked to &quot;rest and recreation&quot; sites in South Korea to earn money from troops. During the Vietnam war, Bangkok was at the centre of a huge influx of soldiers, with troops dubbing rest and recreation excursions &quot;intoxication and intercourse breaks&quot;. Saigon became a nightlife hotspot in the mid-1970s as GIs kicked back in bars and brothels, spawning huge prostitution and drugs industries. Little has been written about the sexual escapades of troops based in Iraq, although reports have emerged of at least one brothel in Baghdad&apos;s Green Zone. Some suggest that because Iraq is Islamic, and because of high danger levels outside camps, soldiers have looked to other regions. The increase in women soldiers is also cited as a reason for a decline in war zone &quot;comfort stations&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2007-01-18T08:50:29Z", "tags": ["World news", "US news", "Brazil", "Americas"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/18/usa.brazil", "title": "American soldiers set their sights on delights of Rio", "sentences": ["During the Vietnam war, Bangkok was at the centre of a huge influx of soldiers, with troops dubbing rest and recreation excursions &quot;intoxication and intercourse breaks&quot;."]}, {"article": "I&apos;m afraid I&apos;ve missed most of the Big Brother brouhaha. While Jade Goody and her feral chums were venting their bile at an actress that 97% of us hadn&apos;t heard of until a few weeks ago, I was contemplating the glory of Angkor Wat. As I was chatting to our guide, a fat, middle-aged British man walked past, arm-in-arm with his tiny Thai girlfriend. This scenario is often a cause of embarrassment for Asian men, raising as it does both realities about relative prosperity, and arcane myths about male sexual potency, or lack of it. But it wasn&apos;t this that bothered the guide. &quot;Why do western men always prefer dark-skinned girls when they come to Asia?&quot; he asked. &quot;In Cambodia, we think light skins are more beautiful.&quot; Sunny Hundal has already mentioned the extent to which the Bollywood system that spawned Shilpa Shetty is infested with racism. But it&apos;s really just a reflection of attitudes that pervade many Asian societies. Indian matchmaking ads seem obsessed with skin tone, reflecting the continuing caste divisions in the country: how might Shilpa&apos;s family feel if she brought home an African boyfriend? The Japanese sneer at the Koreans, the Thais at the Cambodians. The Chinese diaspora in Malaysia and Indonesia is viewed with deep suspicion. White people are clumsy, loud and smell of milk. Black people have uncontrollable sexual urges. These views are not universally held, but they are widespread, as much among the business and political elites as among the Asian equivalents of Jade and Danielle. More importantly, those who hold them express them shamelessly, as statements of fact. The construction &quot;I&apos;m not a racist, but ... &quot; is unknown. And if I, an outsider, a guest in an Asian nation, challenge such opinions, am I simply imposing my own occidental mindset on another culture, indulging in yet another manifestation of well-meaning imperialism? Can it be racist to oppose racism? Not that this is just an Asian disease, of course. Brazil, the birthplace of housemate Cleo Rocos, is a society where racial and economic divisions seem to operate hand in hand. Even Wales, which spawned Ian &quot;H who used to be in Steps&quot; Watkins, fosters a cheerful line in anti-English abuse. The homeland of Jermaine Jackson and Dirk Benedict? That&apos;s a whole other story. And look deep in your own souls, proudly liberal Guardian readers of all hues. Have you never uttered a word, or had a thought, that might be considered racist? I have. The mistake of Jade and friends was to do it on telly; moreover, they did it on telly in a society that is unusually sensitive to such things. Like Mel Gibson, Michael Richards, Simone Clarke or the unwitting stooges who fell for Borat&apos;s spiel, they broke the 11th commandment; they got caught. This is not to excuse their words, or to contend that racism is not a serious problem. But on a global scale, cretinous asides about Indians eating undercooked food come fairly low down the pecking order of abuse. Inevitably, though, evidence of racism tends to be anecdotal, rather than empirical. So here&apos;s an anecdote. A Nigerian friend was looking for an apartment in Bangkok. He phoned to see whether there were vacancies in a particular block, and was told there were several, but when he turned up in person, the woman on duty said they were full up. Suspicious, he called the manager, and asked whether he&apos;d been refused because of his race. &quot;I&apos;m sorry about that,&quot; said the manager. &quot;Of course there are vacancies. But the girl thought you might be an Indian, and we don&apos;t allow them because their cooking smells so bad.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-01-19T12:53:32Z", "tags": ["Society", "Race issues", "Big Brother", "Reality TV", "Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jan/19/racismisnormal", "title": "A world of abuse", "sentences": ["A Nigerian friend was looking for an apartment in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "This Christmas, along with two identical jumpers, I got a copy of Chantelle Houghton&apos;s Living the Dream: My Story. It&apos;s the sort of book that must make lumberjacks everywhere wonder why they bother.  In the whirlwind of last-minute giving and taking, you end up with some strange choices. Books that are unlikely ever to be read. I bought my father, who&apos;s never cooked anything more complex than soup, a copy of Ramsay&apos;s latest recipe book in the hope he might try his hand at a Beef Wellington. In the cold light of January, this seems unlikely. So what happens to all those books? They sit on bookshelves, certainly. They are circulated, perpetual presents. Sometimes they&apos;re turned back into book vouchers. You can sell them on eBay or throw them away. I checked with Friends of the Earth, and there are no hard and fast rules for mulching a book - putting it in with the old Sunday papers is fine. Of course, many people prefer to do something more charitable. I thought I&apos;d found the solution when I came across Book Aid International, which sends books to libraries in sub-Saharan Africa and Palestine where the paperbacks we take for granted can cost a third of a month&apos;s wage. This is vital work. It gets in at the ground level of development, keeping kids interested in reading, improving literacy. It makes available the basic knowledge needed for carpentry, mechanics, tailoring, soldering, hygiene and cookery. There&apos;s very little they haven&apos;t covered. At a higher level, the books they supply are used to train future lawyers, doctors, accountants, IT professionals. The books go into the universities of Tanzania, Malawi and Sierra Leone, and camel-borne libraries cross north-east Kenya between isolated villages. But while Book Aid does accept some specific books from individuals, I found they get much of what they need direct from publishers. Like most charities, they&apos;d rather just have your money. It costs them \u00a31.25 to send a book out, and that&apos;s the cost of making sure the library gets what it needs, rather than just the postage. So sell the book and send them a cheque. With the problem of what to do with Chantelle still unsolved, I turned in the end to BookCrossing. The principle behind it is that you leave unwanted books in pubs, telephone boxes and buses, where they&apos;re picked up by total strangers. According to Lynne Moores, a veteran, there are now half-a-million bookcrossers worldwide. Despite the slightly weird terminology - they talk about releasing books into the wild - it&apos;s a charming idea, and one that appeals deeply to bibliophiles. I don&apos;t feel that strongly about pulping Living the Dream, but the idea of destroying a book - any book - is heresy to bookcrossers. And even the books in charity shops get pulped if they don&apos;t sell. Lynne started bookcrossing with a book she didn&apos;t like. Rather than feeding it page by page to a nesting hamster, she left it in a public place in the hope that it would find a more appreciative reader. Every book gets a number, and the original owner can watch the book migrate (I&apos;m at it now) on bookcrossing.com. You can even see what each reader thought about it on the way. Some 5,000 books later (most of which, it seems, were released in Oxford pubs), Lynne&apos;s seen her books end up in South Africa and Bangkok. She says it&apos;s no longer about disposing of unwanted books - more about finding new audiences for the books she&apos;s enjoyed. She&apos;ll even buy seven or eight copies of a favourite to release. Which is why publishers are beginning to get interested. If you find yourself desperate for something to read in a hostel in Kathmandu, then hell - you might be grateful that someone left a copy of Living the Dream or Ashley Cole&apos;s My Defence behind. There&apos;s an appreciative reader out there for every story - even if sometimes the book has to travel several thousand miles to find them.", "publicationDate": "2007-01-23T15:11:03Z", "tags": ["Books"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/jan/23/releasingbooksintothewild", "title": "Releasing books into the wild", "sentences": ["Some 5,000 books later (most of which, it seems, were released in Oxford pubs), Lynne&apos;s seen her books end up in South Africa and Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Flights: 12Miles flown: 24,982Destinations: Manchester, Bangkok, Sydney, Singapore, London, Munich, Geneva, Courchevel, D\u00fcsseldorf, FrankfurtNights in a hotel: 16Nights on a dancefloor: 7Satisfaction rating: 9/10 My mood today is one of barely containable depression. I am in a factory just outside Munich. My primary view out of the horribly stained window is of a series of more, extraordinarily ugly factories and a number of moustached employees. I feel engulfed by industrial fumes and a particularly pernicious brand of polyester. Yes, January can be a grim month. The magnificence of the new year holiday seems as distant as French Polynesia. But how magnificent it was. I smile at the memory of Bangkok and my splendidly alcoholic celebration at its futuristic Bed Supperclub. I wish I could have spent a few more days at the Sydney Cricket Ground. And I marvel at the efficiency of Singapore. Boring? Oh no (go to super-club Zouk). Relaxing? Oh yes (stay at The Fullerton). Wow. The memories have suddenly lifted my mood. As it happens, January hasn&apos;t been all that bad. Granted, the first business flight of the year \u2013 the deeply unprestigious BA948 to Munich \u2013 is an experience every well-worn business traveller dreads. And I&apos;ll accept that D\u00fcsseldorf isn&apos;t Sydney. And I&apos;ll reluctantly concede that my clients aren&apos;t called Elle or Sienna or Scarlett but Nigel and Kamelshitt and Gaiy. Yet I&apos;ve rather enjoyed the sense of warm familiarity that comes with being in Europe. My London cab driver cracks jokes I find funny (Knock Knock? Who&apos;s there? Europe? Europe who? No no, YOU&apos;RE a poo!). And my team has welcomed me back with open arms. There have been hugs and even a few awkward kisses. They&apos;ve worked hard; I&apos;ve worked hard. A real sense of stimulation and achievement: now you don&apos;t get that from downing Kamikaze, even in the most upmarket Thai bar. Last week concluded with more hard work. The slopes of Courchevel provided the setting for a gruelling examination of my mental and physical stamina. I didn&apos;t risk skiing \u2013 too risky, of course - but I did write one, very significant professional email and indulge in a spot of extreme clubbing. La Grange is a venue of some calibre: funky house, black sofas and astonishingly obese Russians scoffing Beluga. In fact, this diary is proving remarkably cathartic. The black clouds have almost completely lifted and I&apos;ve only written 372 words. January can be grim but it hasn&apos;t been at all. And the best thing: the flying (apologies in advance to those of you who regularly lose sleep over carbon emissions). I love flying for business or pleasure, I really do. But do you? I bet that some of you don&apos;t: the endless queues, fog, lukewarm coffee and BAA&apos;s cheese-grater seats can make the entire experience a tedious chore. But there is hope, I promise you. Here are my top tips for enjoyable flying on business: Get a frequent flyer cardYou&apos;ll get miles. You&apos;ll get freebies. And best of all, you always get lounge access. Otherwise, you and your laptop may be consigned to departure Gate 3, with its host of appalling metal seats. Choose your seat onlineWhy leave something so significant to chance? Choose an emergency exit seat or, even better, if you can, sit in 1A or 1C on a European flight, the upper deck in long-haul business class and 1A or 1K in long-haul first class. Trust me, I&apos;ve tested this out enough times. Never check in luggageUnless you really want to wait for hours as baggage handlers muster the energy to load your bags on to an unfailingly malfunctioning conveyor belt.  Never, ever fly economyDownsizing? Cutting costs? Don&apos;t be fooled, flying economy is a catastrophe. Fly business in Europe; and try to fly first for long haul. Carry an MP3 playerWhatever I suggest, frustrations are inevitable. So carry the best relaxant in the world: music. Fashion a playlist of your 10 favourite songs and shut it all out. Carry provisionsI would recommend Fisherman&apos;s Friend Lemon - a lozenge that presses all the right buttons. Happy travelling to you all. Speak in a fortnight.

Life is not undiluted joy, though, and it&apos;s not just because British beer is hard to find. Electricity supplies and telephone connections don&apos;t always work, and in recent years the country has been hit by the 2004 tsunami, bird flu, an ongoing insurgency in the south and the Sars virus. Many British residents are retirees, according to the embassy, taking advantage of Thailand&apos;s friendly retirement resident visas. Of the rest, businesspeople tend to flock to the big cities such as Bangkok and Chiang Mai, while tourism industry players hit resorts such as Phuket, Phang Nga, Pattaya - which is also home to more than a handful of former, and probably current, British cons - and Koh Samui. There is also a large teacher population. How is it for you? Andrew Kemp, 40, has lived in Phuket for eight years. When I arrived in Thailand, learning the language was a priority.

I&apos;m now in a position where I have 250 Thai staff, and lots of Thai friends. But although we can talk, and I know them well, it&apos;s not the same as friendship back home. The subtleties of relationships are lost through language and cultural differences. People who move here often think one day they&apos;ll be accepted as Thais.

How to do it Thailand offers a wide range of different visas for people wanting to settle, and the bureaucracy is relatively painless, if a little laborious. If a company brings you to Thailand to work, make sure they sort out the relevant work visas. It&apos;s a good idea to engage someone locally who can help process your applications. The Thais often find it uncomfortable dealing directly with foreigners in these matters, and the language barrier can be a real problem. Rents are very reasonable, and you can buy a flat in a condominium with certain conditions; however, foreigners cannot own land. It&apos;s more expensive to live in Thailand than you might think. As a foreigner, especially in business, you are expected to spend more money and to host more events than the locals.

Mr Thaksin had put his personal stamp on the mammoth project that boasts the world&apos;s tallest control tower and second biggest building and hoped it would reflect his soaring ambition. But the airport, designed to cater for 45 million passengers annually, was mired in corruption allegations that critics contend explain its disastrous shortcomings.

The coots and moorhens, present in number, were bobbing and diving, looking almost joyful at the astonishing January warmth. They were bobbing and diving amidst plastic Lucozade bottles, Chinese take-away containers and the like, but they didn&apos;t seem to mind. A solitary swan - perhaps its partner, who&apos;s usually here, was having an away-day in some cleaner bit of local park - breasted imperiously through the accumulation of plastic carrier bags in the corner of a dock, still a pristine white, testament to the effectiveness of avian preening and stain-proofing. I was contemplating the concept of &quot;legacy&quot; - a concept much in the news of late, as Tony Blair does a Dame Nellie Melba, running around the world making his final, final, really final any-day-now, bows, in frantic search for some, any, &quot;success&quot; that will provide a comfortable headline for his memoirs. And there&apos;s a legacy here, in the now not-too-dreadfully-dirty waters of the canal, left by hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Londoners who had a drink, snatched a meal, then chucked its remnants into a drain or gully, to be washed or blown here. Most of this plastic will survive - smashed into pieces perhaps, but essentially unchanged in form - for thousands of years. Hopefully most of it will be scooped up by the British Waterways boats that ply these waters like miniature basking sharks, metal jaws open wide. But then it will progress only a little down-river to the great fetid mounds beside the Thames past which I recently also cycled. They are on the north bank, opposite Erith, on the end of the &quot;scenic&quot; London loop walking route. So here is, waiting perhaps for some future archaeologist, one Londoner&apos;s legacy to history. Imagine the museum label. &quot;Tom Smith, lived in London c 2007, threw Coca-Cola can into the canal.&quot; Not perhaps what one would wish for posterity. Yet I&apos;m not picking on this Tom Smith, or even more generally on the litter-bugs who taint the canal - that&apos;s the legacy of nearly all of us who&apos;ve lived in the west in the 20th and 21st centuries. My own? Well I spent the best part of a decade around rural New South Wales working and studying hard, and living almost entirely on microwaved meals - that must be several thousand plastic trays in dumps around various country towns. Then in Bangkok - not quite so bad perhaps, since I often ate out with proper plates and metal cutlery - but plenty of, probably horribly durable, foam containers for my khow pad talay (fried rice with seafood) from the restaurant downstairs, for those nights I felt like eating in with BBC World. Now? Well I try pretty hard to reduce this legacy. I get a weekly organic delivery fruit and veg box, its contents nearly all in brown paper that goes into the worm farm. I&apos;ve given up - well almost given up, except for the occasional night when it&apos;s 10pm, I&apos;m tired, dinnerless and walking past Sainsbury&apos;s towards an empty fridge - the microwave meals approach. But still, each week there&apos;s a bag of rubbish - rubbish that will be around in wasteful form long after I&apos;ve gone. By bulk it is mostly milk and juice cartons: yes they should be able to be recycled, but where are the facilities? I&apos;ve thought about getting a juicer, but given that I hardly survive mornings now, would I really be able to manage that at breakfast? And wash up the complicated gizmo afterwards? But there&apos;s more. From the Ocado order, the plastic tray from the mushrooms. I forgot they came that way. The metal bottle of hair mousse - probably should be recyclable, but who knows how or where? Cotton buds: their plastic stalks will probably be threatening some earthworm millennia hence. (And that&apos;s without thinking of the damage done by the six pints of water needed to produce the cotton for each - some dried-up lake in Africa or eastern Europe goes on to the legacy tally...) The fact is that it simply is not easy to say &quot;stop, this won&apos;t be my legacy&quot;. You might write the great 21st-century novel, or become a member of the first Green government of England and Wales, or even make some amazing scientific discovery like the cure for the common cold, yet this, your other, physical, polluting legacy will most likely outlive that. In the museum constructed by a successor species, millennia hence: &quot;Plastic fruit tray, c 2007. Relic of Homo sapiens vastans. Perfectly preserved.

Unfortunately, there&apos;s absolutely no chance of him deviating from his stock response on an ongoing police investigation; last week he gave a very testy reply - &quot;For very obvious reasons, I have absolutely nothing at all to say about that inquiry&quot; - to a Tory backbencher who raised comparisons with Richard Nixon and the Watergate scandal. Other topics bubbling under include a rising number of failing schools, the Tanzanian radar deal, today&apos;s civil service strike, the casinos decision, the gay adoption row over a Catholic opt-out, and, of course, Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr Blair is also likely to praise today&apos;s anti-terrorist operation in Birmingham. David Cameron, the Conservative leader, may avoid the Catholic question, as there are splits within the shadow cabinet on the matter, while Sir Menzies Campbell may be tempted to go for the throat over Lord Levy. Midday For the first time in months there is no tribute to fallen UK soldiers abroad. Liberal Democrat Andrew Stunell (Hazel Grove) gets the first question. With Charles Kennedy, his party&apos;s former leader, behind him, Mr Stunnell goes on falling police numbers. Mr Blair insists that police numbers have risen. Labour&apos;s Angela Smith (Basildon and East Thurrock) manages to get a topical question in on today&apos;s takeover of Corus steelmakers. The prime minister promises continued support for the British steel industry in a difficult international market. David Cameron speaks next - and he goes on the Home Office.  Can Mr Blair guarantee that John Reid will be in place in four and a half months, let alone the two and a half years Mr Reid says he needs to reform the department? Mr Blair does not reply directly. The Tory leader comes back: &quot;We&apos;ve got long-term problems and a short-term chief executive.&quot; Mr Reid cannot plan without knowing his job is safe, Mr Cameron claims. The prime minister recites the government&apos;s record on building prison places.  Mr Cameron claims that John Reid&apos;s bitter enemy is the chancellor, &quot;who wants him to fail&quot;, so Mr Reid has no chance of getting extra funding for the Home Office. Mr Blair ignores this jibe, but says that the Tories oppose extra investment in jails. But Mr Blair isn&apos;t going to be here to implement his policy, Mr Cameron says, asking: &quot;Can&apos;t he see it is time for him to go?&quot; The Tory leader adds that Labour&apos;s deputy leadership candidates are falling over each other to oppose Mr Blair&apos;s foreign policy, while &quot;the other half&quot; of the cabinet is manning picket lines protesting against NHS policy. &quot;Authority is draining away. It is now in the national interest for him to go,&quot; concludes Mr Cameron. It&apos;s in the national interest for the economy to grow, education standards to rise and crime to fall, and we are making sure this happens, says Mr Blair. A Labour MP complains that Tory Wandworth council is closing Wandsworth museum and Batteresea Arts Centre. 12.10pm Sir Menzies Campbell, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, complains about falling conviction rates for rape - for both male and female victims. The prime minister says that the government is looking at it, but that 80% of cases of alleged rape involve known assailants, which makes securing a conviction more difficult. Sir Ming returns, saying that victims are often as devastated by the police investigation as much as the crime itself. Is the prime minister satisfied with police care? Mr Blair says that it is far better than a few decades ago. Labour MP Kate Hoey complains about the closure of an accident and emergency department in her Vauxhall, London, constituency - a sore point for the cabinet which rises massive cheers on Tory benches. A Lib Dem MP asks why Mr Blair will not answer questions about the cash-for-honours investigation. The prime minister rolls out his usual answer: &quot;For perfectly obvious reasons there is nothing I can say on this subject.&quot; 12.15pm Labour MP Jamie Reed - whose Copeland consitutency includes the Sellafield facility - praises UK-French nuclear power collaboration. Lib Dem MP Paul Holmes complains that 420 engineering jobs have gone to Asia from his Chesterfield constituency.  The prime minister has sympathy, but he praises Gordon Brown&apos;s economic record. The SDLP&apos;s Eddie McGrady (South Down) brings up claims that MI5 funded payments to informers and loyalist paramilitaries. Does this not warrant a full statement to the house? Any form of collusion would be completely wrong and would be regretted, says Mr Blair.  We&apos;re looking at the report and will take whatever action is appropriate, but this involved a minority of people and should not take away from the majority of the work of the police in Northern Ireland, he adds. Tory MP David Heathcoat-Amory (Wells), a former minister and arch-Europhobe, points out that Germany is attempting to revive the EU constitution, and asks why Mr Blair is appointing two officials to help in secret.  Will he keep a promise to have a referendum if the constitution comes back on the table? There&apos;s no secret policy, Germany is obliged to take forward proposals after the pause, let&apos;s see what they come up, our position on a referndum remains unchanged, and our bilateral relations with Germany are good, says Mr Blair, before scolding Mr Heathcoat-Amory for his &quot;absurd and antiquated&quot; approach to Europe. 12.20pm Brecon and Radnorshire MP Roger Williams, a Liberal Democrat, raises the case of a constituent of his, Kirsty Jones, who was raped and murdered in Thailand. Will the prime minister ensure that the police investigation does not go cold? We&apos;ve been closely involved with Bangkok on this case, and with the parents on a weekly basis, Mr Blair says. Dai Havard (Lab, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney) wants two assurances on workers&apos; rights: that the Warwick agreement - a 2004 peace deal between the government and the unions - will be kept, and that the &quot;siren voices&quot; asking for a withdrawal from the EU social chapter from &quot;dysfunctional policy wonks at Number 10&quot; will be ignored. Mr Blair jokes that he was with him until that final remark. The SNP&apos;s leader, Alex Salmond, asks: &quot;Is there a cover up in Downing Street?&quot;, saying that Mr Blair&apos;s relationship with George Bush is now being overshadowed by the prime minister&apos;s parallels with &quot;Richard Milhouse Nixon&quot;, the former US president who resigned in the wake of the Watergate affair. The prime minister complains that Mr Salmond does not &quot;dare&quot; raise the subject of Scottish independence. David Barrow (Lab, South Ribble) asks an extremely long-winded question which ends up simply praising the RSPB. Who says the mother of all parliaments has lost its teeth? The Speaker has to cut him short. Crime has fallen, Mr Blair repeats to a Tory MP, who asks if he shares faith in the British criminal justice system. Neil Turner (Lab, Wigan) praises his local hospital. He invites Mr Blair to come to Wigan to open it. Mr Blair is noncommittal. Lib Dem MP David Heath (Somerton and Frome) gets it in the neck from Mr Blair for complaining of inadequate prison places. Tony Wright (Lab, Cannock Chase) asks simply: &quot;Is it true we have to pay GPs a lot more money to do a lot less work, and now we have to pay them a lot more money to do the work we paid them to stop doing?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; says the prime minister. &quot;I don&apos;t always stick up for the GPs, but this time I will. There&apos;s nothing wrong with our GPs being paid the best in Europe if they&apos;re providing the best service, and I believe they are.&quot; Tory Bernard Jenkin (North Essex) worries that the EU is underming Nato, as forewarned by Bill Clinton at St Malo nearly 10 years ago. Mr Blair complains that Mr Jenkin is shaking his head before the prime minister has even given him an answer.

They have been together for nine years. The brief: &apos;We want to do something special this year as we are getting married in May. Our ideal holiday would be at least one month long, and somewhere hot, like Brazil, but we only have a weekend and \u00a3400 to spare. We&apos;d like to go away for a cultural weekend, with a mixture of art, music, wildlife, sunshine, independence and the unknown. We used to live in Lisbon and loved it there; there is a very romantic, faded glory and beauty about it. We also lived in Warsaw for a while, after meeting on a Tefl course, and spent six months in India. In hot weather we have camped or stayed somewhere cheap so we can spend more on good food, drink and doing stuff.&apos; The budget: \u00a3400 The solution Nikki Tinto: I recommend a weekend of &apos;living like a local&apos; in Barcelona, at one of Into Barcelona&apos;s funky apartments set in a maze of ancient alleyways in the trendy Born district, not far from the sea. They&apos;ll get more space and independence for their money than staying in a hotel. The Picasso Museum is around the corner, as are a host of bars and restaurants offering everything from traditional tapas to cutting-edge gastronomy. To satisfy their culture lust, Into Barcelona offers quirky walking tours to help them discover what they might never have found by staying there for a month. They could be taken behind the doors of local artists&apos; and designers&apos; studios, for example. One-bedroom apartments from \u00a375 a night (www.i-escape.com/intobarcelona). Return flights Bristol-Barcelona with Easyjet from \u00a3100 each. Alastair Sawday: I rule out a cheap weekend flight for ecological reasons. So - somewhere close-ish, vaguely exotic, inexpensive. How about taking a ferry to Le Havre in Normandy, as foot passengers, then taking a train and staying in Rouen? It is a grand old city with stacks to do and see, capital of some wonderful countryside and villages easy to get to by bike, and a short train ride from Paris. Le Clos Jouvenet is a splendid country house within its own walled gardens and only 15 minutes&apos; walk from the centre of town (www.leclosjouvenet.com). It is elegantly uncomplicated, full of books and antiques and run by a charming pair of hosts. \u00a3180 for three nights&apos; B&amp;B. Tom Marchant: Barcelona and Madrid are fast being overtaken by Valencia as the city to visit in Spain. You get gorgeous beaches, plus the Valencian Institute of Modern Art, the Palace of the Borja and the Reina Sofia Palace of Arts. Stay in the Ad Hoc hotel in the historical Xerea quarter, which has a lively nightlife, history and a beach. With cheap flights it can fit David and Esther&apos;s budget, and will give them a flavour of the Latin culture that they can expect to see in Brazil. From \u00a3199pp for two nights, including flights and accommodation with breakfast from www.blacktomato.co.uk. &apos;I like luxury, he&apos;s not bothered&apos; Ruth and Richard Harmer live in Darlington and have been married for 33 years. Ruth, 56, is recently retired and Richard, 59, is the director of a vehicle hire business. The brief: &apos;When you&apos;ve been married for 33 years, your idea of romance is quite different from when you are young and you&apos;ve just got together. I don&apos;t think Richard has a romantic bone in his body, but I used to always bake him a heart-shaped cake for Valentine&apos;s Day, and I might do one again this year. We&apos;d also like to spend a weekend away, somewhere in the UK. At this time of year we like to go to the Lake District to do some walking. For me, that means a little potter round a lake, but Richard likes to go up enormous hills. Afterwards I&apos;d like to relax with a nice bath and some champagne, but he&apos;d just fall asleep. I&apos;d like to be in nice romantic surroundings, with candles and things, and I like luxury, but he&apos;s not bothered. We went to the Wordsworth Hotel in the Lake District once, which I really liked because they served nouvelle cuisine in nice small portions, but Richard can&apos;t stand that - he gets too hungry. He had to go out and buy some crisps afterwards.&apos; The budget: \u00a3300 The solution  Nikki Tinto: The Punch Bowl Inn, a 300-year-old pub which recently had a chic makeover, could be just what they are looking for. Located in Crossthwaite on the edge of the Lake District, it&apos;s cosy and comfortable; downstairs in the bar, real ales are served alongside champagne. The food is excellent and should satisfy both of their palates - hearty fare (toad-in-the-hole and beef stew with dumplings) for Richard, as well as posh nosh (seared scallops and seabass with lemongrass dressing) for Ruth. Double rooms from \u00a3290 for two nights, including full English breakfast and afternoon cream tea. Andrew Brownsrigg: Head for Dover, cross the channel with P&amp;O to Calais and a 38-mile drive will take you to the Ferme Auberge des Chartroux, an idyllic farmhouse hotel in a lovely rural setting just outside the village of Maresville. Enjoy delicious three-course set dinners with produce fresh from the farm. You can visit Boulogne, Montreuil, the battlefields of Agincourt and Crecy or just stroll along the cliffs between Cap Blanc Nez and Cap Gris Nez. A two-night, half-board package including ferry is \u00a3114 per person with Inntravel. Juliet Kinsman: Under 100 miles from Darlington, the Sallyport in Berwick-on-Tweed has all the requisites for a romantic escape: roaring fire, big baths with bath oil, champagne chilling. If Ruth wants Valentine&apos;s-themed decor, she&apos;ll love the heart-detailed Tiffany suite. They should take advantage of the ex-restaurateur owner&apos;s culinary skills, especially as there&apos;s a new dining room for the most intimate Provencal supper. Rooms cost \u00a390 to \u00a3140; dinner \u00a335 a head. The north-east coastline boasts the most romantic beaches for long walks: Holy Island, Bamburgh and Embleton beach are all nearby. Book through www.mrandmrssmith.com.  &apos;We haven&apos;t found time for a honeymoon yet&apos; Stephen Grindrod, 31, and his partner Phillip Roak, 37, have been together for two years and had a civil ceremony in December. They have just bought a flat in Borough, London. Phillip is president and CEO of his family business, a web technology consultancy; Stephen is its global website manager. The brief: &apos;We are quite romantic: in the past we&apos;ve hired a helicopter to take us to a secluded beach in the Whitsunday Islands in Australia for a romantic afternoon. We like to have a bit of pampering on holiday, and stay at top of the market, design spa hotels. We would like some exposure to regional culture and the gay night life if it is there. On a longer holiday, multiple destinations are advised to keep our attention, and we enjoy holidays with our friends, so it could be nice to have them meet us along the way for a leg of the journey. We&apos;d like to go for two-to-three weeks in September, probably to Thailand, but we are open to suggestions.&apos; The budget: Up to \u00a310,000, plus we have 600,000 air miles available. The solution Andrew Brownrigg: We suggest a four-centre holiday. Flying into Bangkok you will spend five nights at the wonderful Oriental hotel and spa. While in Bangkok you can have a full day&apos;s private sightseeing, visit bars, nightclubs and the famous Pat Phong night market. Then fly up to Chiang Mai and spend three nights at the Four Seasons Hotel. It has one of the world&apos;s most beautiful spas, and you could enjoy an elephant safari followed by a rafting expedition. From Chiang Mai you can spend two nights at the Four Seasons at Chiang Rai in the jungle, then five nights at the stylish Karma Samui, on Koh Samui, where friends can join you in a two-bedroom villa, with its own pool. All this would cost \u00a34,199 per person with Abercrombie &amp; Kent. With air miles you can fly first class for around 30,000 miles each, plus taxes, booking fees etc. Nikki Tinto: Bali is where two worlds collide: temples and legends with designer boutiques, mixologists and celebrity chefs. Stephen and Phillip could spend two weeks split between three destinations, starting at the Bale on the south coast, a hip hotel with private infinity pools, a holistic spa and a chef to prepare lobster barbecues in their own pavilion. They could then head inland to Ubud, Bali&apos;s cultural hub to spend a few nights at the ultra-stylish Uma Ubud. From here they would travel over the mountains to the unspoilt north coast and stay at one of Puri Ganesha&apos;s four very private beach villas. It is owned by quirky English interior designer, Diana von Cranach, who runs innovative raw food cookery courses and detox regimens. You can arrive by car, helicopter or Harley-Davidson. It costs \u00a36,260 including helicopter transfers. Flying Singapore Airlines you could use 93,000 air miles and stop for two nights at the New Majestic Hotel for \u00a3460. All booked via www.i-escape.com. &apos;We want to celebrate our anniversary&apos; Katharine Marr, 32, and Craig Smith, 32, run a translation company together and live in Northamptonshire. The brief: &apos;We met each other 10 years ago on Valentine&apos;s Day and got married last year, so we want to celebrate our anniversary by doing something special for Valentine&apos;s Day. We have been on romantic trips together in the past, including city breaks in boutique hotels and a trip to Austria. We love shopping at chic furniture shops and clothes boutiques, and we enjoy good food, cream teas and wine. We both like the outdoors and walks in the countryside and we&apos;d like to bring our cocker spaniel, Zippy. Our perfect holiday would be relaxed, staying in a cool, sexy hotel that isn&apos;t too pretentious. We would like to learn a new language and meet new people, so maybe eastern Europe with its magical castles, cooler weather (we don&apos;t like the sun) and diverse culture may be of interest.&apos; The budget: \u00a3800 for a weekend The solution  Alastair Sawday: Croatia could be just the country. Taking an overnight train to Venice on a Thursday might be a delightfully romantic way of making the journey special. They&apos;d have time for a ride on the Grand Canal before driving a hire car to the northern tip of Croatia, getting to Motovun in time for dinner. It is one of the prettiest towns in Croatia. Stay in an apartment in the Bella Vista, an old stone house run by Mirjana, a bubbly woman who might even take you truffle hunting with her hound. The local eating is superb and the views glorious. Andrew Brownrigg: Fly to Tallinn, the stunning capital of Estonia and spend two nights at the beautiful boutique design hotel, The Three Sisters, in the old town. A two night &apos;Lovers&apos; Escape&apos; in a junior suite includes breakfast , a three-course dinner with wine and a &apos;surprise&apos; for \u00a3610. You can enjoy some walks by the sea when not exploring the fascinating fairy-tale city&apos;s churches, castles, restaurants and shops. The hotel doesn&apos;t normally take pets, but they said they would make an exception if Zippy is clean and quiet! He must have his pet passport (it takes six months to obtain) and as long as he does not weigh more than 8kgs you can fly him with you in the cabin, in a container, on Estonian Airways as excess baggage at a cost of \u00a36 per kilo; your flights will cost \u00a3166 per person from Gatwick. Flights are available from Stansted on Easyjet for about \u00a393 per person, but Easyjet will not take pets. Tom Marchant: Reykjavik is a fantastic city combining stunning landscapes, exciting activities and cool urban chic. The chic Hotel 101 is one of the best modern hotels in the capital, and you can shop in the designer stores, journey out to the volcanoes and glaciers or swim in the famous thermal pools. And with the pet passport, Zippy can go with you. In the evening, try the city&apos;s cutting-edge nightlife.

At a storm-interrupted Malaysian Open he took a two-stroke lead with a five-under-par 67. At 18 years and 103 days tomorrow, he would surpass the long-standing record of Dale Hayes, who won the Spanish Open in 1971 at the age of 18 years and 290 days. Phadungsil is already the youngest-ever winner on the Asian Tour following his success in the 2005 Double A International Open in Bangkok. He carded seven birdies, including a 20-footer at the fourth hole, to move two shots clear of the Englishmen Simon Dyson and Marcus Higley and Finland&apos;s Marko Ilonen. Scotland&apos;s Clare Queen continued an impressive start to the season with a second successive 69 and a tie for ninth place at the halfway stage of the ANZ Australian Ladies&apos; Masters at the Royal Pines Resort on Queensland&apos;s Gold Coast. The 23-year-old stood on six under par and was the leading British player at six shots behind the 19-year-old South Korean leader, Sun Ju Ahn, who added a 68 to her opening 64.  Snooker Michaela Tabb will make history later this month by becoming the first woman to referee a major final at the Welsh Open in Newport.

Last month, she refereed Ding Jun Hui&apos;s 147 at the Wembley Masters, only the second ever compiled at the invitation event. &quot;When I first started in snooker I wasn&apos;t sure where it would take me or whether I would be accepted but with the support of World Snooker and the other referees I&apos;ve come a long way,&quot; said Tabb, a 39-year-old mother of two from Dunfermline, whose big day comes on February 18.

The view from the windows was of the twinkling lights of Bangkok and the majestic Chao Phraya river. The company was exclusive, as was the wine list. And the food, the food was quite literally the best money can buy. Wealthy gourmands from around the globe converged on a 65-storey luxury hotel in Thailand&apos;s capital last night to eat a unique &apos;millionaires&apos; dinner&apos; prepared by six Michelin three-star chefs flown in from Europe. The identity of those who spent one million Thai baht, more than \u00a316,000 a head, to enjoy the four-hour extravaganza of the finest ingredients and rarest wines was kept tightly under wraps. Staff at the 65th floor Mezzaluna restaurant at the lebua hotel had to hand in their camera mobile phones at the door to ensure secrecy for the diners, many of whom arrived in their private jets. The food had run up some eye-watering air miles too - beef was brought from Kobe, Japan, live lobsters journeyed from the north coast of France and the US state of Maine, oysters came from southern Australia, while white truffles came from Rome and black from Perigord in the Dordogne. From 35 cities around the world the finest ingredients were flown in at the last moment to ensure they would be in tip-top condition. In all the meal could not be declared eco-friendly. Yet the hotel that dreamed up the event with the hefty price tag - 17 per cent tip and Thai government taxes not included - maintained that the high-rollers were more than prepared to shell out for &apos;a unique experience&apos;. Among the mysterious foodies was a casino-owner from Macau, a Taiwanese hotel owner, and shipping and property tycoons from the US and Europe. Each chef selected their signature dishes for the ten-course meal. Guests were brought up in a private lift and led up the sweeping staircase, where British wine master Alun Griffiths introduced the wines, including a 1985 Romanee Conti, a 1959 Chateau Mouton Rothschild, a 1967 Chateau d&apos;Yquem and a 1961 Chateau Palmer, described by Griffiths as &apos;one of the greatest single wines of the 20th century&apos;. Each bottle travelled from the chateau of origin to the suppliers, Berry Brothers &amp; Rudd, of St James&apos;s in London and on to Bangkok. The wine for the meal alone cost \u00a3100,000. Even the palate-cleansing sorbet was crafted out of Dom Perignon champagne. But still, even for Alain Soliveres, of Paris&apos;s renowned Taillevent restaurant, who opened with creme brulee of foie gras with Tonga beans, the bill was breathtaking. &apos;It&apos;s surreal. The whole thing&apos;s surreal,&apos; he said. But, he added: &apos;To have brought together all of these three-star Michelin chefs and to serve these wines for so many people is an incredible feat.&apos; A select 15 paying guests enjoyed his mastery, along with that of the likes of Antoine Westermann, the chef-proprietor of Strasbourg&apos;s Buerehiesel, and the only woman, Annie Feolde, of Enoteca Pinchiorri, in Florence. Westermann, reeling from the price tag despite some of the profits going to charity, did his bit to make it value for money. He shaved 100g of rare Perigord truffles worth about \u00a3180 on to every diner&apos;s plate.

We take cheap flights to unpopular European destinations and stay in quirky B&amp;Bs. We have never booked a package holiday or stayed in an all-inclusive. As long as there&apos;s promise of pleasure, we&apos;ll try just about anything. Last year I was at a charity event when the fund-raising auction began and a five-star luxury cruise came under the hammer. My only previous cruising experience was over a decade ago. As a presenter for BBC2&apos;s Gaytime TV, I was sent to report on a lesbian Caribbean cruise, and by the end of our eight days on board, all 600 of us were strumming acoustic guitars. Even so, at the auction, I tipsily raised my hand one too many times. When I woke the next morning I had a throbbing headache and a crumpled credit-card receipt: Istanbul, Cyprus and nine Greek islands were calling us by name. We flew into Istanbul, and once on board the ship, cool towelettes were provided to mop our dusty brows and champagne poured to quench our throats, and our luggage miraculously appeared in our cabin. I only wish we had opted for the unpacking service as well.  Most would laugh at the suggestion of cruising. After all, reclining on pool-side sun loungers and occasionally strolling round glamorous port towns are hardly taxing holiday activities. Mornings were spent ordering cabin-service coffee and croissants, climbing back into bed and watching the on-board lectures on the ship&apos;s version of CCTV. We felt like rebelliously posh Asbo youth. The lectures, delivered by a smattering of Oxford dons, British Museum curators and Anglican bishops, ranged in topic from the iconoclastic controversy to monastic life in Meteora. The comparative artistic representation of Artemis and the Virgin Mary was my favourite; it certainly made a change from eating Cheerios and watching reruns of Bewitched. We docked in nearly a dozen ports in the space of a fortnight. Air-conditioned luxury coaches awaited every land-transport opportunity. Our on-shore cultural excursions were led by top-notch local guides, and with culture-laden destinations such as Thira, Heraklion and Rhodes, they helped us make the most of our few landlubbing hours. I doubt I&apos;d ever have visited Delos, a desolate island off Mykonos, without going on the cruise. Nobody lives there any more, but it&apos;s a living museum, with temples to Isis and Hera, and where Apollo was supposedly born. Our cruise had a distinctly intellectual bent, but all cruises are a way to indulge your interests, whether bird-watching, eating or frenetic dating. Cruising is life magnified, streamlined, with the irritating minutiae of airport queues and incomprehensible bus timetables eradicated. Each afternoon we returned to the ship and sat down to a proper afternoon tea, with endless pots of Earl Grey and cucumber sandwiches. The Strawberry Blonde and I managed to smuggle a big bottle of gin on board to mix our own preprandial cocktails, and a fresh ice bucket was delivered to our balconied cabin every evening - no questions asked.  Meal-times were perhaps the most challenging situation of all. The waiters attempted to place us at a large table full of couples; why should two ladies travelling together want to dine all on their lonesome? Initially, dressing for dinner I had the idea that cruise-ship dining ensembles needed feathers, fascinators and foot-long cigarette holders. Unfortunately I had to tone it down after the first night; most of our fellow cruisers had glad rags dating from the Thatcher years, and they weren&apos;t wearing those shoulder pads ironically.  We encountered some amazing people, especially the women. Many had careers in academia, medicine or law at a time when women in such professions were a rarity. All had lived through the war, and a few had extraordinary tales of survival. Some were just downright hilarious, like the 80-year-old from Bury flirting with a gentleman 20 years her junior in the hot tub; she was hard of hearing and shouted so loudly everyone on deck was involuntarily tuned in to her cheeky chat-up lines. &apos;Are you the cruise entertainment?&apos; was the most common question posed.

In theory, a holiday in the sun tans tired limbs and improves team bonding; alas, the practice is frequently different, with piss-ups turning to punch-ups, bonding being an angry headlock and bodies returning not so much golden brown as black and blue. Below we recall five of English clubs&apos; more troublesome trips abroad, in chronological disorder. 1. Niall Quinn&apos;s disco pants are a mess Peter Reid has had lots of bad ideas as a manager but his decision to take Manchester City on a pre-season trip to Italy in 1992 was one of the worst. On one drunken day, the players stumbled across an empty boxing ring and decided to stage their very own royal rumble. A few playful slaps were exchanged until beanpole striker Niall Quinn landed an unintentionally brutal one on midfield hardman Steve McMahon. The striker scarpered and forgot all about the incident until McMahon found him gyrating in a nightclub later that evening - and decked him. Fortified by rage and booze, Quinn chased his team-mate into the street, caught him and threw him through a shop window. Then scarpered again. The following morning, Reid summoned the pugilists and demanded to know what had happened: McMahon, who had no memory of the events, took full blame and paid for the broken window. 2. Stanley Collymore gets into another fine mess It&apos;s February 2000 and perennial bad boy Stanley Victor Collymore is enjoying something of a comeback under the gentle wing of Leicester manager Martin O&apos;Neill. Ten days after scoring a hat-trick on his Foxes debut, the striker is in high spirits on the team&apos;s mid-season jolly to the luxurious La Manga resort in Spain. As booze begins to flow, the team&apos;s behaviour becomes, in the words of resort manager Tony Coles, &quot;totally and utterly unacceptable&quot;, but Stan ensures his is the name that dominates the front-page headlines by taking a fire extinguisher and spraying it around the bar. The whole team is sent home early. Four years later Leicester return to La Manga without Collymore but are again sent home early - though three players are kept behind by the local police to face charges of sexual assault. The charges are subsequently dropped. 3. Arsenal v US Marines Arch-disciplinarian George Graham took his Arsenal troops on a break to Portugal in the middle of the 1986-87 season, unwittingly setting the scene for the Battle of the Birds. Six Gunners marched into a local nightclub and soon found themselves arguing over girls with a gang of US Marines. The footballers were chucked out but the soldiers followed them in a car, almost running them off the road. Enraged striker Charlie Nicholas hurled a bottle of vodka, which he happened to have on his person, at the car, smashing the windscreen and causing the Americans to career off the road. After fleeing back to the team hotel, the players were awoken the next morning by the local constabulary and, according to Perry Groves, the following message was sent to Graham, who was on the 17th tee of a nearby golf course: &quot;Mr Graham, half your team have been arrested for attempted murder.&quot; A panic-stricken Graham pegged it to the police station and, after negotiations, the Marines eventually settled for \u00a32,000. 4. Manchester City&apos;s Bangkok-up City went to Thailand in 2005 to play in a pre-season tournament and engage in some lucrative public relations with the growing Asian market. Upon returning from a restaurant in the early hours of a Friday morning, however, Joey Barton got a bit too hands-on with a wisecracking 15-year-old Everton fan; he then took a swipe at team captain and would-be peacekeeper Richard Dunne, who was so incensed that he kicked a wall in frustration and broke his toe. Barton was sent home in disgrace, Dunne hobbled home in plaster. 5. Dennis Wise Finnished at Leicester Whatever Leicester defender Callum Davidson was dreaming of as he slept in his room during his club&apos;s pre-season tour of Finland in September 2002, it can&apos;t have been as horrendous as the nightmare he awoke to: new team-mate Dennis Wise had broken into his room and punched him in the face, fracturing his jaw. Over a game of cards. Wise was sacked. Wise then sued for unfair dismissal but, like his Leeds team now, lost.", "publicationDate": "2007-02-19T14:10:51Z", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Craig Bellamy"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/feb/19/newsstory.sport6", "title": "Football: five infamous team-bonding exercises that went wrong", "sentences": ["Manchester City&apos;s Bangkok-up City went to Thailand in 2005 to play in a pre-season tournament and engage in some lucrative public relations with the growing Asian market."]}, {"article": "While the excitement, clamour and expectation will continue to grow as 19-year-old Andy Murray moves closer to the world&apos;s top 10, a place he may achieve by next month or early April, the young Scot knows well enough that his true merit will always be measured by the number of titles he wins - and major titles at that. Sunday night saw his successful defence of the SAP Open title in San Jose after a thrilling victory over the giant Croat Ivo Karlovic that was decided in a third-set tie-break. But, of the current top 10 players only Roger Federer (10), Rafael Nadal (2) and Andy Roddick (1) have won a grand slam title. Clearly this is a reflection of Federer&apos;s dominance over the last three years and Murray echoed the thoughts of every other player during this year&apos;s Australian Open when he said he hoped the departure of the world No1 would be &quot;pretty soon&quot;. This was, of course, meant to be flip. Federer is 25 and has stated his intentions of being around for the 2012 Olympic Games in London when the tennis will be on his beloved grass at Wimbledon. This week Federer equalled Jimmy Connors&apos; record of 160 consecutive weeks at No1 and he will make it his own next Monday. For the time being, except on clay, his dominance is absolute. Yet Murray has already beaten him, even though the Swiss was a good deal less than focused when the two met in the second round of the Cincinnati Masters last year. But what Murray&apos;s win proved was that he is capable of taking sharp advantage over any leading player whose game is a little off and this year, having worked assiduously on his fitness, he is more dangerous. It is accepted that Murray has one of the best defensive games on the circuit and now he is adding beef to his ground strokes and serve. He has lost only one three-set match this year, the final in Doha where he was beaten by Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia, the world No8. The only other player to have beaten him was Nadal in the fourth round of the Australian Open over five fluctuating sets. What singles Murray out among all the young hopefuls and the majority of those inside the top 20 is his variety. Television can do him an injustice, just as it used to with the bowling of Derek Underwood, the Kent and England spinner. Watching Underwood from side on was to marvel at the change of speed and trajectory and the same applies to Murray. Whereas many modern players, both men and women, stand at the back of the court and flail at the ball with no hint of subtlety or slice, the Scot is constantly mixing up play, getting his opponent both off balance and frustrated. And this is a joy. Murray&apos;s movement - one of Federer&apos;s more under-rated attributes - is also excellent, coupled with his ability to find exactly the right shot, pace and angle when he gets to the sort of ball that most other players would be happy enough merely to get back into play. &quot;I am one of the best movers on the court,&quot; he said after his victory in San Jose, achieved with a 6-7, 6-4, 7-6 scoreline. &quot;It&apos;s probably the best part of my game. When I get to the ball I can kind of manoeuvre shots when I&apos;m on the run. I pass well. There are obviously guys - like Nadal and [James] Blake - who would probably beat me in a straight-line sprint but my anticipation is very good, so I kind of make up for not being as quick as them.&quot; Karlovic, best known for defeating the then reigning Wimbledon champion, Lleyton Hewitt of Australia, in the first round of the 2003 championships, was quick to praise the teenager. &quot;He returns really well and is unbelievable from the baseline. Everything is very good.&quot; So how good? Good enough to win a grand slam title and maybe several, according to the game&apos;s best judges, for allied to his all-court game is his mental toughness and that is priceless. Murray has reached the final 16 in his last three major championships, while winning in San Jose for a second time underlined his ability to perform when the pressure is on. Because the rankings incorporate the last 12 months Murray remained at No13 after this win. But he has very few points to defend between now and Wimbledon and a great many to gain during the Masters series events, second only to the four majors, in Indian Wells, Key Biscayne, Monte Carlo, Rome and Hamburg, as well as at the French Open where he lost in the first round last year. &quot;I have more experience this year,&quot; Murray said. &quot;Last year I lost a lot of close matches and it&apos;s important to turn it around. That&apos;s the key - sticking in tough matches.&quot; A year ago, after winning his first ATP title in California, Murray struggled to lift himself again until Wimbledon. This time he is determined to push onwards and upwards. Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski reached a career high No4. Murray seems destined to do better. The last word goes to his American coach, Brad Gilbert. &quot;Andy has gained about 10 pounds, he&apos;s stronger, he&apos;s serving bigger and he&apos;s fitter. And he&apos;s got a great brain. He&apos;s 19 years old and he&apos;s going places.&quot; Family fortunes Jamie Murray, like his brother Andy, landed a title at the SAP Open in San Jose with a 7-5, 7-6 victory alongside his partner, Eric Butorac, in the doubles final. The Scot and his American partner beat the fourth seeds, Rainer Sch\u00fcttler and Chris Haggard, in one hour and 23 minutes. Murray and Butorac had to save two break points in the first set before they converted their only opportunity. In the second they squandered seven break points before coming through the tie-break 8-6. Where next?

Our reader reviewer of the week, John Howe, knows  A far cry from the streets of Bangkok ... Putahrasca&apos;s pools will ensure you unwind in no time Before I even arrived in Hua Hin, I received a very pleasant &apos;wake-up&apos; call from the Putahracsa Resort. The friendly voice told me that they were expecting me and wished me a safe journey. Cheerful, pleasant and polite, it set the tone for the weekend.  On arrival, I found Putahracsa Resort to be a place of peace and tranquility. A blend of modernity and tradition, it has been sensitively designed by Khun Vibon Techakalayatum, the interior designer husband of the Putahracsa&apos;s owner, Velvadi Sritrairatana.  I stayed in one of eight SanSky Villas with its own private swimming pool. The decor mixes minimalist concepts with the personal style of Vibon, a collector of antique Asian furniture. Each room has at least one piece from his own personal collection endowing it with individual charm and, where possible, all the wooden features are made from reclaimed and recycled materials. As you would expect of a five-star resort, all rooms and villas have a choice of king size or twin beds, international direct phone connections and a mini-bar. The 27-inch flat screen television rotates 360 degrees and, throughout the resort, free wireless internet access is available. No detail has been overlooked, with the natural-slate &apos;do not disturb&apos; notice fixed to a nail by a hemp cord enhancing the contemporary rustic feel. Wall length sliding windows allow natural light to permeate the space and provide a view of the swimming pool, lawns and some of the many mature frangipani trees and palms that adorn the resort. The windows give access to a private terrace, outdoor daybeds and a roof-top &apos;lounge&apos;, where you can sip a long drink and watch the setting sun cast lengthening shadows over the resort.  The resorts&apos; modern look is a reverential nod in the direction of the architectural oeuvre of Le Corbusier with its clean lines and lack of unnecessary ornamentation. Low-rise accommodation forms a horseshoe around a large swimming pool that is filled by a cascading waterfall, while the villas&apos; private pools are shielded from view by the use of plants and natural material screens - providing an ideal position to keep an eye on the kids. Over at the bamboo-roofed day spa, there is a range of comprehensive treatments available, including jetlag treatments. For me, there was nothing better after a long drive from Bangkok than to submit to the tender touch of an expert masseuse and an oil massage so calming that I had to be gently woken at the end of the session. Another treat was the stand-alone Nahb Talay restaurant, which is epicure heaven. The menu is extensive but will not strain the credit card. The most expensive main course is grilled rib-eye steak with gratin potatoes and grilled herbed tomatoes at 690 baht (\u00a310). The traditional Thai dish of raw prawns with spicy sauce was a treat of delicate spices gracing the firmly textured prawns. I can truly say that I have never tasted this dish that good.  Just three hours away from hot and muggy Bangkok, Putahracsa offers a perfect get away from the stress of work and strains of everyday life. If you have hankered for the combination of rustic charm with the convenience of modern living and the calmness of a tropical island, you won&apos;t do better than the Putahracsa Resort. \u2022 The author of this review also won a copy of the Alastair Sawday guide to British Hotels, Inns and Other Places.

The audience is made up of members of Bafta (the British Academy of Film and Television Arts). They&apos;ve just watched a screening of The Departed, Martin Scorsese&apos;s saga of Irish mafia and corrupt cops in Boston. Damon stars in the movie, alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Ray Winstone. King produced it. &apos;It was a tough shoot,&apos; chuckles King into his microphone. He has an English accent with a bit of an American twang. &apos;A few little movie stars in there ...&apos; Cast members repeatedly left the shoot to make or promote other movies; Wahlberg came back from another film set with a completely different haircut; Damon reports that Nicholson &apos;inserted layers of sexual obscenity&apos; into his character, psychopathic gang boss Frank Costello. In one scene he waggled a huge strap-on dildo in the face of Damon&apos;s character, bent policeman Colin Sullivan. King, to more laughter, adds that Warner Bros was concerned about Nicholson&apos;s sex-toy improv in their (hoped-for) blockbuster. They needn&apos;t have worried. In America The Departed - a remake of Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs - has been Scorsese&apos;s highest-grossing film to date. It&apos;s won a Best Director Golden Globe for Scorsese and, at tonight&apos;s Oscar ceremony, is in the running in five categories. But in this awards season, there&apos;s always more campaigning to be done. Which is why Damon and King have flown into Britain. &apos;That&apos;s what it&apos;s like these days,&apos; King says dryly. &apos;Gotta do the dog and pony show.&apos; Who is Graham King? &apos;I&apos;m a film producer. How do you define a film producer? Wow ... my job is to find screenplays, books, articles, and develop those into shooting scripts. Hire the actors, the director - sometimes even finance the movies.&apos; He&apos;s involved all the way through overseeing the day-to-day running of the shoot of the film, overseeing the post-production, the release of the movie, the marketing campaigns, trailers. &apos;And trying to get the talent to do publicity, which is never easy. So really my job is, from start to finish - everything.&apos; King is the 45-year-old son of a hairdresser and a cabbie from Cockfosters, at the northern end of the Piccadilly line. He&apos;s the founder of the Initial Entertainment Group, a Los Angeles-based production company. IEG is a small outfit, employing 15 people. But by the CEO&apos;s estimation they&apos;ve garnered 38 Oscar nominations in four years. Having previously set up Leonardo DiCpario&apos;s production company, Appian Way, King has also formed another with Johnny Depp, called Infinitum Nihil. &apos;Graham&apos;s got terrific taste,&apos; says Matt Damon. &apos;He&apos;s always trying to line himself up with people that he thinks are good. And he&apos;s producing good movies because of it. On The Departed, he was there on set every day. Nobody is overbearing on one of Marty&apos;s [Scorsese] sets. It&apos;s very clear that we&apos;re all there working for Marty. It&apos;s a very deferential environment. But Graham&apos;s done so many things with Marty now that he definitely has his ear, so if he has a suggestion, he&apos;s not shy about giving it.&apos; Scorsese says that King is different from other producers, insofar as his presence during filming is less about keeping a fidgety, money man&apos;s eye on budgets and schedules. &apos;I find him a comforting figure on the set,&apos; says the director. &apos;Unlike some people in the past, who were alarming.&apos; It was King who raised the money to enable Scorsese to make his long-cherished Gangs of New York, who financed DiCaprio&apos;s own pet project, the Howard Hughes biopic The Aviator, and who helped get Scorsese on board to direct after Michael Mann bailed out (the Miami Vice director didn&apos;t fancy another biopic after Ali - also a King movie). It was King who rescued Steven Soderbergh&apos;s Traffic after Harrison Ford pulled out, and who helped DiCaprio move beyond his Titanic-era dreamboat status to become one of the greatest movie stars of the times. Rick Yorn, DiCaprio&apos;s agent, describes King as &apos;like a modern-day Selznick&apos;. That&apos;s David O Selznick, who produced Gone with the Wind. DiCaprio is brilliant as an undercover cop in The Departed. He&apos;s equally believable in recent release Blood Diamond, in which he plays a Zimbabwean ex-mercenary on the trail of a fabulous pink diamond in war-torn Sierra Leone. (King was a producer on that $100m movie, too.) DiCaprio is nominated for the Best Actor for Blood Diamond at the Oscars, one of five awards the film is up for; but tonight&apos;s ceremony in Los Angeles is more about King&apos;s other key partnership, with Martin Scorsese. Ladbrokes has made Scorsese and The Departed favourites to win Best Director and Best Picture. Scorsese has, incredibly, never won an Oscar, despite being nominated five times before this year. If he finally triumphs tonight, it will be as much of an achievement for his producer. That&apos;s Graham King, the most powerful Brit in Hollywood. I meet King a few hours before the Matt and Graham roadshow at the Odeon. He&apos;s tired, he says. Too much jet-setting. &apos;I&apos;ve taken three red-eyes in the last five days.&apos; He was in Maui, Hawaii for Thanksgiving. Then back to LA. A stopover in New York. And now London, for the Bafta engagement &apos;and meetings with directors and bits and pieces&apos;. He&apos;s a big, broad guy, dressed in smart-casual black. A resident of Malibu, he has the Californian colouring and the confident air of a man who has been working in Hollywood for 25 years. He possesses the staccato spiel of a seasoned salesman. He started out in a lowly job in international sales at Fox television, when the company flogged shows such as Starsky and Hutch, M*A*S*H and Dynasty all round the world. Bullet-points and statements, rather than sentences, are spat out. But he still talks like a geezer: he says &apos;we wasn&apos;t&apos; instead of &apos;we were not&apos;, and mentions his football team, Chelsea, whenever he can. King grew up loving films. He&apos;d go to the Saturday morning picture clubs at the Odeon Southgate and the Gaumont Finchley in north London. On leaving school he considered going to college to study economics and computer science. But in 1981, when he was 19, he followed his mum out to LA. She had sold her hairdressing businesses and emigrated after splitting with his dad. Britain was grey and depressing then. &apos;But in California the weather was beautiful, there were nice girls on the beach. They loved the English accent. And everything was cheap.&apos; He enrolled at UCLA, taking the subjects he&apos;d planned to study in Britain. But after a few months he landed a three-week temping job at Fox, working in the international television distribution department, dispatching copies of shows to buyers abroad. &apos;I loved being on the lot,&apos; he says, almost wistfully. His office was right off Dolly Street, where they&apos;d filmed Hello Dolly! &apos;It was a lot of fun. They were shooting Moonlighting at the time, with Bruce Willis. Stuff like that. The atmosphere was great.&apos; Already King was thinking that he&apos;d found his calling. &apos;I loved the business, the industry, I loved Hollywood.&apos; One day, Bill Saunders, Fox&apos;s president of international TV sales, ponced a cigarette off a kid in the temping pool. &apos;All right, take one,&apos; replied King. &apos;I&apos;m sure you can afford &apos;em more than I can, but take one.&apos; Saunders, another Englishman, who had worked his way up from the postroom at Fox in London, noticed the youngster&apos;s accent, and his pluck. The next day he called King to his office and offered him a permanent job. He stayed for seven years, mentored by Saunders, learning the art of selling. Saunders was a master - when the Japanese visited, he would come into the office wearing a kimono. &apos;It&apos;s Hollywood!&apos; he would tell his young protege. &apos;Don&apos;t take this too seriously!&apos; But with Saunders due to retire, King wanted to move on, too. By now Rupert Murdoch had acquired Fox. &apos;The whole studio had changed. It was more like, &quot;What&apos;s the demographic of the cable TV market in Poland?&quot; As opposed to, &quot;Let&apos;s go and sell some movies.&quot;&apos; Displaying the chutzpah that had taken him to LA in the first place, King decided to escape the corporate world. &apos;I didn&apos;t want to be a guy that had a family, got to his mid-forties and was in the old stable, kicked out in his fifties. Then you&apos;ve got nowhere to go. To me, it was always about controlling my own destiny, no matter what I did. And I was always entrepreneurial. So I left Fox and worked for a few independents. Got a rude awakening to the reality of the indie business. Again, doing sales but getting more involved in the production side.&apos; Now, King is renowned in Hollywood for his ability to come up with fantastical sums of money to make punishingly expensive movies, by pre-selling films to distributors on the strength of their scripts alone. Things started with a bang in 1999 when Scorsese couldn&apos;t find a backer for his Gangs of New York script - &apos;because,&apos; says King, &apos;the studios were looking at a budget of around $90m, $95m. And a period piece which, with Marty, usually means a 2hr 40 minute movie.&apos; An agent from the ICM talent agency asked King if he&apos;d like to be in business with Scorsese and DiCaprio. King, a boxing fan as well as a film fanatic, had loved Raging Bull and Taxi Driver. Of course he&apos;d like to work with the guy who made them. The same day King received the Gangs script. He loved it. The next day he had a meeting with Scorsese. &apos;I went to the Bel-Air Hotel in Beverly Hills,&apos; he recalls. &apos;Driving there I was so nervous. I&apos;m about to meet this guy who&apos;s been my idol for years. I knocked on the door and there he was, full of life and full of energy, just who Marty is. And he had books open all over his room, and he was looking up history on the time of Gangs of New York. I was very intimidated, very intimidated. But to him, I was his knight in shining armour. I&apos;d come along and put the money up and made his movie go.&apos; King fronted $65m. But Gangs of New York became an infamously tortuous shoot, taking three years to make. In that period King also greenlit Ali and Traffic - he had become friends and shared an office with Catherine Zeta-Jones, in part through expat kinship, after the Welsh actress relocated to LA. The Hollywood trade press dubbed him the Suicide King, convinced that he could wave bye-bye to the money he was throwing about. &apos;A lot of the press were saying, &quot;He&apos;s gonna lose his shirt,&quot;&apos; King says. &apos;But before Gangs even went in production I was 90 per cent recouped on my investment, just from deals I&apos;d done with distributors round the world. They&apos;d pre-bought it based on the script.&apos; Traffic was a financial and artistic triumph - King savvily held off selling it until the drugs drama had won four Oscars. But he did lose money on Ali. He thinks the movie failed because it was too long; the public weren&apos;t ready to buy Will Smith as living legend Muhammad Ali (although he was Oscar-nominated for the role); and, he admits, because he made the film for the wrong reasons. &apos;I don&apos;t usually get driven by ego. That&apos;s one thing you have to be very careful of. I guess I did that a little bit with Ali: I was a huge boxing fan growing up. My dad used to take me to Tottenham Court Road to watch the Ali fights live. Ali-Frazer in the movie theatre, live by satellite, in the days when we had three TV channels.&apos; Instead, he&apos;s driven by passion, and his partners reciprocate his enthusiasm. Jodie Foster, who made The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys with King - she starred in and produced the film - describes him as &apos;the superman who came in and said, &quot;I love you, here&apos;s the money.&quot;&apos; Does King think his outsider status helped him in Hollywood - is he better able to think the unthinkable by dint of having grown up a world away from the hermetic, self-perpetuating world of Hollywood? &apos;Definitely. Feet on the ground, down to earth, no ego... When I read a script, no matter who the star or filmmaker is, I&apos;m driven by (a) how much is it gonna cost, (b) how emotional I feel creatively about it, and (c) if I think an audience will go and see the movie. It&apos;s not because Johnny Depp wants to do a film. I&apos;ve never been that way.&apos; This means that even stellar projects have to be let go sometimes. King and IEG were due to bankroll Robert De Niro&apos;s The Good Shepherd, an epic telling of the birth of the CIA. King &apos;loves Bob and loved the screenplay&apos;. But he envisioned it &apos;getting a little bit out of hand&apos;. He couldn&apos;t risk being the man responsible for an already expensive film going over-budget. Anyway, King has plenty more on his plate. He and Depp will start shooting the Indian-set drugs&apos;n&apos;criminals epic Shantaram later this year. He&apos;s in post-production on two Nicolas Cage actioners, Next and Bangkok Dangerous. He&apos;s working on an American gangster film with Fatal Attraction director Adrian Lyne. He&apos;s long wanted to make a film in Britain but is frustrated by the parochial attitude here. &apos;British movies very rarely see the light of day outside of the UK. We have the best talent in the world. Why can&apos;t we make great movies for a worldwide audience? Why can&apos;t we develop? That&apos;s where people in the UK get scared, developing. Spending a lot of money. Development is a very risky business.&apos; But King is putting his money where his mouth is and, finally, making a British film. He talks of a &apos;fabulous&apos; script he is developing with Oscar-winning writer-actor-director Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park). He couldn&apos;t go into much detail but said that it was about the young Queen Victoria. It was announced last month that the project was definitely going ahead. According to the Hollywood Reporter, King had been introduced to the subject of Queen Victoria by his friend Sarah, Duchess of York, who has written two books on the monarch. &apos;Graham is a very interesting combination,&apos; Fellowes says. &apos;He is so powerful that he has no need to demonstrate it. He&apos;s a good delegator - having invited me to write a first draft he let me go away and do it. And he&apos;s not a fiddler,&apos; Fellowes adds. &apos;I can&apos;t tell you how welcome that is for a writer. I meet Hollywood people all the time, and what made an impression is that he is such a courteous man. That was such a refreshing change. Half the time in Hollywood, setting up a picture is like being on the set of Apocalypto.&apos; King&apos;s top-to-bottom understanding of his projects is evident, Fellowes thinks, in his choice of director for The Young Victoria: a young French-Canadian director named Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e. &apos;That&apos;s very creative, a lateral-thinking appointment of a brilliant filmmaker. He&apos;s one of those giant Hollywood people who can start a project just by being interested in it. So it seems to me extremely good news for Britain that he&apos;s interested in making a film here.&apos; For all the excitement of a homecoming, the thing that weighs most on King&apos;s mind right now is the Oscars. In 2005 he won the Best Picture Bafta and Golden Globe for The Aviator, but Scorsese missed out on Best Director. &apos;I&apos;d never won anything in my life other than on a lottery ticket. So there I am, up on stage - and Marty wasn&apos;t winning. That was a really hard pill for me to swallow.&apos; At the subsequent Oscars, despite heavy pre-ceremony heat, The Aviator only won five of the &apos;smaller&apos; statues. What are the Hollywood whispers on The Departed&apos;s chances this year? &apos;I just want it for Marty,&apos; King says with feeling. &apos;I&apos;ve got a few years ahead of me to win the big one. I would just love to see Marty finally honoured at the Academy.&apos; And King has other dreams for perhaps the greatest living director. &apos;I would love to make a movie that Marty would star in. He&apos;s been in movies, and he did the voice in Shark Tale. But I think he&apos;s just a personality all of his own. When you travel with him he gets so much recognition everywhere he goes. He&apos;s bigger than the movie stars sometimes!&apos; If anyone could make that happen, it&apos;s Graham King from Cockfosters.", "publicationDate": "2007-02-25T07:36:41Z", "tags": ["Film", "Awards and prizes", "Oscars", "Oscars 2007", "Culture", "Life and style", "Crime", "The Departed"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/feb/25/awardsandprizes.oscars", "title": "Meet the biggest Brit in Hollywood ...", "sentences": ["He&apos;s in post-production on two Nicolas Cage actioners, Next and Bangkok Dangerous."]}, {"article": "This article was amended on Wednesday February 28 2007.  We should clarify that the Stir-fried Morning Glory recipe featured below uses an edible member of the morning glory family Ipomoea aquatica, found in south-east Asia and known as water spinach. This should not to be confused with the UK Ipomoea, also known as morning glory, which can be poisonous. Fairly easy Chicken curry This hails from Chiang Mai and reflects the cuisine of Burma, Thailand&apos;s north-western neighbour. It is also used as the template for many Malaysian and Singaporean spicy noodle dishes. It is usually served with a garnish of salted vegetables but this is, understandably, an acquired taste. Serves 4 450g skinless chicken breasts 400g fresh egg noodles 2 tbs vegetable oil 2 cloves garlic, crushed 2 tbs red curry paste 1 litre coconut milk 2 tbs fish sauce 1 chicken stock cube, crumbled 2 tbs lime juice 1 tsp sugar fried shallots and fresh coriander, to garnish Slice the chicken into strips. Blanch the noodles in boiling water for a minute then drain. Heat the oil in a wok or frying pan and stir-fry the garlic for 1 minute until light brown. Add the curry paste and stir- fry for 2 minutes over a low heat. Add the coconut milk, fish sauce, stock cube, lime juice and sugar, stir well, and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat, add the chicken and simmer over a medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Divide the noodles between four bowls, top with curry and garnish with the shallots and coriander. Easy Coriander and garlic marinaded chicken This is a signature dish of many Thai restaurants but there are numerous regional variations. The Thai penchant for using fresh coriander, roots and all, is simple culinary ingenuity. Serves 4 4 chicken legs on the bone 4 cloves garlic, peeled 2 tbs fresh coriander, roots and all 1 tbs fish sauce 2 tbs lime juice 1 tbs palm sugar 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper diced cucumber and mango, to serve Make deep slits along the thickest part of each chicken leg. Pound the garlic and coriander using a pestle and mortar until finely minced and mix with the fish sauce, lime juice, palm sugar and pepper. Put the chicken in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over. Marinate the chicken for at least 30 minutes. For best results, barbecue the chicken for about 20-30 minutes, turning occasionally, until cooked through. Alternatively, put the chicken on a rack and cook under a medium grill for about 20-25 minutes, turning once or twice and basting occasionally with a little of the marinade, until cooked through. Serve the chicken hot with the diced cucumber and mango. Very easy Steamed mussels with karachai This version of steamed mussels is infused with lesser ginger, or krachai, and black pepper. Throw table manners to the wind and dig in with your fingers; it&apos;s the only way to enjoy mussels. Serves 4 2kg fresh mussels 2 tbs fresh coriander, roots and stems 4 tbs vegetable oil 1 tbs shredded lesser ginger (krachai) 1 tbs crushed garlic 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper juice of 2 limes 2 tbs fish sauce 100ml Chinese wine or dry sherry large bunch of Thai sweet basil leaves Scrub the mussels well under cold running water, discarding any broken or open shells. Grind the coriander roots and stems using a pestle and mortar or a coffee grinder. Heat the oil in a wok or frying pan and stir-fry the lesser ginger and garlic for one minute then add the coriander. Stir-fry for one minute. Place a plate or dish in the bottom of a large steamer. Put the mussels in the steamer and sprinkle the fried ingredients over. Add the black pepper, lime juice, fish sauce and wine and toss the mussels well. Cover and steam for 6-8 minutes. Or cook in a large saucepan covered with a lid, shaking occasionally. Transfer the mussels and any juices to a large bowl, discarding any unopened shells. Serve the mussels garnished with whole and chopped basil leaves. Easy Tenderstem Broccoli with Oyster Sauce and mushrooms This is a real jewel of a dish: a crunchy, spicy compendium of different vegetables in a peppery sauce. A Chinese-influenced dish, it is traditionally made using the popular Chinese vegetable kai lan, although tender stem broccoli makes an excellent alternative and comes closest in flavour. (To keep the broccoli crisp and retain its colour, blanch it first in boiling water for 30 seconds, drain and refresh under cold water before stir-frying.) Serves 4 2 tbs vegetable oil 1 tbs chopped garlic 1 tbs shredded ginger 300g tender stem broccoli 6 fresh field mushrooms, stalks trimmed 2 tbs Chinese wine or dry sherry 2 tbs oyster sauce 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper 2 tbs water Cut the broccoli into 5cm lengths, wash and drain. Heat the oil in a wok or pan and stir-fry the garlic and ginger for one minute. Toss in the broccoli and mushrooms and stir-fry for one minute. Add the wine, oyster sauce, black pepper and water and continue to stir-fry for 2 minutes. Serve immediately. Easy Stir-fried vegetables This recipe can be adapted to suit most vegetables. If the vegetables are blanched before stir-frying, there is no need to add extra water. Serves 4 90g tender stem broccoli or kai lan 90g cauliflower florets 1 carrot 10 fresh field mushrooms 12 mangetout 3 tbs vegetable oil 1 tbs crushed garlic 1 tbs sesame oil 1 tbs fish sauce 1 tbs oyster sauce 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper 1/2 tsp sugar Cut the broccoli and cauliflower into bite-sized pieces. Slice the carrot into rounds and halve the mushrooms. Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil and blanch all the vegetables for 1 minute then drain well and refresh under cold running water. Heat the oil in a wok or frying pan and stir-fry the garlic until light brown. Add all the vegetables and stir-fry over a high heat for 1 minute. Add the sesame oil, fish sauce, oyster sauce, pepper and sugar and stir-fry for a further 30 seconds until combined. Serve immediately. Easy Stir-fried morning glory or spinach Morning glory is a vegetable indigenous to most of Southeast Asia, and in Thailand it grows vigorously. Also known as water convolvulus and water spinach, it is rich in nutrients and crisp and crunchy when stir-fried. Spinach makes a decent substitute. [Please note: the plant known as morning glory in the British Isles is toxic, so make sure you use the South East Asian plant] Serves 4 200g morning glory/spinach 2 tbs vegetable oil 2 cloves garlic, sliced 1 tbs red or yellow curry paste 1 tsp sugar 100ml water Slice the stalks of the morning glory or spinach into 5cm pieces and shred the leaves roughly. Wash and drain thoroughly. Heat the oil in a wok and stir-fry the garlic for 1 minute until light brown then add the curry paste and sugar. Fry for another minute then add the morning glory/spinach and water. Cover the wok and cook over a high heat until the leaves are tender, about 3 minutes. Easy Mixed vegetable curry This version of gaeng nopakkao comes from Thai chef supremo Tym Srisawatt, who has won many awards for her vegetarian dishes. You could substitute seasonal vegetables. Serve with sticky rice. Serves 4 150g savoy or green cabbage 1 carrot 4 small Thai aubergines 2 tbs vegetable oil 2 tbs yellow curry paste 250ml coconut milk 1 tbs fish sauce 1 tbs palm sugar 3 tbs coconut cream used to serve (optional) Roughly chop the savoy cabbage, thickly slice the carrot and quarter the aubergines. Wash and pat dry the vegetables. Heat the oil in a wok or frying pan and stir-fry the yellow curry paste for one minute. Add the coconut milk and gradually bring to the boil. Add all the vegetables, fish sauce and palm sugar. Reduce the heat and simmer for eight minutes, stirring occasionally until the vegetables are tender. Drizzle the coconut cream over, if using. Fairly easy Crispy noodles Practically a national dish in Thailand, where each village or region has its own variation, this recipe comes from Bangkok and typifies the cooking of the south of the country. Serves 4 vegetable oil, for deep-frying 300g dried rice vermicelli 2 tbs chopped garlic 150g white crab meat 250g peeled raw prawns 3 spring onions, cut into thin lengths 2 tbs chilli paste 2 tbs fish sauce 2 tbs lime juice 1 tsp sugar 200g beansprouts Heat enough oil in a large wok or saucepan to deep-fry the vermicelli then fry a few handfuls at a time until they puff up and turn a pale golden colour. When cooked, drain on kitchen paper and set aside. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the oil and fry the garlic until it&apos;s light brown. Add the crab meat, prawns and spring onions and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the chilli paste, fish sauce, lime juice and sugar then stir. Add the crisp vermicelli and toss gently. Turn off the heat and toss in the beansprouts (they should be practically raw). Otherwise known as glutinous rice in some Southeast Asian countries, this staple is at the heart of a Thai meal, and makes a perfect foil for spicy dishes, particularly curries. Easy Sticky rice For the best results, soak the rice for several hours, or even overnight, before steaming. Serves 4 300g sticky rice 1/2 tsp salt Put the rice in a large bowl with the salt. Fill the bowl with cold water so that it covers the rice by about 2.5cm and leave. After several hours, the rice will have soaked up most of the water. Drain, then transfer to a steamer. Steam the rice for 25 minutes until tender. Be sure to serve this immediately. \u00b7 From Real Thai by Terry Tan (Jacqui Small, \u00a38.99).

Then, airlines paid handsomely for their services, with a standard commission of 9 per cent for international flights and 7 per cent for domestic. Booking a business-class return to Bangkok, for example, could net several hundred pounds&apos; commission for just 15 minutes work. But the budget carriers started selling direct through call centres, then the internet, and the big boys followed suit. As airlines became less reliant on agents, they slashed commissions. Today, there is a huge variation, so your choice of airline can have a big impact on how much the agent makes. For selling an American Airlines ticket to New York, for example, the agent will receive no commission. Persuade you to go for Eos, and they will get 10 per cent.

Hot chocolate, Taittinger and flat beds are mine to enjoy once more. Indeed this latest missive comes to you from seat 1A of a Boeing 777 to Boston \u2013 a marvellous flight with a, charming destination. A day of ruthless negotiation in the city will be tempered by a weekend of sophisticated relaxation in the Berkshires, courtesy of the outstanding Wheatleigh hotel. What greater pleasure than BlackBerry-fiddling during a Swedish massage? Speaking of pleasure, the highlight of a remarkable fortnight was irrefutably New York. Granted, the 8am BA172 back to Heathrow was a touch masochistic after a night of kamikaze drinking at Marquee. But all in all it was, as always, an utter delight. The secret to New York is its hotels and one in particular: the Mercer Hotel. A magnificent project by that most magnificent of hoteliers, Andre Balazs. An outstanding hotel can make all the difference, particularly to the business traveller. We spend our entire lives in their confines, so a brilliant hotel is as important as a flawless laptop or a productive team. But what makes for a stellar hotel? Well, it&apos;s a curious mix of the tangible and the intangible. Most decent hotels these days have a bewildering array of facilities. But once you&apos;ve reached a certain standard, their contribution becomes nigh-on irrelevant. What really matters is its style, its design philosophy. I may pride myself on being a maximalist, but when it comes to hotels I am a staunch minimalist. The rooms should be uncluttered, the furniture plain-coloured (preferably browns and blacks), the floors wooden or cream and the lighting multi-coloured but dim. Then, while conforming with these basic principles, there has to be something distinctive and noteworthy (though not try-hard) about the design. Neither the identikit &quot;business&quot; chains nor the chandelier-laden &quot;luxury&quot; hotels will ever fascinate or excite you. You&apos;ll feel like just another business traveller on yet another dull and tired trip. But minimalism need not mean a lack of warmth. To keep returning to the same establishment, sharp lines and aesthetic pleasure can&apos;t be enough. You need to feel recognised, wanted - even loved. Every travel writer and his dog have talked about the basics of hotel service \u2013 timeliness, efficiency and so on. I&apos;m talking about something different: a personal relationship. &quot;Mr Levene&quot; is not enough; it should be &quot;Max&quot;. Receiving an iron when you ask for it is not enough; it should be waiting in your room when you arrive. And I don&apos;t want any suite; I want my suite, the one which feels like home. A hotel-client relationship becomes a close friendship when you both recognise what a luxury the other is. And finally, a truly brilliant hotel needs a brilliant centrepiece; an unmistakable, outstanding feature that defines its space. You&apos;ll remember it, crave to see it and talk about it with all your friends: business travel will never feel staid again. I notice that hotels in the Americas are spectacularly effective in this regard. The Mercer has its super-hip lobby crammed full of New York&apos;s premier fashionistas. The Setai (Miami) has its Asian-themed courtyard, adorned by Buddha, rich foliage and soothing water. And Carlisle Bay (Antigua) has a library that will make you want to become a librarian. It&apos;s all about being somewhere unique; feeling special. Here are five of my favourite city hotels to refresh your business travels: 1. The Mercer Hotel, New York Beautiful and loveable with the best service in the world. If you can, book a Loft Studio, room 507 is especially brilliant.2. Park Hyatt, TokyoStunning and a must for lovers of Lost In Translation. Has the ultimate city spa. Book a Park Suite for superlative comfort.3. Widder Hotel, ZurichEight immaculately restored townhouses meshed together to feel like home. Extraordinary.4. Sukhothai, BangkokYou&apos;re in one of the busiest cities in the world but you&apos;ll feel like you&apos;re on a beach. Try to bag a one-bedroom apartment.5.

The court was told that he made a statement that he was provoked into killing his wife when he found her with the bodies of the children at their home in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, in July 2006, and believed that she had murdered them. A distressed woman member of the jury at Manchester crown court wept as Paul Reid QC, prosecuting, gave details of the repeated blows suffered by the family. On the advice of the judge, Mr Reid moved on to a more general account of the injuries. Mr Arshad sat impassively in the dock as he listened to Mr Reid&apos;s account of the head wounds and of how the bodies were found by three police officers who broke into the house after a neighbour reported smelling decaying flesh and seeing a large number of bluebottles inside. The jury heard that not long before she died, Uzma had told her brother: &quot;Count the days until he [Arshad] kills me.&quot; Mr Reid said Uzma and the children were killed late on July 28 or early on July 29. On July 28, Mr Arshad told the same brother of the \u00a330,000 BMW he claimed to have bought as an early birthday present for his wife. He then added: &quot;Well just wait - there will be a much bigger surprise.&quot; Mr Reid said Mr Arshad and his wife, who were cousins, had an arranged marriage in 1992. Mr Arshad, described as &quot;jealous and possessive&quot;, later began to believe his wife, who liked western fashions, was having an affair. After a separation, they began living together again at the Cheadle Hulme house in May 2006. The jury heard that Mr Arshad booked his flight from Manchester to Bangkok on July 11, originally for travel on July 31. He later transferred the booking to a July 29 flight from Heathrow. In the days before the killings, he showered his wife with presents, including jewellery, a TV and the BMW, and told his family he had booked a holiday for them in Dubai. He said Mr Arshad bought the rounders bat on July 27 and on the following day took some or all of the family to Blackpool. &quot;Wristbands were issued to at least two of the children at Blackpool Pleasure Beach,&quot; said Mr Reid. &quot;The wrist bands were still being worn by Henna and Abbas when their bodies were discovered.&quot; The children were found in the lounge. Adam, wearing an England football shirt, and Abbas were both covered by sheets and Henna by a pink duvet cover: her head was resting on a cushion and covered by another. Uzma&apos;s body, covered by a towel, was on a bed upstairs. There were 23 lacerations to her head. The court heard that at about 7am, a motorway camera recorded the BMW heading south. The car was parked in the short-stay car park at Heathrow at 10am and Mr Arshad checked in for his flight 10 minutes later. When police examined the car, they found in the boot swimming costumes and buckets and spades presumed to have been taken to Blackpool. Mr Arshad&apos;s clothing, searched when he returned from Thailand, included blood-stained trainers, sandals, shorts and a T-shirt.

But Tuesday&apos;s blood bath on the world&apos;s stock markets turned that truism on its head. The rout started in Shanghai. The Chinese are just getting a taste of stock market buying and selling and, like other stock markets such as Bangkok and Mumbai, there has been a long, strong upward trend. China has accumulated huge foreign exchange reserves and a lot of those dollars, if not spent abroad, seep into the domestic money supply, which, in turn, makes credit cheap. The Chinese authorities are nervous about a likely bubble and tried to make noises that they may tax capital gains of the traders. This caused panic in Shanghai. But the spread of that panic has to do with other events which are related. Japan has run a very lax monetary policy as it has struggled to come out of a ten year-long recession. It also has large dollar reserves, which it is happy to pump into domestic credit. In the old days (the sixties and seventies), each money market was insulated from others, and low rates here did not matter for the borrowers there. With globalisation, the barriers between the markets are much lower, and money can be borrowed here where it is cheap and spent there where returns are higher. The Japanese Central Bank just recently nudged interest rates from 0.25 % to 0.5 %. This may not sound much, but in these speculative markets, volumes are large but returns are wafer-thin. A quarter-point increase in interest rates, if followed through by another rise later or appreciation of yen against the dollar, would mean that a profitable transaction can turn into a loss-making one. There has been excess liquidity in the world&apos;s markets for some time now. The US trade deficit has ended up as surpluses held by China, Japan, Germany and many others. But cheap as the money is, there has been a feeling that, sooner or later, the liquidity may dry up or that policy-makers will tighten policy if inflation threatens to go up. Then, two days ago, Alan Greenspan, who just recently retired as Fed chairman and has the reputation of a Delphic oracle, said there is a recession likely round the corner. This was the real straw that broke the camel&apos;s back. Add to that fears over Iran and US confrontation, and you see the scenario. But the players in these markets are grown-up and rich, and deserve no sympathy. The only danger to ordinary citizens will be if the stock market fall does not reverse itself within three or four days, and begins to affect growth. In that case, a worldwide recession will be difficult to avoid. Just when you thought globalisation had eliminated the old business cycle, it is back at your doorstep - thanks to the Shanghai stock market.", "publicationDate": "2007-02-28T17:00:00Z", "tags": ["China", "Business", "Japan", "US news", "Economics", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/28/shanghaied", "title": "Shanghaied!", "sentences": ["The Chinese are just getting a taste of stock market buying and selling and, like other stock markets such as Bangkok and Mumbai, there has been a long, strong upward trend."]}, {"article": "20 new species of sharks and rays found at markets Twenty new species of sharks and rays have been discovered in Indonesia during a survey of catches at local fish markets, Australian researchers said yesterday.

The large-billed reed warbler, described by the charity Birdlife International as &quot;the world&apos;s least-known bird&quot;, was first discovered in India in 1867 when a single specimen was collected in the Sutlej valley. When no other examples were found, some scientists questioned whether it was a new species or an aberrant individual of another kind of species.  Then in March last year, ornithologist Philip Round found a live large-billed reed warbler while banding wild birds at a waste water treatment centre near Bangkok. He said: &quot;Although reed warblers are generally drab and look very similar, one of the birds I caught that morning struck me as very odd. Something about it didn&apos;t quite add up: it had a long beak and short wings. &quot;Then it dawned on me - I was probably holding a large-billed reed warbler. I was dumbstruck. It felt as if I was holding a living dodo.&quot; The ornithologist called in Professor Staffan Bensch from Lund University in Sweden, who examined photographs and DNA of the Thai bird and confirmed it was the same species as the bird discovered 139 years previously. Prof Bensch has since confirmed that another bird, part of a collection of Blyth&apos;s reed warblers held by the Natural History Museum, is another example of the &quot;lost&quot; species. Dr Stuart Butchart, the global species programme coordinator at BirdLife International, said the appearance of the bird in Thailand was very surprising, because its short round wings suggested it could not have migrated from India. &quot;A priority now is to find out where the large-billed reed warbler&apos;s main population lives, whether it is threatened and, if so, how these threats can be addressed,&quot; he said. Dr Butchart added: &quot;Finding one large-billed reed warbler after 139 years was remarkable. Finding a second - right under ornithologists&apos; noses for that length of time - is nothing short of a miracle.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-03-07T11:46:00Z", "tags": ["Environment", "Conservation", "World news", "Wildlife", "Endangered species", "Thailand", "Animals", "Birdwatching", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/mar/07/conservationandendangeredspecies.internationalnews", "title": "'Lost' bird found after 140 years", "sentences": ["Then in March last year, ornithologist Philip Round found a live large-billed reed warbler while banding wild birds at a waste water treatment centre near Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Karen Kiernan&apos;s two-week backpacking holiday in Thailand with her boyfriend ended in a mad rush to get to Bangkok airport to fly home. The sleeper train taking them to the capital from the south of the country in plenty of time to make their flight arrived two hours late. Even though their Gulf Air flight was delayed, Karen and her boyfriend were unable to board, and since the airline had no spaces on other flights leaving that day they had little choice but to buy seats with another company. The cheapest option was Thai Airways, at a cost of \u00a3420 each. Karen, however, was confident she would be able to recover the cost. After all, she&apos;d been a customer with Columbus Insurance for more than two years and had made no previous claims. She had also obtained a form from the stationmaster in Bangkok explaining that the train had been delayed. On returning home, Karen and her boyfriend both filed claims with their respective insurers, but while her boyfriend was successful Karen&apos;s claim was turned down. Why? Because the reason for the train&apos;s delay was not stated clearly on the stationmaster&apos;s form. In fact, Karen had tried to get this information included on the paperwork, but faced with station staff with little or no English and a plane to catch she had to give up. It was maddening. Both policies contained exactly the same wording, and both travellers had submitted exactly the same form as evidence of the delay. Fighting the good fight It was almost as if the insurer was trying to use the wording of the policy to bully Karen into giving up on her claim. In fact, the wording in the policy may even have been invalid under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999, simply because it was too cut and dried and lacked the flexibility required by law to cover the variety of situations that may arise when travelling abroad. Why had Columbus Insurance relied on the strict letter of the policy to reject Karen&apos;s claim? After all, this was just the type of risk she hoped to cover by taking out insurance. A spokesman said the firm asks for proof of the reason for rail delays to check that the insured had not pulled the emergency cord or been involved in any fight or disturbance. He also said it helps the firm to better understand the routes taken by travellers abroad. Following our intervention, Columbus acknowledged that in this case there was no question of any skulduggery, and admitted Karen should have been paid straight away. The spokesman said some confusion had arisen because Karen had admitted having communication problems with the stationmaster, but agreed this should not have occurred. The company agreed to pay up immediately and apologised to Karen for any distress she may have suffered because of the delay in settling her claim. If at first you don&apos;t succeed ... Karen&apos;s experience shows you mustn&apos;t give up straight away if an insurance company rejects your claim. If you know you are genuine you have to be persistent and gather as much proof of your loss and the circumstances surrounding it as you can. Don&apos;t be deterred by small print in the policy since this is not always written in stone. And if the wording is not about the core terms of your policy, such as what is actually insured, it can be legally challenged if it is unfair. However, if you have not been entirely truthful when you take out a policy you may render it invalid. You must disclose in full anything that may influence the insurer in setting the premium, so be scrupulously honest when you complete the proposal. If you supply any false information the insurer is within its rights to refuse to pay out. For example, you are usually obliged to inform the insurer if you suffer from a recurring illness. Your health before you travel will be relevant to any claim you make for treatment. Some insurers may cover you for pre-existing medical conditions, but they won&apos;t pay for continuing or routine treatment, or cover you if you travel against medical advice. And if you think you can manage without travel insurance in EU countries where there are reciprocal arrangements for treatment, think again. These arrangements may not cover all your medical costs, nor will they always pay for your accommodation or repatriation if you have an accident or fall ill, so you must have a policy to cover these costs. Cover and claim You should aim for a policy that covers personal accident. This will ensure a lump sum is paid out if you die or suffer permanent injury while on holiday. And don&apos;t ignore the possibility of accidents to other people. For example, it&apos;s possible you could accidentally injure someone or damage their property on an activity holiday where you might ski or go scuba diving. For this you need personal liability cover, which usually pays out to a maximum amount of \u00a32m. After medical expenses, the next major worry for travellers is the loss, theft or damage of their money or possessions. Most policies cover these events, but losses must usually be reported to the police within 24 hours or the claim will not be met. If you can&apos;t find the police, for whatever reason, then inform your local tour representative since insurers will take a pragmatic approach if you&apos;ve done the best you can to let the authorities know. Don&apos;t forget there is usually a limit of \u00a31,500-\u00a33,000 on claims for personal belongings. As is the case with other types of insurance, your property will only be covered if you take reasonable care of it. An insurer can refuse to pay out if you are careless, but don&apos;t be fobbed off if you think an insurer is being unfair. You only have to exercise reasonable care, which in practice depends on the circumstances of the time. To avoid any problems take these simple precautions - never leave your possessions unattended, keep all your valuables, passports and money in the hotel safe wherever possible, and don&apos;t take more cash or valuables than you need. Don&apos;t count on your insurer paying in full even if you have a valid claim. This is because your policy may contain an excess - the amount of the claim you are required to pay yourself. Check the terms of your policy and if this seems too high look for a better policy with a lower excess or none at all. As a condition of the insurer&apos;s liability there are usually time limits for the notification of a claim, and although these are not absolute and can be challenged in the courts, it&apos;s always a good idea to inform the insurer of any claim you intend to make as soon as possible. As a rule of thumb, you should tell the insurer about your claim even before you have details of your loss.", "publicationDate": "2007-03-08T10:57:06Z", "tags": ["Money"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/mar/08/yourrights.legal", "title": "How to successfully claim on your insurance", "sentences": ["Karen Kiernan&apos;s two-week backpacking holiday in Thailand with her boyfriend ended in a mad rush to get to Bangkok airport to fly home.", "She had also obtained a form from the stationmaster in Bangkok explaining that the train had been delayed."]}, {"article": "\u00b7 Interest rates held steady \u00b7 Kathleen Hennessy answers your consumer questions  \u00b7 Feature: I fought the clause ...

Former taxi driver Rahan Arshad, 36, who denies murdering his sons Adam, 11, and Abbas, eight, daughter Henna, six, and his wife, Uzma Rahan, 32, described how he &quot;blanked out&quot; after making the discovery at the family home in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, on July 28 last year. He told Manchester crown court that he found his children dead in a downstairs room, then went upstairs to confront his wife, who said to him in Urdu: &quot;Are you satisfied?&quot; Mr Arshad said this was the last thing he could remember until he found himself in the bath holding a rounders bat, which has since been identified as the murder weapon. He said: &quot;I just blanked out.&quot; Mr Arshad then put the bat in the garden bin, covered the children&apos;s bodies with blankets, packed a bag and drove to Heathrow to board a pre-booked flight to Thailand. The bodies were discovered a month later. Mr Arshad&apos;s counsel, Ian Glen QC, asked him to explain why he had bought the single plane ticket two weeks previously. &quot;It would have been a holiday,&quot; he said. &quot;Uzma had been to Pakistan in February on her own and I needed a break as well.&quot; He said he did not tell his wife because he did not think she would let him go. Mr Arshad said that on the evening of the killings he had been arguing with his wife after he admitted that the family were not going on a holiday to Dubai the following week. Uzma was hoping he would buy her gold there, he said, and &quot;went crazy&quot; when he told her the truth. He had previously led her to believe that the trip was booked for the children&apos;s summer holiday, when in reality he had booked a single ticket to Bangkok, with the return leg booked for August 18. The Dubai trip was too expensive at \u00a37,100, Mr Arshad said. The court had heard earlier that Mr Arshad went to Bangkok with \u00a33,000 and the equivalent of \u00a31,160 in Thai currency. Mr Arshad said he did not return to Britain on August 18 as planned because he panicked. &quot;I didn&apos;t know what I was doing. I couldn&apos;t believe what was happening. I wanted to commit suicide actually,&quot; he said. When asked why he had told a Thai immigration official that he had phoned his wife after arriving in Bangkok, Mr Arshad said: &quot;I didn&apos;t know what to say. I was really scared.&quot; Mr Glen then asked what he had meant, when he reportedly told police: &quot;I confess to the murder ... but my kids, killing my kids.&quot; Mr Arshad said that he meant that he had killed Uzma, but that she had killed the children. He then denied murdering his daughter and two sons. Before Mr Arshad gave evidence, Mr Glen took the unusual step of directly addressing the jury. &quot;The question is, which one of them killed the children?&quot; he said. &quot;If the defendant returned home to find his wife had killed his three children, you can&apos;t imagine a better case for provocation for killing her. It is an unusual case, it is a shocking case.&quot; &quot;You may debate the possibilities. What mother, no mother could possibly kill her children? Leaving the slightly greater possibility of the father. It is no more likely that a father would do it than a mother would do it.&quot; &quot;We would say this- we have a father, or a mother, who was mentally ill. Only one of these two was mentally ill unfortunately, and that was Uzma, and that tends towards concluding she did it.&quot; The case continues.", "publicationDate": "2007-03-08T23:49:13Z", "tags": ["UK news", "Crime"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/mar/08/ukcrime.uknews4", "title": "Man accused of murdering family claims wife killed their children", "sentences": ["He had previously led her to believe that the trip was booked for the children&apos;s summer holiday, when in reality he had booked a single ticket to Bangkok, with the return leg booked for August 18.", "The court had heard earlier that Mr Arshad went to Bangkok with \u00a33,000 and the equivalent of \u00a31,160 in Thai currency.", "When asked why he had told a Thai immigration official that he had phoned his wife after arriving in Bangkok, Mr Arshad said: &quot;I didn&apos;t know what to say."]}, {"article": "Within two minutes of arriving at Benja, which promises &quot;a new type of Thai cuisine&quot; based on &quot;the flavours and tastes of Royal Siam&quot;, it was to the inspirational advice (expirational advice, technically, but we&apos;ll let that pedantry pass) of a certain Anna Leonowens that I found myself turning. &quot;Whenever I feel afraid, I hold my head erect,&quot; Missus Anna taught us in song, as she struggled to acclimatise to life with Yul Brynner, &quot;And whistle a happy tune/So no one will suspect I&apos;m afraid.&quot; But I was afraid, as a nervous looking staff clearly suspected, and even a whistled chorus of an exceedingly happy tune (Ossie&apos;s Dream, the Spurs&apos; 1981 Cup Final anthem) couldn&apos;t dissipate the fear that this was a wildly misconceived project ... a restaurant with wildly grandiose ambitions fatally undermined by the premises. Fortunes have been spent on fitting out three floors of a house in Soho with slate grey walls bedecked with lurid ceramic carp, two-tiered ceilings, intricately patterned silk banquettes, gilded wall panelling and, in the ground floor room where we ate, a stone statue of a Siamese maiden in an alcove all her own. It&apos;s sumptuously designed, but that sumptuousness demands a good deal of space and light to set it off. What it gets is a pokey town house better suited to a bustling trattoria, and the effect of so much lavishness in such a small, narrow, underlit room with tables crammed together is assonant, gloomy and oppressive. A glance at an inadequate wine list and a brief, unenticing menu brought the lips together once again, this time to dip into the oeuvre of The Clash (Should I Stay Or Should I Go). According to the publicity, the head chef is one ML Kwantip, scion of a family that for centuries cooked for Siamese kings, previously &quot;guest chef&quot; herself at a major Bangkok hotel, and a columnist for Thailand&apos;s leading woman&apos;s magazine. Whether &quot;head chef&quot; is an honorific title, allowing her to dictate menu and recipes from Bangkok, I&apos;ve no idea. But if she was in the kitchen this lunchtime, and if she cooks like her ancestors, you can see why Brynner&apos;s king was in such a foul mood. Where chicken satay ties in with &quot;a new type of Thai cuisine&quot; is one for the All Soul&apos;s high table, but it lacked any succulence and came with a feckless peanut sauce. In a blind tasting, I&apos;d have guessed &quot;locusts&quot; for the deep-fried frogs&apos; legs served with crispy lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves and some much-needed chilli sauce. As for the minced chicken curry puffs, I&apos;m still suffering stoically from the burn inflicted upon the soft palate when a bite into some clumping pastry unleashed a stream of molten chicken with a flavour reminiscent of the curry sauce offered as an accompaniment to chips in Chinese takeaways. Two salads were dismal little affairs, &quot;salad&quot; here meaning &quot;a couple of almost fresh radicchio leaves&quot;. My sister&apos;s one contrived to mingle three slices of cheap smoked salmon with a &quot;spicy sauce&quot; to replicate precisely - and this takes some doing - the flavour of a Polish kabanos sausage. My mushroom salad &quot;north-east style&quot; (laced with red onion and fresh chilli) can be dismissed with a brusque etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. The main courses were little better. A potent sauce of basil, chilli and garlic couldn&apos;t disguise the poor quality of a piece of allegedly sirloin steak, and while the initial flavour of my stewed lamb in yellow curry was impressive, the aftertaste was unsettlingly and bitterly cloying. The same went for a lukewarm medley of stir-fried vegetables in a thick, soy-based gravy. &quot;You will be nice about the staff, won&apos;t you?&quot; said my sister as we settled up, and I certainly will. The service was friendly and sweet, notably from one of the most delightful waitresses I&apos;ve ever met. She even came close to letting us smoke in defiance of house policy. &quot;In July, no smoking anyway by law,&quot; she pointed out, but I couldn&apos;t help wondering whether Benja will live to see the day. &quot;What&apos;s that you&apos;re whistling?&quot; asked my sister. &quot;A happy tune called Faur\u00e9&apos;s Requiem,&quot; I said, and after receiving a Buddhist bow from the waitress at the door, we took our leave.

Oliver Jufer, 57, pleaded guilty to five counts of insulting King Bhumibol Adulyadej by defacing portraits of the monarch with spray paint during celebrations of his 79th birthday last year.  The hearing in the northern city of Chang Mai took place behind closed doors and the prosecutor declined to reveal details of the case for fear the image of the king, the world&apos;s longest reigning monarch, might be tarnished.  But Jufer&apos;s court-appointed lawyer, Komkhit Kunyodying, said his client was drunk when he was caught on security cameras spraying black paint on the ubiquitous posters of the king in frustration at not being able to buy more alcohol. The lawyer said he hoped the guilty plea might reduce the jail term when Jufer is sentenced on March 29, though he feared that in the circumstances the judge could not sentence his client to less than seven-and-a-half years.  Thailand is one of the few countries that still prosecutes cases of lese-majeste. In the past charges have often been dropped or foreigners ordered out of the country after entering guilty pleas.  The king himself, who celebrated 60 years on the throne last year, said in an earlier birthday speech that he would no longer take lese-majeste charges seriously as it would put him above criticism.  &quot;I am not afraid if the criticism concerns what I do wrong, because then I know,&quot; he said. &quot;If you say the king cannot be criticised, it means that the king is not human.&quot;   Thais genuinely revere their monarch, with many donning yellow shirts as a mark of devotion each Monday, the day of his birth.

Rahan Arshad, 36, committed the murders and then fled on a pre-booked flight to Thailand, leaving the bodies to remain undiscovered in the family home at Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, for almost a month. He beat his wife with the bat more than 23 times in their bedroom before attacking his children. Pathologists needed dental records to confirm the identities of the four victims. Arshad, who worked as a driver for Tripps taxis, murdered Uzma Rahan, 32, their sons Adam, 11, eight-year-old Abbas and daughter Henna, six, because of his wife&apos;s affair with a married man named Nikki, Manchester crown court heard. The jury took two hours and 15 minutes to find Arshad guilty of four counts of murder. He showed almost no reaction as the verdicts were read out.  &quot;The jury have convicted you on overwhelming evidence of the brutal and horrific murder of your wife and children,&quot; Mr Justice Clarke said. &quot;The only sentence permitted by law is life imprisonment on each count.  &quot;You killed your entire family in circumstances of great brutality. Life imprisonment in your case means life.&quot; The murders are thought to have taken place either late on the evening of July 28 last year or early the following morning. On August 20, police found the four bodies at the house the couple shared. Ms Rahan&apos;s partially clothed body was found in the master bedroom, covered with a beige towel. The children&apos;s remains, in their playroom on the ground floor, had been covered with bedsheets.  The bodies were badly decomposed, and some had been infested with maggots. All the victims had been beaten to death with the rounders bat, which was bought by Arshad on July 27 and later found hidden in a bag in the garden shed. His new silver BMW was recorded driving south along the M6 towards Heathrow by motorway cameras at around 7am on July 29.  He left the car in the short-stay car park, boarding a flight to Bangkok later that day. Thai police arrested him at the country&apos;s border with Malaysia on August 30.  Shortly after being arrested, he told police: &quot;I confess to the murder. My beautiful kids. I don&apos;t regret killing that fucking bitch, but my kids, killing my kids ...&quot;. He refused to answer police questions, but in January gave a statement to prosecutors in which he claimed his wife killed the children. The court heard that Arshad had discovered his wife&apos;s infidelity years before the attack. He claimed he returned home after a fight with his wife on the evening of July 28 and found the children lying on the floor of the playroom, saying he went upstairs to confront her and she taunted him by saying: &quot;Are you satisfied now?&quot; Arshad said she murdered the children and he was provoked into killing her, but could not remember the attack. He said he had booked the flight to Thailand so he could have a holiday, and did not tell his wife about the trip because he feared she would not let him go. The court heard that he went to Bangkok with \u00a33,000 and the equivalent of \u00a31,160 in Thai currency. He said he did not return to Britain on August 18 as planned because he panicked. &quot;I didn&apos;t know what I was doing. I couldn&apos;t believe what was happening. I wanted to commit suicide, actually,&quot; he said. When asked why he had told a Thai immigration official that he had phoned his wife after arriving in Bangkok, Arshad said: &quot;I didn&apos;t know what to say. I was really scared.&quot; Forensic investigations suggest Ms Rahan was clubbed to death by Arshad while being chased around the bedroom of the house.  Arshad took his sleeping children from their beds to a downstairs playroom one by one and beat them to death. DNA and blood samples covered the floor, furniture and walls of the room and the upper master bedroom.  Examination of the scene suggested Arshad laid his sleeping daughter&apos;s head on a cushion before beating her to death. He then placed another cushion over her head. Blood traces were recovered from Arshad&apos;s clothes, shoes, and the rounders bat, which he had tried to scrub clean before putting it in a plastic bag and hiding it in the shed. Detective Superintendent Martin Bottomley, who led the inquiry, said: &quot;The three officers who were first at the scene were faced with complete devastation. It is a scene they will never ever forget.  &quot;It was so horrific. It is a man coming home and battering his wife to death and then doing exactly the same with his children.

Four members of the jury at Manchester crown court wept as Judge David Clarke told Rahan Arshad, 36, that life meant life and that he would never be freed on licence. Arshad closed his eyes as the jury of eight women and four men delivered their unanimous verdicts after deliberating for just over two hours. Rahat Ali, brother of Arshad&apos;s wife, Uzma, shouted &quot;Yes!&quot; as the first guilty verdict was returned. Arshad had denied four charges of murder but admitted the manslaughter of his wife, claiming he killed her after she had murdered their daughter and two sons at the family home in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, last July. Arshad returned voluntarily to the UK from the far east and, when arrested at Heathrow, told police: &quot;My beautiful kids. I don&apos;t regret killing that fucking bitch, but my kids, killing my kids ...&quot; In an impact statement read to the court, Mr Ali, who was in court with his mother, Safia Hassnain, and brother, Mustajab Ali Haider, said he had not slept between the discovery of the bodies and Arshad&apos;s return to Britain and told of his grief at seeing the four bodies on the mortuary slab. He said his sister had been his &quot;best mate&quot; and the pain of losing her and her children was at times unbearable. &quot;None of us could understand how a father could do such a thing to his children and his wife also ... What must they have been thinking when it was happening to them, especially the children?&quot; The judge told Arshad: &quot;The jury have convicted you on overwhelming evidence ... You killed your entire family in circumstances of great brutality. You beat your wife to death in her bedroom and then coldly and deliberately you brought your sleepy children downstairs to meet their deaths. You left the scene and fled the country. It was over three weeks before the bodies were discovered. There is no suggestion of mental illness on your part.&quot; Arshad insisted throughout the trial that he had not killed his children. He said that when he found the bodies lying in a downstairs room, he went upstairs to confront his wife, who he claimed had said: &quot;Are you satisfied?&quot; He had then &quot;blanked out&quot;. &quot;I found myself in the shower, in the bath,&quot; he told the court. &quot;I mean in the bath. I found myself in the bath with the bat.&quot; He said he did not know exactly what had happened to Uzma, who suffered 23 blows to her head and body from the bat he had bought the previous day and later hid in his garden shed. The court heard that Uzma, whom Arshad married in 1992 and described as &quot;an absolute beauty&quot;, had been again living with her husband after an affair. Arshad attacked her in a bedroom and covered her body with a towel. He then carried each of his sleeping children downstairs, battering first Abbas, eight, then Henna, six, and finally Adam, 11. He covered their bodies after each attack. After the murders, late on July 28 or July 29 2006, he drove to Heathrow in his BMW, caught a plane to Bangkok and travelled on to the resort of Phuket. The decomposing bodies were found more than three weeks later after a neighbour smelled rotting flesh. The court heard he had told his wife and children that they were about to go on holiday to Dubai, where Uzma wanted to buy gold. He told the children they were not going to Dubai when he took them to Blackpool shortly before he killed them. Mr Ali said outside the court: &quot;My family and I finally feel we can relax. For months we have been in terrible shock. No one can heal the grief we have suffered. My mother can&apos;t understand how [Arshad] could destroy [my sister]. The judge made a brilliant decision.

If you approach it from the main road, the Cambodian National Theatre looks like many of the other derelict buildings dotted around the city, if a little more modernist and angular. In 1994, it was gutted by fire, the result of some careless workmen and a gas stove. With no funds for reconstruction, it remains exactly as it must have appeared the morning after the blaze - a scorched shell, roofless, ravaged and open to the elements. But it is only when you enter the building that you perceive the full extent of what&apos;s going on in this extraordinary theatre. Despite the devastation, it&apos;s a hive of activity. Actors practise their roles on a stage that is now little more than a mound of scorched concrete, overgrown with palm trees. Dancers lope around the rubble doing physical exercises, or swing gently in hammocks under the stage. An army of set-builders stagger over boulders in the gutted auditorium, putting the finishing touches to magnificent gilded pagodas and royal carriages. In fact, everything continues as it must have done when this was a full, working performance space. &quot;Before it was destroyed, this theatre was the best in Asia,&quot; says dancer Nup Samoeun, who has been with the company for 29 years. &quot;Even though it has burned down, we still practise and do everything as before. We have no other place to go.&quot; From a western perspective, the fact that this establishment manages to function and create works that tour the world is astounding. Its traditional dance piece Weyreap&apos;s Battle, a collaboration with the Cambodian University of Fine Arts and an independent outfit called Amrita Performing Arts, comes to the Barbican in London this week. For Cambodians, the burned-out theatre is a symbol for the country&apos;s stubborn, beleaguered culture in general. Under the murderous regime of Pol Pot, which lasted from 1975-79, Cambodia and its people came under one of the most ferocious and sustained attacks in history. An estimated 1.7 million people were killed and many millions more displaced to the countryside, as the dictator tried to implement his brutal brand of rural socialism. Nowhere were the policies applied more barbarously than to artists, writers and intellectuals, with an estimated 90% wiped out. This included anyone with secondary or tertiary education. Even people wearing glasses risked summary execution, just for looking brainy. Thirty years on, Cambodian culture has yet to recover. &quot;There are only about 100 writers in this country,&quot; according to You Bo of the writer&apos;s union. &quot;And of that amount, only about 10 have any decent level of education.&quot; One cultural sphere that suffered particularly badly was Cambodia&apos;s 1,000-year-old dance tradition. Before the rise of the Khmer Rouge, there were about 30 troupes performing Lakhaon Kaol, the intricate, masked, all-male sacred form that boasts 4,000 gestures in its movement vocabulary. It was a tradition that existed exclusively in the minds and muscles of the masters who practised it - and thus was almost entirely obliterated during the Pol Pot genocide. After the regime fell, the government launched a nationwide radio campaign to unearth surviving masters of the Kaol. The library of thousands of gestures was pieced together, like fragments of shattered earthenware. Even so, only a handful of the original companies were re-established, and these only on an ad hoc basis to perform for weddings and funerals. So, when it came to staging Weyreap&apos;s Battle - the first major Kaol production in more than 30 years - the challenges were huge. &quot;We travelled to tiny villages, only accessible by boat,&quot; says Fred Frumberg of Amrita. &quot;We tracked down forgotten masters and brought them to the city to make the piece.&quot; One of the choreographers of the piece, Pum Bun Chanrath, was famous in the 1960s and early 70s for his depiction of the role of Hanuman, the mighty Monkey King. But when the Khmer Rouge took over, he was thrown in jail and tortured; he seemed destined for execution. When his guards asked him about his profession, he plumped for the honest approach: &quot;I told them I was a Monkey Dancer,&quot; he says. &quot;The soldier had no idea what that was, and so asked me to give a demonstration. But I was so malnourished and thin that I couldn&apos;t even stand up. All I could do was a pathetic suggestion of itching and scratching.&quot; It was enough to send the guard into paroxysms of laughter, and he was kept alive - and well fed - for future performances. &quot;About a month later, I was released from prison. Most of the people I knew perished. Perhaps it was the Monkey Dance that kept me alive.&quot; To create Weyreap, Chanrath and his fellow masters spent five months in 2003, teaching the thousands of intricate hand gestures to a new generation of dancers, some of whom had never seen Kaol before. The result, which I saw performed in an open market square adjacent to the burned-out theatre, is an irrepressible, often naive riot of colour and tender-hearted good humour. When the platoons of monkey warriors arrive, they scratch their backsides, wriggle about and sniff each other. The sea creatures, with their giant papier-mache claws and flashing eyes, look for all the world like mythical Cambodian undersea ravers.

Oliver Rudolf Jufer, 57, was jailed for spray-painting graffiti over five posters of Thailand&apos;s revered king. It is the first conviction of a foreigner in a decade under strict Thai laws protecting the monarchy. Jufer, who pleaded guilty to five counts of lese majeste, or insulting the monarchy, faced a maximum sentence of 75 years in prison. He has a month to appeal. Judge Phitsanu Tanbukalee told the court that Jufer was given a reduced sentence since he had admitted his wrongdoing. Jufer was caught by surveillance cameras on December 5 spray-painting black paint over five outdoor posters of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in the northern city of Chiang Mai, where he had lived for 10 years, police and prosecutors said. The Thai king is greatly loved in Thailand, with some believing he is semi-divine. According to earlier testimony read aloud in court, Jufer had been drinking with a friend before driving his motorcycle home to pick up a can of spray paint, which he had bought to paint his dog house. He drove up to a municipal office where a large poster of the king was hung outside, and climbed a ladder to spray-paint over the image. He then defaced four other posters near his home, according to the testimony. Jufer&apos;s court-appointed lawyer, Komkrit Kunyodying, called the penalty &quot;appropriate for the crime he has committed&quot;, adding he did not yet know if his client planned to appeal.

Photograph: Rungroj Yongrit/EPAYou could call it &apos;repression lite&apos;. You can&apos;t censor the whole internet - unless you commit China-sized resources to this - so why not target YouTube? Thailand has become the latest nation to respond to a perceived slight to its national honour with a blanket ban on the video sharing website, after YouTube refused to remove a clip ridiculing the country&apos;s revered king. The 44 second clip is amateurish, distinctly juvenile and seems expressly intended to inflame the feelings of Thai people.  It shows a picture of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, which is then defaced with some crudely drawn animated additions and - most seriously - placed directly underneath a photo of a woman&apos;s feet, something gravely disrespectful to Thais. Insulting the king is a serious offence in Thailand - a fact a Swiss man found out to his cost last week when he was jailed for 10 years. After YouTube said it would not take down the clip, Thailand&apos;s military appointed government, installed after Thaksin Shinawatra&apos;s administration was ousted in a coup in September, responded by blocking local access to the entire site. It comes less than a month after a Turkish court suspended access to YouTube in response to the posting of a clip which reportedly labelled the country&apos;s modern founding father, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, a homosexual. In limiting access to even part of the web, the countries are joining a small and distinctly unsavoury club. The media freedom group, Reporters Without Borders, lists 13 &quot;enemies of the Internet&quot;, and none of them are exactly famed as exponents of liberty and free expression. They range from China, with its infamous, all-encompassing &quot;Great Firewall&quot;, to North Korea, where access is limited to a few top ranking officials and the country&apos;s official .nk domain name has yet to be even used. Turkey and Thailand would no doubt argue that they are acting against grave slurs against the whole nation. But to outsiders, the offending clips look like teenage name calling and provocation - and let&apos;s face it, if you want to remove that from the web you&apos;re in for a struggle.", "publicationDate": "2007-04-04T14:32:27Z", "tags": ["Internet", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2007/apr/04/youtubecensors", "title": "King of insults sees royal knockout for YouTube", "sentences": ["Riot police stand in front of a portrait of Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Holiday souvenirs have come a long way since the sombrero and straw donkey. It\u2019s not just that there are better goods on offer, travellers have upped the ante when it comes to holiday buys. Witness pre-Christmas New York. The lure of the weak dollar in the run-up to the festive season sparked feverish shopping by British holidaymakers \u2013 so much so that airlines laid on extra flights to cope with demand.  But if you fear becoming a slave to shopping, there\u2019s no better place to head than Bangkok. Here, retail therapy is the best way to get to grips with a city that puts shopping, eating and bargaining at the centre of everyday life. &quot;Bangkok has a mix of tradition and modernity,&quot; explains travel writer Hana Borrowman, who\u2019s worked in Bangkok for two years. &quot;Huge neon billboards and shopping malls sit next to temples and tiny Chinese shophouses.&quot; This combination of old and new makes Bangkok unique and helps to explain a city capable of mixing ancient lanna (northern) traditions with contemporary fashions, where monks happily shop alongside impeccably-styled teenagers, and where every shop has its own spirit house. And if you arm yourself with a pocketful of baht you\u2019ll bag far more than a bargain. You\u2019ll get a shopping experience like no other.  The future is orange  Downriver to Tha Maharat and the Amulet Market (Phra Chan Road) Seating, reclined, lotus, standing or calling for rain: whatever the preference, the Amulet Market supplies a Buddha to fit. This sweltering undercover market also sells religious relics, pictures of esteemed monks, images of the King, &quot;Long Live the King&quot; bracelet-and-pen sets and monk\u2019s robes. The heady mix of Buddhist imagery and royal merchandise underlines just how much the Thais love and revere their royal family. Fittingly the market is a short stroll from Bangkok\u2019s most illustrious temple: the dazzling Wat Phra Kaew, home to the dainty Emerald Buddha, which sits in the grounds of the royal palace. Preening and pouting  Downriver to Saphan Taksin, and then onto the Bangkok Mass Transit System (BTS) Skytrain to Siam The Skytrain is one of the wonders of Bangkok: an air-conditioned monorail soaring above gridlocked streets and supplying views of the lush city below. It also leads direct to Bangkok\u2019s youth culture at Siam Square. In fact, the Skytrain cleaves the Siam retail experience in two: on one side are high-end malls (Siam Paragon and Siam Discovery), while on the other are the teen-friendly streets of Siam Square. Edgy designers sell original clothes in exclusive boutiques, while Manga-themed cafes jostle with ice-cream parlours. It\u2019s here that a young, style-conscious crowd \u2013 known as the &quot;Dek Naew&quot; - gather to preen, parade and pout.  Faux dreadlocks and falafel  The Khao San Road, Banglamphu For anyone who &quot;discovered&quot; Thailand in the 90s, nothing shows how mainstream it has become better than the Khao San Road. What began as a huddle of backpacker-friendly dorms has morphed into something akin to a Thai Glastonbury, where young farangs (tourists) parade newly minted fisherman pants, woven-in dreadlocks and still-raw tattoos. But curb your cynicism and you\u2019ll be seduced by the buzz that comes courtesy of all those bright, young backpackers fresh off the plane. Their energy ensures every Khao San weekend is packed \u2013 and keeps prices at rock bottom. Here, street stalls sell cutting-edge clothes by local designers alongside traveller kit. Wholesale silver shops stock cut-price jewellery. Local bookshops peddle hard-to-get south-east Asian travel writing. And every evening, activity racks up a notch, with food stalls and bars mushrooming up along the humid streets. Waving the flag  Around Banglamphu to the Chao Phraya Express Boat, Tha Banglamphu Khao San Road is at the heart of one of Bangkok\u2019s loveliest districts, with family-run shops and stalls making up Banglamphu Market. Nearby, Phra Sumen Road has been turned over to royalty. In preparation for King Bhumibol Adulyadej\u2019s 80th birthday, shops selling flags, tuk-tuk-sized royal portraits and t-shirts bearing the royal crest abound. Banglamphu is also home to Santichaiprakan Park, where the swaying trees and riverside vista offer sanctuary from the incessant roar of traffic. And where there\u2019s a retail opportunity, there\u2019s a street vendor: mobile ice-carts flog 10-baht bags of fresh pineapple.  Bangkok\u2019s biggest: MBK  Via the elevated walkway from Siam Square, or BTS National Stadium  Mahboonkhrong - or MBK \u2013 is a cavernous shopping complex that crams in hundreds of stalls over six floors. The noise, neon and crowds can be dizzying, but an in-house cinema (with waitress service) and rooftop bar make up for it. And the higher you go, the cheaper the prices. This is the place to buy wallet-friendly trainers and Birkenstocks, as well as leather handbags, jewellery and t-shirts. In fact, there\u2019s not much you can\u2019t buy at MBK, though be warned: most of the (incredibly cheap) branded footwear and clothing is fake. But at these prices \u2026 Market madness  Into Greater Bangkok \u2013 taking the Skytrain to Mo Chit If MBK whets your appetite for large-scale shopping, head to Chatuchack (&quot;JJ&quot; to the locals), a weekend market whose 15,000 stalls cater for the masses. Selling everything from hilltribe crafts to live animals, it\u2019s here the Dek Naew come to get designer copies and second-hand clothes. &quot;The best section is the vintage one \u2013 with breathtaking pieces like retro Vivienne Westwood and Miu Miu, or quirky stuff from Hong Kong, Korea and Tokyo,&quot; says Borrowman.  It seems that the further you dig into Bangkok\u2019s markets and malls the more you understand that it\u2019s a defiantly modern and undeniably Thai city. Just make sure you look up from your bargaining every so often to check out a city that never stops buying and selling.  How to shop like a local 1. Few prices are fixed, so be prepared to bargain. Shop around to get a feel for prices - and enjoy it. &quot;Don\u2019t take it too seriously,&quot; says Joe Bindloss, author of Lonely Planet&apos;s Southeast Asia on a Shoestring. &quot;Don\u2019t get all red in the face arguing over what amounts to a few pence.&quot;  2. Get a good map \u2013 Bangkok\u2019s streets can look awfully similar. 3. &quot;Be cautious,&quot; advises Bindloss. &quot;There are plenty of shysters in Bangkok \u2013 the gem sale patter is the oldest in the book.&quot; If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.  4. Don\u2019t go hungry. Roads, streets and squares heave with cheap edible delights, and the best Bangkok food is street food.  5. Learn a smattering of Thai. A few words will raise a smile and secure better prices when bargaining.   Best time to visit The September 2006 military coup \u2013 that saw the prime minister ousted in favour of an interim government \u2013 should be settled by this summer\u2019s elections. But Thailand isn\u2019t without problems. Insurgency along the Malaysian border and the December 31 bombs in Bangkok mean it\u2019s a good idea to keep informed. The Foreign Office recommends &quot;caution when travelling within Bangkok&quot;. But, reckons Joe Bindloss, it\u2019s worth maintaining perspective. \u2018Thailand has had 22 coups since 1932,\u2019 he says. \u2018And none of them have had any effect on tourism.&quot;  Getting there \u00b7 Thai Airways, has direct flights.\u00b7 Buddy Lodge Hotel offers a little bit of luxury in the heart of the Khao San Road \u2013 check out its rooftop pool.\u00b7 Good sources of information: The Bangkok Post; The Footprint Guide 2007; Lonely Planet City Guide to Bangkok; Nancy Chandler\u2019s Map of Bangkok.", "publicationDate": "2007-04-05T12:23:59Z", "tags": ["Travel", "Bangkok holidays", "Thailand holidays", "Shopping trips"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/apr/05/bangkok.thailand.shoppingtrips", "title": "Bangkok till you drop", "sentences": ["But if you fear becoming a slave to shopping, there\u2019s no better place to head than Bangkok.", "&quot;Bangkok has a mix of tradition and modernity,&quot; explains travel writer Hana Borrowman, who\u2019s worked in Bangkok for two years.", "&quot;Huge neon billboards and shopping malls sit next to temples and tiny Chinese shophouses.&quot; This combination of old and new makes Bangkok unique and helps to explain a city capable of mixing ancient lanna (northern) traditions with contemporary fashions, where monks happily shop alongside impeccably-styled teenagers, and where every shop has its own spirit house.", "Fittingly the market is a short stroll from Bangkok\u2019s most illustrious temple: the dazzling Wat Phra Kaew, home to the dainty Emerald Buddha, which sits in the grounds of the royal palace.", "Preening and pouting  Downriver to Saphan Taksin, and then onto the Bangkok Mass Transit System (BTS) Skytrain to Siam The Skytrain is one of the wonders of Bangkok: an air-conditioned monorail soaring above gridlocked streets and supplying views of the lush city below.", "It also leads direct to Bangkok\u2019s youth culture at Siam Square.", "Waving the flag  Around Banglamphu to the Chao Phraya Express Boat, Tha Banglamphu Khao San Road is at the heart of one of Bangkok\u2019s loveliest districts, with family-run shops and stalls making up Banglamphu Market.", "Bangkok\u2019s biggest: MBK  Via the elevated walkway from Siam Square, or BTS National Stadium  Mahboonkhrong - or MBK \u2013 is a cavernous shopping complex that crams in hundreds of stalls over six floors.", "But at these prices \u2026 Market madness  Into Greater Bangkok \u2013 taking the Skytrain to Mo Chit If MBK whets your appetite for large-scale shopping, head to Chatuchack (&quot;JJ&quot; to the locals), a weekend market whose 15,000 stalls cater for the masses.", "It seems that the further you dig into Bangkok\u2019s markets and malls the more you understand that it\u2019s a defiantly modern and undeniably Thai city.", "Get a good map \u2013 Bangkok\u2019s streets can look awfully similar.", "&quot;There are plenty of shysters in Bangkok \u2013 the gem sale patter is the oldest in the book.&quot; If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.", "Roads, streets and squares heave with cheap edible delights, and the best Bangkok food is street food.", "Insurgency along the Malaysian border and the December 31 bombs in Bangkok mean it\u2019s a good idea to keep informed.", "The Foreign Office recommends &quot;caution when travelling within Bangkok&quot;.", "\u2018And none of them have had any effect on tourism.&quot;  Getting there \u00b7 Thai Airways, has direct flights.\u00b7 Buddy Lodge Hotel offers a little bit of luxury in the heart of the Khao San Road \u2013 check out its rooftop pool.\u00b7 Good sources of information: The Bangkok Post; The Footprint Guide 2007; Lonely Planet City Guide to Bangkok; Nancy Chandler\u2019s Map of Bangkok."]}, {"article": "John Lloyd told me back in San Jose that I was going to be in the team. We were sitting down in the players&apos; lounge getting some food and waiting for Andy to go on because he was playing a night match. John told me about how the team were going to stay at The Belfry and would be getting Hugo Boss suits for the dinner and stuff, and then he said, out of the blue, &quot;By the way, you&apos;re in the team.&quot; And then he carried on talking. It was pretty random, I&apos;ll give him that. I was totally surprised and didn&apos;t really take in any more of the conversation at all. I guess Andy knew, but he let John tell me. I didn&apos;t actually tell my mum and dad for a while. In fact I didn&apos;t officially tell them, they heard through other people. I don&apos;t know why - probably because I was away in the States and it just didn&apos;t happen that way. We all got together, except Andy, last Thursday at Roehampton for the opening of the National Tennis Centre. I got to speak to the Queen. You introduce yourself and then she asks you some questions - nothing unbelievably exciting but it&apos;s good to say you&apos;ve met the Queen. There has been a great rapport in the camp. We&apos;ve played a bit of golf, went to watch Fulham v Portsmouth last Saturday - all good for team bonding - although Flossie [John Lloyd] picked the match and he got a lot of abuse for it. It wasn&apos;t the best. Andy and me didn&apos;t ever talk about playing together in the Davis Cup when we were kids but we watched a lot of the matches on TV and actually went to some of the ties. But it was obviously something we both wanted to do. He&apos;s done a bit more than me, but hopefully if I get the results I&apos;ll be able to play in a lot more ties. The stat is that the winners of the doubles match wins 80% of Davis Cup ties, four in five. So it&apos;s obviously important. I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll be nervous at the start of the match - it&apos;s only natural. It would be a bad thing if I weren&apos;t. One of my goals was to establish myself in the Davis Cup team. I knew we needed a doubles player to take the pressure off the others. I got some results and I thought I should be in the team after winning titles in Dallas, San Jose and Memphis. Everybody says Davis Cup is different from everything else. It is. But at the end of the day it&apos;s still a doubles match for me and I&apos;ve been playing at the highest level for the last few months. I&apos;m confident in my own ability. Now it&apos;s a case of going out there and showing people I can play. When Andy and me were growing we were not as close as we are now. We were playing the same events but then he went off to Spain and we really didn&apos;t see each other a lot until last year. Now it&apos;s a lot more fun because we get to hang out a bit. He&apos;s thrilled to bits with what I have been doing, and then getting into the team. He&apos;s always been my greatest supporter, and is so happy when I am doing well. I left Miami to come back to meet the Queen so I didn&apos;t get to see him play his semi-final last week. I obviously know something was up because it not every day he loses 6-1, 6-0. But once he got here I thought he would be fine. I&apos;m sure he has some sort of pain or whatever and something is not quite right. But he&apos;s big enough to say if he can play or not and he looked good in practice. I&apos;ve got to know his coach, Brad Gilbert, who is also with us here, really well since he started to work with Andy. He&apos;s been really good to me and I have to thank him a lot for that. He doesn&apos;t need to. He would practise with me and help me out on certain things and give me advice. He came and watched all my matches in the US. It&apos;s great to look up and have Brad giving you motivation. It inspires you. It&apos;s been fantastic. I spent two weeks with Tim Henman in Bangkok and Tokyo last year and we practised and went for dinner. He&apos;s also been really good to me, really supportive, especially the last few months. He has texted me after my matches. He doesn&apos;t need to do that, but he&apos;s keen for me to do well. I never really thought I would get the chance to be on the team with Tim and Greg Rusedski, and obviously Andy is there as well which makes it that bit special - really exciting.

Over more than 1,500 pages, scientists analyse what impact climate change will have on wildlife, habitats and communities around the world and what can be done to reduce the problems and threats faced by different countries. Who has written it?The report is the work of hundreds of scientists who have reviewed scientific, environmental and socio-economic papers on the impacts of climate change. The scientists form the IPCC&apos;s second working group, which has been chaired by Professor Martin Parry of the Met Office and Osvaldo Canziani. Their work has been commented on and added to by the representatives of more than 100 governments around the world. The wording of the completed report, and a 21-page summary for policymakers, is being approved this week at a conference in Brussels. What will it say?The report is expected to warn that a scarcity of water, food and land brought about by climate change could lead to tension between nations and even war. Millions of people around the world will be affected by drought or flooding, with many forced to leave their homes in search of water, or find safer places to live away from rising sea levels. It is expected to say that rising temperatures predicted in the IPCC&apos;s last report will lead to more hunger in Africa and more heatwaves in the US. The heat could melt glaciers in the Himalayas and further damage Australia&apos;s Great Barrier Reef. Agriculture may be affected around the world, with many countries seeing a reduction in the amount of food they can produce, although some such as Canada and Russia may initially be more productive as their climate warms. The outlook for wildlife is ominous, according to Reuters, which says a draft version of the report warns that 20-30% of species are likely to be at risk of extinction if the global average temperature rises by 1.5-2.5C. What happens next?Next week the IPCC will hold regional briefings around the world to explain the observed and predicted impacts of climate change on each region. The IPCC will publish one more paper before its fourth assessment report on November 16. The Mitigation of Climate Change report will be released on May 4 in Bangkok, then details from it and the other two reports will be brought together in the Synthesis Report. The IPPC says this final report will pay more attention to the integration of climate change with sustainable development than its last assessment report, published in 2001. It will also focus more on the relationships between mitigation of the threat of climate change and adaptation to the problems it could cause.", "publicationDate": "2007-04-06T15:38:17Z", "tags": ["Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)", "Climate change", "Environment"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/apr/06/ipcc.climatechange", "title": "Q&A: IPCC report on impact of climate change", "sentences": ["The Mitigation of Climate Change report will be released on May 4 in Bangkok, then details from it and the other two reports will be brought together in the Synthesis Report."]}, {"article": "A row over images mocking Thailand&apos;s revered monarch deepened yesterday after two new videos were posted on the popular video-sharing website YouTube.

In a new 42-second video posted by &quot;thaifreespeech&quot;, the 79-year-old monarch&apos;s face is replaced with that of a monkey. &quot;This ... would give up to 15 years prison in Thailand, because their leaders are evil and hate free speech,&quot; says a caption.

Ian Proud, 38, wrote a seemingly innocent set of entries about life in Bangkok for the Nation newspaper&apos;s website as he neared the end of a four-year posting in Thailand. Too many readers, however, were interested in just one thing - was the Mr Proud pictured on the blog&apos;s home page the same man they claimed to have seen regularly in Bangkok&apos;s red light district? After several days of unwelcome publicity, Mr Proud&apos;s entries - and photograph - were today unavailable on his blog pages, with only a few innocuous comments remaining.

The media praised the clubs for their newfound patience and wondered if this relative stability would herald a better, less-pressurised future. Of course, it couldn&apos;t last. After the turn of the year six more coaches fell by the wayside in quick succession and, last Tuesday, Hertha&apos;s Falko G\u00f6tz became the ninth manager to lose his job this season. G\u00f6tz&apos;s downfall, his second dismissal at the club within three years, had been coming for a while: his team all but collapsed after a decent start to the season, and a run of eight games without a win threatened their Bundesliga existence. The capital was rife with rumours about the manager&apos;s supposed loss of authority and all sorts of strange stories abounded. The carefully groomed G\u00f6tz, a man often suspected of being &quot;more fond of his hairdryer than of tactical analysis&quot; (Tagesspiegel), allegedly had chewing-gum thrown at him in the dressing-room, saw young players text their friends on mobile phones during his tactical speeches and actually prohibited drinking Coca-Cola before matches, only for the general manager Dieter Hoene\u00df, the real power at the club, to dismiss that advice publicly. Hoene\u00df chose the U-23 coach Karsten Heine as G\u00f6tz&apos;s successor and on Saturday, Hertha finally won a game again, 3-1 away to Bochum. (Theofanis Gekas scored the hosts&apos; goal, of course, his 17th of the season.) Heine should prevent the worst but the long-term outlook is bleak. Hertha have grand ambitions but umpteen dodgy transfers and general financial mismanagement has left them with huge debts. Forced to play many youngsters, the club was initially praised for giving their talents a chance, but said talents - the German international Malik Fathi, Kevin-Prince Boateng or Ashkan Dejagah - proved inconsistent on the pitch and perhaps not quite smart enough off it to deal with the pressure. Hertha have also managed the considerable feat of employing the league&apos;s worst keeper in Christian Fiedler. He really plays like a &quot;Berliner,&quot; which is to say like a doughnut. Supposed leaders of the team such as Yildiray Bast\u00fcrk and Arne Friedrich have either been injured, eyeing moves to bigger sides, or both. Graham Poll&apos;s favourite player, Joe Simunic - the Croatian who was booked thrice at the World Cup - has been a disaster, too, after signing a bigger, better deal in the summer: he spent the winter break boasting about a patently nonexistent offer from Chelsea and was said to have been one of the chief plotters against G\u00f6tz. Some suspect an even bigger conspiracy at the heart of Hertha&apos;s troubles. As we know, the devil&apos;s greatest trick was convincing the world he didn&apos;t exist. Did Bayern boss Uli Hoene\u00df, the Bundesliga&apos;s own Keyser Soze, pull off a similar coup by installing his less talented younger brother in the Hertha job, thus ensuring that the capital should never challenge Bayern&apos;s hegemony? That&apos;s obviously an untenable theory - not even Uli is that powerful. But there&apos;s no getting away from the fact that Dieter, who never had a good touch for a big man and was perhaps the least talented player ever to feature in a World Cup final (he featured in 1986), is as clumsy in his business dealings as he was with the ball at his feet. All he could ever do was head it, very powerfully; even a big gash across the head didn&apos;t stop him in the German FA Cup final of 1982. &quot;Turban Dieter&quot; headed in Bayern&apos;s fourth goal, bleeding profusely through the bandages. Somehow these heroics were not enough to transform him into a Terry Butcher-figure; his playing style, if you can call it that, was always too awkward. His name became a byword for unwieldiness. To this day kids tease each other by saying, &quot;You Hoene\u00df!&quot; in the schoolyard. Maybe all those headers have come back to haunt him. N\u00fcrnberg manager Hans Meyer, on the other hand, was smart enough to walk away from the Hertha job in 2004, after saving the club from relegation. His bunch of non-dodgy Eastern Europeans are riding high in the league: They are on course for a Uefa Cup place and can qualify for the German Cup final on Tuesday. &quot;Springtime Happiness&quot; and &quot;Mister Lady&quot; might sound like two Bangkok massage parlours, but on Saturday the two were a winning combination in the EasyCredit-Stadion. The 20-year-old Chhunly Pagenburg, whose first name does indeed mean &quot;Springtime Happiness&quot; in Cambodia, from where his mother hails, wore the N\u00fcrnberg shirt sponsored by the confusingly named jeans company for his first ever start. The crafty midfielder scored the winning goal against Aachen and became an instant favourite with the fans: he&apos;s the only N\u00fcrnberg-born player in the squad. Meyer still calls him &quot;the little one&quot;, however, and told reporters mischievously that he considered Pagenburg, at 1.78cm, &quot;only slightly taller than a pig&quot;. That was meant as a compliment, probably. Meyer, unlike G\u00f6tz, knows how to handle youngsters. And he must be credited for limiting the influence of club president Michael A. Roth (the &quot;A&quot; stands for Adolf, he was born in 1935, you see). Roth is a Franconian carpet-dealership-mini-oligarch who has kept the club afloat with his millions and totally unstable with his constant interference. He&apos;s fired 14 managers since 1994 but has finally agreed to take a step back in the face of Meyer&apos;s success and the smart buys of sporting director Martin Bader. The manager has jokingly claimed that Roth is paying him in &quot;free rugs&quot; for his good deeds, but the president had better send over those lorries quickly: the witty, irony-loving Meyer is one of the few Bundesliga coaches who could actually change jobs voluntarily today. Results: Mainz 0 - 3 Schalke (thanks to the excellent Lincoln, who returned from his five-match suspension), Dormund 0 - 2 Bremen (thanks to Klose and Diego, who are back on form), Stuttgart 2 - 1 Hannover (thanks to a wonderful own goal by Zuraw and Balitsch, who bumped into each other on the goal-line), Bayern 2 - 1 Leverkusen, Cottbus 3 - 2 Wolfsburg, Gladbach 0 - 1 Hamburg, Bielefeld 2 - 4 Frankfurt, Bochum 1 - 3 Hertha, N\u00fcrnberg 1 - 0 Aachen.", "publicationDate": "2007-04-16T13:42:50Z", "tags": ["European club football", "Football", "Sport", "Bundesliga"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/apr/16/europeanfootball.sport", "title": "Bundesliga: Raphael Honigstein rounds up the weekend's action from Germany", "sentences": ["&quot;Springtime Happiness&quot; and &quot;Mister Lady&quot; might sound like two Bangkok massage parlours, but on Saturday the two were a winning combination in the EasyCredit-Stadion."]}, {"article": "The following apology was printed in the Observer&apos;s For the record column, Sunday April 29 2007 We apologise for some inaccuracies in the interview below. Shriver has lived in the UK for 20 years, but 12 of them were in Belfast, only eight in London, with interludes in Israel, Nairobi and Bangkok. Russian was only one course in her degree. And she did not change her name to Lionel to get &apos;more respect&apos;, but because: &apos;I was a tomboy. I grew up with brothers. So I chose a boy&apos;s name.&apos;  As I was interviewing Lionel Shriver in Foyles jazz cafe in London, a student was shooting 32 of his classmates and staff at Virginia Tech, and sure enough, next day, I heard someone say &apos;Another Kevin&apos;. It is a mark of how deeply Shriver&apos;s novel We Need to Talk About Kevin has penetrated that Kevin has become almost the generic term for campus killers. When her novel won the Orange Prize in 2005, having been rejected by 30 publishers, the big question was: Who is Lionel Shriver? A woman with a man&apos;s name, an American who had lived for years, unknown, in London, she seemed to arrive from nowhere to become overnight a literary star. But it turned out to be the usual story of overnight success - Kevin was actually her seventh novel, or eighth if you count one that was never published; she was 48 and had been writing for 20 &apos;very lean and very hard&apos; years before she found recognition. Print runs of her early novels were so small that they are now collectors&apos; items - a tatty copy of her first novel, The Female of the Species, will set you back \u00a383 on AbeBooks. Anyway, the arrival of The Post-Birthday World, her first novel after Kevin, is a huge publishing event. It&apos;s a what-if story, exploring two alternative narratives. In the first chapter the heroine Irina, a children&apos;s book illustrator, has dinner with an acquaintance, snooker player Ramsey, and he kisses her. The novel then pursues two possible outcomes - 1. she doesn&apos;t kiss him back, and goes home to her regular partner, Lawrence; or 2. she does kiss him back, leaves Lawrence, and marries him. It is a choice most women will recognise - is it better to be safe than sorry? Do you stay with the good but slightly dull partner you know or go for the sexual allure of the dark, handsome stranger you don&apos;t? But, as always with Shriver, the possibilities are considered with a moral seriousness worthy of George Eliot. She is simultaneously shocked and thrilled by the comparison, &apos;George Eliot! I&apos;ll certainly take that as a compliment!&apos; She is tiny and androgynous, with a thin, hard body, fierce eyebrows, muscled arms, calloused hands. She is wearing tomboy clothes and carrying a backpack - she looks as though she might have just shinned down from a treehouse but actually, she assures me, she cycled over from her flat in Borough (Southwark). She apologises that she has a slight hangover because she went to two literary parties last night - &apos;It was kind of weird. I used to go to the odd party, if I was invited - which I usually wasn&apos;t - and no one would talk to me, and I would end up hanging out with the catering staff and then I&apos;d sneak home. But last night it was all these people wanting to meet me, and I&apos;m thinking this is a dangerous thing to get addicted to because, as easily as that kind of attention arrives, it can be taken from you. &apos;I don&apos;t trust this stuff - it&apos;s so capricious! And I don&apos;t want to be dependent on it.&apos; But she is getting a surfeit of attention at the moment because she is in the middle of a four-month publicity tour. She was just back from America last week then &apos;doing Europe&apos; before setting off for Australia and New Zealand. Before Kevin she never had to do any interviews at all because nobody was interested. &apos;So whenever I&apos;m inclined to complain I try to remember how much I complained when I didn&apos;t have any publicity. But then I decided I&apos;m going to complain regardless, because I think it&apos;s one of life&apos;s great pleasures!&apos; How did the American tour go? &apos;They all asked: what is snooker?&apos; she laughs. Well, it was rather perverse to make her hero a snooker player, given that Americans have never heard of the game. She also makes him speak a bizarre Cockney argot complete with rhyming slang (&apos;septic tank&apos; for Yank) and strange locutions like &apos;Don&apos;t get your nose in a sling&apos; which are quite confusing for English readers let alone Americans. Why did she make him a snooker player? &apos;I like snooker. I&apos;ve been following it for about 15 years. I mean I&apos;m not glued to the set every tournament, I don&apos;t have that much disposable time, but it is very exciting to me. But of course it&apos;s not a book about snooker.&apos; No, quite. It&apos;s a book about relationships - but an exceptionally clear-eyed, unromantic take on the subject, with no happy ending. She started writing it when she fell in love with the man who is now her husband, jazz drummer Jeff Williams, which meant leaving the non-fiction writer she had lived with for almost a decade. She is careful what she says about her ex-partner: &apos;He&apos;s a very smart, wonderful man, but of course when you have been together that long, a relationship takes on a different character. But it was a productive relationship. I got a lot of work done and he was an astute editor of my work - that was one of the things I gave up - and I&apos;m very grateful to him. It was time well spent.&apos; But they never married, and this is one of Irina&apos;s beefs about Lawrence in the book - he says he&apos;ll marry her if she insists but he doesn&apos;t really see the point. Whereas Ramsey in the book, and presumably Jeff in real life, insist on marriage almost as a precondition of the relationship. (She married Jeff in Las Vegas, wearing her usual black T shirt and trainers.) I asked if this was her first marriage, and she screwed up her face and said, &apos;Not quite. I have to be factually accurate. You know the expression &apos;starter marriage&apos;? I had a starter marriage. I was way too young - 21 - it didn&apos;t last very long and I don&apos;t tell many people about it. He was someone I knew at university and I was more or less bullied into it by my parents. Which is another source of shame because I don&apos;t like to think of myself as being that malleable and eager to please.&apos; Anyway, she is now married to the jazz drummer. But a further complication is that he was previously married to the woman who used to be Shriver&apos;s agent, but who refused to handle Kevin on the grounds that she hated it. Everyone, Shriver says, assumes that she stole her agent&apos;s husband, perhaps even as revenge. &apos;But I didn&apos;t. They split up. But that&apos;s how I know him, and we kept in touch. That&apos;s all.&apos; However, she goes on, she ran into the ex-agent last night, at one of her literary parties, and it was only the second time she&apos;d seen her since the split. &apos;I had a feeling she&apos;d be there last night and she was. The first time we met after all this had happened, I remember bicycling home and castigating myself because I hadn&apos;t told her the one thing I felt I needed to tell her and that I could only say face to face, and it was that I never had anything to do with her husband while they were still together, nor even two years after they divorced. Nothing. So I said that last night - but I don&apos;t think she believed me. If you ever run into her,&apos; she laughs, &apos;rest assured she is one of my detractors!&apos; Given that Lionel Shriver is an internationally acclaimed author, we still know surprisingly little about her life. The potted biographies in her books give nothing away. But here is what we know so far. She was born on 18 May 1957 in North Carolina, the middle child of three with brothers on either side. Her father was a Presbyterian minister and later president of the Union Theological Seminary in New York, and she idolised him. Her mother was a homemaker until Lionel was 15 when she started working for the National Council on Churches. They were a deeply religious family - there were family prayers and Bible readings over dinner. She has said in the past: &apos;There is a very thin line in my family between God and my father.&apos; When she was 12 she announced that she wasn&apos;t going to church and &apos;My father literally dragged me into the car by my hair. And that carried on for a while and then finally, when I was 16, he couldn&apos;t do it any more.&apos; But although she is not religious herself, she says it rubbed off on her: &apos;You said something about my moral seriousness - I hope that doesn&apos;t make me sound like a terrible drag! But my father&apos;s speciality is ethics so in that sense it&apos;s gotten inside. I think the difference is that I&apos;m not satisfied by liberal platitudes. I like the hard case.&apos; Two important things happened when she was 15: first, she announced that she was changing her name from Margaret Ann to Lionel - she felt a boy&apos;s name would bring her more respect. And second, she suddenly looked normal for the first time. Up till then she&apos;d had hideous buck teeth, but at l5 they were finally fixed by braces. &apos;I know what it&apos;s like to be ugly, to be unsightly, to be someone whom others make fun of, and in retrospect I&apos;m grateful. It&apos;s a bit like having been a crashing failure as a novelist for so many years - it&apos;s important information for me to have. When I see someone else who for one reason or another is going to attract that kind of ridicule or neglect - sometimes it&apos;s more passive than ridicule but it&apos;s still painful - I&apos;m not thinking Oh they&apos;re ugly! It&apos;s more, oh, poor thing. And that&apos;s valuable to me. Having had that experience of being discriminated against, it makes you realise how conditional are the world&apos;s affections.&apos; She spent her twenties doing a degree in Russian and English at Columbia University, and then running a catering company in New York, while also teaching freshmen&apos;s courses and remedial English in the south Bronx. She lived in Belfast, Israel, Nairobi and Thailand before settling in London 20 years ago. She published her first novel when she was 30 and another five before the breakthrough with Kevin. They all achieved respectful reviews but minimal sales, and she supported herself by writing for the Economist and the Guardian. In her mid-thirties she fell in love with the non-fiction writer with whom she lived for 10 years. But her mother warned her not to have children: &apos;She said it would transform our relationship and the implication was - not for the better.&apos; Anyway, she didn&apos;t want children, but in her early forties, with time running out, she started thinking again about motherhood - and the result was Kevin, possibly the scariest take on motherhood ever devised. (What if your child becomes a campus killer?) If she had had success earlier, would she have been more willing to have children? &apos;That&apos;s astute,&apos; she concedes. &apos;I think one of the reasons why I never got round to seriously entertaining the idea of having kids is that I was still working on the project I started out on - establishing myself as a novelist - and that produced an extended adolescence.&apos; In 2005 she wrote a very odd article in the Guardian saying that she was fed up with being seen as &apos;the Anti-Mom&apos;; she thought women should have children; she was alarmed by how fast fertility rates are declining in Europe. I told her - flippantly - that her argument seemed to be that other women should have children in order to pay her pension and to stop Europeans being outnumbered by immigrants. I meant it as a joke but she took it very badly indeed: &apos;My message was positive - to pervert it is wicked. I was trying to say something that most people just wouldn&apos;t try to say because of the risk of being misinterpreted that way. That&apos;s the kind of self-censorship that we do all the time. But I&apos;m interested in issues that are difficult. I&apos;m very interested in the issue of immigration - expect more from me on this. Because there comes a point where it isn&apos;t the more the merrier, there&apos;s a tipping point where a population that is being inundated begins to get resentful.&apos; In fact, she partly tackled the subject in her (very weird) fourth novel, Game Control, and tells me she has been &apos;obsessed&apos; with demography since she was 15. &apos;When I was growing up and saying I don&apos;t want to have kids,&apos; she goes on, &apos;I felt like a maverick, but when I reached my late thirties, early forties I realised I wasn&apos;t and that if you looked at the statistics - I&apos;ve been keeping track of fertility rates all over the world - I was alarmed. And I&apos;m still alarmed. That&apos;s what that article was trying to say: do as I say not as I did. It&apos;s not good, it&apos;s not healthy for the society and for us as individuals, to just be thinking, &quot;Let&apos;s go on lots of holidays and not bother with kids.&quot; But for me it&apos;s too late - I turn 50 next month.&apos; Her life has changed surprisingly little since she won the Orange Prize. The prize itself was \u00a330,000 but the real value was in hugely enhanced book sales - 600,000 in the UK alone. Yet she still lives in the same rented flat in Southwark - shouldn&apos;t she be buying somewhere? &apos;No, I&apos;m too much of a coward! Large amounts of money scare the hell out of me. And the thought of going around looking at property is odious, your life passes before your eyes and you feel a bit like dying.&apos; She still cycles everywhere, still buys her clothes in charity shops, still refuses to have a mobile phone. &apos;It&apos;s so bad that I have virtually no tax deductions because I don&apos;t spend any money. I don&apos;t go out to eat because I like my own cooking - nobody makes it hot enough for my taste and if I cook at home I can cram it full of chillies. I don&apos;t keep the heat on during the day, even in winter [which perhaps explains why she suffers from Reynaud&apos;s disease - poor circulation - and has to wear gloves all the time]. Other people seem to regard these little habits as peculiar. I don&apos;t regard them as peculiar. But I suppose I am bloody-minded about cycling everywhere. I bicycled to those parties last night. I wore these clothes. I&apos;m also very frugal about laundry because I don&apos;t like to do it, so I wear the same clothes all week.&apos; Surely now she can afford to loosen up a bit? &apos;It&apos;s very ingrained, and it turns out that I don&apos;t want to buy anything. Habits I have pursued out of necessity, I now realise I like. I like going to thrift shops more than I enjoy going to, say, John Lewis. I&apos;m not interested in their stuff. I like my old pots and pans, they have character. I like keeping my grains in old Horlicks jars. I like Horlicks jars.&apos; And of course she saves rubber bands, so at last I can get the answer to a question that has bothered me all my life - what are you meant to do with them? &apos;I use them to keep things wrapped up in the freezer. I mean I&apos;m not surrounded by huge binliners full of rubber bands! But I&apos;m pretty good about recycling, and for me it&apos;s not to do with saving the planet, it has to do with a natural desire to save, to use, to re-use. I am sparing about materials. And maybe I&apos;m the same way about my life and my work - very frugal, trying to use everything. I know that I have ended up eccentric, but I like it that way.&apos; Back pages Born Margaret Ann Shriver, 18 May 1957, Gastonia, North Carolina, to a Presbyterian minister father and full-time mother who was also a poet, political campaigner and theology academic.

Endless stretches of indulgent, beach-fuelled luxury have been replaced by early mornings, late nights and unhealthy team-room snacking. The contrast should be unbearably depressing; I always expect a crushing sense of doom to hit me in the days and weeks after a blissful holiday break. But it never seems to strike and this time is no different. Maintaining a ceaseless reservoir of boundless enthusiasm is, of course, one of the secrets to success as a constant business traveller. Those of a pill-popping, nervous disposition don&apos;t cope well with delayed flights, infuriating clients and the inevitable disappointment of loved ones once the idyllic sojourn is over.  I have always found it the height of indulgent immaturity to complain about a return to hard labour. Imagine how your colleagues feel? You&apos;ve just spent a week on a beach and yet you&apos;re the one sniffing about how hard you have to work and what a frightful injustice that is. Imagine how the tired, beat-up regular tube commuter feels? If you don&apos;t enjoy your job \u2013 the jetsetting, intellectual stimulation, healthy pay packet and regular escapes \u2013 then no one will. So (in case you do) stop complaining and smell the coffee: your holiday was great and your work is but a thrilling privilege. Averting the crushing sense of doom is clearly a trick of the mind, but there is one other helpful contributor: your &quot;holiday strategy&quot; (you&apos;ll forgive the use of business lingo, I&apos;m sure). Any holiday strategy consists of three decisions. When should I go? How often should I go? And where should I go? The &quot;when&quot;, it seems to me, is fairly irrelevant to a happy return to work. Some of us like to go when it&apos;s cold in the UK; others during school holidays; others when most of our colleagues are also away. Perhaps the last helps you overcome that sense of guilt over being away but it can, with a pessimist&apos;s attitude, still make you feel like a toyless kid on your return.  The &quot;how often&quot;, though, I&apos;m convinced is critical. It wasn&apos;t so long ago that we went on &quot;long&quot; holidays. Two, stretched-out weeks on the French Riviera midway through the year might be followed by two weeks at a Florida theme park at Christmas. This, it seems to your humble diarist, is a catastrophic error. Post-holiday blues are, even for the most avowed lover of their profession, a near certainty if the next one is a full six months away. In this era of accessible travel \u2013 BA has 11, yes 11, flights to New York every day \u2013 why would you use your hardearned 25 days of holiday in such wasteful fashion?  Take four week-long breaks (for example); use the bank holidays we are blessed with to head off for a long weekend; and spread your days off through the year to give your life a balanced work-rest-work-rest pattern. This is a critical part of your holiday strategy \u2013 and your family and friends will love you for it. The &quot;where&quot; is an even more vexing issue for those who spend much of their lives at 35,000 feet or on foreign shores. I know countless colleagues who steer clear of flying \u2013 and sometimes even of countries other than their own \u2013 to escape the reality of their working lives. This is an understandable phenomenon and one for which you can&apos;t help feeling a morsel of sympathy: you can just about see how a train journey to Solihull may be a tempting change from a plane journey to Milan. In my view however, it&apos;s a monumental error. Business travel \u2013 to fulfill an obligation \u2013 and personal travel \u2013 to satisfy a sense of curiosity and adventure \u2013 should not be conflated. Spending your weeks in the Ruhrgebiet doesn&apos;t make Rio, Hawaii, Antigua, Mumbai or Bangkok any less exciting. And allowing the conflation to affect your loved ones is unacceptable: foisting a British train on your kids may scar them for life.  So, I say, put aside your instinctive aversion to yet more travel and be adventurous. Go and do the Inca trail; spend a weekend eating, drinking and pretending to be glacially hip in New York; explore the ancient and modern wonders of Istanbul; lounge on a white sandy beach in the Maldives or on a black sandy beach in Kerala; exhaust yourself skiing in Whistler or Aspen; or drive for hours to reach a vineyard in Western Australia; and if you take the train, make it the Trans-Siberian. The options are endless. And variety is the key to getting both the &quot;how often&quot; and &quot;where&quot; questions right.  If you go on four, scintillating, thoroughly different holidays through a calendar year, each return to the treadmill will (I promise) be painless. You never know, with the next holiday a few months away and your team happy to see you return, it might even be a touch joyous.  Happy holidays to all of you. I&apos;m back, as ever, in a fortnight.

The woman, a New Yorker fresh out of college, is teaching English as a foreign language to children in Bangkok. The man has travelled in the other direction - a native of Bangkok, he has moved to Ithaca, a dozy little town in the north of New York state, to study English literature at the university there. July 2 was an ordinary Wednesday, until the Thai government devalued its currency. By the end of the day the baht had plummeted and within weeks it was worth barely half its value against the dollar. The world came to remember that day as the start of the Asian financial crisis. But for the two people in our story the event had a more personal significance. The woman, who had been leading a modest life on a teacher&apos;s salary paid in dollars, suddenly found herself hugely wealthy compared with her Thai hosts. The man was propelled in the other direction: into instant and humiliating penury. The crash of the baht is a strange place to start exploring the state of the modern American novel. But the man and the woman are among the most promising young American writers today. And they both remember that Wednesday as a key experience that helped shape why and what they write. Nell Freudenberger, the New Yorker, says the crash made her feel for the first time that she had to justify herself as a rich American among people now much poorer than herself - a cultural dislocation that has suffused her stories ever since. Rattawut Lapcharoensap says it turned him overnight from being a middle-class student to somebody without enough money to eat, surrounded by affluent Americans - a tension that pulses through his work. For two such polar opposites, they have ended up in a surprisingly similar place. They are both on the list of 21 writers crowned by the literary magazine Granta as the best young American novelists. It is Granta&apos;s second go at the US landscape, the last being in 1996 when it impressively plucked out such names as Jonathan Franzen and David Guterson, who have gone on to great things. The list business is not as sparklingly new as it was when Granta sat in judgment on young British novelists for the first time in 1983 (Amis, Rushdie, McEwan). But it continues to fascinate, partly because it holds the promise of hours of good reading, and partly because by taking snapshots every 10 years the lists highlight the way the novelist&apos;s eye has shifted focus over time. What leaps out of the new list, as the Granta judges have commented, is a heavy emphasis on things foreign. Where are the urban wastelands through which John Updike&apos;s Rabbit ran? Where are the suburbs that held the self-doubting realtors of Richard Ford, or the squabbling New Jerseyites of Philip Roth? Instead, the focus of the new list falls neatly into the two camps to emerge from the crisis of July 2. There are those like Freudenberger who write about the clash of cultures when Americans go abroad, and those like Lapcharoensap who are first-generation Americans writing about the homelands they left behind. &quot;The suburbs as a subject matter has been exhausted,&quot; says Edmund White, one of the Granta judges. &quot;What&apos;s impressive about this list is that there are so many different voices reflecting the true multiculturalism of the society here.&quot; Despite the disparities in their birthplaces and in the settings they chose for their tales, the six writers profiled here out of the 21 agree on one thing: in the last analysis, differences of voice and location are cosmetic; what matters most are the characters they give birth to and the stories they have to tell. Olga Grushin, 35Washington The protagonist of Olga Grushin&apos;s first novel, The Dream Life of Sukhanov, is a Soviet equivalent of Faust who has sold his soul to the system, destroying his own youthful dreams by serving the regime in return for a comfortable life. The character is a mirror image of Grushin&apos;s own father, a sociologist blacklisted in 1976, forcing them to quit Moscow for Prague. The book is a powerful portrayal of the price people pay in compromising their ambitions, written in prose that is so fluent few would realise that English is the author&apos;s third language, after Russian and Czech. Grushin came to the US in 1989, to Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, the first Soviet citizen to take up an undergraduate course in the US. A dual citizen since 2003, from day one she says she felt strangely at home in America. She embraced baseball and football and went horse riding in Tennessee. &quot;For me, that was as exotic as could be.&quot; After finishing college she moved to Washington, where she still lives with her American husband and three-year-old son. For many years Grushin wrote fiction in Russian during every spare moment she had. But about the time of her move to Washington she began writing in English, first translating her stories from Russian and then composing directly in her adopted tongue. Sukhanov came to her as a character when she was a teenager, but it was only after she had lived for several years in the US that this overtly Russian figure moved her to write the novel. &quot;It dawned on me that the story of Sukhanov was not only a tragic historical tale specific to Russia, but also one with great relevance to people&apos;s lives in America. People here often have to face the same dilemma: do they pursue a comfortable living or do they follow their heart&apos;s desires?&quot; The same was true of Grushin, who came close to entering the legal profession in Washington but opted instead for a far less secure future as a writer. She chose the opposite path to Sukhanov. So far the gamble is working. Gabe Hudson, 35Princeton, New Jersey Gabe Hudson is not your average-looking novelist. Standing 6ft 4in tall, he has the steely eyes of a coyote and a crew cut as severe as the crops they dish out in Marine Corps. But then he did spend four years in the late 80s and early 90s as what he calls a &quot;ground pounder&quot;, or rifleman, in the marine reserves, enduring boot camp in San Diego and intense combat training. He narrowly missed service in the first Gulf war in Iraq. Hudson comes from an affluent, largely white neighbourhood in Austin, Texas, hardly the natural recruiting soil for the marines (or novelists for that matter). Instilled with a passion for reading while very young - his father read him Moby Dick and Wallace Stevens poems from the age of four - he says he drew from Cormac McCarthy&apos;s Blood Meridian the conviction that a young man had to see the world and find adventure. His experiences in the corps, and his encounters with fellow recruits from all racial and social backgrounds, have provided him with rich literary fodder ever since. &quot;The beauty of the marines was that it was totally democratic - once they shave your head and put you in uniform you realise the similarities between you. In the corps, everybody bleeds green.&quot; His first book, Dear Mr President, is a collection of short stories exploring the strains put on the troops during and after the first Gulf war. His characters suffer from post-traumatic stress-like symptoms and the ravages of Gulf war syndrome. The stories contain strong characters and vivid narratives, layered with surreal imagery. There is the lance corporal who finds a perfectly shaped human ear growing out of his ribs; and the transvestite marine whose body is occupied by the spirit of his dead daughter. The writing ripples with violence, credibly depicted with the benefit of Hudson&apos;s own days as a scrapping marine. &quot;At weekends we would look for fights. It was fun for me,&quot; he admits, adding quickly: &quot;I was much younger then; I&apos;m very calm now.&quot; Today Hudson shares an office with Edmund White at Princeton, where he teaches creative writing. Joyce Carol Oates has an office over the corridor. He is writing more war fiction, this time a novel set in Vietnam with the working title American Buddha. Engaged to a Vietnamese woman, he is weighing up whether to move to Seoul, where he has been offered a professorship in creative writing. The lust for adventure that took him into the marines, it seems, still runs strong. Jonathan Safran Foer, 30Brooklyn, currently resides in Berlin Of all the 21 names on Granta&apos;s list, Jonathan Safran Foer is the best known. His Everything Is Illuminated won the Guardian First Book prize in 2002, he was hailed by Time as a wunderkind and the film rights were sold even before he had finished writing it. His second novel, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, was received almost as breathlessly. With all that credit banked by the age of 30, you might expect to find the novelist sitting back a little. Not at all. The daily fight, he says, with the blank screen and the empty page is as hard now as when he started out. &quot;I always think it&apos;s reached the maximum of bad until I speak to other writers,&quot; he says. He recently met Jonathan Franzen, one of the hits of the 1996 Granta list: &quot;He sounded worse than I felt.&quot; His current battle is to divine the story for his next novel. He&apos;s written a book&apos;s worth of first pages, but nothing yet feels right. As he waits for inspiration, he is busy writing a non-fiction book about the relationship between America and the meat it eats. &quot;Meat is probably the No 1 most unappealing topic in the world,&quot; he says with the self-denigrating wit that suffuses his novels, adding that he hopes his stylised writing will be some recompense for readers. He is living temporarily in Berlin on a scholarship from the American Academy, together with his wife Nicole Krauss - a fellow writer who also makes it on to the Granta list. Is their dual namecheck odd? &quot;Not as odd as if only one of us had been on the list; that would have been awkward.&quot; Safran Foer is the kind of writer who resists attempts to label his work or analyse it, saying literature must have a uselessness if it is to be art. He says that Everything Is Illuminated was about the American experience, despite its east European setting, and though Extremely Loud wears September 11 on its sleeve, in his view it is much more about the most fertile ground that he has as a novelist: family. His own - he and Krauss have an infant son - gives him comfort in dark moments: &quot;I am grateful for family. It makes artistic failure seem more bearable.&quot; Nell Freudenberger, 31Manhattan Several of the Granta judges pointed to a new outward-looking focus among the younger generation of American novelists, towards the wider world beyond America&apos;s borders, or what Edmund White dubbed the &quot;Peace Corps novel&quot;. Nell Freudenberger illustrates that tendency. Brought up in New York and LA within a bookish family (her father is a screenwriter), she was always interested in writing but dismissive of the America of the 80s - her formative decade - as source material for literature. &quot;I never thought I would be interested in writing about America from the inside, because to my mind there wasn&apos;t a lot to write about - all this commercialism, a little bit of punk rock. The whole time I was growing up I remember thinking everything exciting about my country happened in the past, in my parents&apos; generation, the 60s.&quot; What unlocked her creative talents were lengthy visits in her early 20s to India and Thailand, where she experienced that alienating effect of sudden wealth when the currency collapsed. Many Asian people she met embraced the American dream with more gusto than most Americans, yet were deeply critical of US influence on the world, a paradox that she has played with in her writing. Her first book, a collection of short stories called Lucky Girls, draws heavily on cultural distances between Americans abroad and their Asian hosts. Her second work, a novel, The Dissident, places a fake Chinese rebel artist in a comfortable though troubled family in Los Angeles. The &quot;foreignness&quot; of the writing is deceptive: the more you read, the more classically American her themes appear - disorientation, loss, adultery, longing. &quot;At first I asked myself what right had I to write about India, a country that had so many of its own great writers. Only later did I realise that I wasn&apos;t writing about India at all, but about what it is to be American.&quot; ZZ Packer, 34San Francisco Bay area It has taken a long time, in ZZ Packer&apos;s view, for African-American writers to be accepted into the mainstream of American literature. No matter how fine the work of James Baldwin or Alice Walker, their work was still seen as somehow exotic, a tour into an unfamiliar world for the largely white reading public. Today, black Americans are recognised as quintessential to America. That is reflected in Packer&apos;s description of herself as a writer who is black, rather than someone who produces &quot;black writing&quot;. Race runs through her first volume of short stories, Drinking Coffee Elsewhere, but in unexpected ways. A troop of black Brownies accuses a white group of racism, only to cringe with embarrassment when they realise the girls have learning difficulties. In another tale she describes the Million Man March on Washington through the eyes of a black teenager dragged there by his hopeless drunken father. Of the six Granta novelists profiled here, Packer is the most overtly &quot;American&quot; in her subject matter. She revels in the social and physical landscape of her own country. &quot;For now, that&apos;s where I am,&quot; she says. &quot;For all its flaws, America is still to me an interesting place and I can keep mining it.&quot; She is currently writing a second draft of her first novel, with the working title The Thousands. It focuses on the legion of forgotten black men and women of the west, challenging the myth of the stoic white cowboy. It is peopled with black and Mexican frontiersmen, as well as the Buffalo Soldiers, the black cavalry regiments formed after the civil war. On her desk a photograph is propped up of Nat Love, one of the most famous black cowboys. The idea of the book emerged out of discussions with her grandmother about their family origins as share croppers in Mississippi and later Kentucky. The novel has been in the offing for more than seven years and runs to 600 pages. The Granta list has further upped the stakes, she fears: &quot;You don&apos;t get to write a first novel twice, so this had better be good.&quot; Rattawut Lapcharoensap, 28Brooklyn When Rattawut Lapcharoensap was told he was one of the Granta winners, his reaction was bemusement. He has never written a novel, and though he is a US citizen, having been born in Chicago, he would not naturally describe hmself as American. In fact A, as friend and family call him (it&apos;s a derivation of his childhood nickname Peek-a-Boo, but he&apos;s keen we don&apos;t dwell on that), would not naturally describe himself as anything. His life has been spent flitting between the US and Bangkok, from which his parents, leftist activists, temporarily fled to the US in the late 70s. He learned English as a second language at school, but since the age of 17 has been living in New York - initially upstate, where the baht crisis struck him, and now in the city. His personal mindset, and his imaginative life as a creative writer, are both dominated by a sense of rootlessness. &quot;I am neither at home nor abroad in any place I&apos;ve ever lived. In Thailand I&apos;m never Thai enough, and here in America I&apos;m one of a new generation coming in. That&apos;s pretty traumatising and disorienting.&quot; His first book of short stories, Sightseeing, echoes with cultural loneliness, from the elderly and disabled American man who lives with his son, Thai daughter-in-law and grandchildren whom he cannot understand, to the story about the Thai teenager who serially falls in love with &quot;farang&quot; tourist women, only to be serially disappointed. A writes in English, despite it being his second language. He has tried in Thai, with embarrassing results, he says. Instead, he uses Americanisms to try to capture the humour and grittiness of the street talk of his Bangkok childhood - a strange cultural fusion that he pulls off to remarkable effect. The downside is that those he holds most dear are not able to share in his literary success. His mother has started reading his book several times. She has yet to finish it. \u00b7 Granta 97: Best of Young American Novelists 2 is published on May 10, price \u00a312.99.

Totally like algebra. And he&apos;s the total opposite, Antony. He&apos;s kind of more esoteric and feeling his ancestors singing through him - it&apos;s more about humans. For me, it&apos;s not about humans. In a weird way it&apos;s about maths and physics. Sorry,&quot; she adds, sitting back down again, &quot;I got a bit excited.&quot; There is a gleefully unrestrained air to Bj\u00f6rk today. As she talks, she squirms and fidgets and pulls at her face. She speaks like someone doing a jigsaw puzzle, feeling the shape of each word before she places it in a sentence, and her voice ripples between Icelandic and cockney and American. She is discussing her new record, Volta, the latest episode in a recording career lasting 30 years (she recorded her first album aged 11). After the rarefied atmosphere of albums such as Vespertine (2001) and Medulla (2004), records that seemed so fine-spun as to be &quot;like filigree, mosaic, like embroidery&quot;, Volta sounds like a re-engagement with the outside world. The insular nature of the previous two records was the result of time she spent at home following the birth of her second child, Isadora. &quot;I was working for a few years with the luxury of having a laptop and not having to be in studios,&quot; she explains, &quot;if you&apos;re having a child, it&apos;s very convenient, you travel a little bit and you work a little bit, so you don&apos;t have to leave, you know? So my driving force for the beginning of this album was maybe I had a little bit of cabin fever. My girl was going to kindergarten, so I was ready to get out a little bit.&quot; Bj\u00f6rk will certainly be getting out a little bit this year, embarking on a huge world tour to promote the new album. &quot;We&apos;d almost planned the tour before the album release,&quot; she says, animatedly, &quot;because I was excited about forming the band and playing live and just physically being with the musicians around me and feeling it with my body, as opposed to being in a room and noodling with something forever, and putting musicians in a song that I&apos;ve never actually physically met.&quot; Indeed, there is a sense of physicality to Volta, both lyrically and musically. Even instruments - the kora, the pipa, the clavichord - were chosen to bring a certain earthiness. &quot;The clavichord, it&apos;s like the ancestor of the harpsichord,&quot; she darts on, &quot;so when you play it, it sort of goes duuuuunnnnnngh, so those three instruments have that in common, a kind of dirty sound. When I did Vespertine, there were a lot of instruments like that, but they were pretty clean: harps and music boxes and glockenspiels.&quot; These are, perhaps, the two sides of Bj\u00f6rk. &quot;Yes I think I&apos;m probably both,&quot; she says after some consideration. &quot;I&apos;m like romantic and sort of old-fashioned, and part of me is very stubborn, and I&apos;m really loyal. So I have a lot of solid stuff. But the other half of me is totally restless, and I get really easily bored. And maybe this album is also about that.&quot; One track on Volta sums this up best: Wanderlust begins with the sound of water, a ship&apos;s horn, and seagulls, before Bj\u00f6rk sings: &quot;I have lost my origin/ And I don&apos;t want to find it again/ Rather sailing into nature&apos;s laws/ And be held by ocean&apos;s paws,&quot; before washing out again in a tide of &quot;restless relentlessly, restless relentlessly, restless relentlessly&quot;. Does she regard the sea as somehow emblematic of her restlessness? She smiles brightly and bobs her head. &quot;I&apos;ve been trying to live in Manhattan,&quot; she says, &quot;and I do love it but it&apos;s been complicated for me because I get very claustrophobic. And so we bought a boat, so you always have that option that you can just sail out of it. So it&apos;s more like that&apos;s my home, the boat.&quot; Volta also seems to suggest a new engagement with world politics, with songs about suicide bombers and paratroopers and declarations of independence. Bj\u00f6rk once said she never votes, but she admits she has felt a political reawakening of late. &quot;All my friends, 10 years ago or five years ago we&apos;d have a dinner, eat at someone&apos;s house, have some wine or whatever, and we&apos;d never talk about politics. Ever. But now, people talk.&quot; Her reconnection to world events in part began on Boxing Day 2005. Following the tsunami in Indonesia, Bj\u00f6rk recorded an album of fans&apos; remixes of her single Army of Me, donating the proceeds to Unicef. A year later, she was invited to visit the region and found &quot;they were still just digging in the earth and finding bones and dresses of relatives&quot;, an image that you suspect might have occasioned her desire for the dirty sound of the clavichord. She flew from Indonesia straight to New York, to a studio session with the producer Timbaland, and immediately wrote the song Earth Intruders. &quot;It just came like a tsunami out of my mouth,&quot; she says, sounding still faintly surprised, &quot;and lyrically it&apos;s probably the most chaotic song that I&apos;ve ever written, it sort of doesn&apos;t make sense.&quot; It is a marching song, &quot;Bundle of bombardiers,&quot; it insists, &quot;We are the canoneers/ Apache voodoo.&quot; She shakes her head a little, rubs her nose. &quot;I tried to edit it afterwards to fix it and make logic out of it,&quot; she says, &quot;but it&apos;s just like chaos.&quot; She is also rather fierce on the subject of Iceland. &quot;It is my home, I still spend half my time there and I always will, but it is complicated, that identity thing.&quot; On Debut, her first solo album, she says that perhaps she was making a statement: &quot;That I could be very Icelandic but I could still be global. You don&apos;t have to pick one or the other, and then you&apos;re having an affair.&quot; Nevertheless, the rest of the world has insisted upon portraying her as some sort of kooky woodland creature. It interests her, she says, &quot;this marketing of what is Icelandic, this whole elfin thing, and that we are this naive race. And I&apos;m just against it.&quot; Her face curls up grumpily. &quot;And I never said in the press that I saw elves. I never did see elves. Tolkien based his Lord of the Rings on Iceland and maybe that exists in the imagination of a lot of English-speaking people, so maybe it&apos;s English-speaking people projecting that on to Iceland. &quot; And yet Iceland is changing. &quot;Now they&apos;ve made the biggest dam in the world and the biggest aluminium factory, and in the next five years, they&apos;re going to build five more. So Iceland, that used to be the biggest untouched area in Europe, in the space of five or 10 years is going to be like Frankfurt.&quot; It infuriates her. &quot;It seems to me if Iceland wants to make tons of money and wants to work universally, the last thing it should do is destroy its nature. You don&apos;t need a genius to work that one out. And yet the first thing they do when they get money and independence is say &apos;Let&apos;s destroy our country!&apos;&quot; She falls into a ruminative silence and pulls at her dress. &quot;So maybe this whole album being about the ocean is also speculations on all that,&quot; she says finally, calmly. &quot;And maybe just being a bit exhausted with nationalism.&quot; Musicians of many nationalities appear on Volta: Toumani Diabete, the Malian kora player; the Congolese band Konono No1; Min Xiao-Fen, the Chinese pipa player; a 10-piece female brass section from Iceland; and the Americans - drummers Chris Corsano and Brian Chippendale, singer Antony Hegarty, and producers Timbaland and Mark Bell. &quot;There seemed to be a lot of that thing happening on the album where ... I don&apos;t know how to say it because when you say it, it sounds banal, but there were a lot of arrows pointing at north Africa. At the same time not in a ...&quot; She flounders a little, desperate, perhaps not to sound like a colonialist. Or Sting. &quot;Coming from a place like Iceland,&quot; she explains, &quot;I always really sympathise with people from other nationalities that have that same luggage, you know? So I&apos;d be very proud if somebody from Africa would tell me that the references on this album are on an equal level, not as sort of an exotic &apos;Here&apos;s a tiger I shot and put it on the wall&apos; sort of thing.&quot; It is arguably the beats that differentiate Volta from Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s earlier albums. &quot;With albums like Homogenic and Vespertine and even Medulla, the first thing I knew was the beats,&quot; she nods. &quot;So I went ahead with Homogenic and got a programmer and just said OK, we&apos;re gonna do distorted beats, and we just did a library of beats that sounded like they&apos;re coming from an eruption, like volcanic. And then afterwards I wrote the songs and we would say, &apos;Oh let&apos;s put beat 73 in the chorus&apos; or &apos;Let&apos;s put beat 11 in the middle eight.&apos; I knew it was a universe that happens in the virtual reality, similar to how the thought process is - quite electric and static and whispery voices and beats that kind of crackle. There&apos;s always the side of the process where you sit down and you&apos;re like little archaeologists, digging out little things and putting them in little boxes. But with this album, beats kind of came last.&quot; There was no library of beats on Volta; the process was much freer, more impulsive. &quot;The thing with electronic beats is you have to always put them to a grid, like a computer grid,&quot; she explains. &quot;So it&apos;s always dum dum dum,&quot; she beats the table several rhythmical times, &quot;so it&apos;s mechanical.&quot; When she first heard Konono No 1, she realised they were doing something entirely different. &quot;There they were doing electronic music, but it wasn&apos;t to that grid, so all the electronic nerds like me went berserk when that record came out. I knew I wanted to work with them.&quot; Later, she drafted in Corsano, known for his work with Sonic Youth, and Chippendale, from the experimental duo Lightning Bolt. &quot;They are kind of the opposite sides of the same coin,&quot; she smiles. &quot;Chris Corsano plays very butterfly, very light, and Brian Chippendale&apos;s very ...&quot; she scrunches up her face and mimes some furious drumming. &quot;I&apos;ve never done this before, it was so fun - they didn&apos;t hear any music beforehand, they just went in a room and heard a song and they just reacted to it.&quot; She shrugs. &quot;But they come from this scene where it&apos;s all about improvisation and just jumping off a cliff every time.&quot; She asked Hegarty to sing on two tracks, the cinematic sweep of Dull Flame of Desire, and My Juvenile, &quot;a song about my teenage son and the conversation you have in your head. I haven&apos;t met a parent who doesn&apos;t carry guilt.&quot; She had already performed two sets of vocals, one as the parent, the other as &quot;the conscience&quot; before asking Hegarty to perform the latter role. &quot;So the backing vocals were sort of like Jiminy Cricket and the main voice was sort of a Pinocchio,&quot; she explains blithely. &quot;Jiminy Cricket is going, &apos;You know you did your best, don&apos;t worry about it,&apos; and being soothing. And Antony&apos;s naturally like that, he&apos;s really soothing.&quot; You wonder how Bj\u00f6rk communicates with these collaborators, with all her talk of Jiminy Cricket and butterflies and algebra. Do they grasp her dreams of waves of people and George Bush&apos;s floor tiles, or understand her quoting EE Cummings? The joy and the genius of Bj\u00f6rk has always been that she communicates in an unexpected, unconventional yet entirely eloquent manner. &quot;I think of the tracks as characters, like my friends,&quot; she says now. &quot;I get really, &apos;This is the track with lilies that are dying, past their prime, and black and kinda sexual,&apos; or whatever. And then another track is the happy one with all the kites and childlike energy. So I&apos;m pretty stubborn, once a track is that character, I will stay with that character. I&apos;ll say things like, &apos;No no no, this is not a pink song. It&apos;s more like this section is narrow and the chorus is wide, there&apos;s a lot of space.&apos;&quot; She looks towards the street again and smiles. &quot;I can stop them if they&apos;re going down the wrong road.&quot; Volta&apos;s predecessors: The album-by-album guide to Bj\u00f6rk Debut (1993) Seduced by dance beats, Bj\u00f6rk abandoned the indie-rock of her previous band, the Sugarcubes, and embraced post-acid house club culture, abetted by Soul II Soul producer Nellee Hooper. Debut spawned playful hits such as Human Behaviour and Big Time Sensuality, and became a defining album of the early 1990s. Post (1995) The electronic and orchestral Post saw her recruit techno faces such as Howie B, Graham Massey (of 808 State) and Tricky. Its defining moment was It&apos;s Oh So Quiet, a vivacious mugging of a 1948 show tune and Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s biggest chart hit to date. Homogenic (1997) As fame took its toll on Bj\u00f6rk - she attacked a journalist in Bangkok in 1996, and was shocked when obsessed US fan Ricardo Lopez posted her a letter bomb before killing himself - she began a partial retreat from the mainstream. Experimental in tone and texture, the dark-hued Homogenic also betrayed the drum&apos;n&apos;bass influence of her then-lover, Goldie. Vespertine (2001) After her turn in Lars von Trier&apos;s Dancer in the Dark yielded the soundtrack album Selmasongs (2000), Bj\u00f6rk returned with her most introspective and intimate record. Composed on a laptop, Vespertine was decidedly short on tunes your postman might whistle. Medulla (2004) Medulla found Bj\u00f6rk eschewing instruments and roping in beatboxers and Inuit throat singers to explore the primal extremes of the human voice. Yet it sounded like the Sugababes next to the abstract noises of Drawing Restraint 9, the 2005 soundtrack to the film she made with partner Matthew Barney. \u00b7 Ian Gittins is the author of Human Behaviour: The Stories Behind Every Song by Bj\u00f6rk (Carlton). \u00b7 Volta is released on May 7 on One Little Indian", "publicationDate": "2007-04-27T09:58:31Z", "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/apr/27/popandrock3", "title": "'I had a little bit of cabin fever'", "sentences": ["Homogenic (1997) As fame took its toll on Bj\u00f6rk - she attacked a journalist in Bangkok in 1996, and was shocked when obsessed US fan Ricardo Lopez posted her a letter bomb before killing himself - she began a partial retreat from the mainstream."]}, {"article": "It looks like no expense has been spared on this Korean action movie that flits from Seoul to Bangkok to Vladivostok, cramming in big action scenes at every opportunity.

Climate change could be stopped in its tracks using existing technology, but only if politicians do more to force businesses and individuals to take action. The UN study will conclude that mankind has the knowhow to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 26bn tonnes by 2030 - more than enough to limit the expected temperature rise across the planet to 2-3C. Such a move would cost the world economy billions of pounds over the next two decades, but this could be recouped by savings due to the health benefits of lower levels of air pollution. Cheaper solutions could bring down emissions to 1990 levels, but that would still see average temperatures rise by as much as 4C this century, with devastating consequences for wildlife, agriculture and the availability of water. Measures The report, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), will say a range of measures can be introduced across the energy supply, transport, buildings, agriculture and forestry, industry and waste sectors. The best way to limit future emissions is to focus on clean development in developing countries. The report, the third this year from the IPCC, looks at ways to tackle global warming and is due to be released in Bangkok on Friday. The previous two reports analysed the science of climate change and its likely impacts. Together, the three reports will underpin international negotiations on a new treaty to regulate greenhouse gas emissions to replace the Kyoto protocol. The summary of the new report, a draft of which has been obtained by the Guardian, says: &quot;It is technically and economically feasible to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere ... provided that incentives are in place to further develop and implement a range of mitigation technologies.&quot; It says global emissions need to peak &quot;within the next two decades&quot; and that the problem is now more serious and requires &quot;more stringent mitigation&quot; than when the IPCC last reported in 2001. Reductions Rachel Warren, of the Cambridge University&apos;s Centre for Climate Change Mitigation Research who helped to write the report, said: &quot;We have to reduce our emissions, and the technology to do that already exists or can be commercialised in the coming decades. We need governments, businesses and individuals to be pulling together in the same direction.&quot; The final wording of Friday&apos;s report will be hammered out during the coming week by scientists and government officials, who must approve it before its release. Publication of the second IPCC report in Brussels earlier this month was delayed after all-night discussions that saw several scientists walk out in protest at what they viewed as political interference. This week&apos;s talks could see similar scenes, particularly as it deals with the political hot potato of how world governments should act together to bring down emissions. The US has lobbied for research into futuristic technology such as giant sunlight-blocking mirrors in space as &quot;insurance&quot;, an idea which the draft summary dismisses as &quot;largely speculative, uncosted and with potential for unknown side effects&quot;. The report says that taking &quot;optimal&quot; mitigation measures might by 2030 stabilise greenhouse-gas concentrations in the atmosphere at 445 to 534 parts per million, up from an estimated 430 ppm today. It indicates that stabilising concentrations relatively quickly at 450 ppm - an unlikely scenario - could still limit the temperature rise to 2C above pre-industrial temperatures, which scientists say could avert severe damage. Achieving the 445-534 ppm range could cost up to 3% of global gross domestic product (GDP) over two decades, the draft says. Technology Geoffrey Levermore, an expert in housing emissions at Manchester University and another author on the report, said: &quot;With current technology, new technology and new policies, we can do this, but we might not be as prosperous. If someone has to cycle more rather than using the car, perhaps they might not be so productive.&quot; The report says that different technologies will be better suited to different regions, but that energy efficiency will play a key role for all. Greater use of renewable energy, nuclear power and biofuels will be needed to stabilise emissions, while protecting the world&apos;s forests could offer a more &quot;cost-effective&quot; solution. And it calls for the wider use of technology to capture carbon dioxide spewed from power stations and store it underground, known as carbon capture and storage (CCS). The draft says: &quot;A critical issue is how quickly new coal plants are going to be equipped with CCS, because retrofitting power plants with CCS later is economically unattractive.&quot; Energy companies in the developing world are building a handful of &quot;capture ready&quot; power stations, which can be adapted when the CCS technology is ready, but hundreds of plants being built throughout China and India are not so advanced and there will be no way to constrain their pollution. Coordination Jim Watson, an energy policy researcher at Sussex University, said: &quot;A lot of the plants that are being built and discussed in China are not up to the highest standards because they are being built by regional governments and utilities, and there isn&apos;t much coordination from the centre.&quot; He added: &quot;Generally it&apos;s hard to see a lot of concrete moves in the right direction. The technology menu is going to be broadly similar, and the question is are we any further towards getting it deployed?&quot; One of the most controversial findings of the report is likely to be its discussion of the various strategies international governments could take - the US has refused to adopt binding targets agreed under Kyoto and is resisting attempts to discuss a replacement, preferring voluntary agreements. The draft report says such voluntary agreements are not effective, but it also raises questions about the success of Kyoto-style treaties based on targets and carbon trading. It says the best approach is to tie development to investment in clean technology. Catherine Pearce, international climate campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said: &quot;We hope that this report will push governments to take action, by demonstrating that the policies, measures and sustainable energy technologies are readily available. We have no time to lose, and no excuses for further inaction.&quot; Sector by sector TransportDespite breakthroughs in cleaner options, such as hybrid cars, the sector is the fastest growing source of emissions, the report says. It highlights emerging technologies such as cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells and biofuels. Some campaigners warn that increasing use of biofuels could worsen problems such as food shortages, as farmers scramble to meet demand. The IPCC suggests this could be eased by a switch to biofuels made from waste cellulose. The report says government policies such as mandatory carbon dioxide emission standards are crucial, but that hikes in car tax, fuel duty and moves such as road pricing will be less effective as incomes rise. Better public transport can make a significant contribution. Potential saving by 2030 (million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent): 3,200 IndustryIndustry offers the largest potential savings, although the report acknowledges: &quot;Their implementation requires a stable policy environment that is respecting international competitiveness and includes measures for stimulating technology uptake.&quot; The IPCC suggests new controls on industrial pollutants such as methane, nitrous oxide and the chemicals HFCs and PFCs, all potent greenhouse gases. It also says there are big savings for firms who invest in more efficient use of fuels, materials and electricity, combined heat and power systems, and recycling. Heavily polluting industries could benefit from new process technologies that avoid carbon and are expected to come on-stream beyond 2015, it says. Potential savings: 6,500 Energy supplyMore efficient supply, renewable sources, shifts from coal to less polluting gas and nuclear power will play a role in the short to medium term, the IPCC report says. Managing such a transition requires &quot;active policy involvement&quot; such as reducing subsidies for fossil fuels while helping cleaner technology with renewable quotas for power companies and subsidies. The EU has pledged to generate 20% of all energy from renewable sources by 2020. The report says concern over energy security, combined with the development of power infrastructure in the developing world, creates an opportunity to reduce emissions cheaply. Potential savings: 5,100 Agriculture and forestrySoils, trees and vegetation provide an important carbon store, and the report says improved land and forestry management offer some of the easiest and cheapest emission savings. &quot;Many options are immediately deployable, do not reduce productivity and have co-benefits,&quot; it says. More efficient fertiliser use and better care of crop and grazing land are good too. On forestry, some 65% of the potential carbon savings are in the tropics, and the report says a &quot;combination of afforestation, avoided deforestation and agro-forestry&quot; is the best approach. One major sticking point is whether developing nations such as Brazil and Costa Rica should be paid not to chop down their virgin rainforest. Potential savings: 6,000 BuildingsLow-cost measures to improve the energy efficiency of buildings could save greenhouse gas emissions and money, the report says. It recommends countries should follow the examples of Germany and Switzerland and force through policies to cut emissions from housing. Appliance standards, building codes, better labelling and procurement procedures for the private sector have worked to cut pollution. Geoffrey Levermore, buildings expert at Manchester University who helped write the report, said: &quot;There&apos;s no blue sky technology to revolutionise this industry by giving us a little matchbox that will provide all the energy for your house, but if the right policies are implemented, there are some real savings to be made.&quot; Potential savings: 4,400 WasteThe IPCC says post-consumer waste, such as plastic bags, generates less than 5% of global emissions, but that the rubbish sector can still help to tackle global warming. Recovering methane from landfill sites in the developing world generates more than 15% of carbon credits traded under the Kyoto protocol. Waste management is a key component of wider moves toward sustainable development, it says. Unlike some sectors, the technologies available to reduce emissions from waste are &quot;mature and readily deployable&quot;. It adds: &quot;Recycling and waste minimisation provide indirect greenhouse gas mitigation benefits via the conservation of raw materials, and energy from waste offsets fossil fuel consumption.&quot; Potential saving: 1,250", "publicationDate": "2007-04-28T14:45:45Z", "tags": ["Environment", "Climate change", "UK news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/apr/28/climatechange.climatechangeenvironment", "title": "UN: we have the money and know-how to stop global warming", "sentences": ["The report, the third this year from the IPCC, looks at ways to tackle global warming and is due to be released in Bangkok on Friday."]}, {"article": "Why you should go ... As the plane from Bangkok circled over water-logged fields punctuated by gleaming bell-shaped temple roofs, I tried to imagine life in the country below - bleak, cut off from the world, and monitored by soldiers at every corner. How wrong I was.  Myanmar (Burma&apos;s name since 1989) has kept up with its Asian tiger neighbours and satellite dishes shower the cities with CNN and Korean soaps. It also wallows in natural resources: gold, rubies, oil, gas and timber bring in hefty revenues, and trade with China is booming. The capital&apos;s businessmen wear crisp white shirts and sarongs, and mutter into mobiles as they trip over broken pavements in their flip-flops. Leprous colonial facades stand beside characterless modern blocks. It&apos;s a strange, halfway, typically Asian world. Then, as I tucked into breakfast at Yangon&apos;s Traders&apos; Hotel, I saw that my fellow guests were from Italy, Spain, France, the US and the Far East - and most were tourists. Boycott? What boycott? Officially, 660,000 foreigners came to Myanmar in 2005, of whom only 3.5 per cent were British. Our historical links with Burma have encouraged most Britons to respect the tourism boycott called for by Aung San Suu Kyi, the elected leader held under house arrest by the ruling military dictatorship - and that has included me.  In recent months, however, the arguments of the Free Burma Coalition, a key opposition group, which now actively encourages tourism for the sake of the people of Burma, have received growing exposure and credence in the West, and this prompted me to discuss a trip with Amrit Singh, the Burma-born owner of UK-based tour operator TransIndus. Adamant that only a tiny proportion - 2 per cent - of her costs in Myanmar actually go to the government, she is also convinced that tourism can only help the country on the path to democracy. Despite the evocative lure of Rangoon (now redubbed Yangon), Mandalay and the Irrawaddy river (very George Orwell; Burmese Days is waved at you everywhere), you cannot ignore Burmese politics. Suu Kyi is gagged, ethnic minorities are victimised and censorship and forced labour are daily realities. Log on to your hotel broadband and you cannot access Hotmail or Yahoo!; switch on your mobile and nothing happens - Myanmar&apos;s government network operates without Sim cards. These controls are just some of the reasons we are told not to go. What has saved the Burmese spirit is an unwavering belief in Theravada Buddhism. Keen to win brownie points for an upgraded hereafter, they pile on the gold leaf (reducing one large Buddha I saw to a formless blob), stuff donation boxes with kyat notes and diligently construct pagodas. In no other Buddhist country have I seen such dazzle, from Yangon&apos;s Shwedagon, where a bejewelled gold finial tops the massive temple already dripping with 60 tonnes of gold, to Mandalay&apos;s Mahamuni Paya (paya means temple), where a 2,000-year-old Buddha statue is lovingly regilded and even has its teeth brushed - daily. At these historic paya, and at less grandiose rural ones, I watched locals picnic, snooze and generally hang out in the shady halls and terraces.  Bagan, a 90-minute flight north of the capital, is Myanmar&apos;s spectacular equivalent of Cambodia&apos;s Angkor. A vast plain (from whose core zone the locals were forcibly moved in 1990 to give tourists a &apos;cleaner&apos; image) is studded with some 4,000 pagodas, temples and monasteries dating from the ninth-13th centuries. Looting, neglect, floods, bats and, above all, an earthquake in 1975 have taken their toll, but restoration and Unesco have also revived delicate frescoes depicting Buddha&apos;s life, reinstated 10 metre-high gilded statues and rebuilt crumbling brick walls. Some now look just too perfect. Yet as my pony cart (the local form of taxi) clip-clopped around the deserted outlying structures, it felt so like a lost age of innocence that it was too easy to forget the iniquities of today. Cattle grazed, bullock carts rocked by, goatherds strolled through peanut fields and beaming villagers strode past with yokes on their shoulders. That tranquillity evaporated when I entered the more imposing royal temples of the central zone. I was stormed by women stallholders thrusting lacquer boxes and temple chimes at me and chanting dollar prices. These desperate tactics were in high contrast to their beauty - Burmese women put any Western starlet to shame, despite large yellow splodges daubed on their faces. This is thanaka, a bark paste which acts as a natural skin cream and which even men wear quite unselfconsciously - making a crowd of Burmese look like they work in slapstick. I followed my nose to a Banyan tree shading an outdoor kitchen surrounded by children&apos;s tables. Adult customers bent double on their tiny stools were wolfing down lunch, so I followed suit. This turned out to be gourmet gold - all for about 50p. I sampled street meals elsewhere without any gastric revenge. Yet again, my preconceptions were trashed; I had been told the food was abysmal. My next stop was Mandalay, home to 80 per cent of the country&apos;s monks. Temple-fatigue was setting in but nothing could beat the sight of hundreds of monks, young and old, hopping on and off buses on their morning food-rounds and, later, more than 1,000 of them patiently queueing for lunch at Mahagandhayon, Myanmar&apos;s largest monastery.  One night, as I looked for a taxi, a young monk started testing his limited English. He ended up chaperoning me for the evening, from a restaurant to the outrageous Moustache Brothers, Mynamar&apos;s only satirists. Banned in Burmese after a performance at Suu Kyi&apos;s house, they now perform nightly in English in their family home - with backpackers as their audience. At Pindaya, a short flight away in the eastern Shan state, I gawped at a gigantic cave packed with 8,000 or so effigies of Buddha, before heading for a heaving marketplace.

Women smoked little pipes and men chewed and spat betel with a vengeance. With the help of my gentle guide, Momo, interaction was easy and laced with giggles.  After this trip I feel strongly that Burma&apos;s Big Brother needs observers; the more informed foreigners who travel there the better.

But it does to us.&apos; I heard this again and again - but only from people I spoke to on their own: they live in terror of informers. As one monk with magnificently betel-stained teeth and impeccable English said mischievously: &apos;Tourists are a smokeless industry.

Why you must not go Zoya Phan, a refugee from Burma and human rights activist, argues it is the last place you should visit I could hardly believe it the first time I heard someone tell me that tourism helps ordinary people in Burma. I was just 14 when the army came to my village and opened fire without warning, killing unarmed people. I can still remember the black smoke in the sky behind us as we fled for our lives.  They attacked us because we were of the Karen ethnic minority. For decades the Karen and other minorities had faced attacks from the various regimes that have ruled Burma, but since the 1990s the ferocity and scale of the attacks has increased. What had changed? The regime opened Burma to international trade, investment, and tourism. The billions of dollars flooding into the country did not benefit ordinary people. In fact the regime reduced its spending on health and education. Instead it doubled the size of the army and stepped up its attacks on the people. The dictatorship has identified tourism as a vital source of income, with the hope that tourists can not only provide them with the money for guns, but also bring greater respectability to an illegitimate military regime. Human rights violations are directly connected with tourism in other ways - thousands of people have been forcibly driven from their homes in order to beautify cities, suppress dissent and make way for tourist facilities. Many of the roads and railways that tourists travel on or the airports they pass through have been built using forced labour.  Even the most fanatical advocates of tourism to Burma, such as Lonely Planet&apos;s Tony Wheeler, admit it is impossible to visit Burma without the regime benefiting financially. I&apos;ve seen the consequences first hand: my village attacked, my friends killed, women and children raped, villagers tortured. Your tourism dollars help pay for that, so please, for now, stay away. \u00b7 For more, see www.burmacampaign.org.uk, or call 020 7324 4710.", "publicationDate": "2007-04-29T13:09:04Z", "tags": ["Travel", "Myanmar holidays", "Asia", "Ethical holidays", "Ethical and green living"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/apr/29/escape.burma", "title": "The biggest travel taboo: a holiday  in Burma", "sentences": ["Why you should go ...

By the of the week, delegates attending the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are expected to come up with technological options to curb rising levels of carbon dioxide, methane and other heat-trapping gases. &quot;The time to act is now,&quot; Chartree Chueyprasit, a deputy secretary in Thailand&apos;s ministry of natural resources and environment, told delegates. &quot;Global warming has increasingly become a hot (issue) which requires harmonised cooperating between all nations. The IPCC has realised the scientific knowledge to provide the necessary solutions.&quot; A draft report, to be amended following comments from dozens of governments, says emissions can be cut below current levels if the world shifts away from fossil fuels such as coal. It also calls for investment in energy efficiency and agricultural reform. &quot;The science certainly provides a lot of compelling reasons for action,&quot; said Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the climate change panel. &quot;But what action and when is what the government will have to decide.&quot; Major polluters such as the US, China and Saudi Arabia, the world&apos;s biggest oil exporter, are expected to seek to water down the report. They are wary of language that sets targets to cut emissions or threatens their oil and gas industries. &quot;This meeting will be even more contentious than previous ones as we are moving from the science into the political and into energy policy,&quot; said Catherine Pearce, the Friends of the Earth&apos;s International climate campaigner. &quot;The US is particularly keen in not wanting the Kyoto protocol mentioned and in wanting to promote voluntary initiatives.&quot; Others controversial areas will be proposals to use nuclear energy, genetically-modified food and schemes to capture carbon and whether incentives to cut emissions will be tax-based. The UN climate panel issued its first report in February, saying it was at least 90% certain that mankind was to blame for warming. The second report on April 6 warned of more hunger, droughts, heat waves and rising seas. Scientists have said that global warming could increase the number of hungry in the world in 2080 by between 140 million and 1 billion by contributing to widespread droughts and flooding. Diseases like malaria, diarrhoea and dengue fever could spread as temperatures rise and weather becomes increasing erratic, affecting the world&apos;s poorest people. The draft report stresses that the world must quickly embrace technological options - already available and being developed - just to keep the temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Making buildings more energy-efficient, especially in the developing world, through better insulation, lighting and other steps, could also lead to significant cuts as would converting from coal to natural gas, nuclear power and renewable energy such as wind. Less significant but also important would be steps to make motor vehicles more fuel-efficient, reduce deforestation, and plant more trees as &quot;carbon sinks&quot; to absorb carbon dioxide. While welcoming the latest report, Friends of the Earth said what mattered were actions not words. &quot;We hope that this report will push governments to take action, by demonstrating that the policies, measures and sustainable energy technologies are readily available.

Dabo needed treatment for facial cuts after being repeatedly punched in an incident which was witnessed by a group of children who were watching the practice session. Barton was immediately suspended for the season and he will be informed at a disciplinary hearing that he will never play for the club again. City&apos;s board has decided to cut its losses and accept cut-price offers, a development which is likely to interest Everton, Newcastle and Middlesbrough. The flare-up comes only 10 days after Barton, who has undergone anger-management counselling at the Sporting Chance clinic in Hampshire, complained that City&apos;s summer signings, including Dabo, had let down the club and said he would not pay to watch if he were a fan. He apparently incited the fight by sliding into a late tackle on Dabo during a game to work on tactics for Saturday&apos;s derby against Manchester United. A few minutes later Dabo retaliated with a late tackle of his own. When Barton fouled him for a second time the two squared up and Barton repeatedly lashed out before being dragged away. Dabo was taken to hospital but released after treatment. Now he may take Barton&apos;s place against United. Barton&apos;s agent Willie McKay, who acted for Dabo when he joined City, tried to pin the blame on the Frenchman. &quot;Joey was defending himself. But because it is Joey it makes headlines.

In a hotel bar in Bangkok, he physically attacked a schoolboy Everton fan and had to be restrained by his team-mate Richard Dunne. He was subsequently sent home in disgrace and fined eight weeks&apos; wages.

There&apos;s no time to lose. We must act. By now, pretty much everyone has heard the message from scientists on climate change and it was repeated again today.

It follows an IPCC report in February which essentially said: global warming - it&apos;s our fault.

The good news is, if you believe the IPCC, the environmental gains can be made without too much economic pain, assuming governments around the world act immediately.

The message is: we have to do something now.&quot; That&apos;s not only the IPCC&apos;s message, but its implied question - is the will available? Chinese delegates argued strongly against some of the targets for reducing emissions, saying these would harm the country&apos;s economic growth. And, as we learned last month, this is the nation about to become the world&apos;s single biggest producer of greenhouse gases. Before we get into another China-bashing session, don&apos;t forget that industrialised nations still produce immeasurably more greenhouse gases per head of population than poorer ones, and show few signs of changing their ways.

The report by the UN&apos;s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world&apos;s most authoritative organisation looking at the issue, was hailed by environmentalists as a &quot;road map&quot; for avoiding disaster. The technology already exists for countries to tackle the issue through the greater use of biofuels and renewable energy sources, and improving overall energy efficiency, the week-long gathering in Bangkok concluded. But only immediate action can cap the average global temperature increase at around 2C, they said. There was some opposition from China - the country about to become the world&apos;s single biggest producer of greenhouse gases - which argued that moves to cut emissions should be delayed so as to avoid harming its economic development. However, a draft version of the final report contained references to stringent emissions targets, to which the Chinese delegates had objected earlier in the week. It is the third report produced this year by the IPCC, a UN network of 2,000 scientists from more than 110 countries. In February, the organisation concluded that it is more than 90% likely human activity is responsible for climate change, warning this could see global temperatures rise by up to 6C by 2100, triggering disaster for billions of people. Even the aimed-for level of a 2C increase could mean up to 2 billion people facing water shortages by 2050 and could threaten extinction for 20% to 30% of the world&apos;s species, the IPCC warned. Despite the disagreements with China, and other contentious issues such as how to share the global burden of reduced emissions and the use of nuclear power, delegates praised the final report as unequivocal and decisive. &quot;It&apos;s stunning in its brilliance and relevance,&quot; said Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the panel that convened the meeting. &quot;It&apos;s a remarkable step forward.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s all done,&quot; added Peter Lukey, a member of the South Africa delegation. &quot;Everything we wanted to see was there, and more.

According to the draft report, which delegates said was the same in all key respects as the final document, the IPCC concludes that emissions need to start declining by 2015 to avoid the worst effects of global warming. From this peak, emissions should then gradually fall by 50% to 85% below 2000 levels.

Is Mr Seager also aware that the refining of semiconductor-grade silicon consumes prodigious quantities of electricity, and also water, as well as using hideously noxious chemicals?  Steve Pardoe, Acton Bridge, Cheshire Stockton Unitarians have great sympathy with Ashley Seager, having just replaced our energy-guzzling Victorian church with a new meeting house designed to minimise our impact on the environment. It includes a 2kW array of PV tiles which is currently producing 10kWh a day. Most of this is being exported to the network but we are getting no credit for it because we have yet to find an electricity company that will buy it. nPower, our supplier, says it will only buy back electricity from individuals. It classes the church (a registered charity) as a business. The process of applying to be an electricity supplier, registering for &quot;ROC&quot; payments and getting someone to buy our surplus power, is extraordinarily complicated. We also intend to fit a domestic wind turbine but our planning application is on hold with Stockton council.

Parking space is a commodity like any other and as such should be paid for. The charges quoted for residents&apos; parking seem reasonable to me (\u00a384 pa = 23p a day; \u00a395 pa = 26p a day), a small price to pay for the privilege of obstructing the highway. The parking problem is a monument to the lack of foresight displayed by politicians and administrators when use of motor vehicles began to grow.

Those of us residing cheek by jowl in central London, who find cars a necessity because we may have, for instance, an immobilised mother in her 90s, need to fight for a parking space whether or not we can use mother&apos;s disabled parking permit.

He booked his flight by telephone with STA and received a full receipt showing details. He was unsure whether he had an e-ticket or if a paper ticket would be issued, so he telephoned STA and was told there would be no paper ticket, simply the e-ticket which had been sent to him. He assumed that the receipt he had received was the e-ticket as nothing else was sent. But when he turned up at Heathrow, he was told he should have had a paper ticket. He had to cancel his ticket and book an alternative flight which cost an extra \u00a3190. STA denied all responsibility, even though no paper ticket was ever received.

Greater energy efficiency, renewable electricity sources and new technology to dump carbon dioxide underground can all help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the experts said. But there could be as little as eight years left to avoid a dangerous global average rise of 2C or more. The warning came in a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published yesterday in Bangkok. It says most of the technology needed to stop climate change in its tracks already exists, but that governments must act quickly to force through changes across all sectors of society. Delays will make the problem more difficult, and more expensive. Rajendra Pachauri, who chairs the IPCC, said the report would underpin negotiations to develop a new international treaty to regulate emissions to replace the Kyoto protocol when it expires in 2012. The report said little on the best way to encourage greater take-up of cleaner technologies. A delegate present at the negotiations said the passages on international policy options had been watered down by the US, which is opposed to Kyoto-style agreements that rely on binding targets. Harlan Watson, head of the US delegation, said the report &quot;highlights the importance of a portfolio of clean energy technologies, consistent with our approach&quot;. There were also rows about the role of nuclear power, with countries including Spain and Austria opposed to any form of words that endorsed an increase in electricity from nuclear technology. David Miliband, the environment secretary, said: &quot;Last year, the Stern review showed that we needed to act urgently to tackle climate change and that it was economically feasible to do so. The IPCC has confirmed that finding, and that we have access to the technology we need to take that action. We simply can&apos;t afford any other option but to act. That&apos;s why we&apos;re pushing hard for negotiations to start on a new global climate deal this year, and are working through the G8 group of nations and the UN climate change conference.&quot; Yesterday&apos;s report follows two studies by the IPCC this year, which said unrestrained greenhouse gas emissions could drive global temperatures up as much as 6C by 2100, triggering a surge in ocean levels, destruction of vast numbers of species, economic devastation in tropical zones and mass human migrations. The report said global emissions must peak by 2015 for the world to have any chance of limiting the expected temperature rise to 2C, which would still leave billions of people short of water by 2050. Michael Roberts, of the Confederation of British Industry, said: &quot;The report signals that there are barriers to realising the range of opportunities identified and that we all - consumers, businesses and governments - have a role to play in overcoming these obstacles.

In the red corner is Al Gore, swinging for imminent global catastrophe. In the blue corner, Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley, former policy adviser to Margaret Thatcher and great white hope of climate-change sceptics. The adverts are a challenge from Monckton to Gore to debate the warming of the planet, for a rumble in the deforested jungle. So far, the challenge has not been accepted or acknowledged. Just before the adverts were first placed, I went to see Monckton at his home in Rannoch, in the Highlands, with the idea of finding out exactly where he was coming from. On the four-hour drive north from Glasgow, I experienced in succession bright dawn sunshine, black cloud, rain, hail, sleet, mist and fog. At the far end of the loch on which Monckton&apos;s house sits, the light was catching the snow on the conical peak of Schiehallion. This is a place where weather moves in fast-forward. I was greeted by Monckton&apos;s wife, Juliet, and their spaniel. The house, which they designed and built here five years ago, a grand vernacular building, opens on to a garden on which geese waddle. The air is shockingly fresh. Monckton, wearing a tweed suit, is in his library, lined with volumes ancient and modern, Googling. He suffers from a rare endocrine complaint, which has necessitated a series of operations, the latest of which has left him virtually marooned in this valley for a year or so. As house arrests go, it would be hard to think of a more idyllic confinement. He puts on a cap and walks me down to his jetty; he has plans to sail here when he gets more strength. If his physical pace is relatively slow, however, there is not much impairing Monckton&apos;s mental vigour. Brother of Rosa Monckton, Mrs Dominic Lawson, he is reportedly known to his nieces and nephews as &apos;Mr Knowledge&apos;. He gave some credibility to this nickname with his invention of the 209-piece Eternity jigsaw puzzle, which offered a reward of \u00a31m for the first winning solution. Two Cambridge scientists got there in 18 months; reports at the time suggested Monckton had lost a fortune, but he now claims 500,000 copies of the puzzle were sold worldwide. Anyhow, Eternity II, which will offer another prize of \u00a31m, is to be launched in July. As we walk, Monckton, 55, talks with irrepressible good humour and impervious authority on this and any other subject I raise, from the Forestry Commission (spectacularly incompetent) to the Guardian (ditto). He laughs without restraint at his own anecdotes. He is not a man, you might say, who seems plagued by self-doubt. This confidence is never more apparent than in Monckton&apos;s analysis of the subject on which his mind is now engaged pretty much constantly, the science and politics of climate change. Back in the house, we sit in his library, mist rolling on to the loch outside, Juliet serves mid-morning champagne and he launches into the polemic with which he would like to assault Al Gore if he could get him into the debating ring. &apos;Rope-a-dope&apos; seems to be the best tactic against this diatribe, so I sit and listen. Monckton got into all this when he was first at home recuperating. &apos;I decided to amuse myself by looking at this question, because it was a big one,&apos; he says, &apos;And on the big ones as Margaret [Thatcher] used to say, you have to be right!&apos; He had some vague form in the area. In 1988, he wrote one of the first articles, in the London Evening Standard, about the concern in scientific journals that carbon emissions were warming the atmosphere. It was a jokey piece of the kind with which we have since become horribly familiar: Monckton had bought a house high on Richmond Hill, the rest of us would have to take to the boats, ha, ha. &apos;Margaret Thatcher,&apos; he says, repeating a name never far from his lips, &apos;who was a rather keen reader of my columns in the Standard, and prone to cut them out and wave them at her colleagues, did so with this one. Not only that, she made a speech to the Royal Society saying we need to study whether this is a problem or not. And she established the Hadley Centre for forecasting climate change on the back of it.&apos; (This pattern, I realise, quickly becomes a familiar one: all wisdom leads back to Monckton.) Anyhow, in the years since, and in particular in the last year, he has continued to look at the question, has done the maths (&apos;Radiative transfer calculations I can do standing on my head&apos;) and formed his own conclusions. These conclusions were first made public after he received a call from a fund manager from the City: &apos;Monckton, climate change. What d&apos;you think?&apos; Monckton told him. &apos;I said basically I think there is very little for us to worry about at all,&apos; he says, brightly, which no doubt comes as a great relief to the anxious majority of the world&apos;s population. &apos;I said the weakness in the &quot;consensus&quot; argument is that they haven&apos;t been able to quantify accurately what the effect of carbon dioxide on temperature is. I said there are so many uncertainties that the exaggerated figures we are getting of up to 10C increase in temperature by the end of the century are simply not plausible in any calculation you would care to do.&apos; He sent the man from the City the conclusions he had drawn from &apos;the back of an envelope&apos; and more extensive calculations he had done (outsmarting at a stroke thousands of the world&apos;s scientists). The man was so impressed he apparently passed them on to Patience Wheatcroft, the editor of the Sunday Telegraph. She decided to publish them under the heading &apos;Climate chaos? Don&apos;t believe it&apos;. From up here in Rannoch, it then looked as if the sky had fallen in. Monckton&apos;s calculations received 127,000 hits on the day of publication and crashed the Telegraph&apos;s website. He received many thousand emails, still running at 100 a day - he shows me his inbox - &apos;many,&apos; he claims, &apos;from distinguished climatologists saying &quot;at last someone has had the guts to say this&quot;.&apos; Not all of the response was positive. George Monbiot of the Guardian trashed Monckton&apos;s argument with the help of Dr Stephan Harrison, senior research associate at the Oxford University Centre for the Environment, who wrote: &apos;[Monckton] purports to show how scientists from a wide range of different disciplines, including atmospheric physics, atmospheric chemistry, climatology and palaeoclimatology, have misunderstood and misused the science of climate change and he tries to debunk them all. Let it not be said that the man lacks ambition.&apos; Harrison went on to refute in close detail many of Monckton&apos;s claims. Monbiot was promptly threatened with legal action by the peer who suggested that his articles were &apos;libellous of me in my calling&apos;. (When I speak to Monbiot subsequently, he says it would have been an interesting court case: &apos;I could have called all the world&apos;s leading climatologists and he could have called David Bellamy.&apos;) In the end, Monckton agreed to a right of reply. Al Gore also ventured a dismissal which was met, overnight, by a further 16 pages of Monckton&apos;s argument, a preamble to the great debate that will never happen. Monckton&apos;s opinion of his putative opponent is not a generous one. &apos;You don&apos;t get to be Vice-President of the United States if you are a halfwit, so you have to assume this is an act,&apos; he says. &apos;But his film is hilariously, absurdly, seriously and materially inaccurate!&apos; I venture a question. Where, I wonder, does his certainty in his own calculations - he suggests a warming of perhaps 0.6 degrees in the next century, of which man may perhaps be responsible for half - come from? It comes from his &apos;training in the scientific method&apos;, while reading classics at Cambridge. It comes from his four years leading the policy unit during the high-water mark of Thatcherism in the mid-Eighties, when he was required to develop a stance on &apos;scientific scams&apos; of all kinds. Monckton then proceeds for an hour or two to take me in substantial detail through Al Gore&apos;s inconvenient errors, stopping en route to highlight the &apos;codswallop&apos; of the Stern report and the &apos;spin&apos; of the latest findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which will be signed off in Bangkok this weekend. (The fact that the latter was produced in consultation with 2,500 of the world&apos;s foremost climatologists does not deter him for a moment.) It is, in many respects, a formidable performance. Monckton moves easily from the philosophy of science, quoting Weber and Popper (&apos;You can&apos;t prove any hypothesis, you can only improve or disprove it&apos;) to the fact that Edward Lorenz, the father of chaos theory, which demonstrated the fundamental unpredictability of complex systems, took the example of meteorology. &apos;You can&apos;t say for certain what will happen to the weather in the long term!&apos; What&apos;s the long term? &apos;About two weeks, ha!&apos; Some of Monckton&apos;s argument is familiar - medieval warming, sun spots, the presence of graveyards in Greenland under permafrost - some less so - the reminder that in the 1970s, the panic was &apos;global cooling&apos;. He suggests I read all manner of arcane papers, which I subsequently do, and end up not much wiser. His major gripe with Al Gore&apos;s film - a fair one - is that it ignores the &apos;developing nations&apos;. While Gore insists we should turn off our TV stand-bys, China plans to open a coal-fired power plant every five days. This, Monckton says, proves that Gore is not serious about the science. &apos;If Britain was to close down altogether overnight, then China would take up the slack of carbon emissions in two years. If America closed down, just the growth in China&apos;s emissions would replace America&apos;s emissions in 12 years. The very first thing we should do, if this is a serious threat, is to give China the latest - South African - nuclear technology. Gore seems happy to exclude China, Brazil and India from his argument. He has been feted in China - and no surprise.&apos; Two things are evident from all this. The first is that Monckton has done the homework. When I mention Naomi Oreskes&apos;s famous evaluation of 928 articles referencing &apos;climate change&apos; that &apos;proved&apos; the consensus of catastrophe among scientists, he announces not only that he has read the 928 articles in question and would argue &apos;only 1 per cent explicitly predict doom, while 3 per cent are specifically sceptical of apocalyptic ideas&apos;, but also that he has sent a further 8,500 related articles to be evaluated by a team of two dozen scientists across the globe. The second is that he suffers an extreme case of the patrician sense that good breeding and a decent classical education equip you for anything, even for outwitting the collective intelligence of the world&apos;s best scientific brains (which is also, no doubt, the motivation behind the wager of his jigsaw puzzles). In his Sunday Telegraph article, he announced his lack of &apos;paper qualifications&apos; as if such things were beneath a man of his quality, the preserve of the &apos;leftists on campuses&apos;. It is telling that the other two major political voices who share his scepticism belong to the father-and-son team of Nigel and Dominic Lawson, part of Monckton&apos;s extended family. Some of his - and their - anger is directed at David Cameron. &apos;We have a Conservative party that is functionally dead ... or at least David Cameron seems to have decided that the only way to get elected is to appear as much like Tony Blair in 1997 as possible. So he has adopted his goofy green agenda.&apos; There is, as a result, no political debate on these issues as there is in America. I wonder if he sees his challenges to Gore as the start of a campaign? &apos;Realistically, since I am a very sick man, I cannot go out and lead movements on this or any other subject.&apos; That must be a frustration? &apos;Well, I like to think that my illness has prevented me from rising to any number of dizzy heights. The fact is that I can&apos;t go too many miles from this house without falling ill.&apos; There was a time when those dizzy heights must have seemed quite near, particularly when Monckton was plucked from the Sunday Telegraph magazine to work at Number 10 in 1983. &apos;She [Thatcher] had tried to get me two years earlier,&apos; he says, &apos;but I was told later that my appointment was blocked by a group of low-church Protestants in the party who did not want a Catholic in the government. Eventually, Margaret said: I&apos;m having him!&apos; From those momentous words on, in his own head, Christopher Monckton appears always to have been starring in a Boy&apos;s Own adventure entitled &apos;Monckton Saves the Day!&apos; He probably gets some of that brio from his late father, Gilbert Monckton, who was &apos;the youngest general in the British army&apos;, who won an MC at Dunkirk. Much of the rest comes from the endorsement of &apos;the Lady&apos;. For a start, in this adventure, in which he routinely wore a bowler hat, Monckton won the Falklands conflict from his armchair after suggesting, he claims, to the Prime Minister that the best way to undermine the Argies was to have the SAS introduce a mild bacillus into the water supply in Port Stanley. &apos;I can tell you from experience there is nothing more demoralising than having the trots in a trench!&apos; He believes, laughing a little wildly, she took him up on this idea and the rest is history. On other occasions, try as he might, even Monckton could not get heard. He would have averted the Aids epidemic (having produced &apos;probably the first working model for the transmission of this particular kind of retrovirus in the UK&apos;, he insisted to the cabinet on compulsory testing of adults, legally enforced &apos;restricted association&apos; for people who were HIV positive, but nothing was done). &apos;Lobby groups howled. The homosexual lobby said we know you, you&apos;re a Catholic, you don&apos;t like queers.&apos; He would have saved us from poll tax by scrapping local taxation and adding to VAT, but he got sick and in his absence the foppish Oliver Letwin had decided that a universal tax was too &apos;intellectually satisfying&apos; to ignore. He would have prevented us joining the ERM. &apos;Not because I hate the European Union, but because I worked out the economics on the back of an envelope. [Monckton&apos;s pockets, I can&apos;t help thinking, must be stuffed with such calculations.] But John Major would not be told. I wrote to him privately; I sent people to see him. But he was deaf to the idea.&apos; In the end, like all good Tories, he instead placed a sizeable bet on sterling collapsing and &apos;made a packet&apos; when it did. Does he think he has ever been wrong about anything at all? He ponders for a long moment. &apos;Not on the big ones, no!&apos; So what will happen, does he imagine, to the current &apos;big one&apos;? &apos;Well,&apos; he says, breezily, &apos;for a few years, the temperature will continue to rise, but nowhere near as fast as the alarmists would wish it to rise. Then solar physicists suggest that in the next solar cycle but one, and a solar cycle is about 10.6 years, there will be a considerable cooling of the Sun. And the panic will disappear.&apos; Hey presto. Before I go, he insists, by way of mathematical humiliation, that he gives me a little test based on Mandelbrot&apos;s fractals, by which slight variations in x and y co-ordinates can produce infinite geometrical variety. He smiles at my fumbling with figures and then runs the equation deftly through his computer to produce a vivid graphic demonstration that lights up his face. As I drive back along the bonny banks of Loch Lomond, Monckton&apos;s voice is still in my head. He seems made for cartoons, somehow. In one, I picture him alone, shivering in Scotland, 20 years from now, merrily barking: &apos;I told you so!&apos; to a gang of white-coated professors; in another, he is up to his neck in water, in his tweeds, still arguing that he was right all along.

Morris, who previously spent six years as a foreign correspondent for the BBC and helped establish the corporation&apos;s bureau in Gaza, will take over as presenter of More4 News from Sarah Smith, who is to become Washington correspondent for Channel 4 News. &quot;Yes, I&apos;m coming in from the cold. It&apos;s a great opportunity,&quot; says Morris, who is taking over the helm on a programme that is a rarity in British television - serious news on a digital channel (though, of course, that means it doesn&apos;t have that many viewers.) &quot;It would have been a waste of my experience if it was just reading an autocue, but if you watch Sarah Smith and Jon Snow, they&apos;re engaging with the news that they&apos;re reporting - and that&apos;s what makes those programmes so interesting to watch. You don&apos;t know what&apos;s going to happen; they&apos;re thinking and talking, so things evolve during the programme.&quot; The critics did not think much of More4 News when it launched in 2005. The Independent on Sunday dubbed it &quot;Less4 News&quot;, criticising it for making do with cast-offs from its parent show, fronted by Jon Snow on the main Channel 4 network. But over the past year the programme has ploughed a distinctive furrow in the field of international news, often giving opportunities to indigenous journalists. There was a memorable piece last week about the Iraq-based smugglers who keep Iran supplied with bootleg booze, and a powerful report last year about the growing number of officially sanctioned executions of gay men in Iraq. It was nominated for best news programme at the RTS journalism awards this year. Smith has turned More4 News into &quot;her&quot; show, with a distinctive presentational style typified by her strong Scottish accent. He successor will also be noticed for her voice: she is Australian (Snow once mistakenly called her Kylie Minogue in a live link). Morris, who was part of the RTS award-winning team covering the war in Lebanon, admits that she will miss going out on stories and working with her local contacts, but says she is looking forward to getting to grips with working in the studio and tackling a variety of stories. &quot;You never tire of foreign news, but the mechanics of it can be a bit wearying,&quot; she says. The dangers of being a foreign reporter also become more apparent the longer you do it, she says with reference to her friend Alan Johnston. &quot;It&apos;s chilling to watch having worked and lived in Gaza, and I know Alan well. The weird thing now about being a foreign correspondent is that everyone now has these experiences of knowing someone who has been in that situation, or been in that situation themselves. It seems to have become a dangerous business.&quot; Is that behind her move into the studio? &quot;It&apos;s not enough to stop me being a foreign correspondent. I&apos;m stopping because I&apos;ve got another opportunity.&quot; Morris is looking forward to other benefits of moving back to the UK. &quot;It will be great to walk out my door and get any number of excellent newspapers in English. That&apos;s really fantastic after living in cities where that&apos;s absolutely not possible,&quot; she says. &quot;And being able to sit on buses and understand what people are saying coherently. I&apos;m quite looking forward to participating, losing my outsider status a bit. That&apos;s a big challenge.

Ed McBain, aka Evan Hunter. Photograph: Sean Smith Five years ago, when the Washington Post asked me to review crime fiction each week, I was a fan but not really a student of the genre. For many years, purely for fun, I&apos;d read early masters like Dashiell Hammett, John D MacDonald, and Ed McBain, and current stars like Michael Connelly and Thomas Harris. But I had never given much thought to how crime fiction has evolved over the years. But evolved it certainly has, and I soon reached a number of conclusions about how and why this evolution happened. First, the crime-related books we now call thrillers - private-eye novels, legal thrillers, spy thrillers, even literary thrillers - constitute the new mainstream of American popular fiction. If you look back a few decades, the bestseller lists were dominated by writers like James Michener, Harold Robbins, and Jackie Susann. They wrote about sex, movie stars, wars, and exotic foreign lands, but not about crime - crime novels were still &quot;genre fiction,&quot; often published as paperback originals. All that has changed. Look at the American bestseller lists any Sunday and you&apos;ll find that at least half of the novels listed are thrillers of one sort or another. Some are writers I admire (Michael Connelly, Elmore Leonard, Sue Grafton) and some are writers I deplore (James Patterson, Patricia Cornwell) but, either way, they are what America is buying. I also decided that the best of these writers - including Dennis Lehane, George Pelecanos, Scott Turow, and the spy novelists Robert Littell and Alan Furst are among the most talented writers at work today. Admittedly I say that as a middle-brow, one who loves good popular fiction and isn&apos;t much impressed by the &quot;literary fiction&quot; that excites many reviewers. But I found that a lot of people agree with me, and in time I put down my views in a book called &quot;The Triumph of the Thriller.&quot; Why has the thriller become so popular? For many reasons. During the 1960s, a series of court decisions made it possible to publish just about anything. A burst of sex-centered novels followed. But about twenty years ago, many readers became sated with sexy novels. After all, sex is no longer the mystery it once was. Today, suspense, not sex, is the engine that drives popular fiction. We like a good story, we like a mystery, and we like to figure out whodunit. Of course, that&apos;s been true at least since Agatha Christie, but today&apos;s increasingly sophisticated mysteries add social commentary and complex characters to the mix. If for example, you want to know what life is like for black people in Washington, D.C., take a look at George Pelecanos&apos; gritty, uncompromising crime novels In my opinion, Michael Connelly&apos;s Harry Bosch novels are the best crime series that anyone, anywhere, has ever written. Dennis Lehane&apos;s &quot;Mystic River&quot; transcends crime fiction and is simply a great American novel, and Thomas Harris&apos;s &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; is the greatest of modern thrillers, introducing the most compelling fictional villain since Shakespeare&apos;s Richard III. Although my focus is on American fiction, I admire the work of a number of writers in England, Scotland and Ireland, including Ian Rankin&apos;s great Inspector Rebus series, John Lawton&apos;s fine novels set in London during the Second World War, John Burdett&apos;s two Bangkok novels, and the wildly creative work of Irish-born Ken Bruen and Adrian McKinty.

Many of the objects it contains are exquisite: prehistoric jars decorated with hypnotic geometric patterns, Angkor-period statues of kings and Hindu gods whose smooth torsos and beatific expressions radiate gentleness - aesthetic worlds away from the gaudy baroque of Indian popular art. Unlike, say, the British Museum, where devices monitor humidity levels and the artefacts appear infinitely distant, frozen in neoclassical limbo, these statues are still functional objects, the recipients of daily religious devotion.  In front of the dancing Shiva and the eighth-century sandstone Ganesh, tilting his head and dipping his trunk into a bowl of water, there are sheaves of burning incense sticks and offerings of jasmine flowers. (The staff make a little cash on the side by selling these to visitors.) In Cambodia, where Theravada Buddhism washes over a Hindu past and an animist love for the particular - the river, the jungle clearing, the spring - it&apos;s logical that a museum should be a place of worship as well as learning. These stone gods and kings feel somehow more precious than their counterparts in the treasure houses of other equally proud countries. They are survivors of Year Zero, the Khmer Rouge&apos;s attempt to erase history, proof of the Cambodian ability to create and preserve beauty through the destruction that engulfed their country after the American invasion of 1970.  In one room, there&apos;s a statue of the meditating Buddha, perhaps from the 13th century. A little enclosure has been created for it, with a table for offerings, and on the sides of its concrete base the &apos;four noble truths&apos; of Buddhism picked out in river pebbles: you should know suffering; you should abandon origins; you should attain cessation; and (the odd one out, in French) &apos;l&apos;ignorance est l&apos;ennemi de la vie&apos;. That is not the usual phrasing of the &apos;fourth truth&apos;, an injunction to follow the path of Buddhist teaching. &apos;Ignorance is the enemy of life&apos; sounds like the anguished cry of a museum curator, a warning from someone alive in the old colonial days when French was widely spoken. Whatever you do, don&apos;t smash the past. Don&apos;t forget. Here in Phnom Penh, it&apos;s hard not to read a terrible sadness into these Buddhist instructions for transcending the pain of existence.  Across town is a former school known as Tuol Sleng, a cluster of rundown concrete buildings round an open yard. This was once S-21, a secret interrogation centre where Khmer Rouge cadres, many no more than children, used torture to extract insane, florid confessions from their prisoners, who were then driven out of the city to the killing fields. An estimated 17,000 people passed through this place. There were seven survivors. Tuol Sleng is almost unbearable. Not because of the classrooms partitioned by crudely built brick walls into tiny cells. Not even because of the display of shackles and torture instruments or the lurid paintings done by one of the survivors. The hardest part is seeing the faces of the victims. Everyone brought to S-21 had their picture taken, numbers round their necks, clamped into a device to keep their heads still for the camera&apos;s shutter. There are rooms of 10-by-eights of dead people, men, women and children, even tiny babies, &apos;discarded&apos; (in the jargon of the interrogators) because of their perceived threat to the paranoid members of the Central Committee.  During the three years, eight months and 20 days of Khmer Rouge rule, around 1.5 million people died, out of a total population of 9 million, an event one writer has described as &apos;auto-genocide&apos;. On the faces of the prisoners of S-21 you see fear, confusion and defiance, but most wear an expression of blank disengagement, a resignation that seems to go beyond the effects of tiredness and hunger, an acceptance that the world they will soon be leaving is filled with horror, and that nothing they could think or do would ever make it change.  Legend has it that when the Khmer Rouge entered Phnom Penh in April 1975, journalists watching from the balcony of the Foreign Correspondents Club left in such a hurry that the people who opened the boarded-up building years later found cameras on the floor, complete with undeveloped images of the fighting. It&apos;s now a restaurant, full of tourists eating club sandwiches and reading their Lonely Planet guides, but it&apos;s still got a view over the Tonle Sap river and is as good a spot as any to watch today&apos;s street life, the vendors pushing carts, cyclo drivers hustling for customers, beefy white men and waif-like Cambodian women getting in and out of tuk-tuks. A dry local joke about the FCC is that it&apos;s the only place where the city&apos;s many NGO workers have to grit their teeth and make conversation with so-called &apos;sexpats&apos;.  Around the country, beside posters warning of the dangers of bird flu and landmines (the bird flu one has a picture of a mother scolding her little boy for playing with a dead chicken), you see an image of smiling children, part of a campaign against trafficking and child prostitution. A second dry local joke has it that Cambodians should thank Gary Glitter for this, the issue having shot up the international funding agenda after the huge publicity surrounding the glam-rocker&apos;s deportation in 2003. Today&apos;s Phnom Penh has come a long way from the haunted, empty place of 1975, when the Khmer Rouge drove its entire population out into the countryside to grow rice. It&apos;s a pleasant city, with bustling markets, elegant colonial-era boulevards, good bars, some startling modernist architecture and an ease and friendliness that will no doubt soon make it one of the most popular destinations in Asia. The incomparable temples at Angkor have long drawn large numbers of tourists, but for years, while the guerrillas were a lurking presence in rural areas and the US and Britain played cold war politics here - helping the genocidal Pol Pot against the Vietnamese-backed government - Angkor was the only place in the country where many foreigners felt safe. Since Pol Pot&apos;s death in 1998, security has returned. Little by little, the minefields are being cleared and the shattered infrastructure rebuilt.  Places that were hard to visit a year or two ago are now accessible, thanks to new roads. Elegant French hotels like Le Royal have reopened, offering visitors a flavour of the Indochina of Andre Malraux and Marguerite Duras. And as Cambodia gets plugged back into the global economy, speculators are moving in. Vietnamese and Korean investors are snapping up beaches and ruined villas. Australian mining companies are at work in the forests. In another five years, much of the country will look very different. Drive out of Phnom Penh and you get a sense of rapid change. Garment factories line the road, which is thronged with motorcycles pulling flat-bed trailers packed with workers, mostly peasants flooding in from the countryside to earn between $30 and $80 a month (the official minimum wage is $45). In the Russian Market you can find branded clothing, some obvious fakes, others the genuine article. Further out into the countryside, boards are nailed to trees, bearing mobile phone numbers. The Khmer Rouge abolished property and destroyed most records. Until recently all land belonged to the state. Now it&apos;s a free-for-all. Anyone who can enforce a claim stands a chance of getting rich.  One place that won&apos;t stay the same for long is the abandoned hill station of Bokor. Built in the 1920s, it was to Indochina&apos;s French elite what Simla was to the British in India, a retreat from the summer heat, a place for intrigue and love affairs. Later it became a Khmer Rouge stronghold: much of the mountain is still heavily mined. To get to the top, you make a bone-shaking 30km climb by dirt bike or 4x4. Bokor is dominated by the melancholy shell of the old casino, which stands on the edge of a cloudy abyss, into which more than one ruined gambler must have thrown himself before war closed the &apos;Bokor Palace&apos; down. Now its bullet-riddled facade is crumbling and the grand hall is a palimpsest of graffiti, mostly the names of European backpackers. Sokimex, the government-linked petroleum company which also owns the ticket concession for Angkor, is reported to have tabled a $100m plan to build a new road, a 300-room hotel, a golf course and 100 luxury villas at Bokor. While there&apos;s no reason to expect Cambodians to live in the rubble of a painful war, Bokor&apos;s gloomy beauty will dissipate when it becomes a 21st-century resort, buzzing with the sounds of electric golf carts and credit card machines.  Similar rumours hang around the south coast resort of Kep. Walk along the paved promenade today, and you pass ornate streetlights and the skeletons of beautiful deco villas, adapted with various degrees of serviceability to lower-income living. At sunset, the place is a ghost of Antibes. It takes half an hour on a narrow diesel-engined boat to reach Koh Tansay, where the fishermen have heard that their island, on which the French built a &apos;motel&apos; (there are no roads) and the Khmer Rouge a re-education camp, is to be the site of a new resort. They do pretty good business, fishing for the famous local crab, frying it with black pepper and serving it to people like me, who come to swim in the lagoon, drink cold beer and watch them mend their nets. They worry, with good reason, that they won&apos;t be able to prove this place is theirs, if someone &apos;high ranking&apos; tries to take it. The night I sleep on the island an electrical storm passes over, sending an hour of heavy rain and intense sheet-lightning, inverting the night sky so the palm trees look momentarily black against a white background. The boats have come in and the crew are watching TV in a hut. It must be an old film. The voice is the one I&apos;ve been searching for in markets, the king of Khmer pop, Sin Sisamouth, who like so many other &apos;new citizens&apos;, urbanites whom Pol Pot wished to reprogramme with the values of the peasantry, disappeared into the black hole of the 1970s. Sin liked the twist and surf guitar. Another Cambodian ghost story. Some things won&apos;t change in the next Cambodia: temples, rice. I see Angkor over Khmer new year, when it&apos;s swarming with families scrambling up the steep stairs to the sanctuary and taking snapshots. Certain figures (gods, busty apsarases, or nymphs) on the ancient friezes have been burnished to a metallic shine by thousands of hands. Guides run through their spiel in front of the giant stone heads at the temple of Bayon, and the kapok trees curl their roots charmingly round the ruins of Ta Prohm.  A few days later I&apos;m scudding on a motor boat down a long irrigation canal flanked by rice paddies. Men and women thresh rice and pack it into sacks. Sullen Vietnamese traders wait in boats to carry it over the border. From time to time we pass flocks of ducks, penned with chicken wire into little enclosures. Groups of men are fishing, carrying their nets through the water, submerged up to their necks, cigarettes clamped between their teeth. Children wave as we go by. Our destination is Phnom Da, a hill with a simple laterite temple, one corner scooped out by a rocket. &apos;B40&apos; says Chamroeun, my guide, who knows more than he wants to about munitions. In 1998, after the mysterious death and ignominious truck-tyre cremation of Pol Pot, the last Khmer Rouge cadres, under &apos;Brother number five&apos;, the one-legged general Ta Mok, made a final stand at an ancient temple complex called Prasat Preah Vihar. Dedicated to Shiva, the destroyer of the Hindu pantheon, it was built between the ninth and 12th centuries by seven successive Khmer monarchs, whose masons hewed out stone stairs and gopuras from a breathtaking peak that looks out over the densely forested mountain range marking the border with Thailand.  Ever since, pilgrims have made their way up, through five successive levels, to the sanctuary at the top. Ta Mok&apos;s troops mined the approaches, dug trenches and mounted guns. After a few months they surrendered. The general, already 80 years old, died of natural causes in 2006, while awaiting his endlessly deferred genocide trial. At Prasat Preah Vihar, he left behind an ornate hardwood table, off which I eat dinner, with the guide and the driver and the driver&apos;s assistants, young men who laugh and chat and greet their friends, souvenir sellers who are packing up and heading back down to their village. Everyone seems relaxed and optimistic. At sunset, up at the sanctuary, a party of Thai monks has come to visit. A school trip, perhaps. Many of them are no more than eight or nine years old. I watch one little boy skip, slightly hampered by his orange robe, past the chiselled names of soldiers who once stood guard on top of the holy mountain. Ta Mok was not the first general to lead his men here. Vietnamese names and regiments are written next to those of the Khmer Rouge. But for now, the monks have the run of the place, to climb over the stones and take pictures of one another. At sunrise I wake up in my tent and climb up again to look at the view. A picnicking family have had the same idea. Everyone seems to be looking forward to the new day. Essentials Hari Kunzru travelled with Audley Travel (01993 838000; www.audleytravel.com).

Terrible aesthetics, miniscule lodgings and vile furniture all justified in the name of functionality. The global chains have become masters in the art of selling business travellers short (for often astronomical prices) but I implore you not to be fooled: a fast wireless connection will never be a substitute for beauty, warmth and character. You wouldn&apos;t design your house around your laptop, so why would you stay in a hotel room that does? Fortunately, the frequent flyer now has a choice \u2013 where all hotels used to look and feel the same, design visionaries (Schrager, Starck and Balazs among others) have radically changed the lie of the land over the last 15 years. The &quot;boutique hotel&quot; \u2013 rich in cutting-edge design, loaded with artistic merit and dripping with aesthetic appeal \u2013 has revolutionised leisure travel over that time.  The discerning jetsetter has stopped frequenting any kind of hotel chain (the Hyatt and Four Seasons excepted) for his precious vacation. The lure of a lodging with immaculate, personalised service, spacious rooms and impeccable design has simply become overwhelming. Businessmen are following suit. Indeed, as a community, I think our mood is changing. A hotel is no longer just for conducting business, executing email and sleeping for six hours. It&apos;s also for pleasure. The pleasure of eating and drinking well. The joy of conducting business or just lounging with clients and colleagues in a beautiful environment. And the thrill of being able to fly in your friends and family for an indulgent, hedonistic weekend. Here are my top ten hotel choices for mixing business with pleasure in the world&apos;s great cities: 1. The Mercer Hotel, New York Is there a better city hotel anywhere in the world? If there is, I haven&apos;t seen it. Gorgeous d\u00e9cor, large rooms (especially for SoHo), fabulous food and extraordinary service. The centre-piece, its understated but much photographed lobby, is the perfect lounge for a working lunch or an exuberant dinner. If you can, book a Loft Studio to sleep in; room 507 is especially brilliant. 2. Park Hyatt, Tokyo If it&apos;s good enough for Scarlett Johansson, it&apos;s good enough for you. The real star of Lost In Translation, this towering masterpiece is the best way of retreating after a bewildering working day in Tokyo. The New York Bar on the top floor is super-hip and the swimming pool/spa, on the 53rd floor, is breathtaking. The Diplomatic Suite, with its own library, dining room and grand piano, is a spectacular way to wow your clients.  3. Widder Hotel, Zurich An extraordinary project that took five years to complete, this Swiss lodging meshes together eight immaculately restored townhouses. No two of the 42 rooms are the same and yet the same philosophy imbues all of them: stunning interiors faithful to the original, historic design plus state-of-the-art technology (Bang &amp; Olufsen stereos are a particular highlight). The hotel&apos;s dog friendliness is an extra bonus. 4. Sukhothai, Bangkok &quot;An oasis of tranquillity&quot; may be a massively overused phrase in travel writing but it is a perfect description of this wonderful venue. The ridiculous hustle and bustle of Bangkok is quickly forgotten on entering the Sukhothai&apos;s beautifully sculpted grounds. Lounging by the pool and pottering around in your vast one-bedroom apartment are bound to be highlights. 5. Murano Urban Resort, Paris Paris is beginning to do boutique better than any other European city. Competition appears to increase by the day, but the Murano is surely still the best. It&apos;s restaurant \u2013 with stalactites hanging from the ceiling \u2013 looks as stunning as the models dining within. And its rooms, to be opened by fingerprint only, are fabulous: the suite with its own swimming pool is the one to book (if you can afford it). 6. Taj Mahal Palace &amp; Tower, Mumbai More grand than boutique, this Mumbai icon still deserves its place in the top 10. The haven of businessmen, politicians and celebrities for decades, the Taj maintains the very highest of standards. Its restaurants serve the finest Indian cuisine, its spotlessly clean pool doubles up as the hotel&apos;s social hub, and its club (Insomnia) is irrefutably the best in India. Best of all, the hotel makes every guest feel truly special.  7. Grand Hyatt, Shanghai The Hyatt delivers again (and remarkably it is a chain). Set on the top floors of the Jin Mao Tower, the highest hotel in the world is also one of its best. I can&apos;t ever remember more scrummy room service or more delightful cocktails. A wonderful base from which to enjoy the delights of China&apos;s best city. 8. The Setai, Miami If you have business in Miami, don&apos;t make the mistake of staying in faceless downtown. Stay on South Beach and enjoy the delights of this spectacular venue. Its funky neighbours \u2013 the Delano and the Shore Club \u2013 tend to try a little too hard, but the Setai strikes the perfect balance. Hip but laidback, its Asian-themed d\u00e9cor is unique in the US. The perfect place to fly your friends and family in for a holiday. 9. Hempel Hotel, London / Dylan Hotel, Amsterdam Anouska Hempel is something of a legend. Both of these signature hotels, splendidly located in Notting Hill and overlooking the Keizersgracht Canal respectively, have set new standards for boutique living in Europe. The gorgeous furnishings \u2013 almost exclusively black-and-white \u2013 are to die for. Never have hotels felt more like home.  10. Chateau Marmont, Los Angeles Built in 1929, this might be the world&apos;s first boutique hotel. The self-styled hotel of the stars, Marmont has a remarkable history \u2013 everyone who&apos;s anyone has stayed there and John Belushi famously died there. In the 1990s it was taken over by Andre Balazs, and the beauty and comfort of its hallowed turf has (remarkably) increased even further. Los Angeles simply wouldn&apos;t be the same without it.", "publicationDate": "2007-05-14T11:58:57Z", "tags": ["Travel", "Hotels", "Business travel", "New York holidays", "Tokyo holidays", "Bangkok holidays", "Zurich holidays", "Paris holidays", "Mumbai holidays", "Shanghai holidays", "Miami holidays", "Los Angeles holidays", "Amsterdam holidays"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/may/10/hotels.business", "title": "Top 10 boutique business hotels", "sentences": ["Sukhothai, Bangkok &quot;An oasis of tranquillity&quot; may be a massively overused phrase in travel writing but it is a perfect description of this wonderful venue.", "The ridiculous hustle and bustle of Bangkok is quickly forgotten on entering the Sukhothai&apos;s beautifully sculpted grounds."]}, {"article": "ON A WIGAN A PRAYER It&apos;s the 54th minute of Sheffield United v Lucky Little Wigan and Danny Webber slips through the most static defence since the Mogadon Users World Cup and smacks the ball against the post. A smidgeon to the right and the Blades stay up. It turns out to be the most valuable inch of wood this side of Ron Jeremy&apos;s preposterous manhood - Dave Whelan can dive into a into a huge pile of TV cash, David Unsworth is able to sustain his bacon grease habit for another year and the Wigan team most folk who don&apos;t live their lives to a Hovis soundtrack have never heard of is still the Warriors. More importantly for Paul Jewell, his managerial stock has risen higher than the Fiver after an 18-hour Pritt Stick session, which means, after his resignation from LLW today, he can probably scrawl a few zeros on the next contract he signs. If the rumours are to be believed, that could very well be at Manchester City, but Jewell insists he needs some time away from the game. &quot;I have made this decision with a heavy heart, but I feel it is time for me to have a break from football,&quot; he said, as behind him Sam Allardyce spent his break from football discussing the lucrative contract he&apos;s almost certain to ink with Newcastle tomorrow morning. Jewell&apos;s story was backed up by his chairman. &quot;He has been really, really struggling with nerves the last few months and that&apos;s not Paul Jewell at all. It&apos;s affected his health,&quot; said Whelan, whose idea of settling someone&apos;s nerves appears to be broadcasting private details of their health problems to the world&apos;s media. Wigan fans, meanwhile, will find flip all comfort in the fact that LLW&apos;s assistant manager, Chris Hutchings, is Jewell&apos;s successor. &quot;I know Chris Hutchings and I know how good he is,&quot; said Whelan. OK, Dave, this is how good Hutchings is: the last time he pounced on Jewell&apos;s sloppy seconds at Bradford he won just one league game in 12, did an excellent job of setting up the foundations of The Bantams&apos; relegation from the Premiership and completed possibly the two worst signings in Premiership history: Benito Carbone and, you&apos;ll like this, one Stanley Victor Collymore. LATE BREAKING NEWS BROKEN BY MANCHESTER CITY OFFICIALS TO BREAK FIVER WRITERS&apos; HEARTS JUST AS THEY WERE READY TO DISAPPEAR TO THE TOILET WITH THE BELLA EMBERG ISSUE OF 70+ And if all that wasn&apos;t enough, Manchester City decided that with the headline-hogging antics of LLW, today is a good day to bury good news - they&apos;ve ended 738 years of goalless football at the Eastlands by sacking Stuart Pearce. City finished the season four points above the relegation zone. &quot;The board of directors would like to thank Stuart for his hard work and service during his six years here at Manchester City and wish him well for the future,&quot; read a club statement. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;We know what we&apos;ve got to address over the summer and what we need to bring to the club over the summer - people with goal-scoring records. We&apos;ll try to do that over the summer. We are aware of what we need to do to improve and what individuals we need to bring to the club to make sure that when I look at the squad list at the start of next season we can say there will be goals&quot; - Stuart Pearce reveals his plan for the close season shortly before his former employers put theirs into practice by handing him his P45. ********************* A GALLON OF ALAN When the BBC Sport website invited feedback from viewers for Inside Sport, the new &quot;weekly sports show which includes exclusive behind-the-scenes interviews with some of the biggest names in sport&quot;, they must have been somewhat taken aback by Jack from Scotland&apos;s brief-but-accurate synopsis: &quot;The show is rubbish.&quot; How else can we explain why the flagging flagship programme - which has so far included such revelations as John Terry being sponsored by a shaving oil, Tim Henman believing that yes, Andy Murray is quite good at tennis, and Sepp Blatter having a shiny new office that is considerably more palatial than the Fiver Towers canteen - should hope to be rescued by a man so dull he celebrated winning the one and only medal of his career by creosoting his garden fence? Alan Shearer&apos;s most notable contribution to Match of the Day this season has been a burgeoning tan that forced Gary Lineker to double his tally of salon trips to two per hour, but Gobby Logan still wanted to hear his thoughts on Lil&apos; Mickey Owen&apos;s future. &quot;Yes,&quot; you&apos;ll hear him say on tonight&apos;s thrilling episode, putting an end to speculation that he is a yes-man for both Newcastle and the BBC. &quot;He wants to get back playing and scoring goals for Newcastle. Lil&apos; Mickey is probably slightly frustrated because he has a contract with Newcastle and if every time he had to come out and say something about the speculation, he would be in the newspapers every day.&quot; Of course, the Fiver manages to squeeze Lil&apos; Mickey in most days even when he doesn&apos;t have anything to say. But before viewers have had the chance to handle that bombshell, Shearer continues apace, displaying the sort of narcolepsy-inducing impartiality you would expect from a pundit for a public service broadcaster - this time on the subject of Big Sam Allardyce&apos;s impending appointment at Newcastle. &quot;Sam is an expert at getting the best out of players. I hope dearly he goes up there and wins a trophy. One thing we can guarantee is he will get money to spend.&quot; \u00a312m across four years to be exact, a higher annual salary than Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Rafael Ben\u00edtez and the Fiver all receive, which should be enough to ensure he maintains his silence with the BBC rather than utter inanities for a living like another leading Newcastle figure we could mention. ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Barcelona, Internazionale and Juventus have joined the search for Frank Lampard, who has been missing in action for about two months. Despite chickening out of taking a penalty in Saturday&apos;s French Cup final shoot-out, Franck Rib\u00e9ry feels brave enough to walk away from Marseille and their volatile fans to shack up with AC Milan. Big Sam will recreate Bolton in Newcastle by luring El-Hadji Diouf, Kevin Nolan, a Reebok factory, the Ye Olde Man and Scythe, Vernon Kay and Crackerjack legend Stu Francis. Mark &quot;Ooh, I could crush a cheeseburger&quot; Viduka will also join the Geordies. The Ged Houllier effect is in full swing in Lyon: star man Juninho wants a move to Qatar, slick winger Florent Malouda&apos;s cavorting seductively in the general direction of Arsenal and the MU Rowdies, as is full-back Eric Abidal, and Alou Diarra wants away to anyone who&apos;ll give him a game. Marlon Harewood&apos;s reward for helping to keep West Ham in the Premiership will be an invitation to sod off to Championship outfit Watford. Middlesbrough are set to beat the Queen&apos;s Celtic and the Pope&apos;s O&apos;Rangers to the signature of Hibs&apos; midfielder Scott Brown, and then cavort around Glasgow in triumphalist fashion just for the hell of it. * * * * * * * * * * STILL WANT MORE? You may have thought Second-Choice Steve, John Motson and the Fiver were tainting the reputation of English football, but Richard Williams reckons Carlos Tevez&apos;s legacy is far more damaging. Ping pong isn&apos;t just for interesting ladies in certain areas of Bangkok, as Steven Wells reveals, it&apos;s the new (old) craze that all cool USAites are playing. Berocca pin-up boy James Richardson and his team of Fiver lackeys discuss relegation, Carlos Tevez, the FA Cup and $exual deviancy in Football Weekly. Schalke have fluffed their lines like a five-year-old in a nativity play in their quest to win the Bundesliga, says bestubbled GU German affairs correspondent Raphael Honigstein. According to Sid Lowe, Barcelona didn&apos;t do much better as late goals turned their Spanish title challenge on its head. And if you thought it was Sheffield United&apos;s ineptitude that saved Plucky Little Wigan from relegation, you&apos;d be wrong. David Pleat says it was - and here&apos;s a line we never thought would appear in the Fiver - Mr Em&apos;s touch and awareness that won the day. * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Sheffield United chairman and Footballers-for-Justice activist Kevin McCabe has donned a metaphorical batman outfit and clambered up a metaphorical Big Ben in a bid to persuade Premiership clubs to pursue court action against the Premier League over its handling of the steamy Carlos Tevez-West Ham affair. Plucky Little Wigan, Fulham, Charlton and Middlesbrough are believed to have already signalled their intention to don super-hero disguises in support of the Blades. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is free to devote himself fully to charismatic punditry on ITV after being released by Championship strugglers Charlton. Newcastle have appealed to the public to keep their eyes peeled for somersaulting Nigerian strikers, explaining that Obafemi Martins has been awol since Saturday. Steve Sidwell is free to devote himself fully to lucrative slogging with Chelsea after leaving Reading. The midfielder is expected to undergo a medical at Stamford Bridge later this week. Duncan Revie, son of United Arab Emirates legend Don, has confirmed his desire to buy Nasty Leeds. And Everton have released big-boned goalkeeper Richard Wright, who is as out of contract as he used to be out of shape. * * * * * * * * * * FIVER LETTERS &quot;Re: Friday&apos;s claim that there had been &apos;reports that Sunday&apos;s game between Portsmouth and Liverpool would be Graham Poll&apos;s last as a referee&apos;.

Did these reports actually exist anywhere other than your poor Purple Tin-addled minds?&quot; - Mark Andrews (and many others). &quot;Someone should point out to Neil Warnock that it&apos;s hypocritical to criticise Alex Ferguson for fielding a team that wasn&apos;t able to beat a relegation candidate at home&quot; - Dave Tong. &quot;In a game bereft of pride and loyalty, I suppose it&apos;s no surprise that Lawrie Sanchez has abandoned Norn Iron One-Nil to take the Fulham job and the considerable dosh that comes with it. How refreshing it would have been, however, if he could have embraced the opportunity to achieve something extraordinary by taking the team he transformed from rag-tag losers to the finals of Euro 2008. Lawrie, there&apos;ll always be jobs available in the bottom half of the Premiership - but the chance to be a real football hero is rare. Sad bloke. Sad world. Sad game&quot; - Bryan Matthews. &quot;Nice to see the legends that are Stiff Little Fingers finally getting a mention in the Fiver, though I can&apos;t help thinking Lawrie taking over at Fulham is a Wasted Life&quot; - Mark Rainey. &quot;Now they&apos;ve won their &apos;relegation 60-pointer&apos; (Friday&apos;s Fiver) against Sheffield Utd, does that mean Plucky Little Wigan are Premiership champions and get to play in Big Cup next season?

John Davies, who has just arrived back in England after being freed from a life sentence in Bangkok, said he had always protested his innocence but had received little help from the British authorities. Davies, who had a labour contracting and helicopter servicing business in Thailand, was arrested in 1990 and accused of heroin dealing. He claimed he had been framed. He was sentenced to death. &quot;Once you&apos;re on death row, the chains are welded to your ankle and they can only take them off with a wheel cutter after they&apos;ve shot you or your sentence is reduced,&quot; he said yesterday. &quot;They weigh about 15kg (33lb) so you&apos;re hobbled as you walk and my legs are scarred for life. Many of the others sentenced with me died before the sentence was carried out because they became so ill. &quot;The normal execution was with three bursts of nine bullets from a machine-gun and you would hear it being carried out,&quot; said Mr Davies, who has a son, daughter and ex-wife in Britain. &quot;One minute the person would be in the cell with you and the next they would be gone, although they have changed now to lethal injections.&quot; Arriving in Thailand in 1972, he was married to a Thai woman who died while he was inside. &quot;On some occasions there were 24 of us in a cell of 26 sq metres and on a couple of occasions the guy beside me died,&quot; he said. &quot;The conditions could be so dirty that I had a small cut on my foot which got infected with tap water and swelled up to twice the size so they thought they might have to amputate.&quot; He suffered a stroke in 1999 and a Thai doctor, in jail for organising the death of his wife, treated him. He spent time in three jails, including Bang Kwang, the notorious &quot;Bangkok Hilton&quot;. Although he said he had been the victim of corruption by people seeking rewards for convictions, he added: &quot;I like Thailand and I like the Thais.&quot; He said that he and other British prisoners received much worse treatment than other Europeans because the embassy and Foreign Office had done little to help them. &quot;I felt totally let down by the embassy,&quot; he said. He claimed that inaccurate information about him had been supplied to the Thais and this had affected his case.

The first clue comes at about 4.30am when a low, distant drone slowly becomes audible - but only when there&apos;s a westerly wind. It&apos;s the first plane of the day - typically a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 - passing at around 4,000ft over my home in south London on its approach to Heathrow airport. It still has eight minutes and 20 miles to fly before it touches down, but by the time it passes overhead the whine of its jet engines is responsible for the 48 decibels of aircraft-related sleep disturbance that the law allows. Just a few minutes or so later, another aircraft will follow in its wake. And another, and another. In total, Heathrow airport - the world&apos;s busiest - manages a daily average of nearly 1,300 aircraft movements. Like all airports, it uses the direction of the wind to determine which way aircraft will approach its runways, as it is safer for a plane to descend into a head wind. Sometimes, as I lie awake at night counting planes instead of sheep, I wonder where each passenger passing over me has just come from. Are they returning from a holiday? Is this their first time visiting Britain? Are they, like me when I go somewhere for the first time, both apprehensive and excited about arriving in a new country and new city? And then I move on to the consequences of all these journeys. How much fuel is needed to fly 60 tonnes of aircraft through the air for many hundreds, if not thousands, of miles? Is flying hundreds of millions of people around the world each year for their holidays really sustainable? And what of the destinations and the people who live there? What impact are all these arrivals having? Fifteen per cent of the UK population now go on three or more flights abroad each year. In 2005, Britons made 66.4 million visits abroad - an all-time record and three times the amount in 1984 - with 81% of those journeys made by air, according to the Office of National Statistics. Two-thirds of all those journeys were made by people going on holiday. And the figures just get bigger as you gaze into the future. When the UK government published a white paper in 2003 aiming to set out the country&apos;s aviation needs for the next 30 years, it predicted that the UK&apos;s airports would need to be able to handle between 350 and 460 million passengers by 2020. That&apos;s two to three times the amount in 2002, and at least 10 times the 1970 figure. Incredibly, it estimated that one-fifth of the world&apos;s international passengers are on flights to or from a UK airport. Aviation demand is not just taking off, it&apos;s soaring out of sight - and the bulk of this future demand is going to be driven by tourists. International tourism, according to the United Nations&apos; World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), is now the world&apos;s largest export earner. It has also become one of the world&apos;s most important sources of employment. Tourism, if you believe UNWTO, is the knight on a charger that could ride forth to save the underprivileged peoples of the world, who should be taking full advantage of the fact that many of them live in places where the world&apos;s rich want to holiday - either sun-drenched, pristine beaches, or countries offering that sought-after cultural &quot;other&quot;. In short, there is a sustainable, healthy living to be made by helping foreign tourists gain temporary sanctuary from the mundane routines of their day-to-day lives. This sounds wonderful in theory, but is tourism really such a global force for good? I decided to visit some of the destinations we all love to go to, places that represent the trends and pressures of global tourism today: climate change, demographic shifts, the maturation and sophistication of holidaying tastes, the widening partition between the world&apos;s wealthy and poor. This is what I wanted to know: what effect does our footfall have on places that are environmentally and ecologically sensitive? How much do the resident communities really have to gain economically from our stay? Above all, just where, as tourists, are we heading, both literally and metaphorically? Tallinn, Estonia Tallinn has been something of a soft touch for invading hordes over the centuries. Just about every nation or clan that borders the Baltic Sea has at one time or another approached the city&apos;s imposing, yet clearly breachable walls - Vikings, Danes, Swedes, Poles, Nazis and Soviets. Poignant dates litter this small country&apos;s history: 1346, when the city was sold by the Danes to the Teutonic Order; March 9 1944, when the Nazi-held city was bombed remorselessly by the Soviets throughout the night; August 20 1991, when Estonia finally regained independence from the Soviets after the so-called Singing Revolution. But a more recent date may come to be noted as a turning point for the city - October 31 2004. This was when the first easyJet flight from Britain landed at Tallinn&apos;s airport. Some feel the city has never been the same since. For around \u00a340 each way, the journey to Tallinn&apos;s medieval old town - a Unesco world heritage site - became instantly affordable to Britons. The state airline, Estonian Air, soon dropped its prices to compete. Before this date, most Britons visiting the city were over 50 and largely interested in culture and architecture. Beyond Tallinn itself, other attractions proved popular: the limestone cliffs at Ontika; the coastal spa town of P\u00e4rnu; the forested and bog-filled nature reserves; and the large islands of Hiiumaa and Saaremaa to the west. But since Tallinn became cheaper to reach it has joined the ranks of European cities that each weekend have to deal with sometimes hundreds of drunk, leery men , singing and stumbling their way from bar to strip club in search of alcohol and sex, under the banner of the stag party. Of all these cities, Tallinn is seen to be particularly vulnerable to this form of tourism as, unlike the bigger cities that these &quot;staggers&quot; head to, the downtown area is little more than a mile wide. In such a small space, the staggers more than make their presence felt. In the shadow of Toompea Castle, just 10 minutes&apos; walk from the city&apos;s medieval heart, I am breakfasting on ham, cheese and rye bread while behind me three British men in their late 30s - the first to emerge from bed out of a group of staggers a dozen strong - talk about the night before. &quot;You&apos;ve got a McDonald&apos;s, bars and a strip club on one street. What more could you want?&quot; asks one. Another switches on his digital camera and begins to show his friends some photographs taken the night before. &quot;She&apos;s a cracker, isn&apos;t she? I&apos;m going to ring her tonight. I think I&apos;m in love.&quot; At the next table, a middle-aged couple from Germany tut under their breath. Later, as the sun drops beneath the city walls, Tallinn&apos;s old town begins to swell with tourists looking for an evening meal. Many congregate first in the bars that line the town square, where the only original Gothic town hall in northern Europe still stands, unchanged since 1429. Within a few hundred metres are most of the bars and clubs frequented by the staggers, with beers on tap and live football on big screens. All of them are packed with men shouting at the screens, singing en masse, or sinking pints. Within a few hours many of them will be making their way to the strip clubs and nightclubs near by. Just five minutes&apos; walk away, I meet Dr Nelli Kalikova in the lobby of the 1930s Scandic Palace Hotel. From 1996 to 2003 she was the head of Estonia&apos;s Aids prevention centre, before deciding to enter politics as a member of parliament. She is outspoken about the rise of these stag parties and, in particular, the fact that a visit to the city&apos;s prostitutes is often part of their itinerary. &quot;The men on stag parties drink like pigs,&quot; she says. &quot;They come here just to buy sex. About 30% of the girls&apos; clients refuse to wear condoms. They pay more for this &apos;privilege&apos;, or they do tricks like pulling it off at the last minute. It is kamikaze sex.&quot; Kalikova says there is a 5% infection rate among the prostitutes in the city when it comes to HIV/Aids, but this is increasing as more and more of the women become drug addicts. And she is convinced that staggers don&apos;t know the risks they are taking. A survey of prostitutes that was conducted in 2005 by the Estonian Institute for Open Society Research paints a picture far worse than even Kalikova suggested: one in every five prostitutes surveyed tested positive for HIV and one in five also suffered from &quot;uncured venereal diseases&quot;. At least 85% of the prostitutes were 30 or under. The stag trips both greatly swell demand and lend a veneer of acceptability to the fact that many of the prostitutes and &quot;dancers&quot; are women trafficked across borders by criminal gangs. Bangkok and Ko Phi Phi, Thailand &quot;We&apos;re just back from China and Tibet,&quot; says Sara. &quot;And before that we were in Ko Pha Ngan for a month.&quot; In the past couple of decades the small island of Ko Pha Ngan in the Gulf of Thailand has become a Mecca for the more hedonistic, party-seeking traveller, a place sold as an alternative to the mass-tourism haunts of southern Thailand such as Phuket and Koh Samui. I am chatting with Sara and Matt on a corner of Bangkok&apos;s Khao San road, a thoroughfare that ranks as one of the world&apos;s major backpacker hubs, attracting hundreds of thousands of travellers a year. They first met in Bangkok a few years ago and now spend periods working intensively at home in Canada to fund their next trip. Sara, 30, first went to Ko Pha Ngan about 10 years ago. &quot;But there are ATMs and 7-11s there now,&quot; she says. &quot;Plus, there are more parties. It used just to be the Full Moon Party on Hat Rin beach, but now there are Black Moon parties and even Half Moon parties. There&apos;s a party every week, basically. The party used to be just on the beach, but now there are jungle parties with dancefloors actually built within the jungle. But I always stay with &apos;my family&apos; when I&apos;m there. They&apos;re a local family that I spent months with when I first visited.&quot; Matt, 27, says change is happening everywhere they&apos;ve been. What, I ask them, is the main backpacker &quot;route&quot; in south-east Asia nowadays? &quot;Everyone is doing the Thailand-Cambodia-Vietnam-Laos circuit now,&quot; says Sara. &quot;No one is doing the overland route from Bali to Bangkok, through Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, any more because of the Bali bombings [of 2002 and 2005]. Laos is like Thailand 10 years ago. It&apos;s the best. There&apos;s a weird place called Vang Vien on the Mekong river. Backpackers sit in rubber inner tubes drinking bhang lassi [a cannabis-laced yoghurt drink that originates in India] and float down the river to bars along the banks where there are TV screens showing The Simpsons and Friends. It&apos;s like being the Swiss Family Robinson, but with beer.&quot; Sara says that from what she&apos;s seen - this is her eighth trip to Thailand - the relationship between backpackers and host communities is getting more and more fraught. There is simply an ever-growing number of backpackers, plus a more diverse range of nationalities, now on the road. On this trip for the first time she&apos;s met Mexican, Indian, Brazilian and Argentinian backpackers. &quot;The locals just seem more tired and cynical these days, especially here in Thailand. I get embarrassed by backpackers yelling at people and speaking down to them. In India and Vietnam travellers always feel they&apos;re being ripped off. We are really blessed to be able to come travelling. But many people don&apos;t think like this any more.&quot; The mourning of a paradise lost, combined with a belief that they alone have experienced the true essence of a destination, is still common among tourists today, but particularly among backpackers, predominantly young travellers taking time out before the leaden responsibilities of adulthood to muse on their future life through the prism of other cultures. This is the script, anyway. But is their journey really little more than convenient cover for one long party under the sun? Even among the voices who speak up in defence of backpacking - as a group sowing the seeds of a global community, and spending money chiefly with local small business along the way - few disagree that backpackers act as &quot;wedges&quot; for tourism to develop in a location. Once backpackers have &quot;found&quot; a place, there is little turning back. Where they lead, others almost inevitably follow. My route from Bangkok to Ko Phi Phi - the isolated islands where The Beach was filmed in 1998 and that remain a backpacker magnet today - takes me through Phuket, Thailand&apos;s biggest island. For many it is a crystal-ball view of what Ko Phi Phi will become: a place of once pristine beach areas that has suffered unchecked development. Ko Phi Phi and Phuket are also part of the much wider area so gravely damaged by Asia&apos;s 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. The ferry from Phuket to the island cluster of Ko Phi Phi takes nearly two hours. My boat joins five others to form a stretched-out flotilla across the warm Andaman Sea. As we pass the iconic giant limestone karsts that pepper these waters, reaching 100m or more into the air, I sit on the bow counting jellyfish and plastic water bottles bobbing together on the sea&apos;s surface. Around me a hundred or so other tourists, a mixture of backpackers and a large Chinese group, top up their tans. I&apos;ve purchased a ticket to the main island of Ko Phi Phi Don, which includes in the price an excursion to its neighbouring smaller sister, Ko Phi Phi Le, where all visitors want to see Maya Bay, a truly picture-perfect cove where Leonardo DiCaprio and others were filmed in The Beach acting out the story of a backpacker community that sought an untouched, off-the-map tropical island all to themselves. But when the boat finally pulls round the high cliff, we find the cove congested with other boats. I count 27 in total - some speedboats, some large passenger boats such as mine - and one of the crew tells me there can be twice this number in high season. The water glistens with a diesel sheen as the crew throw down the anchor. Everyone is offered a snorkel and we are told we have half an hour to spend swimming in the cove before the boat will leave for the main pier at Ko Phi Phi Don. Once I am in the water, it is evident just how lifeless the coral beneath the waves is, though the area lies within Ang Thong national marine park. Someone from our boat swims over to a tiny, empty cove, walk over to a large rock, and leave his mark by urinating against it. As we climb back aboard and passengers dry themselves off, I watch on as discarded watermelon skins, plastic cups and cigarette butts all make their way into the sea. It seems ironic that, at the time, the director of The Beach, Danny Boyle, said: &quot;We got a chance to speak for Thailand, to tell these westerners to go home and stop treating it like a playground.&quot; It&apos;s a short ride to Ko Phi Phi Don. As we travel towards the pier, there is little sign of the damage caused by the tsunami that swept twice over the island&apos;s double-crescent beach, killing more than 700 people. But once off the boat, it becomes evident how much reconstruction is going on. There is also much that is of questionable taste - before-and-after tsunami postcards and &quot;Still Alive&quot; tsunami T-shirts are on sale in shops. Amid the bars, restaurants and shops serving the large throng of backpackers - most of whom are walking around in bikinis or swimming shorts, seemingly oblivious to the fact that the islanders are predominantly Muslim - I meet up with Andrew Hewett, a Briton who runs the Adventure Club dive shop and has lived on the island since 1994 with his Thai wife and their two children. He orchestrated a huge effort by hundreds of volunteer divers to clean the islands&apos; waters of the many tonnes of rubbish that were washed out to sea during the tsunami. He is also one of the most vocal critics of how environmentally damaging the tourism industry has become on these sensitive islands. Hewett has been offering diving and snorkelling trips for years and knows the various reefs around the islands intimately. &quot;The tsunami didn&apos;t actually do that much lasting damage to the reef,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s the tourists who do the real damage. Eighty per cent of divers contact the reef three to five times per dive. Some reefs I knew six years ago have been totally destroyed by people standing on them.&quot; Hewett is proud of the response by many backpackers to the tsunami. Hundreds of volunteers flocked to the islands to offer assistance in the clean-up; many had stayed here before and said they felt an affinity to the place. But he feels this effort is overshadowed by the impact of tourism, even though he readily admits his role in oiling the cogs of change. In 2000, he started offering &quot;shark watch&quot; day trips; soon all the other operators copied him and now it is a &quot;must-do&quot; among the backpackers. Then he came up with the idea of cliff-jumping and mountain-trekking trips, which again were soon copied. &quot;I have to be careful what I offer now, as sometimes I have 30 people in boats following me to see where we&apos;ve gone and what we&apos;re doing. I&apos;m trying to set up a sustainable tourism campaign on the island, but it is very difficult.&quot; Perhaps reducing numbers by increasing prices is the right thing to do? But what is a &quot;fair&quot; price for the privilege of being able to stay here - the few dollars backpackers pay, or the hundreds luxury resorts would charge? If that isn&apos;t a fair way to restrict access, then what is the alternative? In 2006, the Centre for Future Studies, a British thinktank, put forward the idea that some of the most vulnerable tourist destinations on Earth, such as the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, Athens, Italy&apos;s Amalfi coast, Croatia&apos;s Dalmatian coast, Kathmandu and Florida&apos;s Everglades, should be restricted to visitors who have won entrance tickets in an annual worldwide lottery. It would raise both money and limit visitors. Furthermore, it would be equitable and would presumably attract the most passionate of visitors. In small, super-sensitive destinations such as Ko Phi Phi, perhaps this would be a sensible idea to explore. It is certainly questionable just how long they will last otherwise \u00b7 Extracted from The Final Call, by Leo Hickman.  \u00b7 The Final Call is published on June 4 by Eden Projects Books in association with Guardian Books at \u00a312.99.

Cycling in the Netherlands All holidays should clock up as few emissions as is humanly possible, and transport doesn&apos;t get much greener than cycling. Due to the fast-expanding Sustrans National Cycle Network, cycling holidays in Britain are already popular, but for the novice the polders and lowlands of the Netherlands - easily accessible by ferry or train from the UK - offer a gentle, near hill-free introduction to the joys of pedal power. www.holland.com/uk/special/cycling Sailing the west coast of Scotland There&apos;s no point sailing if a lack of wind requires you to rely on a putt-putt outboard motor for your entire holiday. Thankfully, the one thing the west coast of Scotland rarely lacks is wind. Combine that with some of the most striking coastal scenery in the world and you have the perfect sailing holiday. Just remember to support the local economy by frequenting the pubs, shops and eateries instead of always eating on board. sail.visitscotland.com Walking in the Alps With many of the lower ski resorts predicted to have closed within a generation due to fast-rising snowlines, some within the Alpine tourism industry are now desperately seeking alternative sources of income. Summer walking holidays through Alpine meadows and over mountain passes have been popular for decades, but there is renewed interest in them today. High-speed rail links to the Alps are ever improving, too. www.alpseurope.com Camping in Normandy Camping is currently enjoying a strong revival, especially for those with children. The British Isles are covered with excellent places to camp from Cornwall to the Cairngorms, but even cheaper alternatives lie just a ferry or train journey away in mainland Europe. Popular twists on the theme include camping in teepees on farmland. www.campingfrance.com Home-stay in Morocco Morocco is (just) within reach by train, but you really do have to sign up to the travellers&apos; philosophy that the journey should be part of the holiday, too, if you don&apos;t mind spending two days on a train with a short stop-off in, say, Madrid. Even if you fly, Morocco offers plenty of opportunity to stay in places that truly benefit the local economy as well as minimising your environmental impact.

Yet whereas Manchester City reached a clear-cut view three weeks ago that Barton&apos;s alleged assault on his team-mate Ousmane Dabo was unacceptable, the club are struggling to form a rounded opinion of the man currently dangling \u00a3100m before their eyes. It is not difficult to find the huge questions swirling around Thaksin and his money. Google his name and you find two strands of daily news. The first is his proposed bid for City, the fairy-tale solution for a beleaguered club - he would buy City for about \u00a327m, repay the major shareholders John Wardle and David Makin their \u00a320m loans and provide a mooted \u00a350m for players. The other chronicles the eight-month investigation in Thailand into alleged corruption during his five years as prime minister, which is shortly expected to deliver the first criminal charges against him. The proceedings follow the ousting of Thaksin by a military government in a bloodless coup in September 2006 after allegations of corruption and cronyism and mass demonstrations against him in Bangkok. After taking power, the military government set up an Assets Examination Committee to inquire into the allegations and examine the fortunes made by Thaksin, his wife Pojaman and their family. Last Monday, as Thaksin, who is living in exile in London, was stepping up his proposed bid for City, Pojaman was pleading not guilty in Bangkok&apos;s Criminal Court to charges of tax evasion and perjury arising out of a transfer of shares in the family&apos;s telecommunications company, Shin Corp, in 1997. Two of the couple&apos;s children have been hit with a tax bill for $789m (\u00a3400m), which the authorities claim is due from the sale of Shin Corp in January last year. That sale vastly increased Thaksin&apos;s wealth but led also to his political undoing. Having been elected by a landslide in 2001 and re-elected in 2005, his government was credited with introducing some major advances including more affordable healthcare for the Thai poor but he was increasingly dogged by allegations that he was running the country in ways which financially benefited himself, his family and associates. The anti-corruption organisation Transparency International, in its 2006 report on Thailand, said of the country under Thaksin: &quot;Corrupt activities have become highly sophisticated, including conflicts of interest and policy-based corruption. Despite some successes, Thaksin was alleged of [sic] having absolute power, corruption, conflicts of interest, violation of human rights and using inappropriate populist policies to win the rural poor.&quot; There are longstanding allegations of brutality and extrajudicial killings carried out by the Thai police and army in Thaksin&apos;s 2003 &quot;war on drugs&quot; and when putting down an insurgency by Malay Muslims in the south. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International accused his government of failing adequately to investigate the killings, which he denied. Then, in January 2006, Thaksin&apos;s government passed a law which removed a 25% limit on foreign ownership of Thai telecommunications companies. Days later he sold Shin Corp to the Singapore-owned Temasek Corporation, making $1.9bn (\u00a3960m). The prime minister and his family structured the sale so that they paid no tax, which further infuriated opinion in Bangkok and led to massive demonstrations on the streets. An investigation by Thailand&apos;s Securities and Exchange Commission decided there was no illegality, but the country fell into crisis. Thaksin called elections in April 2006 which the main opposition parties boycotted and which were eventually ruled invalid. In September the military seized power. This month the Assets Examination Committee investigators recommended that prosecutors charge Thaksin over a 2003 sale of land in Bangkok, which was owned by a fund attached to the Bank of Thailand. The investigators allege that Thaksin, then prime minister, was responsible for it and so had a conflict of interest - it was sold to his wife. Thaksin&apos;s lawyer, Noppadon Pattama, has denied that Thaksin did anything illegal and said the former prime minister would fight charges if the case went ahead. Seymour Pierce, the merchant bank representing Shinawatra&apos;s bid, maintains that none of this affects the advisability of selling Manchester City to him. It dismisses the proceedings against him because they have been brought by a military government, which is undemocratic and not recognised by the British government. A spokesman for Seymour Pierce, which stands to make considerable fees if the deal goes ahead, said Thaksin&apos;s record had been considered: &quot;The information we have is that Thaksin was a successful and popular prime minister who was removed by a military coup. There are strict rules on money laundering and politically exposed persons, and we and all the professional advisers are satisfied we are able to act for Thaksin Shinawatra.&quot; City promote an identity as a community club, proclaiming themselves &quot;Pure Manchester&quot; on sky-blue billboards in a 2005 advertising campaign, yet appear to see no conflict between that and proposed ownership by the former Thai prime minister. One desire currently overrides everything: money. Having arrived with dreams in their hearts four years ago at a 48,000-seat stadium built by the local council, City have tumbled into gloom. Season-ticket sales have fallen 20%, borrowings stand at \u00a3103m and Stuart Pearce was sacked as manager after his side scored fewer home league goals last season than any top-flight club in history. Wardle and Makin, who loaned \u00a320m mostly to finance Kevin Keegan&apos;s spending before Pearce, want out. City announced at December&apos;s AGM that they were talking to investors, but stories of US businessmen never solidified into a bid. Ray Ranson, the former City full-back, has made a proposal backed by the private equity fund Sisu, which City refuse to entertain. The club seem to have fallen on Thaksin&apos;s bid because he is offering cash. Some fans are dazzled by the mooted millions, but not all. Ollie Goddard, of the Manchester City Supporters&apos; Trust, has spent days researching Thaksin and concludes: &quot;Many of the accusations against Thaksin clearly come from the military government seeking to justify their stated reasons for mounting the coup. But we are still concerned that our club could be damaged by association with him, particularly if criminal proceedings are mounted and he is imprisoned or subjected to huge financial penalties.&quot; From Dr Juree Vichit-Vadakan, secretary-general of the Thailand branch of Transparency International, came a plea: &quot;Yes, we have a military government, but Thaksin was ousted after widely reported allegations of corruption, nepotism and cronyism. British people should think harder whether they want somebody to buy a football club who is surrounded by moral uncertainty. Is money always the most important thing in life?&quot; The answer to that question is expected from Wardle, Makin and Manchester City within the next few days.", "publicationDate": "2007-05-22T23:05:13Z", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2007/may/23/cityblindedbymoneyinrace", "title": "City blinded by money in race to bind Thais", "sentences": ["The proceedings follow the ousting of Thaksin by a military government in a bloodless coup in September 2006 after allegations of corruption and cronyism and mass demonstrations against him in Bangkok.", "Last Monday, as Thaksin, who is living in exile in London, was stepping up his proposed bid for City, Pojaman was pleading not guilty in Bangkok&apos;s Criminal Court to charges of tax evasion and perjury arising out of a transfer of shares in the family&apos;s telecommunications company, Shin Corp, in 1997.", "The prime minister and his family structured the sale so that they paid no tax, which further infuriated opinion in Bangkok and led to massive demonstrations on the streets.", "This month the Assets Examination Committee investigators recommended that prosecutors charge Thaksin over a 2003 sale of land in Bangkok, which was owned by a fund attached to the Bank of Thailand."]}, {"article": "Afternoon everybody. I suppose you&apos;re all winding down for the end of the week right? Drifting through one final afternoon before the clock ticks round to a time when it&apos;ll be ok to race home or head to the pub. Great. Nothing like having a committed and interested audience.

That&apos;s got squat all to do with anything.   56th over: England 235-2 (Vaughan 95 Pietersen 61) GU&apos;s own Baz Glendenning has emailed me this: &quot;Re: the pub at lunchtime: We have a saying in our office &apos;there comes a time when it is easier to explain why you didn&apos;t come back for the afternoon, than explain why you did come back in the state you did&apos;. At 3:15 this afternoon, about half of us made it back.&quot; Oh, sorry, that&apos;s got nothing to do with Baz Glendenning. Apologies Barry. It actually comes from Christopher Tye. Bravo is on here, and his first is a loosener that Pietersen carts to square cover. He takes two from the next and then a single puts Vaughan back on strike with five runs needed for his ton. He doesn&apos;t come close to getting them.   57th over: England 242-2 (Vaughan 95 Pietersen 70) KP slaps four more, these ones speeding past long-on. There is then a long hold up while a tubby old duffer who looks a little like Dickie Attenborough on a bad day wonders around the sightscreen. After much shouting and gesticulating he finally gets out of the way and allows KP to smack two runs out to the ropes at cover. &quot;Surely,&quot; asks Robert Wickes with dry wit, &quot;there already is a player database, isn&apos;t it called Wisden?&quot; A single keeps the strike for KP and increases the seemingly quite likely possibility of him beating Vaughan to his ton.   58th over: England 244-2 (Vaughan 96 Pietersen 72) &quot;What would you suggest they come up with?&quot; inquires Andy Bradshaw, somewhat piqued by my slating of the Schofield report: &quot;We all upsticks and move to a certain Island continent on the other side of the world and start liking to drink Fosters?&quot; Sounds reasonable - it worked for Andrew Symonds. Otherwise let&apos;s rename England &quot;Mighty Blighty&quot; and see how far that gets us. Vaughan inches a little closer with a couple more runs.   59th over: England 250-2 (Vaughan 100 Pietersen 72) &quot;With only a passing knowledge of the ECB and the domestic cricket structure&quot; writes Ken Schofield, sorry, I mean Stuart Bourne, &quot;I could have knocked up the findings of the Schofield report on the back of a travel card travelling from Embankment to Victoria. And without the help of goodness-knows how many &apos;experts&apos;. In a nutshell: do it like what Australia does it. I thank you.&quot; I&apos;ll go out and by some corks to hang from our wide-brimmed hats then shall I? Ohp, hold on, there&apos;s is Vaughan&apos;s hundred - his 16th, and first since Old Trafford in 2005 - and it came with a thick edge that spurted away through fine leg. It earns him a loud round of applause and a bear hug from Kevin Pietersen. A broad grin spreads across his face.   60th over: England 254-2 (Vaughan 103 Pietersen 74) &quot;Why&quot; wonders Garath Strachan, with all the insightfulness that a brain on a hot friday afternoon in the office can muster, &quot;aren&apos;t there enough eyebrows in modern cricket - remember Tony Lewis and Fred Truman proverbially locking their startling bristles in commentatorial combat? No? Well, they might&apos;ve done. Who&apos;s Bumble got? The dull and un-hirsute Nasser Hussain? I don&apos;t think so...&quot; Yes grandfather, it&apos;ll be time to put your dentures in soon. Vaughan essays an immaculate forward defensive as the ball trickles down a yard wide of off stump. He punches the next off for two to the off.   WICKET! Vaughan 103 c Morton b Taylor (61st over: England 256-3) &quot;One of David Lloyd&apos;s eyebrows appears to have left his head and is now on Pietersens top lip.&quot; Nancy Burgess lends new credence to the idea that Lloyd&apos;s eyebrows are actually living, breathing entities of their own, NO! Why have you done that you wally?! Vaughan has tossed his wicket away with a careless rashness that is rather jarring given how he had grafted to get there. It was a dinky little ball, sitting up on middle stump, and Vaughan swatted it away off his hips to backward square, where Runako Morton thankfully accepted the catch. Collingwood is in and imeediately in trouble too as a bouncer spits off the pitch and catches the shoulder of his bat before flying over second slip and away for two runs. An lbw shout roused by a nip-backer looks better to me and the West Indians than it does to umpire Rauf, who shakes his head and walks away.   62nd over: England 263-3 (Pietersen 79 Collingwood 3) KP sneaks a single out to square leg, putting Collingwood on strike. The middle of the over is entirely forgettable, but by the end KP is back on strike, and he&apos;s opened the face of his bat with a late twist of the wrists and guided four runs past third man. &quot;Am I the only person who can&apos;t tell a decent LBW shout from a poor one? I watch the ball, and have no idea where it pitched, hit the pads or was going to hit. I would make a rubbish umpire...&quot; Anton Lawrence, meet Dickie Bird...  63rd over: England 263-3 (Pietersen 79 Collingwood 3) Lessons in foreigh cultures no112a) from Grant Cartledge: .&quot;no one actually drinks Foster&apos;s here in Aus. It is an affectation perpetuated by the marketeers of this wide, brown heap. Believe me, the beer down here is far worse than Fosters...truly! In the first session there was a fight over Yorks. v Lancs. beer. Trust me... (for those who can remember) Watney&apos;s is preferable to the swill they serve down here.&quot; Educational stuff that, I&apos;m sure you agree. It&apos;s a maiden, as Collingwood blocks the hell out of everything with steadfast determination.  64th over: England 275-3 (Pietersen 91 Collingwood 3) KP eases another four through third man, standing up on his backfoot and swivelling a straight bat towards the off side. Bravo, a man who clearly deserves more breaks and a better team in life, sits up a bouncer which Pietersen swats imperiously away over square leg for four. He pushes a brace of twos to opposite ends of the ground - long leg and extra cover - and international cricket has never looked any easier than this.   65th over: England 282-3 (Pietersen 97 Collingwood 4) Collingwood takes one and hopes that no one notices that he&apos;s at the crease. Pietersen, hogging the strike this session like an aging diva taking up camera time in a daytime soap, biffs two to mid-wicket and then strides out to slap a drive through extra cover. Is this a benefit match? I&apos;ve had to reach a way back into my in box to find this, but the ingeniously named Clev Cleverly wonders whether: &quot;considering it is going to leg it down most of the weekend why don&apos;t we declare at 350 and put the wind (no pun intended) up our attack into making things happen.&quot; To which the obvious answer is: that&apos;d be utterly ludicrous.   66th over: England 282-3 (Pietersen 97 Collingwood 4) I didn&apos;t print that last email just to mock it, I&apos;m just wondering why Clev, like so many of you, is totally convinced that it is going to hammer down with rain all the way through this weekend? Collingwood continues to make this look like the toughest of matches at the other end, playing out a maiden with ferocious dead-bat intensity.  67th over: England 293-3 (Pietersen 102 Collingwood 10) And that is KP&apos;s quickest-ever Test match century, off just 104 balls. He brought it up with a neat little glance that trundled the ball down to an unprotected fine leg. Clev Cleverly&apos;s suggested sudden declaration seems to be gathering a few admiring glances, not least of all from the promisingly monikered Muggins Senior: &quot;In the interests of getting a result out of this match (and, indeed, this series) England should declare now. If the pitch is as flat as all that, then both sides can block out until the rain hits (as it will, according to the forecast, from Sunday onwards). If the Windies are rabbits and we can bowl, we can win from here. If we try to build up a follow-on-enforcing target, and then fail to, it&apos;s a draw&quot; and you may or may not like to shout him down depending on how apathetic this heat is making you feel. Collingwood doubles his tally with an edge that just beats second slip on it&apos;s way to the ropes and then.... dropped him! Another edge flies off the bat and shoots quick and low to second slip&apos;s right hand, but it bounces back out of his palm and tumbles down onto the turf.  68th over: England 305-3 (Pietersen 103 Collingwood 21) Collymore is reintroduced to the torment of bowling to Pietersen as a loosener is spanked away to mid-wicket for one. Collingwood tucks into some of the left-overs with a neat little glance down to fine leg for four and now he&apos;s motoring along at a lick too. He punches two pastcover, swivel-pulls another one out to leg and Collymore generally has the look of a man who&apos;s thinking: &quot;sod it. I&apos;ve had enough of this already.&quot; And, given that he&apos;s eased Collingwood into vigorous form, and that KP is on 103, who could really blame him for that?   69th over: England 309-3 (Pietersen 104 Collingwood 24) In reply to my query of over 66, John Starbuck quips: &quot;Because some of us watch weather forecasts when sober.&quot; As though I made a habit of getting very drunk and staying in to watch Michael Fish tell me what&apos;s what weather wise this weekend. I don&apos;t. I rely on a large boil on my left knee, which throbs severely when atmospheric pressure increases. Sadly, as I&apos;m often drunk I often fail to distinguish this throbbing from the lingering pain of banging my leg into my own face when I trip over my own feet. I do this frequently.   70th over: England 311-3 (Pietersen 105 Collingwood 25) The Headingley crowd is brought to a seething and volatile state by the presence of a troop of Morris dancers on the boundary&apos;s edge. They are bombarded with empty cups and verbal abuse as though they were actually German stand-up comics telling jokes about life in the 1940s. I really must try to fit some cricket into the next of these entries.  70th over: England 315-3 (Pietersen 105 Collingwood 29) &quot;I actually think Mr Cleverly&apos;s idea has some merit.&quot; Not me, this, but one Phil Harrison, &quot;Maybe not declare now but they should try and get the Windies in before lunch tomorrow given the forecast. That&apos;s the kind of brave, outside the box thinking we pick Vaughan for isn&apos;t it?&quot; Meanwhile KP has tripped over his own fett as though he were a drunken Andy Bull trying to climb his own front door step. He&apos;s not, he&apos;s just Kevin Pietersen trying to get back into the non-striker&apos;s crease in time to avoid being run out. The three stooges stuff is catching: Sarwan is down and out on the ground at long-off. He&apos;d been chasing down a straight drive from Collingwood, reached it a foot before the rope and bent over to flick it back infield before tumbling arse over head onto his right shoulder and whumping into the boundary hoarding. Four runs are given, and Sarwan is down for some length of time. It looks pretty bad - looks like he&apos;s put it out, possibly. Ganga takes over as captain and the Windies could now have lost their two best batsmen for this Test, which would pretty much mean thay&apos;ve disappeared down the creek.   WICKET! Collingwood 29 c Gayle b Collymore (71st over: England 316-4)  Interestingly, and unusually, Ganga is quite a strident replacement captain, and immediately starts waving his arms around and re-positioning the field. And, to be fair, Sarwan had pretty much run out of ideas here anyway. &quot;I can&apos;t help but think that the Windies are missing a trick by not turning back the clock and recalling Otis Gibson to add to his two test appearances. He&apos;s currently got 9 wickets for Durham in the match against Yorkshire, plus 71 with the bat. Despite his 38 years, he would add some penetration to the toothless Windies attack being probably the only Caribbean still playing with genuine pace.&quot; I&apos;d agree with Alex Wright, and only have half my tongue in my cheek as I did so, if Corey Collymore hadn&apos;t just shown that you don&apos;t need pace all the time: he&apos;s landed an absolute gem on a fullish length and just swerved it away from Collingwood&apos;s outside edge, nipping it neatly off his bat. Gayle took the catch and Ian Bell is in.   73rd over: England 321-4 (Pietersen 106 Bell 0) Powell bungs five wides down leg. &quot;Not wishing to spoil the mood, but a cricket thought has occurred: KP has only ever scored 158 in Tests (several times, I think). It will be interesting now to see if he has the temperament to go on and make a really big score... My money&apos;s on him ending his career as the best Test batsman never to score a double ton.&quot; Charlie Wilson is far from the only person to question KP&apos;s ability to get to 200. Frankly, it doesn&apos;t bother me at all. There have been many great batsmen who never scored double centuries in Tests: it&apos;s a question of prolonged concentration, which is far from being a necessary component of a quick-scoring batsman&apos;s game. As Dennis Compton said of Brian Lara&apos;s 375: &quot;I couldn&apos;t possibly bat that long, I&apos;d get bored and fall over.&quot;   74th over: England 328-4 (Pietersen 107 Bell 4) Collymore beats Bell&apos;s outside edge with a jaffa that swings some six inches off the pitch. Bell watches intently, and adjusts. The next one is slightly too short, and Bell cuts it down the hill for four runs.   75th over: England 328-4 (Pietersen 107 Bell 5) Just two balls to go in this over and I&apos;m really struggling to think of what there is to say about it. Damn. Too late. A maiden.   WICKET! Bell 5 c Ramdin b Collymore (76th over: England 329-5) Timothy Muller has provided the kind of hard rebuttal to this double-ton matter - oh he&apos;s gone too! Bell is out! This is a great spell from Collymore, he&apos;s really settled into a lovely groove here. That was so similar to the one that got Collingwood: fullish, and swinging away till it snicked off the bat and slid through to the &apos;keeper. Just an absolute jaffa orange, that one. Straight from the packing crate. These look to be tougher circumstances for Prior to bat in now, his straight-batted aggression will mean that he&apos;ll find the swing difficult to counter.   77th over: England 335-5 (Pietersen 113 Prior 1) Sarwan is confirmed as having suffered a damaged shoulder, though how seriously we don&apos;t yet know. Just realised that I had some half-finished thoughts in that last over. Yes. Timothy Muller has provided the kind of hard rebuttal of whether KP needs to get a double-ton or not by saying: &quot;Who cares about KP getting 200. Jason Gillespie did; Allan Border didn&apos;t. Who would you rather have at number five?&quot; Prior&apos;s first run comes as he squeezes out a yorker away towards mid-wicket.   78th over: England 337-5 (Pietersen 114 Prior 2) Pietersen strolls a single with a push square out into the off. Prior is indeed looking a little too straightforward to find the gaps in the field here. He does take one, pushed out to square leg. Anton Lawrence kindly takes a moment to inform me that: &quot;Geoff Boycott has just said that they have &quot;idiots in Yorkshire, just like they do down South&quot;! Can you imagine such a thing? Northern Idiots!&quot; The mind boggles.   79th over: England 343-5 (Pietersen 116 Prior 8) I&apos;ve handed this over over to Phil Sawyer: &quot;This sudden tumble of wickets could work to England&apos;s advantage. I can&apos;t see them being bold enough to declare in time to bowl the Windies out twice before the rain hits, so maybe being bowled out for around 400 would be just the ticket. Then Sidebottom redeems the family name and swings his way to glory like Sinatra in his prime. Or maybe it&apos;s just the tin talking (hic).&quot; Good thing I&apos;m on tomorrow so we can begin a series of 1001 jokes and observations about Ryan Sidebottom that you really don&apos;t need to know. Otherwise I&apos;d have had to fit them all in to today&apos;s play. Prior flicks away four runs through mid-wicket with a good-looking lean to off, accompanied by a swish of his bat across the line.   80th over: England 349-5 (Pietersen 117 Prior 10) &quot;Don&apos;t want to be picky, but didn&apos;t Allan Border get 200* against England back in the day?&quot; points out Tom Hopkins, &quot;Always good to ruin a perfectly reasonable point with some rank pedantry.&quot; a quick check reveals that yes, yes Allan Border did indeed have a highest Test score of 205. Which does indeed ruin everything. The new ball is now due, which means we can all move swiftly on and a few steps nearer to the end of the working week.   81st over: England 349-5 (Pietersen 117 Prior 10) Chris Gayle is brought on, so I think we can assume that the new ball hasn&apos;t been taken. Spoilsports. We might say the same about Charlie Wilson, who seems put out that he&apos;s been rebuffed with some flagrantly untrue facts: &quot;Whilst I take Muller&apos;s point (over 77), I&apos;m going to don my anorak to point out that Border scored 205 vs NZ in the Melbourne Boxing Day test 1987, and, appropriately, 200* vs England at Headingly in &apos;93. I&apos;ll get back in my box now.&quot; Gayle has hustled through all this too quickly for me to clock what he was up to. No doubt it was as close as slow off spinning ever gets to blaxploitation.   82nd over: England 355-5 (Pietersen 122 Prior 11) Mango John in Bangkok would probably get printed just for having that name, but he ensures his place in the afternoon&apos;s OBO with this helpful nugget: &quot;The best Test batsman never to score 200 was Tyke legend Herbert Sutcliffe. He did OK, I suppose, ending up with an average of over 60, and which no other Englishman has yet bettered.&quot; Hmmm, I wonder what Pudsey&apos;s finest would have made of all this at Headingley today hey? What he&apos;d make of KP&apos;s decision to step across outside the off and walk down the pitch to whip a good delivery away through mid-wicket for four?   83rd over: England 362-5 (Pietersen 128 Prior 12) Pietersen practically raises his open palm up to his brow and stares out into the middle distance towards extra cover, all in admiration of a fantastic drive for which no one, batsman or fielder even bothered to move as it sped away across the turf.   84th over: England 363-5 (Pietersen 129 Prior 12) Bravo returns. He&apos;s serving up some floated wider balls, seemingly inviting KP to hit drive. He should know by now that KP needs no invitation. He cracks all of them to various parts without ever picking out the boundary ropes.   85th over: England 366-5 (Pietersen 130 Prior 13) Everyone is walking around wasting time in an effort to make this the last over of the day: KP fiddles with his gloves, Prior does some gardening, Ganga talks to Gayle at length and the adjust and readjust the field: it&apos;s not just the OBO readers and writers who want to get to the pub. The Windies stick in a leg slip, who fails to save a bye that Gayle hurls down that direction. A couple of singles and... Prior blocks the last. That is stumps.   A long hot day comes to a close with England in much the better position. That said, two wickets tomorrow and England&apos;s innings is as good as over already. We&apos;ll see, will KP push on to beat his best score? Can Prior emulate his heroics of the First Test? And exactly how much will Ryan Sidebottom&apos;s ten-wicket haul cost? Find out here tomorrow.

The late-night decision against Thai Rak Thai (TRT) - the country&apos;s biggest party - banned more than 100 of the party&apos;s senior executives, including Mr Thaksin, for five years. It threw Thai politics into further confusion after an earlier verdict spared the Democrat party and its executives when they were cleared of similar charges in a verdict that took hours to deliver. Police set up checkpoints at key junctions across Bangkok yesterday and 13,000 troops were on standby for trouble after the ruling by the nine-judge panel established by the military-appointed government which took power in a bloodless coup last September. There were fears of a prompt reaction by supporters of the TRT which remains popular among the poor, many of whom have suffered just as the economy has suffered since the junta took power. Last week Thailand&apos;s revered king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, took the unusual step of warning in a televised address that the stability of the country depended on the fairness of the tribunal&apos;s judgment. All day long yesterday several hundred TRT supporters gathered on the steps of the party&apos;s headquarters in Bangkok as the lengthy judgment was read out and beamed on large screens. But when the Democrats, Thailand&apos;s oldest party, were cleared of six counts of cheating in last year&apos;s April 2 vote, even the TRT faithful cheered and burst into song, hoping the ruling was a harbinger of what lay ahead for their own party. &quot;This is not the last day of Thai Rak Thai, brothers and sisters,&quot; party spokeswoman Laddawan Wongsriwong told a distraught crowd of 1,000 people at party headquarters which hissed and booed at the verdict. The constitutional tribunal cleared the Democrats of slandering Mr Thaksin&apos;s party and of using a smaller party to violate the rules governing the controversial snap election which was boycotted by the opposition. Shortly afterwards the poll result was annulled. But TRT was not given the same lifeline. It was found guilty of bankrolling obscure smaller parties to run against it in constituencies where there was no opposition to get around laws requiring a minimum voter turnout. Judges ruled that two key party members, former defence minister Thammarak Issaragura na Ayuthaya and former transport minister Pongsak Raktapongpaisal, were guilty of breaking electoral laws to ensure the TRT returned to power swiftly. Ahead of the verdict Mr Thaksin, who has not returned to Thailand since the coup and has set up home in London, urged his supporters to accept the court&apos;s verdict and maintain calm It was unclear last night how the decision to disband TRT and ban its leaders would affect the general election which the junta has pledged would take place in December. However, Thailand&apos;s law does allow members from the party to reform under a new banner and they could yet contest the poll if the uncertainty does not set back the timetable.", "publicationDate": "2007-05-30T23:01:49Z", "tags": ["World news", "Thailand", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/31/thailand", "title": "Political ban raises tension in Thailand", "sentences": ["Police set up checkpoints at key junctions across Bangkok yesterday and 13,000 troops were on standby for trouble after the ruling by the nine-judge panel established by the military-appointed government which took power in a bloodless coup last September.", "All day long yesterday several hundred TRT supporters gathered on the steps of the party&apos;s headquarters in Bangkok as the lengthy judgment was read out and beamed on large screens."]}, {"article": "George Bush has a history of making visionary speeches which come to nothing. But nothing quite prepared his G8 partners for the proposal he made yesterday on climate change. Six days before they are due to meet in Heiligendamm on the German Baltic coast, to discuss climate change among other things, Mr Bush called on 15 nations, the world&apos;s major emitters of greenhouse gases, to reach a consensus in the next 18 months on a global emissions goal. It would be up to each nation to decide how to meet that target, if and when it was agreed. The meetings would be convened by the US, which would take over the process of controlling emissions. Mr Bush called his proposal a contribution to the debate on climate change - and it is quite something that he is now admitting that there is a problem. But other G8 countries had other ideas. One senior European official, furious at the hijacking of Germany&apos;s G8 agenda, called the announcement a poison pill. Greenpeace called it a classic spoiler. It is not difficult to see why. The process, if it came to pass, would bypass the UN search for a new international treaty to regulate emissions to replace the Kyoto protocol when it expires in 2012. Kyoto is the world&apos;s only international treaty that compels countries to act. If a replacement is not found soon, emerging carbon markets, seen as the most effective means to limit emissions, will collapse. For an active adherent of the Kyoto process such as Germany, this could negate most of what has already been painfully achieved. Carbon dioxide emissions in Germany are 18% below those in 1990, or just 3% off its Kyoto target of a 21% reduction by 2012. Germany says the aim must be to achieve a 40% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2020, double the European Union target. This makes sense scientifically. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the influential UN panel that met in Bangkok last month, said the world could have as little as eight years left to avoid a dangerous global temperature rise of 2C or more. Even this temperature rise would leave billions of people short of water by 2050. But to achieve even this modest target would require a global reduction of emission of 50% by 2050. The two-degree target is therefore central to current scientific thinking on mandatory emission caps. The big US corporations such as Dow, General Electric and General Motors have seen the writing on the wall, by endorsing a 60% to 80% reduction by 2050. An increasing number of US states, such California, are committed to deep mandatory cuts in carbon emissions now. But not the US president, who wants goals, without specifying how they would be met, at some distant date in the future. The argument is not just about what the world&apos;s biggest emitter signs up to. China and India were exempted from the first round of Kyoto cuts. Both countries wanted to be involved in the post-Kyoto process, but only if Washington played ball. Mr Bush has no time for mandatory emissions caps, which he claims would damage the US economy, and his negotiators have persistently tried to frustrate the search for a successor to Kyoto. At talks in Montreal last year US negotiators walked out when the idea of setting global goals was raised. Tony Blair yesterday hailed the inclusion of a global goal in Mr Bush&apos;s speech as a huge step forward. Mr Blair said that this was the first time America was saying it wanted to be part of a global deal. But what deal? A deal that puts emphasis on finding new technologies rather than concentrating on energy conservation and zero-carbon housing? The fossil-intensive approach developed by the US and Australia has no chance of reducing emissions to the degree needed. It has little chance of reaching an agreement by 2008. But it has every chance of blocking the current attempt to find a multilateral solution through a UN conference which starts in December.", "publicationDate": "2007-05-31T23:09:54Z", "tags": ["US news", "World news", "Environment", "Climate change", "Kyoto protocol", "Global climate talks"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/01/comment.usa", "title": "Leader: Climate change", "sentences": ["The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the influential UN panel that met in Bangkok last month, said the world could have as little as eight years left to avoid a dangerous global temperature rise of 2C or more."]}, {"article": "Over the past 16 years, Dorothy Sheridan has received an MBE; an honorary doctorate from the Open University; and a fellowship at the Royal Society of Arts. All three honours came as recognition of her expertise in a job for which she would lack the correct qualifications had she applied today. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t employ an archivist now without a postgraduate diploma,&quot; says the head of special collections at the University of Sussex. The employment market was rather less regulated in 1974, when she arrived back in Brighton after living in Scotland for two years with her first husband Tony, an experimental psychologist, and their young son, Luke. &quot;I&apos;d recently joined the Women&apos;s Liberation [Movement] and I was determined to get a job, even if it was part-time,&quot; she says. &quot;Luckily, a friend told me that she was leaving her post at my old university, where she&apos;d been working for an &apos;eccentric professor&apos;, she said. All I had to do was be able to type and know something about the second world war. Well, I couldn&apos;t type and, perhaps because of my Irish upbringing, my knowledge of the war wasn&apos;t as good as it should have been.&quot; None of this seemed to matter to the eccentric professor, Tom Harrisson, a well-known anthropologist whose work had taken him to the pubs and dance halls of northern England before, during and after the second world war to observe the working classes. His main concern during Sheridan&apos;s interview was that his beloved Mass Observation archive should look good on television. &quot;A BBC camera crew was coming to film it for the Horizon programme,&quot; she says. &quot;So the first thing he asked me was &apos;Can you write labels?&apos;&quot; Having established that she could, Harrisson got Sheridan to label umpteen boxes &quot;Sex&quot;, &quot;Money&quot; or &quot;War&quot; - depending on their contents. &quot;I got the job because I did what I was told and had nice handwriting,&quot; she says, throwing back her head and chuckling.

Sheridan returns to her desk with a rather guilty grin and says: &quot;I&apos;m getting good at delegating.&quot; At Sussex, Sheridan has had eight staff since her role expanded from looking after Mass Observation to overseeing collections such as Rudyard Kipling&apos;s letters; the scripts of Frank Muir and Denis Norden; the New Statesman archive; the personal papers of Virginia and Leonard Woolf as well as other members of the Bloomsbury group; and the jottings of the Sussex folk singer Bob Copper. There are numerous other collections, all of which are kept in what look like rows and rows of shoe boxes in a vast, clinical room adjoining the university library. The only sound in this space is the thrum of powerful air conditioning, maintaining a constant temperature of 16-18C. &quot;It can seem a bit nippy when you&apos;re in there for any length of time,&quot; Sheridan says. &quot;But that&apos;s the best temperature to preserve what are often fragile documents.&quot; The room next door is warmer and much smaller, but even quieter. You could hear a pencil drop on to one of the blue-grey carpet tiles. And pencils are all that archive users are allowed to bring in, just in case they are tempted to make indelible marks on valuable papers. Sheridan says she likes the atmosphere of order and calm. &quot;I was always quite a tidy, organised person. I wrote a diary from the age of 11 and I was a great one for keeping records.&quot; The tidiness, she says, was a reaction to her chaotic upbringing by bohemian parents who, in 1950 when she was two, came to London from Galway, before moving to the Yorkshire Dales. With three children - Dorothy was the oldest - the family lived in a succession of primitive cottages. &quot;The toilets were outside,&quot; says Sheridan, with a shudder. &quot;And there was no running water. Dad pumped it from various wells. He was an artist and folk singer and I sometimes appeared on stage with him. My parents were politically active CND members. I remember being taken on the Aldermaston walks and various demos. But the family began to split when I was about 16. Eventually, there was a very bitter divorce. I just wanted to get as far away as possible. That&apos;s probably why I chose to do sociology at Sussex.&quot; Forty years on and her father&apos;s guitar is attached to her study wall. One of his line drawings is framed nearby. John Sheridan died last year, having survived into his 80s. Her first boss at Sussex was not so lucky. Harrisson was in his sixties when he died in a car crash in Bangkok in 1976. Shortly before leaving for Thailand, he had given Sheridan \u00a3100 to buy a car and learn to drive. &quot;By that time, he was living with a Belgian baroness in Brussels most of the time,&quot; she says. &quot;But he wanted me to be able to drive him around when he was on this side of the Channel. Unfortunately, 100 quid didn&apos;t get you much in the way of car and lessons, even in the 70s. Anyway, he died before I could do anything about it and I ended up buying a motorbike instead. When I rode to work, I used to think &apos;good old Tom&apos;. &quot;Harrisson was domineering and opinionated, but I was attracted by his eccentricity. If he&apos;d been at Sussex more often, we would probably have clashed. As it was, my job was to look after him when he came over and to ring him every Wednesday. In those days, that meant booking an international call. I had to use my faltering French to persuade his Belgian maid to bring him to the phone so that I could tell him what had come in the post and who had wanted to use the archive.&quot; One person who was restricted in his access to the archive was Arthur Marwick, the Open University&apos;s then eminent professor of history. Harrisson was adamant that Marwick should not be allowed in during the afternoons in case he had been drinking at lunchtime. &quot;I had to lie through my teeth and tell Arthur that we were only open in the mornings,&quot; says Sheridan. &quot;Tom was also obsessed with the notion that students might break in and make love between the shelves. On reflection, I think he was projecting.&quot; The Mass Observation project, which Harrisson started with the poet Charles Madge and the film-maker Humphrey Jennings, has just marked its 70th anniversary. And Sheridan has unashamedly used this milestone to milk as much publicity as possible. &quot;Our profession is moving away from its traditional scholarly roots,&quot; she says. &quot;We&apos;re more like information professionals now. We have to justify our existence by ensuring our archives aren&apos;t the preserves of an elite. Mass Observation was created by the people and needs to be open to everybody.&quot; In 1981, Sheridan set about reviving Mass Observation as a way of finding out what the British were thinking and feeling about a wide range of domestic and social issues. More than a quarter of a century later, a panel of 500 volunteers are being asked to share their experiences of violence in the home and to vent their feelings about the new smoking ban in pubs. Some will reply by letter, others by email. The internet and the ongoing process of making collections available digitally has helped to make them much more accessible. &quot;But I still need good &apos;front-end&apos; skills to promote it through talks and exhibitions,&quot; she adds. During the Brighton Festival this month, Sheridan spoke on the subject in front of 2,000 people at the town&apos;s Dome. They&apos;d come to see Victoria Wood talk about her life and her play - Housewife, 49 - a spinoff from one of many books based on the Mass Observation archive. Sheridan herself has edited or coedited several books - much of the work for which she has done at home in her study strewn with family memorabilia. &quot;I&apos;m usually up at five in the morning and in here going through my emails,&quot; she says. Her job has grown somewhat in 33 years. Having nice handwriting and doing what you&apos;re told are no longer the prime qualifications.

I have mild epilepsy, which has been well controlled for a few years now and for which I take regular medication. My concern is whether I will be able to take enough supplies of medication with me and how to replace it if necessary. Will I need some sort of doctor&apos;s letter in case there are prob- lems with carrying large numbers of pills into a country? And what hap- pens if my rucksack is lost and I have to replace my medication quickly?  Name and address supplied I got lots of helpful advice from Epilepsy Action (0113 210 8800; epilepsy.org.uk). You should be able to get three months&apos; supplies in advance. Once that has been used up, providing the drug is available in the country you are in, you can get a prescription from a doctor in that country, taking a copy of your pre-prescription from the UK. (They also recommend carrying a doctor&apos;s letter to be on the safe side.) If the drug is not available, the process is more complicated.  The country you are visiting needs to have an import licence for the particular medicine. You can check this with the company that produces what you take or through Idis (www.idispharma.com). With a licence you can arrange a consignment to be sent directly to you in that country, though you will require a delivery address, such as a friend willing to accept the delivery.If the country you&apos;re in doesn&apos;t have an import licence, you should still be able to bring personal supplies in, but you will not get any more.  It&apos;s a good idea to separate some of your medication and keep it away from your main rucksack \u2013 then if this is lost, you will at least have some time before you need to get replacements.  I enjoyed the article on &apos;High Style in the Alps&apos; (13 May) but am looking for a more traditional escape for my parents&apos; ruby wedding anniversary. I want to book a long weekend for them somewhere in the Alps where they can do some short walks, enjoy nice restaurants and there are a few things to do. Their anniversary is in August and I have no idea where to send them. They enjoyed holidays in Switzerland before they were married. Could you give me some advice? Jo Hastie, Teddington Unsurprisingly, there are plenty of areas of Switzerland that fit the bill. Recommended by Switzerland Tourism (0800 100 200 30; myswitzerland.com) is Chateau d&apos;Oex in the Lake Geneva Region. It&apos;s a small resort with walking trails close to Gstaad (Bernese Oberland). There&apos;s plenty of choice of chalets and hotels at chateau-doex.ch. Another tip is the Gruy\u00e8re district (la-gruyere.ch) in the Fribourg canton. The picturesque medieval towns and villages are set in gentle hills which are ideal for walking. In Gruyere, Hostellerie Saint-Georges (00 41 26921 8300; st-georges-gruyeres.ch; doubles from \u00a375) is a stylish and cosy 14-room inn serving superb modern cuisine. Crystal Lakes and Mountains (0870 888 0252; crystallakes.co.uk) can help with more suggestions for Switzerland. We&apos;ve recently booked flights to Laos for the end of December involving a 17-night stay in the country. I&apos;d read that visas issued on arrival were for 15 days only but that they were easily extended. However since then I&apos;ve read lots of conflicting advice regarding extensions and wonder if you know the up-to-date situation. Liz Kingdom, Exeter Visas valid for 30 days are available in advance from the Laos embassy in Paris (00 33 1 4553 0298; ambalaoparis@wanadoo.fr; Laos has no UK representation) for \u20ac50 - send cash - and take 10 days to be processed. You can also pick these up in Hanoi or Bangkok if you are passing through on your way to Laos. Otherwise, 15-day visas are issued on arrival. The latest experiences of travellers on Lonely Planet&apos;s Thorn Tree discussion forums suggest that getting an extension is as straightforward as visiting visa offices in Vientiane in the morning, stipulating the number of days you require to extend by and picking up your passport in the afternoon. Regulations are subject to change, so it&apos;s worth an email or call to the embassy a month or so before you go to confirm these arrangements if you intend arriving without a visa. We&apos;re looking forward to going on our first cruise this summer. The company we&apos;ve chosen does not include tips in the fare, saying that they are &apos;at the customer&apos;s discretion&apos;. We would like to budget accordingly, but have no idea who we should tip and how much. Is there a tipping etiquette? Mary Hamilton, Wetherby, W Yorkshire You should tip your cabin steward and, if you are served by the same waiter every night, you should tip the waiter, assistant waiter and, if you wish, the wine waiter. Put the cash in envelopes and hand them out on the last night. Budget on $10 per passenger per day, split between these three or four people. Suites on some ships come with a butler and concierge service, and the suggested tipping rate is an additional $4 per guest per day. On many cruises you can eat in a different restaurant each night. In this case, leave a tip at the end of each meal (unless a service charge is automatically added to the bill). On the majority of cruises, a 15 per cent service charge is automatically added to drinks bills and beauty treatments.", "publicationDate": "2007-06-03T22:06:09Z", "tags": ["Travel"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/jun/03/escape3", "title": "Ask Tom", "sentences": ["You can also pick these up in Hanoi or Bangkok if you are passing through on your way to Laos."]}, {"article": "For 20 years I was always viewed as a slightly weird eccentric for promoting the idea of climate change. Now one is mainstream I&apos;m not sure if that feels like a good thing or not. You can&apos;t make people good by an act of parliament, but you can make it easier for them to be good than to be bad. My father [the Dean of Rochester] tried to live by the basic concept of leaving things better than you found them. As a Christian, that always seemed a pretty good starting point.

As a family we have an annual carbon audit, and we offset everything. I don&apos;t regret giving my daughter a beefburger during the BSE crisis: it was the truest thing I could do and say, given all the evidence I had.

The words Conservative and conservation have never been far removed. I&apos;m entirely in favour of what Cardinal Keith O&apos;Brien said about politicians and abortion. It is a moral issue. Catholics do have to say it is a question of murder. Human life is always sacred. There is a perfectly clear connection for me between opposition to anything but moral war, to capital punishment, and to abortion. Under Labour&apos;s proposed planning laws, I can quite imagine becoming a new Swampy. I have no opposition to women priests. But I left the Church of England at that point because it became a sect. Up until then it had no doctrines of its own, only those of the undivided Catholic Church. With women priests it changed that. It decided it knew better. Margaret Thatcher was a great leader. But I think Ted Heath was in many ways the most important leader of the last century, because he did the thing that mattered: took us into Europe. I am not a puritan.

The most dramatic improvements were in work-based training. There the adequacy rate has risen from 40% in 2001 to 90% today and 59% of apprentices are successful. It was wonderful to see skills and learning at work taking centre stage in government policy. However, I could not forget that the transformation was from a very weak start back in 1997. The usually unsung heroes were the further education colleges, pretty good then and better now. It was a real pleasure to report that they were getting to grips with employers&apos; needs. The arrival of Train to Gain has been taken as a new opportunity to serve business customers rather than a threat. What now seems to have gone from the colleges is that depressing sense of being embattled. When I started inspection in 1993, my 70-odd further education charges in the south-east were a very mixed bag. The Hampshire sixth-form colleges were a star turn then, as they still are. The marks of strong local government were on them, forming a coherent system the lack of which remains one of the most vexing obstacles elsewhere. There were some outstanding further education colleges: Basingstoke, Eastbourne, Farnborough, South Downs and the rest. But there were also many struggling to come to terms with their incorporation, which released them from local authority control. Several had utterly failed to cope with the labyrinth of European Social Fund financial regulations and were cataleptic, waiting for the police to call. At others we could see an appetite for the corporate life in the principal&apos;s BMW and the welter of franchised Professional Association of Diving Instructors courses; a similar enthusiasm for corporate governance was often lacking in these colleges. The first signs of new-build were to be seen, but nothing like the explosion of decent modern accommodation we find in every town today. It was a newly-fledged and very tentative sector. Those who stuck to the knitting were still safe and sound. Those who explored the farthest edges of the incorporation envelope sometimes came a terrible cropper. There was something pathetic about century-old municipal institutions describing themselves as the &quot;Cinderella sector&quot;. Sometimes I felt like telling governing bodies to get up off their knees. Time to evolve We should not be surprised that it has taken 14 years for incorporated further education to mature. It has happened while the whole idea of social enterprise, the shifting, melting borderland between public and private, has evolved. The nature of government is changing, on the road to who-knows-where. Is it any wonder that some public colleges made mistakes, took wrong turns? But all that, I felt as I wrote that last glowing report, was in the past. I had watched the award of a grade 1 for leadership and management to Warwickshire college. Quite right too. The grading debate had revealed how students&apos; achievements had carried on steadily rising while the college grew into a five-campus national frontline player: takeover after takeover without the management team&apos;s grip on quality ever slackening. That is terrific management in anybody&apos;s terms, the kind of thing any private equity raider would be proud to achieve. I had listened while Ruth Silver told a rapt audience in Bangkok about the range and variety of things Lewisham college does. I kept saying &quot;Wow!&quot; to myself. &quot;That&apos;s clever!&quot; The creativity of the best colleges, dreaming up new ways of delivering services, is a million miles away from the agonies of a decade ago, when we tried to persuade principals that one intake in September really was a little fossilized. What we have now is a further education sector ready to make transformational change; from good to great. There are straws in the wind at Manchester and Luton, where Manchester College of Arts and Technology (Mancat) and Barnfield college are about to take academies into more exciting, less controversial territory, as the means of radical change in complete inner-city schooling. Allied with Darlington&apos;s educational village concept, and colleges&apos; participation in specialist diplomas, college-led academy programmes have the potential to offer guaranteed progression for inner-city five-year-olds right through to university. Estelle Morris was right to call for elimination of unnecessary transfer shock. College-led academy programmes have the power to spread a curriculum umbrella over the whole of childhood and adolescence with no false turns, no dead ends, no need for kids to vote with their feet anytime from age 11 onwards. In essence, the big, bold, FE college can now help deliver the coordinating role where local authorities should have led, with the advantage of being inside the education provider tent, alongside the schools, There are more straws in the wind blowing over the 157 Group. Its 25 colleges have \u00a31bn a year of spending power. What can they not do with it if they have the will? Who else is going to take self-regulation and make it into responsible autonomy, with service guarantees to learners and accountability to government as strong as they are today but a great deal less cumbersome? What might \u00a3250,000 each, an affordable fee in businesses that size, create by way of quality assurance and improvement? Whether all of them know it or not, the further education colleges have reached a land where every prospect pleases. Nobody is holding them back. No longer need they gatecrash the Prince&apos;s Ball; tomorrow they will be throwing one of their own. \u00b7 David Sherlock was chief inspector of Adult Learning.

A public school dropout who, by the mid-1980s, had wound up as a destitute heroin addict on the streets of Bangkok, he was back in England after being deported from Thailand and realised that he needed to get &quot;a proper job&quot;. It wasn&apos;t easy, Saville says, but after almost two decades of drifting and drug addiction, he got fit, stopped taking heroin and was soon working at a large needle exchange for addicts at St Mary&apos;s hospital in west London. At the age of 38 he had &quot;finally found a niche&quot; that would set him on the path that would take him all the way to his current roles as executive director of the drugs charity Release and sought-after drugs commentator. Describing himself as &quot;pretty renegade-ish&quot; with an entrepreneurial bent, Saville says that having had first-hand experience of serious drug addiction has greatly influenced how he approaches his work. His life before becoming a drugs worker sounds a bit like a 1970s road trip memoir. At 16, he was hitchhiking around the world &quot;to the usual places&quot;, experimenting with drugs. He made intermittent money as a model, tried his hand at acting, rode a horse across Brazil, and went to California to seek his fortune - all the while dabbling in drugs. His freewheeling, wandering lifestyle came to a halt in the late 1970s, however, when he was lured by the thrill of &quot;freebasing&quot; - or crack cocaine as it is now known - which was taking off in California at the time. His descent was rapid, he says, leading him to Thailand, where &quot;heroin was cheap&quot; and where he eventually ended up in jail before being sent home by the Thai authorities. It was a miserable existence, Saville admits, but not one without valuable lessons. &quot;To survive as a drug addict, especially on the streets of Bangkok, is a tremendously difficult thing to do,&quot; he says. &quot;It really draws tremendous resources in a human being.&quot; Of the period when he finally began working in England, he says: &quot;Because I&apos;d missed out on forging a career, like most people in my 20s and early 30s, I&apos;d do double time for everybody else. I&apos;d be first in and last out.&quot; Break with protocol The hard work paid off. At St Mary&apos;s, Saville reacted to a shortage of needles in the NHS due to a strike by breaking with protocol and finding them elsewhere. It was, he says, an early indication of how the entrepreneurial skills necessary to survive on the streets as a heroin addict came in handy as a professional. &quot;I thought: &apos;We can&apos;t stop.&apos; So I went to a private firm in the city and negotiated a million syringes and supplied the needle exchanges.&quot; At Turning Point, where he went next - starting off as a team leader for &quot;one outreach worker in Harlesden&quot; but over six years building one of the biggest drugs services in London - his individualistic style also paid off. &quot;I think there was always a slight tension in the relationship, but they saw that what they got was good attention. On a couple of occasions, they did try to micro-manage me a bit, and that wasn&apos;t very productive.&quot; What he did not want to do, Saville says, &quot;was build a career [on the back of drugs]. I think I wanted to be a success in the field without using that. It&apos;s only recently that I have come out about this. A lot of people will read this article and say: &apos;Sebastian used drugs?&apos;&quot; It is a poignant time for him to &quot;come clean&quot;. Next week, he will chair a Release conference marking the 40th anniversary of the charity that was not only in the vanguard of treatment for addicts when the idea was unheard of, but which has maintained a reputation as a small but valuable asset in the drugs treatment landscape. &quot;Release&apos;s main job is providing support and expertise on the law to marginalised people,&quot; Saville says. &quot;These are people with entrenched, long-term problems - such as debt, housing, domestic violence. If we can provide help to unravel some of these, surely that is a good thing?&quot; Saville took up his post as executive director of Release in June 2003 when, he says, &quot;it was in a mess&quot;. He received a call from the charity for help, applied some of his &quot;entrepreneurial&quot; style and, following eight months of working for nothing, had started the process of turning it around. &quot;I started freeing up some frozen grants, getting private sector money in, building up the website again.&quot; Four years later, Saville is still there and he has consistently used his position as a platform to make what he regards as vital points in the debate about drugs that cut through some of the misconceptions - not least of which, he says, is the value of Release itself. He speaks freely, and in the firing line is the government. &quot;Who is going to be paying [Release] salaries in three months? After 20 years of support, the Home Office decided they weren&apos;t going to support Release any more. A thousand people inquire here a month,&quot; he says. &quot;A thousand!&quot; He despairs that the government is &quot;putting \u00a36m&quot; into an advertising campaign for its own drugs helpline, Frank, which, he says, calls Release when its advisers cannot help callers with their problems. &quot;If Release closed its helpline tomorrow there would be a huge vacuum in service provision. We are the only organisation that has the level of expertise on drugs and the law under one roof.&quot; So what did the government do when he told it this? &quot;Shrugged their shoulders.&quot; He says New Labour has done some positive things for drugs services, but he is disappointed that it appears to pander to a populist agenda. &quot;Like many people, when the Labour government was elected 10 years ago we thought it was going to be a breath of fresh air. If anything, it&apos;s worse.&quot; It is worse, Saville suggests, because rather than admitting that &quot;drugs will always be here&quot; and that they are a health issue, the government has chosen to talk about &quot;tackling&quot; the problem and has over-egged the relationship between drugs and crime. &quot;The whole drug agenda is: &apos;If it doesn&apos;t reduce crime it&apos;s no good&apos; and the rights and wellbeing of the individual is not important. This inevitably will lead to failure for every government because you are never going to get rid of drugs.&quot; Political suicide And it is not that politicians do not understand what he and others in the field are saying, Saville insists; it is that many are &quot;terrified&quot;, because to argue against the status quo would be &quot;political suicide&quot;. So what can campaigners expect? To hope for &quot;grand&quot; policy changes &quot;would be naive&quot;, he says, adding that the best that can be done is to &quot;keep chipping away&quot;. Meanwhile, what matters, says Saville, is that services are available for people with drug addiction and that they acknowledge their complex needs. He says he is determined to try to keep Release afloat and get the message on drugs across as effectively as possible. Indeed, he is currently working on a documentary about drug use that he hopes will be &quot;the Fahrenheit 9/11 of the war on drugs&quot;. The forthcoming anniversary conference will, Saville hopes, keep some of the burning issues around drugs centre stage, from medicinal use of cannabis to drugs in the criminal justice system. He also hopes it will help draw attention to another issue of which he has had personal experience. In 2006, Saville was tested for hepatitis C and, after a year of gruelling treatment, was finally given the all-clear last month. If his past has informed his approach to work to date, the diagnosis has made sure it will do so in the future, albeit differently. He says: &quot;I&apos;m maybe more relaxed now. I probably don&apos;t have that obsessive need to do five things at once any more.&quot; But it does not herald a change of style. Saville says Release will not &quot;keep banging&quot; on the government&apos;s door for money but rather that he will continue to follow his own, slightly impatient &quot;entrepreneurial&quot; route to success. &quot;I never thought I&apos;d get to 40 - never mind do this,&quot; he says.

Please mister, can you spare me 20p? Ah&apos;m Chelsea Football Club and I ain&apos;t got a penny. I knew the good life once, but the wheel o&apos; fortune ain&apos;t been in ma favour: I was duped into squanderin&apos; my last few coppers, 320 mil or so, on a few shiny pieces of silver and now I ain&apos;t got a pot to do ma steaming fizzle in. Please help me mister! That, give or take 747 further references to himself, was the thrust of the Special One&apos;s latest considered oratory today. You can always rely on him to produce more rubbish than a self-facilitating bin-dipping node, but he reached new levels of ludicrousness by whingeing about Chelsea&apos;s lack of money, the fact that nobody else gets criticised for spending \u00a3320m and failing to win Big Cup, and even the fact that Cromwells Madhouse isn&apos;t bigger than Top Man. &quot;It is very difficult to win every competition but I don&apos;t understand why people put this kind of pressure on Chelsea and not on the others,&quot; he said, emerging triumphantly from a skip clutching two used cigarette butts, a can of White Lightning and Claudio Pizarro. &quot;People ask Chelsea, last season you won two trophies; why did you not win four? But not many journalists ask Rafael Benitez and Arsene Wenger, why zero? And not many people ask the MU Rowdies, why only the Premiership?&quot; On he went, as the Fiver took leave of its eyeballs with a sharpened coathanger. &quot;Is it about money? If it is, I hope that next season the media put pressure on the big spenders because the big spenders for sure will not be Chelsea. The big spenders will be Liverpool, the Rowdies, Tottenham.&quot; That&apos;s the same Tottenham who are 150-1 to win next season&apos;s Premiership, compared to Chelsea&apos;s 6-4. And we all know that the bookies, like Walter Sobchak, are never wrong. Mourinho, however, seems to think he has been asked to win next season&apos;s Premiership with a few embryos, a copy of the Bosman ruling, an empty KFC Bargain Bucket and Paulo Ferreira. The Fiver, from its Pomposity and Pontification Fence, reckons that either Mourinho a) has gone off on one yet again like the clown he is or b) is ostensibly talking rubbish but is actually using shrewd waste management to ramp up a siege mentality that enables Chelsea to play at their absolute best. Either way, you&apos;ll like the next quote. &quot;Young players are a little bit like melons - only when you open them up and taste the melon are you 100 per cent that it is good,&quot; he said, as sales of white coats went up by 54%. &quot;Sometimes you have beautiful melons but they don&apos;t taste very good; other melons are a bit ugly and when you open them the taste is fantastic. The way Scott Sinclair played against Arsenal and the Rowdies - we know the melon we have.&quot; Chelsea have a complete melon all right.

Plucky Little Wigan manager Chris Hutchings has signed Sweden defender Andreas Granqvist from Helsingborg for an undisclosed fee.

In future, please could you publish a health warning if including quotes from Alan Shearer&quot; - Patrick O&apos;Connor. &quot;I noticed in Sid Lowe&apos;s column that he mentioned there is a Spanish term &apos;Zamora&apos; which means a &apos;goalkeeper with the lowest goals conceded-to-games-played ratio&apos;. Does Sid know that in England the term &apos;Zamora&apos; refers to a &apos;striker with the lowest goals-scored-to-games-played ratio&quot; - Oliver Pattenden (and 1,056 others). &quot;I want to know more about African game dates (Paul Jurdecza, yesterday&apos;s Fiver letters).

Lalas is deluded!&quot; - Teresa Smith. &quot;I&apos;m curious to see how the four clubs named in the Stevens Report can be &apos;fully exonerated&apos; as claimed by Alex Adams (yesterday&apos;s Fiver letters). After all, who actually transfers these players and where on earth does he think the money comes from to pay the agents? Suggesting that these clubs do not profit in any way from the actions of agents is far more ludicrous than the Fiver labelling the clubs in question &apos;the usual suspects&apos;. But not as ludicrous as taking the findings of this report seriously&quot; - Tom Hammett. &quot;Alex Adams might like to reflect on the fact that Lord Stevens queries 17 or 18 transfers and yet only five clubs are involved. The agents in question have done business with all the other Premiership clubs on dozens of occasions and yet those transfers are not mentioned.

A group of drunk Indians decide to go for an &quot;English&quot; at the end of an evening&apos;s drinking in Mumbai. One demands &quot;the blandest thing on the menu&quot;, the women cluck over the waiter&apos;s &quot;lovely pasty skin&quot; and the head of the table orders 24 plates of chips, ignoring well-meaning advice that &quot;you might have ordered too much&quot;. The sketch endures not just because it puts the post-pub curry crowd bang to rights, but also because of its utter preposterousness: what Indian in their right mind would choose an overcooked carvery over a feast of brightly coloured, piquant delights? Yet despite Indians nursing a well-deserved feeling of culinary superiority, you would be wrong to assume that this self-satisfaction means that in India everyone just eats Indian. Likewise Chinese in China, Thai in Thailand and just about everywhere else the world over. From Bangkok to Brest, Beijing to Barcelona, gastronomic globalisation - led depressingly by McDonald&apos;s, with its 26,500 branches in 119 countries - has meant that few culinary cultures are hermetically sealed. In India, people often go for a Chinese. Or rather, an Indianised version of Chinese that some call Chindian. Dishes tend to be flavoured with spices not normally found in Chinese cuisine, such as cumin, coriander and turmeric. Given India&apos;s large vegetarian population, paneer, cauliflower and potato are also far more prevalent, along with garlic, ginger and chillis. Popular Chindian dishes include Manchurian chicken, which has a sweet and salty brown sauce, various Sichuan recipes and Hakka noodles. Narrow and flat, almost square in shape, Hakka noodles are made with durum wheat, with or without eggs. They are stir-fried with vegetables and mixed with a hot, vinegar-based sauce, and sold from dhabas (roadside stalls). The name comes from the Hakka people, the tribe of Chinese who first moved to Calcutta in the late 1700s. There is still a large Chinatown in Calcutta today. &quot;Indo-Chinese is very popular with middle- and upper-class Indians,&quot; says Tishani Doshi, a writer and dancer based in Madras. Much to her amusement, Doshi recently had her first Indian meal in Britain and was surprised not to have encountered a single dish she had ever eaten in India. &quot;It&apos;s probably how a Chinese person would feel eating at a Chinese restaurant in India,&quot; she says. &quot;I couldn&apos;t believe how heavy the &apos;Indian&apos; food was in London, and it reminded me of the feeling I often get when I go for a Chinese back home: completely stuffed and slightly bloated. I can&apos;t imagine that Chinese people regularly eat anything that heavy.&quot; So if the Indians eat Chinese, what about the Chinese? Given China&apos;s size and population (1.3 billion people at the last count), tastes obviously vary hugely from province to province. Alex Lee is an American-born Chinese who lives in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province in southern China. He says that the most popular restaurants are American chains such as KFC and McDonald&apos;s - but with a twist. &quot;They have changed the menus,&quot; he says, &quot;to accommodate Chinese tastes. You will have things like a seared Xinjiang spiced chicken sandwich from McDonald&apos;s or a fried chicken burrito \u00e0 la Peking duck style, with scallions and hoisin.&quot; Wine consultant Fongyee Walker lives in Beijing and says China is so vast that, especially for the less well-off, &quot;foreign&quot; simply means food from another province. &quot;Here in Beijing, the poorer city residents will eat such &apos;foreign food&apos; as Sichuan snack food,&quot; she says, adding that food snobs in the city like to complain that the Sichuan influence has wrecked the food in northern China. &quot;Also popular are the low-level Xinjiang snacks - such as sticky dried fruit cake and lamb kebabs and nang bread - which come from the far west but are so popular they&apos;re almost part of the local scene.&quot; But, she says, pizza is widely eaten in China, adding that even her staunchly traditional ayi (maid) occasionally dines at Pizza Hut. &quot;The pizza isn&apos;t what you would call a real Italian style - they definitely prefer the deep-pan approach,&quot; she says. Walker recently met a woman who moved to Beijing from Italy 20 years ago and runs an Italian cheese factory called Ji Kang Food in the outskirts of the city. Italian cuisine also goes down well in Japan. A survey in Japan-guide.com found that the majority of respondents&apos; (33%) favourite restaurant meal was Italian, compared with just 21% saying sushi. And the genre breakdown at a restaurant review website such as Asku, which covers eateries all over the country, shows just how the Italians, along with the Chinese, are dominating the culinary scene. In Tokyo 2,681 Chinese restaurants are listed, alongside 2,169 Italian, plus some 491 classed as &quot;spaghetti/pizza&quot; restaurants. Pizza, it would seem, is loved almost the world over. But what do the Italians themselves eat when they venture away from their own cuisine? The stereotype is that they are conservative where food is concerned and that anyone above the age of about 30 views foreign food - which may mean dishes from a neighbouring town or just anything not cooked by their mamma - with the deepest possible suspicion. Rome-based food writer Maureen B Fant says that while this is of course a sweeping generalisation, it remains largely true. &quot;I grew up in New York, and we used to say I feel like Lebanese, or I feel like Chinese, or let&apos;s see what that Persian place is like,&quot; she says. &quot;You don&apos;t get that here. The few &apos;ethnic&apos; places still tend to be either greatly diluted for Italian tastes, or holes in the wall that cater for new immigrants.&quot; However, exotic ingredients are creeping into the more creative kitchens, she says, &quot;And there definitely are more exotic places than there used to be. But if we&apos;re talking about mainstream trattorias and restaurants, when you want a change from the local fare, you&apos;re still (for now) more likely to think Sicily or Sardinia than Asia.&quot; This sort of culinary exclusivity is often associated with France, but according to recent research, the favourite dish of the French is not coq au vin, escargots or even steak-frites, but couscous. A survey commissioned by the French weekly magazine VSD asked 960 people to arrange a series of dishes in order of preference. Though the list was overwhelmingly composed of traditional French dishes, such as b\u0153uf bourgignon, bouillabaisse and beef tartare, couscous came out top. Not only that, but the dish has become a symbol of modern, multicultural France - indeed a conservative politician once described the wave of North African immigration as &quot;conquest by couscous&quot;. Nigh on every town in France has at least one couscous restaurant, where immigrants and locals join to eat cheap bowls of the stuff. Missing from all this culinary cross-pollination is British food. But there are some brave souls who are determined to take some of our national dishes international. And one of the most ambitious must be Manju Malhi, who grew up in London and, from next month, will be presenting a cookery series on British food, such as shepherd&apos;s pie and bangers and mash, for India&apos;s largest commercial television channel. &quot;Curry has become so popular in Britain, I thought I&apos;d swap it around,&quot; she said recently. &quot;I cannot name one English restaurant in Delhi and I wondered, why so? People here think that English food is bland with meat and nothing else. I am trying to show them that there is good cooking in the UK as well.&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2007-06-20T22:51:27Z", "tags": ["India", "China", "Japan", "Life and style", "Food & drink", "World news", "Travel", "Food and drink", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/20/india.china", "title": "Helen Pidd on eating 'foreign' food in India China and Japan", "sentences": ["From Bangkok to Brest, Beijing to Barcelona, gastronomic globalisation - led depressingly by McDonald&apos;s, with its 26,500 branches in 119 countries - has meant that few culinary cultures are hermetically sealed."]}, {"article": "The ousted Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra was charged with corruption for the first time today, on the same day as he took a step closer to gaining control of Manchester City football club. After months of accusations by the military junta, prosecutors formally accused Mr Thaksin, 57, of illegally helping his wife to buy a piece of prime land in Bangkok at a bargain price from the Bank of Thailand after other bidders withdrew from the auction. The billionaire former prime minister has been living in exile, mainly in London, since he was deposed in a bloodless coup - amid a flurry of corruption allegations - while out of the country last September. Within hours of the charges being announced, the board of Manchester City accepted Mr Thaksin&apos;s \u00a381.6m bid to buy the club after accepting financial assurances from him. Mr Thaksin favours the former England coach Sven Goran Eriksson to lead the club. A panel of nine judges from Thailand&apos;s supreme court now has until July 10 to decide whether to press ahead with the charges. Over the past week, a committee set up by the military-appointed government to investigate corruption allegations against Mr Thaksin has frozen around \u00a3900m in assets raised from the sale of his telecoms empire. The Thai justice ministry has already ordered him to return from overseas by June 29 to face charges of concealing his assets. The prime minister, Surayud Chulanont, gave assurances his predecessor would be safe, but the army chief, Sonthi Boonyaratglin, warned that he could be a target for assassination. The coup leaders are under mounting pressure to come up with hard evidence against Mr Thaksin, as the corruption allegations were among the prime justifications for his overthrow nine months ago. The charges relate to a 772m baht (\u00a311.3m) land deal by the former prime minister&apos;s wife, Pojaman, in 2003, during his first term of office. Mr Thaksin, who faces 10 years in jail and a 60,000 baht fine, denies the charges. His lawyer and unofficial spokesman in Thailand, Noppodol Pattama, said he was considering whether to return, but with 12 other corruption allegations under investigation it seems unlikely he will do so. Mr Noppodol said that Mr Thaksin still had enough money outside the country to finance the purchase of Manchester City.

Above all they are crazy about the English Premiership, which is broadcast throughout the season with repeats for top-up fixes during the week. But allegiances do not stray much beyond the &quot;big four&quot; of Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool. Even Everton, whose shirt sponsors are Thailand&apos;s Chang beer brand, do not get much of a look-in. What hope, then, for Manchester City? The club&apos;s imminent acquisition by Thailand&apos;s exiled former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, might normally earn only a uninterested yawn. Yet Thaksin is such a divisive figure in a land where he was thrown out of office that even a City bid arouses passions in ordinarily reticent Thais. For his diehard supporters, gaining control of an English club is a great day for Thailand: national pride will be restored as the country strides on football&apos;s world stage, with home-grown players perhaps even getting a chance to showcase their talent as a result. The flip side is that other Thais are equally adamant their erstwhile premier is merely seeking another platform since he has been robbed of the national political limelight. For them, snatching an English club - even City - is the desperate act of a desperate man. At best it is a money-grubbing business venture for the billionaire telecoms tycoon; at worst it is a publicity stunt. Predictably the bloggers have weighed in. &quot;Thaksin has a huge ego and that is probably the reasoning behind his plans for Man City,&quot; writes &quot;Steve Suphan&quot;. &quot;Nothing political, just an idea to promote his name.&quot; Certainly Sittisak Ruangcharoen, 25, a telecoms manager and Manchester United supporter, harbours suspicions about Thaksin&apos;s motives. &quot;Not many care about Manchester City,&quot; he said. &quot;I know he&apos;s interested in football, but I think it&apos;s just another business deal for him. Perhaps he also wants the attention since he was thrown out of power.&quot; Although Dew Sumonchate, 25, a DHL courier service clerk, is a similarly devoted Manchester United fan she sees things through a different prism. &quot;This is great, because it will make people around the world think differently about Thai people,&quot; she said. &quot;They&apos;ll not think we&apos;re poor and backward if he pulls this off.

Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a military coup in his homeland nine months ago, tabled an \u00a386.1m offer to buy Manchester City, with the aim of reviving the glory days of one of England&apos;s best supported clubs. The present City board is recommending its shareholders accept the offer, but supporters, although anxious to secure Mr Thaksin&apos;s millions to spend in the transfer market, expressed concerns about his colourful background. After months of accusations by Thailand&apos;s ruling junta, prosecutors yesterday formally accused the 57-year-old of illegally helping his wife to buy a prime piece of land in Bangkok at a bargain price from the Bank of Thailand after other bidders withdrew from the auction. Mr Thaksin has been living in exile, mainly in London, since he was deposed in the bloodless coup while he was out of the country in September amid a flurry of corruption allegations that split the country between those who loved him and those who loathed him. If the Manchester City deal is approved and Mr Thaksin passes the Premiership&apos;s &quot;fit and proper person&quot; test, the club will become the eighth in the league under foreign ownership. There is speculation that even more clubs could become targets of overseas interest as the trend started by the \u00a3140m sale of Chelsea to the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich in 2003 intensifies. Investors are increasingly lured by a heady mix of the prestige and glamour of the league coupled with the unprecedented \u00a32.7bn global TV rights, which means that next season&apos;s champions will win \u00a350m and the bottom club \u00a326.8m even before selling tickets and merchandise. Manchester City&apos;s board, headed by chairman John Wardle, accepted financial assurances from Mr Thaksin yesterday, claiming the offer would &quot;deliver the on-field success we have been striving for&quot;. Mr Thaksin&apos;s favoured choice to become City&apos;s manager is former England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson, who could have \u00a350m to spend on new players to elevate the fortunes of a club that last won silverware in 1976. It finished 14th in last season&apos;s Premiership, while arch rivals Manchester United claimed another title. City, currently \u00a360m in debt, have pledged 55.9% of the shares - those owned by members of the board and former chairman Francis Lee - to Mr Thaksin. If he were also to obtain the 9.9% owned by the only other major shareholder, Sky, he would have 65.8% - close to the 75% threshold where he could take the company off the stock market. Mr Thaksin plans to become chairman with his son and daughter joining the board,. But before he can sit in the directors&apos; box at Manchester City&apos;s Eastlands stadium, attention will switch back to Bangkok. A nine-judge panel of Thailand&apos;s supreme court has until July 10 to decide whether to press ahead with charges that he allegedly flouted a bar on politicians being involved in the sale of state assets. Over the past week a committee set up by the military-appointed government to investigate corruption allegations against Mr Thaksin has frozen about \u00a3900m of assets raised from the sale of his telecoms empire. Earlier this week the Thai justice ministry ordered him to return by June 29 to face charges of concealing his assets.

The charges relate to a 772m baht (\u00a311.3m) 2003 land deal by the former prime minister&apos;s wife, Pojaman, during his first term. Mr Thaksin, who faces 10 years in jail and a 60,000 baht fine, denies the charges. His lawyer and unofficial spokesman in Thailand, Noppodol Pattama, said Mr Thaksin was considering whether to return. A further 12 corruption allegations against Mr Thaksin are under investigation. Mr Noppodol said that Mr Thaksin still had enough money outside the country to finance the purchase of Manchester City, but according to records of his assets filed while the prime minister, only about \u00a3200m remains unfrozen. The roller-coaster ride in Mr Thaksin&apos;s fortunes will be a new experience for the Thai of Chinese descent. A former policeman, he won a scholarship to study criminal justice in the US, returning to Thailand to set up in business. During the 80s he built up a telecommunications business that was boosted by cornering state monopolies. The business that became Shin Corp turned into an empire that was sold to the Singapore state investment arm, Temasek, for a staggering \u00a3950m last year. But along the way Mr Thaksin&apos;s ambitions outgrew commerce and in 1998 he founded the Thai Rak Thai party that from a standing start swept to power in 2001. It governed for an unprecedented full four-year term and was re-elected. In the impoverished Thai countryside, Mr Thaksin&apos;s debt relief schemes and cheap medical care won him legions of friends who have yet to desert him. But the metropolitan elite viewed his concentration of power with outrage and used the tax-free sale of Shin Corp as a catalyst for street protests that proved his eventual undoing. In Manchester yesterday Alan Galley, chairman of the City supporters&apos; club, said the deal could represent the &quot;light at the end of the tunnel&quot;. But he added there was still a &quot;big question mark&quot; over what would happen if Mr Thaksin was found guilty in Thailand. The former prime minister, however, pledged his &quot;utmost commitment&quot; to the club&apos;s future success and expressing a &quot;determination to take the club back to its rightful place at the highest level of competition in both the FA Premier League and European football&quot;.

Buenos Aires (139th) The city that prides itself on its air of European sophistication - and until a decade ago had prices to match - is now the cheapest in South America. For the visitor, that means you can enjoy superb restaurants, hotels, nightlife and shopping for daft prices. Stay at The Cocker (thecocker.com, doubles \u00a345), which opened last year, a stylish, friendly boutique hotel with roof gardens in trendy San Telmo. 2. Seattle (100th) When the dot.com bubble burst at the turn of the century, Seattle&apos;s cool new bars, shops and restaurants that opened in the 90s got a whole lot cheaper - boom time for visitors. The arty Ace Hotel (acehotel.com) described by Time Magazine as a &quot;super-aesthetic barrack&quot; is great value, with rooms from $100.  3. Vilnius (97th)  The baroque old town rivals Tallinn&apos;s but there are less stags and hens. Most east European cities are a bargain, but few are as beautiful and intriguing as Vilnius. Stay at the charming Grybas House (shakespeare.lt, \u20ac110) tucked away in a quiet courtyard in the old town. 4. Bangkok (95th) Bangkok is propelling itself from the third world into the first, so you can still shop, bomb around in tuk-tuks and eat some of the best street food in the world for peanuts but also afford to hang out in clubs and bars and stay in hotels like the Triple Two Silom (tripletwosilom.com, around \u00a370) that are straight out of Wallpaper*.  5. Lisbon (73rd) A taxi from the airport into western Europe&apos;s cheapest capital costs around the same as a tube ride from Heathrow into London, and drinking and eating (some of the best seafood in Europe) is also a fraction of the price.

This compelling account of climate change is inspired by the holistic worldview of Australia&apos;s Aborigines and James Lovelock&apos;s Gaia theory, and it provides an excellent summary of the state we&apos;re in: the science and history of the planet&apos;s climate, suggestions for reducing your personal carbon footprint, as well as the prognosis for our overheating planet (it&apos;s not good). Flannery reveals some frightening facts about our carbon addiction: &quot;half of the energy generated since the industrial revolution has been consumed in just the last 20 years&quot;. And every year the minute mineral particles produced by burning coal kill nearly 60,000 people in the US alone. But he admits that curing our carbon habit will cost trillions of dollars. A role for nuclear power is not ruled out, but he favours a future in which wind and solar energy allow people to generate their own power, as he does himself. Flannery describes becoming self-sufficient in energy as &quot;one of the most satisfying things I&apos;ve ever done&quot;. Australia could learn a lot from his example: it has yet to sign the Kyoto Protocol. PD Smith  Surely You&apos;re Joking, Mr Feynman!, by Richard P Feynman (Vintage, \u00a38.99) For his work on quantum electrodynamics, Feynman shared the 1965 Nobel prize for physics. But throw away all your preconceptions about scientists when you read this book: Feynman loved practical jokes, playing the bongos, cracking safes and visiting topless bars, where (he claimed) he used to &quot;work a little physics on the paper placemats with the scalloped edges&quot;. He could be irascible, opinionated, even rude; but he was always brilliant. He accused artists of not knowing &quot;anything about the beauty of the real world - the scientific world&quot;. Then he took drawing classes to show them how it should be done and was soon selling his art. This classic memoir, first published in 1985 and now reissued, is based on a series of taped interviews with a friend. It reveals a uniquely inventive and inquiring mind. Even as a boy of 12 he was always looking for new ways of doing the most mundane things. His ingenuity took him from the Heath-Robinson gadgets he invented as a youngster to the ultimate 20th-century gadget: the atomic bomb. A great read and a wonderful insight into the life of physics. PDS Global Outlaws: Crime, Money and Power in the Contemporary World, by Carolyn Nordstrom (University of California Press, \u00a313.95) Anthropologist Carolyn Nordstrom is here to tell us that there&apos;s more to illegal trade than a guy selling dodgy DVDs down the pub, photogenic white girls trafficking heroin through Bangkok, and The Sopranos. Her report from the frontlines and backyards of the &quot;extra-legal&quot; explores both how it works and its broader relationship to how we organise ourselves as a world. It&apos;s a poetic and hardnosed intellectual travelogue, starting on a dusty street in Angola with a child selling Marlboros and ending with human traffic in China. Nordstrom interviews numerous security officials, meets narcotic folk hero Howard Marks, and discovers just how easy it is to buy her own bank. Global Outlaws troubles conventional wisdom by suggesting that in this world of raw resources, hot dollars and cool goods, illegal products can sometimes be better than legal ones, and that the most significant crime lies in the &quot;structural violence of inequality embedded in our institutions&quot;. For, as illegal trade both saturates and is symptomatic of a broader economic system, &quot;these exceptions aren&apos;t the exception to the rule of the economy. They are the economy&quot;. Jo Littler  Having It So Good: Britain in the Fifties, by Peter Hennessy (Penguin, \u00a39.99) This history of 1950s Britain opens with Peter Hennessy describing a contemporaneous film about Blackpool called Holiday. All beach, beauty pageants and swimming pools, the film gets so close &quot;you can almost smell the chlorine&quot;. He uses such everyday colour and sensory memory to supplement his top-down history of the intricate workings of governments during the decade. He says he is &quot;uneasy with high politics absorbed neat&quot;, so added to the details of the Suez crisis and rows between Churchill and Eden are his memories of Babycham bottles and Perry Como singing Magic Moments. Hennessy is a well-regarded left-liberal historian and, in this second part of his history of post-1945 Britain, he argues that in the early postwar years there was a high level of political consensus around left-liberal ideas - for &quot;Britain&apos;s New Deal&quot; - which was later eroded. And although, even with its addition of &quot;everyday memory&quot;, the book ends up emphasising the powerful white men he primarily examines, it also provides an important and useful analysis of what they were up to. JL Crete, by Barry Unsworth (National Geographic, \u00a36.99) What a surprisingly old-fashioned book. Unsworth went on a long Cretan holiday with his wife (so formally and uxoriously referred to throughout that I imagined her in a 50s-style cardie); eating mezze and noting their ingredients as if unaccustomed to them; filing through the Samaria gorge amid a hustle of tourists; using the worn tropes of the travel piece - &quot;old quarter&quot;, &quot;excellent restaurant&quot;, &quot;impeccably dinner-jacketed head waiter&quot;, &quot;one can wander at will&quot;. For a while I thought he might be attempting Greek-period Patrick Leigh Fermor (Mani, Roumeli), what with the summaries of Cretan history, myth and poems, but he lacks PLF&apos;s expansive brio. And while Unsworth&apos;s details are lovely (the jar of burnt peas excavated from the Minoan ruins, the spread and loft of the Samarian cypress trees), they&apos;re almost rationed - as if there had only been space for a few on the postcard. Poor man, touring the palace at Knossos in a state of horde-resentment and fulminating against those modern deluxe palaces, the mega-hotels. It&apos;s the way the world is, and all you can control is the way that you understand it.

I worked on the Daily Mirror&apos;s 3am gossip column, meeting everyone from George Clooney (who didn&apos;t disappoint in the flesh) and Brad Pitt (who did) to Kylie, Tom Cruise, David Beckham (very flirty) and Jude Law (who has a lollipop head on a scrawny little body). It felt like the best job in the world. I interviewed my showbiz heroes; blagged my way onto a James Bond set, only to have my cardigan ripped off me by Pierce Brosnan, who then rubbed my goose pimples to keep me warm; got drunk and took drugs with other stars; ran out of randy celebs&apos; hotel rooms; and gained access to some of the best parties and awards ceremonies around the world. But after five years, the excitement was starting to wear off. It was a miracle I hadn&apos;t ended up in rehab like so many of the stars I wrote about. You can&apos;t be a half-hearted gossip columnist. It&apos;s all or nothing.  I had always wanted to travel. My parents had banned me from taking a gap year after my A-levels in case I never came back. The more I thought about following my dream of backpacking around the world, the more I realised there was no going back. Two close friends who worked in showbiz, Sam and Sarah, were also fed up with the daily grind in London with nothing to show for it but overdrafts and bad dating stories. The timing was right for all of us.  In June 2005, after saving up for eight months, we booked round-the-world tickets through Trailfinders (we planned to go to India, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela) and a week later we all handed in our notice to our bosses. My colleagues were stunned by my decision. They couldn&apos;t understand why I&apos;d want to leave such a fabulous job to become a backpacker. They also pondered how I&apos;d exist without my hair straighteners. &apos;Go for it,&apos; said the editor, Richard Wallace, adding: &apos;I&apos;m going to put a bet on that you&apos;ll be found dead of an overdose in a ladyboy drug den in Bangkok in your first week!&apos;  My mother was appalled at my decision. &apos;But only kids go on gap years! You&apos;re 30. You can&apos;t carry a backpack around at your age. Get a suitcase on wheels at least,&apos; she instructed me. On 5 October 2005, Sarah, Sam and I flew to Delhi for the first stop on our grand adventure. Friends suggested chilling out on a beach for the first few weeks, but I didn&apos;t want to do that. I wanted to throw myself straight into the mayhem. Less than a week after I had left my job, life and flat in London, I was on a fisherman&apos;s boat at dawn, gliding along the Ganges in Varanasi, the holiest place to die in India. Funeral pyres with dead people&apos;s feet poking out crackled on the banks of the polluted river. All around us holy men were standing semi-naked in the brown water, performing early-morning religious rituals. Sitting in that boat, I couldn&apos;t believe that I used to get so wound up about hunting down Sienna Miller&apos;s latest boyfriend. I was happier than I had been in years.  Within days of arriving in India I sent a package home with half the contents of my backpack. I had no real need for a - wait for it - cashmere Juicy Couture tracksuit while backpacking. It was fantastically liberating not to wear make-up or high heels or use a hairdryer. After two years of being addicted to my hair straighteners, I quickly embraced the greasy-haired curly look. In India&apos;s steaming cities, I had no choice.  Living in such close proximity to my friends was something we had been worried about, but in the end it felt like one endless pyjama party. A friend back home, Niki, resigned from her job on another newspaper as she was envious of our email travelling updates and &apos;fed up with ruining people&apos;s lives&apos;. Luckily, as she&apos;s only 5ft 1, she didn&apos;t take up much room in the cramped camper van for our four-week road trip down the east coast of Australia. When we arrived in New Zealand I did wonder whether we&apos;d be the oldest guests in the hostels, but it wasn&apos;t the case. We spent three weeks there and met travellers of every age group, every background and every walk of life. In fact New Zealand and Australia were the scenes of some of our most teenage-like behaviour. I had an enormous tattoo of my family crest done on my bottom and Niki had her tongue pierced. She removed the bolt from her swollen tongue a few months later. I, alas, will have my nine-inch griffin for life. One of my main aims for the trip was to take part in activities that would scare me witless. I made sure I didn&apos;t inform my parents of my 15,000-foot skydive above Lake Taupo, New Zealand, until after the event. Flinging myself out of a plane, freefalling, forgetting to breathe in my excitement (and nearly blacking out as a result) but then landing safely on my feet, was the highlight of my adventure activities.  Trekking up the Franz Josef glacier in New Zealand, getting to grips with a trapeze in Byron Bay in Australia and horse-riding in the sea in Brazil and Venezuela remain some of my most cherished memories. And of course tumbling down the Death Slide in South America&apos;s largest waterpark was a high point. Top tip: don&apos;t wear a teeny-weeny Brazilian bikini on a waterslide. Crime and illness are two aspects that put a lot of people off travelling. I was incredibly lucky. Health-wise, the worst I experienced was a 12-hour vomiting bug in Mumbai. No one got mugged, attacked or even threatened. Sarah had her flip flops nicked on Ipanema beach when she went for a dip in the sea. But at \u00a34 a pair for Havaianas out there, she wasn&apos;t too grief-stricken. I quickly adapted to life on the road, living out of my backpack on a very tight budget. One of my favourite locations was a \u00a31-a-night beach hut with no electricity and a communal hole in the ground for a loo in Gokarna, India. I learnt that I was far tougher than I had given myself credit for. Flying insects and cockroaches? No problem. A friend didn&apos;t even flinch when she stumbled upon a rat chewing one of her bikinis in her hut. One major pitfall we hadn&apos;t anticipated was the opposite sex. A male friend joined us for three weeks in New Zealand. I had a brief fling with him but after we called it off, it quickly became apparent that he&apos;d taken a fancy to Sarah. For weeks we all pretended nothing was happening and when it did come out in the open, it was awkward and a bit humiliating. When you&apos;re on the road with friends, there really is no escape from each other. You will experience the best of them and the worst. The secret is to constantly communicate your feelings with one another. Bottling up feelings of resentment over petty rows can blow up into huge fights if you&apos;re not careful. By the end of the seventh month away, we decided it was time to go home. Money was running low and there is only so long you can laze around on a beach in Venezuela.  There&apos;s something alluring about suspending reality while away. When you&apos;re on a two-week holiday, worries about life back home ebb away. After seven months on the road, I no longer knew what my reality was back in the UK. But I was adamant I couldn&apos;t return to my previous incarnation as a gossip columnist. It would have felt like a step backwards. Travelling gave me a sense of freedom I&apos;d never experienced before. The biggest day-to-day decision was what to eat and drink and when to move on to the next place. I couldn&apos;t envisage myself working in an office again. I had learnt that there was more to life than climbing the career ladder and I wanted to cling onto that lesson. Despite my worries about settling back into life in London, it took me four months to get back into the swing of things. I discovered life had remained the same back home. But I had changed. Going travelling gave me the confidence to achieve another ambition. I wrote a book last summer about my adventures as a gossip columnist and am now working on my next one. And I&apos;ve managed to squeeze in four trips abroad this year... so far.

It&apos;s really quite simple: a few turns and then down the highway. But a week ago, as I sought to catch a plane to London, I wound up making all the wrong turns. I had what I deemed to be a legitimate excuse. My new wife and I had returned from our honeymoon a day earlier, flying from Bangkok to Tokyo to Los Angeles to our home in America&apos;s capital. After travelling for more than 24 hours, I was barely able to stand straight, see clearly or think coherently. But as I boarded the plane, there was one thing of which I was certain, even in my jetlagged state: my trip to Britain would be thoroughly uneventful. I was flying over to attend the award dinner for the \u00a330,000 Samuel Johnson Prize for non-fiction. Though my book, Imperial Life in the Emerald City, was on the shortlist, I had convinced myself I wasn&apos;t going to win, so much so that I told my lovely wife, Julie, to rest at home. I didn&apos;t even bother to prepare an acceptance speech, even though the event was to be televised. There was no way, I thought, I&apos;d rise to the top of such a strong shortlist. An American, James Shapiro, had won it last year. The judges wouldn&apos;t possibly award it to two Yanks in a row. Oh, and there was the kiss of death: William Hill had given me the best odds. Anyway, I had been happy enough simply to have my book published in the United Kingdom. The awards dinner, at the Savoy Hotel, featured a sumptuous meal and a room full of people I didn&apos;t know. I&apos;m told some of the most influential people in London&apos;s publishing scene were in attendance. I coped by drinking. Champagne. Sancerre. Bordeaux. No harm in getting a bit buzzed. After all, I wasn&apos;t going to win. After Helena Kennedy, the chair of the five judges, compared my book with John Hersey&apos;s writing on Hiroshima and Truman Capote&apos;s In Cold Blood, I was even more convinced that I wasn&apos;t going to win. It&apos;s the sort of stuff judges say to be polite to the runner-up. When Kennedy announced that I had won, my mouth went dry. But as I walked up to the stage, I had no worries about not preparing remarks. I knew what I wanted to say: I would pay tribute to all of the brave Iraqi journalists who have worked with me, and with other Western journalists, often at great personal risk, so that we can tell the world what is occurring there. As soon as she heard the news, Julie packed a suitcase and headed to the airport. She caught the last BA flight from Washington to Heathrow while I was still swilling champagne in the American Bar at the Savoy. The day after the big night was devoted to helping fresh-off-the-plane Julie, a fellow journalist, find a pair of shoes to wear that night to a party for us in Hampstead graciously hosted by Kevin Sullivan and Mary Jordan, the husband-and-wife team who run the Washington Post&apos;s bureau in London. Kevin and Mary had their priorities straight. They wanted to know about the wedding before any discussion of the prize. We recounted how our rabbi read his script off a palm computer, how our Hindu priest screwed up the names of our relatives and how the wedding planner had told the hotel staff to slice our cake before we had even had a chance to make our own incision and feed a piece to each other. It&apos;s funny how things that once made you so mad become fodder for laughs just a few weeks later. It was at the party that I ran into the Guardian&apos;s Ghaith Abdul-Ahad, one of Iraq&apos;s most talented journalists. I hadn&apos;t seen him since 2004. We embraced and quickly began an animated discussion about his recent trip to Basra, the troop &apos;surge&apos; and how the Iraq problem is playing out in Washington. We wound up agreeing on most points - that the surge wasn&apos;t going to fix things, that support among Iraqis for Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was waning and that Iraq faces many more dark months and years ahead. With sectarian violence raging out of control, I suggested that a partition of the country deserves a more serious examination. Ghaith argued that formalising a division between Sunnis and Shias could spark even more bloodshed. We hadn&apos;t solved Iraq&apos;s problems, but it reminded me how important it is for all of us to listen to the perspective of smart Iraqis like Ghaith. Back in the United States. As I strolled to work at the Post on Friday morning, fiddling with my new wedding band, Washington felt the same as it ever was - warm and muggy. A new crop of young summer interns had flooded the city. Gone was the euphoria of the Samuel Johnson. My thoughts turned to the prosaic: the wedding-gift thank-you notes Julie and I needed to write, the renovations to our flat, the dinner we would cook for my parents at the weekend, the weeding of our flower pots. When I got to the office, I wondered whether I, too, am now ensconced in my own green zone, walled off from the grim reality of our day, worried more about bookshelves instead of bombs. It&apos;s wonderful to be married, to be back home in America, but I don&apos;t want to become inured to or, even worse, ignorant of what&apos;s happening outside my cocoon.

The ban was imposed following a series of accidents involving the country&apos;s aircraft that have included two fatal crashes since the New Year which killed a total of 123 people. The national airline of Indonesia, Garuda, and the 50 other airlines registered in the country, will be kept away from the EU, although no Indonesian carriers at present fly to the continent. Hours after the ban was announced Angolan national radio reported that a Boeing 737 operated by one of the newly banned carriers, TAAG Angola Airlines, had crashed in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Jacques Barrot, the EU transport commissioner, said: &quot;Once more, the EU blacklist will prove to be an essential tool not only to prevent unsafe airlines from flying to Europe and to inform passengers travelling worldwide, but also to make sure that airlines and civil aviation authorities take appropriate actions to improve safety.&quot; The ban could affect the Indonesian tourist industry, with Europeans being warned not to use the country&apos;s airlines. Travel agencies selling package tours involving carriers based in Indonesia are required to inform customers that the nation&apos;s airlines are blacklisted. Holidaymakers who have booked flights with blacklisted carriers through tourist agents will receive a refund. EU officials said poor maintenance and operating standards, as well as the slow reaction of Indonesian aviation authorities to demands for better standards, had contributed to the ban. The Indonesian airline market was deregulated in the 1990s and its safety record has been chequered ever since, with fatalities on some flights. Scores of low-cost airlines have been established. David Learmount, operations and safety editor at Flight International, said Indonesia was one of the few examples where deregulation of the airline market had lowered safety standards rather than raised them: &quot;Standards in aviation safety have been going up dramatically on a worldwide basis, but there are still places where they are [of the standards of] the 70s and 80s. In Indonesia the safety watchdog was told earlier this year to pull its socks up, but the EU is clearly convinced that it has not done so.&quot; An EU official, referring to the national regulator&apos;s failure to heed warnings that a ban was imminent and that reassurances were needed, said the Indonesian civil aviation authority was &quot;not very reliable&quot;. Indonesian officials claimed that, despite the recent crashes, airline safety was improving, according to data not seen by the European commission. US authorities have also warned the Indonesian aviation regulator this year, leading to the US federal aviation authority downgrading Indonesia&apos;s rating. The EU added that TAAG Angola Airlines and Ukraine&apos;s Volare Aviation would be added to the no-fly list. Following consultation with the EU, Russia has also banned four of its airlines and placed restrictions on six others. Bulgaria has also grounded six cargo carriers, while Moldova has banned eight carriers. One of the companies most recently affected by a flight embargo, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), had its ban partly lifted yesterday. The airline will be allowed to fly certain Boeing 747 and Airbus 310 planes, while its entire fleet of Boeing 777s remains free to travel. The latest banned list will come into force at the end of next week. African airlines have been the worst affected by the EU clampdown on what Mr Barrot calls &quot;flying coffins&quot;. All airlines flying from Equatorial Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Swaziland, have been banned from the continent since last year, plus all but one of the 51 airlines operating out of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Other blacklisted carriers include the state carrier of North Korea, Air Koryo, and Reem Air of Kyrgyzstan. Alongside PIA, the most high-profile airline affected by the stringent EU standards is Thailand&apos;s Phuket Airlines, a carrier that flew thousands of British tourists to Bangkok but failed safety tests last year. Yesterday&apos;s announcement brings the total number of airlines banned by the EU to about 150. Indonesia racks up fatality rate of 15 times world average Flying in Indonesia can be a worry. The number of airlines, since deregulation of the sector in the 1990s, has reached a total of 51, and there has been a sharp rise in deadly incidents: the fatality rate is now 15 times the world average. Ticket prices may have been driven down by brutal competition to as little as $10, but the drawbacks are obvious. Indonesia&apos;s air safety record is among the world&apos;s worst. Travellers&apos; blogs warn of ageing aircraft showing much wear and tear, and of sloppy maintenance. Poor runways, patchy radar, lack of experienced maintenance staff and the need to hire pilots from all quarters, have exacerbated the problems. One blogger, responding to yesterday&apos;s move by the EU to ban Indonesian airlines from flying to Europe, highlighted some of the problems - from pilots moonlighting for smaller airlines, to aircraft in the air and more than 20 years old. &quot;I think Wings Airways has the best motto, painted in big letters on their planes, &apos;Fly is Cheap&apos;,&quot; the blogger wrote. Another recalled the equally unsettling motto of Lion Air: &quot;We make people fly.&quot; Hair-raising tales of hard landings and kangarooing aircraft are legion. One flier reported a pilot trying to land in a paddy field before pulling out of the descent at the last minute and aligning to the runway. In the past two years, 280 people have died in disasters that analysts attribute to infrastructure failing to keep pace with new services. The mix has produced a string of mishaps this year already. On New Year&apos;s day, an Adam Air budget flight disappeared from radar off Sulawesi and 102 people died. Another plane of the same airline had a &quot;hard landing&quot; and broke its &quot;back&quot;, though no one was injured. In March, a Garuda flight from Jakarta to Yogyakarta crashed and caught fire on landing, killing 21. The same month Indonesia&apos;s transport ministry ruled that none of its airlines met international safety standards. The seven airlines that ranked lowest, including Adam Air with its fleet on average 18 years old, were given three months to smarten up their act. Yet just ahead of yesterday&apos;s EU decision the government cleared all but one airline, which lost its licence. Only Garuda was put in the top tier; the others were placed in the second category considered necessary to meet minimal international safety standards.", "publicationDate": "2007-06-29T06:53:41Z", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Travel", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jun/29/theairlineindustry.travel", "title": "EU bans 'unsafe' airlines from flights to the continent", "sentences": ["Alongside PIA, the most high-profile airline affected by the stringent EU standards is Thailand&apos;s Phuket Airlines, a carrier that flew thousands of British tourists to Bangkok but failed safety tests last year."]}, {"article": "Steve McClaren and his predecessors may have their own particular complaints and challenges when it comes to managing the England national team. But a few weeks of work experience with Jorvan Vieira, the new coach of Iraq&apos;s national team, would make them count their blessings. Vieira, a 53-year-old Brazilian, was appointed a month ago, charged with leading the team in the Asian Cup, which kicks off in Bangkok in a week&apos;s time. &quot;You cannot imagine it,&quot; Vieira said after a team dinner at a restaurant in Amman, Jordan. &quot;I am in a real Arabic souk. Every day, I don&apos;t know where we will go for training. Every day, people want to meet with me for two or three hours a day to discuss the players. Today, I kicked a chair. I kicked everything.&quot; Like many coaches of developing countries&apos; national teams, Vieira has a long and winding CV. He has extensive experience with Arab clubs and national teams - he was assistant coach with Morocco at the 1986 World Cup - but nothing quite prepared him for taking charge of a team with no home, representing a broken country. For economic reasons, as well as personal safety, and because organised football in Iraq was destroyed by the war, most of his squad play with clubs across the Middle East and Cyprus. Vieira&apos;s family remained in Morocco while he prepared his team during June at the Iraq Football Association&apos;s makeshift base in Jordan - effectively an Amman hotel lobby. &quot;Some of them, if they go to Iraq, they are going to be killed,&quot; Vieira said of his squad. &quot;When you don&apos;t know where your home is, where your things are, you are lost in space. It&apos;s the same when you have no organisation in your house. You don&apos;t know where you put your socks or your trousers. It&apos;s the same here. They are lost people because of the war.&quot; Carrying an Iraqi passport, even if you play for the national team, can lead to situations many professional footballers may struggle to comprehend. &quot;When some players arrived here in Amman they had to wait six or seven hours at the airport,&quot; Vieira explained. &quot;The Jordanian police would not allow them to come into the country. Nobody did anything, nobody moved, nobody wrote a list of players to tell the government that this is the Iraq national team. The players suffered only because they had Iraqi passports.&quot; Despite their trials, Vieira said, his players have not allowed their country&apos;s troubles to affect the unity of the squad. &quot;I don&apos;t have one person in this group who hasn&apos;t lost someone from their family because of this war. But they never mix politics in the team. They never talk about it. They regret the situation, of course, and they are nostalgic. They miss their country and they&apos;re not happy to see their country like it is but nobody talks about the war. &quot;I have different groups, different sects, like in Iraq, but here nothing happens and everything is OK. I have Sunni and I have Shia and there is no problem. They are very close. I have experience with a lot of Arabic countries and I&apos;ve already learned a lot since I&apos;ve been with the Iraq team. This is a typical religious war. The extremists have tried to put more fire in the situation. Iraqi people who used to live in peace before, and had respect for religious differences, are now under oppression. &quot;My assistant coach was living in Baghdad but one day he was driving his car and he was stopped. They stole his car and said, &apos;If you don&apos;t go, we will kill you.&apos; Then they began calling him and said that if he didn&apos;t give money then they were going to kidnap his son. He had to leave Baghdad. The city is being run by gangsters, like in Brazil. Rio de Janeiro and Baghdad are like twin brothers when it comes to violence. It&apos;s crazy.&quot; Against this backdrop Vieira seeks success in the Asian Cup. Japan - the holders - South Korea, China and Saudi Arabia are the heavyweights alongside the favourites, and the Asian Football Confederation newcomers, Australia. Iraq will meet the Socceroos on July 13 in a group that also includes Thailand and Oman. The team&apos;s core is built around the side that impressed at the 2004 Athens Olympics when Iraq beat Portugal, Costa Rica, and Australia before losing out on a bronze medal to Italy. Vieira needs to have similar aspirations for the Asian Cup. &quot;I want to be in the last four,&quot; he said. &quot;If I had more time, I would tell you I&apos;m going to make the final but now that&apos;s not possible. If we got to the final then, as the Arabs say, &apos;it is with God&apos;.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-06-29T23:17:59Z", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jun/30/newsstory.sport2", "title": "Matthew Hall meets a team in exile", "sentences": ["Vieira, a 53-year-old Brazilian, was appointed a month ago, charged with leading the team in the Asian Cup, which kicks off in Bangkok in a week&apos;s time."]}, {"article": "Now and then I like watching those obscure African godly channels in the nether regions of Sky&apos;s EPG.

Big Brother was supposed to be a social experiment, damn it. Not a 10-week audition for a gig on Channel X reverberting your arse-cheeks quickly to Akon.

Charley, whose default setting is disgruntled Bangkok jail ladyboy who has recently been informed today&apos;s crack isn&apos;t arriving, is a worry for me. How will she stay famous? She&apos;s volatile, destructive and highly fragile. I hope she doesn&apos;t go the same way as BB1 bald supergob Nichola Holt. Saying that, Nichola didn&apos;t look too glum in the last photos I saw of her. Neither did the two blokes with mullets who were either end making her into a sort of airtight vaccuum.

Destined to spend life on a pile of fluffy mattresses claiming she can still feel the pea. Good for her. More worrying is Brian, the man with the hairstyle which is the direct middle ground between an &quot;Afro&quot; and &quot;Flock Of Seagulls&quot; bouffant. Brian has given up a steady job at a credit card firm for this once-in-a-lifetime chance.

Since Thaksin signalled his interest in making a \u00a321.6m bid to buy the club just weeks ago, the military government which overthrew him in a bloodless coup last September has accused him of five counts of abusing his power to advance his financial interests and has frozen \u00a3900m in his and his family&apos;s bank accounts. A fortnight ago Thai government prosecutors filed criminal corruption charges against Thaksin and his wife, Potjaman, over the sale of land in Bangkok to her while he was prime minister. The couple have also been charged by the country&apos;s Department of Special Investigation with concealing their assets and ordered to return to the country, which they have so far declined to do. Last week their son and daughter, Phantongtae and Pinthongta, both lined up to become directors at City, received a \u00a3165m tax bill which the authorities claim is outstanding from the sale of the family business, Shin Corp, in 2005. City have pressed on regardless with selling the club to the Shinawatras, saying the charges are invalid because they are being brought by a military government. However, it is not certain that the club itself, or the money Thaksin is using to buy it, will remain out of reach of these proceedings. The Thai finance minister, Chalongphob Sussangkarn, said recently that the authorities may investigate Thaksin&apos;s funds here, suggesting they may not have been declared as required when he was prime minister. The club and its advisors have been comforted by the fact that the Thai government is not recognised in the UK but that does not mean criminal proceedings will necessarily be deemed invalid here. The extradition treaty between the UK and Thailand remains in force and, if the Thai authorities press to have Thaksin returned, according to a Home Office spokesman, any application from Thailand will be decided &quot;on its individual merits&quot;. City declined to say this week why they are confident they will not be affected but Thaksin&apos;s financial representative here, Seymour Pierce, has said that enough of his money is lodged here already and was transferred &quot;legitimately&quot;. One source close to the deal said City had satisfied themselves Thaksin has enough money outside Thailand to complete the \u00a321.6m purchase of the club and repay \u00a317.5m of the loans owing to the major shareholders, John Wardle and David Makin. Beyond that, though, he said: &quot;We cannot guarantee what will happen in the future.&quot; It is not clear how much money Thaksin has to spend on City. The source said there is an understanding Thaksin will need to borrow and transfer some assets if he is to deliver on the splendidly optimistic promise in his offer document, sent to City shareholders last week, that his investment will &quot;in time enable the club to qualify for European competition on a regular basis&quot;. Although his bank accounts have been frozen in Thailand, the offer document reveals that the takeover of City is to be financed, and the club ultimately owned, by the Pramaisuri Property Company, a Shinawatra company based in Bangkok. A holding company, owned substantially by Pramaisuri, has loaned \u00a340.6m to the company Thaksin has formed here, UK Sports Investments Limited, to take over City. In the offer document Thaksin acknowledges the actions against him, saying a &quot;freezing order against bank accounts and assets in Thailand&quot; has been brought by the government &quot;in relation to alleged conflicts of interest, corruption and related offences&quot;. The document asserts Thaksin&apos;s innocence. &quot;All the allegations made by the Assets Examination Committee and other Thai prosecutory authorities are entirely refuted,&quot; it says, adding that Thaksin &quot;will be vigorously defending all such allegations.&quot; Thaksin has also issued a statement scorning the AEC&apos;s authority, saying it aims &quot;to tear down Thaksin&apos;s reputation and rights in Thailand at any costs and by whatsoever means&quot; and adding that Thaksin had laid criminal charges against members of the AEC for alleged libel and abuse of power. Dr Jason Abbot, a fellow in South East Asian Politics at London&apos;s School of Oriental and African Studies, explains that Thaksin&apos;s tenure as prime minister was &quot;always clouded by allegations of corruption&quot; as well as of human rights abuses in the 2003 &quot;war on drugs&quot; and when putting down an insurgency by Malay Muslims in the south. Thaksin, though, denied the allegations and remained popular, winning elections, particularly because he delivered more affordable health care to Thailand&apos;s rural poor. The country&apos;s elite and middle classes were more hostile to Thaksin&apos;s methods. The \u00a3900m sale of Shin Corp to the Singaporean company Temasek was the final straw, bringing mass demonstrations to the Bangkok streets followed by the military coup, which was backed by the Thai king. Abbot believes City have been &quot;naive&quot; to enter a deal with Thaksin. &quot;They seem to have assumed this is a minor financial affair in a foreign country of little concern to the club or the club&apos;s fans and image. In fact it concerns major questions about one of the world&apos;s most dynamic developing countries.&quot; City argue they have not been naive and have carried out all necessary legal checks that Thaksin is good for the money. The offer document reveals further reasons why City were desperately keen to find a buyer who would invest, describing a significant worsening in the club&apos;s financial position over the past year. Although no figures are included, the document notes that City&apos;s attendances fell last season, as did TV income, while players&apos; wages rose &quot;in order to mitigate the risk of relegation&quot;. There has also been a &quot;slower take-up&quot; of season tickets by disillusioned fans. Most starkly last December City borrowed \u00a310m, which they spent, against TV income due to be paid for the 2007-08 season. The Premier League is due to make next season&apos;s first payment, of \u00a313.5m, to all 20 clubs on August 6. City must immediately pay \u00a310m of that to the Standard Bank, which lent them the money last season. That \u00a310m was taken on in addition to the \u00a340m long-term debt City are carrying and \u00a319.1m owed to Wardle and Makin. The pair will receive \u00a317.5m for those loans from Thaksin if the deal goes ahead as planned. City&apos;s financial situation, then, looks grim, with falling crowds, increasing debts and a big chunk of next season&apos;s TV money already spent. Hence the eagerness to sell the club to Shinawatra because, despite the corruption proceedings, frozen bank accounts and all the other questions, he is promising money to spirit City to a better future. david.conn@theguardian.com", "publicationDate": "2007-07-03T23:35:51Z", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Manchester City"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jul/04/newsstory.manchestercity", "title": "Thaksin closes in on City as trouble mounts at home", "sentences": ["A fortnight ago Thai government prosecutors filed criminal corruption charges against Thaksin and his wife, Potjaman, over the sale of land in Bangkok to her while he was prime minister.", "Although his bank accounts have been frozen in Thailand, the offer document reveals that the takeover of City is to be financed, and the club ultimately owned, by the Pramaisuri Property Company, a Shinawatra company based in Bangkok.", "The \u00a3900m sale of Shin Corp to the Singaporean company Temasek was the final straw, bringing mass demonstrations to the Bangkok streets followed by the military coup, which was backed by the Thai king."]}, {"article": "Taking offence seems to be turning in to a full-time occupation in Iran. Just days after being gravely offended by the awarding of a knighthood to Salman Rushdie (an author who, ironically, was honoured by the Iranian literary establishment for his novel, Shame) the mullahs of Tehran have got themselves in a tizzy over the French-produced film version of Marjane Satrapi&apos;s autobiographical graphic novel Persepolis. The Iranian embassy in Thailand has successfully lobbied to have the French animated film withdrawn from the Bangkok International Film Festival. The director of the festival, Chattan Kunjara na Ayudhya told Reuters, with wonderful diplomacy:  &quot;I was invited by the Iranian embassy to discuss the matter and we both came to mutual agreement that it would be beneficial to both countries if the film was not shown. It&apos;s a good film, but there are other considerations.&quot;  The last sentence seems a touch odd coming from the director of a film festival. What could these &quot;other considerations&quot; possibly be, eh? Here is President Ahmadinejad&apos;s media adviser Mehdi Halhor, speaking after the film&apos;s showing at Cannes to help you out:  &quot;Producing and highlighting the anti-Iranian film Persepolis in Cannes falls in line with Islamophobia.&quot;  You could kinda see that coming, couldn&apos;t you? Anyone who&apos;s read the Persepolis books will know what nonsense this is. The monochrome graphic novels are practically a love song to Iran, and don&apos;t actually dwell that much on religion at all. What do you say to that, Mehdi?  &quot;[Persepolis presents] an unrealistic picture of the achievements and results of the glorious Islamic revolution.&quot;  So we&apos;re getting a little closer to the truth: the charge of &quot;Islamophobia&quot; is dishonest and disingenuous: what you&apos;re really about is trying to silence a voice that questions the line of the &quot;glorious revolution&quot;. And I&apos;ll admit you&apos;ve got a point here: Persepolis does highlight the dark absurdities of the time: from the obsessive prurience of the religious police, to the tragedy of the child-Basiji, sent to clear minefields with plastic keys to paradise hanging from their necks. But I think that Tehran has missed a trick here. While Satrapi is certainly no fan of the current regime, a huge part of Persepolis (at least the books) is dedicated to the wickedness of the reign of the Peacock Throne, and, later, the vacuous posturing of the western intelligentsia Marjane meets when she moves to Paris. Marjane emerges an interesting, independent, proud Iranian. Rather than attempt to stifle the film elsewhere, the Iranian government should actively promote Persepolis in their own country; it is an honest, thoughtful, beautiful work, which, far from being &quot;anti-Iranian&quot;, could actually bolster confidence and self-belief among Iran&apos;s millions of young people. But then, that may well be the last thing the regime wants.", "publicationDate": "2007-07-04T19:00:00Z", "tags": ["Iran", "Books", "Film", "Art", "Comics and graphic novels", "Middle East and North Africa", "Culture", "Art and design", "Marjane Satrapi"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/04/cartoonvillians", "title": "Cartoon villains", "sentences": ["The Iranian embassy in Thailand has successfully lobbied to have the French animated film withdrawn from the Bangkok International Film Festival."]}, {"article": "Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia 2007 may not trip as smoothly off the tongue, or go as smoothly on the ground, as Germany 2006 but at least this Asian Cup is going to get noticed. Most attention during the previous finals in 2004 centred on the fact that eventual champions Japan were booed everywhere they went in China, a journey that culminated in a bad-tempered final win over the hosts in Beijing. Pre-tournament publicity is better and three years on, Manchester United provided it by controversially arranging an exhibition game in Malaysia only two days after Kuala Lumpur was due to stage one of the semi-finals. The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) called the club &quot;disrespectful&quot;, forcing United to gracelessly accept the game&apos;s cancellation. As well as the distraction of the English champions; Thailand&apos;s military coup and dodgy stadia have also given the governing body headaches. Four hosts mean four times the complications. &quot;You get something from one government, but not another,&quot; admitted AFC chief Mohamed bin Hammam. The problems, though, will all be forgotten when the Thais kick off against Iraq in Bangkok tomorrow. The capital hosts four of the 16 participants. Groups B, C and D are based in Hanoi, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta, respectively. Australia are in Group A in their first foray into the competition. Too big for Oceania, the Aussies joined the AFC in 2006 and are considered favourites even without Guus Hiddink at the helm. At least that&apos;s what Lucas Neill thinks. &quot;I expect us to go through and be undefeated,&quot; said the West Ham defender in May. He could have a point. In Mark Viduka and the fit-again Merseyside pair of Tim Cahill and Harry Kewell, the Socceroos carry a real goal threat, something lacking in their rivals. Japan are certainly among them as they go for a third consecutive win. On the way, the Blue Samurai would also like revenge for the heartbreaking 3-1 defeat inflicted by Australia at last year&apos;s World Cup. The two could meet in the quarter-finals in either Bangkok or Hanoi, though both coaches would prefer the final in Jakarta on July 29. Much has changed in Japan since that defeat. The laid-back Zico has been replaced by bristly Bosnian Ivica Osim. Yugoslavia&apos;s 1990 World Cup coach has reversed the Brazilian&apos;s policy of giving European-based players free rein. Only two non J-League stars are in the squad and retired talisman Hidetoshi Nakata will be missed. They still have Shunsuke Nakamura, though the Celtic star may be surrounded by burnt out team-mates. The J-League finishes exactly a week before the competition starts. &quot;We&apos;ll be going to Vietnam with next to no preparation and with a squad of tired players. It&apos;s a novel approach,&quot; said Osim recently. It gets better for the Aussies. Most of South Korea&apos;s overseas stars are on crutches. Park Ji-sung, Lee Young-pyo and Seol Ki-hyeon were expected to spearhead the Taeguk Warriors&apos; campaign but all fell victim to the strains of the Premier League. Iran always pose a threat, sometimes to other teams, sometimes to each other. Despite players like Ali Karimi, Mehdi Mahdavikia and Bolton&apos;s Andranik Teymourian, the 2006 World Cup was truly dreadful for Team Melli with reports of infighting and disunity in the squad. The problems did not quite reach the levels of 2004 Asian Cup, however, when Rahman Rezaei and his defensive partner Ali Badavi could be seen exchanging slaps after an Oman goal. Saudi Arabia make up the traditional quartet of Asian powerhouses. The Saudis have not impressed on the global stage since they reached the second round of the World Cup in 1994. The stars from 13 years ago have finally retired and this month&apos;s competition could be too soon for the younger generation. The four co-hosts are probably the weakest teams in the tournament. Thailand are perhaps the best bet to reach the last eight but Vietnam&apos;s coach Alfred Riedl wants success to repay the fans, one of whom donated a kidney for the Austrian&apos;s transplant in March. South-east Asian football may not be what it once was but standards in the Gulf are rising. The region abounds with dark horses. Qatar, UAE, Iraq, Oman and Bahrain all have the potential to reach the last four. China also have a chance but the team has struggled since losing out to Japan in 2004. Uzbekistan carry the flag for central Asia but it is doubtful it will be flying in the latter stages, especially without the retired Mirdjalal &quot;Beckham&quot; Kasimov. With a decimated South Korea, an exhausted Japan, an uncertain Iran and an inexperienced Saudi Arabia, Lucas Neill&apos;s prediction may well be accurate.", "publicationDate": "2007-07-06T09:53:41Z", "tags": ["European club football", "Football", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jul/06/europeanfootball.sport", "title": "Australia are favourites for football's Asian Cup as defending champions Japan struggle", "sentences": ["The problems, though, will all be forgotten when the Thais kick off against Iraq in Bangkok tomorrow.", "The two could meet in the quarter-finals in either Bangkok or Hanoi, though both coaches would prefer the final in Jakarta on July 29."]}, {"article": "Final Call by Leo Hickman (400pp, Eden Project, \u00a312.99) Leo Hickman has had a good year. He&apos;s been clubbing in Ibiza, boozing in Tallinn, birdwatching in Costa Rica and staying in that enormous sail-shaped hotel in Dubai. But, as he&apos;s careful to point out, he hasn&apos;t been doing all this for fun: he&apos;s been investigating the tourism industry and the massive growth in worldwide travel. A Guardian columnist, Hickman has already written several books about ethical consumerism, describing his tortuous efforts to reconcile his conscience with the demands of work, family and ordinary urban life. In A Life Stripped Bare, he devoted a chapter to recounting how he and his family swapped long-haul travel for a walking tour in Tuscany, travelling across Europe by overnight train. In that book, Hickman&apos;s ecological musings are constantly interrupted by his wife, who punctures his ramblings and brings him down to earth. She doesn&apos;t make an appearance in The Final Call and I missed her brusque, honest and thoroughly sensible voice. So alone, Hickman jets around the world, pursuing British tourists and picking through the debris they leave behind. He follows sex tourists around Bangkok and describes how the dozy fishing village of Benidorm became a monstrous concrete city servicing four million holidaymakers a year. He visits the skiing centre in Dubai, where 6,000 tonnes of snow is kept frozen. But although making snow in the desert sounds ludicrous, Hickman discovers that the Alps aren&apos;t much different. Rising temperatures have removed much of the snow from the mountains, so water is pumped from reservoirs, frozen and sprayed on to the slopes. Italian thieves can apparently earn \u20ac900 for every truck of snow they steal from a glacier and deliver to a ski resort. Hickman discovers that tourists in some respects resemble armies: they strip the land of resources and leave a trail of destruction. Backpackers are the advance guard, package tours the footsoldiers. No one gives much thought to what happens to the landscape or its inhabitants when the army goes home. In Kerala, for instance, where a few hippies used to ride boats through the backwaters, so many people now take boat trips that the riverbeds are plastered with plastic bags and the fish taste of kerosene. In an excellent chapter on flying, Hickman dismisses a few myths and offers some useful ways to think about our own ecological footprint. &quot;Flying anywhere,&quot; we learn, &quot;emits broadly the same amount of emissions as if you drove there by car without taking any other passengers with you. Therefore, if you drive the UK average of 12,000 miles a year, you are creating the same amount of emissions as if you had made one London-Los Angeles return trip.&quot; He confesses that his book-related travels created 10 tonnes of CO2, mostly on flights, but dismisses carbon offsetting as little more than pointless. So, what&apos;s the answer? Hickman concludes with an idea taken from the food movement: Tourism Concern and the Fairtrade Labelling Organisation are working on a scheme awarding the Fairtrade label to hotels, resorts and travel agents that meet their stringent standards. If that doesn&apos;t appeal, then he suggests borrowing another culinary concept, from the slow food movement. Proponents of &quot;slow travel&quot; recommend we slow down and try to enjoy ourselves more, travelling by train, perhaps, staying in small hotels and lingering over meals, so that &quot;the journey itself becomes just as important as the destination&quot; and we &quot;relearn why it is we crave travel&quot;. It sounds like the recipe for a perfect holiday.", "publicationDate": "2007-07-07T22:36:09Z", "tags": ["Books", "Higher education", "Education", "Culture", "Travel writing"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jul/07/featuresreviews.guardianreview7", "title": "Final Call by Leo Hickman", "sentences": ["He follows sex tourists around Bangkok and describes how the dozy fishing village of Benidorm became a monstrous concrete city servicing four million holidaymakers a year."]}, {"article": "Bj\u00f6rk ambles around the chintzy suite of a west London hotel, smearing moisturiser into her face in an inexpert manner. She paws at her cheeks and her forehead, she rubs her upper eyelids aggressively, she drags at her skin. She&apos;s wearing a long, embroidered kaftan over metallic-silver leggings, a look she&apos;s accessorised with a long necklace, which seems to be made of discarded Barbie-doll limbs. A pair of cracked-silver Vivienne Westwood dolly shoes lie a little to one side; Bj\u00f6rk is barefoot. The overall effect is deranged - but cool, and not un-chic. She&apos;s tired, she says; her skin&apos;s tired, which is why she&apos;s slapping on the cream. She flew into the country from New York a day or so earlier. &apos;But I&apos;m good. I&apos;m OK,&apos; she says, in her peculiar accent, which is one-part comic cockney (&apos;innit!... What you call it? Speaking for meself...&apos;), one-part drawling American rhetoric (&apos;I got, what you call it? Creative control...&apos;), and one-part Icelandic (she says &apos;my dotter&apos; instead of &apos;my daughter&apos;, and rolls and rasps her Rs). Her excited inflections and unpredictable conversational segues make her sound like a 12-year-old boy. &apos;I been talking all day, so I&apos;m a bit fried. I will try to squeeze it out though, but I am a bit... you know... woo-hoo!&apos; she says. I laugh; she looks back at me, earnestly. I didn&apos;t expect Bj\u00f6rk to be eccentric in the flesh, although oddness is an integral part of her public persona, of course. Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s been making records for 30 years; she&apos;s been an internationally recognised artist for the last 21. Through all of that, her relentless eccentricity has been her celebrity shtick. Oddness, kookiness and quirkiness have been as much a part of Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s brand as her off-kilter, jarring, powerful sound. Bj\u00f6rk, who wore a swan costume up the red carpet at the Oscars in 2001. Bj\u00f6rk, who sewed pearls into her own skin for the video to 2001&apos;s &apos;Pagan Poetry&apos;. Bj\u00f6rk, who battered a television reporter at Don Muang airport in Bangkok, when she tried to talk to her son Sindri, then 10. Bj\u00f6rk, who was rumoured to have been so unhappy while filming a role in Lars von Trier&apos;s Dancer In The Dark that she ate her own cardigan. Bj\u00f6rk, who&apos;s just set Glastonbury 2007 on fire with her hugely theatrical extravaganza of a show, her outlandish headgear, her silver-sprayed forehead, her harpsichord and her crazy dancing. Still, I&apos;d assumed that Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s eccentricities had been exaggerated in press coverage somewhat; or that they were an act. Even if they&apos;d once been entirely genuine - she&apos;s now 41 years old, the mother of two children. Her boyfriend is Matthew Barney, leading light in New York&apos;s contemporary-art scene; they share a New York house once owned by No\u00ebl Coward. How eccentric can anyone with such adult credentials actually be? Well: very, apparently. In the flesh, Bj\u00f6rk is brilliantly odd. Her oddness is exacerbated by the accent, the styling, but also by her constant movement, her fidgety, twisty body, her gratuitous nose twitches. And then there&apos;s her logic. For example, she&apos;ll say, on the subject of her creative process: &apos;Music for me is like fact. Like algebra.&apos; And she&apos;ll expect you to understand what she means. But we&apos;re not getting on very well. We&apos;re having a bit of a row. She&apos;s objecting to one of my questions - which I thought was mild enough. I asked her at what point in her career she first felt famous; and she&apos;s reacted badly. Really badly. &apos;What a question!&apos; she says. She laughs, angrily. She looks at me. No one speaks. Then: &apos;That&apos;s a bit Hello! magazine, isn&apos;t it?&apos; Er, is it? &apos;Yeah,&apos; she says. She is very frosty indeed. We started off OK. I asked her if she wanted to talk to me about feminism, because there&apos;s some evidence of a feminist awakening in the lyrics of her latest album, Volta; and also because her press officer told me that she would. She laughed and said: &apos;That didn&apos;t come from me! I never had a press officer before, but I like it, actually! And I&apos;m sure he&apos;s right. I probably should talk about feminism...&apos; She talked about fame instead - willingly, at first. She&apos;s endured it for a long time. Bj\u00f6rk - born Bj\u00f6rk Gudmundsd\u00f3ttir in Reykjavik, Iceland, in 1965 - recorded her first album aged 11. &apos;There was a radio show where everybody who did something well, did something. One did magic tricks and one did, er, what you call it? Flick flacks? And I sang. Because that is what I did. On the school bus I would sing. All the time. And some guy contacted my mum and wanted to make a lot of money and do a child record, and my mum said: &quot;Yes.&quot; I can&apos;t even remember being asked.&apos; The album sold well, and Bj\u00f6rk became a star. Was that fun? &apos;No! I hated it! I didn&apos;t really like it. I think children should pick for themselves. They shouldn&apos;t be pushed. I was too young.&apos; Does she resent her mother for allowing it? &apos;Little bit. She should have known better.&apos; Bj\u00f6rk, child star, refused to make a second album, and ducked out of the whole business for several years. She formed a punk band called Spit and Snot when she was 14 - &apos;just at school, with four girls. It was fun. I played drums&apos; - but didn&apos;t release any more records until the mid-1980s. It was then that she gained international recognition as vocalist for the Sugarcubes, a post-punky, electro-ish Icelandic outfit, which sat well among the jangly guitars and whimsy of the UK&apos;s indie music scene. (I remember watching her prance around in the video for the 1987 hit &apos;Birthday&apos;, an Icelandic extravaganza of ice floes and lava and dark, soaring birds. I was wildly impressed by her unhinged impishness, and her sticky-out hair.) She married her Sugarcubes bassist, Thor Eldon, and gave birth to their son Sindri in 1986, aged 20. Which seems incredibly young to be a mother. &apos;Not in Iceland! Most people have &apos;em when they&apos;re about 16. It&apos;s rural out there.&apos; Bj\u00f6rk and Eldo split before Sindri was two - and their band split in 1992. Bj\u00f6rk launched herself as a solo artist with the critically acclaimed dance album Debut, in 1993, aged 27. At which point, she became truly famous, on a grander scale. How was it that time around? &apos;Well, it was fun to try it. If you had a paper in front of you, and like, you could pick things, before birth, that you would like to try, before you fall down and die; and that was one of the bubbles: A-list celebrity, try that out for a couple of months ... you&apos;d probably go: yes. Tick it. Just for the experience. And to be honest, I didn&apos;t really like it. It&apos;s pretty rubbish. It feels like a service job, a bit like washing toilets or something. It feels like you are somebody else&apos;s servant. But I can tick that one off, and move to, to ... to Spain, for a few months, and they forgot about me!&apos; Really? It was that easy to duck out? &apos;Yep!&apos; she says, with absolute satisfaction. &apos;For me anyway!&apos; Then I ask her what, it transpires, is the wrong question about fame, and Bj\u00f6rk gets mad. Maybe I should have anticipated it. In 1996, celebrity turned nasty for Bj\u00f6rk, when Ricardo Lopez, an obsessed fan, videoed himself making and mailing an acid bomb to the singer, before committing suicide. The police intercepted the device before Bj\u00f6rk opened it, but still; it must have been grim, and maybe my focusing on Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s fame triggered some associations. Or maybe she&apos;s just bored. I move on, ask questions designed to engage her as a musician. But it&apos;s too late. For 20 minutes of our precious hour together, Bj\u00f6rk is abrupt, cold, and hard: How does she write her songs? &apos;I mostly write on my own, walking, outside.&apos; Does she do this in London (where she still owns a house, just across the road from the hotel where we&apos;re sitting)? In New York (where she, Matthew Barney, Sindri, and four-year-old Isadora - her daughter with Barney - are based)? In Iceland (where she still spends half her time)? &apos;Wherever I am.&apos; You wake up, you get up, you go out, with writing as an end goal? &apos;Mmm hmmmm.&apos; Do you take a notebook? Or a Dictaphone? Do you write while you walk, or on park benches? &apos;It isn&apos;t really like that. You can&apos;t plan it.&apos; Then there&apos;s a long, uncomfortable pause. I ask Bj\u00f6rk about fashion. She&apos;s got strong associations with the industry; Alexander McQueen made her a frock for one of her videos, she&apos;s often championed the more challenging designs of people like Rei Kawakubo and Sophia Kokosolaki. Does she love fashion? &apos;Not really. I don&apos;t really like it.&apos; I look pointedly at the Westwood shoes, and Bj\u00f6rk relents a little. &apos;I like the creative angle. Where people express them-self. But I don&apos;t like it when it&apos;s too much of people being told what to do, and too much like ... fascism, of magazines telling women to starve them-self, and they obey! Or they&apos;re like &quot;out of fashion&quot;, which is the worst crime you could ever commit! So they get executed for it, publicly! It makes women very unhappy.&apos; Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s said in the past that she was surprised no one realised that the Oscar swan outfit was a joke - even though she periodically &apos;laid&apos; eggs on the red carpet (at which point security guards would tap her on the arm and say: &apos;Excuse me ma&apos;am. You&apos;ve dropped something&apos;). Now, she says: &apos;I think in Hollywood, if you don&apos;t wear black Armani, you get executed immediately. But mostly er, I&apos;m surprised it&apos;s still a big deal. I&apos;m surprised journalists are still talking about it.&apos; We don&apos;t have much imagination, I explain. Bj\u00f6rk laughs. She warms up a little; then I spoil it all and ask: how does she reconcile motherhood, with pop stardom? &apos;Ha! You asking me again what it&apos;s like being famous, right?&apos; No! I&apos;m asking you what it&apos;s like to have a very domesticated facet to your lifestyle, and also one that is traditionally associated with excess, high living, emotional volatility, drugs and groupies. &apos;Oh. Being a musician is very easy. My house is full of musical instruments. There&apos;s a lot of music, always. But... I don&apos;t really go to premieres and hang out with Puff Daddy.&apos; (I refrain from saying that I didn&apos;t for one moment think that she did, and that, furthermore, he&apos;s called P Diddy.) It isn&apos;t until Bj\u00f6rk has some room-service soup that things start to look up. She mellows considerably. &apos;It&apos;s my blood sugar,&apos; she explains. &apos;It goes a bit ... haywire.&apos; I ask her some more searching questions; and she responds well. Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s been with Matthew Barney for six years; before that, she&apos;d had a series of relationships, some of which were high-profile. She dated UK Nineties music institutions Tricky (of Massive Attack) and Goldie, for a start. The two were supposed to have fought over her. Does she fall in love easily? &apos;Erm. Hmmm.&apos; She giggles. &apos;I mean, there&apos;s been many different periods in my life ... there&apos;s definitely been places where I fell really easily in love. And, erm, all the different colours ... I think I&apos;m the sort of person who - I wouldn&apos;t play it safe. Again, if you have the ticky boxes in front of you, and you have all the different emotional feelings, to do with love ... then I think I wanted to taste all of them, at least once. I also wanted to taste rejection, I wanted to taste being heartbroken, being obsessed, I wanted to feel being superior, I wanted to feel being equal, I wanted to, erm, experience, being ecstatic, the joy, the freedom, the recklessness, the conservative side ... the domestic life ...&apos; And has she experienced all these things? &apos;All of these colours! Yeah!&apos; She seems fearless, romantically. Is she scared of anything? &apos;Yeah! Tons! Tons of stuff, but that&apos;s part of the fun, though, isn&apos;t it? And it&apos;s not like I said: OK, I decide, 17 March, I will be heartbroken ... it&apos;s not like that. And I look at my friends, and there are some people who play it safe, and they don&apos;t want to take risks.&apos; I&apos;m one of those, I tell her. &apos;But that&apos;s not bad, either! It is also brave to keep things together. That takes guts too.&apos; Bj\u00f6rk likes me in the end. We talk about shopping: &apos;I like it! But it really exhaust me. I get highs, to be totally honest, in second-hand shops. My hunting instinct, I expect, really kicks in.&apos; We talk about ageing. There&apos;s something very childlike about her, there&apos;s the 12-year-old boy in her spoken inflections, and the high-voltage eccentricities. She&apos;s also got the posture of someone much younger; and the skin. But still - she is 41. &apos;I&apos;m pretty comfortable with it when it comes to experience, maturity, er, wisdom; but I&apos;d be lying if I said that it don&apos;t piss me off that I don&apos;t have the same energy I used to have when I was 20.&apos; Where does she stand on the ravages of time? &apos;Right now, I feel like I look exhausted, because I&apos;m tired. I&apos;m not vain, like: I want to look pretty. That&apos;s never bothered me. But if I see a photograph of me and I look tired, then I&apos;d be more worried than if I looked ugly.&apos; She has a nice life; a sociable life, with her kids, her friends, and regular house parties, which she enjoys &apos;because you can be really picky about the music and only play what you like&apos;. She&apos;s about to tour Volta, which she thinks will be fine because she&apos;s negotiated a month-on, month-off deal with her label, so that she can spend time with Isadora. She likes a drink. &apos;I don&apos;t like drinking with food, I think Iceland people are a bit old-school like that - we think if you drink with food then you&apos;re an alcoholic ... but if you drink lots, on a Friday night ...&apos; Then you&apos;re fine? &apos;Yes. I think it&apos;s called &quot;binge drinking&quot;. I don&apos;t see the point of drinking unless you end up dancing and letting go. I actually read somewhere that, if you look over a 40-year period, it&apos;s better for your body because then you get rid of so much stress. Two glasses of wine, good for your heart? Yeah, whatever. I just wake up next day and I&apos;m a bit like, black and white, not in colour. But lots of drink, bit of dancing, bit of slapstick... is good! Thing is, you can&apos;t do that, that often. Twice a month would be good... but I can&apos;t wait, I think, fuck it!&apos; Is Bj\u00f6rk happy? &apos;I&apos;m just like anybody,&apos; she says, &apos;I have my ups and downs.&apos; She kicks her bare feet out a bit. &apos;It&apos;s not like bliss, 24/7 or anything.&apos; She sniffs. &apos;Shame about that, innit?&apos; Then she laughs, and boots me out of her hotel room. \u00b7 Bj\u00f6rk&apos;s next single, Innocence, is released on July 23", "publicationDate": "2007-07-07T23:03:20Z", "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music", "Life and style", "Culture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jul/08/popandrock2", "title": "Bj\u00f6rk interview: 'I didn't like being a celebrity.

So three cheers for William Gallas, whose latest outburst can be expected to have the same effect on Arsenal morale as a French spook&apos;s mine once had on the Rainbow Warrior&apos;s hull. Since the end of last season, Gallas&apos;s official website has been suggesting to the billions of internauts who no doubt land there every day that the centre-back&apos;s most memorable contribution to the Gunners&apos; last campaign was his &quot;unquestionable leadership&quot; and his &quot;seamless integration into the club&quot;.

Antti Niemi (he might be blond but he&apos;s not dumb) was so pleased to hear that Fulham have signed Diomansy Kamara from West Brom that he signed a two-year contract extension. Holland U-21 international Ryan Babel&apos;s Mr 15% has claimed Liverpool have made a bid for the Ajax winger. &quot;I can say nothing about transfer fees, but I can confirm that Liverpool have made a bid for Ryan,&quot; trumpeted Winnie Haatrecht. Sombreros with extra-wide brims were doffed as Me-hee-co! Me-hee-co! Ra! Ra!

The four quarter-finals produced 22 goals, just seven less than Manchester City scored in the Premiership last season. Having cracked under interrogation from the cream of the nation&apos;s hacks (ie not the Fiver) Lord Ferg has confessed that the Carlos Tevez-to-the-Rowdies transfer is almost a done deal. &quot;Maurice Watkins [club solicitor] has been working for the last month or maybe more than that on the whole deal to make sure everything is absolutely perfectly clear as far as we are concerned and there are no side issues,&quot; he screamed. Chelsea have agreed a fee with Lyon for midfielder Florent Malouda, who will cough for the Stamford Bridge medics later today. SundIreland are on the verge of paying \u00a33m for Southampton full-back Chris Baird. And Real Madrid have appointed former German international Bernd Schuster as their new coach, prompting Getafe to appoint former Denmark international Michael Laudrup as his replacement. &quot;This is a very happy day for me and I would like to thank the club for giving this opportunity to a young coach,&quot; one or both of them announced. * * * * * * * * * * FIVER LETTERS &quot;Having also &apos;won it five times&apos;, I hope that Roger Federer and his supporters take a lesson from the The Most Knowledgeable Fans in Football \u00a9 in how to not over-glorify this achievement and be magnanimous in slightly fortuitous victory&quot; - James Gibson.

Just as Mr Thaksin appeared to be within days of closing a \u00a381.6m deal to buy Manchester City football club, Thailand&apos;s highest court for the first time ordered him to answer accusations surrounding a multi-million pound land deal. But a lawyer acting as the billionaire telecoms tycoon&apos;s unofficial spokesman in Bangkok said his client - who has been living in London since he was toppled in bloodless coup last September - would not present himself before the tribunal as he feared for his safety should he return. The decision not to appear before the nine-judge panel on August 14 could hold up proceedings and slow the case, which may yet take many months. It could also complicate his ownership of Manchester City. The Football Association would be obliged to decide if Mr Thaksin, 57, qualifies as a &quot;fit and proper&quot; person to own the club should he ultimately be convicted in Thailand. Aides to the deposed premier insist the money he is using to gain a controlling stake in the club is clean. Mr Thaksin was already extremely wealthy before he become the Thai leader, but made a staggering \u00a3950m from the sale of his Shin Corp conglomerate last year. However, Mr Thaksin - who is accused jointly with his wife, Pojaman - could face 13 years jail and a fine of \u00a33,000 over the \u00a311.3m land deal in 2003 during his first term in office. Prosecutors allege that Mr Thaksin illegally helped his wife buy the piece of land at a bargain price from a government agency. The arrangement flouted anti-corruption laws that bar serving officials and politicians from conducting business deals with state institutions. A special committee set up by the military-appointed government to investigate wide-ranging corruption allegations against Mr Thaksin has already frozen about \u00a3900m of his assets in Thailand. The junta cited corruption as one of the main reasons for its decision to seize power but took nine months to bring the first charges. Mr Thaksin&apos;s Thai Rak Thai party was ordered disbanded for election fraud. Mr Thaksin and his wife were also ordered to return to Thailand by July 27 to face separate allegations of making false statements to stock exchange regulators. But Mr Thaksin&apos;s lawyer, Noppodol Pattama, said: &quot;Both of them will fight the case. But as of now the two defendants will not return ... on the grounds that the judicial process is still being interfered with.

Bjork at Live 8 in 2005. Photograph: Shizuo Kambayashi/AP It was revealed today that the Queen came over all sulky during a session with American portrait photographer Annie Leibovitz (though not as sulky as first appeared). It seems that this right royal tantrum was provoked when Leibovitz instructed her to remove her crown. Reacting in such a fashion, her maj was only obeying one of the time-honoured commandments that govern the behaviour of the rich and famous - exercising the divine right to spit dummy out of pram at the slightest provocation.  Here follows some of my favourite celebrity tantrums. Please feel free to suggest some of your own. Nothing like a spot of long-haul travel to fray the nerves. So it proved with Bjork as she passed through Suvarnabhumi airport in 1996. Greeted by a French television crew, Iceland&apos;s greatest export (puffin pie notwithstanding) hurled herself at reporter Julie Kaufman and proceeded to whale the tar out of her. The reason for Bjork&apos;s sudden cat fit? She objected to Kaufman addressing her son, Sindri, with the words, &quot;Welcome to Bangkok.&quot; It never took much to send Frank Sinatra into full-on tantrum mode. One morning he walked into his office at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas, started screaming and swearing, ripped the telephone out of the wall, broke some windows and set the room on fire. The cause of his annoyance? The colour of the telephone clashed with the new orange sweater that he was wearing. Quite understandable really. Elton John&apos;s hissy fits are a thing of legend. Perhaps the most famous of Reggie&apos;s Little Moments occurred in the late 70s when he was staying at The Inn on the Park in London. After staying up all night gorging himself on cockles and cocaine, he was a major huff waiting to happen. Ringing up his office, he tore a lengthy strip off the receptionist who eventually plucked up the courage to enquire what was wrong. &quot;It&apos;s too fucking windy outside,&quot; Elton raged, &quot;and I want someone to do something about it.&quot; Interviewing the Bee Gees on his chat show in 1997, Clive Anderson was in particularly insolent form. Noting that the band had once considered the name &quot;Les Tosseurs&quot;, Anderson quipped, &quot;You&apos;ll always be tossers to me&quot;. Without further ado, the three Gibb brothers marched out of the studio. In 1994, reportedly irked that girlfriend Kate Moss had made unflattering remarks about the size of his manhood, Johnny Depp lost his rag and ran amok in the presidential suite at New York&apos;s exclusive Mark Hotel. By way of novel excuse, Depp later blamed the extensive damage on, &quot;a dog, a rat, an armadillo and a cockroach the size of a baseball running wild.&quot; Top jazz drummer Buddy Rich had a temper like a hacksaw and it was customary for him to subject members of his band to almighty post-gig bollockings. The most extreme of these tantrums make Derek &amp; Clive routines sound like outtakes from an Enid Blyton audio book. Michael Winner once checked into a flight at Heathrow airport to find that he was booked into business class rather than his customary first. His dander went up when the check-in clerk refused to meet his demand for a free upgrade. &quot;Do you know who I am?&quot; Winner roared. At which the clerk turned to a colleague and calmly remarked, &quot;Can you help this gentleman? He appears to have forgotten his own name.&quot; In 2005, Russell Crowe&apos;s infamous temper blew up when he found himself unable to call home from his Manhattan hotel room. Storming down to reception, he picked up a telephone and lobbed it at the concierge causing, &quot;a laceration and severe pain.&quot; Crowe was reportedly sued for $11m but later settled out of court. According to the sales assistant who tried to serve her, actor Melanie Griffith came over all nuclear in an LA Apple store when informed that there were no pink iPod minis in stock. &quot;I was quite impressed to see her walk into the store,&quot; said the assistant. &quot;Then she started using me as a doormat. So I told her that her last movie sucked and that she should get the hell out.&quot; In May 2007, Britney Spears got into a strop on a United Airlines flight en route from LA to Miami. Six minutes before take-off, after loudly berating a stewardess, she demanded to be let off the flight. The reason? The plane did not have leather seats.", "publicationDate": "2007-07-12T15:48:45Z", "tags": ["Music"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/jul/12/atributetothehissyfit", "title": "A tribute to the hissy fit", "sentences": ["She objected to Kaufman addressing her son, Sindri, with the words, &quot;Welcome to Bangkok.&quot; It never took much to send Frank Sinatra into full-on tantrum mode."]}, {"article": "Dirk Kuyt has welcomed the increased competition for places at Liverpool but has warned that the busy summer of transfer activity will be wasted if Rafael Ben\u00edtez&apos;s side fail to start the season strongly. &quot;You can&apos;t win the title in the first few weeks of the season but you can certainly lose it,&quot; said the Dutchman after Liverpool continued their preparations with a comfortable 3-0 win against Crewe Alexandra. The Holland striker has good reason to be cautious even though Ben\u00edtez has spent nearly \u00a340m since Kuyt scored a consolation goal against Milan in the final of the Champions League. Despite their impressive European campaign, Liverpool&apos;s hopes of winning the Premiership last season were effectively over by November. By then they had won four of their first 10 league matches while Manchester United recorded eight wins from the same number of games. &quot;We had a slow start last season but this time it&apos;s important that we show we can do it from the start,&quot; added Kuyt, who faces competition from Fernando Torres and Andriy Voronin for a place in the side. &quot;I think it was a good thing to bring in a few new players. We certainly have to play much better than last year,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m not worried about my place. It&apos;s important to get players to make the team better and the competition at Liverpool is now stronger than ever.&quot; Kuyt was one of 22 players used at Crewe as Ben\u00edtez fielded completely different teams at the start of each half. Voronin, a free signing from Bayer Leverkusen, looked useful while Peter Crouch marked his first pre-season appearance with a goal. Lee Peltier and Ray Putterill, a member of last season&apos;s Youth Cup-winning side, also scored. Torres, the record signing at \u00a326m, was not risked as he is recovering from a minor ankle problem while the latest arrivals, Ryan Babel and Yossi Benayoun, are also expected to make their first appearances for the club this week. Liverpool headed off for a training camp in Switzerland and face Werder Bremen there tomorrow before playing Auxerre on Friday. Ben\u00edtez hopes to be joined by Lucas Leiva, the 20-year-old Brazilian midfielder who agreed to move to Anfield in May from Gremio in a \u00a35m deal. However, the deal is dependent on Leiva acquiring documentation allowing him to play in England and they reserve the right to cancel the move if they cannot secure the player&apos;s eligibility. Club officials have been working to secure an Italian passport for him and Ben\u00edtez is hopeful the documentation will be in place in time to allow the player to fly in this week. &quot;He is the captain of the Brazil Under-20 side and won the golden boot in his country last year, so we know he has quality,&quot; said Ben\u00edtez. &quot;We also believe he has the mentality and the character you need to do well in England.&quot; While Ben\u00edtez has a batch of new arrivals at his disposal, one of his signings last summer, F\u00e1bio Aur\u00e9lio, is unlikely to be fit in time for the start of the Premiership. The 27-year-old Brazilian left-back ruptured his achilles tendon during a Champions League tie against PSV in April. Another missing from the pre-season is Harry Kewell, although his absence is, for once, not down to injury but his participation in Australia&apos;s struttering Asian Cup campaign in Bangkok. Kewell dismissed suggestions of feuding factions within his national team after their 3-1 defeat by Iraq and a 1-1 draw with Oman. Meanwhile Jerzy Dudek, the Poland goalkeeper released by Liverpool this summer, is poised to join Real Madrid on a free transfer today, after admitting he had been approached by a Portuguese club, Feyenoord, Wolfsburg and had had &quot;an interesting offer from a respected newly promoted Premier League club&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2007-07-16T22:57:55Z", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Liverpool"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jul/16/newsstory.sport", "title": "Kuyt welcomes rival strikers to Anfield  to get league campaign off to flying start", "sentences": ["Another missing from the pre-season is Harry Kewell, although his absence is, for once, not down to injury but his participation in Australia&apos;s struttering Asian Cup campaign in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "High risk ... every year around 3,000 Britons find themselves behind bars. Photograph: Jeffrey L. Rotman/Corbis If you are about to head off on a gap year abroad or embark on a backpacking holiday in Asia or Latin America, bear in mind that every year around 3,000 Britons find themselves contemplating foreign scenery from the wrong side of prison bars, says Duncan Campbell. While some may be professional criminals, many are just unaware that a casual spliff on the beach might - just might - end up with a spell in the slammer. &quot;There is massive ignorance - or arrogance,&quot; says Pauline Crowe of Prisoners Abroad, the welfare organisation that helps Britons in foreign jails. She said that some travellers behaved in ways that they would not in Britain. &quot;The key factor seems to be the feeling that &apos;it won&apos;t happen to me&apos;.&quot; The arrests of two British teenagers in Ghana and the death of a young Briton in a police station in Brazil this month highlight the issue. The US, Spain, France, Australia and Thailand are the top five countries with British inmates, according to Prisoners Abroad. The highest proportion of prisoners are detained for drugs offences, with nearly half (46%) inside for that reason. The Foreign Office now issues advice on its web-site as part of their &quot;Know before you go&quot; campaign. Some travellers are unaware of the seriousness with which visa violations are regarded in a number of countries, imagining that they will just be told to leave if they are found to have overstayed. In Thailand, a major current issue is of Britons who overstay their visas and are being held for months in conditions worse than the notorious Bangkok Hilton, according to a former prisoner who has just returned to Britain.  John Davies, who was released from jail in Thailand after serving 17 years on a drugs charge, said that people who had failed to renew their visas or had their passports stolen were being kept in detention centres because the Foreign Office declined to pay for their repatriation. &quot;There are lots of Britons being held for months in Thailand in the detention centre just because their visas are out of date,&quot; said Davies. Davies, who is now back in Britain, said that every other country assisted their overstayers by lending them the money for the fare home. &quot;The Foreign Office doesn&apos;t give two hoots about them,&quot; he said.  A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said that there were currently 130 Britons detained in Thailand, of whom 10 were held at the immigration detention centre. The message from all the organisations, voluntary or state, is the same: respect the laws of whatever country you are in or you may become a news story yourself.  \u00b7 For more information see www.fairtrialsabroad.org and www.prisonersabroad.org.uk", "publicationDate": "2007-07-19T09:50:00Z", "tags": ["Travel", "Backpacking holidays"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2007/jul/19/couldacasualspliffonkosa", "title": "Could a casual spliff on Koh Samui cost you your freedom?", "sentences": ["In Thailand, a major current issue is of Britons who overstay their visas and are being held for months in conditions worse than the notorious Bangkok Hilton, according to a former prisoner who has just returned to Britain."]}, {"article": "As I type this, the two most active posts on Comment is free (as measured by the number of comments) are Mike Read&apos;s declaration of fealty to Boris Johnson, and Manish Vij&apos;s denunciation of Apu Nahasapeemapetilon (a character in The Simpsons) as a racist stereotype. It&apos;s probably an honour that neither author would choose, since the bulk of comments in both cases are derisive, verging on the contemptuous (albeit quite amusing). Indeed, the virtual kickings the two authors have received have prompted a number of expressions of sympathy and support, essentially arguing that the commenters have gone too far. These seem to tie in with a general mood that Cif, and the online media in general, has become cruel and uncouth, and that more sensitive souls feel inhibited from expressing their views because of the vitriolic responses they may provoke from readers who are often protected by anonymity. Some have gone so far as to argue that such responses are infested with racist and/or sexist attitudes. Civility is notoriously difficult to enforce; indeed, one could argue that if we need to enforce it, it&apos;s not really civility, just compliance with regulations. But complaining about such responses rather misses the point. All the blog format does is to allow readers to make public their thoughts on an article. There are those, such as Catherine Bennett, who complain that the blogosphere is too blokey, and they&apos;re probably right. But is a boorish online response to a Polly Toynbee article in 2007 - where the author may read it - any more heinous than a similar reaction when reading a Polly Toynbee article over the breakfast table in 1977? To paraphrase Bishop Berkeley, if someone hearing Mike Read smashing a record on Radio One in 1984 calls Mike Read an idiot and Mike Read doesn&apos;t hear it, does the listener still have a valid point?

I think the one saying that my photo made me look like a paedophile was removed. Now, consistency aside, these aren&apos;t very nice things to say about anyone. But thanks to the wonders of modern technology, I&apos;m able to wade in and defend myself (as Manish Vij has also done, to his credit).

Japan have been the stars of an Asian Cup first stage in which some of the continent&apos;s lesser lights, such as Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia, showed they could compete with the established powers, though home advantage is still necessary in order to do so. Vietnam are the only one of the four south-east Asian co-hosts in the quarter-finals despite a 4-1 thrashing by Japan in their final group game, during which Shunsuke Nakamura was again sublime. But even the Blue Samurai were slow to unsheathe their katanas. &quot;A bunch of amateurs,&quot; was what Osim called his charges after they let a 1-0 lead slip in the opening game against Qatar, reducing his interpreter to tears in the process. Australia&apos;s defensive hara-kari may well have had their boss Graham Arnold sobbing in Bangkok. A lucky 1-1 draw with Oman was followed by a comprehensive 3-1 defeat to Iraq. The team&apos;s debut in Asia was turning into a nightmare. Rifts in the &quot;Shockeroo&quot; camp were reported. One source said that &quot;when you have players whose priority is to lobby to be captain then the team suffers&quot;. Lucas Neill was thought to be one of the players auditioning for the armband that Mark Viduka will soon remove. Neill even stood up at dinner to apologise to his team-mates for an unnecessary red card, much to the shock of ex-Blackburn team-mate Brett Emerton, though Neill kept quiet about his pre-tournament prediction that the team would go all the way unbeaten. The road to the final in Jakarta on July 29 may no longer be unblemished but at least Australia are still on it after a 4-0 defeat of Thailand booked a quarter-final with Japan, who are desperate for revenge after their defeat to the Socceroos in the World Cup. Revenge is also on the mind of Arnold, who warned the source behind the rumours of discontent in the Aussie camp: &quot;I know who is behind all this&quot; before promising &quot;payback&quot;. Arnold denied the reports and additional accusations of arrogance towards Asian teams on the pitch and Asian culture off it. One SBS reporter described how some players would walk around their five-star Bangkok hotel half-naked after swimming pool sessions oblivious to the sensibilities of the guests, including many Muslim women who can at least be thankful that Mark Bosnich has retired. Culture shock works both ways however and the Socceroos were rightly put out at the timewasting of Oman -&quot;the snipers in the stands were busy&quot; observed Neill. Some Arabian teams have practised such tactics in Asia for years with goalkeepers perfecting the &apos;rolling wrist-clutch move&apos;. Seasoned Asian hands like Iran, Japan and South Korea know that the only way to frustrate the fakers is to score first. Korea did so against Saudi Arabia and Bahrain but beat neither and needed a last game win to progress. The Saudi match even included a 25-minute powercut, during which the players wandered around the pitch not knowing what to do. This was the natural state of affairs according to Middlesbrough striker Lee Dong-gook. Korean players are not ones for speaking out but, perhaps influenced by spending too much Teesside time with Marks Viduka and Schwarzer, Lee told reporters that Korea&apos;s tactics were &quot;monotonous and easy to read&quot;. Under-pressure boss Pim Verbeek told him to mind his own business. Korea face an inconsistent Iran in Kuala Lumpur, the pair&apos;s fourth successive Asian Cup quarter-final. Elsewhere, Iraq take on outsiders Vietnam while Saudi Arabia meet Uzbekistan. If Japan were the best team of the group phases, the passionate Indonesian supporters were the stars off the pitch and over 90,000 witnessed their team&apos;s exit in their final group game. Vietnamese fans also got behind their team but, even in Jakarta and Hanoi, attendances rarely reached five figures for games not involving the local heroes. It was worse elsewhere. Around 5,000 watched Australia&apos;s first match in Bangkok in a stadium that was only anywhere near full for the Socceroos&apos; clash with Thailand. It is best not to mention Malaysia, who fired their manager Norizan Bakar after losing 5-1 and 5-0 to China and Uzbekistan respectively. &quot;I apologise to all the spectators and want to shake their hands,&quot; said a member of the royal family from the Malay state of Pahang after the China game. It wouldn&apos;t have taken him long to do so. All games in Kuala Lumpur were played in front of rows of empty seats.

Australia, who were competing in the event for the first time after growing tired of the lack of decent competition in Fifa&apos;s Oceania Federation, would not have been the most popular of champions the way they set about trying to reach the last four. And nor did their penalty takers bestow much credit upon them. Their first two kicks, taken by Harry Kewell and Lucas Neill, were brilliantly saved by Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi, going first to his left and then to his right.  The venue, the My Dinh national stadium, is no relic of Vietnam&apos;s ancient past. Almost an exact replica of Real Mallorca&apos;s Son Moix stadium, it possesses every modern facility and, overlooked by tower blocks on the fringe of this capital city, it could be a world away from the temples and pagodas of Hanoi&apos;s old city. Since the Asian Federation were overwhelmed with volunteers, there are four host nations. Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand went out at the group stage, but Vietnam advanced to the other quarter-final played yesterday, in Bangkok. This doubtless explained why the stadium they left behind was not full to its capacity. But there was a decent enough quorum, with both teams enjoying the support of travelling fans. Vietnam ultimately lost 2-0 to Iraq in Thailand, a result that had tragic consequences in Baghdad. Though the progress of the team has been a brief distraction from the violence in Iraq, two people were killed and 15 injured after fans in the capital celebrated with aimless bursts of automatic fire. In today&apos;s quarter-final in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Iran play South Korea, with the winners to face Iraq. Saudi Arabia play Uzbekistan in Jakarta, Indonesia, for the right to face Japan. Seiichiro Maki flicked the first chance of the game wide for the victors in Hanoi, who survived a similar scare at the other end when Neill did likewise for Australia. Mark Schwarzer looked none too confident in Australia&apos;s goal as he fumbled shots from Yasuhito Endo and Naohiro Takahara either side of the interval, but he atoned with a full-length save from Kengo Nakamura as Japan began to get on top. The Middlesbrough goalkeeper was to excel again seconds from the end of extra time with a spectacular one-handed stop from Shunsuke Nakamura, but by then Australia&apos;s ambition was nothing more than to reach the shootout. That negativity came despite their taking the lead in the 69th minute, when a corner from substitute Kewell was met by John Aloisi&apos;s close-range shot, which went in off the bar. But Takahara soon seized on a loose clearance from Mark Milligan to equalise via an upright.  Japan should have settled the game long before the end of extra time but ultimately they did so anyway, albeit with the nerves of their supporters long since shredded. Their first three penalties were immaculate but when Takahara skied his kick, Nakazawa was asked to test Schwarzer&apos;s newly restored confidence.

The General  Dir. Buster Keaton, Clyde Bruckman, 1927 You say: It&apos;s really something for a movie from the Twenties still to make us laugh and for the audience to connect to the characters. Jon Wilde, Brighton We say: Not even Jack Benny has obtained so many laughs while remaining deadpan as the great silent comedian dubbed &apos;Old Stone Face&apos;. This American Civil War comedy about a Confederate engine driver defying northern guerrillas is Keaton&apos;s longest, best and funniest picture. The spectacular chases are as hair-raising as they are hilarious. PF 27. A Fish Called Wanda  Dir. Charles Crichton, 1988 You say: Not a dull moment and all four principal actors deliver flawlessly throughout. Robert Symington, Fernie, Canada We say: Directed by Ealing veteran Charles Crichton in 1988 from a script by John Cleese, this surprise hit briefly put London back on the global film map, earning three Oscar nominations. The culture-clash farce has Americans Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline coming to quaint London for a diamond robbery and becoming involved with Cleese&apos;s uptight barrister, Archie Leach (a play on Cary Grant&apos;s real name, of course). The comic stuttering and bungling of fellow Python Michael Palin provided some slapstick relief, Curtis gave it the glamour, while Cleese and Kline&apos;s verbal sparring lent the enterprise wit, class and cultural insight. &apos;I love robbing the English,&apos; says Kline, &apos;they&apos;re so polite.&apos; JS 28. Way Out West  Dir. James W Horne, 1937 You say: Human suffering is the staple ingredient of all good comedies; Laurel and Hardy present it with just the right measure of irony and dignity. William Wilde, London We say: The premise is as simple as ever. The hapless pair are hired to deliver the deeds to a goldmine to the daughter of a dead miner but unfortunately give it to the wrong woman. Cue: mad rush to put things right, cheesy song-and-dance routines and plenty of slapstick mishaps in frontierland. Arguably the duo&apos;s most enduring film. AO 29. The Odd Couple  Dir. Gene Saks, 1968 You say: Few films are funnier than this, with Jack Lemmon&apos;s neurotic chalk and Walter Matthau&apos;s slob of a piece of cheese caught together in domestic unbliss.Maggie Galpin, Manchester We say: Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon had combined to good effect for Billy Wilder&apos;s The Fortune Cookie but it took this Neil Simon script to cement them as one of the great comic pairings. Lemmon&apos;s Felix Ungar is a neurotic New Yorker recovering from divorce by moving in to share a flat with his slovenly poker game friend, Oscar Madison. Their bickering forms the backbone to a sharply observed film about male friendship, sweetened with a touch of the usual Simon sentimentality. Matthau, brandishing a note: &apos;&quot;We&apos;re out of cornflakes. FU.&quot; Took me three hours to figure out FU stood for Felix Ungar.&apos; JS 30. The Ladykillers  Dir. Alexander MacKendrick, 1955 You say: It&apos;s as if God decided to give his wayward children a masterclass in black comedy. Never equalled. Graham Hull, Nantwich We say: Ingenious and very funny Ealing comedy with Alec Guinness as a criminal who rents a room from an elderly landlady while plotting and executing a robbery. Mrs Wilberforce is not as oblivious as she seems, however, and Guinness&apos;s ragtag gang disintegrates as they struggle to knock the old dear off. The superlative cast also includes Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom. KF 31. The Blues Brothers Dir. John Landis, 1980 You say: Music, action and divinely inspired silliness triumph over insurmountable odds. Just looking at Belushi makes me laugh. Graham Low, Halifax We say: John Landis&apos;s spectacular film became a cult for music fans as well as comedy fans. Jake and Elwood, the titular brothers, were originally created by John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd on TV&apos;s Saturday Night Live. Their own 1980 movie saw them saving their former orphanage from a closure by re-forming their blues band for a benefit gig. Hence a rounding-up road trip in the Bluesmobile, wearing their trademark shades and pork pie hats, encountering James Brown, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin and John Lee Hooker. There&apos;s a cameo from Steven Spielberg, the most expensive filmed car chase and lots of gags. JS 32. Arsenic and Old Lace  Dir. Frank Capra, 1944 You say: &apos;Insanity runs in my family. It practically gallops.&apos; Old lady serial killers, horror pastiches and Cary Grant - what&apos;s not to love? Jayne Harvey, Oxford We say: Frank Capra&apos;s cheerfully macabre movie stars Cary Grant as a young newlywed revisiting his old family home in Brooklyn. Apart from two bachelor-poisoning aunts, a Teddy Roosevelt-impersonating brother who digs the graves and another serial-killer sibling who resembles Boris Karloff, the household is a picture of normality. Events unfold at chaotic speed and Capra applies his trademark light touch to the murderous material. KF 33. Bringing Up Baby  Dir. Howard Hawks, 1938 You say: Terrific verbal wit and physical comedy. Julia Henderson, Beverley We say: Funniest of the three polished movies Cary Grant made with Katharine Hepburn and the epitome of the screwball comedy, a term coined in the Thirties to describe a new kind of romantic, fast-moving sophisticated farce in which Noel Coward meets Ben Hecht. Hepburn plays the dizzy socialite luring bewildered palaeontologist Grant from the beaten track of his bluestocking fiancee. The sexual innuendo includes the first mainstream use of &apos;gay&apos;. PF 34. A Night at the Opera  Dir. Sam Wood, 1935 You say: Cocktail of comic wit and slapstick from the masters of mirthful mayhem. Jim King, Birmingham We say: The Marx brothers milked their status as madcap outsiders in this high society satire. The plot involves their high-energy attempts to help an Italian opera singer make it big in the States. The wisecracks are rapid fire and occasionally surreal. &apos;That&apos;s what they call a sanity clause&apos;; &apos;You don&apos;t fool me, there is no Santa Claus!&apos; The romantic subplot is sickly sweet but it is easy to see why this remained Groucho&apos;s favourite. AO 35. Kingpin  Dir. Bobby and Peter Farrelly, 1996 You say: A sleazy Bill Murray and milking a bull. What&apos;s not to like? James McCormick, Belfast We say: During the Nineties, the Farrelly brothers emerged as the leading figures in ultra-broad, fraternity comedy. Kingpin borrowed liberally from unlikely sources - Witness and The Hustler - to create a coming-of-age film in which ace 10-pin bowler Randy Quaid, an Amish naif, and his sleazy trainer Woody Harrelson unite to take revenge on Bill Murray. Worth seeing for Murray&apos;s outrageous hairpiece alone. AO 36. The Naked Gun  Dir. David Zucker, 1988 You say: The only film that has ever had me crying with laughter in the cinema. Mark Allen, Glossop We say: Based on a series of six TV programmes called Police Squad, which spoofed classic American shows such as Dragnet, the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team (ZAZ) expanded the concept into a movie largely due to the revived popularity of Fifties actor Leslie Nielsen as Lt Frank Drebin. A scene-stealing doctor in Airplane!, Nielsen&apos;s new creation filled the void left by Inspector Clouseau, and Drebin&apos;s haplessness was his comic virtue. The film&apos;s success - two less witty sequels followed - owed much to the revelatory comic playing of Priscilla Presley as Drebin&apos;s romantic interest Jane. &apos;Nice beaver,&apos; smiles Drebin, gazing up at Jane on a ladder. &apos;Thanks,&apos; she says producing a stuffed beaver, &apos;I just had it stuffed.&apos; JS 37. It&apos;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World  Dir. Stanley Kramer, 1963 You say: Never before or since have such an array of film&apos;s greatest comedians been brought together. Bill Needle, Kansas, USA We say: The overuse of the word &apos;mad&apos; is justified by this hellzapoppin&apos; chase film starring Mickey Rooney and Spencer Tracy. When a thief careens off a highway in the Californian desert, he tells witnesses about $350,000 buried under a &apos;big W&apos; in a park. Then he dies, leaving them to scramble for the money. Anyone with an aversion to slapstick should run a mile, but this nonsense of the gloriously silly variety. A sequel, with an extra &apos;mad&apos; in the title, is rumoured to be in the works. KF 38. Raising Arizona  Dir. Joel Coen, 1987 You say: Classic script, superb actors, beautifully filmed. Stephen Baker, Birmingham We say: Fans usually cite The Big Lebowski as the Coen brothers&apos; funniest, but this cracking comedy about the pitfalls of baby-kidnapping tickles as many ribs. An ex-con (Nicolas Cage) and an ex-cop (Holly Hunter), unable to conceive a child, decide to relieve a local furniture magnate of one of his quintuplets. Visually flamboyant, this film contains one of the most hilarious chase scenes. KF 39. Team America: World Police  Dir. Trey Parker, 2004 You say: Loses energy at the end but until that point, death, sex and stupidity all combine to create an assault on common decency. Seanan Oliver Manfred Kerr, Dublin We say: Thunderbirds go to hell in a movie that the British censors succinctly categorised as containing &apos;strong language, violence, sexual references and sex - all involving puppets&apos;! South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone deftly defecate on Alec Baldwin, Michael Moore, Kim Jong-il et al as Team America attempt to avert a disaster that will be like &apos;9/11, times a hundred... 91,100!&apos; MK 40. Trading Places  Dir. John Landis, 1983 You say: Brilliantly executed double act from Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd. Richard South, London We say: This delightful social comedy has two old Hollywood stars (Don Ameche, Ralph Bellamy) manipulating two young ones (Murphy, Aykroyd). Jamie Lee Curtis and Denholm Elliott bring sanity to the proceedings.PF 41. American Pie  Dir. Paul Weitz, 1999 You say: Extremely crude teenage flick, in terrible, cringey taste. But that&apos;s what makes the humour so great. Rachael Smith, Barnstaple We say: Four high-school friends vow to lose their virginity before prom night, prompting much desperation and partying. The iconic scene features Jason Biggs inserting his penis into his mum&apos;s freshly baked apple pie and being caught by his dad. JS 42. Hot Fuzz  Dir. Edgar Wright, 2007 You say: Great British slapstick humour. Linda Holder, St Austell We say: What happens when you transplant a police buddy-movie in the Bruckheimer style into the sort of sleepy West Country town usually reserved for polite English murder mysteries. KF 43. Love and Death  Dir. Woody Allen, 1975 You say: More laughs per minute than any other film, right up to the last scene. Ian Henry, Bangkok, Thailand We say: The last and most ambitious of Allen&apos;s &apos;early funny ones&apos;, this reworks The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment and War and Peace, with Eisenstein&apos;s Battleship Potemkin and Bergman&apos;s Seventh Seal thrown in. MK 44. Meet the Fockers  Dir. Jay Roach, 2004 You say: Oh so cringeworthy. Everyone&apos;s worst nightmare! Julia Butler, Bideford We say: Sequel to Meet the Parents tops the original because of inspired casting. Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman play Ben Stiller&apos;s hippie parents who outrage uptight Robert De Niro. AO 45. Sleeper  Dir. Woody Allen, 1973 You say: Probably Woody Allen&apos;s best pure comedy. Dylan Williams, Sheffield We say: Health-food nut Miles Monroe (Allen) is cryogenically frozen, then thawed out in a topsy-turvy future where smoking, deep fat and hot fudge are officially good for you and sex requires the use of an &apos;Orgasmatron&apos;. MK 46. South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut  Dir. Trey Parker, 1999 You say: Remarkably intelligent, politically perfect, with an unreasonable number of classic scenes and great songs. Rob Hunt, London We say: When our cartoon kids ape the swearing they hear in a Canadian film, their parents declare war on Canada. The film&apos;s enduring genius stems from brilliant pastiche musical songs. JS 47. Stir Crazy  Dir. Sidney Poitier, 1980 You say: Pryor and Wilder, a double act from heaven! Kevin Gough, Norwich We say: Framed for a bank robbery, Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder end up in prison, where the fun starts. The best movie of a sparkling partnership. AO 48. The Music Box  Dir. James Parrott, 1932 You say: Timeless and hilarious. Jonathan Lyndon Owen, Burnley We say: Laurel and Hardy are cinema&apos;s greatest double-act. This was their greatest film, in which they attempt to deliver a piano up a flight of steps.PF 49. Tootsie  Dir. Sydney Pollack, 1982 You say: Dustin Hoffman makes it so funny because he makes it believable.  Ann Hutchinson, London We say: A ripplingly inventive film which comments on the spectrum of New York showbiz while giving Hoffman a knockout role. PF 50. Uncle Buck  Dir. John Hughes, 1989 You say: John Candy is an underrated comic genius.John O&apos;Reilly, London We say: High japes as the titular character gives up his bachelor lifestyle to become an emergency babysitter. AO Philip French&apos;s verdict Straight laughs beat history lessons First off, it&apos;s an honest list. No one eager to impress you with their sophistication would name Meet the Fockers, Uncle Buck, American Pie and Kingpin as their favourite comedies. There&apos;s a lot of post-Animal House in-your-face farce here. Secondly, it largely reflects the tastes of younger readers or those more likely to send emails or post on our blog than dispatch a letter. It&apos;s overwhelmingly an Anglo-American, monoglot list. The only non-English speaking talent is Jacques Tati, Enoch Powell&apos;s favourite comedian, and he&apos;s represented by Mr Hulot&apos;s Holiday, where there&apos;s no intelligible dialogue in any language. This was perhaps predictable (indeed I did predict it in the introductory piece to this poll last month). Sad, but not entirely surprising, is the absence of Charlie Chaplin, one of the greatest figures in cinema history, but currently out of fashion. Still, this is a selection of readers&apos; favourite films, not a historical survey of film comedy. Thus the disappointing absence of such classic exponents of screen comedy, makers of milestone movies, as Ren\u00e9 Clair, Ernst Lubitsch and George Cukor, while Leo McCarey is here for Duck Soup but not for his screwball comedies, and Frank Capra is represented by the atypical Arsenic and Old Lace, not one of his 1930s comedies of populist social comment. As for Britain, the great music-hall comics Will Hay and George Formby no longer seem to make the grade, but then neither do the more recent Norman Wisdom, Rowan Atkinson (in his Mr Bean persona) and the Carry On team. It&apos;s good to see the laidback put-on artists Steve Martin and Bill Murray recognised. But I&apos;m surprised that Dead Men Don&apos;t Wear Plaid, Martin&apos;s brilliant film-noir spoof, hasn&apos;t made the cut. Because if there is one outstanding feature of this list it&apos;s the post-modernist liking for the jokey pastiche, the allusive, parodic, comically parasitic comedy that links at least a quarter of these pictures - films that depend, for instance, on a knowledge of the genre conventions of horror flicks, biblical epics, westerns, police-procedural movies, disaster flicks and documentaries.

In his golden diadem and sequined vest, the white monkey god strikes a fine figure. She rebuffs him just the same. The next thing you know, he is monkeying around us. One minute he&apos;s shadow-boxing with boys in the front; the next he&apos;s patting the bald pate of an American tourist at the back. But it&apos;s the women this charmer is really after. He accosts the Polish woman behind me: he snuggles up to her, strokes her hair, woos her in come-hither pantomime. Then he snatches her purse and takes off with it. For a kiss on his lacquered white cheek, Hanuman signals from the stage, she can redeem her bag. As she leans close, he whips his head round naughtily for a kiss on the lips. By now most of us spectators are reduced to helpless laughter. At the Traditional Puppet Theatre in Bangkok every night is a historic event. Although classical puppets go back a long way in Thailand, until recently Hanuman and his fellows were an extinct breed. Before his death in 1929 Master Krea, the last official puppet master, cursed anyone who dared try to emulate him. He wanted classical puppets to die with him, and they did - for half a century. Sakorn Yangkheowsod was a child actor in Master Krea&apos;s troupe. He inherited the dead master&apos;s surviving puppets from his widow. Soon he also began crafting his own. To preserve the tradition, Sakorn meticulously trained his several children (now all grown up) in the art of classical puppetry, staging performances for passers-by in a poor neighbourhood outside Bangkok. &quot;Father always loved dolls, toys and games,&quot; says Surin Yangkheowsod, the seventh of Sakorn&apos;s nine children, who manages the puppet theatre. &quot;We feel it&apos;s our entire family&apos;s obligation to continue his passion and legacy.&quot; On stage the troupe&apos;s uniformly dressed puppeteers (as many as three manipulating a single metre-high puppet) are in full view, dancing synchronously in a graceful ballet to the undulating tempo of a 10...#8209;man traditional orchestra of vocals, xylophones, flutes, cymbals, drums and gongs.

The Asian Football Confederation could have used Woolley&apos;s charms as they attempted to come to grips with the problems of staging a major tournament in four countries - Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. After Iraq&apos;s 2-0 quarter-final victory over Vietnam in Bangkok last Saturday, the Iraqi squad were told to wait until Monday to travel to Kuala Lumpur for the semi-final with South Korea two days later. They arrived to find their rooms at the hotel were still occupied by Iran. Perhaps after their quarter-final defeat to Korea on penalties, the Iranians were reluctant to return to Tehran where the city&apos;s dozen-plus sports papers were calling for the head of manager Amir Ghalenoei, who, in the words of Iranian football writer Kaveh Mahjoob, &quot;single-handedly destroyed what was inherited&quot;. Whatever the reason, the Iraqi boss Jorvan Vieira was fuming the next day. &quot;This is not a tourist group,&quot; he said. &quot;This is a football team in the semi-finals. I think the Koreans are in a better position than us now.&quot; They weren&apos;t at the end of the semi-final, as, after a 0-0 draw, Iraq triumphed 4-3 on penalties to book a final date with Saudi Arabia. The country was united in celebration, thousands dancing on the streets, Iraq flags draped over their shoulders. Sheep were slaughtered and vendors at ice cream and juice bars even gave away free treats. Sadly football was soon pushed off the front pages as car bombs ended 50 lives and the parties. A further two people were killed when bullets fired into the air in celebration fell back down to earth, with tragic results. Meanwhile despite their defeat to Iraq, Korea&apos;s tournament is not yet over. &quot;We will go for the third-and-fourth-place match. I think it&apos;s the most terrible game there is in football,&quot; explained their manager Pim Verbeek. Forcing a team to fly to another country for the game sounds cruel but there is a prize. As well as the two finalists, the nation that finishes third will qualify automatically for the 2011 competition though with Verbeek likely to resign soon, that may not be uppermost in his mind. Or Korea&apos;s as they may have to start looking for a sixth post-Hiddink manager. Japan will be Korea&apos;s opposition in the play-off and Japan boss Ivica Osim is definitely staying. The Bosnian has been as entertaining at press conferences as his team has been on the pitch. After the chaos of Germany 2006, Japan are playing as a team. &quot;Wasn&apos;t it more attractive the way we played?&quot; asked Osim after their 3-2 defeat against Saudi Arabia. &quot;It makes the game more open and shows beautiful football.&quot; After the fall of Australia and Iran at the quarter-finals, organisers wanted a Korea v Japan final - something that may have come close to filling the 90,000-capacity Gelora Bung Karno stadium in Jakarta. Sadly Iraq v Saudi Arabia is likely to be yet another Asian Cup game played in front of mostly empty seats. The Saudis don&apos;t care, of course, as they are in the final for the sixth time in seven tournaments. The team has been a revelation going forward, scoring 12 goals. Japan, and others, couldn&apos;t live with Yasser &quot;Sniper&quot; Al-Qahtani and the tiny but tricky Malek Maaz. &quot;Their two forwards were fierce,&quot; admitted Shunsuke Nakamura. According to the Saudi coach Helio Dos Anjos, the team&apos;s success is natural. &quot;There has been lots of studies done on the Saudi Arabian players&apos; DNA and genetically they are very, very good [for football],&quot; the Brazilian old reporters. &quot;But they need more muscle, muscle to be competitive.&quot; In the final, the Saudis need to stop Iraqi playmaker Nashat Akram who could soon be learning all about muscle as he wants to join Sunderland. &quot;Roy Keane was my favourite player, my hero. I watched him when I was young,&quot; the out-of-contract 23-year-old told reporters. &quot;I would be delighted to join his team and learn from him.&quot; Keane could teach Akram a few things about lifting trophies but while most neutrals would love to see Iraq win a first ever title on Sunday, Saudi firepower should see the bowl-shaped trophy heading to Riyadh for a record fourth time.", "publicationDate": "2007-07-27T11:47:55Z", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jul/27/sport.comment", "title": "Football: Asian Cup final preview between Iraq and Saudi Arabia", "sentences": ["After Iraq&apos;s 2-0 quarter-final victory over Vietnam in Bangkok last Saturday, the Iraqi squad were told to wait until Monday to travel to Kuala Lumpur for the semi-final with South Korea two days later."]}, {"article": "When Britain&apos;s athletics selectors meet in Birmingham today to choose the team for next month&apos;s world championships in Osaka, it will be like old times. They actually have something to create a heated debate over: should they name Mark Lewis-Francis or Simeon Williamson as the third man in the 100 metres? Not since 2000, when Lewis-Francis chose to compete at the world junior championships instead of the Olympic Games, has he been such a hot topic after a trials weekend. He was not expected to figure at the Manchester Regional Arena in a 100m where Marlon Devonish confirmed himself as the British No1 and Craig Pickering was a close second. Behind them was a revitalised Lewis-Francis, showing the determination that once made him the talk of the event. Donovan Bailey, the 1996 Olympic 100m champion, once tipped the Birmingham-born sprinter to succeed him in winning the sport&apos;s greatest prize. But since Lewis-Francis, now 24, became the world junior champion almost seven years ago, his performances in the 100m have generally been awful. The only time he has made a major final was at the Commonwealth Games in 2002 in Manchester when he finished seventh and left the stadium on a stretcher. &quot;I hope this run has silenced my critics,&quot; he said after finishing in 10.39sec behind Devonish, in 10.31, and Pickering, in 10.32, in a race into a severe headwind. &quot;I have never been happier with third place. I hope I am named in the team.&quot; The problem the selectors have is whether to take another chance with a sprinter who has let them down too often or opt for Williamson, the European Under-23 champion, the second quickest in Britain but a Manchester absentee because of illness. One of the criteria of the new selection regime is not to bring athletes just for the journey. Before Saturday evening, few people would have put the potential of Williamson behind that of Lewis- Francis. He had run 10.10 to beat Pickering at the European Under-23s and at 21 he is primed to reach his peak in time for the Olympic Games in London 2012. But Williamson has a dilemma of his own. He is in line to compete at the World Student Games which start in Bangkok on August 8 - the day after the team is finalised - and, if he decides to go, he would not be in the country to show his fitness to the selectors in Friday&apos;s grand prix at Crystal Palace.

Detainees, standing and sitting, are pressed hard against one another and the wire mesh that is their temporary prison. The deportees appear resigned to their fate. When the doors fly open, 140 men and a lone woman file out and down steep steps on the Thai side of the border to a waiting barge. No guards are needed. Fifteen metres across the muddy, fast-flowing Moei River they are back in their native Burma. Uniformed men herd them into a bamboo stockade of the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army, a rebel splinter group that has made peace with the Burmese junta. To win their liberty back in their homeland, each must pay the equivalent of \u00a325, a vast sum for impoverished labourers. Each year up to 100,000 deported migrants pass back this way. Social workers believe the DKBA is in league with corrupt Thai immigration staff who get a cut of the profits from these unofficial deportations. Burmese people-trafficking preys on the most desperate of people, fleeing conflict and poverty. It is a small part of a vast murky trade that buoys the Thai economy. At least 1.5 million Burmese work in Thai construction, fisheries and agriculture, filling poorly paid jobs shunned by Thais. Just a third are legally registered, leaving a million vulnerable to raids, deportation and extortion. In a safehouse in Mae Sot, a Thai border town awash with Burmese migrants, Moe Swe shelters those rescued from the DKBA&apos;s clutches and others who fled abusive employers. It is a perilous business. He briefly fled Thailand himself two years ago, after receiving death threats from powerful vested interests. &quot;We suspect the Thai officials get money from the DKBA for the deported migrants,&quot; he said. &quot;There are 20 landing stages on the river, but the workers are only released at the one known as Pier 999, opposite the DKBA&apos;s so-called reception centre.&quot; Two hundred garment factories and thousands of farms in Mae Sot thrive on cheap labour that floods across the porous border. Some of the 100,000 migrants here have work permits, but many do not. A squad of armed Thai border police last week staged a 4am raid 20 miles outside the town in Waylay village, a collection of bamboo shacks without running water or electricity. Half the 100 inhabitants, without work permits, ran. Four were caught and immediately deported. Wai Lin Oo, 18, heard no warning. It was a costly mistake. His mother Khin Thet, 40, rescued him by slipping across into Burma herself, but had to pay nearly \u00a310 from the family&apos;s meagre savings for a day-pass to bring him back. With other villagers, he scrapes a living planting roses, earning \u00a31 a day - half the minimum wage. Yet he is luckier than 11-year-old Win Htat Thu who gets work erratically laying chemical fertiliser around the roses without any protective clothing. Daily swoops &quot;We came because we hadn&apos;t enough money,&quot; said the boy, who receives no schooling. &quot;But here there&apos;s not enough either; just enough food. If any of us gets sick, there&apos;s no money for medicine.&quot; Bangkok&apos;s building sites and factories are the most lucrative workplaces. Although migrants there are paid as little as their rural cousins, the work is steadier, giving greater opportunity to earn. But getting a work permit is a minefield. Just 485,925 are registered, leaving a million Burmese working illegally. Hundreds are caught in daily swoops and held in Bangkok&apos;s immigration detention centre before being taken to Mae Sot, fuelling the corrupt trade in deportations from Pier 999 - whose suspicious operators did not welcome prying eyes. &quot;No pictures,&quot; hissed one, as the Guardian watched the caged trucks arrive and unload their human cargo, the fifth and sixth shipments of the morning. &quot;Who are they and what do they want?&quot; whispered another to the Burmese social worker accompanying us, who has seen the trade at first hand. Years in jail A month ago the plight of Kyaw Pha Dae, 15, led the social worker to the DKBA camp to buy his freedom. Capture could have cost her years in jail. She found him in the Bangkok detention centre and followed him when he was deported. Kyaw Pha Dae last saw his family a year ago after he was sent to work on a Thai fishing boat in the Andaman Sea. The boy, from the Karen village of Kyat Ma Out, had never seen the sea. &quot;When I went on the boat I was scared that I would fall overboard,&quot; he said, now in the Mae Sot safehouse. &quot;I got seasick too. But I was really afraid after the boat owner dropped me on a pier in Bangkok. I had no idea what was going to happen next.&quot; The flow of Burmese migrants across the lengthy border that cuts through jungle-clad mountains is just one part of the equation. It is mirrored by huge business investments that wealthy Thais have made in Burma. One fly in the ointment is the drug yaba - a meta-amphetamine - produced in Burmese jungle laboratories and smuggled in vast quantities into Thailand. But the desire for the smooth running of big business ensures tensions never get too strained. The ousted Thai prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, who himself had vast business interests in Burma, invested much political capital trying to bring Burma&apos;s rulers into the international fold. But despite his failure, the interlinked business interests keep relations stable and border tensions - on an official level, at least - to a minimum. Backstory Mae Sot is every bit the frontier town, the wild west of Thailand - but with an almost entirely Burmese cast. It is filled with migrants trying to make ends meet, dissidents fleeing the Burmese junta, and its conspicuous &quot;spooks&quot;. Markets by the riverside sell every conceivable kind of smuggled duty-free commodity, though cigarettes are the favoured currency. A Friendship Bridge crosses the Moei river with a checkpoint and the odd car. Spoil from construction has formed river islands that have become disputed territory. But crammed boats ply Mae Sot&apos;s numerous piers across the border river, with not an official in sight. The far bank&apos;s Karen state is controlled by the Burmese junta, known as the State Peace and Development Council, and the DKBA, which split from the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA). The state capital, Manerplaw, fell in 1995 to DKBA forces backed by the junta. But sporadic fighting continues as the army attacks the KNLA, driving refugees and migrants across the border.", "publicationDate": "2007-07-31T22:55:31Z", "tags": ["World news", "Thailand", "Organised crime", "Asia Pacific", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/31/burma.thailand", "title": "Porous Burma-Thai border  fuels rich trade in migrant misery", "sentences": ["If any of us gets sick, there&apos;s no money for medicine.&quot; Bangkok&apos;s building sites and factories are the most lucrative workplaces.", "Hundreds are caught in daily swoops and held in Bangkok&apos;s immigration detention centre before being taken to Mae Sot, fuelling the corrupt trade in deportations from Pier 999 - whose suspicious operators did not welcome prying eyes.", "She found him in the Bangkok detention centre and followed him when he was deported.", "But I was really afraid after the boat owner dropped me on a pier in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Mark Lewis-Francis must put himself through the rigours of a second trial at the Norwich Union London grand prix at Crystal Palace on Friday to show Britain&apos;s selectors he is good enough to be in the individual 100 metres team for this month&apos;s world championships in Osaka.

What we have to take from this decision is that the door is not closed, so hopefully on Friday night he will do something special and the matter is over.&quot; Lewis-Francis was not happy when he received the news from John Trower, one of Britain&apos;s senior performance managers in a phone call at 8pm on Monday after the selectors had met. &quot;He rang me and the phone was like that . . . &quot; said Lester, stretching out his left arm to show how he had to hold the handset away from his ear because of the volume in Lewis-Francis&apos; voice. &quot;He said &apos;they have not picked me&apos;,&quot; added Lester. &quot;I was a bit shocked but I kind of expected it.&quot; Even though he had ticked almost all of the boxes for a place in Osaka, Lewis-Francis, 24, the world junior 100m champion in 2000, has failed to reach a major 100m final since the Commonwealth Games in Manchester and has not run quicker this summer than the Londoner Simeon Williamson, who has a season&apos;s best of 10.10sec but missed the trials because of illness. Williamson will not be at the Palace. He has flown out to Bangkok for the World Student Games which start a week today - 24 hours after Britain&apos;s deadline for naming the rest of the team. The International Association of Athletics Federations allows nations to select four competitors in each event, declaring their best three before the start of the championships. It is likely that will be the scenario here but if Lewis-Francis does not run well in London he might not be selected at all. Dave Collins, the UK Athletics&apos; national performance director, hinted the final place could be open to others such as Jason Gardener and Tyrone Edgar. &quot;There are a number of athletes who have the qualifying time,&quot; said Collins. &quot;We are looking to pick the best team. Mark is a changed athlete and ran well through the rounds [on Saturday]. But I have the opportunity to wait and see how others compete on Friday.&quot; A place in the women&apos;s 800m has been left open - and it could go to the European bronze medallist Becky Lyne even if she does not win on Friday night. One of the criteria for championship teams is taking athletes as medal prospects in years to come and even though she has only just returned after injury she is seen as a future star. The Commonwealth Games 400m champion Christine Ohuruogu could be in both the 400m and 4x400m relay. Her time trial on Thursday at Crystal Palace will determine her fitness after her year suspension for missing three drugs tests and she could make an instant return.", "publicationDate": "2007-07-31T23:10:52Z", "tags": ["Athletics", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/aug/01/athletics.sport", "title": "Athletics: Lewis-Francis irate at second trial for individual sprint spot", "sentences": ["He has flown out to Bangkok for the World Student Games which start a week today - 24 hours after Britain&apos;s deadline for naming the rest of the team."]}, {"article": "It would require the deployment of trebuchets and battering rams for Heathrow airport to feel more besieged than it has this previous week. The economic secretary to the Treasury, Kitty Ussher, identified &quot;the Heathrow hassle&quot; as a factor damaging the City&apos;s status as a financial centre. The mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, said the wretched terminus &quot;shames London&quot;. John Tincey, of the Immigration Service Union, observed that passport control queues were longer than many short haul international flights. A survey of Heathrow&apos;s recent coverage would leave a neutral observer imagining that, were some or other yahoos to attempt a Glasgow airport-style assault upon the place, they would barely be able to see to steer their car bomb through the rose petals flung by grateful citizens. The opprobrium piled upon Heathrow, while largely merited, misses a crucial point. The key to understanding the ghastliness of Heathrow airport is not the &quot;Heathrow&quot; but the &quot;airport&quot;. I spend a lot of time in airports, and can confidently declare Heathrow no worse than most. Airports are full of people who, by definition, wish they were somewhere else. Perhaps for this reason, no consideration appears to be given to making airports pleasant environments in which to be. The queues and the pettifogging security checks probably can&apos;t be helped. The overwhelming, dispiriting characterlessness of the places can. In 2007 alone, I&apos;ve used the airports of London, Sydney, Melbourne, New York, Bucharest, Graz, Caracas, Nice, Bangkok and Singapore. Any one of them could have been any of the others: the same Speer-meets-Starck architecture, the same Dan Brown books on the racks, the same posters of David Beckham in stupid sunglasses, the same bloody awful food, the same piped pop pabulum. The only one that distinguished itself in my recent travels was Mehrabad airport in Tehran, which, while a decrepit dump, at least flaunted some local character - the Islamically correct gender-divided entrances to security screening; the huge gilt-framed tapestries unfathomably offered in duty free. The fault is a cultural one with the airline industry in general, not merely Heathrow in particular. Possibly in a bid to relax us about hurtling through the sky at 1,000 kilometres an hour, airports aim to make the experience seem boring and ordinary. That they have been rather too successful at this can be confirmed by surveying the morose, defeated herd known as the travelling public. Airports - especially Heathrow, which handles more international passengers than any other - should reconnect themselves and ourselves with the staggering accomplishment of modern air travel, which has done more to promote a global consciousness than anything else we&apos;ve ever done. For those awaiting departure, there could be aviation museums instead of shops, galleries instead of theme pubs, pilots lecturing on the marvels of their trade. For those arriving, an airport should at least say something about the city it serves - other, that is, than the current default, of Heathrow and all other ports of arrival on our querulous planet, of: &quot;Who the hell are you, and what do you want?&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-08-02T08:00:00Z", "tags": ["Travel and transport", "Airline industry", "Architecture", "Art and design", "Culture", "Transport", "UK news", "Environment", "Heathrow airport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/02/handsoffheathrow", "title": "No departures from the norm", "sentences": ["In 2007 alone, I&apos;ve used the airports of London, Sydney, Melbourne, New York, Bucharest, Graz, Caracas, Nice, Bangkok and Singapore."]}, {"article": "The Manchester City manager Sven-Goran Eriksson today continued his Eastlands rebuilding job by completing the signings of the Brazil midfielder Elano from Shakhtar Donetsk, Real Sociedad&apos;s Javier Garrido and the Dinamo Zagreb defender Vedran Corluka. Elano, who was hailed as &quot;the symbol of the new Brazil&quot; by his national coach Dunga after the player helped the team win the Copa Am\u00e9rica, has joined for a fee of \u00a38m. The 21-year-old Corluka arrives for an undisclosed fee, although reports from Croatia suggest City have paid around \u00a37m for his services, while Garrido has joined from Chris Coleman&apos;s side for \u00a31.5m. The trio join Rolando Bianchi, Martin Petrov, Gelson Fernandes and Geovanni as Eriksson&apos;s summer signings. Eriksson, with the backing of City&apos;s new chairman Thaksin Shinawatra, is working at a fierce pace in the transfer market with the start of the Premiership season only nine days away, and the Bulgaria striker Valeri Bojinov has also claimed he is about to join his compatriot Petrov at the club. Elano, 26, and Garrido have agreed four-year deals at Eastlands with Corluka committing for five, subject to a work permit. &quot;This morning has proved to be an immensely productive one, the outcome of which is the acquisition of three top-quality players for Manchester City,&quot; said the club&apos;s chief executive Alistair Mackintosh. &quot;This has been achieved as a result of some tremendous team work and I would like to praise everyone involved for their efforts.

So much for UK Athletics spending extra funding on priming their relay runners for this month&apos;s world championships in Osaka; as farewells go, Gardener&apos;s goodbye will stick in the mind after he had run a slick opening leg. Pickering took over but his 100m straight ended in a mess as Devonish never gripped the baton - and Britain were out. &quot;It is my fault,&quot; said Devonish. &quot;I take full responsibility. I put my hand back and I panicked slightly. I am bitterly disappointed; we will fix things before Osaka and hopefully it will not happen again.&quot; Britain have a special relay training camp in Loughborough next week which Gardener was due to attend as he planned his last race for Osaka. But last night it sounded as if he might not run again. &quot;I wasn&apos;t too nervous on the start line,&quot; said Gardener. &quot;I felt it on the bus here, thinking it is my last journey to a major meeting in Britain. But now it is time to move on. We will have to see.&quot; &quot;As far I&apos;m concerned, at the end of the season that&apos;s it,&quot; he said. &quot;I have made my decision that I have got to the end of the road as a competing athlete. It has been a really good career but I want to move in a new direction. &quot;I have never wanted to go to the championships to make up the numbers. I have always wanted to win and it looks like I am not in that shape now. So at the end of the season that&apos;s it. I&apos;m finished.&quot; As Gardener began his retirement party, Mark Lewis-Francis was still left anxiously waiting for an invitation to the bash of the year. He will spend the next 48 hours hoping his fifth place against the American Tyson Gay will be enough to earn him the final berth in Britain&apos;s 100m team for the world championships which start three weeks today. &quot;I hope I have done enough,&quot; said Lewis-Francis. &quot;When I received the call to tell me that I was not picked in the first place, it broke my heart.&quot; A week ago at the world championships trials in Manchester, Lewis-Francis finished third behind Devonish and Pickering and, in the initial wave of names for the team, he was chosen for only the relay. The selectors could not make up their minds between an athlete who has not reached a major 100m final for five years or Simeon Williamson, the Londoner who missed the trials with illness. They would not have learned too much at the end of what became nothing more than an ordinary, and routine, win for Gay, the fastest man in the world, who triumphed in 10.02sec into a headwind. Lewis-Francis had looked more impressive in the semi-finals when he finished second in 10.23 in what became the final individual 100m of Gardener&apos;s career. He was fifth in 10.41 and failed to progress. So nervous was Lewis-Francis that he sparked a false start in the final and, though he made an excellent start at the second attempt, by halfway Gay had stretched the field. Francis Obikwelu, of Portugal, was second in 10.18 with Devonish third in 10.26 followed by Pickering in 10.28. Williamson has run faster than Lewis-Francis this summer - 10.10 compared with 10.19 - and he competes at the World Student Games which start in Bangkok on Wednesday. The selectors may decide to take them both to Osaka and decide then because Lewis-Francis did not convince that he deserves a place in an event which could be spectacular. It will be the first time Gay and Jamaica&apos;s world record-holder Asafa Powell meet this year. Tim Benjamin is on his way to Japan, after producing his fastest time for two years when he finished fifth in the 400m in 45.28 as America&apos;s Olympic champion Jeremy Wariner won in 44.05. Benjamin, the former European No1, is back with his old coach Tony Lester after a nine-month spell with Colin Jackson. Like Lewis-Francis, Becky Lyne&apos;s fate is with the selectors. The European 800m bronze medallist was fifth last night in 2.00.86 after a season disrupted by injury in a race won by Lucia Klocova, of Slovakia, in 1.59.91 and she will now wait to see if she is given a place. Chris Tomlinson left it late, as he did in Manchester, before winning the long jump with the penultimate leap of the competition with 8.16m to beat the American Brian Johnson&apos;s 8.14m. He was the only British winner in the night&apos;s major events. He later revealed he almost retired after being hit financially because he had competed so little in the last year with injury. &quot;Four months ago, after the indoor season, I was considering quitting,&quot; he said. &quot;I had lost my funding, I had no money and I even had to rent out my house just to stay in the sport.

Pre-season used to be a dreaded phrase. It meant fines for overweight players and a brutal blow-out-the-cobwebs training regime to blast the summer holiday excess out of you. You&apos;d come back from Tenerife, Spain or Dublin - having stuffed your face full with burgers and ice creams - and the first thing the gaffer would say was: &apos;Right. Five-mile cross country run.&apos; I don&apos;t think I ever ran a whole cross country. I dreaded it. I just couldn&apos;t do it. Anything over 10 minutes and I was knackered. Back then it was perfectly normal for people to turn up carrying a bit of Terry Waite. It was all the usual suspects - I won&apos;t name names, they know who they are - and they usually carried it through the season. I remember Macca [Steve McManaman] at Liverpool was the envy of the dressing room as he never seemed to put on weight, no matter how many sausage sandwiches he ate. You get so used to burning calories during the season you get a bit of a shock when you lay around in the summer holidays and the weight piles on. Nowadays, I take a few days off to indulge in fried breakfasts and the like, but then it&apos;s straight back in the gym. I get issued with a close-season training programme - there was no such thing in the old days, probably the reason why one summer I hit 17st. It was a bit of a shock. I&apos;d done the Armani campaign and the following season they asked me to do another one, except this time I was not in shape at all. I remember the guy telling me to do some extra sit-ups, but it wasn&apos;t enough to do the campaign. For some players the fitness flurry used to come right at the end of the season when they&apos;d hit the weights to try to get the ultimate beach body. The reserve players were the worst for that; they&apos;d be there early doors packing out the gym, doing as many weights as they could to look good on their holiday. For a really last-minute buff look, the nightclub toilets trick never failed, or so I&apos;ve been told by a few of the lads over the years. Apparently - and I swear I have never done this - to impress the girls at a club they used to get down and do a few press-ups in the toilets. It pumped up the muscles, although you had to have a tight top on otherwise you were wasting your time. In the old days it was common practice to take the summer off from training - it was considered your fun time. But these days I&apos;m a total square. I phone my physio even when I&apos;m away with the family and I&apos;ll always go somewhere with a gym, or a personal trainer. As a young lad at Watford I&apos;d spend the summers labouring, painting and decorating - not to keep fit, but just because I was bored and didn&apos;t have any friends. And I was skint on \u00a327 a week. One year a mate and I went to Tenerife with about \u00a390 between us. It was a disaster. We spent \u00a335 in duty free on batteries for a stereo. We lived off pasta and water for the week. It was at Liverpool that I really started going on big summer holidays. It became the trend then. There was more money about and people started travelling to exotic destinations. Florida was a popular one. I went there with Ian Wright and his family to do some promotional work for Sport Disney - whatever that was, I don&apos;t even know if it still exists. I&apos;ve got photos of the two of us going on one of those bungee jumps, grinning like excited children. And a really tacky, sepia-style photo of me and Wrighty dressed up as soldiers from the American Civil War. I had that glued to my fridge door for years. The young lads always got excited about the summer holidays. They&apos;d be out booking trips to Bournemouth or a weekend in Dublin. And as football got bigger and more affluent the destinations followed suit. Going off to Ireland, then France and Tenerife changed to Vegas and more obscure destinations. Our big thing used to be Florida. I would take the whole family and the first thing we&apos;d do when we got out there was go to Denny&apos;s. It was almost a religious obsession. A Denny&apos;s all-you-can-eat breakfast - The Grand Slam - waffles, pancakes and everything I now know is bad for you. One year 10 of the family went to LA and hired a 15-seat minibus to drive round in. It was there that I got a bit of a thing for the Hard Rock Cafes. No one in the family escapes my obsessions and every time we saw a Hard Rock Cafe we had to go in, eat and get a badge. I was collecting badges and teddy bears then. I&apos;ve still got them in a box somewhere, waiting to show the grandkids. Nowadays most footballers wouldn&apos;t even consider eating all that junk. Nobody at the club even needs to say &apos;Don&apos;t come back fat&apos; any more. The emphasis has changed to how fit you&apos;ll come back. Players look at test results on the wall and make comparisons, gloating or giving each other stick. The old system never did work anyway. Fining people would get you a load of money, but that was about it. The fans rarely need to sing that song about being fat these days. But then there isn&apos;t any exact correlation between physical appearance and physical fitness anyway. Having got changed with some of the best players in the world I can tell you that a lot of their physiques would surprise you. You look at them and think: &apos;Wow, how do they run all day without looking like Adonis?&apos; And then you see players chiselled as hell, but they can&apos;t run for toffee. This year was my twenty-first pre-season as a footballer and the trips have changed beyond recognition. From the ubiquitous friendlies in Scandinavia 20 years ago to the bizarre - handing out kickboxing medals with Ice T in Bangkok while on a trip with Man City - the world of pre-season football has become a very different place. I will always miss my American holiday feasts, but football has become a faster more competitive environment. If staying at the top means slaving away on the treadmill during a family holiday in Marbella, then sod diners, ice creams, teddies and badges - at the top is where I want to be.

It is customary at this time of year to mention that returning English football is over-hyped, over-paid, over-exposed and excessively litigious, but that was just last season. Most sports are going to look a little vulgar when set against genteel pursuits such as cricket and golf, yet the new Premier League season is lining up to be more garish than a fully lit fairground, complete (obviously) with runaway roller coaster. Ride on the ghost train, anyone? Here&apos;s Noppadon Pattama, Thaksin Shinawatra&apos;s Bangkok-based lawyer, explaining why his boss is an ideal person to take over Manchester City: &apos;There has never been a proper probe. His Excellency has never ordered any official to kill anyone.&apos; Great. Say what you like about Peter Swales, and plenty did, but he never had to defend himself to Human Rights Watch. Moving swiftly on, here&apos;s that out-of-control, claret-and-blue roller coaster. It cannot stop, because once you have agreed to pay Lucas Neill \u00a370k a week then clearly you must have loads of money for Craig Bellamy and Freddie Ljungberg, and the Hammers are afraid to try the brakes for even a moment for fear of the loud squealing noise that would come from Sheffield United. Into the hall of mirrors, and Rafa Benitez must be looking at a particularly distorted reflection each morning if he fancies himself with that goatee. In terms of delivering the title, that is. No manager with distracting facial hair has ever won the Premier League, and, although no betting exchange is offering odds on the prospect, it is highly unlikely the rule will be broken. Benitez has spent big but mostly on strikers. He cannot play them all, and he will need to find his most potent formation quickly, and stick to it, to propel Liverpool into title contention. Being Benitez, sticking to a line-up might prove the problem. The role of traditional strongman is played by Martin Jol - see how many midfielders he can pick up at once - and this is the season Spurs are supposed to test their strength against weak and puny Arsenal. Spurs certainly look strong. They have not only kept their best players but signed a few more useful ones. Whether Arsenal turn out to be the stooges everyone seems to expect is one of the season&apos;s most intriguing questions. It might not be all doom and gloom post-Thierry Henry. Arsene Wenger is still an astute and experienced manager and Arsenal spent most of last season learning to cope without Henry. The Gunners could be this season&apos;s dark horses, a position they would undoubtedly enjoy, and if Tottenham are to make inroads it might have to be at the expense of Liverpool or Chelsea. Which will not be easy. Nor will wresting the title from a Manchester United pumped up by the additions of Owen Hargreaves and Carlos Tevez, and still threatening to produce even more from Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney than we saw last season. Making a forecast is most difficult of all. On the face of it, if United were stronger than Chelsea last season they should be stronger still now - they have brought in more players and their average age is younger. But you never know whether Rooney and Tevez will form an unstoppable goal machine or get in each other&apos;s way. Supposing Andriy Shevchenko starts rattling them in at Stamford Bridge, or Fernando Torres proves an instant hit at Anfield? After being widely derided last season for unwisely suggesting United might not score enough goals and Reading would go straight back down, I intend to be much more cautious with my predictions this time. Please be sparing with the hate mail if I happen to get a few things wrong. There has never been a proper probe. This is only football and, though I don&apos;t have a Bangkok-based lawyer to vouch for me, I promise I never had anyone killed.

Offenders who refuse to heed superiors&apos; warnings to mend their ways will find themselves shamed into doing so - forced to wear a hot pink armband adorned with the Japanese cartoon character Hello Kitty, beloved of little girls. Frustrated senior officers searching for ways to force their underlings to toe the line believe the cutesy armband will be sufficiently humiliating to deter policemen from further misdemeanours. It would prove a stark contrast to the figure-hugging grey uniforms, highly polished black knee boots, white helmets and mirror shades that mean most Thai police could pass as US motorcycle cops. Police who are late for duty, get into fights with colleagues and park in restricted zones will be the prime targets for this most novel of disciplinary procedures. But wearing the armband - Hello Kitty portrayed lounging on two hearts - for a day is for first-time offenders only.

The toss &quot;If we lose the toss, we&apos;re ******,&quot; says Rob Smyth. &quot;That&apos;s what I&apos;m saying.&quot; And Michael Vaughan has lost it. Or rather, Rahul Dravid has won it. They&apos;re going to bat on an excellent pitch under the glorious London sunshine. Teams England AJ Strauss, AN Cook, MP Vaughan, KP Pietersen, PD Collingwood, IR Bell, MJ Prior, CT Tremlett, RJ Sidebottom, MS Panesar, JM Anderson. India W Jaffer, KD Karthik, R Dravid, SR Tendulkar, SC Ganguly, VVS Laxman, MS Dhoni, A Kumble, Z Khan, RP Singh, Sreesanth. Chris Tremlett has recovered from a shoulder injury, and he has a crucial role to play this morning on a hard, dry pitch that should produce steepling bounce. Two years ago England came to The Oval requiring a draw for a historic series victory. They won the toss, batted first and, with a little help from the weather, became heroes. But that team is no more. Now it is India&apos;s turn to secure a historic series victory in south London. Despite their tradition of blowing series deciders, it will take something special for India&apos;s galacticos to let slip this opportunity to triumph here for the first time since Kapil Dev&apos;s rabble in 1986, thus inflicting England&apos;s first home series defeat in 11. The experts&apos; view &quot;England should be delighted they&apos;ve won the toss because they can really rough them up this morning,&quot; says Beefy. &quot;I think he&apos;s mad,&quot; says Athers. &quot;C&apos;mon!&quot; implores James Andrews. &quot;I want us to knock India over for 250, I believe it can happen. But then I still haven&apos;t given up on six months of passion with Angelina Jolie before settling down with Scarlett Johanson for a few years.&quot; &quot;I had been hoping England wouldn&apos;t lose the toss, and you wouldn&apos;t be commentating,&quot; says Nick Brice. Same here, Nick. &quot;You seem to be the bringer of misfortune. Sorry, but we&apos;re doomed.&quot; England really have had no luck in this series. &quot;What is the problem? They&apos;re only beans!&quot; says Ravi Shastri. &quot;That&apos;s standard staple food for the Indians. The English are charming hosts.&quot; I played cricket on Monday. Now admittedly I was a little rusty. But the mockery afforded to me by my team-mates for my batting efforts was totally unwarranted. Not only did I score 19 valuable runs before being undone by the express pace of the opposition&apos;s stocky 14-year-old, I was also handed the role by the captain of being the tea-watchman. I WAS OUT THE BALL BEFORE TEA - the very definition of a tea-watchman! Has any other cricketer been so unfairly maligned for following the orders of his skipper? &quot;Let&apos;s try for some first morning positivity,&quot; demands Peter Moor - sorrry, Indy Neogy as Jerusalem is belted out around Fiver Towers. &quot;You can&apos;t always win the toss, this has to be treated as an opportunity for England&apos;s bowlers to really stand up and be counted. A good performance here could set up a whole Test career. Tremlett can shake off Gary Naylor&apos;s worries about his pace, Sidebottom can throw off the &apos;journeyman&apos; tag and Anderson can bounce back and keep the ball in line. Then Monty can polish them off second innings to round out a stunning England victory.&quot; 1st over: India 0-0 (Karthik 0, Jaffer 0) &quot;If this pitch is going to produce steepling bounce, why have we not picked Broad instead of Anderson?&quot; asks Richard O&apos;Hagan. &quot;It is going to swing less then one of Freddie&apos;s Sinatra impersonations and we saw at Lord&apos;s that most of the Indian batsmen don&apos;t like playing the rising ball.&quot; Ah, but Sidebottom opens up from the Vauxhall End and there&apos;s a wee bit of inswing to the right-handed Karthik, enough to make him play and miss twice. 2nd over: India 0-0 (Karthik 0, Jaffer 0) &quot;Opening with Anderson rather than Tremlett? Missing a trick there, I think,&quot; ponders one of GU&apos;s more esteemed writers, moments before Anderson nips the ball away from Jaffer&apos;s flashing blade. Two balls later there&apos;s an audible gasp from Prior and the slip cordon, as Jaffer bravely/foolishly leaves a ball that bounces two inches over off stump. A second maiden - England are on the money here. &quot;I live for these days, in an airport lounge in Bangkok on my way to Melbourne via Sydney, with the OBO on my laptop. It&apos;s how me and Smyth hooked up,&quot; writes Sean Boiling, suggesting that that is a good enough reason to live. Come on, it&apos;s what you&apos;re all thinking. 3rd over: India 0-0 (Karthik 0, Jaffer 0) Another probing over from Sidebottom, making Karthik work for his dot balls by arcing the ball back in towards his off stump. India will be happy to play out the first hour here, as batting is only going to get easier as the day progresses. &quot;I think I, as the aforementioned captain in your game of cricket, was full of praise for your on-field performance as tea-watchman,&quot; says Dwight Johnson, who has a history of mendacity. &quot;It was your performance in the &apos;who-has-the-worst-arm-off&apos; that was mocked. Do the OBO-ers now how terrible their correspondent is at throwing?&quot; That is a complete fabrication. I simply misjudged the trajectory of the throw slightly, that&apos;s all. 4th over: India 8-0 (Karthik 0, Jaffer 8) The first runs of the morning - four of them in fact - arrive as Jaffer dispatches a rank Anderson long-hop past point. And then Jaffer prods the ball back past the seamer after he serves up a half-volley on off stump. Tremlett is doing his impression of a windmill as a reminder of his presence to Michael Vaughan. &quot;Re being unfairly maligned for following the captain&apos;s orders, have you received an e-mail from Herschelle Gibbs yet?&quot; asks Gary Naylor. Yes, but I didn&apos;t reprint it because I couldn&apos;t spell his first name. 5th over: India 10-0 (Karthik 2, Jaffer 8) Karthik finally pushes the ball off the square, just, which is enough to bring him two runs. But he&apos;s still struggling to place Sidebottom&apos;s inswing, playing and missing again as the ball flashes by off stump. &quot;Might I ask which cricketer you most resemble?&quot; requests Ben Heywood. &quot;I have, after years of goading, accepted that Paul Collingwood is the man unlucky enough to look a bit like me, although I&apos;m little tubbier around the mid-section and bowl a fair bit quicker than he does. My wild stab in the dark is Matt Prior. Tell me I&apos;m mistaken.&quot; I am repeatedly told by my &quot;friends&quot; (ie people I&apos;ve met on Facebook) that I look a bit like Vaughan, though he lacks the elegance of my batting. That&apos;s certainly an improvement on my previous lookalike: a cross between Glenn Roeder and Mark Lawrenson. 6th over: India 21-0 (Karthik 2, Jaffer 18) &quot;Ironic, isn&apos;t it?&quot; comments Ian Botham, sounding suspiciously like Ms Morrisette. No, Beefy, it&apos;s not ironic that Anderson&apos;s first good ball for two overs went for four, because his poorer deliveries have also been disappearing to the boundary. At least this time his hands went to his head because the ball flew up and over third slip rather than because of his own ineptitude. Oh, actually they now are on his head because of his own ineptitude, after Karthik cuts a short and wide ball square of the wicket for six. &quot;According to TMS you&apos;re not spelling the Indian opener&apos;s name correctly, as he&apos;s now changed it for numerical reasons,&quot; says John Starbuck. Numerical reasons? What on earth does that mean? Why do these Indians keep changing their names? 7th over: India 28-0 (Karthik 5, Jaffer 22) If only there was a pun on Wasim Jaffer&apos;s surname to be made, I would make it with reference to the brilliance of the ball that just beat his outside edge. But Jaffer responds by timing a clip off middle stump perfectly to the midwicket boundary. &quot;Commiserations on your match on Monday. But spare a thought for me. Last week I played a match where the following happened,&quot; begins Chris Goater. &quot;The taxi took me to the wrong ground, in attempting to reach the right one, I climbed through a hole in a fence and planted my foot on a rusty nail. I eventually arrived, late, and dashed onto the field of play. The batsman immediately launched the ball straight at me - I dropped the catch and broke my finger, which bled sporadically for 24 hours and is now in a ridiculous brace for a month. Then, having aggravated a shoulder injury which prevented me from bowling, I was promoted to open the batting. Under gloomy skies, their fast bowler swung it both ways and I was bowled fifth ball for a duck. I am now, much like Ashley Giles, considering retiring from cricket. Can anyone match my cricket bad luck story?&quot; James Anderson is giving it a good go this morning. 8th over: India 29-0 (Karthik 5, Jaffer 22) Seven overs too late, Tremlett is brought into the attack. With his first ball he extracts &quot;spongy bounce&quot; (Shastri) from the pitch, and continues to unsettle Karthik with his bodyline bowling for the next six deliveries (there was a no ball, see). &quot;Bad question Adamson. Expect a flood of emails from my countrymen explaining that the reason is not numerical but numerology. Supposed to bring you luck and all that. An extra vowel here and an extra consonant there and your luck could change drastically and forever. How does Mmiike Adamssonn sound?&quot; observes and asks Ajaaaaaaaaaay Pattta. &quot;So does Karthick get carsick then?&quot; chuckles John Stonestreet, very much to himself. 9th over: India 36-0 (Karthik 5, Jaffer 29) Jaffer is batting beautifully, picking up his boundary for the over with an effortless flick beyond square leg. He now has 29 off 28, and the ball is no longer swinging for Sidebottom as it was now that much of its shine has been lost. On the bright side for England, there&apos;s very little Indian batting to come once these two are removed. &quot;Cricket bad luck story, though I brought it on myself,&quot; says Roger Hadwen. &quot;I was playing a game in Nottingham and didn&apos;t have whites so was wearing a green tracksuit. I was fielding on the square leg boundary and the ball was smacked in my direction. I got underneath it but it came through my hands, hit my head and looped over the boundary for six. As I was staggering around in pain a watching child said: &quot;Oi you, yes you, Robin Hood, you&apos;re ****&quot;. 10th over: India 37-0 (Karthik 6, Jaffer 29) Another tight over from Tremlett, the only run coming as Karthik nervously prods the ball out of Cook&apos;s reach at short leg. It&apos;s only a matter of time before the commentators, who have been praising the bounce Tremlett is getting, start calling for him to pitch it up. &quot;I played cricket on Sunday, against my lads&apos; Under-13s side, and I too scored 19 valuable runs (I finished unbeaten),&quot; says Robert Cookson, showing off. &quot;Then when I bowled I beamed a lad called Hayden - totally accidentally, honest - and then he hit me for 6 a couple of balls later. Sorry again, Hayden.&quot; &quot;And if Karthick gets carsick then does he find it cathartic?&quot; writes Thomas Carver, who should marry John Stonestreet. 11th over: India 37-0 (Karthik 6, Jaffer 29) Having earlier praised Sidebottom for ensuring the Indian openers work for their stay at the crease, the same bowler should now be condemned for allowing Jaffer to leave five successive balls in a row. &quot;Could someone point out the difference between bad luck and incompetence to Roger Hadwen?&quot; requests Robert Jenkins. 12th over: India 44-0 (Karthik 11, Jaffer 30) &quot;HOWZAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?&quot; plead the England team, upsetting Indian numerologists everywhere. But umpire Howell, who finds lifting his finger too much exercise for one morning, shakes his head. It was the right decision - the ball struck Karthik on the knee-roll in line with middle-stump, but the height from which Tremlett was bowling was his undoing. Karthik responds with a textbook cover-drive for four. &quot;Just to let you know, we&apos;re aware of the current r2 tools downness, and the knock-on effect to the r1 tools (error messages, though articles still saving),&quot; writes Anna Pickard. &quot;We&apos;ve let tech know, and we will let you know their progress as soon as we know anything. At all.&quot; Which is my way of apologising for the tardiness of these updates. If, in fact, you&apos;re getting them at all. 13th over: India 48-0 (Karthik 14, Jaffer 31) Uh oh, Anderson&apos;s back. Karthik is quickly richer to the tune of three runs, guiding the ball past mid-on. There&apos;s nothing in this wicket for Anderson. It seems a strange thing to say about an England cricket team after just one hour&apos;s play at The Oval, but it&apos;s time to get Monty on. &quot;There&apos;s more numerology in cricket that people realise. Bob Willis of course is a strong believer in the power of numbers, and changed his name for precisely those reasons,&quot; says Rock Shoddy, who could consider the practice himself. &quot;He was actually christened Boob Willies.&quot; 14th over: India 58-0 (Karthik 24, Jaffer 31) Tremlett almost makes the breakthrough, but Karthik&apos;s thickish outside edge falls short of Bell at third slip and trickles down to the boundary. Then Karthik stands and watches the ball roll to the opposite end of the ground after a somewhat more emphatic clip past mid-on. This is a timely drinks break for England, who need to quickly regroup. &quot;I know an oversized German called Martin &apos;Big Man&apos; Oehmke who was much maligned for following captain&apos;s instructions to the word,&quot; writes Daniel Smith. &quot;He was playing in his first ever cricket match for Wadham College 2nd XI and was wearing a combination of tennis whites and retro German adidas gear. He was told to field at square leg and &apos;stop the ball at all costs&apos;. Being an obedient type, &apos;Big Man&apos; put all of his 6&quot;5&apos; frame behind a rasping pull and stopped the ball&apos;s process with his chest. Needless to say, he writhed around on the floor like a young Jurgen Klinsmann for the next 20 minutes.&quot; WICKET! Jaffer c Pietersen b Anderson 35 (India 62-1) After Jaffer crashes a short, wide Anderson ball to third man, Vaughan puts KP in at short third man. And then Jaffer crashes a short, wide Anderson ball to short third man. Not the wisest of Damien Martyn-esque shots. &quot;Michael, if we&apos;re spending the morning talking about your cricketing highlights, surely now is the time to mention you reverse hooking Essex County Division One&apos;s premier fast bowler?&quot; writes Jon Clements, who knows how to get a mention on OBO. Thank you, Jon, I thought nobody would ever bring it up! &quot;Rumour has it that Richard Whitehall&apos;s nerves are now similar to Harmy&apos;s when given the honour of opening up proceedings on the first day of an Ashes series. My personal highlight is my...&quot; That&apos;ll do, Jon. Thanks. 15th over: India 62-1 (Karthik 24, Dravid 0) The Indian openers have laid the foundation for The Wall. If England can&apos;t knock him over early on, he is a banker to make a century on this pitch and in these circumstances. &quot;Tools reportedly should be FINE now,&quot; claims Anna Pickard, taking away my only valid excuse. 16th over: India 66-1 (Karthik 28, Dravid 0) &quot;I feel the treatment of Anderson by the OBO this morning is reminiscent of the treatment of Joe Cole in an England match (date, venue and opposition escape me),&quot; says James Micklburgh. I think your memory is playing tricks on you, James, but never mind. &quot;Eriksson and McClaren spent the first half screaming at Joe Cole to stay on the wing and stop straying into the centre, only for him to stray into the centre and score what became the winning goal. Suffice to say, messers Eriksson and MaClaren shut up after that.&quot; I would happily silence myself, but my boss might not be too pleased. So I&apos;ll simply relay news that Karthik has just creamed Tremlett back down the ground for the shot of the day. &quot;If Karthick was playing Worcs, do you think he would cart Hick&apos;s gentle offbreaks all round the ground?&quot; chortles Jonathan Wood, who should involve himself in a threesome with Thomas Carver and etc etc. 17th over: India 76-1 (Karthik 28, Dravid 10) Dravid is off the mark with the most dismissive cut shot seen on a cricket pitch since I chopped the ball underneath the wicketkeeper for four on Monday. And then he doubles his score with a replica shot, suggesting Anderson didn&apos;t heed his lesson. Anderson has gone for 37 off six overs. &quot;I know Roger Hadwen very well and I can confirm he is hopeless in the field,&quot; confirms Guy Landon. &quot;Once fielding at silly mid he attempted to field a ball with his foot so he didn&apos;t have to put down his cigarette. The ball rolled up his leg and hit him in the knackers.&quot; 18th over: India 78-1 (Karthik 29, Dravid 11) A couple of singles, the second for Dravid who looks much more assured against Tremlett&apos;s aggressive line (and laughable stare) than either of the openers. &quot;Not an individual experience, but playing for my school Under-11s against Stonyhurst we were dismissed for a paltry 11,&quot; says Gareth Batterbee with misplaced pride. &quot;All the worse for the fact we were the only team that season to get them out for under 100 in their innings and they were bricking it, facing their first loss of the year. Anyone got a team score lower than that? Oh, and I was second-highest scorer with 1.&quot; &quot;If Karthik gets carsick whilst having a cold, would his catarrh sick be cathartic?&quot; You can thank Scott Roberts for that &quot;quip&quot;. 19th over: India 82-1 (Karthik 29, Dravid 15) Another crushing boundary from Dravid, rocking back and cutting Anderson through the covers this time. Immediately the second biggest cheer of the day goes up - second to the wicket - because Monty has been thrown the ball. &quot;Do you think if Karthik were a dodgy street hustler his scam would be the three-card trick?&quot; apologises Tom Ashby. 20th over: India 85-1 (Karthik 32, Dravid 15) No spin for Panesar, but there is the control of line and length that has been missing from Anderson at the other end. &quot;I think my entire indoor cricket team (Jenna Jameson Cricket Club) has had bad luck since our inception,&quot; says Ken Nettleship. You make your own luck in this game, Ken, and if you name the team Jenna Jamerson Cricket Club, your opponents are likely to give you a good going over. &quot;We have had three broken fingers (one during warm up!), one broken nose, one pair of broken glasses, one concussed batsman from running into a fielder, one bruised breast (my wife plays for us!) and a number of swollen testicles when fielding at short leg! So not bad going so far!&quot; 21st over: India 90-1 (Karthik 37, Dravid 15) Karthik plays a standard one-day-open-the-face-of-the-bat-and-guide-the-ball-to-third-man-for-one shot, but England don&apos;t have a third man so it goes for four instead. There has been virtually no applause for any of the boundaries this morning. The England fans are clearly pretty depressed. Or in the bars gearing themselves up for some plastic-glass-snake-building this afternoon. &quot;I remember a primary school match where we got the opposition out for three,&quot; says Alex Ford. &quot;Two of these were wides, and one of our bowlers finished with 5 for 0. Sadly, that wasn&apos;t me and my role was limited to scorer.&quot; Great days, eh, Alex? 22nd over: India 96-1 (Karthik 39, Dravid 18) Ah, Anderson has at last found his niche - charging around the boundary and hurling himself at the ball to brilliantly save two runs. Vaughan should keep him out there for the next over. Or 100. 23rd over: India 103-1 (Karthik 40, Dravid 25) A loud cheer echoes around the ground as news booms out over the tanoy that Sidebottom is to replace Anderson. The move doesn&apos;t halt India&apos;s momentum though, as twice Sidebottom drifts into Dravid&apos;s legs and is made to pay. &quot;On the subject of abject scores, I can beat that,&quot; says Jeff Ando, raising (or maybe lowering) the stakes. &quot;I used to play in the Essex Colts leagues and when Upminster played Cranham (the local village side in every sense, both of which were rivals of the mighty Havering Atte-Bower) Cranham could only field 8 players. In a 20 over game, Upminster fielded first and it only took them 7 overs to bowl them out for 1. And that was an extra! The Romford Recorder has never sounded so patronising in its reports.&quot; As if the Romford Recorder covers cricket. 24th over: India 103-1 (Karthik 40, Dravid 25) A better over that from Panesar, finding some turn, though admittedly it was in Sidebottom&apos;s footmarks outside off stump and moving the ball away from the right-handed Dravid. &quot;if you swap &apos;captain&apos; for &apos;girlfriend&apos;, &apos;cricket ball&apos; for &apos;photoframe&apos;, and &apos;advice&apos; for &apos;screaming rage&apos;,&quot; says Mark Taylor cryptically, &quot;I ignored my captain&apos;s advice this weekend, first dropping an easy catch, then performing a failed Zidane-esque dragdown as the cricket ball smashed into tiny glass shards which have made my foot look like it has measles. Also swap &apos;sent to the boundary to take abuse&apos; with &apos;sent to the kitchen whilst taking abuse&apos; and finish the story yourself.&quot; 25th over: India 109-1 (Karthik 42, Dravid 25) Ok, hopefully the skipper has given one of these two batsmen the order: &quot;OK, you be the lunch watchman, and make sure you do as good a job as that Adamson on Monday&quot;. Now given that Dravid is himself the skipper, it looks like it&apos;s going to be Karthik&apos;s role to sacrifice his wicket. It&apos;s England that are offering the opposition gifts this morning though, with Anderson throwing down four byes that really should have been adjudged wides. &quot;On tour to Barbados our skipper broke his thumb in fielding practice,&quot; says Richard Butler. &quot;He was desperate to play in the Windies though, so he played a game with his thumb in a splint. Trying to take a catch at square-leg with his other hand, he broke his other thumb, and spent the rest of the tour doing an involuntary double thumbs-up to everyone.&quot; 26th over: India 109-1 (Karthik 42, Dravid 25) A rapid maiden from Panesar to Dravid, their second in a row. &quot;I gave Karthick a lift to an exhibition match he was playing in Paris some time ago,&quot; writes Gabriel Munns. Can you see where this is going? &quot;He&apos;d just had an escargots lunch.&quot; Can you?&quot; &quot;It had been poisoned.&quot; No? &quot;Interior of car thick with carsick Karthick&apos;s cathartic garlic arsenic. It&apos;s true.&quot; 27th over: India 116-1 (Karthik 49, Dravid 25) Karthik again steers a widish Sidebottom delivery down to the vacant third-man boundary for four, and then brings himself within one of a half-century by scampering through for three after a push into the covers. &quot;I&apos;m surprised that swollen testicles should be a problem for the Jenna Jameson CC,&quot; says Csaba Abrahall. Indeed, but not bruised breasts. 28th over: India 117-1 (Karthik 50, Dravid 25) Karthik reaches fifty - the sixth successive match in which he has achieved said feat - by working the ball to square leg, and then Dravid blocks out the rest of Panesar&apos;s over. It&apos;s been India&apos;s morning, and it&apos;s probably going to be their afternoon too. Find out with Rob Smyth here in half an hour or so.

Photograph: Hoang Dinh Nam/AFP/Getty Images.Last Thursday evening, I trotted off to the UK&apos;s first night market, an event that promises to take Covent Garden back to its roots as the &quot;larder of London&quot;. I&apos;ve always been excited by night markets, so I had high hopes. There were loads of people milling around a tempting selection of cheeses, olive oils and balsamic vinegars, a hog roast, Cornish oysters, cuts of meat from the Yorkshire moors, cakes, jams, pastries, world-class hand-made fudge (from Burnt Sugar) and ice creams. There were traders from the sublime Neal&apos;s Yard Dairy, Ginger Pig, Duchy Oysters and other fine artisan producers, drawn mostly, it seemed, from Exmouth and Borough markets.  I bought some Tuscan bread, browsed the solitary vegetable stall, and managed to avoid the cake stall, which was generating a fair amount of interest.  I&apos;ll be frequenting the market most Thursdays in August to buy a few choice treats and refill my olive oil bottle from the supplier. However, as pleasant as it is (and fantastic that it&apos;s open till 10pm), overall, I felt somewhat underwhelmed. As I stood in line for an excellent burger with stilton from Northfield Farm, I tried to work out why. And then, in the midst of the politely queuing punters halfway to the burger stall, it came to me. This was a top quality foodie experience, which will appeal to those who have the budget to care about what they put in their bodies (Ginger Pig&apos;s sausage rolls taste great and reflect careful rearing, but at \u00a33 each they don&apos;t make for budget shopping). But it wasn&apos;t the night market I yearned for. It was Borough Market open late, but without the rumble of trains overhead, or the hullabaloo of shouting traders you find at Glasgow&apos;s Barras or Ridley Road in Dalston. It also lacked the cheaper stalls. It was all very civilised, English, middle-class, and ... well, clean.  It dawned on me that I had hotfooted it down there harbouring silly romantic ideas, craving buzz, colour, noise, vibrancy, smells, sizzling woks and steaming pots of rice, mobile stalls with lights and brightly coloured spices piled up against a black night sky - all the vibrant charms of London. I realised that somewhere in my subconscious that with the words night market, I&apos;d - fool that I am - conjured up an image of the night markets and street stalls of Bangkok - chilled Singha beer, sweet and spicy salads on cheap tables lining Thanon Phra Athit, pungent street smells competing with the fragrant scent of tom yum goong, pad thai and bulging prawn dumplings. The uncertainty of buying a concoction I was assured was vegetable to find it delicious in the way that only animal fat is. And, of course, getting the whole experience for \u00a33 a night.  You can&apos;t blame UK traders for the costs of producing organic meat and they deserve our business - especially at the moment. It&apos;s early days for the market and it is, of course, unrealistic to expect the organisers to recreate the exotic and wonderful markets we encounter elsewhere in the world, but I did want some of that atmosphere. Our cities are home to a wealth of diverse cuisine, and it would be fantastic to see it represented alongside our best traditional culinary offerings. It would also be great to see a broader range of traders present, both in terms of the goods they sell and the prices at which they sell them - something that will hopefully happen as the market grows. Personally I&apos;d love to see a seafood stall, more vegetable stalls, noodles, snacks, drinks ... the simple and affordable street fare that turns a farmers&apos; market in the dark into a true Night Market.", "publicationDate": "2007-08-12T15:10:32Z", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Life and style"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2007/aug/12/lastthursdayeveningitrotte", "title": "Eine kleine night market", "sentences": ["I realised that somewhere in my subconscious that with the words night market, I&apos;d - fool that I am - conjured up an image of the night markets and street stalls of Bangkok - chilled Singha beer, sweet and spicy salads on cheap tables lining Thanon Phra Athit, pungent street smells competing with the fragrant scent of tom yum goong, pad thai and bulging prawn dumplings."]}, {"article": "How much do you love your football team? If you are not &apos;lucky&apos; enough to support Manchester United or Chelsea, what would you sacrifice to have a fraction of their success? It is this Faustian dilemma that may have been preoccupying the long-suffering fans of Manchester City since their club was sold to Thaksin Shinawatra, the deposed Prime Minister of Thailand, for \u00a381.6m in early July. Thaksin, who has been compared in his homeland with Hitler, Pol Pot and Aids, has received a wary but convivial reception in the blue half of Manchester. As City began the season against West Ham yesterday with a 2-0 win and with Sven-Goran Eriksson in charge of a scarcely recognisable team of new Spanish, Italian and Brazilian players, there was even guarded talk among the fans of a first trophy for the club in 32 years. Mohamed al Fayed bought Fulham in 1997, but the foreign ownership of Premier League clubs really kicked off when Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea for \u00a3150m in June 2003. Now nine out of 20 clubs in the division are foreign-owned and it is likely that more (perhaps Arsenal or Everton) will be sold during the next year. In some respects, Thaksin, who was overthrown by the Council for National Security (CNS) military junta in a bloodless coup last September, is a natural addition to these ranks. A charismatic individual and natural self-publicist, he is sure to enjoy the prestige of club ownership, a must-have for any self-respecting itinerant billionaire these days. Even with assets of almost \u00a31bn frozen in Thailand, he is said to enjoy a flamboyant lifestyle in England, where he now lives in exile with his wife and three grown-up children. His main residence is a five-bedroom, \u00a34.5m mansion in Weybridge, Surrey, and he also has a serviced apartment in central London, where he answers to &apos;Your Excellency&apos;. He eats at ritzy restaurants such as Royal China and Patara and maintains a &apos;not too short&apos; hairstyle at Toni &amp; Guy. One of his favourite activities is karaoke, which he does with Sarunrat Visutthithada, better known as Lydia, so-called queen of Thai R&amp;B. In other ways, the emergence of Thaksin is an astonishing and, some would say, landmark development. Human-rights organisations are incredulous that he has passed the Premier League&apos;s fit and proper persons test (although the Premier League points out that he has not been convicted of anything) - Thaksin is due in court next week in Bangkok to answer charges of abusing his position to boost his family&apos;s financial interests. To many, the way he has been embraced is evidence that England&apos;s national game has sold its soul. &apos;The Football Association&apos;s failure to investigate properly the background of the foreign nationals buying top clubs or their growing influence on the sport heralds the end of the Premier League as an English institution,&apos; wrote Tom Bower in the August issue of The Observer Sport Monthly However, while there has been some criticism of Thaksin in the press, notably from Manchester City fans such as Simon Hattenstone in the Guardian and Bill Borrows in the September issue of Esquire, there has been nothing approaching the outpouring of anguish and violence that accompanied the sale of Manchester United to Malcolm Glazer in 2005. Borrows may not be renewing his season ticket after more than three decades of loyal support, but the reality is that the majority of the club&apos;s supporters are more sanguine, even adopting a cute nickname for their new owner, &apos;Frank&apos; Shinawatra (it&apos;s pronounced &apos;Chin-a-wat&apos;, but never mind). If the comments on the Manchester Evening News message board are representative, 90 per cent of fans are behind Thaksin and most are more concerned about goalkeeping cover for the new season than the government-endorsed &apos;war on drugs&apos; that saw in excess of 2,275 people killed in Thailand during a three-month period in 2003. &apos;Life being a City fan does not get better than this,&apos; says Stretfordblue; &apos;So far, it&apos;s all a bit of a fairytale,&apos; says another post. A rare dissenting voice comes from someone who signs off as Erik Young, UN Human Rights Ambassador: &apos;Thaksin Shinawatra&apos;s other name is not Frank Sinatra, it is Satan. In fact, Shinawatra was born on 26 July. That was the same day Satan disappeared from Hell. Nostradamus predicted he would appear somewhere around southern China.&apos; In the current climate, though, such criticism receives short shrift. &apos;Billy no mates, do one,&apos; replies the next post. There is something idiosyncratic, almost wilful, about the supporters of Manchester City. The old joke is that City fans come from Manchester and United fans are from Dubai, but it goes deeper than that. &apos;City supporters are perversely loyal,&apos; says Bill Borrows. &apos;One year, after we&apos;d been relegated, the average attendance actually increased. The further we got away from the dishonesty at the top, the more fans were attracted back to the purity of the beautiful game.&apos; Many supporters see themselves as the absolute counterpoint to one of the most successful clubs in the world, just across the city. When Nick Leeson went to prison for losing \u00a3827m, he wore a Manchester City shirt. As he said at the time: &apos;To declare oneself a Blue seemed rather to take the edge off [the crime].&apos; It is not hard to see what attracted Thaksin, a serial entrepreneur before entering politics in the mid-Nineties, to English football. The Premier League is an astute and lucrative investment - as a guideline, Abramovich&apos;s original stake in Chelsea is now worth more than \u00a3500m - and after unsuccessful negotiations for Fulham and Liverpool, the 58-year-old Thai turned his attention to City. The club has the 17th highest income in world football, according to accountancy firm Deloitte, but - all their fans agree - was in a wretched position, stagnant with chronic debt, when he stepped in. A further incentive for Thaksin would have been the profile that his new post would give him. Although the former Prime Minister has announced his retirement from politics, he never says it with much conviction. The CNS claims he is desperate to stay in the spotlight in Thailand, where many worship English football like a second religion. While it is difficult to ascertain Thaksin&apos;s affection for football (officially his game is golf - he is the president of the Thailand PGA), it&apos;s easy to imagine him soaking up the adoration he will receive at the City of Manchester Stadium when United visit next Sunday. He has set out a three-year plan for his new club: a top-10 finish this season, qualification for Europe in the second year and silverware by 2010. It seems reasonable, even sensible, coming from a man whose personal motto is: better to die than live like a loser. &apos;To those people who say that I will not be here for a long time,&apos; Thaksin counters, &apos;I say that I have been joking to my friends that we have a 250-year contract for the stadium and no one should bother negotiating an extension because I will do it in my next life.&apos; Manchester City fans may be reassured by Thaksin&apos;s long-term commitment, but for many others, his involvement fatally compromises the sport and pushes the Premier League ever closer to implosion - the decline of Leeds United magnified on an unprecedented scale. However, there are several inconsistencies with this interpretation, not least Thaksin&apos;s role within it. The fact is that Thaksin&apos;s tenure as Prime Minister of Thailand was one of the most prosperous in the country&apos;s history and he still casts a long shadow over a nation where democracy is yet to be restored. More than 200,000 citizens attend pro-Thaksin rallies and if elections were held today, he would be a strong favourite, courtesy of loyal support from farmers in the north. Despite his absence from the country, the CNS has been unable to entirely tarnish the former leader&apos;s reputation and Tuesday&apos;s court case is primarily procedural, like trying Al Capone for income-tax evasion, you might say. Even the claims from human-rights organisations regarding his violent treatment of drug traffickers have not been officially sanctioned. Thaksin may be controversial, but he is certainly not the only dubious individual running a Premier League club. And, as for football in England, it will continue being in crisis - that is, stratospherically profitable, envied around the globe and featuring many of the world&apos;s finest players in state-of-the-art stadiums. The reality is that the majority of football fans are desperate for the club they love to be bought by an international tycoon with millions to spend on flashy players and facilities. They don&apos;t particularly care where that money comes from and, in a sense, why should they? Everyone else is doing it and, besides, regulation should be the jurisdiction of the FA and the government (a responsibility that both seem keen to duck at the moment). If City win the Manchester derby next weekend, you will certainly hear little criticism of &apos;Frank&apos; from the fans. You can almost hear the singing now: &apos;Regrets? I&apos;ve had a few ...&apos;  The Thaksin lowdown Born 26 July 1949 in Chiang Mai, Thailand, to a wealthy family. After leaving school, Thaksin joined the police before resuming studies in the US. Married Potjaman Damapong in 1980. The couple have three children. Best of times The only elected Prime Minister in Thai history to serve a full term, he was returned with a landslide in 2005. His economic policies (&apos;Thaksinomics&apos;) are credited with drastically reducing poverty in five years. Worst of times While at the UN in New York, he was deposed by a military junta. His assets were frozen and his political party, Thai Rak Thai, was forcibly disbanded. He says he will not return to Thailand until democracy is restored. What he says &apos;I was a democratically elected leader ousted by military coup, so I know the British people, as a mature democracy, understand my position. I am still very popular in Thailand and the military are trying to justify why they have overthrown me.

The London sprinter, who is second in the national rankings this summer but who was not chosen for the world championships in Osaka, had initially triumphed in the event on Saturday in 10.28secs. But officials discovered a malfunction in the timing system and ordered the final to be run again 24 hours later. In pouring rain and in a stadium that was almost empty, the 21-year-old shrugged aside the conditions to burst to victory in an even quicker fashion than the day before, winning in 10.22, ahead of Zhang Peimeng, of China, in 10.30. Ironically, such is the paucity of major contenders for Osaka, Williamson could be the only British athlete to leave the far east this month with a gold medal. Williamson confirmed his position as one of Britain&apos;s fastest men with this win but Mark Lewis-Francis was given the nod for Osaka as much for his relay skills as his chances of making an impression in the individual 100m. Williamson had missed the world championship trials with a chest infection but both his victory times were quicker than Lewis-Francis had run in Manchester and the London grand prix at Crystal Palace when the 3rd position in the 100m team behind Marlon Devonish and Craig Pickering was on offer. Lewis-Francis is fifth in this year&apos;s 100m British list with a best of 10.91 but there was no doubting the manner of Williamson&apos;s recovery from his illness.

The former leader, who was deposed in a bloodless coup last September while abroad, has been living in exile in London and failed to appear before a hearing scheduled to begin today. A nine-judge panel of Thailand&apos;s supreme court ordered the telecoms billionaire and his wife, Pojaman, to be produced before the court at the next hearing set for September 25.  Prosecutors said afterwards that if Mr Thaksin - who recently acquired Manchester City football club for \u00a381.6m - failed to appear by the new deadline then extradition proceedings would be considered. However, an extradition request to British authorities would have virtually no hope of success. British law has no equivalent to that with which Mr Thaksin, 57, is being charged under Thai legislation. The couple are accused of being involved in a \u00a311.1m land deal to buy a prime piece of Bangkok real estate in 2003 while Mr Thaksin was prime minister, in contravention of laws barring serving officials and politicians from engaging in business with state enterprises. In the wake of the coup an &quot;assets examination committee&quot; set up by the military-appointed government investigated the land purchase from an arm of the Bank of Thailand at an auction, during which other bidders dropped out. If convicted Mr Thaksin faces up to 10 years in jail and a fine of \u00a3900. The committee is demanding the purchase be set aside, the land returned and the money confiscated. The former prime minister&apos;s lawyer, Pichit Cheunban, argued that because of the political uncertainty in Thailand it was not safe from his client to return, though his wife has travelled in and out of the country often. The lawyer appealed to the judge that Mr Thaksin&apos;s reappearance in Thailand would merely destabilise the fragile political situation ahead of elections that the coup leaders have promised by December. He added that it would be impossible for Mr Thaksin to receive a fair trial while the junta was still in control and urged that the case be postponed until next year, or until at least a month after the elections. &quot;I have talked with my two clients and we agree that the best timing for them to return to fight the case is after the election,&quot; Mr Pichit said after the ruling. &quot;We reiterate that the current situation is still not good for their safety and we have no desire to see disunity in the country.&quot; In his initial reaction to the Thai court&apos;s decision, Mr Thaksin gave a non-committal response in an email to the Associated Press. &quot;I am aware of the decision in Thailand,&quot; he said in a statement released by a public relations company. &quot;I shall consult with my legal advisers and make an announcement in due course.&quot;  The army chief, Sonthi Boonyaratglin, who led the coup, gave an assurance that Mr Thaksin&apos;s safety would be guaranteed if he returned, directly contradicting an earlier statement that the former prime minister might be at risk from his enemies.  &quot;The [national security council] has to be responsible and the government has to ask the police to take care of it with the military playing a supporting role,&quot; he said. &quot;There should not be any problem for him to return.

We weren&apos;t lying about the jokes.

The former leader, who recently acquired Manchester City football club for \u00a381.6m, was deposed in a bloodless coup in September while he was abroad. He has since been living in exile in London and failed to appear before a hearing scheduled to begin yesterday. The nine-judge panel of Thailand&apos;s supreme court ordered the telecoms billionaire and his wife, Pojaman, to be produced before the court at the next hearing scheduled for September 25. Prosecutors said afterwards that if Mr Thaksin failed to appear by the new deadline then extradition proceedings would be considered. However, an extradition request to British authorities would have virtually no hope of success. British law has no charge equivalent to that which Mr Thaksin, 57, is facing under Thai legislation. Foreign governments are also usually reluctant to extradite former heads of state where there are suspicions of political persecution. The couple are accused of being involved in a \u00a311.1m land deal to buy a prime piece of Bangkok real estate in 2003 while Mr Thaksin was prime minister, in contravention of laws barring serving officials and politicians engaging in business with state enterprises. In the wake of the coup, an &quot;assets examination committee&quot; established by the military-appointed government investigated the purchase of land from an arm of the Bank of Thailand at an auction in which other bidders dropped out. If convicted, Mr Thaksin faces up to 10 years in jail. The committee is demanding the purchase be set aside, the land returned and the money confiscated. The former prime minister&apos;s lawyer, Pichit Cheunban, argued that because of the political uncertainty in Thailand it was not safe for his client to return, though his wife has travelled in and out of the country often and is currently in London. The lawyer argued that Mr Thaksin&apos;s reappearance in Thailand would merely destabilise the fragile political situation ahead of elections that the coup leaders have pledged by December. He added that it would be impossible for Mr Thaksin to receive a fair trial while the junta was still in control and urged that the case be postponed until next year, or until at least a month after the elections. &quot;I have talked with my two clients and we agree that the best timing for them to return to fight the case is after the election,&quot; Mr Pichit said after the ruling. &quot;We reiterate that the current situation is still not good for their safety and we have no desire to see disunity in the country.&quot; In his initial reaction to the Thai court&apos;s decision, Mr Thaksin gave a non-committal response to the Associated Press. &quot;I am aware of the decision in Thailand,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;I shall consult with my legal advisers and make an announcement in due course.&quot; The army chief, Sonthi Boonyaratglin, who led the coup, said Mr Thaksin&apos;s safety would be guaranteed if he returned, directly contradicting an earlier statement that the former premier might be at risk from his enemies. &quot;The [National Security Council] has to be responsible and the government has to ask the police to take care of it with the military playing a supporting role,&quot; he said. &quot;There should not be any problem for him to return. Everything has gone in accordance with the Assets Examination Committee and court process.&quot; Since June, almost \u00a31bn of Mr Thaksin&apos;s assets have been frozen in Thai bank accounts. The tycoon was already a wealthy businessman before he secured two terms in office between 2001 and 2006. But the tax-free sale of his telecoms empire to the Singapore government&apos;s investment arm in 2006 sparked mass street protests that led to his eventual downfall. The Thai military, which justified its takeover on the grounds that Mr Thaksin was corrupt, vilified the former prime minister, but took almost eight months to bring the first charges against him. Backstory Football-mad Thaksin Shinawatra became the first prime minister in Thai history to win two terms of office. The ex-policeman, born in the northern city of Chiang Mai, studied in the US and holds a PhD in criminal justice. On his return in the 1980s, he set up a telecom business and carved out a huge empire, helped by cornering state monopolies. He burst on to the political stage in 1998, using his millions to form the Thai Rak Thai party and in three years he was prime minister, championing Thailand&apos;s rural poor, who still revere him. Before purchasing Manchester City, he failed to win control of Liverpool FC while still prime minister after it emerged that he planned to use state funds to bankroll the deal.", "publicationDate": "2007-08-15T10:23:25Z", "tags": ["World news", "Thailand", "Extradition", "Law", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/15/thailand", "title": "Thaksin a wanted man as Thai court issues arrest warrant for ex-leader", "sentences": ["The couple are accused of being involved in a \u00a311.1m land deal to buy a prime piece of Bangkok real estate in 2003 while Mr Thaksin was prime minister, in contravention of laws barring serving officials and politicians engaging in business with state enterprises."]}, {"article": "1. Know your equipment Solar chargers, water filters, satellite modems, GPS systems, power inverters: these are just some of the unfamiliar items you&apos;ll be packing in your rucksack. Make sure you not only know how they all work but double check they are in full functioning order before you go. You don&apos;t want to be stuck in the middle of the steppe studying a manual wondering how your brand new Garmin eTrex GPS system turns on.  2. Build up a network of contacts Try and build up a network of contacts along your route. That way if you ever find yourself in a sticky spot, or simply in need of good plumbing, you&apos;ve got someone within a 1,000-mile radius you can call upon. British embassies and the British Council are a good place to start. We found ourselves drinking cocktails with the British Council in Russia and doing hula-hoop with the British Ambassador in Kazakhstan.  3. Is it safe to go now?  It is very important to know the current state of affairs in the countries you will be travelling through. Up-to-date information can be found on the internet. We used the regularly updated Foreign and Commonwealth Office website, which enabled us to find out potentially dangerous areas and avoid them. We also backed this up with our own research and contacts we made at embassies along the way, who advised us on any developments. 4. Staying healthy We did a medical training course to brush up on our basic first aid, but luckily never needed to use a rectal Mars Bar. (We were told that, in the case of unconscious diabetics, the US Military recommends using this remedy.) A medical kit is essential and we took a comprehensive tailor-made one from Nomad, which came to good use when Antonia burnt her hand while camping in Russia. Don&apos;t forget to find out if you need jabs or malarial protection. And, if you are on prescription medication, then it is wise to get an explanatory note from your GP.  5. Where are the spark plugs?  Not a question you want to be asking when yours die. If you are overlanding in a vehicle then you need to be au fait with basic mechanical skills and carry plenty of spares. A great book, and our tukking mechanical bible, was the aptly titled Autorepair for Dummies. Punctures can be a real problem, particularly when many of the roads are little more than dirt tracks. We lined all of our tyres with Ultraseal and didn&apos;t suffer a single puncture. And, luckily, we found that good mechanics exist, even in the Kazakh steppe.  6. Lost in translation Look at your route and work out which languages are spoken along the way. If you are going to be in Russian-speaking countries for six weeks then make sure you know at least some basic Russian phrases. At the least, take a good phrasebook and a dictionary. Being able to look up the Russian for chain when yours has given up the ghost could save you a lot of trouble.  7. Stay in touch We had lots of equipment to enable us to stay in touch with people back home while on the road, including a laptop, mobile phone and satellite modem. Just in case you run into any problems, it is a good idea that someone else knows roughly where you are. For example, you can register with the British Embassy when you enter a new country. Also, every evening we would contact our parents in England and tell them our current location and where we expected to be the following day. That way we knew if we drove off a cliff, it wouldn&apos;t take too long to direct help to the right place.  8. It will never happen to me Anything can happen when you are the other side of the world and comprehensive travel insurance is a must before you set off. Policies vary and it is wise to shop around to get one that best suits your adventure. Antonia had a luxury 24-hour stay in a Thai hospital after she came down with a nasty case of pharyngitis and, luckily, the tab was picked up by our insurers. Even if it is not what most of the locals do, try and get insurance for your vehicle in each country. We often picked up insurance at the border and it only cost a few pounds. These policies don&apos;t include free breakdown cover, but it is important to protect yourself, given that some of the local driving skills rival those of a blindfolded ferret.  9. Ask the experts A lot of our most invaluable route-planning tips came from people who had recently completed similar journeys. While no Lonely Planet is going to tell you the state of the M36 in north-west Kazakhstan, someone who drove the same way last year will be able to. For example, when plotting which route we were going to take through Central Asia we consulted the Long Way Round team. If we hadn&apos;t then we would probably still be pushing our tuk tuk Ting Tong out of a pothole somewhere near the Aral Sea. Horizonsunlimited.com is a fantastic way of getting in touch with other overlanders.  10. Don&apos;t forget your sense of humour Overland guru Sam Rutherford of prepare2go.com reminded us of this just before we left. Obvious, yes, but also crucial. Whether dealing with tricky border guards, hatchet-faced hoteliers or surly mechanics, it&apos;s amazing how far a bit of humour and a winning smile can get you.

He also conceded that Andy, the world No16, had put in a terrible performance during his straight-sets defeat against Marcos Baghdatis. Andy has suffered with a wrist injury for much of the summer. It forced him to miss the French Open and Wimbledon but his tentative steps back to action have not been successful and Wednesday&apos;s defeat by Baghdatis made him question whether he would be able to compete in the forthcoming US Open. Jamie, who cruised into the second round of the doubles in Cincinnati last night, said: &quot;He played terrible in his match - I didn&apos;t really want to watch. I&apos;m sure the crowd didn&apos;t want to watch it either, but it&apos;s tough. He&apos;s come back from injury. &quot;I think his wrist is much better but it&apos;s just confidence. Mentally you have to get over that block of &apos;Oh my God, if I hit my forehand, am I going to do my wrist in again&apos;, so maybe that will take a while to get over. But he certainly wasn&apos;t good.&quot; Jamie had no such concerns about his own form. He showed how much he has improved in just a few months as he and Mahesh Bhupathi, the former doubles world No1, overcame Juan Monaco of Argentina and Todd Perry of Australia 7-6, 6-7, 10-3. Murray&apos;s serving was good, his volleying audacious and his serve-returning improved. He also survived three unusual incidents - once when Monaco was able to smash back a Murray smash for a winner, once when a net cord serve from Monaco earned a let by striking Murray on the leg, and once when Bhupathi served an ace only for Perry to dangle the ball before the umpire, claiming it had burst. That point was replayed but this time Bhupathi and Murray lost it and went on to lose that service game too. Though the Indian-Scottish partnership dominated for lengthy periods the contest became much closer than it looked as if it should have been. An awkwardness for Jamie has been that, while partnering Bhupathi, he is required to occupy the right court, which he does not normally do and which he should not need to when he partners Leander Paes, the other former doubles world No1 from India, in Bangkok and Tokyo soon. Nor will that be necessary if he plays with Andy at New Haven next week, something which has not apparently been ruled out. &quot;I haven&apos;t found a partner yet - Tim [Henman] didn&apos;t want to play,&quot; said Jamie. &quot;I guess he doesn&apos;t really want to hang around to play doubles if he doesn&apos;t do so well in the singles, which is fair enough. I don&apos;t know if Andy really wants to play but I still need to find someone.&quot; Andy Roddick was knocked out of the Cincinnati Masters last night, beaten 7-6, 6-4 by the 16th seed, David Ferrer of Spain.The American, the defending champion and third seed, was made to pay for missing three set points in the 10th game of the match before Ferrer took the tiebreak and then broke in the 10th game of the second set to reach the quarter-finals. Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo has pulled out of the US Open later this month.

But most of all, it&apos;s made to keep the little people out. And by &quot;little people&quot;, I mean everyone who isn&apos;t Kate Moss, Anna Wintour, Tom Ford or anyone who has, shamefully, never appeared in those exciting party pictures at the back of Tatler, ideally next to someone with a triple-barrelled surname. But thanks to a level of cunning that would impress Richard Nixon, and an intensity of study that would endow Stephen Hawking with a deep inferiority complex, the Guardian has managed to infiltrate this golden circle and we bring to you, exclusively, your cut-out-and-keep guide to fashion speak. (Incidentally, we wouldn&apos;t advise you actually cutting it out. This is a very nice features section - why would you ruin it? At least wait until the end of the day, when you only need the TV listings. The keeping it part, though, should be taken very, very literally.) Some of you - the more studious, of course - probably already know some of the basics of fashion speak. &quot;Homage&quot; equals &quot;blatantly ripped off copy&quot;; &quot;tricky&quot; equals &quot;unwearable&quot;, and so on. So the Inuits have 72 (or whatever) words for snow? Please. We have 87 just for blue, the light variety (&quot;sky&quot;, &quot;aquamarine&quot;, &quot;pale Yves Klein&quot;, etc). More complex, though, is the fashion speak coined specifically for this season. Up it sprouts like fungi on a seven-month-old bit of emmenthal stuck at the back of the fridge. Where does it come from? Is it toxic to the touch? And will it make me feel sick when it is in my mouth? The answers to all of the above are, respectively, who knows, no but it may be a little furry, and only at first - give it a few minutes and that acidic after-kick is like a party in your mouth and everyone&apos;s invited. &quot;Body con&quot; Clothes that fit tighter than a body wrap. Derives from &quot;body conscious&quot;, and seeing as though eating is almost impossible in this look, you will indeed be very conscious of your body. Of your insides eating themselves in a desperate search for sustenance, that is. See also &quot;tailored&quot; (not baggy), or its antonym &quot;unstructured&quot; (baggy); &quot;strong&quot; (exaggerated shoulders, scary shoes, heavy accessories. Not to be confused with actual human strength that might require physical bulking up. Any increase in size should be done purely sartorially, so, whoa, Nelly, put down that protein shake). &quot;Very Edie&quot; Not Edie Sedgwick (so last season, duh) but Little Edie from the documentary film The Beales of Grey Gardens. Think head scarves, frumpish skirts, slightly skewed makeup. Think, in other words, Alf Garnett&apos;s wife, Else, in Till Death Us Do Part. Think it, but don&apos;t say it. Alternatives for those who don&apos;t fancy looking like an S&amp;M mistress from Torture Garden or a batty prematurely aged housewife are &quot;preppy&quot; (anything with a blazer) or &quot;skater style&quot; (not an encouragement to dress like Christian Slater in the seminal 1989 film Gleaming the Cube, but the more Torvill and Dean-inspired ice-skater look, which should pretty much begin and end with fake fur-lined mid-calf boots, which are not, under pain of death, to be referred to as &quot;booties&quot;. That term should be reserved for slightly kinky, ie totally impossible to walk in, ankle boots). &quot;Nu tec&quot; This can be summed up as &quot;fabrics that look a bit funny&quot;, such as strangely shiny coats and dresses at Lanvin and bobbled fur and leather at Prada. See also &quot;burnt&quot;, &quot;blistered&quot;, &quot;puckered&quot; and &quot;bubbled&quot;, none of which, it has to be said, are adjectives one generally sees in a fashion context, but it&apos;s always nice to give all words their moment in the sun. And also &quot;bleeding&quot;, which refers to colours blending into one another. The more medically slanted &quot;bleeding&quot; is more acceptable than the more common description of &quot;tie-dyed&quot; because hippies are tres passe these days - very 2004/5 as part of the hastily forgotten boho era. &quot;Candyfloss, butter, chocolate, mint&quot; Respectively, pink, yellow, brown and green. As we have already established, colours are most important in fashion speak. But with such a plethora of descriptive terms at one&apos;s disposal - snow-white/ivory/virginal/pearl and so on - knowing which one to use presents a dilemma. Well, after a whole week of flicking through fashion magazines, G2 can exclusively reveal that this season is fixated on culinary references. Not sure what blue is yet, we&apos;ll get back to you on that one. If you&apos;ve made the all too obvious suggestion of blueberry, well, you have clearly failed to grasp a key point of fashion speak. Fashion, so we are often told, usually in justification of featuring a \u00a315,000 crystal dress in a magazine, is all about &quot;aspiration&quot;. So it&apos;s quite right that fashion speak should have a similarly hopeful intention, even if in this case it&apos;s the hypothetical aspiration of the speaker to one day allow herself to eat the cited foodstuff (butter? Chocolate? Dream on, girlfriend), whereas blueberries are totally permissible superfoods and therefore aren&apos;t quite as thrillingly dangerous to mention. But really, who cares about blue anyway? It&apos;s way too flattering for this burnt, blistered, puckered and bubbled season. Instead, going back to Prada, it is all about, as one far inferior newspaper put it with admirable eloquence, &quot;deliberately alienating colours&quot;, which means orange, green and grey, which means &quot;very tricky to wear&quot; Global traveller chic Y&apos;know the expression, so wrong it&apos;s right? Well, that&apos;s pretty much what this term is about. In the very week when gap years are pronounced &quot;out&quot;, fashion has decided that the kind, eclectic, multi-coloured, beach-party-in-Goa tat favoured by gappers the world over is the dernier cri in fashion. Global Traveller Chic is all about trippy colours and the kind of scraps of fabrics from Bangkok night markets that first-year university students think make fabulously chic wall-hangings.

In addition to the camera crews and journalists, clumps of police vehicles are parked up, and small groups of officers are keeping watch over the site - among them a police photographer, who trains a foot-long lens along the tents and marquees on the other side of a low fence. As he snaps away, a wizened-looking climate camper attempts to block his view with a huge white banner. Meanwhile, a group of drummers bash out what may or may not be a samba rhythm - an example, says one protester, of a tried-and-tested technique known as &quot;tactical frivolity&quot;. The camp - located on land that may eventually be cleared for a third Heathrow runway - formally opened on Tuesday, beginning a week of activity that will reach a peak this Sunday with a day of direct action aimed at BAA, the airport&apos;s owners. On the face of it, the campers&apos; point is simple enough: that if we&apos;re serious about scaling down our emissions of greenhouse gases, the people who own and run airports will have to abandon any plans for expansion and drastically scale them down. Friends of the Earth says that Heathrow contributes a third of the UK&apos;s aviation emissions, and flights from the airport pump as much CO2 into the atmosphere as five million cars, every year. (Environmentalists claim Heathrow&apos;s carbon output is 13.9m tonnes; BAA says it is 266,000 tonnes.) But protest is only one part of the exercise. To quote from the pamphlet handed to everyone who turns up, the camp is also meant to be &quot;an amazing living experiment&quot;: a temporary microcosm of the ideal society, brought to a damp field in Middlesex. Look around, and you quickly get the idea. Decisions are taken consensually at daily meetings. Campers can borrow two-wheeled transport from a &quot;bike library&quot;. There are methodically built compost toilets and a recycling system so thorough that it almost beggars belief. And campers can also make the most of scores of workshops, running from the straightforward (&quot;Climate Change For Beginners&quot;) to the arcane (&quot;Social Ecology: the future of anarchism&quot;). The day I arrive, there is a lot of talk about an incident that happened on Tuesday night. At around 7.30pm, the camp&apos;s organisers claim that 25 or so police - members, they say, of a surveillance squad called the Forward Intelligence Team - attempted a &quot;raid&quot;, trying to march into the camp until they were surrounded by campers and non-aggressively &quot;escorted&quot; from the site. While all this went on, several vans of riot police stood watch. At the camp, this short-lived flashpoint seemed to come as a surprise, though it fits neatly with the narrative that has been established in some of the more excitable parts of the media, based around the supposed arrival of &quot;hardcore&quot; elements and Sunday&apos;s day of action that will &quot;paralyse&quot; the airport. To borrow from the Kaiser Chiefs, Sky predicts a riot. With the proviso that the Climate Camp is sworn to non-violence, exactly what will actually happen is unclear. Alex Harvey, a 28 -year-old graduate student who acts as my &quot;escort&quot;, sticks to the camp&apos;s official line, whereby any talk about action on the runways is unequivocally rejected, but there can be no guarantees beyond that. She insists that recent rumours about hoax bomb calls to the airport are false. That said, she claims that the camp is &quot;much more likely&quot; to aim its actions at the nearby offices of BAA, Heathrow&apos;s owners. &quot;We keep saying that,&quot; she says, &quot;and no one&apos;s hearing us.&quot; Twenty-four hours before, I begin my day in very different surroundings, waiting for the bus that runs between Heathrow&apos;s main hotels and its four terminals, and talking to Derek and Anne Hodge. Having flown in yesterday from Sydney and spent the night at one of the airport&apos;s three Holiday Inns, they are en route to Cork, then Southampton, and then for a final fortnight in Spain. They are ex-pats who relocated to Australia 22 years ago; with their golf clubs and pile of upmarket luggage, they have the comfortable air of people whose retirement has turned out very nicely indeed. Before they set off, however, their nerves were jangled by news from the old world. On news bulletins on their adopted country&apos;s Channel 10, they tell me, warnings have recently been sounded about the decline of Britain&apos;s biggest airport, and the camp that has pitched up close by. &quot;The report was on TV the day before we left,&quot; says Anne. &quot;They said Heathrow was the worst airport in the world, and using it was more stressful than a divorce.&quot; And how has it been for them? &quot;It wasn&apos;t bad yesterday,&quot; says her husband. &quot;But it isn&apos;t half grubby. It really does look dirty. If you compare it with other airports - Sydney, say, or Bangkok - it&apos;s really not very good. When you come here, being British by birth, you really do think, &apos;I&apos;d like to be prouder of this.&apos;&quot; And the camp? &quot;Oh, that&apos;s absolutely stupid,&quot; says Anne. &quot;I&apos;ve seen An Inconvenient Truth, but I think the weather&apos;s probably always been cyclical. Then again, when we&apos;ve been getting ready to fly, I suppose I have thought, &apos;Should I do this?&apos; But living in Australia, what can we do?&quot; Her husband emits a muted grumble, tells me his politics place him &quot;to the right of Margaret Thatcher&quot; and suggests that the camp is the stamping ground of &quot;lefty teachers&quot;. Having picked us up from the hotel, the bus wends its way through a crowded landscape, all box-like architecture and towering adverts. According to an incongruous alliance of people who have been recently raising their voices, these 4.6 square miles are now among the most unpleasant places in Britain. The Mayor of London Ken Livingstone recently claimed that Heathrow &quot;shames London&quot; and offers &quot;appalling conditions&quot; in which passengers are effectively kept prisoner in a &quot;ghastly shopping mall&quot;. Sir Terence Conran thinks the airport has become a &quot;really horrible place&quot;. One government minister - Kitty Ussher, who sees to the affairs of the City of London - has talked about the airport&apos;s negative impact on the high-flying international financiers on whom we are so often told our national wellbeing depends: a matter, she says, of problems with security, passport control and a mind-bending layout that amounts to &quot;Heathrow hassle&quot;. The essential problem, according to some people, is the domination of the UK&apos;s airports by BAA - once known as the British Airports Authority, privatised in 1987, now owned by the giant Spanish corporation Ferrovial, and accused of behaving with all the arrogance of the archetypal private monopoly. In March, the Office Of Fair Trading referred BAA to the Competition Commission; as the latter puts its report together, plenty of voices have been claiming that Heathrow should be taken out of BAA&apos;s portfolio. The past few weeks, meanwhile, have seen events - thanks to ubiquitous media coverage, now bundled up into one of the biggest stories of the summer - that have only worsened Heathrow&apos;s troubles. In early August, having got wind of the camp&apos;s imminent arrival, BAA applied for a surreally wide-ranging injunction, focused on banning protest from an area far wider than the airport - including platforms at Paddington Station and certain junctions on the M4 - and preventing organisations including Airport Watch, an umbrella group that includes such well-known revolutionary groups as the Woodland Trust and the RSPB from protesting. Any half-decent PR adviser would surely have predicted the result: BAA received acres of bad press, and the camp was propelled into the national consciousness. And then, the high court granted an altogether more limited injunction than BAA was after, and, with an air of jubilation, the camp&apos;s organisers said that their plans remained unchanged. They pitched up on land that may eventually be concreted over by a runway that would increase the airport&apos;s annual flight numbers from 480,000 to more than 700,000. Largely populated by young enrag\u00e9s, the camp is also buoyed by the quiet support of rather older local people, many of whom have spent decades watching Heathrow eat into the surrounding landscape. These days, they tend to mention one place more than any other: Sipson, the village that a third runway would wipe from the map. Leaving aside the eco-protesters, there are not many lines to be drawn between Heathrow&apos;s local opponents and the politicians and business leaders - and passengers - who bemoan its currently shabby state. After all, the former want any plans for Heathrow&apos;s expansion to be abandoned, while many of the latter think its refurbishment and growth should only be accelerated. Underlying both their arguments, however, is Heathrow&apos;s essential problem. It boils down to this: why is one of the world&apos;s busiest airports and its surrounding netherworld located 15 miles from London, on a site chosen during the second world war, now boxed in by housing, and expanded and altered over 60 years with precious little strategic vision? You only need travel abroad to grasp what&apos;s wrong: while so many of the world&apos;s airports now offer acres of space, futuristic flash and carefully designed passenger comfort, Heathrow has the distinct air of a project made up as people went along. It is, in effect, a very British botch-up. Once I&apos;ve been dropped off at terminal three, my morning-long tour of Heathrow begins in a room known as the &quot;Star Centre&quot;, where banks of plasma screens flash up CCTV pictures of every corner of the airport. This morning, particular attention is being paid to the tunnel that takes 55,000 cars a day between the terminals, and rumours about a possible disruptive action involving a gang of cyclists who are reported to have just set off from London (as it turns out, they don&apos;t show up). In between explaining his job, Greg Ward, Heathrow&apos;s burly operations director, issues the odd dismissive aside about what he calls &quot;Camp Climate&quot;, while a WPC seconded here in case of early trouble from protesters (&quot;I&apos;m not allowed to talk to you,&quot; she says) splits her time between filling in a logbook and reading a paperback novel called Double Jeopardy. Twenty minutes later, I am sitting in a compact corporate meeting room with Mark Bullock, the managing director of BAA&apos;s Heathrow operation, promoted last month to being its public face after the departure of its chief executive Tony Douglas, who was last heard claiming that Heathrow was &quot;bursting at the seams&quot;. The past few months, I suggest, must have been trying, to say the least. &quot;What I know is, I inherited - if I can use that phrase - an airport that&apos;s handling 68 million passengers, and it was designed for 45 million,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;ve got the two busiest runways in the world. So it&apos;s always going to be difficult to manage an operation like that. There are so many external events that can influence the performance of the airport. When you&apos;re operating at capacity, it only takes an incident from the outside - the kind of thing that will force a change in security measures - and the ability of the airport to cope with that is quite stressed.&quot; Bullock says that Heathrow &quot;isn&apos;t fixed, but it&apos;s moving in the right direction&quot;. (At BAA&apos;s HQ, tea is served in &quot;Making Heathrow Great&quot; mugs.) Like many of his colleagues, he claims that queues to pass through security checks now take no longer than 10 minutes - and bemoans the tendency of Heathrow&apos;s detractors to blame problems at check-in, passport control and baggage reclaim on BAA, when they are the chief responsibility of airlines and, in the latter case, the government&apos;s Border and Immigration Agency. When it comes to the camp, he says that he &quot;cannot countenance direct action that would seriously disrupt one and a half million people&quot;. He defends the attempted injunction as an example of BAA doing &quot;everything in its power&quot; to stop just that eventuality. But didn&apos;t its surreally wide terms hand the protesters a PR gift? &quot;The injunction needed to be quite widely worded,&quot; he says, &quot;because these people don&apos;t stand up and say, &apos;I&apos;m one of the people who&apos;s going to take direct action.&apos; You can&apos;t pin them down.&quot; Eventually, we get on to the subject of the third runway. An idea that was first mooted in the 1940s, it was decisively placed on the agenda in late 2003, when the government announced its support for new runways at Heathrow and Stansted (and, just to really inflame environmentalists, Birmingham and Edinburgh). A consultation process will begin next month; a public inquiry is expected to start in 2008. As late as 2001, BAA claimed that it &quot;would urge the government to rule out any additional runway at Heathrow&quot;, though it has now done a volte-face and decided to support the plan, which has only heightened local anger. &quot;It&apos;s very difficult, isn&apos;t it?&quot; says Bullock. &quot;You&apos;ve got to sympathise with people whose homes are in that area, which if it goes ahead, will be under a runway. That&apos;s why the consultation around the third runway needs to balance the social benefits of flying, the economic benefits to London and the UK of this hub airport, the climate impact, and the impact on individuals.&quot; Bullock talks about &quot;balance&quot; a lot, though for the residents of Sipson, there may not be much balance on offer. As and when the third runway is built, their village simply won&apos;t be there any more. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he says, quietly. &quot;That&apos;s where we&apos;d have to build the runway. And that&apos;s why we have noise insulation schemes, schemes to compensate people for the loss of the market value of their houses, a purchase scheme to buy other people&apos;s homes. But I accept ... you know ... We&apos;re never going to make those people happy in that situation. We can&apos;t, can we? It is very difficult for them.&quot; And is it difficult for him, taking those kind of decisions? &quot;As a human being, I feel for them, but you&apos;ve got to look at the greater good of society and balance out the benefits you get for the many, compared with the problems it causes for the few.&quot; Even with three runways, Heathrow could still lag behind many of its international competitors. Despite handling 10 million fewer passengers a year, Paris&apos;s Charles De Gaulle airport has four runways; Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol is 20 million behind, and it has six. In the towns and villages that nudge Heathrow&apos;s perimeter, there are suspicions that once a third runway is built, Heathrow will then expand again. &quot;Personally, I don&apos;t see that,&quot; says Bullock. &quot;And it&apos;s so far in the future that I&apos;ll be long gone by then. That&apos;s ... [pause] ... not something that we&apos;re contemplating.&quot; And if someone points out that BAA said much the same thing about the third runway, what&apos;s his response? Another long pause. &quot;That&apos;s an impossible question to answer, isn&apos;t it? Come back in 50 years&apos; time, and ask me - and who knows? But my answer can only be that there is no need for a fourth runway at Heathrow.&quot; My tour of Heathrow finishes with the building that is BAA&apos;s pride and joy. On the former site of a sewage works, just to the east of the central knot of buildings that contains terminals one, two and three, work is about to finish on terminal five. Designed by Richard Rogers, it will open in March next year to handle all the airport&apos;s British Airways flights, and boost Heathrow&apos;s passenger capacity by up to 25 million, thus relieving a good deal of the pressure that currently burdens the airport. It is a spectacular place, lit up by skylights that form huge arcs, and capped at one end by a vast window that looks out on Heathrow&apos;s runways. Once you have left the arrivals area, you are confronted with a very un-Heathrow sight: an outdoor piazza, replete with lines of trees. &quot;This will be an urban space, completely different from what you&apos;d expect at an airport,&quot; says Mike Forster, Heathrow&apos;s strategy development director, who rhapsodises about the new terminal. &quot;Essentially, it will be a little part of London.&quot; Once the project is completed, work on updating Heathrow will continue: terminals three and four will be refurbished, and terminals one and two will be replaced by a new building, to be called Heathrow East. For some people, unfortunately, the promise of a gleaming future rings rather hollow. Back in the existing terminal three, having flown into Stansted from the Republic of Ireland, 41-year-old Jack Fitzsimons is en route to Mauritius. He has arrived at Heathrow eight hours early. &quot;This place is just chaotic,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s terrible. I used terminal three about a month ago, and it was just overwhelmed. I think of Heathrow as a nuisance airport.&quot; The next morning, I spend a few hours in and around Sipson, the village that nudges the climate camp, where plenty of local people view Heathrow as an increasingly painful headache. Bryan Sobey, the 78-year-old president of the Harlington and Sipson Residents&apos; Association, has been living here since 1951, watching as the airport was transformed from &quot;a few Nissen huts&quot; into the leviathan of today. As we talk, his wife Ann occasionally comes into the front room, carrying bulging lever-arch files that contain two decades&apos; worth of cuttings, correspondence and official documents relating to plans for a third runway. One of the most recent is spread out on the table in front of us: a BAA &quot;Master plan&quot; map, in which the proposed site of the new runway is represented by an anvil-shaped blob, coloured royal blue. Look hard at the map and you can see what are there now: around 700 houses, most of them built in the wake of a guarantee from government in 1953 that even if Heathrow expanded, Sipson would remain untouched. Sobey spent much of his working life as a Heathrow customs officer, and claims to have always been troubled by the ad hoc developments that made Heathrow the higgledy-piggledy place it is today. &quot;They&apos;re all bolt-ons, and none of them work effectively,&quot; he says. &quot;It should never have been designed like it was, but nobody knew what would happen to air travel back then. We&apos;re still stuck with an airport designed in the 1940s that&apos;s been adapted, by piecemeal development, over the years. But that&apos;s what we do in this country: we build piecemeal rubbish.&quot; In nearby Russell Gardens, I meet Christine Taylor, her sister Jane, and mother Sheila, who has spent all of her 75 years in and around Sipson (and never used a plane - &quot;too terrifying&quot;, she says). She does not take much persuasion to map out the lost geography that lies underneath Heathrow&apos;s runways, terminals and surrounding roads. The aforementioned Holiday Inn, she says, was once a set of allotments. Along Bath Road - the unappealing dual carriageway, now lined with hotels, that marks the airport&apos;s northern boundary - there were once neighbourhood shops. She talks about orchards, and the long-lost fruit and vegetable farms that were once the area&apos;s main source of work. Her daughters are among the leading lights of a local campaign group Notrag (the No Third Runway Action Group), and of the opinion that any plan to expand Heathrow would represent &quot;madness&quot;. With the third runway looking ever-more likely, they tell me, families have been moving out of Sipson at speed, selling their homes to buy-to-let landlords who then rent them out to low-paid airport employees. Two years ago, says Jane, 10 Chinese hotel workers were discovered living in a nearby one-bedroom house. Five would sleep during the day, five at night. They were only discovered when all 10 arrived in the house at the same time, and a fight broke out. In Cranford, an array of houses and shops that has the bleak sense of a community locked into a long decline, the story is very similar. Jagraj Sran owns a property business called Heathrow Estates, and has watched a steady exodus over the past two or three years. &quot;A lot of families are leaving,&quot; he says. &quot;With all the talk of a third runway, there is a panic.&quot; Even without the prospect of expansion, you can see why people would want out: at around the forty- fifth second of every minute, a plane streaks overhead, making a noise so loud that any conversation has to stop. On a long residential street called Berkeley Avenue, where the houses&apos; double-glazed windows are 50% funded by BAA, the sound is truly deafening: an immense roar that has been known to shake the tiles from the roofs. Sarupa Soni - who, now aged 68, has lived in her house for 42 years - says she is woken by the planes at five o&apos;clock every morning, and the noise goes on until 11 at night. &quot;It is very, very annoying,&quot; she assures me. &quot;But you have to stop yourself getting bothered by it.&quot; Standing in her back garden as yet another plane comes thundering into land, you can only marvel at her resilience. A mile or so down the road, meanwhile, the Camp For Climate Action&apos;s second afternoon brings a kind of uneasy tedium. While more planes roar by, the police carry on watching and the drums play on. The campers busy themselves with their workshops, while serried camera crews and journalists wait idly by - as in the terminals, engaged in that ubiquitous Heathrow pastime of quietly waiting for something to happen.", "publicationDate": "2007-08-17T15:24:15Z", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Transport", "Environment", "Climate change", "Travel", "Travel and transport", "Heathrow", "UK news", "Heathrow airport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/17/theairlineindustry.transportintheuk", "title": "Heathrow has become Britain's 'nuisance airport'.

I started in Ecuador and worked my way to the bottom of Argentina via Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile. I then travelled back up to Rio de Janeiro. I was away for about six months and travelled independently. I started with a one-month Spanish course in Ecuador, during which I stayed in a hostel, but I&apos;d recommend staying with a local family, otherwise you end up speaking Spanish for four hours a day and English the rest of the time.

My husband was doing some work-related research in Australia. We wanted to hang the trip around that, but also wanted to expose the children to different cultures. The kids would say the highlight was the Galapagos. It was like stepping into a David Attenborough documentary with frigatebirds swooping over our heads to snatch up turtle eggs and sea lions playing with the children in the sea.  For me, though, the highlight was bush camping in the Northern Territory in Australia. We&apos;d never camped properly before, so it was a huge shock. We made friends with another travelling family, and we&apos;d all hike to the creek to wash and swim, and the kids would go charging off to search for cane toads that they could trade for ice creams with the locals.  We nearly didn&apos;t do it because of the hassle of organising camping gear, but it only took one phone call to a crazy fellow in a shed outside Darwin and we had a six-person tent with all the gear and a four-wheel drive within an hour.  We booked most of our South American accommodation in advance using websites such as Trip Advisor. Mostly we stayed in haciendas and cattle ranches, which might have been tricky to organise on the ground. In Australia the best places for families were the tourist parks which have caravan and camping sites as well as cabins.  The children were out of school for three and a half months, but it was a marvellous experience for them.  It was hard at times. We did seem to do a lot more shouting than at home, but we also did a lot more talking. We still have not opened our bank statements.

I found a panda programme in China through a company called i-to-i, spoke to one of the co-ordinators and paid my deposit there and then. My family were shocked, especially as I had never even flown on my own. My daughter told me to go for it. I was assigned to two pandas, Zing Zing and Chu Chu. Work started at 8am when we cleaned the pens and fed the animals. Then we shadowed the vets on their rounds. In the afternoon we did the same. It may sound boring, but no two days were the same.  The reserve was in the foothills of the Qinling Mountains about an hour from Xi&apos;an, and I and the two other volunteers were the only non-Chinese people in the area.

For most of the time I was the only volunteer, but for the last two weeks of my placement I was joined by two 18-year-old girls on their gap year.  I stayed with the headmaster of the school and his two daughters and felt completely accepted into their family. I am considering going back to do another project in India.

Additional information by Benji Lanyado Is volunteering worthwhile? Voluntary Service Overseas has cautioned those who are serious about gap year voluntary work to research carefully before they sign up. &quot;There are many good providers,&quot; says Judith Brodie, director of VSO UK, &quot;but we are concerned about the number of badly planned, spurious schemes that ultimately benefit no one apart from the travel companies that organise them.&quot; So how do you tell a good provider from a bad one? The VSO recommends that gappers ask the following: 1. Will I be given a defined role and purpose? 2. Will I meet face to face with my provider, attend a selection day to assess my suitability for the trip, and gain detailed information on the structure of my placement? 3. Why am I paying for the placement? Where is the money going? 4. Will the work I do be linked to community partnerships that have a lasting impact? How do the volunteers work in partnership with the local community, and does the organisation I am going with have established offices overseas that work in partnership with local people? 5. How will my work be monitored and evaluated so that others can build on what I have done?

The Epic History of the Italians and Their Food by John Dickie  Hodder &amp; Stoughton \u00a320, pp231 For us in the 21st century, Italian food is the cuisine of affluence. As John Dickie, reader in Italian Studies at UCL points out: &apos;Italy has become the model to imitate when it comes to making ingredients, cooking them and eating them.&apos; There are now trattorias for those who can afford them in Bangkok and Beijing . The ingredients most prized by rich gastronomes are Italian - white truffles, Manni olive oil, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, aged balsamic vinegar, Amalfi lemons - as are today&apos;s fashionable foodstuffs, such as buffalo mozzarella, ricotta, polenta ... the list is a long one. Yet we think of most of these as having a peasant provenance. These are among several contradictions presented to the student of the history of Italian eating in Delizia! A serious history of the subject is needed for reasons beyond the current popularity of the cuisine, however; much nonsense is written about the subject, with a lot of dead wood to prune before we can get at the fruit. First, the problem of the meaning of &apos;Italian&apos;. The evidence of American immigrants even in the 20th century was that those from the north of Italy did not even recognise many of the dishes of the south. And vice versa - Neapolitan pizza was thought by the Piedmontese to be dirty, though they only learnt to eat pasta al dente when the practice spread there &apos;from Naples in the early 1800s&apos;. With the exceptions of Romans and Tuscans, the Italian tongue was, for the minority of late-19th-century inhabitants of the peninsula who knew it, &apos;a second language, a written language, a language of public affairs and literature&apos;. Second, there are the myths to be dispelled. Marco Polo did not bring back pasta - &apos;pasta secca was present in Sicily at least a century before Marco Polo was born&apos;. When Catherine de Medici married the future Henry II in 1533, she did not take her cooks with her and teach the French to cook. (The influence has always gone the other way; &apos;in the 18th and 19th centuries, the nobility of southern Italy and Sicily employed a monsu&apos; - a monsieur or French-trained cook.) Medieval cooks did not use spices to disguise flavours, but because they liked heavily spiced foods; spices were expensive and their use ostentatious. Before the voyages of Columbus, there were no tomatoes, chillies, potatoes, beans except for broad beans, pumpkins, courgettes or maize, though maize caught on rapidly. Then there is the idea that Italian food is peasant fare. In fact, Italian food is not only regional but urban, and most great dishes are the product of cities - artichokes and offal belong to Rome, oversized beefsteaks to Florence, pesto to Genoa and so on. The truth about the peasant diet was that it consisted largely of our most fashionable food, polenta, to the extent that many immigrants fetched up at Ellis Island with pellagra, the nasty illness cause by a niacin-deficient diet of nothing but maize porridge. What is there to emulate about Italy, then? Oddly, it&apos;s the Italian resistance to fashion, their food conservatism. It&apos;s true that the reason for the dearth of supermarkets in Italy is political and had to do with keeping the Christian Democrats in office, but it&apos;s taken half a century to sell as much industrially made fresh pasta to Italians as to the rest of us (Luxembourgers eat the most per head). Italy has more EU-protected food products than most EU nations - 155 items - part of what Dickie calls &apos;Europe&apos;s move towards quality produce aimed at elite consumers&apos;. A noble movement has grown up to protect such foods all over the world. It&apos;s called slow food, but it&apos;s led from Italy, by a charismatic old leftie, Carlo Petrini. In the final chapter of his important but slightly under-annotated book, Dickie sees only the hopeful, appealing side of slow food. Thus he misses the internal contradictions of a world movement whose mission is to impose an Italian model on all of us, whose anarcho-syndicalist organisation is led from the top down, and whose &apos;praesidia&apos; (protected foodstuffs) and &apos;convivia&apos; (chapters) use Stalinist language in the service of good taste and good food. And I wish he&apos;d considered the gastronomic puzzle of why Americans use the completely obscure Italian dialect word arugula for rocket (Eruca vesicaria), which has a good English name and has probably grown in Britain since Roman times.", "publicationDate": "2007-08-18T23:06:11Z", "tags": ["House and garden", "Books", "Culture", "Food and drink"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/aug/19/houseandgarden.features", "title": "Review: Delizia! by John Dickie", "sentences": ["As John Dickie, reader in Italian Studies at UCL points out: &apos;Italy has become the model to imitate when it comes to making ingredients, cooking them and eating them.&apos; There are now trattorias for those who can afford them in Bangkok and Beijing ."]}, {"article": "The romantic explorers &apos;We want to celebrate our 50 wedding anniversary&apos; Ruth Abel, 81, and Frank Abel, 73, are retired teachers from Sheffield. They met in Canada when Ruth responded to an advert Frank placed in the Montreal Star asking for a travelling companion The brief:  &apos;We married on Christmas Eve 1958, and to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary did a nostalgic trip across Canada, revisiting all the places we had stopped at on our original trip,&apos; says Frank. &apos;For our 50th next year we need to do something to match that. We love long journeys but have been trying to avoid flying because of the environment. However, I would love to see Japan. We&apos;ve not ruled out cruising, but don&apos;t want to spend ages at sea. We like cities and walking, but Ruth has trouble with her knees if it&apos;s not flat. She&apos;d like to take a balloon ride. We&apos;ve already been to Australia, New Zealand, the US and South Africa, and would like to go for around a month. The budget: \u00a37,000 The solution:  Andy Brabin of Railbookers: &apos;I recommend a rail tour of the Mediterranean, a long trip that keeps their carbon footprint low and encompasses their love of cities. Starting from London, take the Eurostar to Paris, celebrating their anniversary in one of the world&apos;s most romantic cities. Then head south to explore the Cote d&apos;Azur and Monaco. Then head across the Pyrenees to vibrant Barcelona and Madrid, and spend a few days travelling through Spain and Portugal. This itinerary would take approximately 18 days and cost \u00a32900pp including first class rail travel and good quality hotels.&apos; Simon Lloyd of Why Don&apos;t You: &apos;We&apos;d suggest a 10-day Cox and Kings (020 7873 5000; www.coxandkings.co.uk) tour of Japan then a five-day extension to Beijing. You&apos;ll discover modern Tokyo and traditional Kyoto and take trips to the World Heritage site of Nikko, historic Nara, and enjoy an overnight stay in the Hakone National Park beside Mount Fuji. These side trips are by private coach, and walking is minimal. The Beijing tour includes the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square and the Great Wall of China. It would work out at about \u00a33,415pp, staying at a four-star-plus hotel such as the Shangri-La in Beijing, including flights.&apos; Claire Howard-Jones of Ebookers: What better view could there be from a hot air balloon than the glorious Nile and the ancient wonders of Egypt? Visit the Cairo Museum to marvel at the treasures of the ancient pharaohs and the jewel-encrusted mask of Tutankhamen. A trip to Cairo for two weeks in a five-star hotel would cost approximately \u00a34000. If they wanted to extend their trip they could add on an unforgettable seven-night Nile cruise taking in Luxor, Aswan and the Valley of the Kings. The late starters &apos;I&apos;ve conquered my fear for the trip of a lifetime&apos; Gwen Jennings, 51, a policy adviser at the Enviroment Agency, and husband Robert, 53, a minister of religion, live in Torquay and want to fly away together on holiday for the first time next January The brief: &apos;I haven&apos;t flown abroad since 1980, when I was so scared I never flew again,&apos; says Gwen. &apos;I finally conquered my terrors last year and took my first fear-free flight, from Devon to Manchester. Now our sons have grown up we want some &quot;us&quot; time and I&apos;ve saved annual leave for five years so that the whole of January is free. We love the outdoors, walking, old buildings and gardens plus stunning scenery, but don&apos;t want boats, shopping or lying on beaches. We&apos;re curious to see places such as Death Valley or Niagara Falls, or to do experiences such as the Orient Express.&apos; The budget: Around \u00a34,000, flexible. The solution:  Susan Griffith, author of Gap Years For Grown Ups: &apos;Niagara Falls are not at their best in winter and the landscapes of Death Valley are better seen in spring/summer, when the desert is in bloom. I would suggest a self-drive holiday around Southern California. Joshua Tree National Park is a more rewarding desert, with fascinating flora such as the &apos;jumping&apos; cholla cactus, hummingbirds, and weird eroded rock formations. Los Angeles has the 120-acre Huntington Gardens, and coastal Highway 1 between LA and San Francisco is enchanting on a bright winter&apos;s day. Virgin Holidays (0871 222 0306; www.virginholidays.com) can tailormake a three-week Southern California flydrive itinerary with prices from \u00a3600 per person, including flights to LA and car hire.&apos; Simon Lloyd: &apos;Exploring India on the Palace on Wheels (www.palaceonwheels.net) luxury train would be perfect. With 16 period carriages, it features lounges, two restaurant carriages and double and twin-bedded en-suite cabins, all furnished in classic Rajput style, and travels through northwest India&apos;s most spectacular sights. I&apos;d suggest an 11-day itinerary including seven days on the train, plus two nights in Delhi either side, staying at the luxurious Imperial Hotel. The next departure is 7 January and costs from \u00a32,995pp.&apos;  Barry Moxley of Traveltime: &apos;It&apos;s a big first step for someone who&apos;s just conquered her fear of flying, but New Zealand is a trip of a lifetime, with stunning scenery and great weather in January. Collette Worldwide Holidays (0800 804 8705; www.colletteworldwide.com) has a 20-day escorted adventure from \u00a32,769pp. There&apos;s a city tour in Auckland, a visit to the Bay of Islands, historic Waitangi Treaty House, followed by the heartland of Maori civilisation in Rotorua, with a home-cooked meal with a local family. Next it&apos;s on to Wellington, then to South Island, taking the coastal road to Christchurch. Then they board the Tranz Alpine train for the Franz Josef Glacier region, Queenstown, Milford Sound and Mount Cook National Park.&apos; The veteran backpacker &apos;I want to have one more big adventure&apos; Sukie Tomass, 72, ran a vintage clothes store on London&apos;s Kings Road in the Sixties, then practised massage and counselling in Torquay before retiring there The brief: &apos;My friend Gabby and I have been talking about one last big journey next summer while we&apos;re still in good health. I&apos;ve spent a year in India, Nepal and Tibet and a year backpacking through South America. For 20 years I&apos;ve practised a form of massage known as Chua Ka, claiming its heritage from Ghengis Khan&apos;s personal guard, so have a great interest in Mongolia and China. The Big Trip might be the Trans Mongolian/Siberian railway from Beijing to St Petersburg. We&apos;d quite like to see the solar eclipse which will be visible in Central Asia in August next year.&apos; The budget: \u00a33,000 each The solution:  Susan Griffith: &apos;Panoramic Journeys (01608 811183; www.panoramicjourneys.com) offers small group tours to Mongolia that coincide with festivals (Reindeer, Naadam rural games) and involve visiting nomadic families. Next summer they have a two-week itinerary to western Mongolia to include the solar eclipse on 1 August, from \u00a31,595, plus about \u00a3600 for a return flight to Ulaanbaatar on KLM and Mongolian Airways via Moscow. An extension to Beijing brings the cost to \u00a32,395. An alternative would be to volunteer. The New Choice Mongolian Volunteer Organisation in Ulaanbaatar (00 976 1131 4577; www.volunteer.org.mn) arranges short- and long-term placements for volunteers to teach English, renovate buildings, even work in marketing, from \u00a3250 including accommodation with host families.&apos; Barry Moxley from Traveltime: &apos;Explore Worldwide (0870 333 4001; www.explore.co.uk) has the perfect tour to see the eclipse, combined with the new high-altitude Qinghai-Tibet railway. Highlights include Beijing, Lhasa, the world&apos;s highest railway, Xining, Dunhuang&apos;s Buddist shrines and the eclipse in Hami. It leaves on 16 July for 21 nights, including two nights in a tented camp, for \u00a33,049pp including flights.&apos; Simon Lloyd: &apos;The best place to see the solar eclipse will be on the Hexi Corridor, part of the silk route from China to Europe. An eight-night trip operated by Explorers (01276 406877; www.explorers.co.uk/astro/) includes a tour of Shanghai and an internal flight to the desert oasis of Jiuquan. This costs from \u00a31,699pp, including flights and accommodation. There&apos;s an option of a six-night Tibet extension(\u00a3799pp) or a seven-night Yangtze cruise extension (\u00a3869pp).&apos; Andy Brabin: &apos;An InterRail trip around eastern Europe staying in luxury hotels would encompass different cultures and countries as well as beautiful scenery. Take the Eurostar from London to Berlin and then on to Poland to explore Warsaw and Krakow. Hop on the train to Budapest and relax in one of the thermal baths, before a cultural tour of Vienna and a stop-off in Zurich. A 17-night trip would cost around \u00a32900 per person.&apos; The hobby hunters &apos;We want to learn new activities in the sun&apos; Irene Nigol, 61, and husband Timo, 62, have both retired from careers in education. They live in London The brief: &apos;We fancy escaping for a week or so on a beginners&apos; ballroom or Latin dancing holiday in the sun,&apos; says Irene. &apos;We&apos;ve started classes and want to hasten our improvement. We are also gym enthusiasts and enjoy Pilates and yoga, but will give anything a go. We&apos;re quite outdoorsy and would like to do some snorkelling. Timo has just climbed his first Munro and we like walking. We&apos;re free to go anywhere any time from September, so it makes sense to travel off-peak to get value for money.&apos;  The budget: \u00a33,000 The solution:  Susan Griffith: &apos;Tango in Argentina or salsa in Cuba would fit the bill, with watersports or Spanish lessons thrown in. Buenos Aires is awash with the dance, and expert practitioners and amateurs perform in the streets and at milongas (tango dance halls). The website www.tangodata.com.ar lists 22 schools in the city. Caledonia Languages Abroad (01316 217721; www.caledonialanguages.co.uk) offers Spanish lessons and tango courses starting at \u00a3275 a week including B&amp;B. Low-season flights (October/November) to Buenos Aires cost about \u00a3550, so Irene and Timo could live like kings. Caledonia&apos;s holidays in Cuba could include salsa and Spanish classes in Santiago de Cuba, a walk in the Sierra Maestra mountains following Castro&apos;s revolutionary trail and relaxation and snorkelling time. Prices combining homestay accommodation and hotels would be on budget. They might also be attracted to the tango workshops in various countries run by TangoZen (www.tangozen.com).&apos; Adam Hanmer from Gapyearforgrownups.co.uk: &apos;Costa Rica fits the bill. On our &quot;Latin Dance and Spanish&quot; programme, you spend Monday to Thursday mornings learning Spanish at an academy in the capital, San Jose, followed by afternoons of Latin dance in an internationally renowned dance school, learning salsa, cha-cha-cha, cumbia, merengue and bolero with the best local talent and professional Costa Rican instructors. Friday, Saturday and Sundays are free to explore, go white-water rafting, take jungle canopy walks or volcano treks, and go snorkelling in the Pacific and Caribbean. It costs from \u00a3599 for two weeks, or \u00a31,049 for four. Flights from Heathrow would cost around \u00a3600 in low-season.&apos; Simon Lloyd: &apos;If Irene and Timo would like to indulge their sporty side, with lots of opportunities for yoga, Pilates, walking, snorkelling and working out in the Caribbean sunshine, the BodyHoliday at LeSport in St Lucia could be just the ticket. There&apos;s a wide range of classes available each day (everything from archery to scuba diving). Prices for a seven-night stay are from \u00a31,645pp including flights and a daily spa treatment. Alternatively they could brush up their salsa skills on a weekend break in Barcelona. Costing from \u00a3345pp, the weekends include flights, two nights in a three-star hotel, dance classes and a lively social programme including parties and nights out.&apos; The grown-up gapper &apos;I want the gap year I never had&apos; Sue Hewitson, 56, is a teacher from Baildon, West Yorkshire &apos;aching for an adventure&apos; when she retires next summer The brief: &apos;I don&apos;t want to give up on life when I retire! I&apos;m not afraid to go alone as my partner is not in a position to retire with me and does not have the same longing to see places. He is very happy for me to go without him. I want to incorporate a trip around the world with volunteer work in India, Vietnam and South Africa. I want to make my budget last as long as possible.&apos; The budget: \u00a35,000 The solution:  Susan Griffith: &apos;For her chosen destinations, a round-the-world fare is probably not the most suitable. However, through long-haul flight specialist Travel Nation (www.travel-nation.co.uk) she could achieve her wish list for \u00a31,095: Manchester-Johannesburg on Emirates, Jo&apos;burg-Mumbai on South African Airways, Mumbai-Hanoi via Kuala Lumpur on Malaysia Airlines, a short hop to Bangkok and then home. Suggested agencies that match volunteers with grassroots projects in India include Delhi-based iVolunteer (www.ivolunteer.org.in) whose modest arrangement fee is \u00a3250 for up to six months, and living expenses in rural India should not exceed \u00a35 a day. For Vietnam, Bangkok-based Travel-to-Teach (www.travel-to-teach.org) arranges teaching placements plus accommodation costing from \u00a3420 for four weeks to \u00a3980 for 24 weeks. In Cape Town, volunteer placements working with children or animals can be arranged by Aviva (00 27 21 557 4312; www.aviva-sa.com) for about \u00a31,700 for 12 weeks. Sue&apos;s craving for adventure is bound to be appeased.&apos; Simon Lloyd:  &apos;By volunteering with the organisation Global Vision International (www.gvi.co.uk), Sue could join a street children programme in Goa (eight weeks from \u00a31,455, without flights) or volunteer on a Wildlife Research Expedition in South Africa; a five-week project costs around \u00a31,595. Then there are a number of I-to-I (www.i-to-i.com) projects in Vietnam, including community work at a charity cooking house in Ho Chi Minh City, which costs around \u00a31,245 for six weeks. I&apos;d recommend that Sue buys a round-the-world ticket for around \u00a31,200. In total, a 19-week volunteer trip with flights would cost about \u00a35,595 and Sue could stay on longer in these destinations to explore at leisure.&apos; Adam Hanmer: &apos;Volunteering in South Africa with one of our community projects is a brilliant way to see the way of life, with free time to explore. After that, she can spend one to two months getting to know India, doing teaching, child care or working in an orphanage, interspersed with visits to India&apos;s sights. Then she can join our Vietnam Experience programme, which combines sightseeing, volunteering and hill tribe and colonial culture. All this would be with the safety of a group and cost from \u00a34,799 including flights.&apos; The experts Susan Griffith is the author of Gap Years For Grown Ups, published by Crimson Publishing (www.crimsonpublishing.co.uk).

We spent our youth talking about the Vietnam war, watching it on the news, reading about it in the papers, going on anti-war demos - it was a far louder background noise to our lives even than Iraq is today. I knew the names of all the major towns and strategic rivers; I could have drawn you a map of the Ho Chi Minh Trail. But somehow I never pictured them as places, they were just names in the news, and it wasn&apos;t until much later, with films such as Apocalypse Now, that I got some sense of Vietnam&apos;s beauty. Yet the idea of it becoming a tourist destination in my lifetime seemed inconceivable. Of course I was forgetting Vietnam&apos;s incredible resilience and determination. It has long since recovered from the war and is keen now to attract upmarket tourism and to pitch itself as &apos;the new Thailand&apos;. Like Thailand, it has glorious beaches, charming scenery and brilliant food - even better in the street cafes than in the hotel restaurants. It is also cheap. The currency sounds expensive - you ask the price of some tourist tat and reel back in horror when you hear it is 100,000 dong, but then you realise that means under \u00a34 and anyway you are meant to haggle. Actually most tourist places don&apos;t bother with dong, preferring dollars, but I got fond of my dong. I spent one of the most blissful mornings of my life on the South China Sea off Nha Trang, lying on a mattress under a white awning on a creaking fishing boat while the boatmen trailed lines in the water. We were chugging along a white-sand bay and round a headland where I saw a sea eagle almost close enough to touch and heard monkeys in the rainforest above.  Out to sea were all the knobbly islets and rock stacks where the salanganes live - the tiny swifts whose saliva-glued nests are used to make bird&apos;s nest soup. I was hoping I could persuade the boatmen to take me there, but they explained that the nesting sites were under 24-hour guard and no one was allowed near them. Birds&apos; nests are such a valuable export that they are well conserved by the government and only collected once the young have flown. Instead, we went to see a lobster farm, a wonderfully rickety collection of rafts buoyed by oilcans, each with a shack containing whole families and their dogs. The fishermen leave the rafts periodically to go out in coracles to check on their lobster pots, using a paddle like a child&apos;s beach spade, but mainly they just lie around on the rafts with their families. It looks an idyllic life, except possibly for the dogs. All the children laughed their heads off at the sight of me; I don&apos;t know why, but I am always a source of great hilarity in South East Asia.  I was staying at the Evason Hideaway, a spa hotel a few miles down the coast from Nha Trang, and possibly the only hotel that has its own time zone - one hour ahead of the rest of Vietnam. It is at the end of a long isthmus: you reach it by speedboat across the bay and it is so well camouflaged (thatched cabins blending with the foliage just behind the beach) that you can&apos;t see it until you arrive. The great attraction is privacy; the cabins are well spaced out, each with its own garden and pool, which makes them ideal for honeymooners and/or celebs. Prince Andrew came, I was told - but only with his bodyguards, not a girlfriend - and also &apos;lovely&apos; Princess Caroline of Monaco with her less lovely husband Prince Ernst August of Hanover, who demanded that the fridge be filled with Cristal champagne.  Hideaway is one of those &apos;simple&apos;, &apos;eco-friendly&apos; hotels, where you are meant to believe you are living a primitive beachcomber existence while actually having flown zillions of miles to get there. There are bikes outside every cabin so you can cycle to the spa or restaurant, but if, like me, you can&apos;t face that, you ring your personal butler and demand a golf buggy. In short, it&apos;s the sort of hotel I&apos;m sure Gwyneth Paltrow would love and that makes me long to run around shouting, &apos;Hey, couldn&apos;t we build a supercasino here? Let&apos;s ask Sol Kerzner!&apos; But sorry, that&apos;s just sour old me. It is perfect for honeymooners and people who love spa treatments - my travelling companions were going into ecstasies over the Six Senses spa. And if spa treatments pall, Hideaway is only an hour from Nha Trang, a really vibrant town with a staggering 6km public beach where everyone goes in the morning to do their tai chi, and then a beautiful harbour with row after row of blue-and-red fishing boats and lively auctions on the quayside. Nha Trang is the place all the backpackers head for: it looks fun. My one complaint about this coast is that you are advised not to swim for fear of jellyfish. I saw a couple and they were huge Before that, we stayed at another Evason hotel (this one consisting of 1920s colonial villas) in a hill station called Da Lat, which is where the French colonists used to go to escape the summer heat of Saigon. The French called it, optimistically, &apos;Le petit Paris&apos;, but travel writer Norman Lewis, who was never wrong, called it &apos;a drab little resort&apos;. I found it remarkably like Surrey, except that the local drink is artichoke tea. The town boasts a boating lake, a pagoda, a cable car and a miniature Eiffel Tower; but, not content with these excitements, I insisted on being taken to what was billed as a &apos;Variety Creature Strange Unique - Particularly Interesting&apos; in a park out of town. It promised &apos;Pig with Five Feet, Calf with Two Heads, Buffalo Three Horn, Ox&apos;s Six Leg&apos;, all of which I longed to see, assuming they would be safely pickled in glass jars. Horror of horrors, they were alive, in cages, trailing round their extra limbs and heads. I was ashamed of having asked to go there, it was all so sad and squalid, but the local tourists seemed to regard it as a fun day out. Nearby was an embroidery workshop where you could see rows of young women producing exquisitely embroidered pictures of such extreme vulgarity you wanted to cry - all that brilliant craftsmanship devoted to a hideous end result, costing $10,000 and upwards.  The best place we went from Da Lat was a mountain nearby called Lang Bian (2,160m), which you can walk up if you are mad or be driven up in Land Rovers. The drive itself is lovely, through pine forests, but then you come out on top to a fabulous panoramic view of lakes and mountains and the great bowl of Da Lat with its patchwork of market gardens. Again, there are weird tourist attractions - men dressed as cowboys offering pony rides and a larger-than-life statue of Lang and Bian, who were supposedly star-crossed lovers - but, unlike the Variety Creature Strange, I found it entirely charming.  We saw more of the mountains next day when we drove over them to the coast - pine forests at first and then rainforest and glimpses of &apos;minority&apos; villages where the montagnards (mountain people) live and farm. There are more than 50 tribes, each with their own language, and all have portable houses made of wooden planks and screens, which they move every four years or so to farm somewhere else - a habit the government deplores because it wastes so much forest. Some of the houses are very pretty, like Caribbean chattel houses, but with giant TV aerials. The road across the mountains sets off very confidently as a smart new motorway from Da Lat then suddenly expires in a swamp of red mud. Incredibly, our minibus got through, but it was alarming to see the rusting car corpses around and cyclists wading thigh-deep through the mud carrying their bikes over their heads. The rest of the road is good in parts, but the bad parts are absolutely terrifying. Coming down towards the coast you pass through prosperous-looking villages with pot-bellied pigs running about and luscious vegetable plots. Vietnam is great for veg.  On the way back, we spent a night at the Millennium Hilton in Bangkok, which is pure James Bond. It has a rooftop restaurant and an amazing swimming pool on the third floor, which is completely flooded, with all the sun loungers in the water - I worry that the waiters will get trench foot. But I was particularly taken with the &apos;magic&apos; button on the phone that promised to supply your every request, however bizarre. Actually my request was not so bizarre - I wanted a vase for a bouquet of roses I&apos;d been given - but my phone call provoked a lot of puzzled discussion at the other end and the answer: No vase. I&apos;d made the same mistake as I once made in Norwich when I went to a massage parlour in hopes of a massage.  Bangkok is much more fun than Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, which is so heavily polluted by scooter traffic that everyone wears face masks. Maybe it has some louche Graham Greeney charms, but staying just one night meant we never found them. That&apos;s the trouble with Vietnam - it takes so long to get there. You have to fly 12 hours to Bangkok, hang around in the airport, then another hour to Saigon, then take an internal flight - or a long bus journey - to wherever you are going. If there were direct flights to Nha Trang, I&apos;d say go like a shot. As it is, I&apos;d say Vietnam is well worth a visit provided you have plenty of time; but it is madness to go, as I did, for a week.  On the other hand, my boat trip on the South China Sea was one of the most magical days of my life and I can well understand why people fall in love with Vietnam.

The antithesis to Ou&apos;s London life is a property in Bangkok. As creative director of the Thai Silk Company, Ou regularly commutes to Bangkok, where demanding schedules leave him more exhausted than he is from his life in London. Ou was born in Thailand, however, and has created a stress-free zone in his birthplace. His home in Bangkok is on a pocket of land that was bought by his grandparents on their marriage. Ou&apos;s mother now occupies the original house, his niece lives next door, and his uncle is building a home on the other side of the plot. Compared to his home in London, this one is more exotic and colourful. It does not need to be as functional, since Ou does not live there all year round, yet he has created a sense of familiarity by collecting many of his favourite possessions together in the house. For Ou, time at his Bangkok home is all about being close to his family. What he longs for on his return there is the familiar sense of wellbeing that he always feels as soon as he reaches the house. Bangkok&apos;s hectic bustle is shut out by the heavy gates to the compound, behind which he retreats to enjoy precious moments of peace. Within the compound is a pool surrounded by jungle greenery. Here, Ou takes his daily swim, often early in the morning before leaving for work, followed by a massage from his mother&apos;s visiting masseur, during which he catches up on the local gossip and everything else he has missed since his last visit. His favourite moment is when - whatever the weather - he steps into the outdoor shower. Ou&apos;s house was designed by the German architect Stefan Schlau to promote a calm and simple way of life. The ground-floor living and study area has plenty of space to accommodate Ou&apos;s favourite range of furniture, most of which he designed for Gerald Pearce, the owner of the Thai Silk Company. An open-plan bedroom occupies the space above it. By contemporary European standards, the house cost next to nothing to build; the addition of the outdoor swimming pool, which mirrors the dimensions of the house, brought the cost of the property up to \u00a325,000. Inside, Ou has placed a selection of pieces from his travels and the odd heirloom. Buddha statuettes and antique textiles, bought during trips to Myanmar (Burma) and Indonesia, have found a home in the bedroom; the ground-floor room, permeated by the scent of jasmine from the garden, is decorated with some of his grandfather&apos;s sculptures. The intimate family surroundings help Ou to feel grounded during his visits to Bangkok. While he currently lives in England, he acknowledges that he is unlikely to stay there forever. Successive generations of his family have put down roots in Bangkok, so he is reassured that the house, and the sense of belonging somewhere, will always remain.  \u00b7 This is an extract from Vacation Homes by Karen Howes, published by Merrell, priced \u00a329.95.

Williamson is having his hamstring checked by his physiotherapist. It caused him problems last summer but has been OK this. The diagnosis is that he is in good shape. Which makes the fact that he is kicking his heels here while others of lesser pedigree are representing Britain in Japan all the more frustrating. &quot;I think that&apos;s it for the season now,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ll take a month out for an active holiday, cycling probably, and I want to go to Rome.&quot; In Debrecen last month Williamson represented Britain at the European Under-23 Championships. In the final he and his team-mate Craig Pickering had the race to themselves. Pickering has made headlines all year but in Hungary he was second best. &quot;I was really expecting Craig to beat me but he couldn&apos;t go past, not this time. I was excited, not because I couldn&apos;t believe I&apos;d won but I couldn&apos;t believe the time,&quot; Williamson says. He had clocked 10.10sec - 0.04sec behind Marlon Devonish&apos;s best British mark of the season. Williamson&apos;s place in the world championship team could have been settled two weeks later at the trials but he missed them with a chest infection. From the trials Devonish and Pickering were chosen, with the third place left open. Williamson then opted to race in the Universiade - the world student games - in Bangkok rather than the grand prix at Crystal Palace the following Friday. Nobody, he says, told him that he had to run at Crystal Palace to have a chance of selection. By the time he had his first race it was already too late to make the team, the selectors having chosen Mark Lewis-Francis after he ran 10.31sec at Crystal Palace. Williamson, meanwhile, went on to win the Universiade title in belting rain in 10.22sec. He was the only British winner in 18 sports of the Universiade. The selectors could have kept the place open until the August 13 deadline set by the International Association of Athletic Federations and put Williamson on the plane to Macau, which is less than three hours&apos; flying time from Bangkok. &quot;That was what I had hoped they might do,&quot; says Williamson. But there was something all too predictable about Lewis-Francis&apos; selection. In the same way that Pickering has been held up as the future of British sprinting, so Lewis-Francis has been heralded as a man reborn. It seemed like presentation above performance. Even the relay was ruled out for Williamson. &quot;Michael Khmel [Britain&apos;s sprint relay coach] says I don&apos;t have any baton skills and, I don&apos;t know what it is, but I&apos;m not very quick in a rolling start,&quot; he admits. But the first leg does not have a rolling start and baton skills are halved. Alex Nelson was drafted in this week because of injury. Williamson is four metres quicker. Williamson prefers not to dwell on the past. &quot;Next year I want Dwain&apos;s [Chambers] under-23 record of 9.97sec and a place in the Europeans and the world indoors,&quot; he says. &quot;I don&apos;t think as far ahead as London.

During the breathless three weeks after Thaksin&apos;s \u00a321.6m takeover and the appointment of Sven-Goran Eriksson as manager, Anderson was key to sealing the deals for City to sign eight players, all foreign, between the July 13, \u00a38.8m signing of Roland Bianchi from Reggina, and August 3, when Valeri Bojinov joined City from Fiorentina. In an echo of the role played by Pini Zahavi when Chelsea began signing players with Roman Abramovich&apos;s oil millions in 2003, Anderson is said to have been working almost full-time on City&apos;s behalf to help rapidly secure the players to form Eriksson&apos;s new side. Anderson&apos;s involvement with Thaksin began before the City takeover; he was brought in to advise when the former Thai Prime Minister, in exile in London, was first considering buying a football club. In a series of connections which trace the global links of football, business and politics, Anderson&apos;s introduction came from Thaksin&apos;s most important football contact in London, Philippe Huber, a Swiss media entrepreneur. Huber&apos;s company, Kentaro, which has an office in Chelsea Harbour, holds the TV rights for matches played by Thailand&apos;s international team, and Huber is a close friend of the Thai FA&apos;s president, Worawi Makudi, an influential figure in world football and Fifa executive committee member. Through Makudi, Huber came to know Thaksin while he was prime minister, and Huber advised in 2004 when Thaksin tried to buy Liverpool on behalf of the Thai government, a proposal which fell through. When Thaksin stayed in London last year after the Thai military moved against him and deposed him in a bloodless coup, he is understood to have been approached by several English football clubs looking for investment. Although Thaksin and his advisers say he bought City purely because he loves football, not for PR purposes, his acquisition is another textbook lesson in the phenomenal boost football club ownership provides - as it did with Abramovich - to the public standing of controversial figures previously relatively little known outside their home countries. Thaksin had appointed the world&apos;s third largest PR company, Edelman, with a brief to rehabilitate his profile and enable him to return to Thailand as a private citizen, but buying a football club is not understood to have been part of their strategy. Huber and Anderson, advising separately, told Thaksin that City was the best prospect. &quot;People think an operation like this must be very complex,&quot; Huber explains, &quot;but it is not rocket science, really. It was quite easy to come up with Manchester City; it is a huge brand with a lot of potential, and we felt it was a great opportunity. Dr Thaksin was not motivated by PR; he had time and money and he loves football.&quot; Anderson, too, considered City one of the English game&apos;s true sleeping giants, and at \u00a321.6m, plus \u00a317.5m for the loans of the former major shareholders John Wardle and David Makin, very good value. Unlike West Ham, for which the Icelandic buyers paid \u00a385m last December, Spurs, Everton or Liverpool, all clubs sweating on difficult stadium moves or expansions, City came with a new 48,000-seat stadium built by the local council along with their army of desperately loyal fans. Anderson then introduced Thaksin to Keith Harris, the merchant banker whose firm, Seymour Pierce, went on to act for Thaksin on the takeover. Once the deal was done, the speed with which City bought players and replenished the club has astonished football. Anderson&apos;s role in the recruitment of Eriksson became public when Eriksson&apos;s own agent, Athole Still, appeared unaware that discussions were taking place; then on the day Eriksson was unveiled as City&apos;s manager, Anderson publicly discussed the scale of the job required at City. After that, he marshalled his energies and contacts book to help deliver the players. Some observers wondered whether so many new players could gel, and whether City had overpaid, for example paying \u00a38.8m for Bianchi, but Anderson and the club believe they have done excellent business. They have concentrated on foreign players because they believe prices here have become inflated - the strikers Bianchi and Valeri Bojinov combined cost \u00a32m less than the \u00a316.5m Spurs paid Charlton for Darren Bent, and Elano, the midfielder capped 15 times by Brazil, cost \u00a38m, about the same as Aston Villa paid for Nigel Reo-Coker. Nobody at City wanted to discuss the precise role Anderson has played in these signings, and Anderson himself was unavailable. One well-placed source said only: &quot;He will be paid for the unprecedented job he has done.&quot; The other advantage is that City can pay over time. English clubs usually insist that 50% of a transfer be paid immediately, 50% a year later, whereas deals with European clubs can be strung out in three or four instalments over two years or the length of the contract. City have signed a dressing room of talent without Thaksin having to spend enormously up front. For the new owner himself, who has said of his acquisition only that he &quot;dreamed of owning a club for many years,&quot; the outlay has provided transformative PR. Edelman, until their engagement ended in the spring, are understood to have concentrated, via their Brussels and Washington offices, on building political relationships for Thaksin in Europe and the US, and influencing newspapers&apos; comment pages. Yet all their efforts could surely never come close to the impact made by buying City, hiring Sven and winning nine points. Back in Thailand, the supreme court last week issued an arrest warrant against Thaksin and his wife, Potjaman, after they failed to appear to answer charges of criminal corruption relating to a Bangkok land sale. A government-appointed Assets Examination Committee has been picking over the Shinawatra family fortune for almost a year and announced investigations into 12 more instances of alleged corruption, while the government froze $1.5bn of the family&apos;s assets. Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, continues to protest that Thaksin&apos;s 2003 &quot;War on Drugs&quot; involved widespread killings of alleged drug dealers without legal process. Thaksin&apos;s position is that he was a democratically elected and popular prime minister removed by the military, and he rejects all allegations of corruption and human rights violations. Now, though, he need say nothing to fix a benign image in the public mind; he already has iconic status, televised around the world gazing down on his new, attractive team, blue and white scarf round his neck. &quot;The publicity is incomparable,&quot; explains one senior PR source. &quot;In that situation, the public figure does not have to do interviews or face difficult questions. The glamour of football does the talking for him.&quot; One week in, and Thaksin is instantly recognisable - here, across the world where the Premier League rules on TV, and, significantly for him, in Thailand, where millions devour English football. And with his team, facilitated by the seasoned agent Jerome Anderson, having held out for their 1-0 victory against United last Saturday, in the blue half of Manchester Thaksin is a god already. Jerome Anderson: A life in football Jerome Anderson has been best known for years as the agent to a stable of players at Arsenal, from representing the striker Charlie Nicholas in 1984, one of the first clients of his SEM company, to acting for Thierry Henry this summer in his move to Barcelona. Anderson trained in banking, and was well connected at Highbury where he was the stadium announcer, but his and SEM&apos;s reach now extends well beyond north London, into other sports and managing the media career of former playing client Ian Wright. Anderson has long nurtured contacts in Spain, Italy and in eastern European football, an association for which the Brazilian Elano, plucked from Shakhtar Donetsk for a headline \u00a38m, now has reason to be truly grateful. SEM has also established soccer schools in Ghana and Nigeria and, the company says, a &quot;world class scouting team throughout the African continent, to search for and unearth the next Roger Milla, Michael Essien or Samuel Eto&apos;o&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2007-08-22T08:38:12Z", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2007/aug/21/agentandersonthemanbehind", "title": "Agent Anderson the man behind City revolution", "sentences": ["Back in Thailand, the supreme court last week issued an arrest warrant against Thaksin and his wife, Potjaman, after they failed to appear to answer charges of criminal corruption relating to a Bangkok land sale."]}, {"article": "Now, here&apos;s a cultural success story of truly epic proportions. The Edinburgh Festival Fringe alone has sold 1.7m tickets this year - that&apos;s more than twice the number sold by the Manchester Commonwealth Games. It does this every year. And the official Edinburgh International Festival hasn&apos;t even finished yet, so its figures are still to come. The Edinburgh Book Festival has attracted 200,000 to its Charlotte Square tent city, which means that the Edinburgh culture-fest&apos;s final score will be well over 2 million. The Adelaide arts festival, Edinburgh&apos;s nearest rival, shifts only 250,000. This is an astonishing achievement and gives the lie to those who claim that people aren&apos;t interested in drama, literature, music and physical theatre anymore. And it isn&apos;t all comedy, by any means. Less than a quarter of the Fringe shows are standups, and the quality of the theatre is higher than it has any right to be. There are lemons of course, among the 2,050 separate productions across 250 venues, but plays like Truth in Translation, The Container, Damascus, Long Time Dead, Ravenhill for Breakfast, Art of Laughter, even Tony! The Blair Musical stand comparison with anything you are likely to see anywhere else this year. And the point of it is that these &quot;cultural Olympics&quot; as the first minister, Alex Salmond, calls them, happen largely spontaneously and with very little public funding. There is no overall curator of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and its subsidy from Edinburgh council is worth less than the Lord Provost&apos;s car. There are large venues, of course, like the Assembly Rooms, Underbelly and Gilded Balloon, but these are under no overall artistic or financial direction. The Edinburgh festival is demand-led; it is the public themselves who decide what is good and what is bad by voting with their tickets. Milton Friedman would have been proud of them, because on the whole they tend to get it right. With a few exceptions - like the over-hyped Spanish outfit Fuerzabruta who have reinvented Pink Floyd stadium events; or the Lady Boys of Bangkok, who are becoming as much a part of festival tapestry as the Tattoo. But these are essentially sideshows. So, hurrah for the free market. Except, as we know, the market never works in a vacuum - it requires political and economic infrastructure if it is not to collapse under the weight of its own dynamism. Edinburgh&apos;s population doubles in August as every corner of habitable space is rented-out at inflated rates. It is becoming more and more expensive to &quot;do&quot; Edinburgh with ticket prices rising. It is also getting older. Younger people simply can&apos;t afford the cost of coming to Edinburgh, where you can get through a thousand pounds in a matter of days. And this is serious. No one wants the festival to become a kind of Saga vision of Glastonbury. One solution might be to integrate Edinburgh into the UK music festival circuit by allocating free space in the city for camping, and by selling flat-rate omnibus tickets at a discount. There are other hardware issues. Venues are often appalling, with poor seating, restricted views, bad ventilation ... this may have a certain underground appeal for guerrilla theatre but a grown-up festival needs grown up facilities. Someone needs to sort out the marketing of the festivals and dress the city properly so that people realise that they are participating in the greatest cultural event on the planet. And publicists have a job to do reminding the rest of the UK about what is going on here, because in London you would hardly know that Edinburgh is happening at all. The coverage is fitful in the press and largely non-existent on broadcast, at least by comparison with the coverage of the Glastonbury music festival. Yet, for public service broadcasters like the BBC trying to justify the licence fee, Edinburgh should be a great opportunity to show that it can promote high cultural standards even as it remains popular. I can&apos;t understand why it doesn&apos;t devote a channel to the Edinburgh Festival in August. It&apos;s not as if there is anything much else going on. The wealth of material here, from Macbeth on stilts (don&apos;t laugh, it was really rather good) to Ricky Gervais (boo) on the Edinburgh Castle is crying out for the kind of broadcasting effort the BBC routinely puts into the Proms. I&apos;m sure Edinburgh will survive, for these are problems of success rather than failure. But that success needs recognition and the involvement of the great cultural institutions. The new nationalist government in Edinburgh has seen the light and is promising to invest in Edinburgh&apos;s festivals in order to use them as an international showcase for a new Scotland. The previous Labour regime was too poisoned by its own philistinism to realise the enormous potential of this unique event. But it shouldn&apos;t be left to the SNP to take culture seriously - this is, or should be, a British achievement.

Williamson, Britain&apos;s European Under-23 100m champion, faces an anxious wait until 2010 knowing one more missed test in that time could ruin his dream of competing in the Olympic Games in London. Williamson, 21, was not selected for Britain&apos;s team for these world championships even though he was the second-fastest sprinter in the country behind Marlon Devonish. He beat Craig Pickering to the European Under-23 title in Debrecen, Hungary, in July and then won gold at the World Student Games in Bangkok. Williamson missed his first test in 2005 and his second last year. He will have to wait five years until they are expunged from his record but a third missed test in that time would mean him being banned for one year and barred from the Olympics. At least three other British athletes are one missed test away from the suspension which befell Ohuruogu, below, who missed three. Becky Lyne, the European 800m bronze medallist, is one and she revealed she puts notes everywhere to remind her a third cannot be missed. Like Ohuruogu, Williamson is coached by Lloyd Cowan and divides his time between training at the Lee Valley Athletics Centre and attending university nearby. It is understood that he missed his second test when he was at university. Ohuruogu said yesterday that her gold medal win had been soured by the negative reaction that greeted her win, having returned to the sport following her 12...#8209;month suspension. She was in tears yesterday after being asked whether she had ever taken drugs, by Nicky Campbell on BBC Radio Five Live&apos;s Breakfast show. She replied: &quot;No, of course not.&quot; She said later: &quot;The way I see it is that I&apos;m damned if I do and damned if I don&apos;t. If I hadn&apos;t run well, it would have been &apos;why did you bring her out?&apos; But then you run well and you get scepticism thrown in your face. It&apos;s made me a bit sour. It annoys me that a lot of people pick and choose who they want to slam down and who they want to raise up. &quot;I do not understand what benchmark they are using. The reaction was mixed and I was very upset and disappointed. It was expected and I would be stupid if I thought it wasn&apos;t. I have had to deal with it over the last year and I managed to see it only as distraction, so to be honest it will not bother me again.&quot; However, her mood may have been brightened by a message from Simon Clegg, the chief executive of the British Olympic Association. Ohuruogu is waiting on an appeal to the BOA, which rarely allows athletes who have committed a doping offence to compete in the Games. UK Athletics&apos; announcement yesterday that Clegg sent a message of congratulations to Ohuruogu, and Nicola Sanders, the silver medallist from the race, lifted the spirits of the champion. &quot;Anything from the BOA is encouraging,&quot; Ohuruogu said. Clegg later insisted the text was sent to Dave Collins, UK Athletics&apos; national performance director. Clegg said: &quot;The BOA is delighted for athletics and I have congratulated Dave Collins on reaching his target of three medals at the world championships in Osaka. I also asked him to pass on my congratulations to the medallists.&quot; He added: &quot;At the end of July the BOA received Ohuruogu&apos;s appeal. An appeals panel with an independent chair - appointed by the Sports Dispute Resolution Panel - will conduct the proceedings of the appeal.&quot; The decision is expected around the end of October. Ohuruogu may run in the heats of the 400m relay tomorrow but she is more likely to be saved for the final on Sunday, along with Sanders, in an event where Britain have an outstanding chance of gold. She will race in Zurich next Friday, though, where she will meet Sanya Richards, the American who is unbeaten in the Golden League over the distance but who failed to make the 400m team here. Richards, who runs in today&apos;s 200m final, said: &quot;She [Ohuruogu] never tested positive for a banned substance and I know it can be tough to do that location form. But we all have to do it. She deserved to be punished but now she is back and hopefully she will not have any more interruptions. Christine is a real champion. I will get my revenge in Zurich.&quot; Sanders revealed how she had to wait at the Nagai Stadium until 4am after the final because the urine samples she was producing for her drugs test were too weak. She was not allowed back to her hotel until 8am and then had to provide two more samples.", "publicationDate": "2007-08-30T23:09:20Z", "tags": ["Athletics", "Sport", "Drugs in sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/aug/31/athletics.sport1", "title": "Athletics: Ohuruogu training partner is one missed test from ban", "sentences": ["He beat Craig Pickering to the European Under-23 title in Debrecen, Hungary, in July and then won gold at the World Student Games in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Up to 100 office buildings in London are to get energy-efficient improvements under a scheme launched today by the city&apos;s mayor. Ken Livingstone invited energy companies to submit bids for an initial contract, worth up to \u00a310m, to cut power consumption in the buildings. Transport for London&apos;s headquarters will be among the first buildings to get an energy-efficiency upgrade under the scheme, which will include Greater London Authority Group offices and operational centres.  The GLAG includes the Metropolitan police authority, the London Fire and Emergency Planning authority and the London Development Agency, and runs a total of 900 buildings. Those buildings alone could save up to 50,000 tonnes of carbon emissions each year, and more than \u00a31m through lower energy bills. London is the first to take action of the 16 cities, including New York, Tokyo and Bangkok, that earlier this year signed up to the Clinton Climate Initiative to cut emissions by making buildings more energy efficient. The contract is seen as the start of a process that will allow all public sector buildings to get an energy upgrade. The GLAG will also work to involve the private sector.  London&apos;s office buildings produce around 15m tonnes of CO2 per year and account for 33% of total emissions for the capital. The companies bidding for the contract will need to provide a range of services including surveying and auditing the buildings to assess the most appropriate energy-efficiency measures. Mr Livingstone said: &quot;London is leading the way by becoming the first of the 16 cities signed up to the C40/Clinton Initiative programme to begin work to cut climate change emissions by making our buildings more energy-efficient.&quot; The programme, developed at the New York Large Cities Summit in May, brought together four of the world&apos;s largest energy service companies, five of the world&apos;s largest banks and 16 of the world&apos;s largest cities.  It offers building owners an energy audit and recommendations on a full range of measures to reduce energy use, a discounted offer of goods and services guaranteed to deliver the identified reductions, and an optional financing element to pay for works. The contract notice is being advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union and should be awarded early next year.  The mayor&apos;s office is hoping for interest from UK and international supply companies and facilities management companies.  A spokeswoman for the mayor&apos;s office said: &quot;Our aim is to stimulate the market and enable local businesses to be involved in delivering the services.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-08-31T16:59:45Z", "tags": ["Climate change", "Business", "London politics", "Environment", "London"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/aug/31/climatechange.londonmayor", "title": "London to get green makeover", "sentences": ["London is the first to take action of the 16 cities, including New York, Tokyo and Bangkok, that earlier this year signed up to the Clinton Climate Initiative to cut emissions by making buildings more energy efficient."]}, {"article": "Read this Or give it to the colleague who&apos;s always talking about jacking it in to go travelling.

The earlier warrant had been issued over an alleged conflict of interest in the sale of property in Bangkok. Mr Thaksin has been living abroad since a bloodless military coup almost a year ago - he was out of the country at the time. The removal followed mass demonstrations demanding his resignation over alleged corruption and abuse of power. Mr Thaksin has been living in the UK and now owns the Manchester City football club. Sunai Manomaiudom, the director general of Thailand&apos;s department of special investigation - its equivalent of the FBI - said his agency had sought the warrant. The new criminal warrants for Mr Thaksin and his wife, Pojamarn, involve charges of violating regulations requiring disclosure of corporate information to the stock exchange. The case stems from accusations that Mr Thaksin and his wife held shares in overseas funds that were hidden from financial regulators in Thailand and the US. Pichit Chuenban, a lawyer for Mr Thaksin&apos;s family, said he would tell his client of the court action and advise him not to return to fight the case for now &quot;because the situation in the country is not normal&quot;. &quot;We think he should return only after we have an elected government,&quot; Mr Pichit told the Associated Press. Thailand is ostensibly being run by an interim civilian government but a military council intensely hostile to Mr Thaksin has the ultimate say. Mr Thaksin, a billionaire in telecommunications before entering politics, was elected as prime minister in 2001.

Somebody at VfL Wolfsburg must have read their findings: new manager Felix Magath was allowed to bring in no less than 15 new players at a net cost of roughly \u008015m in the summer. Some of them have very nice names, like Grafite, the Brazilian striker from Le Mans or Mame Cheikh Niang, who used to play for Moroka Swallows in Johannesburg, and some of them are actually quite good, like Sergiu Radu and Vlad Munteanu, the two Romanians from Cottbus. But somehow, the Morgan Stanley formula is not quite working in Lower Saxony. After losing 2-1 away to surprisingly decent Hertha, Wolves are licking their wounds in 14th place, a less than spectacular improvement on last season, which they finished in 15th. Magath was unwilling to discuss his transfer policy after the defeat and decided to come up with a very original excuse instead. He blamed Hertha&apos;s sponsor Deutsche Bahn (German Railways) for his team&apos;s insipid performance in the first half. Wolfsburg, you see, had taken the train to Berlin but a few delays had made it a tiresome three-hour trip rather than the usual 60-minute short hop. &quot;I must congratulate Deutsche Bahn,&quot; Magath said. But could two extra hours&apos; journey time on a Friday afternoon have quite such a dramatic effect a day later? Needless to say, it&apos;s a dubious line of thought and one that derails rather quickly - unlike the usually excellent and reliably Germanic Deutsche Bahn trains, of course. But blaming the opposition sponsors is still a very novel genre and one that could yet be developed further by other managers. Cottbus boss Petrik Sander, for example, would have been perfectly within his rights to complain about the confusing &quot;Mister Lady Jeans&quot; logo on N\u00fcrnberg&apos;s shirts after their 1-1 draw. They might be fine for a Scissor Sisters gig or Bangkok&apos;s red light district, but you just don&apos;t expect so much polysexual ambiguity in the Stadion der Freundschaft. Schalke could easily allege that Leverkusen&apos;s parent company Bayer delivered the wrong kind of drug to their medical department before their thrilling 1-1 on Friday night, and 3-2 losers Bochum might perhaps have argued that Tui, the travel company adorning the Hannover shirts, had sent them to 18-30 hell rather than La Manga in pre-season. If there is indeed a difference between the two. Stuttgart manager Armin Veh, alas, had to think about a different kind of explanation after his men went down 1-0 in Karlsruhe, of all places. The Swabian champions share the same sponsor with their hated rivals from Baden, a local energy company. Bundesliga regulations stipulated that the game had to take place in the first third of the season to avoid possible collusion, but there was never a chance of that: few German derbies are as vitriolic and spiteful. The rivalry has all sorts of political, economic and cultural overtones and essentially goes back to the aftermath of the second world war, when the two regions in the south-west became one federal state of the new republic, very much against their will. Swabians have traditionally looked down on their less wealthy neighbours and they insult them as &quot;Gelbf\u00fc\u00dfler&quot; (yellow feet), a strange term that probably alludes to the fact that poor Badeners had to walk without shoes. Arrogant Swabians are in return dismissed as &quot;Sp\u00e4tzlefresser&quot;, noodle-eaters. Stuttgart got the better part of the post-war deal, though: the city emerged as an industrial powerhouse whereas Karlsruhe had to make do with getting the federal court. The football fortunes of those two have by and large followed a similar pattern: Stuttgart won titles and built a big expensive stadium that staged matches in two World Cups while KSC still play in the old crumbling Wildparkstadion. Their last competive meeting was in 1998, when Karlsruhe got relegated, so KSC fans were looking for &quot;90 minutes to make us forget nine years&quot;, as one banner proclaimed. Karlsruhe defender Maik Franz predicted &quot;a war&quot;, but 500 policemen ensured that it remained relatively peaceful in the stand. Down on the grass, Ede Becker&apos;s side did not disappoint. They hassled and harangued their technically more gifted visitors and hit them on the counter-attack: Tamas Hajnal scored the winning goal, Stuttgart&apos;s reply was half-hearted and they wasted their few good chances. Sporting director Horst Heldt had seen &quot;over-elaborate football&quot; of the sort that doesn&apos;t win too many games. After four matches, the champions still only have four points, making for a worrying balance sheet before the start of the Champions League. At the other end of the table, Bochum, Bielefeld and Frankfurt all lost while Bayern dropped their first points of the season at Hamburg. Their 1-1 draw brought a mundane performance from Ribery and co, the scruffiest of equalisers and was more noticeable for a series of petty fouls and minor misdemeanours that went mostly unpunished. Ex-Spurs defender Timoth\u00e9e Atouba, for example, tried to give Hamit Altintop a new haircut and Bastian Schweinsteiger was guilty of a gross &quot;Schweinerei&quot; (disgrace), according to Bild, when he lashed out at Jerome Boateng and was lucky not to connect. A much more savoury sight was Bremen&apos;s Diego demonstrating the Brazilian definition of a back-pass. But we must leave you with another gem from Tomislav &quot;Pipi&quot; Piplica. The Cottbus keeper ran through the box like &quot;a ballet dancer out of control&quot; (S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung), completely missed the ball and ended up mounting his team-mate Igor Mitreski before Nicky Adler scored what would have been N\u00fcrnberg&apos;s winning goal three minutes from time. But referee Knut Kircher disallowed it, having somehow seen a foul on the keeper beforehand. &quot;We are not in England,&quot; Kircher said. That&apos;s true. But with men like Piplica in goal, it&apos;s easy to get confused.

While reminiscing about the trip, he made an interesting point. Are there any real &quot;fly by the seat of your pants&quot; adventures left in travel?  Undoubtedly the original Top Deck Tours helped to lay the foundations for the adventure travel we see today. But have we ended up sanitising what was exciting, unpredictable and occasionally risky travel? In 1975, the first London to Kathmandu tour arrived &quot;several weeks late&quot;. It would be great to think that a modern tour company could get away with arriving March or April - &quot;we&apos;ll see how it goes&quot;.  Over the past 30 years, travel has certainly changed.

Praise the Lord, then, for the &quot;chads&quot;; the &quot;charity adventurers&quot; who are putting that frisson of unpredictability back into independent travel.  A chad is essentially someone who invents their own unique trip or challenge to raise money for a charity, using PR to publicise their chosen cause. They are modern-day adventurers who take on exciting (and often dangerous) trips for the benefit of others. It heartened Steve to hear there were still a few people willing to go the extra mile, thrill seekers on unique adventures for good causes.  Here are just a few of the best.

Jody Aggett, 30, was arrested along with his pregnant Thai girlfriend, Ramphia Lo, in 2001, and charged with manufacturing and possessing narcotics. He had met Ms Lo while backpacking and had been intending to bring her back to the UK before she gave birth. But by the time they arrived in Bangkok, she was eight months pregnant and could not travel, so they stayed rent-free in a flat above a travel agency in return for opening and closing the shop each day. They did not know that the agency&apos;s owner - a dual Canadian and Dutch citizen known as Adrian - had been using the building to make ecstasy. The couple were arrested alongside Adrian and his Thai girlfriend when police raided the building in November 2001. After being ordered to sign what Mr Aggett&apos;s family say amounted to a false confession - which had not been translated from Thai - Mr Aggett was found guilty of being part of the plot. He and Ms Lo were sentenced to death, although the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 2003. Their son, Ryan, was born behind bars, but now lives with Mr Aggett&apos;s parents, Lorna and Tony, in Swindon. Mr Aggett lodged an appeal against the conviction with the Thai supreme court, claiming an unfair trial and insufficient evidence. But political upheavals in the country, including a military coup last year, delayed his hearing. Yesterday, the British embassy in Bangkok confirmed that Mr Aggett had been acquitted after an appeal to the supreme court. Catherine Wolthuizen, the chief executive of Fair Trials Abroad, which campaigned for Mr Aggett&apos;s release, said prison had begun to take its toll on him. &quot;He was finding it difficult, especially the last year because of the delays in the case coming to court and things being thrown into turmoil by the political situation in Thailand,&quot; she said. &quot;The appeal had been set for last September but it was put off indefinitely, which made him feel quite despondent. &quot;Physically, he&apos;s generally been in reasonably good health, although Thai prison conditions are hard.&quot; She said that although Mr Aggett had been sentenced despite there being &quot;absolutely no evidence&quot; against him, his supporters never doubted that he would be freed. &quot;The only evidence was from an unnamed police source so it was always our belief that he would be acquitted on appeal,&quot; she said. Ms Wolthuizen said Mr Aggett&apos;s parents and Ryan, who is now five, were &quot;ecstatic&quot; at the news, adding: &quot;They&apos;ve already started planning the party to celebrate him coming home.&quot; A Foreign Office spokeswoman said Mr Aggett had been freed from jail but was still in custody awaiting full release. She added that Ms Lo had also been freed. &quot;The supreme court did not uphold the criminal and appeal court&apos;s life sentence and that is the reason for his release,&quot; she said. &quot;We have provided consular assistance the whole time and we are very pleased that he has been released.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-09-04T23:10:04Z", "tags": ["UK news", "World news", "Thailand", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/sep/05/thailand", "title": "Briton freed from Thai prison after court overturns drug conviction", "sentences": ["But by the time they arrived in Bangkok, she was eight months pregnant and could not travel, so they stayed rent-free in a flat above a travel agency in return for opening and closing the shop each day.", "Yesterday, the British embassy in Bangkok confirmed that Mr Aggett had been acquitted after an appeal to the supreme court."]}, {"article": "The increased ease of travel and communication over the last few decades has meant that we are more open to the oddities of different cultures. Garlic was considered pretty outre in the home counties 50 years ago; now we plunder the cuisines and wardrobes and libraries of the world for our amusement. If something really doesn&apos;t appeal in the midst of this orgy of cultural globalisation, our reaction tends to be one of Voltaire-like equanimity: not to my taste, old chap, but different strokes for different folks. So when two goats were sacrificed in Nepal on Sunday, it wasn&apos;t really anybody else&apos;s business. Sentimental occidentals might feel a bit sorry for the goats, but the overall feeling would probably be: hey, that&apos;s the way they do things out there. Except that the reason the goats were sacrificed was very specific. One of the Boeing 757s operated by Nepal Airlines was suffering from a mechanical fault, so the decision was taken to offer the goats to placate the sky god Akash Bhairab. The goats were killed in front of the malfunctioning aircraft, and now everything is reported to be back to normal. That&apos;s a bit different, isn&apos;t it? Would you still be happy to fly on one of those planes if safety checks were left to the caprices of sky gods rather than trained technicians? How far does your faith in cultural relativism really extend? You make the same choice every time you decide whether to take a motorcycle taxi through the Bangkok rush hour, knowing that your driver&apos;s equanimity probably derives from the protective amulet he&apos;s tucked under his foreskin. But apart from the superstitious practices, these responses to danger often have a lot to do with the Vedic traditions of Buddhism and Hinduism, which take a more fatalistic view of life and death. And the news that Mattel has recalled yet another batch of Chinese-made toys on safety grounds raises the same issues. If we choose to get involved in a globalised economy, we&apos;re going to have to accept that some cultures might have a different, more laid-back attitude to risk. Effectively, the west is welcoming the likes of Nepal Airlines into its cultural and economic airspace.

What happens when a school really lets its pupils down: when the walls collapse sideways and the heavy tiled roof pancakes down in a couple of seconds? These questions are not hypothetical. On October 8 2005, some 10,000 schools in Pakistan were hit by a severe earthquake. Around 17,000 children died. In Aceh, Sumatra, the tsunami of December 26, 2004 destroyed 420 schools, killed 1,000 teachers and may have killed more than 70,000 children. Schools collapsed and children died when a severe earthquake shook Izmit in Turkey in 1999. Earthquakes don&apos;t kill, buildings do. Buildings can be constructed in ways that should withstand even quite severe shocks. But, according to Chandra Bhakuni, a young structural engineer now working in Britain who has just launched an online earthquake risk calculator, all too often they are not. He worked in Gujarat for three years after the earthquake of January 2001 in which 20,000 people died. Luckily, it was national republic day - a holiday for most - but even so 1,000 schoolchildren were reported dead. He got involved in the reconstruction projects: he looked at risk and hazard in places like Himachal Pradesh and the Andaman Islands, and, he tells me, the reason the children died in India was because the schools were irresponsibly designed and badly constructed. Schoolchildren probably died in Turkey, Iran and Pakistan for much the same reasons. None of these deaths was inevitable and it might not have cost very much more to have made the schools a lot safer when they were first built. The challenge of safety in public buildings isn&apos;t simple - the effects of earthquake are capricious, and the levels of loss vary according to the bedrock, the season and time of day - and systematic research into school safety is a relatively recent thing. But the topic has now gone planet-wide. Academics have launched a global coalition for school safety. The UN has an international strategy for disaster reduction and its secretariat has taken up the theme. Unesco offices in Bangkok and Djakarta have produced an educational game called Disaster Master. There are several challenges: one is to educate children about earthquakes and other natural hazards, and - through them - perhaps educate the parents. If kids know what to do during an earthquake then lives will be saved. If parents become aware that their children are at risk, maybe they will put pressure on the schools, and perhaps, too, they themselves will start to take disaster prevention seriously. The other big push is to make sure the school buildings can survive a severe shock. &quot;It&apos;s still a mish-mash,&quot; Chandra Bhakuni tells me. &quot;To add to the confusion, sometimes unintentional bad design and construction elements of a building actually help it withstand the damage. It is also important to recognise that, in an earthquake, not all the buildings fall, therefore not all of them will kill.&quot; He produces some hypothetical calculations to make his point. In any earthquake, anywhere, it is the worst five per cent of the buildings that collapse into rubble and cause more than 75% - maybe 95% - of the deaths. So the trick would be to start by identifying the most dangerous 5%, or perhaps at least the most vulnerable 20%. &quot;I personally believe that the first step should be to make the buildings safe so that the softer measures such as drills and education can be fully utilised. However, again, we don&apos;t know which buildings may fall and which may not.&quot; Earthquakes are only part of the story. There are natural hazards everywhere: from tropical storm, flood, wildfire, volcanic eruption, avalanche, mudslide, and so on. There are more potential victims than ever: a global population increase of more than 80 million people a year amplifies the chances that the next big disaster will be even worse than the previous one, simply because each year brings more potential victims. More and more people have moved into the cities, and many of these are at risk because they have crowded into shantytowns, on unstable hillsides or in the flood zones. Swiftly-growing cities like Tokyo, Mumbai, Shanghai, Jakarta and Dhaka are simultaneously vulnerable to earthquake, cyclone, tsunami and storm surge. So the dangers are growing, and they could multiply even further because it seems fairly clear that the frequency of some climate related natural hazards is increasing, thanks to global warming. Anyone worried about how to save lives, protect incomes and relieve poverty might think it a good idea to start with education. But that, of course, also means making sure that the schools are safe places for the kids even before the lessons begin. This is not simply a problem for the poorer regions of the planet: schoolchildren are also at risk from earthquakes in New Zealand, California and Japan; schools are as likely to catch fire in Greece or Portugal as they are in Nigeria. And Britons who were around in the sixties will remember with sadness that landslides are a hazard even in those countries that don&apos;t have mountains. Who could forget the disaster at Aberfan in which more than 140 people died, including 116 schoolchildren?", "publicationDate": "2007-09-05T22:49:04Z", "tags": ["Higher education", "Education", "Schools", "UK news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/sep/05/highereducation.schools", "title": "Tim Radford on earthquake prevention for school buildings", "sentences": ["Unesco offices in Bangkok and Djakarta have produced an educational game called Disaster Master."]}, {"article": "Western Australia You could do the classic Sydney-to-Brisbane route in two weeks, but far more unusual and adventurous is a west-coast jaunt from Perth to Broome. The rugged landscapes, dazzling water and idyllic lagoons mean the miles pay dividends. Use Greyhound (greyhound.com.au) buses if you&apos;re on a budget or, for more freedom, hire a car.  Spend a relaxing day exploring Perth&apos;s Kings Park and Art Gallery (artgallery.wa.gov.au), then take a ferry to the lively port of Fremantle for the afternoon from the Barrack St Jetty. Start your adventure in style at the Eight Nicholson hotel (00 618 9382 1881; 8nicholson.com.au&quot;, rooms from \u00a390) [all prices are for a double room unless otherwise stated] in Subiaco, the city&apos;s &apos;it&apos; zone on the western side.  Head north to Cervantes to see the Pinnacles rock formations at Nambung National Park, then to Geraldton, the last big town on the route. From here, take a flight over the sprawling, uninhabited coral outcrops of the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, from around $130 per person per hour with Geraldton Air Charter (00 618 9923 3434; geraldtonaircharter.com.au).

Onward to Coral Bay for snorkelling amid the colourful fish of the Ningaloo Reef - the Bayview Coral Bay (00 618 9385 6655; coralbaywa.com) has dorms (\u00a38 for a bed), cabins and rooms - and Exmouth for whale-watching. The Ningaloo Club (00 618 9948 5100; ningalooclub.com; \u00a310) has safari tents, pool, beach access and free bikes.  Next, head into the rocky red landscapes of the Pilbara. It takes a day to reach Port Hedland. Check out Karinji National Park, 250km south of Port Hedland, where deep gorges create a playground of rock pools and waterfalls. From here push through to Broome. The eight-hour drive will be forgotten when you see the vivid town, with its red cliffs, white sand beaches, turquoise waters and green mangroves. The historical sites will keep you busy and the Temple Tree B&amp;B (00 618 9193 5728; broometempletree.com.au; \u00a350) is worth booking ahead for its yummy breakfast under the frangipani tree. All that&apos;s left is to fly back to Perth for the long trip home.  \u00b7 Return flights from London to Perth, including internal flight from Broome, cost from \u00a3846 with STA Travel (0871 230 0040; statravel.co.uk), flying with Royal Brunei and Qantas. Vietnam to Laos Travelling from Hanoi in Vietnam south to Vientiane in Laos, you&apos;ll explore charming towns, jaw-dropping mountain regions and tranquil rivers, eating fantastic food and meeting warm people as you go. Arranging transport is easy enough - either hire a private minivan or taxi for each leg, or rely on the bus service. Hanoi is a hectic, charming city that retains a sense of history. Lose yourself in the Old Quarter markets and art galleries; see Ho Chi Minh&apos;s Mausoleum and the temples. Try the fantastically gaudy pagoda-style Dragon Hotel (00 84 48 292954; dragonhotelvn.com; \u00a320), devoutly Chinese in character with a fish pool.

It covers a small distance, so there are no long slogs, and buses run several times a day between the destinations.  Fly into Managua, Nicaragua&apos;s sprawling lakeside capital. Its setting - surrounded by extinct volcanoes and crater lakes - will set the tone for adventure. Check out the Museo Sitio las Huellas de Acahualinca (for its 6,000-year-old footprints), the Museo Nacional and the Catedral Nueva, and shop for handicrafts at the Roberto Huembes market. Managua is the best place to splash out on a decent hotel; book ahead for the Hotel Los Robles (00 505 267 3008; hotellosrobles.com; \u00a350) a colonial villa with antique furniture and a tropical garden.

The Hotel Volcan Masaya (00 505 522 7114; \u00a320) has air con and great views. By bus, travel to Granada, a beautiful city of colourful colonial homes on Lake Nicaragua. Spend a few days here, kayaking on the lake to the 354 basalt islands called Las Isletas, which are covered with mango trees and birds, but consider also a day out to the sleeping Volcan Mombacho, where you can hike through cloud forest and coffee plantations. Drag yourself away to Rivas, a bus ride south on the isthmus that separates Lake Nicaragua from the Pacific. The two conical mountains on Isla de Ometepe are evidence of the volcanic activity that created the connection between North and South America. The Hotel Cacique Nicarao (00 505 045 3234; \u00a315) is friendly, with decent grub.

If there&apos;s time, stop at San Juan del Sur, a small fishing town on a sweeping bay - try the lovely wooden Villa Colonial hotel (00 505 568 2539; \u00a310). Finally, head down to Penas Blancas to cross the border into Costa Rica. You can take a bus straight to San Jose in four hours, or head to the Parque Nacional Santa Rosa, a stretch of tropical rain forest and the surf mecca of Central America. You&apos;ll have to kip outside the park in the Hacienda Los Inocentes (00 506 679 9190; losinocenteslodge.com; \u00a320) - a cattle ranch-turned-ecolodge. San Jose is a five-hour bus ride away, and though it&apos;s not a great-looking city, it&apos;s cosmopolitan and loves to party. Wander along the Avenida Central, people-watch in the parks then join the josefinos to drink and dance the night away. Try the Mexico Bar, next to the Barrio Mexico church on Calle 16 in Central San Jose - it&apos;s upscale and popular with locals, and you may catch some live mariachi music. The Hotel Milvia (00 506 225 4543; novanet.co.cr/milvia; \u00a335) is a Caribbean-style, 1930s plantation house hotel, with Costa Rican art on the walls.  \u00b7 STA Travel (0871 230 8512; statravel.co.uk) has flights from London into Managua, out of San Jose, via Madrid from \u00a3698 on Iberia.

A few days in Spain makes a relaxing start. Get a cheap flight to Malaga, a city with leafy boulevards, beaches and a great Picasso Museum (00 34 952 602731; museopicassomalaga.org). Sweat out your work stress in the Banos Arabes (00 34 952 212327; elhammam.com) hammam, before a night of tapas in the bars between the Calle Carreteria and the Plaza de la Merced.

Take a bus to Tarifa for a laidback day or two on the white sandy beach. Funky Moroccan-style bars are more prevalent here than in Morocco: try Souk (00 34 956 620708), and stay at La Sacrista (00 34 956 681759; lasacristia.net), a refurbished 17th-century inn with doubles from \u00a365 a night.  After a 35-minute crossing from Tarifa the ferry (0871 222 3312; directferries.co.uk) dumps you in the hectic port of Tangier. Explore the thrilling medina, try a pastilla (pigeon in pastry) in the garden at Raihani, 10 Rue Ahmed Chaoki, and stay at the luxurious El Minzah Hotel (00 212 39 935885; elminzah.com; \u00a375). Next, take a bus or taxi to Chefchaouen, a magical village in the Rif mountains with a maze of pretty pale blue buildings, hippyish cafes and markets.

Then it&apos;s another bus to the village of Tanaghmeilt to visit the Cascades d&apos;Ouzoud in the Atlas mountains, offering an enticing glimpse of Berber life. Locals are very friendly, often inviting visitors to drink and drum with them at the top of the falls under the stars. Riad Cascades d&apos;Ouzoud (00 212 23 429173; \u00a350) has gorgeous doubles with lanterns and rugs. Hop on another bus to Asni, where you can hike the rugged path up Mount Toubkal.

Egypt to Syria 5Cairo will blow your mind, and if you&apos;re willing to let it blow your budget too, stay in the opulent Oberoi Mena House (00 202 33 773222; oberoimenahouse.com; \u00a3150) on the doorstep of the pyramids at Giza. Then head to the Sinai Peninsula. There are buses, but it&apos;s a 470km trip to Sharm El Sheikh, and for around \u00a350 you can fly with Egypt Air (0207 734 2343; egyptair.com).  Sharm is great for diving and snorkelling; Na&apos;ama Bay has a lovely beach, and you can take a day trip to St Catherine&apos;s National Park to see the religious buildings with Mount Sinai towering above. The Iberotel Lido (00 20 69 360 2603; www.iberotel-eg. com; \u00a360 half-board) has a rooftop pool.  To travellers&apos; favourite Dahab next (by bus), for beach cafes and bazaars. Stay in the Bedouin village Assalah. The Nesima (00 20 69 364 0320; nesima-resort.com; \u00a340) has dome-shaped bedrooms and a palm-fringed pool. Take a bus to Nuweiba to catch a boat to Aqaba in Jordan. Aqaba is backed by rugged golden mountains and desert, with palm-lined beaches, forts and the ruins of the ancient Islamic city of Ayla. It&apos;s a good base for exploring the dunes of Wadi Rum and Petra, so book a few nights at the Al-Zatari Hotel (00 962 32 022970; \u00a315).  Take a four-hour bus trip to Amman, where you should focus on museums, wine bars and mosques and not expect mystical souks. The smart Bellevue Hotel (00 962 6461 6144; bellevue.com.jo; \u00a380) has a sauna and ice-cream shop.

But Nam is having none of it. She is marching straight into the bush, with no regard for my command.  I&apos;ve signed up for a mahout course, and spent the morning trying to get my elephant driving skills right. But something seems to be lost in translation. Nam has spotted some succulent branches, and does not care that the more spiky ones are hitting my face as she tramples forth. I hang on to her ears for dear life.  For several days, I have been enjoying the cultural sights of Luang Prabang, the former royal capital of Laos. The south-east Asian nation is fast becoming a popular destination with travellers, and Luang Prabang is the highlight. It&apos;s a beautiful town on the Mekong river, mixing Buddhist temples with French colonial mansions in a mountainous jungle landscape. Despite decades of war and 30 years of communist rationalisation, Luang Prabang has managed to keep alive its historical identity and its tradition as a Buddhist spiritual centre.  But after several days of sightseeing, it&apos;s time to get more active. In just two days, I can learn how to ride an elephant. While a number of travel companies offer elephant rides in the vicinity of town, there&apos;s only one that teaches you the secrets of being a mahout. I sign up.  The elephant camp is just a few miles outside town, yet we&apos;re deep into the jungle. The location - on the Nam Khan river, a Mekong tributary - is stunning, surrounded by high jagged mountains.  I&apos;ve been assigned Nam. Or maybe it&apos;s me who&apos;s been assigned to her. She is a 46-year-old female elephant who used to work in the logging industry, bringing down trees. In elephant years, she is a grand old lady and has retired. Nam - one of five elephants in the camp - is a beautiful beast, and for the next two days we will eat, bathe and go for rides together. If I manage to climb on top of her.  Mahouts scale these animals as if they were mere donkeys. By contrast, it takes me several ungraceful tries, and in the end, a good push on the bum to climb Nam. I&apos;m only three metres off the ground, but I feel dizzy. The guide down there looks so tiny. I&apos;ve been on a horse before, but this is different. On an elephant, you actually sit on its head, and there is neither saddle nor reins. To get a stable position, I have to learn how to squeeze my knees together behind her ears. At first, I desperately grab her ears for stability. It takes a while to get confident enough to let go.  I have also tried to learn the commands, but in my slightly panicked state they are difficult to remember. I&apos;ve learnt that &apos;pai&apos; is &apos;forward&apos;, &apos;ho&apos; means &apos;stop&apos; and &apos;map&apos; is an order to sit. &apos;Quoa&apos; is supposed to make her go right, and then there&apos;s &apos;sai&apos; which the instructor insists means &apos;left&apos;, but I clearly haven&apos;t got the authority to pull it off yet.  Nam knows the way anyway; she has been doing this several times a day for a long time. After some more training and practice, we finally seem to understand each other. The &apos;hos&apos; and &apos;maps&apos; seem to work better, or maybe she is just humouring me. At least she doesn&apos;t rush off for food all the time. I even manage to look at my jungle surroundings and appreciate their beauty.  We round the day off by taking the elephants to a clearing in the forest, where they will stay for the night. Our instructors tie one ankle of each animal with a long iron chain twisted around a tree. If you want to keep elephants, building fences is pointless. They will trample them in seconds.  We stay over at the elephant camp, in a nice lodge on the other side of the river. I hook up with three other mahout wannabes on the terrace. We exchange tips and stories from our long and extensive experience with the elephants - all six hours of it. As the sun and the compulsory Beer Lao go down, the stories get better.  After breakfast the next morning, we take Nam and the other elephants down to the river bank for their morning bath. A small crowd has assembled. It&apos;s the camp&apos;s other lodgers, who have got up to watch the elephant bathing, and the mahout class is the morning attraction. I barely manage to maintain my jungle cred as I hang on for dear life.  But this is fantastic fun. We&apos;re in the river, splashing about. It&apos;s a big commotion - the elephants are quite playful, using their trunks to hose us down. We&apos;ve been given brushes, and I&apos;m scrubbing Nam as hard as I can. Her skin is extremely tough and coarse, so it&apos;s hard work scraping off all the dirt. Our last job as mahouts is to feed the animals. Nam has been eating away in the jungle all morning, of course, but there&apos;s still plenty of room for bananas and sugar cane. She gobbles up one bunch of bananas after another, and I&apos;m amazed how fast and precise her trunk is.  Eventually, it&apos;s time to say goodbye. My &apos;sai&apos; and &apos;pai&apos; were coming on nicely, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be quitting the day job just yet. \u00b7 A two-day mahout course costs $119 (\u00a360) per person.

A raucous chorus of courting frogs reverberated from the inky blackness as we studied the food stalls. Fried black beetles and roachy bugs sat in glistening, crispy piles alongside more appetising looking freshwater shrimps. We mused on the reasons why we eat crustaceans but not insects, deciding it was largely because all the filthy things that prawns do in the sea are out of sight and out of mind. Early next morning we boarded an &apos;express&apos; boat for the seven-hour journey to Siem Reap, home to the temples of Angkor. En route small boats paddled out to add local passengers to our payload. Two guys running late attempted to scramble into a slim vessel to come and meet us. Then our wake hit them. In tragi-comedic slow motion their rocking canoe filled with water and capsized, dumping the poor prospective passengers unceremoniously in the drink. Lurching on with a pronounced starboard tilt, our vessel rolled violently as the captain threw it into unfeasibly sharp turns on the winding, narrow watercourse. Pondering our lack of stability, I mentally prepared an &apos;abandon ship&apos; plan. We were now travelling through extensive fields of marijuana plants 10 feet tall - not the worst place to be shipwrecked, I thought. The muddy channel reminded me strangely of the Norfolk Broads, though weed, not reed, was the riverbank crop of choice. There was also a merciful absence of pleasure boats crewed by drunken stag parties playing &apos;chicken&apos; and crashing into each other. The final leg of the journey took us into Tonle Sap, Asia&apos;s largest lake. Reaching 13,000 square kilometres in size during the rainy season, it was huge, empty and rather lonely. Suddenly our elderly, listing boat felt somewhat vulnerable. A passing tour boat of neatly seated, life-jacketed Japanese made our rag-tag bunch of lolling safety-oblivious westerners look like the epitome of nautical fecklessness. Two days of tramping round temples later we were on the notorious, bum-breaking &apos;disco bus&apos; from Siem Reap to the Thai border. According to slow travel conspiracy theorists, the appalling state of this road is attributable to a covert deal between a certain airline and the Cambodian government not to resurface the highway - thereby securing business from more anally sensitive passengers for the trip between Bangkok and Siem Reap. Allegedly. The road did not live up to its reputation. It was rutted and bumpy, but &apos;at least our bums stayed on our seats&apos;, as Fi put it. On other bus journeys, dubious suspension and potholed road surfaces combined to create moments of weightlessness leavened only by the sharp crack of skull on luggage rack above. On the Siem Reap bus we fell asleep. One night in Bangkok is supposed to be enough to make the world your oyster. So we recklessly spent two to ensure the rest of the trip is a pearl. We then hopped a sleeper train south towards Singapore. At the Malaysian border a rather fearsome sign on the immigration office wall read: &apos;How to identify an alien with &quot;hippy&quot; characteristics.&apos; The &apos;giveaway&apos; signs included: &apos;Wearing singlet without innerwear, unrespectable shorts, sandals (that are not part of national costume), unrespectable silk pants, dirty or untidy hair and an impolite manner.&apos; We looked nervously at each other in our baggy linen trousers and flip-flops, Fi with her sarong slung loosely round her neck. &apos;Persons matching this description,&apos; the sign continued, &apos;will be immediately deport.&apos; Thankfully they let us in. &apos;Hippy thinking&apos; is obviously not on the watch-list.

Ewan McGregor&apos;s Iago will take on Kevin Kline&apos;s Cyrano de Bergerac. On the catwalk, Stella McCartney will be fighting for the limelight with Gwen Stefani. The unofficial battle for the title World Capital of Cool is about to resume. There are only two big beasts in the jungle: New York, once the undisputed champion, and London, seen by many as rapidly closing the gap. Debate about their respective merits raged earlier this year when London emerged as a threat to the Big Apple&apos;s financial dominance. It is about to start again as the cities go head to head in an autumn culture war. New York has struck an early blow after being voted the &apos;coolest city in the world&apos; in research published today. An online survey of more than 2,500 people aged 18-35 was commissioned by STA Travel and CoolBrands, part of the Superbrands consultancy. New York was rated number one for &apos;coolness&apos; with 14 per cent of the vote, followed by London on 10 per cent. It is a measure of how far the British capital&apos;s thriving bars, restaurants and shops have come in recent years that it beat perennial favourites Sydney, Barcelona, San Francisco, Rio de Janeiro, Bangkok, Paris, Tokyo and Berlin in the top 10. But the perceived gulf between London and the rest of Britain was laid bare by an associated poll to find the world&apos;s coolest countries. Australia topped the rankings, followed by New Zealand, Thailand and America, whereas the UK failed to make the top 20. Stephen Cheliotis, chairman of the CoolBrands Council, said the results did not surprise him: &apos;Historically, New York has been seen as the self-proclaimed capital of the world. Almost everyone feels they know New York, even if they haven&apos;t been there, because they&apos;ve seen so many films and TV programmes. The way it has bounced back after 9/11 has shown New Yorkers&apos; &quot;can do&quot; attitude. &apos;But London is starting to challenge, not only in the City, but for the crown of capital of the world. Not quite as many films are set there, although the latest Harry Potter will probably be one of the biggest of the year. Its location is also important: people are familiar with New York from a distant point of view, but if they know London it&apos;s probably because they&apos;ve been there.&apos; For a long time New York held the upper hand. John Lennon, who moved to Manhattan, put it succinctly: &apos;If I&apos;d lived in Roman times, I&apos;d have lived in Rome. Where else? Today America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself.&apos; But in January New York was rattled when the mayor, Michael Bloomberg, warned that Wall Street was losing ground to the City. An article in New York Magazine also detected a shift: &apos;If Paris was the capital of the 19th century and New York of the 20th, London is shaping up to be the capital of the 21st century... In short, New York is cardiganed Woody Allen and London is party-dressed Lily Allen.&apos; The British capital, which beat New York to host the 2012 Olympics, will receive another boost in November when the spectacularly restored St Pancras station offers a high-speed link to Paris. The next frontline will be the catwalk. New York Fashion Week is currently under way to be followed on Saturday by its London equivalent. New York has the big money glamour but does not impress everyone. James Huckbody, fashion features editor of British Elle, said: &apos;New York is all about the bottom dollar, so the clothes tend to be more customer-friendly. They don&apos;t always make for revolutionary catwalk moments.&apos; New York&apos;s show is dominated by fashion behemoths Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein, moonlighting celebrities - such as singer Gwen Stefani&apos;s label LAMB - and labels like Marchesa, famous for making red-carpet dresses for Hollywood starlets. This makes it all the more galling that British designers nurtured by London Fashion Week often decamp to New York to boost their profile. Alice Temperley has shown there since 2003 and Preen made their American debut last Thursday night. The exodus means that London Fashion Week typically relies on new talent. But not this time. Matthew Williamson and Luella Bartley, two of the most successful names in fashion, have quit New York to show in London again. As Bartley&apos;s friends include Kate Moss, her show and shop opening will be the events of the week. Stella McCartney will also be in town for a collaboration with Adidas, although she prefers to show her main collection elsewhere. But London&apos;s impetus always comes from new designers who may now steal New York&apos;s thunder. Christopher Kane has been tipped for success by Vogue editor Anna Wintour and is already a consultant for Versace, even though he is only showing his third collection. Elsewhere, the cities will slug it out with blockbuster exhibitions guaranteed to attract thousands of visitors. Terracotta warriors from the tomb of the emperor Qin Shi Huang in Xi&apos;an, China, go on display at the British Museum this week in what is already one of the fastest selling shows of all time. A selection of Ancient Egyptian treasures from the tomb of Tutankhamun will be the star attraction at the O2, the former Millennium Dome, from November. Tate Britain is preparing an exhibition dedicated to the Pre-Raphaelite John Everett Millais. New York&apos;s ripostes include a major exhibition of Rembrandt and other Dutch masters at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, while the Neue Galerie will mount works by Gustav Klimt. Glittering film festivals are coming up in both cities, with New York premiering Wes Anderson&apos;s The Darjeeling Limited with Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, and Jason Schwartzman as brothers journeying through India. The riotously subversive Sarah Silverman is among notable turns at the New York Comedy Festival. At the theatre, Londoners are looking forward to Chiwetel Ejiofor and Ewan McGregor in Othello at the Donmar Warehouse, Jonathan Pryce in David Mamet&apos;s Glengarry Glen Ross at the Apollo, and dancer Carlos Acosta at Sadler&apos;s Wells. New Yorkers, meanwhile, will be treated to Cyrano de Bergerac starring Kevin Kline and Jennifer Garner, Pygmalion with Claire Danes, and Young Frankenstein, a Mel Brooks-Thomas Meehan musical directed and choreographed by Susan Stroman. The Royal Shakespeare Company has a foot in both camps: King Lear and The Seagull, both starring Sir Ian McKellen, will open in New York before travelling to London. Nicholas Hytner, artistic director of the National Theatre, has no doubt which city is king. &apos;As far as English-speaking theatre is concerned, London is the world capital, and I don&apos;t think anyone in New York would dispute that,&apos; he said. &apos;Theatre is part of the national conversation here in a way that it isn&apos;t in America.&apos; Asked if he rated London as the coolest city in the world, Hytner added: &apos;You bet. It&apos;s not the most beautiful, but it&apos;s the most exciting.&apos; But Ed Victor, the New York-born literary agent who divides his time between the two cities, said: &apos;Depending on how you define &quot;cool&quot;, I&apos;d say New York is cooler, but London is more cosmopolitan. Take a look around New York at the people, the fashion, the shops - it&apos;s more cutting edge. But the culture, the art, the museums in London are ahead. They are the two greatest places in the world. They are not cities, but city states, which Sydney is not: it is parochial by comparison.&apos; Indeed, the two cities have more in common with each other than with their own countries, according to Tony Travers, an academic at the London School of Economics. &apos;Trying to make a precise judgment between them is very difficult,&apos; he said. &apos;Even in New York they&apos;re slightly alert to the fact that London is gaining on them. The confidence of a thousand years of developed democracy and a carnival-on-the-edge-of-frenzy atmosphere gives London a good chance in the modern world.&apos; The case for London Rachel Halliburton, deputy editor, Time Out Where&apos;s the best restaurant in London to blow the bank?

To the horror of many people in the Department for International Development, and most of Latin America, the man who used to be a Tory donor but has switched his financial support to Labour, is now an official adviser on rainforest conservation. Judging from his own works, Eliasch&apos;s big idea is green colonialism - buying up vast acres of forest, and stopping anyone felling any trees. It is a conservation idea that has failed for nearly 100 years and is now seen as pretty offensive. &quot;The Amazon is not for sale,&quot; said the angry president of Brazil, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, after Eliasch bought 400,000 hectares of Amazonas state. The Brazilian authorities have been interested in how he came to buy so much land when he is not a citizen. Field trip Eliasch&apos;s connection to Labour comes via social reformer Frank Field MP, who has not spent much time in rainforests but who believes that the rich can price deforestation out of the market by securing land that would otherwise be sold to loggers and ranchers. What is truly frightening is that foreign secretary David Miliband, when environment secretary, was fearfully enthusiastic, and that Tony Blair is a supporter of Eliasch&apos;s charity Cool Earth. Fighting fit Most people fighting a development give up when the case goes against them. Not the people of Ruabon, north Wales.

At least eight British holidaymakers were among 42 survivors, though many of them were taken to hospital with burns. Passengers described how they scrambled over burning bodies in the panic to get out of the cabin after the McDonnell Douglas MD-82, operated by the Thai airline One-Two-Go, came down in heavy rain and cross winds, skidded on the runway, broke in two and burst into flames. Chaisak Angsuwan, director general of the Thai air transport authority, said bad weather in the area had played a part as the pilot made his approach. &quot;The visibility was poor as the pilot attempted to land. He decided to make a go-around, but the plane lost balance and crashed.&quot; The deputy governor of Phuket island, Worapot Ratthaseema, said the dead passengers included Irish people, Israelis, Australians and Britons. The Foreign Office confirmed that there were Britons on the plane, which was on a scheduled 80-minute trip from Bangkok. Some 78 foreigners were said to have been on board. The Thai health ministry issued a partial list of 31 foreign survivors, which included five Britons. Three Irish people were accounted for, but one remained missing. Speaking from his hospital bed, Irishman John O&apos;Donnell described the plane&apos;s landing: &quot;You can tell it was in trouble, because it kind of landed then came up again the second time. &quot;I came out on the wing of the plane ... the exit door, it was kind of crushed and I had to squeeze through. And saw my friend, he was outside. He just got out before me. And next thing, it really caught fire, then I just got badly burned, my face, my legs, my arms.&quot; Investigators last night began sifting though the wreckage, while rescue workers still had to recover five bodies. Another five survivors were in a critical condition, with 60% burns to their bodies. A spokesman at Bangkok Phuket hospital said that it was treating five British men and two women, none in a life-threatening condition. Britain&apos;s ambassador to Thailand, Quinton Quayle, was driving overnight to the crash site where he will co-ordinate officials from Bangkok, Hong Kong and London.

Nong Khaonual, a Thai passenger, said he believed the plane descended too quickly. &quot;I have never seen anything like this. It descended very fast. Just before we touched the runway we felt the plane try to lift up and it skidded off the runway. &quot;My wife was half conscious and I dragged her out the emergency exit.

Here are my answers. Naomi, there has been debate on these boards as to how the damning causal link between the Bush administration&apos;s foreign policy and their economic interests, one of the primary ideas raised in your book, can possibly reach the people who decide the president&apos;s power. What are your views on leftist-thought and its relationship with society at large? Comment 811145, DesignerBaby I think you&apos;re talking about how to reach American voters (on paper, the &quot;people who decide the president&apos;s power&quot;). And to me, it&apos;s clear that if I did reach them, we couldn&apos;t simply be talking about who they vote for, but how to reform the entire flawed system of US electoral democracy. And I admit it seems like a long shot, given the record of the last seven years. From my own experience, I know what a challenge it is to even reach these readers: No Logo was very much a mainstream book here in the UK, as well as my country, Canada, but in the US it never reached much beyond the left/campus crowd. I sometimes think, speaking personally, that we don&apos;t try hard enough to reach the American mainstream because breaking through the media barriers is so much work, and the reward - getting treated like a space alien on a CNN chat show - doesn&apos;t tend to feel that rewarding. That said, based on my preliminary experience of talking about this book in North America, I think the time may be ripe for a change. In left/liberal circles, people are really feeling the limits of pouring their energy and creativity exclusively into partisan Democrat v Republican, Obama v Giuliani politics. The 2006 US midterm elections, after which the Democrats failed to act on Iraq, has left many disillusioned and interested in getting to the deeper sickness in their culture, which afflicts both parties - the stranglehold on power by corporations. I take heart from polls like one earlier this year from New York Times/CBS, which found that 64% of US citizens believed the government should guarantee healthcare coverage to all and &quot;showed a striking willingness ... to make tradeoffs&quot; to achieve that goal, including paying up to $500 a year more in taxes. I have also, incidentally, noticed that the right in North America, on whom I can usually count to valiantly defend the free market against the likes of me, seems uncharacteristically timid and uncertain. It feels like a moment when anything could happen. What choices do you think are available to whoever Bush&apos;s successor will be, in terms of foreign policy and domestic issues? Do you think they&apos;ll be capable of breaking the stranglehold corporate America has on the White House, or indeed even want to? Comment 811150, Finite187 See above. The problems are embedded in the electoral system. Put simply, US elections are way too expensive: the 2008 presidential race is set to cost more than $1bn. If Americans are going to have leaders whose first debt is to the people who gave them their votes, rather than to those who slipped them the funds to buy TV ads, US voters first need to demand a radical discount on the political process - real campaign finance reform, including demanding that the private companies using public airwaves donate far more time to candidates. This is an urgent issue affecting the entire world. Readers of the Guardian extracts of The Shock Doctrine know that I am examining the &quot;war on terror&quot; not as a military campaign but as a thriving new economy. The companies at the heart of this economy are equal opportunity campaign contributors. Furthermore, the &quot;homeland security&quot; companies, whose future depends on the US maintaining its state of constant siege, have aggressively been building policy thinktanks, lobby firms, and merging with media companies. Sadly, dismantling this complex will take more than voting. So, Naomi, is the free market, or America, good for anything? What would your ideal society look like, and more importantly, how would it sustain itself? Positive vibrations? Comment 811931, TheresaKlein It depends on what we mean by &quot;sustain itself&quot;, since the status quo is far from sustainable. With climate change threatening our very survival, thanks in part to the pursuit of unrestrained growth at the heart of free market doctrine, it seems to me that it is far more urgent for free market enthusiasts to tell us how they plan to sustain their model. The book does explore the question of alternatives, in far greater depth than I can do here. Suffice it to say that the argument of The Shock Doctrine - ie why I am focusing on shock - is that the assertion that there are no alternatives has always been a lie. At every critical historical juncture I examine in the book, there were alternatives to radical free market economics. People often voted for them in huge numbers, from (just to name a few) Allende in Chile in 1970, to Solidarity in Poland in 1989 and the ANC in South Africa in 1994. The alternatives that that those parties ran on - Allende&apos;s democratic socialism, Solidarity&apos;s economic programme of worker cooperatives, and the ANC&apos;s election platform of redistributing land and resources to the country&apos;s black majority - were not tried and found wanting. They were chosen democratically, then strangled in the crib before they even had a chance to fail. In some cases they were pre-disciplined by market shocks. In others they were crushed by army tanks (in collaboration with thinktanks). Today there is, as there always has been, a wide range of alternatives that are being explored and proposed. Latin America has new trade bloc, called ALBA, which is trying to articulate a new international trading philosophy. And people like George Monbiot, in his indispensable book Heat, are laying out specific policy alternatives to cope with climate change. In my country, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (full disclosure: my brother works there) issues a regular alternative budget to show how the same finite resources could be allocated in a more equitable and sustainable way within the current system. The old &quot;you have no alternative&quot; trope has worked for a good 25 years. Time to get a new line. If &quot;disaster capitalism&quot; thrives, as you say, on ... well ... disaster, do you believe that those who reap the economic rewards of man-made disasters are actively involved in fomenting them in the first place? Comment 812341, deepblue No. What I argue in the book is that part of the reason why conspiracy theories are so rampant is that people see the enormous political and economic benefits reaped in the aftermath of disasters and conclude that the winners must be involved in dark plots to create those disasters in the first place. More accurate, I think, is the idea that our political and corporate elites exist in a state of acute intellectual disaster preparedness. So when the disasters hit, the companies, the lobbyists, and the policy framework are all ready to go (that&apos;s what rightwing thinktanks are for). I would go so far as to say that we can clearly see in much of our leadership class a disquieting comfort with the prospect of disaster. This video clip, of Bush being warned about the impending catastrophe in New Orleans, seems to capture the relaxed mood perfectly. The comfort with crisis may also explain the lack of urgency on such issues as climate change and Middle East peace. The prevailing attitude was best summed up by Donald Rumsfeld while Baghdad was being looted: &quot;Stuff happens.&quot; It is a fact of life predating neoliberalism by millions of years that &quot;chaos is opportunity&quot;. The fall of a tree in an ancient forest is a chaos causing opportunity grasped by many species of plant and animal. Given that that is the case, isn&apos;t it a bit asinine to pretend only neoliberals take advantage, or to present taking advantage of chaos as bad? Comment 812689, sluijser Since this keeps coming up, I&apos;m going to restate a clarifying point from an earlier post: I know totalitarian communists and fascists have used these tactics, and I acknowledge this fully in the book. The difference is that these ideologies have been held accountable for their crimes. Contemporary capitalism has never faced this kind of accountability, and it&apos;s high time. There is also an important qualitative difference between contemporary disaster capitalism and the times that crisis has become an opportunity for democratic reform - for instance the New Deal after the market crash of 1929 or the democratic opening up in Mexico after the 1985 earthquake. Crisis is always an opportunity. The danger comes when crises are used specifically to exclude people from democratic participation and dramatically restrict debate - the modus operandi from Iraq to New Orleans. Are the concerns of the American and European left anything more than a dilettante parlour game for the bourgeoisie? And if not, how do you account for the spectacular lack of affinity with your ideals in the developing world, particularly Asia, where turbo-capitalism is admired far more than even in the chambers of commerce in the west? Comment 811387, henrykrinkel Reality check. World Trade Organisation talks have been off the rails for four years. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are both in crisis, their influence dramatically eroded from where it was only a few years ago. Plans to launch a new free trade zone stretching from Alaska to Chile have been scrapped. None of this is because of a dilettante game in the parlours of the global north. It is because the policies of the so-called Washington Consensus are being challenged by mass peoples&apos; movements in the global south, movements that are preventing even neoliberal-minded governments from pushing forward with this agenda. As for Asia, generalisations are dangerous. To cite just two recent examples that don&apos;t fit your portrait, there was recently a military coup in Thailand because street protests against corrupt privatisation plans had taken over Bangkok. In China there were 87,000 protests and labour disruptions in 2005, according to the government&apos;s own statistics. These are complex countries with many competing interests, but it&apos;s safe to say that someone isn&apos;t happy with turbo-capitalism. Why are you trying to connect a lot of historically disparate events (Chile, Falklands, Chine, Russia) with disparate current events (Iraq, tsunami, Katrina) in a grand overarching theory of cause and effect which the facts don&apos;t necessarily fit? Instead would it not be better to concentrate on the expose of the Bush administration. After all greed (whether of individuals, governments or corporates) is nothing new. Comment 811851, johnwilliams I obviously believe they are connected, and that there is a relationship between real-world shocks and the ability to impose economic shock therapy. I am convinced that the evidence marshalled in the book supports this. (One more reminder: the book has only just come out today in the UK and the US; most of this debate is taking place among people who haven&apos;t read it.) I also think it&apos;s crucial that the current crimes of the Bush administration are not disconnected from our recent history. Bush and Cheney are not a couple of bad apples - something we are all about to discover after they leave office and these policies continue. It&apos;s time to look at the logic. Do you think democracy will outlive the century, as it&apos;s not looking too good right now? Comment 813157 JuanKerr It depends if we allow democracy to continue to be starved of its power. Where democracy is reduced to the ritual of voting, often with little impact on the policies that follow, many do lose faith. In some countries, such as Poland and Russia, we are seeing alarming numbers of people expressing their disappointment with the betrayals of liberal democracy by turning to fascism; in other parts of the world, religious fundamentalism steps into the opening. We see something different in democracies where voters feel that the ballots they cast can have a real impact on the economic doctrine governing their country. Contentious as it is, Venezuela is a good example. In a 2006 Latinobar\u00f3metro poll, 57% of Venezuelans said they were happy with the state of their democracy, an approval rating on the continent second only to Uruguay&apos;s, where the leftwing coalition party Frente Amplio had been elected to government and where a series of referendums had blocked major privatisations. Having read the extracts published in the Guardian, I am sure many like-minded folks agree with your central thesis regarding disaster capitalism - my question is, how do &quot;we&quot;, a disparate, loosely-defined &quot;community&quot; of people concerned about the impact of corporate exploitation of the vulnerable, how do we acutaly ACT to make a difference? Comment 813143, Teek Thanks for this crucial question. It&apos;s easy to get overwhelmed when the problems are so vast. So ... short of bringing about a revolution in global economic doctrine, there are a few things we can do right away to confront Disaster Capitalism in its current hotspots. In Britain, there are several fantastic campaigns focused on various forms of disaster capitalism. A great place to start is Hands Off Iraq&apos;s Oil. This extraordinary coalition of activists is doing everything possible to block the backroom attempts to hand over Iraq&apos;s oil wealth to foreign multinationals. On its website, you can read about specific things you can do, from asking your MP to sign early day motion 1180 (demanding disclosure of all representations made by the UK government regarding the oil law), to writing letters to the editor every time you see the law described as a &quot;revenue-sharing&quot; initiative or a &quot;reconciliation&quot; measure. Tourism Concern and ActionAid International are both doing important work with Asian Tsunami survivors fighting to recover their land. And readers in the US who want to connect with the fight against disaster capitalism in New Orleans can start with Common Ground and the New Orleans Workers Justice Coalition. Both work in coalitions with many other frontline groups. I have more links on my own website and we are updating it all the time. Is there anything inherently flawed in human nature that we allow [ourselves] to be manipulated so easily by religious institutions and big business more recently? Can education help us, if most universities function only as brands? Comment 811144, delocater Education can always help, though it&apos;s true that many academic institutions are not only their own brands but are also embedded in the disaster capitalism complex, getting huge contracts to work with the military and large corporations. With so much research money to be had in the growing field of disaster response and privatised reconstruction (not to mention &quot;humanitarian intervention&quot;), we can&apos;t assume that universities are willing to challenge the disaster capitalism paradigm. But I do have great faith in human nature, flawed as we all are. We hear a great deal about the terrible things humans do to each other, but having spent a good deal of time in disaster zones over the last five years, I have been repeatedly struck by the enormous generosity that always seems to characterise the initial response - from the neighbourhood assemblies that sprang up in Argentina after the economic meltdown of 2001/2002, to the tens of thousands of volunteers who have gone to New Orleans to help rebuild homes and lives. The trick is to force our politicians - who are, after all, spending our money - to act in this same sprit of genuine aid.

The deputy transport minister, Sansern Wongcha-um, told reporters that 89 people, including 53 foreigners, had been killed in the crash, and 41 others injured. An unofficial list compiled by the Thai foreign ministry showed that among the dead were six Britons, three Israelis, two Americans, two French nationals, and one each from Australia, Germany, Iran, Ireland and Sweden.  However, the list was incomplete as more than 30 foreign fatalities had not yet been identified.  The budget One-Two-Go Airlines flight was carrying 123 passengers and seven crew from Bangkok to Phuket when it skidded off a runway yesterday while landing in driving wind and rain. The plane caught fire, engulfing some passengers in flames as others tried to escape.  Israel and Australia have offered to identify the charred bodies from the crash. Eight experts from Israel, which sent a team to the island to help identify the nearly 5,500 victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, were due to arrive on Phuket tomorrow.  &quot;We welcome any offer from foreign friends,&quot; a foreign ministry spokesman, Piriya Khempon, told Reuters.  Investigators have recovered the two flight recorders, or &quot;black boxes&quot;, that should shed light on the reasons behind the crash. &quot;We are still unable to say the cause of accident,&quot; the transport minister, Theera Haocharoen, said. &quot;The officials have found the black boxes and will send them for analysis to the United States. Hopefully we will learn in a few weeks the cause of accident.&quot; Kajit Habnanonda, the president of Orient-Thai Airlines, which owns One-Two-Go, said wind shear - the rapid change in wind speed that can affect takeoffs and landings - was a possible cause of the accident. He said heavy rain could also have contributed to the plane skidding off the runway. The deputy governor of Phuket, Worapot Ratthaseema, said British passengers were among the dead, along with Irish, French, German, Israeli and Australian travellers. Reports have put the British death toll at around 10, with eight survivors, but the Foreign Office was unable to give exact figures on the Britons involved. The British ambassador to Thailand, Quinton Quayle, who arrived in Phuket with a 10-strong embassy team, said he believed that &quot;several&quot; British nationals had died in the crash. &quot;Identifying victims positively is a very difficult process after an accident in which the plane caught fire and unfortunately many of the people on board were disfigured,&quot; he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. &quot;We want to get it right and that requires some painstaking work by my staff. As soon as we have got definitive information we will, of course, release it.&quot; Mr Quayle said he had spoken to two British survivors, who were in &quot;good shape and pretty good heart&quot;. &quot;We helped them to communicate with their families and friends in the UK,&quot; he said.  A spokesman for Bangkok Phuket hospital confirmed the names of six British survivors they were treating as Benjamin Zachary Green, 24; Peter James Hill, 35; Ashley Scott Harrow, 27; Christopher Edward Cooley, 23; William Burke, 23, and Mahsa Fatoorechi. He did not have the name of a second British woman being treated, and could not give details about their injuries or where they were from in Britain. There had been a total of 78 foreign passengers on board the plane, according to Monrudee Gettuphan, the vice-president of corporate communications for the air transport authority of Thailand. Survivors said the aircraft was preparing to land in heavy rain when it suddenly lifted off again, then crashed down on the runway. It rammed through a low retaining wall and split in two. Survivors described their escape amid chaos, smoke and fire. &quot;I think he realised the runway was too close or he was too fast or the wind had hit him,&quot; Robert Borland, a Swiss survivor, told the Associated Press. &quot;He accelerated and tried to pull out. I thought, he is going around again, and the next thought was everything went black and there was a big mess and we hit the ground.&quot; Mr Borland, 48, who lives in Australia, said his trousers caught fire. He managed to drag himself to an exit from where he was pulled to safety by another survivor. &quot;People were screaming. There was a fire in the cabin and my clothes caught fire,&quot; he said. Many of the passengers had been planning to holiday at Phuket, a popular beach resort that was among the areas hit hardest by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which killed more than 8,000 people on the island. The crash was the country&apos;s deadliest aviation accident since December 11 1998, when 101 people were killed when a Thai Airways plane crashed while trying to land in heavy rain at Surat Thani, 330 miles south of Bangkok. Forty-five people survived. The accident raised new questions about the safety of budget airlines in south-east Asia, which have grown rapidly in number in recent years and often struggle to find qualified pilots. Airline officials said the pilot of the crashed plane was experienced. None of Thailand&apos;s budget airlines has previously suffered a major accident, but there have been several deadly crashes in Indonesia. Many budget airlines use older planes that have been leased or bought after years of use by other airlines. According to Thai and US aviation registration data, the plane that crashed in Phuket was manufactured and put into use in 1983. It began flying in Thailand in March this year. One-Two-Go Airlines, which began operating in December 2003, is the domestic subsidiary of Orient-Thai Airlines, a regional charter carrier based in Thailand.", "publicationDate": "2007-09-17T14:41:04Z", "tags": ["World news", "Travel", "Thailand", "Plane crashes", "Air transport", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/17/travelnews.thailand", "title": "Thai investigators work to identify plane crash victims", "sentences": ["The budget One-Two-Go Airlines flight was carrying 123 passengers and seven crew from Bangkok to Phuket when it skidded off a runway yesterday while landing in driving wind and rain.", "A spokesman for Bangkok Phuket hospital confirmed the names of six British survivors they were treating as Benjamin Zachary Green, 24; Peter James Hill, 35; Ashley Scott Harrow, 27; Christopher Edward Cooley, 23; William Burke, 23, and Mahsa Fatoorechi.", "The crash was the country&apos;s deadliest aviation accident since December 11 1998, when 101 people were killed when a Thai Airways plane crashed while trying to land in heavy rain at Surat Thani, 330 miles south of Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Survivors of the Phuket air crash expressed disbelief and anger yesterday that their plane had been given permission to land despite a monsoon storm with winds so fierce that they bent back palm trees. Amid reports that the pilot aborted one approach because he could not see the runway through the driving rain, the question of why the airport remained open in such appalling weather looks likely to be a key issue for Thai accident investigators. Yesterday, they began sifting through the charred wreckage of Sunday&apos;s accident, in which 89 people were killed, as One-Two-Go airlines flight OG269 from Bangkok skidded on the wet runway and crashed into a wooded embankment. Thirty-nine passengers and two crew escaped by crawling out of the burning fuselage. Most are in hospital with smoke inhalation, broken bones and burns. An unofficial list from the Thai foreign ministry said that at least six Britons were among the dead, although the Foreign Office would not confirm this. Last night a Foreign Office spokeswoman confirmed that three British survivors were in hospital, one of them in a critical condition. Gordon Brown said that he was deeply saddened. &quot;My thoughts are with all those families waiting for news of loved ones, and those currently receiving treatment for their injuries,&quot; he said. A team of international forensic experts will fly in to help identify the bodies. Many were still strapped to their seats, either knocked unconscious by the impact of the failed landing, suffocated by noxious fumes, or consumed by the flames that quickly spread through the McDonnell Douglas MD-82. Investigators have recovered the plane&apos;s two &quot;black box&quot; flight data recorders, which will be sent to the US for analysis. &quot;Hopefully, we will learn in a few weeks the cause of the accident,&quot; transport minister Theera Haocharoen told reporters. Airline officials, nearby residents and survivors pointed to the dire weather conditions as a central factor. Kajit Habnanonda, president of Orient-Thai Airlines, which owns One-Two-Go, said a rapid change in wind speed was a possible cause. &quot;It is possible the plane crash was caused by wind shear,&quot; he said. According to the Bangkok Post, the Indonesian pilot, who died in the crash, aborted a first attempt at landing, explaining to air traffic controllers that visibility was so low he could not see the runway. But a transcript of the last conversation between the control tower and the plane revealed that ground officials had informed the pilot about wind shear at the airport but he decided to land anyway, the air transport department&apos;s director general Chaisak Ungsuwan said on The Nation TV channel. &quot;The last word the pilot said was &apos;landing&apos;,&quot; he said. Survivors said they could not understand why the pilot tried to touch down. Marcel Squinobal, an Austrian, said the plane had bounced up and down and swerved dramatically. &quot;I don&apos;t understand why we didn&apos;t fly to Krabi and we could have taken a bus to Phuket,&quot; he told the Associated Press, referring to Krabi airport which is four or five hours&apos; drive away. Airport director Pornchai Ua-aree told reporters that visibility was 3-4km and the winds were not so strong, at about 11 knots or 19km an hour. Airport staff told the Guardian that another plane had landed safely less than half an hour before the accident. Questions have also been raised about the safety standards of budget airlines. One-Two-Go is one of many recent start-ups in Asia, where an aviation boom has led to a shortage of pilots and to ageing planes staying in use. The plane that crashed in Phuket was made in 1983. A couple who won the trip to Thailand in a competition are feared to be among the British dead. Judy and Anthony Weston, both in their 60s, had sold their home in Bristol and were heading for their two-week prize holiday before emigrating to Australia to be with their new grandson. The Irish government confirmed that 23-year-old graduate Aaron Toland was also among those who died. His friend Christopher Cooley survived with head and chest injuries and is in hospital, along with two other Irish tourists. Also on board were Welsh couple Alex Collins and Bethan Jones, both 22, who had embarked on a six month global trip only last week, according to Mr Collins&apos; Facebook profile. Ms Jones, from Rhondda, south Wales, is in hospital but her boyfriend, an English literature graduate from Maesteg, is believed to be missing. \u00b7 Additional reporting by Matthew Taylor, Henry McDonald and Rachel Williams.", "publicationDate": "2007-09-18T00:42:44Z", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Thailand holidays", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/sep/18/theairlineindustry.thailand", "title": "Survivors angry that pilot tried  to land plane in monsoon storm", "sentences": ["Yesterday, they began sifting through the charred wreckage of Sunday&apos;s accident, in which 89 people were killed, as One-Two-Go airlines flight OG269 from Bangkok skidded on the wet runway and crashed into a wooded embankment.", "According to the Bangkok Post, the Indonesian pilot, who died in the crash, aborted a first attempt at landing, explaining to air traffic controllers that visibility was so low he could not see the runway."]}, {"article": "A British survivor of the crash at Phuket airport was hailed as a hero yesterday, after it emerged that he had risked his life to save fellow passengers. Peter Hill, 35, reportedly forced open the emergency exit, and pulled up to three other travellers to safety, after the plane skidded off the runway and burst into flames. Yesterday the Mancunian was visited in the Bangkok-Phuket hospital by Thailand&apos;s prime minister, Surayud Chulanont, and foreign minister Nitya Pibulsonggram. &quot;He is a hero. I believe he pulled two people out at his own risk. He is now doing pretty well, sitting up and smiling,&quot; Mr Nitya told reporters. The Bangkok Post reported that Mr Hill saved Ashley Harrow, sitting next to him, and then an Israeli couple, Vladimir and Isabella Freylikhman. But the Mancunian said yesterday that he could not really remember what happened. He said he recalled trying to get the door open but nothing else. &quot;Honestly, at the moment I can&apos;t remember,&quot; he told the New York Times from his hospital bed. &quot;I was sitting next to the - next to the exit, but it could be the other guy. It could be that both of us got the door open. I can&apos;t remember.&quot; Mildred Furlong, a waitress from British Columbia, had described how a man behind her in a black shirt, who she remembered smiling at as she got on the plane, had kicked at the stuck door repeatedly as the cabin filled with smoke, and credited him with saving the lives of most of the passengers who survived. &quot;He&apos;s the only way anybody escaped,&quot; she told the New York Times. &quot;He kicked the emergency exit that everybody got through.&quot; She added: &quot;At first it was just a crack. It was quite difficult to make it peel back. And then finally it did, at the last second, right before everybody passed out.&quot; A nurse told Ms Furlong that the man who had kicked the door open was British, and that he remembered her. Mr Hill, who was sitting in seat 24A, said he had been wearing a black shirt, but so had the man sitting next to him - 27-year-old Ashley Harrow from Moira, Northern Ireland, who was also recovering in hospital. Both men were reported to have been visited yesterday by the British ambassador to Thailand, Quinton Quayle. An unnamed Thai man was also said to have saved at least one life. Australian Robert Borland, described how he lay helpless on the plane&apos;s floor, his arm broken and his clothes on fire, before being pulled to safety by a Thai passenger in a yellow shirt. &quot;Everything was upside down, or at least it felt that way,&quot; he said. &quot;My clothes caught fire, my trousers. All I remember is I was on the floor and thinking, what&apos;s going on, whose arm is this? Then I noticed it was my watch on the wrist, so it must be attached to me somehow. I couldn&apos;t have gotten out myself, and I&apos;m pretty sure a Thai man in a yellow shirt helped me get out on to the wing. I have no idea who he was, or where he came from. Then I fell off the wing.&quot; His legs were burned and his left arm broken at the elbow. &quot;I&apos;m glad to be alive.

A further three Britons remained in hospital, one of them in a critical condition, David Miliband said.  One of those lucky enough to escape from the burning jet was Ashley Harrow. Speaking from his hospital bed, Mr Harrow said he was at best a &quot;reluctant hero&quot; for his role in opening passenger doors moments after the crash. The 27-year-old engineer from Belfast, in Northern Ireland, was sitting next to the emergency exit on the budget One-Two-Go flight from Bangkok which crashed as it attempted to land, bursting into a fireball which killed 89 people.  It was Thailand&apos;s worst air disaster for a decade - raising fears that it could dent the country&apos;s tourist economy, particularly in Phuket where the 12-year-old McDonnell-Douglas 82 jet smashed into the airport runway.  Mr Harrow peeled back the door, which had initially been breached by his travelling companion Peter Hill, and fled the flames, but he said neither of them deserved any credit for rescuing other passengers.  &quot;Peter jumped and I followed him out on the wing. There was smoke and I could feel the flames. There was a fireball. To be honest we just started running and kept on going,&quot; Mr Harrow told the Guardian.  &quot;I only turned round later and just saw this black cloud pouring out of the plane. I expected to see dozens of people coming out. But there was no one.&quot;  Mr Harrow said he collapsed in pain amid the smoke and chaos, coming to in hospital where doctors told him he had fractured his back. Asleep when the plane started its descent, Mr Harrow was jolted awake after being thrown forward by the impact. He is expected to stay in hospital for another week.  &quot;To be honest Peter and I are both pretty embarrassed by all this hero stuff. We opened the door that&apos;s all. [When we crashed] it was just madness. I thought, I just want out of this. It was just a fluke Peter and I were next to the emergency exit.&quot;  Mr Hill, a teacher from Manchester who has been publicly praised by the Thai prime minister for his assumed heroism, today posted a sign outside his hospital room saying he would not be giving any interviews.  &quot;He does not want any of this hero stuff,&quot; said Mr Harrow. &quot;Neither do I. I just want to make the full moon beach party next week and finish my holiday.&quot;  The actions of the pair came too late for many others. The 89 people recorded dead came from at least 10 countries, including Britain, the US, Australia, France, Germany, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Sweden and Thailand.  Forty people required hospital treatment. All the medical costs were being met by the airline, which says it has $300m (\u00a3150.2m) of insurance cover.  Hospital officials in Phuket said Bethan Jones, 23, from Porth, in the Rhondda valley of south Wales, was in a critical condition and would be airlifted to Bangkok for treatment for her burns. Ms Jones had taken six months out to travel the world with her boyfriend, Alex Collins, of Maesteg, south Wales, who remains missing. Mr Collins&apos; parents, Richard and Margaret, told reporters they had &quot;no further news or information and we would request that, at this extremely traumatic time for the family, we are left alone&quot;.  Tributes to two UK victims of the tragedy were paid today. Publicans Neil and Helen Slater, from Scunthorpe, had been on holiday in the country where they married in 2003. A statement released by both their families described them as a &quot;spontaneous&quot; couple It said: &quot;They are totally devoted to each other. They work together 24 hours a day and are a great team, they do everything together.&quot; At a press conference organised by One-Two-Go, the police officer leading the investigation, Niti Buntuwong, said about 70 bodies had been identified.  Many grieving relatives had only just arrived to claim family members. In a makeshift morgue set up in a cargo terminal, the bodies were kept in cold storage amid pictures of charred corpses posted on a wall for identification.  This morning, Buddhist monks chanted prayers near the twisted wreckage at the airport to ease the dead souls&apos; departure from the Earth.  Several theories have surfaced about the cause of the crash. The early focus appeared to be on freak weather conditions - a sudden monsoon downpour and strong winds engulfed Phuket on the day of the crash.  A Thai government official today admitted half of the systems in place to detect potentially dangerous wind shear were not working at the time of the crash.  Others have questioned the age of the plane, although airline officials said the jet was expected to last 15 years. In an extraordinary step, the chairman of One-Two-Go issued a public defence of the dead pilot who some have said was foolish to land in driving rain rather than divert to another airport. The pilot had tried twice to bring down the plane before it crashed into the tarmac.  &quot;He was not hot-headed by character and had plenty of aviation experience under his belt ... The pilot who flew the doomed aircraft was one of our best. He was very experienced, patient and very decisive,&quot; the airline chairman, Kajit Hapananont, told the Bangkok Post.  Another plane had landed just before the ill-fated jet attempted to land.  An airline spokeswoman told the Guardian that until the flight data recorders, or black boxes, had been analysed by the plane&apos;s manufacturer in the United States - a process that could take weeks - it would be difficult to &quot;do much more than speculate&quot;. &quot;The weather was bad but we cannot say how much it contributed to the crash.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-09-18T18:01:40Z", "tags": ["World news", "Thailand", "Plane crashes", "Air transport", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/18/thailand", "title": "Eight Britons killed in Thai plane crash", "sentences": ["The 27-year-old engineer from Belfast, in Northern Ireland, was sitting next to the emergency exit on the budget One-Two-Go flight from Bangkok which crashed as it attempted to land, bursting into a fireball which killed 89 people.", "Hospital officials in Phuket said Bethan Jones, 23, from Porth, in the Rhondda valley of south Wales, was in a critical condition and would be airlifted to Bangkok for treatment for her burns.", "He was very experienced, patient and very decisive,&quot; the airline chairman, Kajit Hapananont, told the Bangkok Post."]}, {"article": "Eight Britons are believed to have died in the Phuket air crash, the foreign secretary, David Miliband, said yesterday.

Mr Thaksin said he hoped to return to Thailand after elections scheduled for December, but that &quot;the situation in Thailand is changing every day&quot;. &quot;I love my country, I love my people, I have my family so I will definitely go back to Thailand and I will find the right timing,&quot; he told BBC Radio 4&apos;s Today programme. &quot;Right now I think the situation in Thailand does not permit me to go back because I don&apos;t want to be the centre of confrontation between the two sides.&quot; He said his return was dependent on &quot;reconciliation&quot; but that his removal had not solved the country&apos;s problems. He said he was just &quot;a tool to get rid of your opponent&quot;. Thailand&apos;s supreme court issued a warrant for Mr Thaksin and his wife last month over an alleged conflict of interest regarding a property sale in Bangkok. Earlier this month a second arrest warrant was issued over alleged violations in a share sale. Mr Thaksin, a telecoms billionaire before entering politics, was voted in as prime minister in 2001. Human Rights Watch tried to prevent him taking over at Manchester City, describing Mr Thaksin as &quot;a human rights abuser of the worst kind&quot;. Mr Thaksin and his wife have denied all allegations of corruption and human rights abuses.", "publicationDate": "2007-09-19T15:18:21Z", "tags": ["World news", "Football", "Thailand", "Manchester City", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/19/thailand", "title": "Former Thai PM rules out early return home", "sentences": ["Thailand&apos;s supreme court issued a warrant for Mr Thaksin and his wife last month over an alleged conflict of interest regarding a property sale in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "There&apos;s nothing like a bit of Judge Dredd-style excessive use of police force on an unarmed citizen.

There is a music video - in Portugese or Spanish - that features very cleverly drawn cartoons of people and animals based around a core image of genitalia. You have to watch it, really. The other is more predictable. A charity, in this case PETA, gets a hot Hollywood actress/global supermodel to appear in an ad, preferably with no clothes on, to promote a cause.

Now I&apos;m a Liv Tyler man myself, although Silverstone had her moment in the odd music video and Clueless, but here she more than holds her own slipping out of a swimming pool naked. The ad will win hearts and minds, well, eyeballs at least - but will it change attitudes and/or boost donations?

Well, maybe. But confronted with this counsel of despair, I can only say I prefer the wisdom of the Chicago Reader critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, the first chapter of whose revolutionary 2000 book Movie Wars, &quot;Is the Cinema Really Dead?&quot;, argues that death-of-cinema pronouncements are a recurring valedictory mode among the mandarinate, characterised by exhaustion, defeatism and historical naivety about the mixed way canonical classics were themselves actually received in the press when they were first shown. Perhaps the best antidote to the gloom is the appearance of films like this one. Profoundly mysterious, erotic, funny, gentle, playful, utterly distinctive, it is the work of the Thai director and installation-artist Apichatpong Weerasethakul, who now has a claim to be approaching the league of Kiarostami and Haneke, one of modern cinema&apos;s great practitioners. He deserves his current retrospective at London&apos;s BFI Southbank. It&apos;s a film that requires an openness of mind and heart for its music to be heard - although I do concede that the title is cumbersome and disconcerting - and it will reward this commitment of attention a hundredfold. I found it a transcendentally happy experience: inducing a joyous and calm kind of euphoria. As many people as practicable should go to see it, at least partly to increase the likelihood of someone being able to explain exactly what it is all about. What is it all about? Like Weerasethakul&apos;s previous features - Tropical Malady (2004) and Blissfully Yours (2001) - it takes as its starting point a tale of tangled human relationships, in this case the faltering love life of a demure young female doctor at a remote, upcountry Thai hospital. Then it takes off into alternative worlds, alternative realities, unrealities, surrealities. The same scenes are played again, in different settings, with different people. The Buddhist idea of reincarnation is being sported with. Or is the film simply questioning the 19th-century train-tracks of traditional narrative? Weerasethakul&apos;s camera, usually in one fixed position for a single take will suddenly drift back or to the side while one character fixes it with a serene unreadable gaze. Having gestured at the languour of romantic fulfilment and the discomfort and pain of its opposite, baffling images and sequences will unfold with the unsettling quality of a horror film. The action shows a young doctor interviewing new applicants; one declares his love for her. But a flashback - that most conventional of things - shows the shy young woman&apos;s burgeoning friendship for another man who appears to think of her only as a pal, although whether this causes her anguish is an enigma. A hospital dentist has an intimate friendship with his monk patient, an intimacy born of their mutual passion for music; the dentist is an amateur singer, the monk once dreamed of being a DJ. People, and things, are not what they seem. A tippling consultant drinks Scotch from a hidden bottle, and it is perhaps her boozy nightmare we are seeing as the camera cruises through a semi-real, misty hospital boiler room and lingers, disquietingly, on some sort of open pipe whose aperture is intended to resemble the solar eclipse which had formed the centrepiece of an earlier, epiphanic moment. Startlingly, Weerasethakul will reprise scenes we had already seen, now set apparently in a fancy modern city hospital. The manageable linear course of events is forever being bisected by unhurried exposition of related themes and images, as if Weerasethakul wishes to stop covering narrative ground in the normal way and take a conceptual soil sample. The final sequence takes place in a modern city that could be Bangkok, or perhaps it is a modern city under construction, the city of the future in which a male doctor&apos;s lover - we see their extended, passionate kiss - dreams one day of living. Syndromes and a Century is a poem on screen: a film of ideas and visual tropes that upends conventional narrative expectations, not out of a simple desire to disconcert but to break through the carapace of normality, to give us the knight&apos;s-move away from reality that the Russian formalists said was the prerogative of art. It&apos;s a movie to be compared with the work of Antonioni - or Sergei Parajanov. Perhaps, with its freakiness and scariness in those hospital basement scenes, it is something that might have intrigued Kubrick. If you want a film as challenging and exhilarating as the most weird and wonderful exhibition at Tate Modern, if you are bored with all the usual boilerplate material coming out of Hollywood, or even if you&apos;re not, then this is a film for you.

We are staying at the Four Seasons Tented Camp Golden Triangle, the first foray into canvas by the chain that has become a global synonym for five-star luxury and impeccable service. Sure enough, I don&apos;t stay cold for long as a flurry of handsome boys rush to find me a wrap, bring hot tea and light a portable fire of hot coals next to our breakfast table. The typical well-heeled Four Seasons client wants plenty of dazzle to the dollar. So would they be prepared to give up the flat-screen TVs and infinity pools to go camping? I was sceptical. That said, our arrival by motorised dugout at the camp, close to where the Thai border meets Laos and Burma, is exhilarating and the river bank scenery is straight from Asian central casting, with splashing water buffalo, cute urchins waving from thatched shacks and artfully woven fish traps bobbing on the water. The idea behind the camp is to offer guests, mainly de-stressing Americans, a &apos;soft adventure&apos; alternative to the other Thai delights of shopping, eating, spa treatments and cookery classes. They come here to learn how to ride an elephant in proper mahout style, which means sitting just behind the head and steering with your feet. What use this is to an LA studio boss, or Wall Street banker, remains a mystery. First to our room, which is most definitely not a normal tent; it&apos;s a fixed wooden structure with the floor space of an average London flat. On three sides it can be opened to the elements by rolling back a thick shiny tarpaulin. There are 15 of these &apos;tents&apos; in a mile-long strip on a ridge above the Ruak river, a tributary of the Mekong. After 25 years of living in and travelling to the Far East, I&apos;m resolutely unfazed by new-style hotel rooms - but this time I am speechless. The outdoor, dinner-plate-sized shower head and vast terrace with twin massage tables are more or less expected. But a freestanding Victorian-repro bath in ochre resin with a brass elephant&apos;s trunk tap, cow-horn light pulls and a terracotta leather writing desk? That&apos;s gloriously OTT. Our oversized bed is draped in more white muslin than a bridal department. To keep us cosy at night we have wool throws, central heating, hot water bottles and ankle-length robes. The inclusive mini-bar is stacked with wines, half-bottles of spirits and snacks. We even have ready-stamped postcards.  Concerns about what this all costs are forgotten once you meet the elephants and learn that the three young pachyderms who join guests for breakfast have been rescued by the hotel from a miserable life on the streets of Bangkok. These three, along with six riding elephants, lead a pampered life, with their own pool and all the bamboo they can eat. To be honest, I could just chill out in the tent, but elephant riding is the reason we are here and after much petting - elephants like being scratched and tickled, apparently - and feeding we are instructed in how to mount Kham-Moon and Thong-Kham, aged 58 and 45 respectively. From the ground, these gentle giants look at least three times higher than a horse, so how to get on? The hotel provides us with a tough, stylish, denim mahout suit with a sash, which we are instructed to tie tightly round our waists. The elephants bend a knee to act as a step and the mahouts, already on board, haul us on top using the sash. I can&apos;t remember anything more undignified. I glance at my husband, David, who has never even been on a horse, to see sheer terror. I&apos;m hardly happy. It&apos;s a long way down.  Still, our steeds are amazingly compliant as we attempt to steer with knee pressure and foot flicking on the ears, which we are assured they don&apos;t mind. We even manage a rudimentary slalom course and learn mahout commands such as &apos;how&apos;, which means stop, and &apos;sock&apos;, which puts them into reverse. Bonding with such a large creature is a wonderful experience but I can&apos;t conquer my fear of being so high up and am pleased when the lesson is over. That night we go to manager Jason Friedman&apos;s cocktail party. It&apos;s about a mile to the bar on a narrow path that involves crossing a wobbly suspension bridge, so heels are out. It&apos;s a long hike there and back for a pre-dinner drink. &apos;Our guests all love it,&apos; Jason insists. &apos;We had a 94-year-old woman here recently who was determined to ride the elephants.&apos; I feel a bit pathetic, but it doesn&apos;t stop me comparing muscle pains with two Californian couples. As there are only six of us in camp, we share a table for dinner. We ditch the menu, as the chef promises a delicious jumble of Thai and Western dishes that include Tasmanian salmon sashimi, red duck curry and melting beef fillet. After far too much wine and shared travellers&apos; tales, I ask my husband if he can find a fault with the camp experience. &apos;Only one,&apos; he replies, and explains that earlier at the cocktail party he&apos;d discovered a large winged creature in his gin and tonic that had given him a nasty nip on the finger. &apos;Oh well,&apos; I say unsympathetically, &apos;you&apos;ve got to expect bugs when you&apos;re camping.&apos; Essentials Jill Hartley travelled with Kuoni World Class (01306 747008; www.kuoni.co.uk/worldclass), which tailor-makes holidays to the Far East.

The monks were also supported by two of the country&apos;s best-known celebrities, as speculation mounted that the British prime minister, Gordon Brown, will voice his support for the protests at the Labour party conference today. So far, the ruling military has shown unexpected restraint in its handling of the protests, which have entered their sixth day. Experts claim the rulers are under pressure from China, Burma&apos;s key trading partner, not to use heavy-handed tactics. The monks began today&apos;s protests with prayers at Rangoon&apos;s Shwedgaon pagoda, Burma&apos;s holiest Buddhist shrine. In the central city of Mandalay, up to 600 monks set off shortly after midday on their own protest march. The monks, who have taken over a faltering protest movement from political activists, have managed to bring people into the streets in numbers not seen since a 1988 pro-democracy uprising snuffed out by the army at a cost of thousands of lives. The protests began in August as a movement against economic hardship, after the government sharply raised fuel prices, increasing the overall cost of living. But arrests and intimidation kept demonstrations small and scattered until the monks entered the fray. The number of monks marching through Rangoon in the last six days has been matched or out-numbered by civilian supporters. Kyaw Thu, a popular actor, joined a comedian known as Zargana, in offering up food and water to monks gathered at the Shwedagon. &quot;We are Buddhist. All Buddhists have to support this movement,&quot; Kyaw Thu said. &quot;We will do whatever we have to do take care of the monks. They are doing a lot on behalf of the people.&quot; Mr Brown is believed to be poised to announce an aid package for Burma, and is said to be ready to back the protest at his speech to the Labour conference this afternoon. On Sunday, about 20,000 people, including thousands of monks, filled the streets in Rangoon and chanted support for the detained democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who stepped out to greet supporters a day earlier. The increasingly confrontational tone of the anti-government protesters has raised both expectations of possible political change and fear the military might forcefully stamp out the demonstrations, as it did in 1988. China has been putting pressure on the Burmese regime behind the scenes to move toward democracy and speed up reform. A Burmese expert, Josef Silverstein, said it would not be in China&apos;s interest to have civil unrest in Burma. &quot;China is very eager to have a peaceful Burma in order to complete roads and railroads, to develop mines and finish assimilating the country under its economic control,&quot; he told Associated Press. &quot;As long as there is war or potential for war, that doesn&apos;t serve China&apos;s interest at all.&quot; Larry Jagan, a Bangkok-based analyst, said: &quot;The Chinese, the Indians, the (south-east Asian countries) are not going to be prepared to see civilians shot mercilessly by soldiers.&quot; The protest movement intensified on Saturday, when more than 500 monks and sympathisers went past barricades to walk to the house where Ms Suu Kyi is under house arrest.

The monks are again chanting for democracy but the number protesting is &quot;well below&quot; yesterday and Monday, Zinith says. 10am Two witnesses saw the bloodied body of a monk being carried in Rangoon says Reuters. Mizzima reports actions against bloggers. It reckons the authorities have reduced the speed of internet connections, amid reports that internet cafes have been shut down.   10.10am The number of arrests has grown to 300, Associated Press reports. But protesters&apos; defiance also appears to be rising - there are now 10,000 demonstrators, AP says. Mark Farmaner, director of the Burma Campaign UK, told BBC News 24 that the military appear to be trying to prevent monks leaving their monasteries.    10.20am Human Rights Watch has urged Burma&apos;s allies (China, Thailand, India, and Russia) to use their influence to prevent more bloodshed in Burma. 10.30am The army is sending in reinforcements, eyewitnesses tell Mizzima. It is difficult for the Burmese authorities to hide repression in this &quot;era of openness&quot;, foreign secretary David Miliband told Sky News. &quot;The view of the world matters,&quot; he added and claimed that the authorities would be held to account.

His translation from Soneseayar says: &quot;At the juncture of 35t Street and 80th Streettear gas and guns were started to be fired. Now protesters are running to Payagyi (Mahamuni pagoda).

It also claims they were bystanders. &quot; the patient r not in d line of protest... they ( victims ) are just chatting and watching d protest line and sitting on Cafe Bar near Shawe Dagon Pagoda , some r pedestrians&quot;  3pm Associated Press says between three and five protesters were killed today, but it points out that none of the reported deaths can be independently verified. Times of India says four were killed and 100 injured.   3.15pm The military authorities have conceded that one person has been killed.   3.25pm The new curfew seems to be being observed, according to the Democratic Voice of Burma. It claims that the protesters dispersed independently of the show of military force. It said: &quot;As a result of the demonstrations, shops and government offices were shut down at around 2pm, and all government employees sent home. Schools were also ordered to close. Rangoon&apos;s state-run radio station, City FM, broadcast regular announcements of an extended curfew in place from 6pm to 6am.&quot; 4.05pm Just hours before a UN meeting on Burma, Russia said that international pressure against the military rulers would be &quot;counterproductive.&quot; But a joint statement from the US and European Union calls for UN sanctions against Burma. &quot;We call on the Security Council to discuss this situation urgently and to consider further steps including sanctions,&quot; the statement said.", "publicationDate": "2007-09-26T07:15:27Z", "tags": ["World news", "Protest"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2007/sep/26/burmaprotestswednesday", "title": "Burma protests: Wednesday", "sentences": ["Zinith Zin, a Burmese blogger on Bangkok site, says some people fell to the ground when shots were fired."]}, {"article": "Pro-democracy demonstrators continue to defy the authorities in Burma for an 11th consecutive day. At least one shot was fired as soldiers charged chanting protesters, a witness has told Reuters. The regime appears to be attempting to shut down internet access. There have been reports of infighting among the army.   Scroll down and refresh for updates, reaction, and your chance to comment. 8.30am (BST) The deaths of at least nine people yesterday has done little to snuff out the flames of protest as demonstrators take to the streets of Rangoon for an 11th consecutive day. People are hurling abuse at the army, Reuters wire service reports, in the city centre and taking refuge in side alleys as troops feign charges. Men were shouting at the soldiers in English:   &quot;Fuck you. Go fuck yourself.&quot;  Trucks of soldiers and riot police have been sealing off the centre of the city, near the Sule Pagoda area, Reuters says, moving wooden and barbed-wire barricades block by block.  9am The Associated Press is reporting that troops have occupied key Buddhist monasteries to confine monks. A British journalist, Rosalind Russel, who is in Burma, has told Sky News that there is speculation that the monks may no longer be there. There are reports that they have been bused out of the city. The authorities also appear to have taken measures to cut Burma&apos;s internet connection with the outside world.  &quot;We have been told that the internet is down for maintenance. There is only one server in the country so when it the internet cannot be accessed,&quot; Rosalind said. 9.05am At least one shot was fired as soldiers charged chanting protesters in central Rangoon today, sending people scurrying for cover down side alleys, a witness has told Reuters. Crowds several hundred strong were taunting soldiers sealing off the area around the Sule Pagoda. 9.20am A different view comes from Andrew Kirkwood who is in Rangoon for Save the Children. He told Sky News that his office is about a mile from the Shwedagon pagoda and has not seen any signs of widspread protests.  &quot;Buses are running and schools are open. Outside of these so-called danger zones, life continues relatively normally.&quot; He confirmed that internet and email access went down at around 10.30am (5amBST) and haven&apos;t been restored. 10am Guardian Unlimited reported yesterday that elements within the Burmese army appeared to be siding with the protesting monks. Today there are reports, picked up by moeyyo.com, that one section of the military is fighting another. According to the unconfirmed reports:  Soldiers between Light Battalion 33 and 99 are fighting.    10.30am Preetam Rai writes that the 33 batalion allowed monks to continue their protests in Mandalay, Burma&apos;s second city, yesterday. That may provide a clue to what&apos;s behind the reported fighting between the 33 and 99. I&apos;ve yet to see reports of any army casualties or hear how widespread army disquiet might be - do let me know if you&apos;re aware of any details. 11am The Thai government, which has kept quiet in recent days about the problems in neighbouring Burma, is coming under pressure to take a stance, the Bangkok Post reports. Laddawan Tantiwittayapitak, of Amnesty International Thailand and the Campaign for Democracy in Burma, called on the Thai government to suspended the construction of a hydropower dam and a gas purchase contract.  11.15am Here&apos;s a taste of what Niknayman is reporting (the times are local, 5hrs30mins ahead of BST and the text has been translated for GU by Mai Aung): 8:56: According to an eye witness, last night at South Ukkalapa, young and middle age men including monks were arrested and taken away with 37 trucks. 8:57: Last night, the abbot Moe Kaung Sayadaw of Yankin monastery passed away because of violent raid happened at the monastery. 9:04: Last night, 300 monks from Daw pone were arrested. 9:18: Division 33 army force refused to shoot the people in Mandalay. The government ordered Division. 33 to move out of Mandalay but they refused to follow the order. 9:29: The soldiers traced the media people. Yesterday the computers at Traders Hotel and Sakura Hotle were checked by soldiers. 11:45: Last night 40 monks were arrested in Mandalay. 11:50: About ten thousand people gathered near Traders hotel in downtown Rangoon. 12:00: started shooting at North Ukkalapa. 12:49: As division 33 did not follow the order, the government sent division 99 by airplane to Yangon. 12:55: about 50,000 gathered at Thein Gyi Zay (market). 12:56: Division 66 in North Ukkalapa teamed up with the people. 13:01: There was confrontation and clash between Division 33 and Division 99 13:13: About 10,000 people are gathering at Sanpya market. 14:35: At Anawratha street in downtown, people and soldiers got into brawl and now shooting started at Sanpya market.  14:36: Soldiers beaten the teachers in North Ukkalapa who organized the crowd for demonstration.  15:01: It is hard to communicate now as some of the telephone lines were cut off.  11.30am Australia&apos;s ambassador to Burma, Bob Davis, has told ABC (mp3) that a &quot;signifantly&quot; larger number of people had been killed than the 10 acknowledged by the Burmese authoritities. He said the real number of those killed in yesterday&apos;s violence was likely to be &quot;several multiples of 10&quot;.  The regime has done nothing other than to inflame the demonstrators. The violence against the crowds and assaults of a large number of monastries, severe beatings of monks and arrests of hundreds of monks ... has done nothing other than isolate some of the communities of monks ... It is very tense.  12.15pm The Burma Facebook group, which now has close to 90,000 members, is developing into a self-contained Wiki with details about global protests and Burmese media lists.  12.45pm Thanks to Chisinthemorning for the comment below linking to the Democratic Voice of Burma account of locals defending monasteries against army raids.  Troops approaching the monasteries backed off after seeing people from the surrounding areas armed with sticks and slingshots preparing to stop them.  1.15pm We&apos;ve updated our interactive of events in Burma, by the way. The bloggers are struggling to get their message out today, following the attempts to close down the internet. Ko Htike, based in London, however, says he is determined to feed pictures of events to the outside world.   2.30pm Some more translation from Niknaynam, courtesy of Mai Aung: 16:30: In Mandalay there are more than 100, 000 and military stepped back. No gun shots yet. 16:42: According eye witnesses, there were pools of blood in Pansodan street. The person must be beaten by an iron bar.  16:47: Latest news: ICRC (International Committee of Red Cross) took to the streets to help the injured. 17:05: In Mandalay, 30,000 people joined 200 monks that are protesting at 31 street. Soldiers begged the monks to go back to monasteries.  18:22: Police station at South Ukkalapa was burnt down.  A woman interviewed by Sky News has suggested the deathtoll among monks is close to 200. That is consistent with the number being given by the Facebook group. It is not yet clear, however, where these reports are coming from or what they are based upon.   2.45pm Japan&apos;s prime minister Yasuo Fukuda today demanded that Burmese authorities give a full explanation of the shooting dead of a Japanese journalist during protests yesterday. I&apos;ve been looking at a video which appears to show the moment the journalist was shot. Even at slow motion and under zoom, it&apos;s not clear cut - to me at any rate - whether the killer is the soldier closest to the journalist or whether the shot is fired from further away. Not that that changes the fact that he was shot dead. 3pm A Japanese news channel has secured footage of the shooting from a different angle. The soldier closest to the victim does appear to have fired the shot. 3.15pm While the protests continue, it appears the Burmese prime minister, Soe Win, could still be in hospital in Singapore. According to the Straight Times - spotted by Kadaung, AFP reporters made an attempt to track him down.  When an AFP reporter visited the four-bed VIP room where he was listed as staying, a nurse said Soe Win was not there. A board showed the names of patients in the room, but all were Chinese. One bed was sealed off with a curtain.  The BBC reported in March that the prime minister was admitted into hospital, possibly suffering from leukaemia. 4pm Reuters is suggesting a series of scenarios of how the situation in Burma may play out over the coming days, ranging from a military crackdown to people power toppling the junta ... or something in between. 4.15pm The Irrawaddy is suggesting that the army disquiet about how to handle the protests goes right to the top.  Unconfirmed reports say there are unusual troop movements underway in Rangoon, amid reports that Snr-Gen Than Shwe, the junta&apos;s chief, and Vice Snr-Gen Maung Aye, his second in command and the commander in chief of the army, have disagreed over the response to the recent demonstrations.  Maung Aye is planning to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi and is disturbed by the bloody crackdown, diplomatic sources have told the Irrawaddy. It adds that Suu Kyi has been taken to Yemon Military Camp on the outskirts of Rangoon. 5pm We&apos;re well into the curfew now so things should be quiet theoretically, but our translator Mai has just sent this through. 21.01: At this time, the military are coming to seal the Barkayar and the Aung Mingalar monasteries. 21.02: One Singaporean was injured by rubber bullets. 21.29: Soldiers are raiding the monasteries and have started shooting onlookers. 5.30pm Mizzima News carries more details about the apparent rift between the junta chief Than Shwe and his second in command Maung Aye. &quot;Maung Aye and his loyalists are opposed to shooting into the crowd,&quot; a source close to the military hierarchy told Mizzima.", "publicationDate": "2007-09-28T07:27:07Z", "tags": ["World news", "Protest"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2007/sep/28/burmaprotestsfriday", "title": "Burma protests: Friday", "sentences": ["11am The Thai government, which has kept quiet in recent days about the problems in neighbouring Burma, is coming under pressure to take a stance, the Bangkok Post reports."]}, {"article": "The Burmese government apparently cut internet access today in an attempt to staunch the flow of pictures and messages from protesters reaching the outside world. An official told the Agence France-Presse news agency that the internet &quot;is not working because the underwater cable is damaged&quot;. In Bangkok, in neighbouring Thailand, an official at a telecommunications firm that provides satellite services to Burma said some internet service inside the country had been cut. The London-based blogger Ko Htike said: &quot;I sadly announce that the Burmese military junta has cut off the internet connection throughout the country. I therefore would not be able to feed in pictures of the brutality by the brutal Burmese military junta.&quot; Mr Htike said he would try his best to feed the Burmese junta&apos;s &quot;demonic appetite of fear and paranoia by posting any pictures that I receive though other means ... I will continue to live with the motto that &apos;if there is a will there is a way&apos;.&quot; The US criticised the junta&apos;s move, with the White House spokesman, Scott Stanzel, saying: &quot;They don&apos;t want the world to see what is going on there.&quot;  Only 1% of the population in Burma has internet access, but protesters have managed to send out videos, photographs and messages to keep the outside world abreast of the dramatic events unfolding in Burma for the past week. Many images have been picked up by mainstream news organisations, because protesters have captured pictures that no one else has been able to, helping to fuel public outrage at the government&apos;s crackdown. When Burma&apos;s opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who is under house arrest in Rangoon, stepped outside her home to greet marching monks and supporters last week, the only pictures were posted on blogs and later picked up by news organisations. The Burmese junta has been caught unawares by the ingenuity of bloggers - mainly university students - who have been sending their material to Burmese exile websites in Thailand and India. But in recent days they have turned their attention to preventing material collected by protesters and dissidents from getting out, shutting down internet cafes and now allegedly cutting internet links with the outside world. Journalists from Reuters, the Associated Press and AFP are still continuing to operate in Burma. Even a partial internet shutdown in a country where service is sporadic at the best of times could reduce the number of photos and videos of the crackdown that have been transmitted. According to Reporters Without Borders, Burma ranks 164 out of 168 states on press freedom. The group says: &quot;The Burmese government&apos;s internet policies are even more repressive than those of its Chinese and Vietnamese neighbours ...

On one side: the wisdom and non-violent principles of over 2,500 years of Buddhist tradition. On the other: military might honed over 45 years of brutal authoritarian rule. The number of monks in Burma is estimated to be anywhere between 400,000 to 500,000. The number of soldiers is around 400,000. So, one monk for every soldier. When the monks began marching in peaceful protest over a week ago, the junta remained ominously silent. Then, on Tuesday, the crackdown began. An unconfirmed number of monks were shot dead, monasteries were raided and hundreds of monks have been imprisoned. How will the predominately Buddhist population of Burma respond to this attack on members of its revered religious order? With absolute horror, I imagine, as they have done to previous attacks (an unverified number of monks were shot dead during the nationwide uprising in 1988, and over 500 were imprisoned). But people&apos;s reactions will probably be expressed behind closed doors. The regime has a terrifyingly effective network of spies and informers, and people are often not willing to openly voice any criticism of the regime for fear of imprisonment and torture. The surveillance has been so insidious that there are Burmese people I have met who do not trust anyone outside their immediate family; they won&apos;t talk openly to cousins or close friends. When I asked a friend for advice on how to safely do research in Burma, he told me to operate under the assumption that everyone I met was an informer - including him. After the events of 1988, the regime began to eliminate all possible means of dissent within the country. The student community, which had led and organised the demonstrations, was politically emasculated. Through surveillance and intimidation, the regime managed to create a country in which there is no social or political space for people to gather or organise in big numbers. Many Burma watchers, myself included, thought that protests of the kind which took place in 1988 couldn&apos;t happen again as there is seemingly no way to gain a critical mass within such an oppressive environment. And yet, over the past fortnight, the monks have risen up in numbers it would have been impossible to imagine just a few weeks ago. They are being led by the Alliance of All Burmese Buddhist Monks, an organisation that must have been operating deeply underground as few people had ever heard of them before last week. Many of my Burmese friends are unsurprised by surprising events such as this. One friend always travels prepared for any eventuality; he sits bolt upright throughout overnight train journeys with his belongings clasped in his lap, just in case. When I ask his opinion on future events, he squints his eyes with theatrical aplomb and says, &quot;In Burma, anything can happen.&quot; Somewhere within that &quot;anything&quot; is the possibility of a mutiny within the army. For many soldiers, being ordered to shoot or beat up a monk goes against every grain of their spiritual up-bringing, and ensures they will carry the burden of bad karma for life-times to come. And the lower-ranking soldiers share certain similarities with the rest of the population: they, too, are poor, badly treated and afraid. I used to see soldiers living in the crumbling outbuildings of the old British Secretariat, the regime&apos;s main ministerial building until it moved to its new capital. In the centre of Rangoon, these poorly-paid soldiers had to use kerosene lamps and cook over camp-fires as if they were in the jungle. One of the many rumours to emerge from Burma over the past couple days is that there may be a split in the army. Troops from central Burma are said to be marching towards Rangoon. Some say they are coming to challenge the soldiers who are attacking monks; others say they are coming to reinforce them. Whether these rumours are true or not, they are often accurate barometers of people&apos;s hopes and fears: Will they free us, or will they crush us? If the army succeeds in crushing this uprising - which, so far, it seems to be doing - then the regime will set to work purging the monastic order of what it likes to call &quot;destructive elements&quot; and even more monks will be imprisoned and tortured. The regime&apos;s intelligence agents will shave their heads and infiltrate the monasteries, praying among the monks as one of them. What little space for political organisation once existed within the monkhood will be obliterated. Yet another attempt by the people to speak out about their suffering will have been silenced. So how will the Burmese people respond to soldiers aiming their guns at unarmed monks? How can they respond? If they are able to push aside a lifetime of oppression and fear, they can make martyrs of themselves and walk out into the street towards the guns. And the monks could do the same - if they are still able to mass themselves - there is, after all, at least one monk for every soldier willing to shoot him. \u00b7 Emma Larkin is the author of Secret Histories: Finding George Orwell in a Burmese Teashop, published by John Murray.

Communication to the outside world has been largely cut and, according to diplomats in the region, up to 200 protesters are dead. The official death count from the government is nine. But no one believes the government. The maroon-clad Buddhist monks from the monasteries at Moe Gaung, Ngwe Kyar Yan and elsewhere, who marched in their thousands to give impetus to a new generation of Burmese protesters challenging decades of military rule, are locked up in prison or behind their monastery gates. Their monks&apos; cells have been smashed, stained with their blood and looted. Those who escaped have taken off their robes and sought refuge disguised as laymen. Parks, grocery stores and internet cafes are closed. Troops stand on every corner. By late yesterday a few hundred protesters - in contrast to the hundreds of thousands who flocked to the streets mid-week - were playing a game of cat- and-mouse with the military and pro-military thugs. For now it has been left to a United Nations envoy, Ibrahim Gambari, to persuade the generals to use negotiations instead of guns to end mass protests against 45 years of military rule. &apos;He&apos;s the best hope we have. He is trusted on both sides,&apos; Singapore Foreign Minister George Yeo said. &apos;If he fails, then the situation can become quite dreadful.&apos; It was a sense of despair that was reflected yesterday in Rangoon, the country&apos;s largest city and centre of gravity of the protests, which have faltered and failed under a hail of rubber bullets, tear gas and live rounds. &apos;I don&apos;t think that we have any more hope to win,&apos; said a young woman who took part in a massive demonstration on Thursday that was broken up when troops opened fire into a crowd. She was separated from her boyfriend and has not seen him since. &apos;The monks are the ones who give us courage.&apos; &apos;People are living in a state of fear and hate,&apos; said another onlooker. &apos;A few days ago, everyone was friendly. Now no one wants to talk to strangers.&apos; But, perhaps, it is not the whole picture. For in Burma in these past two weeks of protests, two stories have emerged. The first has been sharply visible in the images of the vast demonstrations against the military junta that have coalesced around Rangoon&apos;s symbolic centres of the Sule and Shwedagon pagodas, and the violent response of the regime. It has been told in pictures of bloodshed and confrontation that have brought back bleak memories of the last time the Burmese people rose up to confront the military who have exercised a brutal monopoly on power for 45 long years. That was in 1988, when 3,000 people were murdered by the army in the violence that followed. Most of all it has been a story of resistance that yesterday appeared to have concluded in defeat. But there has been a second, more discreet story that has emerged. The most powerful weapons in the revolution, albeit one that has been crushed for now, were the worldwide web, Facebook and the blogs - in particular, those that fed the Burmese media network in Oslo that fed the world. With the internet in Burma largely closed down, as activists in Norway concede, the powerful images that commanded the world&apos;s attention have become scraps of just a few seconds. Still, the story has seeped out via hurried conversations in Rangoon and Mandalay, passed down the line to opposition groups in exile in Bangkok and on the Thai border. And what it has described is a sclerotic military regime that, while still brutal and controlling, has been struggling to impose the power it has for so long enjoyed. It tells for the first time of cracks in the military command, of officers questioning the &apos;morality&apos; of their orders and the self-interest of the generals in charge. &apos;There are differences in the rank and file of the army for the first time,&apos; said one exiled trade union activist last week. They are focused, too, on tensions within an army and bureaucracy that has long shared the financial fruits of power with the junta&apos;s generals and who, after four decades, have begun to feel as excluded as the vast majority of Burma&apos;s people. When Senior General Than Shwe began the relocation of Burma&apos;s administrative capital to Naypyidaw - the &apos;Abode of the Gods&apos; - in November 2005 the move was put down by some to folly and superstition. The reality, however, of the relocation of Burma&apos;s ministries and military headquarters to this area of tropical scrub, 200 miles distant from Rangoon, was more prosaic. A military dictatorship once confident of its ability to frighten the population had, in fact, become something close to being afraid itself, of its own people. It was a time of transformation in Burma - of changes that in large measure would lead directly to the showdown between the military and the Burmese people that began in the middle of August. For there were consequences to the move that the generals could have anticipated. Transferring the entire government machinery to Naypyidaw has been a huge drain on public finances already stretched to breaking point in one of the world&apos;s poorest countries. So, too, has been the cost of maintaining the 375,000-strong army, which has nearly doubled in size over the past decade. The folly of the move to Naypyidaw has impoverished an already poor population in a land where government pensions are virtually worthless. One of the critical engines of the protests has been the cost of living. The move had other critical consequences. For as well as seeing the centre of power being shifted away, the centre of gravity within the regime was also being shunted. &apos;The junta used to be a dictatorship by committee,&apos; says Mark Farmaner of the Burma Campaign UK. &apos;But around the same time as the move it began to become more of a traditional dictatorship centred around General Than Shwe. The military intelligence chief, General Khin Nyunt, was put under house arrest, and the balance of power with Vice Senior General Maung Aye that existed between the three generals began evolving around 2004 into the accumulation by Than Shwe of more power for himself and a few cronies.&apos; The shift in power within Burma&apos;s junta was reflected in another important aspect, according to opposition figures in the Burmese government in exile. Where once the generals had been careful to command the loyalty of the military by distributing the benefits of dictatorship among them, Than Shwe began concentrating the benefits of power in the same tight circle. And if a symbol for the physical remoteness and greed of the evolving new regime under Than Shwe was required, it was supplied in a desperately miscalculated act: the wedding in Rangoon last year of his daughter, a 10-minute video of which was leaked to the outside world. Viewers were offended not only by the extravagance of the event, in which Thandar Shwe and her bridegroom, Major Zaw Phyo Win, a deputy director at the Ministry of Commerce, were showered with expensive gifts, including luxury cars, houses and jewellery, but also by its utter lack of taste. It was not simply the widely claimed $50m in gifts lavished on the bride that was symbolic. The diabetic Than Shwe, then 75, looked frail. Less visible things were happening to the regime as it settled into its new headquarters. Reports of desertions from a military no longer an elite apart began to emerge; a report leaked to Jane&apos;s suggested that many of its battalions were suffering manpower problems. Persistent reports began to emerge of criticism of the leadership even among the officer classes. &apos;There was a lieutenant-colonel out of the country who said the Americans should bomb Naypyidaw,&apos; recalls Zaw Tung, an official with the Federation of Trade Unions of Burma, which was among the organisers of the recent protests and a victim of the crackdown. Signs of dissent within the military have also been reported by Zin Lin, an official with the Burmese government in exile. &apos;We have heard reports from inside the country of places where soldiers are not following orders to fire on demonstrators, including in Mandalay where they refused an order to fire on monks.&apos; But there are more intriguing claims emerging that appear to contradict the narrative of the democracy movement being snuffed out without any gain in the last few days. Among them is the claim in Irrawaddy news magazine that the bubbling dissent within the armed forces has led to a serious falling out between the head of the army, Vice Senior General Maung Aye, and Than Shwe over the response to the demonstrations. Farmaner&apos;s organisation has heard the same accounts. And if he is certain of one thing, it is that Than Shwe, secluded in his new capital, made a series of potentially disastrous miscalculations, beginning with the decision to increase the price of fuel by 500 per cent, leading to the first demonstration on 19 August. By the junta&apos;s own standards, it seemed slow and confused about how to respond to the fuel protests and then to the mass revulsion that followed the beating of two monks by the security forces. When it did use violence last week, to close the huge monasteries in Rangoon that had become the focus of the protests, arresting and beating hundreds of monks and looting property, it was in a way certain to alienate many who had not marched but stood on the sidelines in this devoutly Buddhist country. &apos;There seems to have been a massive series of miscalculations,&apos; says Farmaner. &apos;They did not anticipate how unpopular the increase in the fuel price would be.&apos; He added: &apos;The junta relies on its psychological grip on the population. It requires people to be afraid. But people kept coming out day after day. You can say that its grip is lessening.&apos; The junta has miscalculated in other ways as well. Although China last week blocked a strong resolution at the UN, it has made unusually strong remarks - strong by its diplomatic standards, that is, that have criticised its ally, perhaps mindful that in the year ahead of the Beijing Olympics it does not want to be seen as party to widespread bloodshed. The Asean nations, not prone to condemning their own over human rights abuses, have spoken of their &apos;revulsion&apos;, while Japan, the biggest donor of humanitarian aid to Burma, has also apparently been galvanised against the regime after the death of a Japanese photographer. And while the junta has long ignored the condemnation of Washington and European capitals, and has survived under sanctions similar to President George Bush&apos;s new travel ban on 30 senior Burmese figures, it seems certain that local considerations will weigh more heavily. What will be most critical will be the attitude of China. For what seems important is not that China has moved slowly but that China has moved at all. On Friday, Gordon Brown telephoned his Chinese counterpart, Wen Jiabao, to ask Beijing to use its influence to prevent further bloodshed. The previous day, Mr Bush conveyed a similar message in a meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Yang Jiechi. US State Department officials, it has been claimed, have privately asked China to provide a safe haven for the junta to allow progress towards a peaceful political transition. China supplies arms to Burma, part of the $1.3bn in goods it exported to its neighbour last year. China is also the main supplier of foreign goods, accounting for 34 per cent of Burma&apos;s imports. Hopes for a positive response are based on Beijing&apos;s increasingly pro-active diplomatic policy, despite usually preferring not to interfere in the affairs of other nations. There are other internal risks for the Burmese regime. Armed ethnic groups that had been on ceasefire have been outraged by the violence last week and are angry at the junta&apos;s continued intransigence in pushing forward a new constitution that has ignored their demands. So while the junta may have won for now, quite what the terms and scope of its victory are remain unclear. &apos;A Burmese said to me once that his country was hard on the outside and soft in the middle,&apos; says Farmaner. &apos;I always thought if the junta was going to go it would be like one of the Eastern European ones, imploding rather than reforming itself away.&apos; This weekend the Burmese junta does not seem necessarily stronger, only more desperate. How it started 5 August: Fuel prices rise 19 August: First protest marches in Rangoon - several dissidents arrested 21 September: Alliance of All Burmese Buddhist Monks emerges to co-ordinate the protests 22 September: Monks let through the barricades around the home of Aung San Suu Kyi 24 September: Tens of thousands march on Rangoon. Violent clashes as protesters are set upon by police. At least three deaths 25 September: Dusk-to-dawn curfew introduced 26 September: UN urges restraint by the junta after an emergency session, in which China vetoed sanctions 27 September: At least nine are shot dead in Rangoon 28 September: Special UN envoy arrives in Rangoon Key questions Q: Why do some people call it Burma and others Myanmar? A: The ruling military junta changed the name from Burma to Myanmar in 1989, a year after up to 5,000 were killed in the suppression of a popular uprising (triggered by the government&apos;s decision to devalue the currency). Many countries and the UN accepted the name change but the UK, and opposition groups inside and outside Burma, don&apos;t recognise the legitimacy of the regime that changed the name. Q: What sparked the protests? A: On 15 August the government doubled the price of petrol and diesel, while the cost of compressed gas - used in buses - increased fivefold. It hit people hard, pushing up the cost of public transport, rice and cooking oil. Angry pro-democracy activists led the first demonstrations in Rangoon on 19 August and soon marches were being organised in several towns around the country. Q: How did Buddhist monks get involved? A: The clergy has traditionally been involved in protest movements - one of Burma&apos;s most revered historical leaders was a monk. Soldiers broke up a peaceful demo in Pakokku on 5 September, injuring three monks. The monks gave the government until 17 September to apologise and then began to protest in much greater numbers. Q: Who is Aung San Suu Kyi? A: The 62-year-old leader of the opposition National League for Democracy, which won the 1990 election by a landslide; she has spent more than 11 of the past 18 years in some form of detention. Presently under house arrest, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.

We just don&apos;t have the knack. We had one good one, early on, but that was a fluke. Everything since then has been a nightmare. You know the bit in Withnail and I when they run up to the farmer and shout, &quot;Help us! We&apos;ve come on holiday by mistake!&quot;? I used to think that was pretty funny. These days? Not so much. Once we left the house thinking we were going to Bali, and ended up in the Philippines (long story). We had to wait nine hours for a connecting flight in Bangkok airport. The wait wasn&apos;t so bad. Sure, it was a little long, but at least there was nowhere to sleep. That&apos;s what made it really perfect. We arrived in Manila feeling like the airport dirt under our nails. Still, we reminded each other, just one more plane ride to the island and it&apos;s all roses. On each of our seats on the tiny propeller plane there was a slip of paper. I picked it up idly, gave my wife&apos;s hand a reassuring squeeze and started to read. It might help to imagine the following in a florid, italicised font on thick, expensive paper. GREETINGS! If you are reading this, then you are on one of our daily flights from Manila airport to our wonderful island paradise, where powder-white sands meet turquoise seas and tropical palms sway across clear azure skies . . . beauty and tranquility in equal measure. Soon, you will embark on the holiday of a lifetime thanks to our comfortable villas, thoughtful staff and such features as our famous three-tiered swimming pool. As you look out of the airplane window, you will see the many neighbouring islands, arranged roughly in a crescent shape, that give them the collective name &quot;Tisno Mai&quot;. Literally, &quot;Heaven&apos;s Smile&quot;. When you land, you will be escorted to your private chalet. Take some time to get freshened up, then head on over to the Clubhouse Restaurant for a glass of champagne before dinner. A WORD ON &quot;NIK-NIKS&quot; Sadly, our island paradise does, like everywhere else, have its share of nuisances. Ours come in the form of tiny insects known to the locals as &quot;Nik-Niks&quot;. Scattered around your chalet you will find bottles of spray that are a very effective deterrent against the tiny creatures. Hate the smell? So do they! Nik-Niks thrive in damp, watery areas, so you only have to exercise caution by the pool, on the beach, in your bathroom and while sweating. Luckily, too, Nik-Niks have what is called an inert period, so midday to 12.45 is almost entirely Nik-Nik free (that is when you will see our cleaning and maintenance staff doing much of their work). This would be an ideal time to take a stroll on the beach, enjoy a quick dip, get some snacks from the snack bar, run back to your chalet, have a bath and then put on your Nik-Nik spray. Nik-Niks are extremely tiny. The smallest are invisible to the naked eye, the largest no bigger than a kitten. During the day they buzz about furiously, making a tremendous noise that the locals call &quot;Mitiki Fa&quot; (literally &quot;the crazy sound&quot;), but it&apos;s at night that they really come alive, and many of our residents prefer to make use of our excellent room service at this time. Like most disease-carrying creatures, Nik-Niks need a steady surface area before they can use their needle-tipped proboscis effectively, so try to keep moving (especially by the beach, by the pool or in your bathroom). In the unlikely event that you are bitten, simply keep the infected area as far away from the rest of your body as possible and lie down. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO REMAIN CALM AT THIS STAGE. Remember this simple rhyme: &quot;When I scream and stamp around, I move the infected blood around.&quot; Keep repeating this until the air ambulance arrives. (As a side note, when the air ambulance arrives, DO NOT PAY THE PILOT, NO MATTER WHAT HE SAYS!) Do not scratch the infected area. You will want to scratch it, but you must resist doing so at all costs. Even now, reading this, you probably want to scratch the area, even though, as yet, you have not been bitten. Around now, you should be hearing a rattling sound. Don&apos;t worry! It&apos;s just the first cloud of Nik-Niks hitting the cockpit window as we come in to land. I&apos;m recounting it from memory, but this isn&apos;t a million miles off. When we arrived on the island, we couldn&apos;t see the waiting staff through the rain, and the next morning, there were great puddles of tepid water everywhere. We imagined the Nik-Niks hovering over them like thought-balloons; thought balloons that were thinking, &quot;We are going to bite your arses off.&quot; We did our best to avoid them. In the end, it wasn&apos;t so bad. But it was that moment in the plane, reading that slip of paper that remains with me. After three plane flights and no sleep, it felt like being mugged. &quot;Excuse me. We&apos;ve come on holiday by mistake.&quot; As I say, hilarious. \u00b7 Charlie Brooker is away.

Street food vendors across the city have lined up to compete. They consist of (drum roll, please) ...  Now this is where I draw a blank. Markets aside, does London have a street food scene? All that springs to mind for me are those late-night, Tube-front hotdog vendors (who hope sheer volume of onions will mask their less-than-prime meat) and a mobile coffee stand in Liverpool Street called Mr Coffee that my brother swears by.  Neither is likely to win awards. (Sorry Mr Coffee - although your tagline, &quot;Mr Coffee, he&apos;s so frothy&quot;, should surely win a prize of some sort.)  So why such a shortage? Are our boroughs stricter when it comes to dolling out licences?  &quot;It&apos;s actually quite easy to get a licence,&quot; a spokesperson for London Councils tells me. &quot;In theory, you just need to apply and be prepared for inspections. The difficulty, however, lies in getting a pitch.&quot; This is where prospective traders place their fate in the hands of Transport for London and local authorities. Some, such as Southwark, seem to prefer to concentrate vendors together in designated areas to cut down on &quot;obstructions for pedestrians&quot;, &quot;unfair competition&quot; and safety risks. &quot;Unlicensed traders almost always sell illegal goods of dubious quality,&quot; they warn.  One writer on British Chinese website Dim Sum admits to being &quot;empty and a bit down&quot; on return to London after sampling the delights found on the streets of Tapei, Kuala Lumpar and Bangkok. They do, however, find solace at Borough Market.  Now, if you&apos;re willing to enter market stalls into the fray (and why not?), then that&apos;s a different story. Londoners will have countless recommendations, as demonstrated in a recent discussion on foodie forum Chowhound.  One chow-loving poster muses on whether the Bagel Bake on Brick Lane counts because you eat on the street. As good as his favourites (salt beef and chopped herring) may be, that&apos;s quite a long shot. Do we really have to widen the field that much?

A pleasing crunch on a prawn cracker daubed with this traditional concoction of chillies, garlic and shrimp paste and then ... Ddduuoofff! Arrrrghhh! I imagine that will be the charred extra-hot bird&apos;s eye chillies. Londoners experienced this fiery glory in cloud form earlier this week when the chef at Thai Cottage in Soho began dry-frying 9lbs of hot chillies for the sauce. The scent of frying chillies rose out of the ventilation shaft in Wasboonma&apos;s small family-run restaurant before overcast conditions caused a toxic-looking chilli cloud to descend on a nearby street market. Shoppers spluttered and, fearing some kind of chemical attack or leak, police sealed off three roads and evacuated homes and businesses. Three hours later, firefighters in breathing apparatus eventually traced the source of the cloud, smashing down the door of the (evacuated) restaurant to liberate the offending batch of nam prik pao. &quot;It&apos;s very famous. Everyone knows this kind of dip in Thailand,&quot; says Wasboonma, as she serves me a generous dollop from her latest batch. (Wasboonma, her husband and nephew are proud to make fresh sauces in their own kitchen rather than importing them from Bangkok.) &quot;But it&apos;s not the hottest.&quot; I&apos;m not sure I believe her. Tiny flakes of dark red chillies stick out menacingly from a coal-black paste of pure fire with the texture of caramelised onions. It looks like it could easily dissolve the prawn crackers but instead it has a go at my tongue. It tastes good - fresh and charred; the sort of chilli that has you frantically dialling 999 if you encounter a cloud of it on your way to the shops. And it is properly lip-singeing, nose-running, must-take-my-jacket-off-and-swallow-a-pint-of-water hot. Because I am there to suffer so you don&apos;t have to, I soldier on to sample the nefarious nam prik pao with an accompaniment of chicken satay, tom yam gung soup, gaeng phed ped yang and a beef massaman curry. It&apos;s delicious. Wasboonma has been cooking up her nam prik pao since she opened the little restaurant 15 years ago. Given that business has fallen a little since the 7/7 bomb attacks, she certainly does not want to cause any more alarm. &quot;Next time we will only cook a little bit so we don&apos;t scare everybody,&quot; she vows.", "publicationDate": "2007-10-03T23:14:27Z", "tags": ["Life and style", "Food & drink"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/oct/04/foodanddrink.patrickbarkham", "title": "Patrick Barkham talks to Sue Wasboonma about the chilli sauce that created an incident", "sentences": ["(Wasboonma, her husband and nephew are proud to make fresh sauces in their own kitchen rather than importing them from Bangkok.)"]}, {"article": "Reading Across Asia on the Cheap, the first guidebook that Tony and Maureen Wheeler wrote and the beginning of the empire that was to become Lonely Planet, I realise that there&apos;s only one place they write about that I&apos;d really like to see. And that&apos;s 1973. Forget the emerald Buddha in Bangkok, it&apos;s the &apos;freak bus services&apos; I want (operating from London to Istanbul for around $30), Kabul - that &apos;fly-in, fly-out tourist trap&apos; - and a Singapore that is &apos;a groovy place&apos;, where Tony - and it&apos;s worth bearing in mind that this is a hard-working young man fresh out of business school - advises passing through immigration wearing a &apos;short-hair wig&apos; and notes that as a modern city, it owes its existence to Sir Stamford Raffles &apos;who was quite a cat&apos;. It&apos;s a delightful read, in all sorts of ways. There are some ropey hand-drawn cartoons on the front and, at 94 pages, its coverage of half the world - everything that lies between London and Sydney - is perhaps best described as &apos;concise&apos;. Still, in Iran, we learn &apos;the Amir Kabir is the freak bottleneck and has been for some years&apos;, Iraq is simply &apos;a very hard-line socialist Arab country so watch what you say and never mention arch enemies, Iran or Israel&apos; and, comforting this for anyone who&apos;s ever been told they arrived too late, in 1973 Bali is already described as over: it &apos;shows every indication of being rapidly eroded by tourism&apos;, the guide says. &apos;Go soon.&apos; They simply don&apos;t make guidebooks like this any more: the sketchiest of practical information, some of it excitingly criminal - where to score drugs, how to obtain forged ID - artfully combined with frank admissions of total ignorance: &apos;I&apos;m not too hot on hotels in Iran&apos;. Plus an ever-ready willingness to air personal politics, &apos;due to the continuing effect of the American charade in South East Asia, travel to other south east Asian countries is either difficult, not recommended or impossible&apos;. But its canonical status is not because it was a helpful primer on the practicalities of overland travel, but as a generational call to arms. &apos;All you&apos;ve got to do is decide to go and the hardest part is over,&apos; said Tony Wheeler in his introduction. &apos;So go.&apos; And then, well, basically, everybody did, all of us, at one time or another, if not for six months on a hippy bus, then two weeks of island-hopping in Greece, as often as not with a Lonely Planet guidebook tucked into our rucksack. The Wheelers made the overland trip in 1972, arrived in Australia with less than a dollar, and so the story goes, banged out the book &apos;at their kitchen table&apos;. Last week, it bore ultimate fruition, when they sold a majority stake in the company to the BBC, netting them a reported \u00a363m. It&apos;s big money, but more than that, it&apos;s almost certainly the end of one era, and the beginning of another quite different one, although exactly what that might be, nobody&apos;s as yet quite sure. Just a few days before the Wheelers&apos; announcement, Mark Ellingham, the founder of Rough Guides, decided to step down from the company that he&apos;d created 25 years ago and subsequently sold to Penguin. And earlier this year, Hilary Bradt, of Bradt guides, retired, as did Charles James, of Vacation Work, both veteran independent publishers who also started out in the early Seventies. Year on year sales are down: by two per cent last year and a worsening plunge is feared this year. The coming age is of the downloadable pdf; the hand-held device; the guidebook that is tailor-made to fit your trip. The BBC deal is meant to provide the cash to facilitate this for Lonely Planet. It&apos;s just hard, looking at my copy of Across Asia on the Cheap, to think that this is where it all began: the ur-text of LP 3.0. Studying it, there are things that have changed beyond all imagining (RIP dear old poste restante) and yet there&apos;s also so much that&apos;s familiar here. The basic guidebook structure, the exhortations to watch for dodgy, foreign food, and, when visiting embassies, to look smart and behave yourself ( &apos;Just why are these countries so uptight? ... Do yourself and everyone else a favour and stay cool.&apos;) It&apos;s a legacy of Baedeker&apos;s improving Victorian stance, this tendency of guidebook writers to order you about. Oh, they can be such pompous know-it-alls! &apos;Before you even think about heading out into the hills alone, take advice ... ignore the counsel of well-meaning Beirutis and ask in the villages.&apos; Who wrote that? Oh, yes, that&apos;s right, it was me (Travellers&apos; Survival Kit Lebanon 1996, co-authored with my friend, Anna Sutton).&apos; It&apos;s so easy to be pompous. And so enjoyable. Particularly in a travelling context. In a nutshell: the past was better, you should have got there sooner, and you paid how much for it, you fool? If there&apos;s any area of modern life that has benefited from new technology and yet in which we resist the notion that it might possibly just be progress, it&apos;s travel. It&apos;s the prelapsarian ideal we want. No gift shops or touts. Just unsullied nature, and, now you mention it, a charming small hotel with crisp cotton sheets and maybe a nice glass of something chilled. It&apos;s an inconvenient fact that the good old days weren&apos;t always. My experience of backpacking in former Soviet hellholes would have been immeasurably transformed with the invention of Couchsurfing, and in the age of Google, Anna and I wouldn&apos;t have got away with our more creative touches. At work on a guidebook to Russia &amp; the Republics and at a loss as to how enliven a section on Minsk nightlife, we endowed our friend Isabel Henton with a set of pink performing poodles and made her the star of the Belarusian State Circus. There&apos;s not many jolly japes these days. But then there&apos;s also no detracting from Lonely Planet&apos;s extraordinary success: it publishes more than 500 titles, has sold 80 million guidebooks, translated into eight or more languages. On the wall of their London office is a framed certificate noting that they have been judged to be a &apos;Superbrand&apos; and so the story goes, when Bill Clinton went to visit Australia, he requested an audience with the Prime Minister, and &apos;someone from Lonely Planet&apos;. I haven&apos;t met Maureen but Tony is as mild-mannered and unassuming a multi-millionaire as you could hope to find. Everyone admires them and applauds their achievement. And yet I talk to Hilary Bradt and Mark Ellingham and Charles James, and Bryn Thomas from another small independent, Trailblazer, and James Daunt, of Daunt Books, a specialist travel bookshop, and nobody can resist putting the boot into Lonely Planet just a touch: it&apos;s travel publishing&apos;s Microsoft. When I ring Charles James, he tells me that, funnily enough, he&apos;s currently reading a book by Pete McCarthy, &apos;and every few pages, he goes and slags off Lonely Planet and all the sad Lonely Planeters hanging around the hostels, and of course, that delights me no end&apos;. &apos;I mean have you seen their first book? And ours too ... If you compare what they&apos;re doing now with the first books, there&apos;s no comparison. They&apos;re tremendously good these days whereas back then we had, what? 220 pages and a few scrappy hand-drawn maps? We sold them for \u00a35 which, bearing in mind, this was 30 years ago, was good money, and they just sold terrifically well because there was nothing else out there. For a while, it was absolutely brilliant.&apos; It was absolutely brilliant, I agree. He gave us a commissioning letter, a very small amount of cash, and off we went to Lebanon with carte blanche. On the telephone, Bryn Thomas tells me of his hell updating Lonely Planet India (&apos;up at dawn, five hotels before breakfast ...&apos;) and how curtailed the format was (&apos;it just wasn&apos;t much fun writing for them in the end, it was so controlled&apos;) whereas Anna and I swanned around with a Blue Guide from 1969, spending weeks tracking down lost temples on the sides of the Bekaa Valley, establishing exactly which was our favourite Beiruti felafel seller, turning up for coffee with Walid Jumblatt, the former warlord, and composing disquisitions on, among other things, the appearance of female newscasters on Hezbollah TV. It barely sold a copy, of course, what with some slightly bad timing with some rockets and the Israeli army. But still, as I always told Charles, minor quibbles, minor quibbles. Hilary Bradt, whose company concentrates on the more obscure destinations, published her first book in 1974, a year after the Wheelers did, although she wasn&apos;t even aware of the existence of their books at the time. There&apos;s no ignoring them now though. &apos;Everyone asks why we don&apos;t do a book on Thailand,&apos; she says. &apos;In order to have something concrete to say, I counted up the number of Thailand guides in Stanfords the other day, and do you know how many there were? Forty-two. And the world doesn&apos;t need 43 guides to Thailand, that&apos;s for sure.&apos; They&apos;re still finding destinations, she says, &apos;but if Lonely Planet comes along and does it, well, it doesn&apos;t matter that we have the better book, people just look at the brand. I think they&apos;ve done terrifically well, it&apos;s just hard as a small publisher not to resent it.&apos; Everybody has a tale to tell about Lonely Planet&apos;s quasi-mythical power. There&apos;s the apocryphal story, for example, about the Rainbow Lodge. Recommended by Lonely Planet, it boomed. The other guesthouse owners grew jealous. So one hotelier changed his name to Rainbow Lodge. Then another. Until there was a whole street of Rainbow Lodges and busloads of confused backpackers not knowing which way to turn. &apos;That&apos;s not apocryphal,&apos; Tony Wheeler says, when I ask him. &apos;That happens all the time. All over the place. They&apos;re always at it. There was one place in Hanoi where we recommended the Globetrekker agency, and then a Globaltrekker agency appeared, and a Globe Treks agency, and Globetrekker 2.&apos; He&apos;s not an it-was-so-much-better-back-then sort, Tony. Part of this, of course, is that Lonely Planet must be seen to be striding boldly into an age of digital guides but more it seems that he still loves travelling, is a self-described &apos;obsessive&apos; about it, and still gets a kick out of going somewhere new (he&apos;s on 130 countries now &apos;although Maureen tells me it&apos;s absurd to count&apos;). Hilary Bradt, on the other hand, says she misses the &apos;serendipity&apos; of the old days and, now in her 60s, she thinks &apos;us older ones&apos; are more adventurous than young people who all use the same guidebook and go to same places &apos;they follow the pack because they don&apos;t feel secure enough although of course when I was 20 I was exactly the same&apos;. Of course, it&apos;s not just that guidebooks have changed in the last three and a half decades, it&apos;s that everything has: cheap flights, mobile phones, emails, the internet, nice boutique hotels with quaint original features but tip-top Western plumbing. James Daunt tells me that the latest hot potato to fly off the shelves are the &apos;Luxe&apos; guides. &apos;What?&apos; I say. &apos;Those crappy little things on a concertina-ed bit of paper?&apos; But yes, apparently we&apos;ve come over a bit Russian and want our luxury above all else. I idly think of setting up Super Sexxxxxy VIP Guides and really cleaning up. The only real link between now and the ideology of Across Asia on the Cheap is in the Sixties&apos; notions of freedom and self-fulfilment that are still the vital ingredient of all travel narratives - both literary and personal - and that these guides were the first to harness, repackage and sell right back to us. And if a book remains a book or becomes a pdf, that&apos;s unlikely to change. It&apos;s time, though, perhaps, for the counterculture to move on. Lonely Planet-meets-the-BBC is now the establishment. It&apos;s a nationalised industry. It&apos;s practically the Queen! Where are the Sex Pistols when you need them? What everyone complains about up to and including Tony Wheeler, is how bland, formulaic, PC, corporate, the books have become. The very first Lonely Planet guide I used was the one to India. &apos;It&apos;s still the one I&apos;m proudest of,&apos; Tony says, a best-seller when it came out in 1980 and it was still the only one to the country by the time that I picked it up in 1989, and slavishly read its every word. What I remember most about it, though, is &apos;Geoff&apos;, or Geoff Crowther, one of the original authors not just of the India guide but the Africa and South American one too, whose author bio showed to have a full beard and a vegetable garden in Australia devoted to exotic herbs. Whole evenings passed doing Geoff impressions (it was a variation, basically, of Neil, the hippy off the Young Ones): on where to score dope, or get the best view of a certain temple. His opinions were forever butting into the text. So annoying! Yet, somehow, so memorable. He&apos;s gone now. A broken man living in Goa, Tony Wheeler tells me, and it&apos;s hard not to feel a pang. Is it a parable, I wonder? Although in the end, I decide it&apos;s probably not. The latest edition of Lonely Planet India is a monumental 1,236 pages, produced by 12 writers, and it&apos;s, without a doubt, a terrifically useful book if you need to navigate your way from Calcutta to Bangalore; probably even more so when it&apos;s a couple of megabytes rather than several kilos of dense matter weighing like a stone at the bottom of your bag. But, well, there&apos;s a certain something that&apos;s been lost; a Geoffness, I think I&apos;ll call it, that joins the scrapheap of travellers&apos; hand-me-downs waiting to be collected at a dusty poste restante, in a land far, far away. From hippies to hip hotels The original Seventies backpacker guides used to revel in their countercultural status, sneering at smart hotels and posh restaurants wherever possible. Now, however, &apos;style guides&apos; are the fastest growing sector of the market.  &apos;Young couples with money buy these cool guides because they are the ones to be seen with,&apos; says Brett Wolstencroft manager of Daunt Books, a specialist travel bookshop in Marylebone.  These are the front-runners:  Hip Hotels: Started the trend of style-focused travel guides; now has more than 15 titles.  Luxe Guides: Pocket-sized and written with acerbic wit.  Hedonist&apos;s Guides: Sleek but comprehensive, photo-heavy, quirky destinations.  Nota Bene: A subscription service, costing \u00a3235 per year.

Last time I was sick, but I couldn&apos;t even lie down to sleep. Should I spend some of my savings and go by business class? Is it worth it? Worth stretching yourself After years of long-haul holidays my wife and I, as a treat, decided to fly business class. That was four years ago and we would never travel any other way to distant destinations. Of course it costs more but you are treated like a human, have the ability to sleep reasonably comfortably, can take more luggage and in the event of delays have comfortable surroundings in which to pass the time. If your savings can take the expense, then treat yourself. Tony Greenfield, via email Slow boat cuts carbon count Go by cargo boat. They can be very comfortable and take about six weeks either way, but you don&apos;t have much opportunity to spend money. You&apos;ll be helping your carbon footprint too and if you keep a travel journal you may get a small fee from a travel magazine who&apos;d be interested in printing it.  Jacqui Davis, Cambridge Family ties bind Children living abroad often means you have to fly long haul to keep those family ties strong. These trips aren&apos;t just holidays, they&apos;re part and parcel of your family life. You may not always be able to travel, so go business class and make it an experience to remember.  Ann Newell, Thame, Oxfordshire Half-way house Travel in premium economy class. It may not be as luxurious as a fully flat bed but the seats recline 50% more than in economy and have a full leg rest and foot bar.  Stephanie Davenport, Milton Keynes.  Business isn&apos;t always the business Not all business class is the same, and they don&apos;t all have flat beds. It&apos;s not worth the extra if you only get a bigger seat.  Howard Peters, Haywards Heath Make a trip out of it Make up a flight of several sectors and spend a day or more at each city - for example, Dubai, Kuala Lumpur, Sydney, Auckland. Each city has a lot to offer, as well as luxury accommodation that will add up to far less than the business class fare. Also, follow a few rules that will help your body cope with flight at altitude: do not drink alcohol or eat large meals for two days before and during the journey, drink water during the flight and set your watch to the destination time at the start of each flight.  Marilyn Charlton, East Yorkshire, who wins this week&apos;s \u00a325 National Book Token Peruse the permutations It can sometimes cost little more than \u00a3729 to fly London-Hong Kong-Christchurch-Auckland-Los Angeles-London, while other permutations up to \u00a31,400 are still cheaper than a business return. Even an overland leg, such as bus or train across North America, might ease the strain of long haul.  John Burke, via email  Railway&apos;s the way Go by Eurostar to Brussels then connect to the Thalys express to Cologne in time to do some food shopping, so you&apos;re not reliant on the restaurant car. You can now lie down on the clean sheets as the train heads for Moscow, where two nights later you arrive at 7.30am (ish). Just after 8am on most days a train leaves for Beijing, arriving by evening rush hour five days later, having seen lots of birch trees and most of Siberia and Mongolia. You could go on to Hong Kong or Vietnam from here by train; however, the Z trains to Shanghai will whizz you there overnight in comfort. Maybe time to fly a bit. Bangkok is not a long haul away. Now back on the train to head south through Thailand and Malaysia to Singapore, which is about two days away then a flight to New Zealand, possibly via Australia. This trip should give you plenty to talk about with the family. Visit  seat61.com, which is a wonderful know-all website for world train travel. If you are still considering flying business class, don&apos;t bother. Spend your money on this journey with real class.  Roger Coates, Hull Countdown to touchdown I always pack a pair of track pants which I change into just before the flight takes off, a pashmina, a blow-up pillow, some lip and face moisturisers, toothbrush and a clean pair of knickers. Audio books on an MP3 are the greatest thing for demolishing the time. Finally, once on board, remember that in less than a day you&apos;ll be seeing your children and grandchildren again and every hour on board is an hour less until you are reunited.  Kate Vennell, Coulsdon Go on, treat yourself Go first class. You occasionally find bargains, and even if you don&apos;t, you&apos;ll be treated like royalty and have the cabin almost to yourself. The only problem is that it spoils you for ever travelling economy again.  Tony Sherlock, Oswestry, Shropshire In-transit hotel My mother-in-law regularly does this journey and recently switched to business class due to back pain; definitely worth the extra, she says. Seat design differs by plane and airline, so do some research to make sure you get the right sort of seat. The long journey is also much more bearable if you split it and get a good sleep at an airport transit hotel. These are in the transit terminal itself, so make sure your bags are checked right through to New Zealand from the UK. They operate in six-hour slots (you can pre-book online) and are eminently affordable. If possible, go via Changi airport (Singapore) - it&apos;s the best international airport I&apos;ve been to, and there&apos;s even a swimming pool and gardens for transit passengers. And don&apos;t forget to check if you can get air miles too, especially if you stump up for business class. Rachel Smithies, London Join the club I have travelled to New Zealand twice - the first time economy and the second time club class. Club is well worth dipping into your savings for. I arrived much less stressed and didn&apos;t dread the journey back home. I am very frightened of flying, but felt very cared for in club class and the amount of space you get takes away the hemmed in feeling. Make sure you break the journey up into bearable lengths. London to Singapore and stopover two nights, Singapore to Sydney and one or two nights stopover, then a short hop to New Zealand, which you could do economy. Christina Davies, via email Around the world in less than the price of a business ticket If time is not a constraint, buy a round-the-world ticket and stagger your journey, stopping off for a couple of days in, for example, Dubai, Bangkok, Sydney, Bali, Hawaii, San Francisco, Los Angeles or New York. Even with the additional cost of accommodation this will be less expensive than flying business class.

Their visit to see Home Office officials is the latest move in an aggressive campaign by the military junta that deposed Thaksin last September in a bloodless coup while he was in New York at the UN general assembly. He has since lived in high-profile exile in London with a \u00a34.5m mansion in Weybridge, Surrey, and a rented flat in Park Lane owned by his friend and Fulham FC owner Mohammed al Fayed. In June he bought Manchester City for \u00a381.6m and installed two of his three children on the board. Warrants for the arrest of Thaksin, 58, and his wife Potjaman have been issued in Thailand in the past few weeks, and \u00a31.3bn of family assets in the country have been frozen. In a related development this week, the Thai anti-corruption body, the Assets Scrutiny Committee, said it would file criminal charges against Thaksin&apos;s 25-year-old daughter Pinthongta - a Manchester City director and a student at the London School of Economics - over her refusal to answer questions about the family&apos;s share dealings when she unexpectedly turned up for a committee hearing in Bangkok. She handed over a letter saying it would be unacceptable to give evidence that could bring about negative consequences for her parents. Thaksin has repeatedly denied the charges, claiming they are politically motivated. A spokesman for his public relations firm, Bell Pottinger, said he was aware of the officials&apos; visit but had no further comment. If convicted of dishonesty, Thaksin will have to relinquish control of City under the Premier League&apos;s &quot;fit-and-proper person test&quot; - a move that would sorely disappoint City fans who have made it clear they are more interested in his wealth than his reputation. With Sven-Goran Eriksson as manager and the team riding high in the Premier League, few are concerned about Human Rights Watch describing him as &quot;a human-rights abuser of the worst kind&quot; - a commentary on the 2,500 petty drug dealers and users who were summarily killed in a ferocious war-on-drugs blitz in 2003. Last month, Thai embassy officials discreetly started the extradition process with a visit to the Home Office seeking advice on implementing the 1911 extradition treaty between the two countries. A central issue was whether the charges were covered in the treaty. The first alleges that he used his influence for his wife to buy a piece of choice Bangkok real estate for a third of its estimated value. The second, added later, involves allegedly illegal transactions in the tax-free sale of the family telecoms business, Shin Corp, to a Singapore state company early last year through an opaque off-shore structure. Legislation allowing foreign entities to own up to 49% of Thai telecoms companies was passed only four days before the sale. Together with allegations of rampant cronyism, a disastrous military campaign against separatist Muslims, and an arrogant propensity to muzzle his critics, it was the Shin Corp sale that sparked opposition outrage and ultimately the military coup. The junta, which has promised new elections at the end of December, may have an uphill battle in pressing their case. The British government has little appetite for assisting a military junta putting on trial a legitimately elected politician.

But the bullets and clubs unleashed on Buddhist monks have worked. The monks have retreated, and an eerie normalcy has returned to Yangon (Rangoon), Burma&apos;s principal city and former capital. That crackdown continues under cover of darkness. When the sun sets in Burma, fear rises. Everyone listens half awake for the dreaded knock on the door. Any night, the military&apos;s agents can come for you, take you away, and make sure you are never heard from again. In recent nights, the junta&apos;s henchmen have burst into monasteries, lined up sleepy monks, and smashed their shaved heads against the walls, spattering them with blood. Scores of others, perhaps hundreds, have been carted off for interrogation, torture, or execution. The nighttime assault on a United Nations employee and her family made international news, but hundreds of less well-connected Burmese have been similarly abused. For 45 years, Burma&apos;s people have been subjected to the junta&apos;s reign of terror. My father was born in Rangoon long before the 1962 coup that brought the current regime to power. Afterwards, many of my relatives, prosperous Indian merchants who had been settled in Burma for generations, abandoned homes and businesses in order to save their skins as chaos enveloped the city, later renamed Yangon. A relative who now lives in Bangkok, but who returned part-time to Yangon in response to overtures from Burma&apos;s cash-starved rulers, recalled those days: &quot;We lived through hell. We never knew when we woke up each morning what would happen. People were being denounced left and right. They could just come and take you away and take everything away from you.&quot; Those who couldn&apos;t leave Burma, or didn&apos;t want to, have lived with this fear ever since. The United States and Europe have issued strong statements condemning the crackdown and calling upon Burma&apos;s neighbours, especially India and China, to exert their influence on the regime. The response from both has been muted (as it has from Thailand, which also has strong economic ties with Burma). China balks at interfering in the &quot;internal affairs&quot; of a neighbour from whom it gets precious natural gas and potential access to the sea. India, which &quot;normalised&quot; bilateral relations a few years ago, is reluctant to alienate Burma&apos;s military, with which it has worked closely to counter rebels in India&apos;s northeast who had been using the common border to tactical advantage. To this end, India has provided aid, including tanks and training, to Burma&apos;s military. But the main reason for India&apos;s good relations with Burma&apos;s ruling thugs is the country&apos;s vast and still largely unexploited energy reserves, which India desperately needs to fuel its economic boom. India has invested $150m in a gas exploration deal off the Arakan coast of Burma, and India&apos;s state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and Gas Authority of India Ltd have taken a 30% stake in two offshore gas fields in direct competition with PetroChina, which has also been given a stake. India and China are simply doing what the US and European countries have done for so long: trump rhetoric about democracy and human rights with policies that serve their strategic and energy security interests. US relations with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are two examples, and America&apos;s Chevron and France&apos;s Total, two of the world&apos;s oil giants, continue to do a brisk business in Burma, thanks to loopholes in the sanctions. But the rise of India and China means that the time-tested posture of western democracies toward emerging states to &quot;do as we say, not as we do&quot; will become less tenable. If the EU and the US want democratic India to act according to its stated moral values and not its vital national interests when these appear to conflict, they had better be prepared to do the same. Feeling the heat, including threats from some US senators to link America&apos;s nuclear deal with India to its actions in Burma, India has announced that it is asking for the release of Burmese democratic opposition leader and Nobel prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest. But the credibility of all democratic regimes, not just India&apos;s, is at stake in what unfolds in Burma.

It was a communal exhalation of breath, a shared sense of the improbable having become a reality, of the extraordinary being made ordinary. Then the cheering started. After 82 tense minutes, the England team was through to the final of the World Cup and no-one could quite comprehend what was happening. At the Cambridge Tavern, situated appropriately enough in the shadow of the Arc de Triomphe, the celebration was marked by jubilant roars and the sight of grown men wiping away tears. Strangers hugged each other with all the delirium of battle-worn soldiers returning from a victorious war. Everywhere there was the noise of klaxons, the distant strains of &apos;Swing Low Sweet Chariot&apos; and the barely discernable sound of 40,000 shaking heads of England fans. &apos;It&apos;s unbelievably exciting,&apos; said Jessica Fortescue, 28, who works for a magazine in Paris. &apos;And it&apos;s a relief not to have to deal with the smugness of my French counterparts in the office.&apos; At the Champs de Mars, the English team&apos;s celebrations were relayed to thousands of spectators spread out in front of the Eiffel Tower on giant screens, hoisted against the night sky. Pools of light illuminated the jubilant features of English fans, their red-and-white face paint smeared with sweat and tears, their St George&apos;s flags muddied and grass-stained. The French, by contrast, were drowning their tears in the Seine and their sorrows in a bottle of Bordeaux. In French bars, the TV screens were switched off within five minutes of the final whistle, the lights turned up and the glum supporters sent packing on their way. &apos;I&apos;m going home to cry,&apos; said Parisien Lisa Bigot, 24. &apos;This is so upsetting.&apos; But for all that their celebrated Gallic pride had been dented, the French proved to be surprisingly generous losers. &apos;On the train back from St Denis, French fans were coming up to us and shaking out hands, saying that they hoped we&apos;d win in the final,&apos; says Will Bax, a 29-year-old property analyst who lives and works in Paris. &apos;It was a great atmosphere and a heart-stopping match. By the end of it I was jumping up and down in my seat. I think I&apos;m probably going to have to have an early night just to prepare myself for the excitement of the final.&apos; Similarly, the English celebrations, although raucous, were also rather considerate towards the wounded feelings of their French hosts. In Paris last night, the entente was very cordiale &apos;I think we&apos;re going to go and eat a dinner of escargots now,&apos; said Richard Unwin, a British businessman who lives in Geneva, as he strolled down the Champs Elysees wearing an all-weather England cagoule and a smile of satisfaction. &apos;It&apos;s the least we can do to show our appreciation for a well fought match.&apos; Even the gendarmes, congregating around the foot of the Arc de Triomphe in case of trouble, were distinctly underoccupied. They stood stock still like a series of Inspector Clouseau waxworks as fireworks were let off in the velvety night sky and a distant cry of &apos;Come on England&apos; was heard emanating from the nearby Metro station. For the English, it was the culmination of a glorious weekend of almost baseless optimism. At Waterloo station on Friday, England&apos;s army of supporters had gathered on the concourse with the quiet determination of men who refused to contemplate defeat. They had swept through the Eurostar&apos;s electronic check-in gates with all the enthusiasm of Henry V&apos;s men thronging forth on St Crispin&apos;s Day. They had been convinced of victory, determined the Dunkirk spirit would see them through. &apos;It makes it more exciting to think we might beat the Old Enemy,&apos; said Syd Heaton, an electrical engineer from Durham, with a broad smile on his face and a rapidly emptying pint glass in his hand. The Old Enemy. The nation that gave us Eric Cantona, Marcel Marceau and an opportunity to use the phrase &apos;cheese-eating surrender monkeys&apos;. The country divided from us by a small stretch of sea and a huge chasm of national understanding. A rugby team whose best player, Sebastien Chabal, looks like a cross between an overgrown Asterix character and an Old Testament prophet. How could England possibly lose? And so it proved, a magnificent triumph of hope over expectation. From the beginning, it was hard not to get caught up in the cheerful melee on the way over to Paris. Admittedly, my knowledge of rugby is limited to a brief period when I was 15 and my school friends developed a crush on the Underwood twins, but it hardly mattered when faced with the fine morale of the England supporters. Like all successfully organised troops, they had their supply lines working smoothly as soon as the train drew out of Waterloo. A long queue of fans stretched back from the buffet car, each one politely asking for plastic stirrers and mini pots of coffee creamer. They wore their uniform with quiet pride: well-waxed Barbours and orange corduroys for the cavalry; red-and-white England shirts for the infantry, decorously draped in St George&apos;s flags. As the trains drew in on Friday and Saturday and the Gare du Nord swiftly filled with several thousand England supporters, it became clear that the invading hordes had not thought about transport into enemy territory. The entrance to the Metro was clogged by confused tourists, it was a two-hour wait for official taxis and the bus map looked like a particularly complicated game of Sudoku. Many of the 40,000 fans in Paris this weekend simply gave up and headed to the nearest brasserie, where supercilious French waiters served them pints of lager, their mouths downturned with barely concealed Gallic disdain. &apos;Football&apos;s more my game,&apos; said Anthony Cadiz, a 29-year-old minicab driver who was enterprisingly charging a minimum fee of \u008050 (\u00a335) to get anywhere. &apos;But I like rugby at the moment because it&apos;s bringing us so much business.&apos; Flights and ferries to Paris were fully booked all weekend, with Eurostar reporting a 40 per cent increase in travellers from this time last year. Tickets for the match were changing hands on Ebay for \u00a31,300. England Rugby Travel, an agency selling World Cup packages, reported selling out within three hours of the team&apos;s quarter-final victory against Australia last week. In Paris, the boulevards were lined with cafes and bars displaying large red-and-white banners promising a friendly welcome &apos;for people thirsty for rugby&apos;. In the run-up to the match, most of the British clientele appeared to be more thirsty for Carlsberg. Three streets in the Saint-Germain-des-Pres area of Paris have been renamed &apos;vallee de la Soif&apos; [valley of thirst] for rugby fans. At The Frog and Rosbif, possibly the oldest English pub in Paris, there was a constant stream of red-faced supporters making their way to the bar bearing dog-eared phrase-books and hopeful expressions on their faces. For the most part, everyone was terribly courteous. Given that this was billed as a bloodthirsty battle between time-sworn enemies, the pervading spirit of politeness was rather a disappointment. &apos;Despite our historic rivalry, I respect British culture and the British people,&apos; said Eric Le Roux, a 37-year-old manager in the aeronautics industry. &apos;The animosity is relatively superficial. The English are thrilled to be coming to Paris for a weekend break and the French are delighted to have them here. We are not restaging the Battle of Hastings.&apos; The whole weekend was marked by a cheerfully inclusive atmosphere. There were almost as many New Zealanders in Paris as English. The jovial sense of anticipation was such that no-one even got annoyed when I made somewhat inapproriate comments about muscular thighs and asked about the offside rule with a feminine simper. Patrick Graham, 32, who runs Tesco Financial Services in Thailand and had flown in from Bangkok. He had launched into a detailed argument about returning to the 10-man rugby of the Fifties which I couldn&apos;t really follow. Patrick used to play for a rugby team in Hong Kong called the Pot-Bellied Pigs, whose slogan was &apos;Putting the pink back into rugby&apos;. &apos;It&apos;s not gay,&apos; said Patrick when I voiced a thought that all this talk about grappling in the ruck was a bit homoerotic. &apos;Really. Don&apos;t put that in your article.&apos; Still, it was difficult not to notice that the banks of the Seine, normally populated with romantic couples gazing into each other&apos;s eyes, were now swarming with male buddies, swaying together arm-in-arm and talking about players nicknamed exciting, testosterone-fuelled things like &apos;The Caveman&apos; and &apos;Raging Bull&apos;. Wayne Simmonds, 37, and Dave Wilding, 31, had driven from Portsmouth in Wayne&apos;s Hummer to arrive in Paris on Friday evening and bought two tickets from &apos;a guy outside the Gare du Nord&apos; for the suspiciously cheap price of \u0080550. &apos;We drove here in our England rugby shirts and got beeped by other cars along the way,&apos; said Wayne, his red-and-white chest puffed with pride. &apos;It took us six hours but it&apos;s definitely worth it.&apos; Back then, it was ridiculous to ask Wayne and Dave if they thought England was going to win. &apos;It&apos;s going to be close, but we are in the ascendancy,&apos; Wayne said, as if interpreting a horoscope. &apos;The French temperament will let them down and they will lose their heads.&apos; Like Marie Antoinette? &apos;Erm. Yes. But less serious than that.&apos; Back on the Champs Elysees after the final whistle, Matt Calder, 25 clutched a rugby ball between sweaty palms and could barely speak through his exhiliration. &apos;It&apos;s been an amazing night,&apos; he said. &apos;It&apos;s almost too good to be true.&apos; Reactions to the result The British view:  &apos;I want to congratulate the whole England rugby team on their fantastic achievement. This is a proud day for the country, and I wish the team the best of luck for the final.&apos; Prime Minister Gordon Brown &apos;What an amazing result. The England team have made the country enormously proud with their performance.&apos; Conservative leader David Cameron &apos;We have faced some incredible teams in this tournament - and none stronger than the one we have taken out tonight.&apos; Match hero Jonny Wilkinson &apos;Today was one of those very special days when the underdog rises up and manages to get through.&apos; England captain Phil Vickery The French view:  &apos;We always believed in our chances of winning the tournament.

It&apos;s that you&apos;re never too old to hitchhike. I&apos;ve always loved the serendipity of it: not knowing where you will spend the night and the impossibility of planning anything. And now, in my mid-sixties but still occasionally hitching a lift, I marvel again at the astonishing kindness and generosity of ordinary people. And, if anything, it&apos;s got easier now I&apos;m older and not seen as a potential threat. I binged on hitchhiking in my teens and early twenties, assuming it was something you grew out of. But a decade later I met, and married, an American who loved travel, but didn&apos;t own a car. We thumbed our way thousands of miles through the US and Canada, and some of my best travel memories are from those rides. Extraordinary memories. Like the time a man stopped for us on an island off the coast of New England, drove us to his house &apos;so you can see where I live&apos; then gestured to the driver&apos;s seat and told us to go and enjoy ourselves. &apos;Just bring the car back before the last ferry leaves,&apos; he said. And the elderly man who spent his days touring around looking for hitchhikers. &apos;Listen, I&apos;m retired, I love driving and I like people. My wife says that one day some young girl is gonna accuse me of rape. But look at me! Do I look capable of rape?&apos; He gave a wheezy laugh. &apos;Now where do you kids wanna go?&apos; Turning the tables, I remember one couple who drove in tight-lipped silence for half an hour after picking us up (they&apos;d argued about whether to stop for us). By the end of the day, however, we joined forces to have a lobster and wine feast in a hired cabin on the Canadian coast. &apos;Boy I&apos;m glad we stopped for you guys!&apos; the husband said. &apos;We were going to drive back to Boston tonight.&apos; These days I only hitch when there is no public transport. But the buzz is still there. How else would you ride in the back of a pick-up truck in Greece and find yourself the subject of speculative attention from a couple of Albanians? One asked my Greek-speaking friend how old I was. Maybe, you could see him thinking, she&apos;s a very wrinkly 30-year-old; on being told the truth they lost interest completely. In Reunion, in the Indian Ocean, the Creole driver wanted to know about England. Was it near France? We explained it was an island linked to France by a tunnel under the sea. &apos;Under the sea? Can you see fish?&apos; Is hitchhiking dangerous? Maybe, but if we never take risks, never experience heart-pounding fear as well as heart-lifting exhilaration, if we close ourselves off from the goodness that is in so many people as well as the evil that is in a few, what are we really gaining? Why not just stay at home? 12 The Mekong Delta  They may be sailing towards their own sunset, but a New Year cruise finds the Saga brigade reliving their rock&apos;n&apos;roll years at Uncle Ho&apos;s place. Allan Jenkins, editor of the Observer Magazine, enjoys the fireworks as the Spirit of Adventure hits Saigon The signs dotted around the walls call for silence and tranquillity. The local families are communing quietly, contentedly, in the sacred waters of the world&apos;s biggest indoor springs on China&apos;s Hainan Island. But then, suddenly, a scream shatters the peace. It comes from the arc of pink, plump and bikinied British women. &apos;They are eating my crotch!&apos; is the indignant shriek. &apos;I am telling you! I have seen off two husbands. I know when someone&apos;s eating my crotch!&apos; The women collapse in waves of helpless laughter, sending the swarms of tiny fish that had been &apos;massaging&apos; their skin darting for safety, and more respectful hosts. Welcome to the unexpected world of the new intrepid traveller. Not the 20-year-old timid backpacker on a gap year. This is a more seasoned and adventurous explorer: the seventysomething (and counting) Saga cruise veteran. Secretly, I had been waiting until I was ready to join a Saga holiday. I had watched their brilliant rebranding: away from the stairlift to the Rolling Stones, from the Second World War to the Seventies. I had even been headhunted to edit their magazine, but had panicked. I didn&apos;t feel ready for the twilight of the old folks&apos; home and Folkestone. But I was so much older then and I&apos;m younger than that now. The idea of spending a Christmas Eve dawn-cruising the Mekong Delta before docking in Ho Chi Minh City had conjured glamorous images of Graham Greene backed by a Hendrix soundtrack. We joined the Spirit of Adventure in Bangkok and headed up the coasts of Cambodia, Vietnam and China, before docking in Hong Kong just after New Year. There is something &apos;right&apos; about coming into a city by ship. Most coastal towns have been there for centuries; the port is usually central and has an authentic life that the airport, miles away on identikit flatland, cannot match. Ho Chi Minh harbour doesn&apos;t disappoint. The silent, four-hour trip upriver with a pallid mist lifting over the Apocalypse Now mangroves; the fishing families waking, washing and waving on their tiny houseboats; and pulling up to the wharf with its welcoming committee of banners and balloons will stay with me until, well, I am as old as the other passengers. You see, despite Jagger and Jerry Hall gracing the cover of Saga Magazine, there is at first something of a culture shock at being surrounded by so many &apos;old&apos; people. You will almost certainly be the only ones who still work (news of current employment is mostly greeted with amused indulgence). But then you realise you are being welcomed as trophy teenagers, the new kids on deck. And you start to see that in many ways these &apos;elderly&apos; people with their careers or businesses behind them have a freedom and appetite for life and new experience you may have forgotten. At midnight on New Year&apos;s Eve, after a generous dinner at the captain&apos;s table, I am dragged on to the dancefloor by the same group of 70-year-old women now revived by gin and their mineral spa. If I have been hoping for something sedate this soon disappears. The champagne flows, the hips grind, the rock rolls and the image of a tea dance disappears. This is uninhibited hedonism reminiscent of the heyday of Heaven or Studio 54. Then it hits me. For most of us, another new year is nothing remarkable, but for these extraordinary women who may have survived surgery, bereavement, even the war, being here in the South China Sea, truly alive on a throbbing dancefloor, seeing in 2007 is something to really celebrate. So I try (and mostly fail) to do them justice. It&apos;s now 10 months later and I am already scanning the Spirit of Adventure&apos;s plans for the coming year. There&apos;s a trip up the Amazon scheduled for next month and this Christmas&apos;s cruise is to the Antarctic. For the Spirit, the wonderful spa women and, I hope, for me, this Saga will continue. spiritofadventure.co.uk 13 La Venise Verte France&apos;s quietest journey... Alastair Sawday, founder of the Special Places to Stay guides, finds perfect peace on le Marais Poitevin It is quiet there, so soft that the &apos;other&apos; world is unreal. The waters hardly move, sliding imperceptibly from one canal to another, carrying their greenness, the boats, the sounds of dipping oars, the reflections of birds, and the great overhanging trees. This is a rare, lazy, meandering world of waters, meadows, fens, dykes and slow rivers. This is le Marais Poitevin, also known as La Venise Verte. I came across it when driving through France, years ago. The children were young and restless and we rowed them out under the trees for a soporific afternoon of happiness. I have never forgotten that day. There are 97,000 hectares of it along the coast, a great marshy Parc Interregional that is a vastly important eco-system supporting a rich variety of wildlife, especially seabirds. It is a fabulous work of man, kept alive by an ancient drainage system needing constant attention. Come and be astonished and softened by this strange area. Farmers have for centuries carried their cows back and forth cross the waterways by punt, the flat-bottomed barques for which le Marais is famous. You can hire them from the embarcaderes and drift off by yourself, swimming, idling, picnicking and slipping into a pleasant torpor. Begin in Coulon, to the east, where there are hotels, and a scattering of hamlets and villages to explore to the south. Or La Rochelle, just out of the area, but worth spending time in, in itself. There are two B&amp;Bs in the area - both enchanting. One of them, Le Logis d&apos;Elpenor, is right on the River Vendee, with its own boats and excellent fishing (pike, roach, bass). Another, Le Logis de la Clef de Bois, is in the lovely village of Fontenay Le Comte, a &apos;ville d&apos;art et d&apos;histoire&apos;, just a few kilometres from the Marais. I can think of few better places to while away a few days, perhaps after some time on the lovely Isle de Re just off La Rochelle&apos;s coast, before plunging back on to the autoroute. \u00b7 For bed and breakfast, lelogisdelpenor.fr; clef-de-bois.com 14 Bahia Sugary beaches, turquoise seas, icy cocktails... Sarah Miller, editor of Conde Nast Traveller, on the wild beauty of Brazil I came back from holiday understanding why Brazilians have such beautiful skin. They&apos;re not just happy in it, but they have the benefit of the climate&apos;s natural moisturiser - when it rains, it does so spectacularly. Of course, Brazil is such a vast country that you can fly away to different weather. It was raining when we were in the charming town of Parati, south of Rio, at the beginning of 2007, but it was brilliant sunshine in the northern region of Bahia. And nowhere in the whole of this part of Latin America is more beautiful than the tiny wilderness island of Fernando de Noronha. It was discovered in 1503 by Amerigo Vespucci, and colonised by the usual suspects - the Portuguese, Dutch and the French. Charles Darwin visited this natural paradise in 1832 and it has been prized for being a natural wonderland ever since. Getting there is not so easy, but the wild turquoise seas caressing powdery beaches are worth all the effort; as are the dolphins that gather in the bays and the turtles that lay their eggs in the golden sands. The most stunning stretch of coastline is the Baia do Sancho, which is accessible only by boat, as is much of the rest of the island, which is a national park. Inland there are forest trails and a world that hums with the sounds of cicadas. And then there are the island&apos;s manmade attractions, such as the dark red colonial buildings in the tiny capital of Vila Los Remedios. Add to this the languid cadences of Brazilian jazz and an icy Caipirinha on your hotel terrace and the laid-back holiday of your dreams is within grasp. Pousada Maravilha is really the only place to stay. A collection of &apos;rooms&apos; around a pool, it&apos;s where Brazil&apos;s culture minister Gilberto Gil came last New Year with his fellow music legend Caetano Veloso. So why was I miles away in Parati? Enjoying the sensuality of the south for the all-night revelry that is 31 December. We&apos;d rented a house on the beach and were taken out on a fabulous sailing boat into a spectacular stretch of water punctuated with 350 islands that are home to some of the continent&apos;s most gorgeous private houses and delicious restaurants. A couple of hours across the bay from Parati is Ilha Grande, and beyond that is Angra dos Reis. Anchor off one of the many small coves and you&apos;ll hear the screech of parakeets or find yourself distracted by the bellyflop of a fish pirouetting into the sunshine before disappearing into the glassy depths. There is nothing more magical than waking up on board to such astounding surroundings. With or without the rain, Brazil is the one place I have visited where all your senses succumb to the sounds, tastes, and fragrant scents on the night air. It is quite simply one of the most beautiful places on earth. pousadamaravilha.com.br 15 Drum Hain Like most mountain climbers, Nick Crane, travel writer and broadcaster, is on a breathless quest for the perfect view. And after 30 years of trying, he&apos;s found it on top of the Isle of Skye Britain&apos;s most gut-fluttering natural spectacle is hidden behind the glaciated teeth of Skye&apos;s Black Cuillins. I suppose I have been looking for this spot for the best part of 30 years. Mountaineering - for me anyway - is partly a search for the perfect view. It&apos;s unattainable, but the never-ending quest is an end in itself. On Skye, I reckon I&apos;ve come as close as I&apos;ve ever been to finding that topographic peak. I was led to Druim Hain by a man who was celebrated in his age as Britain&apos;s most successful travel writer. HV Morton spent much of the Twenties and Thirties bringing Britain to its people. In his Bullnose Morris he set out on a series of quests to uncover the essence of his own archipelago. In Search of England was followed in 1929 by In Search of Scotland. When his readers wanted more, he followed up with In Scotland Again. All this from a petrolhead who privately wondered whether Hitler might not be a bad thing for Britain. Morton was the last of eight homegrown &apos;explorers&apos; to feature in the recent BBC TV series Great British Journeys, and it was while I was researching this troubled Mr Toad that I first read of Druim Hain. Ridiculously remote, Druim Hain was well known to Victorian tourists, but has faded from the radar of 21st-century sightseers. In his In Search of Scotland, Morton wrote: &apos;I decide to walk 20 miles. I sling a haversack full of rations over my shoulders, make sure I have plenty of matches, take a map, a strong ash-stick and strike off over hummocky moorland into the Valhalla of Glen Sligachan.&apos; Morton was never one to play down the scale of his exploits (his &apos;20 miles&apos; is closer to 12) but when he eventually scrambled up the ice-polished bedrock to the crest of Druim Hain, he could scarcely believe his eyes. The ridge stands at about 1,000ft above sea level, and only here, on Druim Hain, is it possible to absorb the ridge of the Black Cuillins in its ferocious entirety. &apos;This,&apos; Morton wrote, &apos;is surely the grandest and most gloomy view in the British Isles.&apos; One man&apos;s &apos;gloomy&apos; is another&apos;s &apos;glorious&apos;. Morton came at Druim Hain from the wrong direction. He should have taken a boat from Elgol, across Loch Scavaig and into the throat of Loch na Cuilce. Today, you disembark at a steel ladder below the mountaineering hut, then ford &apos;Mad Stream&apos; (impassable in spate) at the outfall of Loch Coruisk. There is no Scottish loch like Coruisk, its plate-glass surface a mirror for the kind of tortured crags you&apos;d expect in Tolkein or Patagonia. The rough path to Druim Hain scrabbles upward from the western shore of the loch. At the top, where Morton heard the wind in the feathers of an eagle, there is a level platform of ancient volcanic stone. It is the perfect spot to contemplate Ruskin&apos;s view that mountains are &apos;the beginning and the end of all natural scenery&apos;. \u00b7 Nicholas Crane&apos;s latest book, Great British Journeys, is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, priced \u00a320 16 Coffee Bay It could almost be Cornwall...except for the eagles. Roger Diski, founder of Rainbow Tours, finds a corner of England in South Africa Coffee Bay, on the Wild Coast of South Africa, is an overlooked stretch of Indian Ocean coastline beyond the Garden Route and before Durban on South Africa&apos;s eastern Cape. It&apos;s &apos;wild&apos; as in the sea - countless ships have gone down off these shores. Coffee Bay itself is named after the coffee plants which grew wild after a ship laden with beans went down in 1863. I discovered it in 1993 when, after years in the anti-apartheid movement, I started organising these trips for British ANC supporters to visit the communities they&apos;d supported and to see the new South Africa after the democratic election of 1994. And it&apos;s special because it&apos;s one of the very few places one can stay in South Africa where you can mix in a relaxed way with the rural black population as they go about their everyday life. Years ago, the little resort hotels on the Wild Coast - Trennery&apos;s, Seacrest, the Haven, the Kob Inn, the Ocean View - were smart, popular holiday destinations for Johannesburg families. But then the apartheid government declared the area to be an &apos;independent&apos; homeland for the black Xhosa people, and the hotels and resorts went into steep decline. When I first visited, the Ocean View was the only functioning hotel in the area, but over the past few years the hotels have come back to life and again attract South African tourists. They are not considered smart enough for the international visitors, who prefer the stylish boutique hotels of the Garden Route. My favourite, however, is still the Ocean View at Coffee Bay. The Ocean View is utilitarian in design and furnishings, but clean, comfortable and friendly - there&apos;s good local seafood, fresh crayfish, oysters and prawns, and a bar where you can&apos;t escape conversation. But the key attraction is the location. Bizarrely, the overwhelming impression is of southwest England. Think of your favourite beauty spot, strip away half-a-century of development -the car parks, crowds, cafes, curio shops, yellow lines, signs and promenades - and you have Coffee Bay: just close-cropped granite cliffs tumbling on to a deserted sandy beach and one small, friendly, old-fashioned hotel with a garden ending at the sea. There are rock pools teeming with life trapped by a low tide between barnacle-encrusted rocks. This is childhood revisited. There are clues to a different ecology, though: ancient aloes cling to the cliff face, dolphins frolic in the waves, eagles circle above. On the clifftop is a Xhosa village where women cook strange brews in vast cauldrons, grind corn into flour and smoke long-stemmed pipes - not at all that much like Cornwall, then, after all. rainbowtours.co.uk 17 North Wales Beauty and a warm welcome... Desmond Balmer, editor of The Good Hotel Guide, extols the virtues of unsung Wales As roads in the Lake District gridlock with traffic in summer, it remains a mystery why so many visitors bypass North Wales. The natural glories - the spectacle of mountains and sea in Snowdonia and the rugged beauty of the Llyn peninsula - are not in dispute. Perhaps it was a perception that the area was in a time warp or that visitors were not welcome - an impression fuelled by images of burning country cottages. Look again. North Wales is coming alive. The love spoons and horse brasses are going; interesting new places have opened; you&apos;ll easily find good modern cooking. Pride in Welsh culture and language is being shared with visitors. Typical of the new order is Neuadd Lwyd, a Victorian rectory on Anglesey given a makeover by Susannah and Peter Woods and run as an upmarket guest house (a silly word; think relaxed country living). Welsh speakers, they are enthusiastic about the area and promote local produce in their meals. The decor is a neat blend of traditional and modern. Further south, overlooking the Glaslyn estuary, is Plas Tan-Yr-Allt, a listed house (built c1800) described by the poet Shelley, who lived here for a year, as &apos;tasty enough for the villa of an Italian prince&apos;. Michael Bewick and Nick Golding, who run it in house-party style, are English, but have the passion of converts for the area. They have renovated with flair: each bedrooms has its own style. The tone is set in the entrance hall (with Philippe Starck ghost chairs), where visitors are welcomed by Percy the parrot. The dishes are locally sourced for a dinner taken round a huge refectory table. For the full Welsh experience try Y Goeden Eirin, a green guest house. John Rowlands, who runs it with his wife Eluned, is emeritus professor of Welsh at the University of Wales. Natural hosts, they are passionate about Welsh culture and the natural and social environment. \u00b7 neuaddlwyd.co.uk; tanyrallt.co.uk; ygoedeneirin.co.uk.

It&apos;s one of the lesser-known Cyclades islands, overshadowed by its neighbour Paros, but at only 78 nautical miles from Piraeus it&apos;s within easy striking distance of Athens. I have been going there for years in my private yacht, and this summer I went twice on easyCruise, as it&apos;s part of our &apos;long weekend cruise&apos;. It&apos;s the perfect place to end the weekend. You get to spend the evening there before sailing a little after midnight and arriving back in Piraeus at 9am. I like Sifnos because it&apos;s so off the beaten track, with very few British tourists. It&apos;s mostly frequented by Athenians who have second homes there. There are plenty of good tavernas in the port (including a basic feet-in-the-sand sort of place where the owner has created a special cocktail named after me), but the main town, Apolonia, which is up the hill, just 10 minutes away, is even better. It&apos;s very different to tourist Greece, because everything is aimed at the local market - all the signs are in the Greek language - and there are several cute bars that are favourites of Athenians who are in the know. easycruise.com 19 Bridport For fossils and food, Dorset&apos;s unbeatable, says James Lohan of Mr &amp; Mrs Smith I&apos;ve been lucky enough to spend a year visiting hotels for our second UK/Ireland hotel guide (published tomorrow), and it has been great to discover some of the new boutique hotels springing up, and to research destinations. I genuinely loved the wild and untamed Jurassic coastline of Dorset. It&apos;s perfect for foodies: a market renaissance has seen Dorset&apos;s bakeries, kitchens and restaurants catching up with its breweries and orchards. It&apos;s neither London-on- Sea trendy nor too remote for a quick getaway, and Dorset&apos;s resorts and countryside are favourites for natural beauty, fair weather and good old-fashioned fun. I recommend trying local specialities like Moore s Dorset Knob biscuits, Dorset apple cake, Abbotsbury rock oysters from the Fleet, Dorset Blue Vinny cheese, Wolfeton cider, and local ales from Hall &amp; Woodhouse (hall-woodhouse.co.uk). My hidden travel tip is Bridport, which is becoming a cultural hub to reckon with thanks to the new Electric Palace, an arthouse cinema and brasserie backed by Richard Eyre, Mike Leigh and local Oscar winner Julian Fellowes (electricpalace.org.uk). Away from the high-street offerings of Weymouth, Bournemouth and Poole, Bridport lives up to its reputation as a market town, with street markets on Wednesdays and Saturdays (explore the antiques and bric-a-brac stalls on lower South Street), an excellent farmers&apos; market in the Arts Centre on the second Saturday of every month, and a monthly antiques and second-hand book fair. The lovely Georgian Bull Hotel, opened about six months ago, has been totally transformed from Fawlty Towers to Farrow &amp; Ball by Richard and Nikki Cooper. Downstairs, the lobby, bar and gastropub restaurant feature lots of stripped floorboards, wood-burning stoves and wood panelling, but modern furniture, with a hint of the Seventies, provides a contemporary injection. The Red Four-Poster Room is the largest and very romantic, with vivid walls, a lavish bed and a vintage roll-top bath. mrandmrssmith.com 20 Lone traveller Cats, cars and courtrooms inform Jan Morris, legendary travel writer, about the cities she loves to explore on her own It is sad but true that my only travelling rule is a rule of utter selfishness: travel alone. My professional purpose in travel is to open my own sensibility to the influences of the place I am writing about, the nuances and the allusions, the exact effects of history that happen to touch my own particular nerve ends. I aim to think about nothing else - all my antennae out to catch the slightest radiation from the subject in hand. This means that I have no time to care for companions. I prefer to leave behind even my most beloved friend, however lonely I may feel, however homesick, in the interests of what I pretentiously like to call my art. Selfish? Egotistical? Heavens, yes. Cities have been my especial destinations, those epitomes of the human condition, and I am often ashamed of myself as I immerse myself in their endless fascinations, really examining not the cities and their peoples at all but only my own self-centred reactions to them. Wandering aimlessly about was EM Forster&apos;s recipe for getting the best out of Alexandria. The wandering I agree with, the aimlessness not entirely. I need a structure to build my writing on, and while my instincts may meander, my senses need some discipline. Here are some of the devices I use as keys to the understanding of my own responses... Animals can unlock many civic mysteries, and through my acquaintance with them I often discover my feelings about the cities themselves. There are places where every cat seems a fugitive: but often you may find, hidden away in shadows, little hordes of fish heads or spaghetti fed them by neighbouring humans. Conversely there are cities whose pavements are full of splendid pedigree dogs, sleek and handsome on their leads, but whose owners are pleased to let you pat their heads not out of love but out of snobbery. And a city where no animals show at all is a city short of some profound empathy, numbed in some part of it, atrophied. I always look at cars, cars on the move, cars parked. How clean they are, how loaded with knickknacks, the things on their back seats, their locking devices, their stickers patriotic or sporting, the way they are parked (forward or backward) - all these matters, recorded in my mind&apos;s eye as I pace the pavements, establish reactions in my subconscious. I always go to the law courts. Not to the higher courts, where murderers are sentenced, but to lesser magistracies where I myself might well turn up in the dock one day. The faces there are grist for my mill - faces of the public, of justices, of relatives, of the accused. In them I like to sense that I am seeing the generic character of the city, betraying all gradations of sympathy, pathos, voyeurism, skulduggery and Schadenfreude. Or I set out to challenge the responses of perfect strangers. One way I do this is by asking people the way somewhere, and then allowing conversation to develop. The Smile Test consists of smiling ingratiatingly at everyone I meet. It is remarkable how civic responses vary, in their degrees of charm or curmudgeonliness. Top in my Smile Test league is San Francisco, where most people are smiling anyway; bottom is Vancouver, not because Vancouverites are disagreeable, but because they are so sensitive that they are never quite sure whether I am smiling at them or at somebody over their shoulder. You see? It is a complicated practice, wandering the world analysing one&apos;s own responses and trying to blend them into some sort of objectivity. The copy of Ulysses lying on the back seat of a Saab in Tokyo may give me inaccurate messages, but is perfectly true in its impact upon me. I may be wrong about the malicious old judge in the Hong Kong courtroom, but malice is certainly what he projects into my view of the city. It&apos;s not an easy way to travel. My responses are often tangled, and people are sure to disagree. But anyway, by then I am snugly at home, alone no longer, boring my beloved with travellers&apos; tales and feeding crisps to Ibsen \u00b7 To read the first part of this article, please click here", "publicationDate": "2007-10-14T22:34:07Z", "tags": ["Life and style"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2007/oct/14/features.magazine107", "title": "Twenty of the British travel elite reveal their best-kept secrets (part two)", "sentences": ["We joined the Spirit of Adventure in Bangkok and headed up the coasts of Cambodia, Vietnam and China, before docking in Hong Kong just after New Year."]}, {"article": "Tennis: Serena reigns in Kremlin semi Serena Williams overpowered top seed Svetlana Kuznetsova 7-6 6-1 to reach her first Kremlin Cup final.

Boxing: Fight breaks out  Japanese boxer Daiki Kameda could face a ban for violent behaviour during his defeat by Daisuke Naito in a world title fight in Tokyo. Naito retained his WBC flyweight belt on Thursday with a unanimous decision over the 18-year-old Kameda, who was docked three points after his patience snapped in the twelfth round. Kameda, sporting golden gloves to match his dyed hair, was docked a point for punching Naito while both men wrestled on the canvas. He was then penalised a further two points for picking up Naito and slamming him down. Daiki, younger brother of Japanese fighter Koki, a former light flyweight world champion, could now face suspension, along with his father and coach, Shiro. &apos;The last round was astonishing,&apos; Japan Boxing Commission general secretary Tsuyoshi Yasukochi told reporters. &apos;We need to examine how this will impact on (Kameda&apos;s) career.&apos; To make matters worse for the controversial boxing family, television microphones picked up Koki, who was in Daiki&apos;s corner, telling his younger brother to elbow Naito in the eye.  Golf: McIlroy hot in Madrid Rory McIlroy remains on target for a remarkable first European Tour victory in only his third event as a professional in the Madrid Open. McIlroy joined the paid ranks only after playing in Britain and Ireland&apos;s narrow Walker Cup defeat in September - but finished 42nd on his European Tour debut in the British Masters at The Belfry. The 18-year-old then turned in a stunning display to finish third in the Dunhill Links Championship at St Andrews last Sunday - a performance that all but secured his card for next season.

Speaking as EU foreign ministers met to discuss proposals for more sanctions against Burma, Mr Brown said the UK would be pressing for &quot;tough&quot; measures. But he revealed that he had written to world leaders proposing an economic recovery package for Burma if democracy was introduced to the country. In a statement, he said: &quot;I want to be clear, if this process of change begins we stand ready, as the international community, to support the recovery of Burma with aid and other support.&quot; In the meantime Mr Brown is pushing for an EU ban on future investment in Burma and sanctions against goods such as timber, gems and metals. He said: &quot;I believe the gaze of the whole world will remain on the Burmese regime as long as people know about the violence being practised against Burmese citizens, the repression against religious leaders and the loss of civil liberties suffered by Aung San Suu Kyi and so many people. &quot;That is why today we will be pressing at the EU for sanctions against the Burmese regime.&quot; He was speaking after receiving human rights campaigners and Buddhist monks who delivered an international petition with more than three-quarters of a million signatures calling on the UN security council to oppose the violent crackdown on demonstrators in Burma. The prime minister welcomed the petition. He said it &quot;sends a strong message that people all over the word will stand with the people of Burma&quot;. He added that human rights abuses were still taking place in Burma following the bloody crackdown against last month&apos;s protests. Last week it emerged that an active member of Ms Suu Kyi&apos;s party had died under interrogation, and more pro-democracy leaders were arrested over the weekend. Earlier today the UN envoy Ibrahim Gambari said that recent reports of arrests in Burma were &quot;extremely disturbing&quot;. Speaking in Thailand at the start of a tour of Asian countries to resolve the crisis in Burma, Mr Gambari called on the junta to halt its crackdown immediately. Ahead of Mr Gambari&apos;s arrival in Bangkok, Burma&apos;s military rulers eased more restrictions imposed after the protests last month. Weekend internet access was restored but a block on foreign news sites remained in place. Mr Gambari travels next to Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan, India and China before returning to Burma. He called for the release of all political detainees, including those who were arrested during the recent protests, and asked for access by the International Red Cross to people in detention. Earlier this month Mr Gambari met Burma&apos;s reclusive leader, General Than Shwe, during a four-day visit in which he also met Ms Suu Kyi twice. Gen Shwe has since agreed to meet Ms Suu Kyi but only if she rejects calls for sanctions and drops her confrontational stance against the regime.

The cut in grants by one of the region&apos;s most influential players follows the EU&apos;s decision to toughen sanctions and signals from the US that it will shortly stiffen its measures against the junta&apos;s leadership. Japan, once Burma&apos;s largest aid donor, said it had decided to cut the funding in response to international outrage over the crackdown. It hoped the move would encourage the regime to change course and work on moving towards democracy. Tokyo had been considering its course of action since the killing of a Japanese video journalist, Kenji Nagai, at the height of the protests. Film of the killing appeared to show him being shot at close range by a soldier. The foreign minister, Masahiko Komura, said Japan was cancelling a \u00a32.3m grant it had been discussing with the Burmese regime for a business education centre at Rangoon&apos;s university. &quot;The Japanese government needs to show our stance,&quot; the minister said. &quot;We cannot take action that would effectively support the military regime at this moment.&quot; The funding cut represents only a small proportion of the \u00a313m in humanitarian aid the Japanese government gave to the regime last year, but the minister said further grants would be reviewed on a case by case basis in future. Up until 1998 Japan was the largest donor to Burma and it remains one of the pariah nation&apos;s most important humanitarian aid backers. But it suspended low-interest loans for big infrastructure projects in 2003 in protest at the re-arrest of the opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been detained for 12 of the last 18 years. The significance of yesterday&apos;s move is that Japan has largely stuck by the generals over the years, in contrast to the sanctions imposed by the EU and US. The shift sends a strong symbolic as well as economic message to the Burmese leadership and may yet encourage countries in the Association of South-East Asian Nations, which numbers Burma among its members and opposes sanctions, to adopt a stronger stance.

With the London Film Festival underway, cine-heads within spitting distance of the capital will already be immersing themselves in its multiple delights. Those hoping for signs of a New Wave to sweep in an era of bolder, braver movies may, however, find themselves disappointed. Or so went the gist of a fine recent post from critic Michael Atkinson at his blog Zero for Conduct, related not to the LFF in particular but to the current ardour among what could be called the Sight &amp; Sound fraternity for all things Romanian - that country&apos;s cinema being the latest to be hailed as the perfect cure for Hollywood&apos;s mind-rot (see also, most recently, Iran circa 1998).  According to Atkinson (and I&apos;m inclined to agree), it&apos;s an unreasonable weight to load onto the slight frames of the sombre, understated films most famously represented by Cristi Puiu&apos;s (excellent) The Death of Mr Lazarescu and this year&apos;s Cannes Palme d&apos;Or winner, 4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days (screening today at the LFF). After all, if one trait seems to bind modern Romania&apos;s movies it&apos;s their willingness to, in Atkinson&apos;s words, &quot;stand in the middle of a lower-class kitchen and record the light honesty and the people without bullshit&quot; - noble ends, God knows, but not enough to make a masterpiece. The problem is, the more aggressively stupid the mainstream (both Hollywood and, I&apos;d venture, certain European cinema too), the stronger the desire for a pure-hearted alternative; in fact, it&apos;s more than a desire, it&apos;s an expectation, our rightful payback for the existence of Evan Almighty and Disturbia. But that expectation doesn&apos;t only stem from raw despair at the multiplex fodder - it also comes out of wanting an easily defined &quot;movement&quot; to range against the villainous studios. And how much easier could it be to define movie-makers than by nationality? But the snag here may be that the very idea of any national New Wave is a relic, that in a world this tech-accelerated and truly global (for good and for bad), the best and most radical film-makers are now unlikely to appear en masse from Bucharest (or Tehran, or Bangkok), but to be getting their inspiration from all corners of film history, with their peers scattered across the planet. So maybe now the unpretty corpse of the Nouvelle Vague can have that much-deserved stake driven through it at last, safe in the knowledge that when form-changing genius does next turn up to save the movies, it&apos;ll almost certainly be doing so alone, and from the last place it might be expected. Anyway, the one thing that will be uniting the refined clientele of the Curzon Soho and the queue for Resident Evil: Extinction this weekend will be that both are going to end up with a bellyful of ads before getting to see what they&apos;ve paid for. Personally, as someone who&apos;s grown violently weary of those inescapable Orange skits (how can you make Val Kilmer unfunny?), it was a pleasure to stumble on this rant from The Movie Blog. Not only is the post dead on in its comparison between the industry&apos;s anti-piracy hectorings and the time-theft of movie advertising, it also seems to me that in the long-term, it&apos;s just one more reason for the next generation to find something better to do. After all, paying a tenner to sit in a draughty/stifling darkened room for two hours must already seem a pretty rum idea to many 10- year-olds - without half an hour of that time being given over to spots for Diet Coke and Renault Clios.

They said the operation would serve as a warning to paedophiles that the power of the internet, and public revulsion, would leave no hiding place. The international police agency revealed Mr Neil&apos;s picture after German computer specialists used cutting-edge technology to unscramble his features. His face had been digitally obscured with a swirl pattern in images showing him abusing boys in Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand. Within days, Interpol had received 350 calls and messages that established his name, age, nationality, passport number, occupation as an English teacher and current and previous places of employment. However, on the day the pictures of Mr Neil were released, he abruptly left the South Korean school at which he was teaching.  He arrived at Bangkok&apos;s international airport, where Thai immigration authorities photographed him, shaven headed and wearing glasses, sparking a nationwide search.

Walking around Manhattan, you&apos;d need to have your head buried in your shoes not to notice the giant billboards of him beaming down with his oh-so-charming smile and silvery blue eyes. There are numerous websites for his fans - Anderfans, as they call themselves - including one called Gunmetal Grey after the startling colour of his hair. He has been on the cover of Vanity Fair, made a cameo appearance on Sesame Street alongside those legends of TV journalism, Dan Rathernot and Walter Cranky, and been profiled by a gay magazine that claimed to out him - a claim he has always sidestepped when it has been raised. At first look, Cooper cuts a rather odd figure as news superstar. He is not one of the exalted group of evening network show hosts, such as CBS&apos;s $15m-a-year anchor Katie Couric. Instead, he is tucked away on CNN between 10pm and midnight - a competitive slot, certainly, but not maximum exposure. And then there is the resolutely serious diet he feeds CNN viewers in his show, Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0, from famines to hurricanes, domestic poverty to African civil wars. He insists that he is oblivious to the adulation. &quot;You probably won&apos;t believe this,&quot; he says when we meet in his CNN office in the glass-and-steel Time Warner building opposite Central Park. &quot;I don&apos;t read stuff about myself and if I can help it, I don&apos;t look at billboards of myself.&quot; When his memoir, Dispatches from the Edge, came out last year, he adds, &quot;I stopped going into bookstores as I thought it would be weird to be seen loitering around my own book.&quot; But beneath the modesty, you might still say Cooper is a man born into greatness. His mother was a Vanderbilt, the family that built the railroads and used its vast wealth to emulate European royalty. He grew up thinking that every small boy&apos;s grandparents turned into statues when they died, which explained why his great-great-great grandfather Cornelius was immortalised in Grand Central station. Charlie Chaplin came to tea and Truman Capote was a regular visitor. Andy Warhol&apos;s white hair scared the young Anderson - how was he to know he would himself turn Gunmetal Grey? With so much fame around him, it seemed the natural thing for Anderson to enter that world himself, and he put himself forward as a child model. &quot;I did a lot for Ralph Lauren and Macy&apos;s - cheesy newspaper ads, that sort of stuff.&quot; But the weird thing is that in the course of our conversation, Cooper seems the antithesis of the man born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He comes across as diffident, almost hesitant, with none of the bombast you&apos;d expect from his Upper East Side roots. Your amateur psychologist could explain that apparent paradox quite easily. Although his background was one of enormous privilege, it was also one of enormous hurt. His mother, Gloria, was the subject of a highly public custody battle as a child that took her away from her own mother. His father, Wyatt Cooper, a writer from Mississippi, died when Cooper was 10. Then the brother. In a heartrending passage of his memoir, Cooper relates how his elder brother Carter committed suicide when he was 21. Carter, two years the elder, jumped from the balcony of the family&apos;s 14th-storey bedroom in Manhattan, with his mother watching. His final words to her were: &quot;Will I ever feel again?&quot; Cooper portrays the event in almost unbearably intimate detail. He talks of the guilt he felt then and for years afterwards about not reaching out to his brother when he was clearly depressed. And he describes the experience of seeing Carter&apos;s corpse in the casket and noticing a silver screw and bolt sticking out of the head. &quot;I hoped my mom couldn&apos;t see it,&quot; he writes. With such tragedy within his family there was only one place to go. The war zone. Aged 24, he just upped and went. In fast succession, he tore around Burma, Bosnia, the famine in Somalia and the Rwandan genocide, filing reports for a news service for schoolkids, Channel One. Wherever there was conflict, he wanted to be there. Back in the comfort of his office, with stunning views over the park, I suggest that many war reporters appear to display this need to dull their own personal pain by experiencing the pain of others. Cooper disagrees with me. &quot;It&apos;s not that you want to witness others&apos; pain, that&apos;s the worst part of the job. It&apos;s more like speaking a language, and you look for other people who can speak it too. I found it difficult at the time to be in New York, where people don&apos;t talk about life and death in casual conversation. I was uneasy at cocktail parties among people making small talk. &quot;I would much prefer to be in a place where people were dealing with life-and-death issues; cut out all the bullshit, all the rubbish, and reveal things as they really are. Places of extreme conflict felt comforting - no, not comforting, but known to me.&quot; Running around the world for Channel One, he perfected a way of telling affecting human stories, and later brought it to a wider audience through CNN. The technique was put to powerful use in 2005, when Cooper spent weeks in the thick of Katrina, broadcasting searing accounts of the local and federal authorities&apos; failure to help New Orleans. To his bemusement, he became known as the reporter who captured the emotion of the disaster, and he was catapulted into TV superstardom. &quot;The irony is I&apos;m the least emotive person I know. I was raised a Wasp, very tightly wound, and I don&apos;t express much emotion at all. I try not to insert myself into the story in a way that many do and always seems to me to be phony.&quot; His latest venture is a four-hour investigation of the global environmental crisis, Planet in Peril. With CNN colleagues Jeff Corwin and Sanjay Gupta, Cooper does his usual act of running around the globe, going undercover in an illegal animal market in Bangkok, hunting poachers in Cambodia, and travelling to Greenland to see Warming Island, a newly created landmass as a result of melting ice caps. After all this globe trotting, of course, he has to return to New York to sit behind his studio desk and broadcast to the nation. He can&apos;t keep running forever, I say. &quot;Sadly, that&apos;s true,&quot; he replies. I ask him how he copes, after struggling through the Amazonian forest, with re-entry to the domestic American media world of celebrity gossip and political soundbites - the cocktail party small-talk that drove him out of New York in the first place. &quot;I find I&apos;m spending fewer and fewer of those days of small-talk,&quot; he says. &quot;You have to resist the rating system. If you start to do your broadcast based on what you think people want to see, then you end up with nothing but OJ Simpson or Anna Nicole Smith or whatever the tawdry subject is. The easiest thing in the world would be to do Anna Nicole Smith stories, but I don&apos;t think CNN viewers want that.&quot; Such resistance to commercial pressures has its costs: his ratings are below his Fox News competitor, Greta Van Susteren, with her preponderance of crime stories, though he has closed the gap among viewers in the 18-34 age group. As his star has risen, there have been other costs on the private side. He has to deal with &quot;four or five&quot; stalkers, he says, as well as persistent gossip about his private life. He was recently profiled in the gay magazine Out as one of the 50 most influential gay and lesbian Americans. Would he like to say anything about that? &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s my job to talk about my private life,&quot; he says. But hang on. His book is the most intimate portrait of family tragedy that I have read for a long time, I say. I might have added that someone who writes about the screw in his dead brother&apos;s head is hardly protecting his private life. &quot;All those things - my brother&apos;s suicide, my father&apos;s death - were in the public domain. To me, I wasn&apos;t writing a tell-all narrative about my life; it was a book about loss, war, disasters and survival.&quot; A more plausible defence, perhaps, would have been that as a journalist who respects the privacy of others, he has the right to retain some of his own. Put that another way: let&apos;s give Anderson Cooper the Anderson Cooper treatment. What matters most - the lurid speculation about his private life beloved of his growing army of Anderfans, or that this is one reporter who, against the odds, continues to strive for significance within the arid world of American television news.

The entire group lost their jobs. When the Clean Clothes Campaign (CCC) received an email from the Metraco workers&apos; representatives about the firings, they immediately responded. Web-networked campaigners at the CCC strive to improve conditions for millions of workers in the global garment industry. From its roots in the Netherlands in 1990, the CCC is now based in 11 western European countries and has on the ground &apos;task forces&apos; in India and Bulgaria. Through investigations and international appeals, they reach out to garment workers and clothes sourcing companies as well as shoppers on the high street. Their emphasis lies in worker empowerment. As Martin Hearson, campaigns coordinator for Labour Behind the Label (LBL), the UK branch of the CCC, explains: &quot;We support garment workers&apos; own efforts to improve their conditions.&quot; This means that campaigners need to have close contact with garment workers around the world. Later this year LBL members will attend an international campaigns forum in Bangkok to meet with garment workers and NGOs from Africa and Asia, and plan future campaigns. Martin recently visited factories in Morocco. As well as responding to the workers&apos; situations, he was able to share his knowledge about conditions in garment factories in other parts of the world, such as China. &quot;The exchange of information is crucial for understanding,&quot; explains Martin. &quot;Brands work on an international level. In turn we need to help build solidarity networks that are international.&quot; Back in the UK, LBL are working with PlayFair organisations ahead of the 2010 London Olympics to secure ethically &apos;clean&apos; merchandise for the games. LBL&apos;s latest campaign lobbies high street stores - such as Bhs, Mothercare, River Island and Kooka\u00ef - to pay garment workers a living wage. On the eve of London fashion week, together with NGOs such as War on Want, LBL published the Clean up Fashion report. Containing detailed comparative profiles, the report aims to shame stores into faring better. Their educational initiative &apos;Fashioning an ethical industry&apos; also goes to the roots of the garment industry, by running programmes in fashion colleges throughout the UK. Educating young people about how their clothes and shoes are made is also central to No Sweat&apos;s strategy. The UK based campaign group has been combating exploitation of sweatshop workers around the world since 2002. The organisation raises awareness through its website and music festivals, and hosts an annual No Sweat conference. Mark Osborn, a founding member, says: &quot;Consumers need to understand the links between how their clothes are made and how the workers are treated.&quot; To promote solidarity and understanding they have funded worker activists such as Dita Sari from Indonesia to travel to the UK and meet consumers and campaigners. However, No Sweat&apos;s campaigns are not solely linked to exploitation in factories abroad. In 2002, they also worked to expose how the clothes sold by Philip Green&apos;s Arcadia group in famous stores such as Topshop were being made in perilous basement factories in London&apos;s east end. In a factory near Whitechapel No Sweat members witnessed fire doors chained shut and air thick with dust from cutting material. In such cases No Sweat puts pressure on the brands sourcing from the factory. As Mark explains: &quot;Contrary to popular belief, we don&apos;t ask brands to stop sourcing from the factory; we ask the brands to carry on using the factories but end the sweatshop conditions.&quot; Many big brands do get involved in pressure for change in response to campaigners. According to the CCC, some of the companies that sourced from the Metraco factory in Istanbul, including O&apos;Neill, Gaastra and Helly Hansen, stopped doing so after independent audits by industry regulators confirmed the workers&apos; claims of harassment, intimidation and the use of the military in the factory. \u00b7 Click here to read about the situation of the Metraco factory workers 14 months on", "publicationDate": "2007-10-23T09:39:23Z", "tags": ["Global development"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/oct/23/internationalaidanddevelopment", "title": "Fashion with a conscience", "sentences": ["Later this year LBL members will attend an international campaigns forum in Bangkok to meet with garment workers and NGOs from Africa and Asia, and plan future campaigns."]}, {"article": "Copperfield cancels Asia dates after sex allegations American magician David Copperfield has cancelled shows in south-east Asia following allegations of sexual misconduct in the US, a Thai organiser said yesterday. Copperfield was scheduled to tour Indonesia Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. The cancellations come days after FBI agents searched his warehouse and a casino hotel in Las Vegas, where the magician regularly performs, following charges that he &quot;forced himself&quot; on an unidentified woman.

Associated Press in Bangkok 37 die and others injured in shoe factory fire A fire at a family-owned shoe factory killed 37 people and injured more than a dozen others, Chinese authorities said yesterday; one of the deadliest industrial accidents this year in a country plagued with dangerous workplaces. The blaze which started on Sunday night in Putian in south-eastern Fujian province, was probably caused by an electric wire that caught fire, said a police spokeswoman. Last year, 14,382 people died in 12,065 industrial accidents, excluding fires, according to official figures. The agency recorded three major blazes in 2006, killing a total of 38 people.

Kundera wrote a letter to culture minister Vaclav Jehlicka expressing thanks for the award, which includes a prize of 300,000 koruna (\u00a37,700). His 1984 novel was first published in the Czech republic last year. Kundera was granted citizenship in France in 1981, where he had been living since 1975. Kundera also said he would not be able to attend Thursday&apos;s ceremony to pick up the award due to unspecified health problems. Associated Press in Prague Sailor kills two women on American base A US navy sailor allegedly shot and killed two female sailors yesterday on a US military base in Bahrain, a navy official said. The alleged gunman was critically wounded in the incident in the barracks at the US base, said the official. He apparently shot himself during the incident, which was limited to the three sailors and was not terror related, the navy reported in a statement. A state department official in Washington said the incident may have been a case of a jilted boyfriend shooting his ex-girlfriend and then himself. It is not clear why the second woman was targeted.

But when not cogitating upon slivers of gorgonzola on rare strains of rucola, they do sometimes dwell on lesser foodstuffs - perfect for travellers on a budget. This week in the blogosphere we have pounced on some of the top food bloggers in their more &quot;for the people&quot; moments. Here&apos;s a taste of the best from Paris, Tokyo, Indonesia, the Czech Republic and beyond ... Paris on the cheap with Pim Born in Bangkok and based in San Francisco, Pim Techamuanvivit is the first lady of the foodosphere, attracting thousands of readers to her prolific Chez Pim blog. Scroll down the righthand side and, in her &quot;categories&quot; section, you&apos;ll find entries on her culinary adventures in Bangkok, London, New York, Paris, San Francisco and Spain. In this post she covers cheap eats in Paris, including &quot;the best fast food in the entire city \u2026 I once had a falafel as appetiser on the way to lunch at Les Ambassadeurs.&quot; Taste of Tokyo Amy Sherman is another San Fran-based food blogger, just back from a short gastro-tour of Japan. In her latest post, she includes links to all the stories she is writing for Epicurious, another top foodie blog. Of her recent tips, the eatery  Hirata Bokujo  is quite a find \u2013 &quot;a little spot with so signs whatsoever wedged between the supermarket and what appeared to be a meat counter. But while it lacked English menus, it had a queue out the door attesting to its popularity. Taking a peak inside, I could see most people were eating what appeared to be tonkatsu, a breaded pork cutlet \u2026 It turned out that the meat counter was attached to the restaurant [which] served different cuts of pork, from the lean to the fatty, all from their own farm.&quot; Sarnies and sweets in New York Big Apple-ites are the most opinionated bloggers of all, including on the subject of grub. There are hundreds of NY food blogs, but the always-excellent New York Magazine&apos;s Grub Street is my pick of the bunch, in particular, its &quot;underground gourmet&quot; section. Here you&apos;ll find a dazzling selection of the best sarnies in the city; the blog recently featured SoHo&apos;s Alidoro and its gut-busting Pavarotti sandwich, dedicated to the big man himself and comprising layered salami, smoked mozzarella, sundried tomatoes, artichokes and sweet peppers, all wedged into a titanic semolina loaf. For desert, the Nigella-esque Orangette ran a great post on finding the best NY sweet stuff on foot, covering eggcakes in Chinatown and gelati on the lower east side, with the author&apos;s &quot;deliciously distracting gelato-eating partner&quot;. Czech, please Czech please isn&apos;t a big name on the foodie blog circuit, but it has been on my radar for a while. Its attraction is threefold. First, the name: the blog is about eating and drinking in the Czech Republic. Second, its author likes to begin his posts with excellent quotes, albeit often only tenuously related to the subject. And third, this guy has Prague nailed, with categories for the various districts of the city and entire tags dedicated to varieties of glorious Czech beer. (Pilsner Urquell gets 20 posts.) His coverage skews towards gourmet food, but this post flags up Bohemia Bagel, a dispensary I can personally vouch for, having gorged on its circular delights on my last visit. Adventures of the Chubby Hubby We finish in the east, where the smashing Chubby Hubby&apos;s blog chronicles the adventures of a portly nosh enthusiast across Asia. This post is a tasty morsel, in which our author is taken to &quot;one of Jakarta&apos;s most popular cult satay stalls. Simply called Sate Ayam, this smoky stall on Jalan Kyayimaja is always busy. We got there around 10am and ended up waiting almost an hour for our two plates of chicken satay. But what satay it was! Easily some of the best I&apos;ve ever had.

While the aviation industry has some insightful arguments in this debate - such as people generally liking flying and wanting to fly more - this &quot;end of the world&quot; effect is a bit of a problem for their marketing departments. Generally they just avoid addressing the issue, talking instead about all the wonderful McJobs they&apos;re creating in Slough and Staines. But if you push them, and let them know you won&apos;t be falling for their usual 2% lie (the government says that aviation is responsible for 13% of the UK&apos;s climate change impact), then they eventually fall back on efficiency gains. More people will be able to fly more often to more places, and that&apos;s OK because the new planes will be more efficient, and so the emissions won&apos;t rise accordingly. Everyone&apos;s a winner. Not so I&apos;m afraid. The IPCC&apos;s special report on aviation predicts the efficiency gains as around 1% a year, while growth is at 4.5% globally, and 7% in the UK. But climate arguments are full of predictions - how about something we can see now? And then here it comes, looming over all of our horizons - the Airbus A380. This behemoth of the skies can carry more than 800 people and, according to the marketing blurb, is as efficient as a &quot;normal&quot; family car, per passenger mile. Well, overlooking the fact that driving a &quot;normal&quot; family car from here to Bangkok for a fortnight wouldn&apos;t be the greenest thing you&apos;ve ever done, are they on to something here? John Stewart, the noted anti-aviation campaigner conceded that they could be:  &quot;If - and of course, this remains to be seen - this new larger plane means you could keep the number of flights the same, or even bring them down, then it would be a good thing.&quot;  The caveat is telling. These new planes are unlikely to be &quot;instead of&quot;, but rather &quot;in addition to&quot; existing fleets. More technically, the standard configuration of these planes is not to have 800 economy passengers, but rather 555 passengers, with a mix of economy, business and first class. Boeing claims that the old 747 jumbo, with 467 passengers, is 10% more efficient per passenger than a 555 seat A380. So, it looks as though this huge leap forward is actually a small shuffle back. But then my attention was drawn to an article that claimed &quot;Singapore&apos;s A380 has no first class&quot;. Perhaps the airline industry was right all along, I thought. Alas no. It turns out they have replaced first class with &quot;suite class&quot; (don&apos;t ask) and this particular A380 carries a less-than-whopping 471 passengers when full.

This year, they all seem to be asking the same question: &quot;Do they recycle here?&quot; Well, yes and no. Thailand is as aware as any country of the debates over carbon emissions and global warming, but environmentalism has yet to dominate bien-pensant dinner-party conversation in the way it seems to have done in London. &quot;I&apos;m not a plastic bag&quot; bags can be seen on fashionable shoulders, but they&apos;re almost certainly cut-price ripoffs of the Anya Hindmarch original, picked up for a couple of hundred baht at a stall in Suan Lum or Chatuchak. And it&apos;s this creative opportunism that really fuels recycling in Bangkok. People recycle because they have no option. They push carts with teetering piles of cardboard, or carry sacks of plastic bottles. What they can&apos;t sell in the raw state, they use for themselves: discarded clothes are reincarnated as curtains; Coke cans are flattened and stapled together to make impromptu sunhats, or toy tuk-tuks. Even unpromising material like polystyrene food trays can be shredded and used to stuff cushions. Bangkok is a grimy, polluted city, but visitors are often surprised by the lack of litter. Anything that&apos;s dumped is snapped up within hours, to be reused, sold or cannibalised: the historic khlongs contain no submerged sofas, fridges or bicycles. The key point to note here is discarded material is recycled without government assistance. Much of the resistance to recycling in the west seems to be based on a distrust of the so-called nanny state, and the British government seems to woken up to the fact that initiatives such as charging for domestic waste, or even spy cameras in bins, would be a step too far. So could Britain, or any developed, western nation, learn something from the laissez-faire Thai model? Clearly there are major social and economic differences between the two countries. The cardboard collectors of Bangkok are slum dwellers whose standard of living is way below that of the poorest Brit. But the core structure is the same in both countries: a rapidly growing bourgeoisie, hopelessly addicted to excessive consumption; and an underclass living on the scraps from the middle-class table. Surely disadvantaged Britons can be presented with incentives to reuse or recycle the detritus of consumer capitalism? We&apos;re constantly told that lack of skills is the main barrier to prosperity among poor people: the dexterity and initiative demonstrated by the poor of Bangkok, fashioning clothes, utensils, even homes from domestic garbage exemplify the sort of attributes that can make all the difference. The odd thing is, though, that this spontaneous passion for recycling isn&apos;t some foreign innovation. I&apos;m not yet 40, and I remember rag and bone men, and getting a penny back for lemonade bottles.

There is adventure in the fresh, raw air: today, we are searching for tigers. Chai burns down my throat as our six-seater jeep leaves behind the smog of Delhi and we wind through the gloriously sweet air of the vast Corbett Tiger Reserve. All around grows an orange weed which devours the vegetation and camouflages the tigers.  &quot;Tiger is only one of many other charms,&quot; warns a wooden painted sign. Who would have thought that going on tiger safari and seeing not a whisker of the great creature could be so much fun, for the reserve is indeed charming in non-feline ways.  The favourite food of tigers - spotted deer and brown deer - wander among gnarled sal trees whose huge branches arch over us. Red-vented bulbuls twitter loudest of the 680 species of birds that flutter through the park. The biggest bird I&apos;ve ever seen, a woolly necked stork, suddenly swoops across the open sky and perches on the pebbles, wriggles its neck as if to a hip-hop tune, braces its body and then vanishes. Black-faced monkeys with long white tails clean each other&apos;s fur. A lizard slithers over a stone. A yellow butterfly pauses on my leg. A pink flower startles the greenness. Cobwebs are stretched between trees.  From the top of the observation tower I can see the whole of Corbett. But the more you search for something, the more it seems to hide from you. Tigers are largely nocturnal and soon the sun is rising and our chances fading. We see their claw-prints dug into trees, their images on postcards, etched in stones, printed on T-shirts. There are tiger marks where the males have defended their territory, wet footprints in mud. But the great elusive cats stay far out of sight.  In this magical place, where signs insist that &quot;Wild animals have right of way&quot;, there is a little restaurant called Tiger&apos;s Den Reserve, and under its thatched roof, marigolds and wind chimes I have lunch with friends - lime soda, chicken masala and roti -and watch a man tending to the buffalo in the field near us.  These past few days we&apos;ve shed the OzBus for Oz minibus, Oz jeep and, as the sun sets on Corbett, Oz elephant, the latter quite the slowest, most ponderous journey yet. (We&apos;ve also shed two OzBusers - they&apos;ve decided to escape for a while by sneaking off to the beach in Goa before rejoining us in Calcutta for the flight to Bangkok.) The elephant grows weary as it heaves itself up the hill and keeps stalling in its tracks and myself and a comrade feel quite guilty to be inflicting our weight on the poor creature.  I wanted to be close to nature but did not expect to have nature slapped quite literally in our faces. A friend valiantly keeps brushing away the huge branches as they thwack, thack, thwack our bodies as the Oz Elephant trundles through the forest. The forest plays tricks on us.

Indeed, there is even a case to be made that the history of the city - from the French Revolution of 1789 to riots in the suburbs of November 2005, via the Commune of 1870 and the student revolt of May 1968 - is no more than one long argument. This is, after all, the city where sitting at cafe tables, smoking fags, drinking coffee or booze, and planning to destroy &apos;society as we know it&apos; was first invented and then made into an art form. I first came here in the Eighties and fell in love immediately with the famous Parisian culture of la contestation (basically an intellectual French justification for having a belting row, usually accompanied by drink) and I have been here on and off ever since, writing books on the city and its people, teaching French (mainly Parisian) literature and always enjoying my immersion into a world where - from the Glorious Revolution to the recent riots - intellectual violence is never that far away from the real thing. But, in recent years, the talk at cafe tables has turned from arguing revolt and revolution to much more worldly matters. Formerly so-called &apos;intellectual quarters&apos; - such as Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s and Od\u00e9on - have become gentrified to the extent that few ordinary Parisians can afford to live there. At the cafe tables where Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir once held court, the talk is of property prices and holidays in the Maldives. Except for the surly waiters, still faithful to the long Parisian tradition of grumpy service, you could easily be in South Kensington - a posh and soulless inner-city enclave for the international super-rich. Across town, in the north-eastern edges of the city, where ordinary Parisians can still just about afford a beer, the talk is, in contrast, focused more often on the mundane realities of city life. More precisely, Parisians are asking whether their city has improved since Nicolas Sarkozy came to power as President in May, promising to rejuvenate a city that in the past decade or so has become a byword for economic stagnation and racial tension. As the Eurostar links improve, Paris is emerging as the hub of a new Europe, with high-speed international links to Germany, Italy and Spain. As such, the city is once again in the kind of central role in Europe that it has always assumed to be its destiny. At the same time, unlike the competing cities of Barcelona, Berlin or Milan, Paris has not been forced to reinvent itself since the Sixties. There is therefore none of the architectural daring that characterises the new Berlin or the truly globalised designer culture of Barcelona. Indeed, after long years of political and cultural stagnation, the big question is whether tired old Paris - once so proud of its status as the so-called the &apos;Capital of the 19th Century&apos; - is even fit for purpose in the 21st century. The problem is that Paris is still beautiful. The city centre is still all 18th-century elegance on the Right Bank - the heart of the heaving nightlife quartier of the Marais is still centred on h\u00f4tels particuliers from that period - and a pleasing jumble of medieval alleyways and long, 19th-century boulevards on the Left Bank. When the Seine is shrouded in autumn mist on the Pont Louis-Philippe, there is possibly no more beautiful or evocative place on earth. But for many Parisians, this kind of picture-postcard scene is precisely the problem. This is all very well for tourists, they argue, but there is a greater danger that, as property prices escalate beyond the reach of ordinary Parisians, the centre of Paris is being left to rich foreigners and inherited wealth. Old Paris is no more, argue social commentators in the pages of serious left-leaning quality journals such as Le Nouvel Observateur and Lib\u00e9ration, and it has been replaced by &apos;Paris Ville-Mus\u00e9e&apos; - Paris as a museum, a place with no living substance. The Marais has been one of the key victims in this process. The area is known as one of the gay capitals of Europe, but its cosmopolitanism is also its undoing. &apos;One of the problems with the Marais is not that it&apos;s gay but that it lacks character,&apos; says the artist Philippe Blondez, editor of the uber-hip art and design journal Bil Bo K, who has his office in the rue des Archives at the centre of the gay Marais. &apos;You can feel too easily that it is just an international gay ghetto. In fact, it&apos;s just like Christopher Street in New York or Old Compton Street in London - it&apos;s fun but its not especially Parisian. You wonder now, in fact, where you can find real Paris. And if we will ever see it again.&apos; In the same vein, across town, Frederika Fenollabbate mourns the slow death of the quartiers chauds (the red-light districts) of the city. Frederika is an up-and-coming novelist who specialises in wildly erotic and elegant texts (her book Apolline Francoeur is a particularly good example). &apos;It is impossible to find good group sex in this city now,&apos; she says, as we eat lunch in Les Bourbons, an ultra-chic restaurant behind the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, where Sarkozy was known to snog and row with C\u00e9cilia. &apos;I think the rave and techno movements were good in the Nineties for introducing hardcore club culture to Paris. But at the same time its oldest traditions of clandestine eroticism started to die.&apos; Worse still has been the influx of well-heeled and youngish upper-middle-class families into the areas of eastern and north-eastern Paris that belonged traditionally to the old working-class. This socioeconomic group, whose members are usually liberal or left-leaning, are called &apos;bourgeois-boh\u00e8mes&apos;, or &apos;bobos&apos; - a term that is almost always followed by an accompanying sneer. &apos;The gentrification of Paris is a reality which is creating bad consequences everywhere,&apos; says Luis de Miranda, a 36-year old editor and novelist who lives in the 13th arrondissement (a place he still reckons is just about free from gentrification). &apos;But the biggest thing is the way it has changed people&apos;s mentalities, the way that they look at the city.&apos; Luis then points out that we are drinking in a bar named for a famous phrase of Arletty - the actress who was the archetypal Parisian working-class girl, an equivalent to Barbara Windsor&apos;s &apos;cockney sparrer&apos;. On the bridge opposite the bar, in the classic Thirties film H\u00f4tel du Nord, Arletty uttered on this bridge the famous lines: &apos;Atmosph\u00e8re? Est-ce que j&apos;ai une gueule d&apos;atmosph\u00e8re?&apos; - &apos;Atmosphere? Do I look like the sort of bird who goes for atmosphere?&apos; - to Louis Jouvet, who was trying to seduce her by promising the &apos;atmosphere&apos; of a day in the countryside. All Parisians know and love these lines as emblematic of the true city-dweller&apos;s contempt for the countryside. The real H\u00f4tel du Nord, which gave its name to the movie, is now a comedy club for visiting UK stand-ups. &apos;This is what we call progress,&apos; say Luis drily. &apos;It means killing the city.&apos; It has been, however, precisely the plan of the city government for some time to revitalise the dying areas of the city. Even more intriguingly, the model for the future of Paris is not London but New York - or at least this is the model that is cited by the likes of Christophe G\u00e9rard, chief adviser to Bertrand Delano\u00eb, the Mayor of Paris. Delano\u00eb himself is openly gay and unrepentantly socialist (although Sarkozy is said to admire him for his determination). Above all, Delano\u00eb has long been impressed by the story of how New York was transformed from a dirty, dangerous and corrupt city in the Seventies to the safe and gleaming consumerist capital o f 21st-century city breaks. Welcoming Michael Bloomberg, Mayor of New York, on a recent trip to Paris in September, Delano\u00eb declared that his city had much to share with and learn from New York. &apos;We want to work with New Yorkers,&apos; he said, &apos;because we share the same destiny.&apos; Certainly, one of Delano\u00eb&apos;s key objectives since he took office in 2001 has been to clean up the city in every sense. He came to power with two grand projects - the first to solve the accommodation crisis in Paris, which has seen large parts of the city depopulated due to high property prices, and to diminish the primacy of the car in favour of public transport. Before he even came to power Delano\u00eb questioned why 94 per cent of Parisian road surfaces should be occupied by private motorists. Since then he has announced, and begun to deliver on, a series of measures making Paris largely car-free and therefore one of the cleanest and most pleasant cities in the world. These included building the first new tramway in Paris since the Thirties, increasing the number of lanes exclusively for use by buses, taxis and bicycles, and restrictions on access to, and parking in, the city centre, all while lowering parking rates in residential areas and introducing a cheap bicycle scheme across the city. At the height of the heatwave in 2003, when it seemed that every breath you took was full of poison, nobody in their right minds could have argued against Delano\u00eb&apos;s vision for cleaning the city. The bike scheme has been a roaring success - it costs only \u20ac1 to hire a bike all day - and it is noticeable that it has been taken up by Parisians of all generations and levels of fitness. There have been teething troubles - everybody is quite happy, for example, to freewheel down the hills of Belleville and M\u00e9nilmontant but no one wants to cycle back, which means discreet lorry-loads of bikes being delivered back up the hill every evening. There are still dissenting voices, however. Strangely, some of the most strident, and occasionally convincing, arguments have come from the left. In March Les Temps Modernes, the journal founded by Jean-Paul Sartre and still an important influence on the Parisian intelligentsia, published two articles fiercely attacking Delano\u00eb&apos;s policies - and, by extension, the ruling Socialist party in Paris. The first of these, by the veteran poet and philosopher Michel Deguy, was called &apos;La Destruction de Paris&apos;. Most significantly, Deguy compares Paris not only to New York and London, but also Cairo, Mexico City, Bangkok and Shanghai, and finds Paris lagging behind. More precisely, he observes the cityscape from the corner of the rue de Rennes and the boulevard St Germain - the crossroads that is at the heart of newly sanitised Saint Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s - and notes, with a rising sense of alarm, the relative calm and lack of movement. So where, he asks, is the noise, bustle, confusion and danger appropriate to a great city? Surely, he says, this cannot be Paris when it looks and feels like no more than a mildly pleasant provincial town? Crucially, Deguy is no Jeremy Clarkson-style petrol-head barking on about defending his right to drive his car wherever he wants in the city. He is, in fact, a dedicated cyclist who sees cars merely as a necessary evil. His real argument - in a rant that has a direct appeal to all Parisians of a leftist bent - is that Delano\u00eb&apos;s measures are a way of controlling and policing the city. More to the point, Delano\u00eb&apos;s attempts to make the city safe and clean are also efforts to make Paris banal. This is a crime, says Deguy, that no true Parisian could condone. The &apos;new green&apos; as represented by Delano\u00eb, Deguy concludes, is a hypocritical puritan who does not understand the inner life of the city. Slightly madder, but no less convincing, is a short piece in the same issue of Les Temps Modernes by the psychoanalyst G\u00e9rard Wajcman called &apos;En Haine de la Ville&apos; (&apos;In Hating the City&apos;). In this article Wajcman accuses Delano\u00eb of a &apos;Soviet-style&apos; authoritarianism driven by a pathological hatred and fear of the people of Paris and &apos;racism&apos; towards motorists, smokers and other free spirits. This may well be going too far - smokers are still beyond being a persecuted race in Paris, as a visit to any bar will prove - but there is a serious point to be made about how far Paris can continue to be Paris if it is ordered and safe, managed by what Wajcman calls the &apos;brutalist thugs of the green movement and their pseudo-science&apos;. One of the ironies of this argument is that while the centre of Paris is probably cleaner and safer than it has ever been in history, the most direct threat to the stability of city life comes from outside the city centre - from the banlieues, the vast suburban housing estates that lie outside the city limits. These estates are home to a population of predominantly African immigrants. Life is tough here and dominated mainly by the grim realities of unemployment, crime and deprivation. These are the areas that exploded into the world&apos;s consciousness in November 2005, when a series of riots in the Parisian suburbs triggered copycat events across France. It&apos;s all too easily forgotten now, but for a month the French government was nearly brought to its knees. That particular confrontation may be over, but the war between the suburbs and the city centre goes on. The latest form of provocation is for kids from the suburbs, dressed like black Americans, but with accents and manners from North Africa, to stage pitched battles in central Paris - Les Halles, La D\u00e9fense or Gare du Nord - terrifying shoppers and workers alike. Like the rhetorical violence in rap music - at which these Parisian suburbanites excel - the aim is to shock the jaded spectator into feeling something, anything. Most recently there have been regular (and often deadly) skirmishes between police and immigrant youths at Gare du Nord and Les Halles, where the suburban trains come into Paris. Trouble happens so frequently here that the shooting by police a few weeks ago of an unknown Algerian youth brandishing a gun near the Euro-star terminal merited only a paragraph in Le Parisien - the equivalent of London&apos;s Evening Standard The social theorist Marc Aug\u00e9 has tried to explain this violence, real and staged, by writing that the edges of the city are now made up of &apos;non-spaces&apos; - shopping malls, car parks, business districts - that contradict everything that central Paris, in its eclectic intimacy, has always represented. The only appropriate response to this contradiction, which defines life in the banlieues, is, he says, alienation or violent rebellion. From this point of view there is, however, still something quintessentially Parisian about these provocations. Indeed, they are all firmly in the tradition of Louis Chevalier, probably the most famous and important historian of modern Paris, who argued that the real history of Paris in the 19th and 20th centuries was made not by government or the bourgeoisie but by what he called &apos;the dangerous classes&apos; - vagabonds, misfits, drinkers, sexual outsiders, anarchists: all those who had no stake in society, and therefore no fear of total disruption. This is an appealing if unorthodox theory that partly explains, even if it doesn&apos;t quite justify, the 21st-century violence from the banlieues. More appositely, such violence can be seen as a sign of vitality and health - it is indeed the direct opposite of the Paris Ville-Mus\u00e9e, the &apos;non-space&apos; where the press and television complain regularly that Parisian culture has been undermined and destroyed by the corporate culture that has brought Starbucks and basketball to the city, wiping out the bistros, tripots and troquets - the bars and dives that are the traditional spaces of old-style urban intercourse. &apos;I don&apos;t condone violence,&apos; says Malik Akbib, an Algerian born and raised in the banlieues, but now resident in the relatively swish 14th arrondissement, &apos;but I know instinctively what these kids are trying to say when they wind up the cops at Gare du Nord or at the football. It&apos;s like saying we belong here, too. You can&apos;t keep us out.&apos; Actually, there is, to my mind and for all this loud debate, every reason to be optimistic about the future of Paris, and precisely because of the views of the likes of Malik. More to the point, the key to understanding the future of the city lies (as Chevalier also indicates in his writings) in avoiding the phoney nostalgia - another typically Parisian trait - that causes Parisians to mourn the passing of their cherished city without noticing that a new city is being born around them. Second, it may well be the case that the future history of the city lies with the banlieues. This, indeed, is the theme of one of the best and funniest books about Paris in recent years - a book that happens to be the work of a Spanish novelist now mainly resident in Morocco. This is the novel Paisajes despu\u00e9s de la batalla (Landscapes After the Battle) by Juan Goytisolo, in which he invents a comic version of the city, whose inhabitants wake one morning to find that Arabic has replaced all signs in the familiar Roman alphabet. It follows from this incident that the hierarchical world of the city is literally turned upside-down, or inside-out. The European capital of modernity can be deciphered only by immigrants from the developing world - the new &apos;dangerous classes&apos; - who are now suddenly the cultural masters of the metropolis. In a neat reversal of the well known Spanish dicho (or proverb) that &apos;Africa begins in the Pyrenees&apos; the narrator of the novel observes that &apos;Africa now begins at the boulevards&apos;. All of this is richly comic, but there is also a serious purpose at work. Most notably, Goytisolo has indicated his real meaning in a brief essay in Spanish called &apos;Par\u00eds, Capital del siglo XXI&apos; (&apos;Paris, Capital of the 21st Century&apos;). In essence, the argument is that Paris has to be completely destroyed in order to emerge as the capital of the 21st century. Goytisolo had in fact spent decades of his life in Paris, mostly living in the Sentier district. This is where the revelation had come to him that the idea of a European capital - made by and inhabited only by Europeans - is not just an anachronism, but a dangerous myth that must be destroyed. The reason for this, he said, is because the purely European idea of the city does not correspond to the reality of the streets. Paris is, for example, one of the biggest African cities in the world. It just so happens not to be in Africa. As I was finishing my own recent book on Paris - a history of the city deeply influenced by Louis Chevalier&apos;s ideas - I went to interview Juan Goytisolo in Tangier, where he lives now, and where we met in the wonderfully named Caf\u00e9 Maravillosa. Goytisolo is now in his mid-seventies, but although lauded across the Hispanic world as the pre-eminent figure in Spanish letters, he has evidently lost none of his combative style or his contempt for middle-class values. Goytisolo said to me that he had always loved the city because he believed that its oldest and truest tradition was the instinct for cultural and political subversion. &apos;Paris is revolt and revolution,&apos; he said, &apos;or it is not at all. That is all I have to say - and why I understand the youth in suburbs. To fight back, to argue hard, is, I think, the oldest tradition in the city.&apos; It was this tradition, he also said, that had been temporarily lost at some point towards the end of the 20th century and that needed to be reawakened. The city had to be &apos;de-Europeanised&apos; in order to make space for new dissident voices. This was in fact the real answer to the problem of the banlieues - the way to bring Paris back to life again is not just in the Delano\u00eb solution of tidying up the city and offering free bikes but to literally break down the borders to the city, bring the immigrants and so-called outsiders into the heart of Paris, where they can start to develop a new, genuinely multicultural and hybrid culture. I told Goytisolo that I thought this was already happening. After the interview I returned from Tangier to Paris, to my flat in Temple, four floors above a Berber coffee shop, next to a building populated by mainly West Africans, and in the heart of what was known as a working-class Chinese district. There I thought about how strange and distinctive Paris still is. In the world of cheap international travel, where everybody travels everywhere when they want, it&apos;s all too easy to forget this. Paris is, however, even in the globalised 21st century, a total and unique experience. The proof of this is in walking the streets. This is the secret to understanding Paris, in its infinity and its detail. One of my favourite walks in Paris is a demonstration of this notion. It begins at the corner of rue d&apos;Oran and rue L\u00e9on in the 18th arrondissement. From this point you can take any number of directions towards the city - towards the market at Doudeauville, or the rue Myrha or rue Polonceau. At any point, depending upon the angle of your vision, you could be in Casablanca, Algiers, Dakar, Tirana, Beirut or the back streets of Bucharest. But you know that you are always in Paris - in the long, grey Haussmann streets, or the cobbled alleys, or the back lanes with their medieval curves and edges, you could never really be anywhere else. And as you continue to walk, down towards the heart of the city, making your way through the crowded and smelly streets of Barb\u00e8s, dodging Bosnian beggars, French junkies and African clairvoyants, picking your way through the Oriental squalor towards the Gare du Nord or the Eurostar terminal, only one thing is sure: the city is changing again.  Plus ca change... A brief history of Paris c4200 BC The first permanent settlement in the Paris area is established. 450 BC The Parisii, a tribe derived from the Celtic Senones, settle near the Seine. 52 BC The Romans conquer the Paris basin and later establish a permanent town called Lutetia. This grows over several centuries to become a major city. c400 AD The decline of the Roman Empire leads manyParis residents to abandon the city. The remaining inhabitants begin calling Lutetia by its original name of Paris. c500 Frankish king Clovis I makes Paris his capital and commissions its first cathedral. 886 Paris survives a siege by the Vikings but much of the settlement on the Left Bank is destroyed. 987 Hugh Capet, the Count of Paris, becomes King of France, marking the beginning of the Capetian dynasty which will establish Paris as the capital of France. 1418 Paris is occupied by English-allied Burgundians during the Hundred Years War. The city is reclaimed by Charles VII in 1437. 1572 Thousands of Huguenot Protestants are slaughtered in Paris during the St Bartholomew&apos;s Day Massacre. The violence spreads throughout France, devastating the French Protestant population. 1789 The storming of the Bastille occurs on 14 July, now a French national holiday. A mob angered by King Louis XVI&apos;s attempts to stifle political change takes over the city&apos;s medieval prison in one of the first flashpoints of the French Revolution. Three years later, the monarchy is overthrown. 1832 A cholera epidemic claims the lives of 20,000 of the city&apos;s 650,000 inhabitants. 1889 The Eiffel Tower is completed for the Exposition Universelle, an exhibition to mark the centenary of the French Revolution. It is planned as a temporary monument. 1940 Paris falls to the forces of Nazi Germany, who occupy the city until August 1944. 1968 Riot police acted against protesting students and workers urge a general strike in an attempt to dislodge the government of General Charles de Gaulle. May 1968 becomes the catalyst for a shift in French society towards more liberal values. 2005 Rioters torch cars and public buildings as the worst civil unrest since 1968 engulfs Paris&apos;s suburbs in October. It is triggered by the deaths of two teenagers who are electrocuted after fleeing from the police into a power station.", "publicationDate": "2007-10-28T23:37:59Z", "tags": ["Paris holidays"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/oct/28/paris.features1", "title": "Paris special: Battle for the soul of the city", "sentences": ["Most significantly, Deguy compares Paris not only to New York and London, but also Cairo, Mexico City, Bangkok and Shanghai, and finds Paris lagging behind."]}, {"article": "Andy Murray&apos;s late surge towards qualification for the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup, restricted to the world&apos;s leading eight players, was given added impetus yesterday with suggestions coming out of the United States that Andy Roddick, the world No 5, will not play in Shanghai. Roddick is due to spearhead his country&apos;s attempt to win the Davis Cup for the first time since 1995 when they meet Russia in Portland, Oregon, less than two weeks after the cup. The American, who lost in the first round of the tournament in Lyon last week and then pulled out of the Masters Series event here in Paris, has not made any official statement as yet, though he has always made it clear that winning the Davis Cup is of paramount importance. There are two places open for Shanghai, and if Roddick were to withdraw it would clearly increase Murray&apos;s chances of making his debut in the lucrative event that will move from China to London in 2009. Murray will not worry one jot how he gets to Shanghai and has high expectations of clinching his place. He made a late decision last week to play doubles here at the BNP Paribas tournament with his brother, Jamie, to give him extra time to adjust to the indoor surface at the Palais Omnisports. &quot;They&apos;ve changed the courts, so this way I&apos;ll get a feel for the surface and hopefully I&apos;ll feel good going into my singles,&quot; said Murray. They are due to play today, with Murray meeting either Finland&apos;s Jarkko Nieminen or Juan M\u00f3naco of Argentina in his opening singles match tomorrow. Murray, having won his third career title in St Petersburg on Sunday, is understandably bubbling at the thought of playing in the Masters. &quot;To be in the top eight players in the world is amazing. There are very few players in any sport who can say they&apos;ve done that.&quot; When the Scot severely injured his wrist last May, forcing him to miss both the French Open and Wimbledon, it appeared the opportunity would be denied him this year but he never gave up hope. &quot;Around the US Open time you don&apos;t really look at it but after that everybody knows what&apos;s going on and what they have to do. You&apos;d have to be dumb not to. Mentally it&apos;s been much easier going into a match knowing that if I win I may make Shanghai. Some guys are a bit tired mentally at the end of the season, while for me the thought of getting to Shanghai has made me fight for every ball, and I&apos;ll be checking what everyone else is doing this week.&quot; Roger Federer, who by winning in Basle at the weekend clinched the end-of-season No 1 spot for the fourth successive year, has already qualified together with Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Nikolay Davydenko, Roddick, and David Ferrer, while the scramble for the final two places has rarely been so crowded or complicated. The key match for Murray may be on Thursday when he is due to meet Djokovic, his fellow 20-year-old and the world No 3, who has won all three of their previous meetings. However for the moment Murray has to concentrate on Nieminen and M\u00f3naco. &quot;I used to train with Juan in Barcelona a little bit so we know each other pretty well. &quot;He&apos;s just had a great middle part of the year. Nieminen I played once before and had a really tough match against him in Toronto a year and a half ago and he&apos;s obviously had a good week by getting to the final in Basle. Both of them are in the top 30 so I&apos;m expecting a tough match either way.&quot; But Murray is currently on a huge high. The terrible frustration of the late spring and early summer months when he was unable to play at all have vanished, and during the penultimate Masters Series tournament in Madrid the form that lifted him into the top 10 before the wrist injury was re-captured and perhaps bettered. &quot;I&apos;m coming here feeling very confident and like I said in Madrid, when I&apos;m playing at my best I&apos;ve got a chance of beating all the top players.&quot; How dearly would Murray love to put this to the test in 12 days&apos; time when the Tennis Masters Cup begins.

Tottering in stiletto heels and miniskirts, young teenage girls criss-crossed the dance-floor as part of a nightly &quot;modelling&quot; show at the Asia Entertainment City nightclub on a recent evening in Rangoon. Some girls stared at the floor while others tugged self-consciously on short hemlines, stretching the flimsy material a few centimetres longer as they catwalked awkwardly to the accompaniment of blasting hip-hop music. Watching these young entertainers of the &quot;Cherry-Sexy Girls&quot; model groups were a few male customers, and a far larger crowd of Burmese sex workers, mostly in their late teens and early 20s, who sat at low tables in the darkness of the club. Escorting several girls to a nearby table of young men, a waiter said the show was not so much modelling as marketing. &quot;All the models are available,&quot; the waiter said, adding that the youngest girls ask $100 (\u00a348.50) to spend a night with a customer, while the older girls and young women in the audience could be bargained down for a lot less. Prostitution, particularly involving children, is a serious crime in military-ruled Burma, but girls taken from the club would have no problem with the authorities, the waiter assured the company, but did not explain why not. It would seem that prostitution is one of the few things the Burmese military, fresh from its recent crushing of pro-democracy demonstrations by Buddhist monks, is still willing to tolerate. Information on the Burmese sex trade is extremely limited, as NGOs and other organisations can not conduct proper research within the country, said Patchareeboon Sakulpitakphon at the Bangkok offices of the international organisation Ecpat, whose acronym stands for End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes. As a result of the restrictions, what is known is limited to a &quot;basic picture based on what victims have said, and information that leaks out,&quot; Ms Patchareeboon wrote in an email. But, she added, the information available indicates that &quot;[child] sex tourism is emerging in Burma as well as the development of the sex industry&quot;. Rights abuses Burma is already a big source country for people trafficked to the regional sex trade. &quot;The junta&apos;s gross economic mismanagement, human rights abuses and its policy of using forced labour are the top causal factors for Burma&apos;s significant trafficking problem,&quot; the US state department noted in its 2007 trafficking report. Disastrous economic policies pursued by the military have hobbled this resource-rich nation and hundreds of thousands have left the country to seek their fortunes elsewhere. With an estimated annual income of just $220 a head among Burma&apos;s 52 million people, fleeing the country to work elsewhere is all too common. For many, their effort to escape leads them into the hands of human traffickers and the sex trade in Thailand, China, Malaysia, Macau and elsewhere, according to the state department. On a recent night in Rangoon, a boisterous group of sex workers trawled a hotel bar for customers. Lin Lin, 22, and Thin Thin, 24 - names commonly used by sex workers in Burma - said they did not normally work in hotel bars, but the 10pm curfew in the wake of the pro-democracy protests had shut down the late-night clubs and forced them to new venues to find customers. With a mother, father and young brothers and sisters to support, Lin said that prostitution was not such a difficult choice. &quot;Sometimes I can earn $40 from one customer,&quot; she explained, speaking in good English. This was just her night job, she said, adding that she was in her second year at university, studying to become &quot;an advocate of the law&quot;. Thin Thin said she was a hairdresser during the day, but sleeping with men, particularly foreign tourists, paid far more than either could earn by legitimate work. With one of the most serious HIV epidemics in Southeast Asia - an estimated 360,000 Burmese people were living with HIV at the end of 2005, according to the UN - Thin Thin said she took no chances, and pulled several condoms from the pocket of her faded jeans to demonstrate. According to the UN&apos;s programme on HIV/Aids, and based on available statistics, one in three of Burma&apos;s sex workers were infected with HIV in 2005. However, the ministry of health&apos;s expenditure on HIV was estimated that year to be around $137,000, or less than half of $0.01 a head, the UN said. Because of the junta&apos;s policies, the country also received a fraction of the international aid given to its neighbours. &quot;Overall, overseas development assistance per capita in 2004 for Myanmar [Burma] was US$2.4, compared with $22 in Vietnam, $35 in Cambodia, and $47 in Lao People&apos;s Democratic Republic.&quot; Now the outlook for ordinary Burmese looks decidedly gloomier in the face of the military&apos;s crackdown. The US and EU have promised more sanctions against the junta and Japan has said it will cut humanitarian aid to the country. New revenues Several people spoken to in Rangoon said further sanctions would have little impact on the military elite, who have lived comfortably for decades and now have new sources of revenues from contracts with countries such as China, France, India, and Thailand to extract natural resources. Ms Patchareeboon said that tougher sanctions &quot;will have a direct impact on children who are already vulnerable, increasing their risk significantly&quot;. The Burmese regime has, at least, joined the Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative Against Trafficking, she said, and the Burmese media have reported on the arrests of traffickers and the stiff jail sentences they receive. So what is shielding the trade in young girls that takes place behind the flimsy facade of &quot;modelling&quot; shows in Rangoon from the military regime&apos;s wrath? The answer is as simple as it is obvious, Ms Patchareeboon said: money. &quot;I am sure that [the military] has officials making profit from the growing sex industry and trafficking of Burmese citizens abroad,&quot; she said. &quot;Corruption and the institutionalisation of the sex industry is common.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-10-30T02:54:16Z", "tags": ["World news", "South and Central Asia", "Sex trade", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/30/burma.international", "title": "Child prostitutes available at $100 a night: the human cost of junta's repression", "sentences": ["Information on the Burmese sex trade is extremely limited, as NGOs and other organisations can not conduct proper research within the country, said Patchareeboon Sakulpitakphon at the Bangkok offices of the international organisation Ecpat, whose acronym stands for End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes."]}, {"article": "Former rebel leader and heroin kingpin dead at 74 Khun Sa, the former head of a guerrilla army once described by the US as the world&apos;s largest producer of heroin, has died in Burma aged 74.

The sea around the island, situated just off Kep on Cambodia&apos;s south coast, is as still as glass and perfectly reflects the sky, which is divided into bright gleaming stars on one side and, on the other, the flashes and crackles of the sudden electric storms that characterise the end of the rainy season. But the real revelation comes from below once you begin to wade in. The still dark water immediately lights up into a multitude of tiny blue-green sparks, fizzing and flickering around your hands and feet. Every splash produces its own new explosions; every dive leaves an eerie glowing trail. It&apos;s like being surrounded by a swarm of underwater fireflies, buzzing through your fingers and flitting right by your eyeballs if you submerge. Sure, on a marine biology level it&apos;s just plankton emitting tiny bursts of phosphorescence on contact, but in the context of this beautiful tropical island, it&apos;s nothing less than mesmerising. On the first night we experienced it, the effect on our little international band of castaways was one of wide-eyed amazement: &quot;Het is absoluut magisch!&quot; gasped one, &quot;That&apos;s astonishing, awesome!&quot; &quot;C&apos;est superbeau. C&apos;est superbeau!&quot; After decades of war, Cambodia is enjoying a dramatic resurgence as a tourist destination. It&apos;s a boom that is being fuelled as much by the temples of Angkor as the immense potential locked in the country&apos;s magnificent south coast, which sweeps down along the Gulf of Siam, reaching from Koh Kong and the border with Thailand in the north right down to Vietnam. Strewn with fine, white slivers of beach and spattered with tiny, unexplored islands, the region is, variously, the &quot;Next Goa&quot; or the &quot;Cambodian Phuket&quot;, depending on which gushing report you read.  But, for the moment at least, much of this lost coastline is entirely free of the kind of the tourist development that afflicts Thailand and many other seaboard Asian countries. Instead of blank holiday apartment blocks or marble-clad hotels, you&apos;re more likely to find yourself staying in bamboo huts teetering on stilts (as we did on Koh Tonsay) or atmospheric little guesthouses. And the locals - quite miraculously, given the enduring levels of poverty - remain captivatingly friendly, with children chiming out &quot;Hello&quot; at every passing traveller. But at the same time, it&apos;s far from an entirely carefree holiday option. This part of the country was among the last places to be fully liberated from the grip of the Khmer Rouge and the scars are everywhere. This is a coastline haunted by powerful and violent ghosts. We fly into Siem Reap, but after three days basking in the daunting magnificence of the temples of Angkor, followed by a couple more in the dusty tumult of Phnom Penh, my wife and I are weary of the overwhelming heat and are beginning to share the same craving: sea, sand, glistening water ... So we board a decrepit old bus for the juddering five-hour journey to Kep. The shanty towns of the capital soon melt away into broad gleaming rice-fields, then jagged mountains before, finally, the sea-front at Kep swings majestically into view. Founded in the 1920s, Kep-sur-Mer was once French Cambodia&apos;s premier resort. Period pictures show schoolgirls skipping down the driveways of grand white villas with manicured lawns. After independence in 1953, Kep remained a favourite of King Sihanouk who built an opulent summer house on the sea.  Decades of civil war and the ferocious destructive instincts of the Khmer Rouge, however, have taken a devastating toll. The deco villas now stand charred and gutted, pocked by bullet holes and mortar fire. But one thing that the guerrillas didn&apos;t manage to destroy was the natural charm of the place: the glimmering turquoise waters, the throng of little islands, the twilight conflagration of its sunsets. The French called this area La Perle de la C\u00f4te d&apos;Agathe - and that&apos;s pretty much what it remains.  Another bonus of the indestructible beauty of Kep is that foreigners tend to fall in love with it, stay and open delightful little places to stay.  On the peninsula, there is an understated designer place called the Champey Inn and, on the hill, a clutch of quaint little thatched bungalows called the Veranda Natural Resort, all connected by a web of gnarled wooden walkways. We opt for the Beach House, a beaming new building vaguely in the French colonial style right on the shore. It&apos;s just a few steps away from the town&apos;s kilometre-long crescent of beach. When the evening storms descend, guests can relocate to the hotel pool for what amounts to an all-over monsoon Jacuzzi.  On our first day, we hire bikes and tour along the peninsula and the immensity of the seafront. The deserted road carves its way between untouched jungle and the limpid water. We stop for lunch at one of the town&apos;s shack restaurants, and lap up crab soup practically in the middle of the street. But it&apos;s difficult not to gravitate to the ruins and we end up at Sihanouk&apos;s destroyed villa, where a women camping in the gutted front room tells us she is &quot;minding it for the king&quot;. For a dollar, she gives us a tour. Climbing on to the balcony, we survey both the destruction and the dazzling view across the delicate arc of the bay.  We had planned just a day trip to Koh Tonsay - otherwise known as Rabbit Island - the following morning, but news that there are &quot;bungalows&quot; there for rent prompts us to pack a few things for a longer stay. As the longboat shears through the water, we can first make out only a blob of jungle, then a halo of coconut trees, then a little bow of sand and a row of thatched roofs and finally, we see a little motley band of locals and foreigners lolling on the sand. We&apos;re shown to our room: a bamboo stilt-hut just a few metres from the water. During the Sihanouk years, Koh Tonsay was used to intern criminals - but it&apos;s now home to six or seven law-abiding families who make their living growing coconuts and fishing. The view in any direction is sublime. The feeling of isolation is intoxicating. The local inhabitants are unnaturally chilled out. The sunsets are transcendental. In the evenings, we feast on fresh boiled crab plucked from the sea just moments before. At night, everyone builds a fire and exchanges stories of their travels over cans of Angkor beer. As a finale, there are the breathtaking underwater performances of the glowing, sparkling plankton. Most people come for an afternoon and stay a week or two. We would have done the same, but our schedule dictated otherwise and after just two blissful days, we are waved off by everyone on the island. Our next destination is the run-down riverside town of Kampot, just 20km up the coast, which once supplied its sweet pepper to practically every French restaurant on the planet. It too is enjoying a revival, thanks to a smattering of new foreign-owned bars and guesthouses along its charming, languid riverfront. We check in to the Bokor Mountain Lodge and relax into its white-washed French colonial elegance. People don&apos;t come to Kampot for the rather grotty town itself, but for the gruelling trek up Bokor mountain, now a national park boasting elephants and tigers and cobras. It&apos;s also the site of Bokor Hill Station, a 1920s gambling resort that became a guerrilla stronghold and, in 1979, hosted a six month stand-off with the Khmer Rouge. The 40km journey to the top takes two hours by pick-up: landmines have reduced the surface of the road to a mass of boulders and craters with just the occasional gobbet of tarmac.  But it&apos;s all worth it. When the mists come down, the old buildings - the casino, the Bokor Palace Hotel (HQ during the battle of the troops) and a dainty little Catholic church (where the Khmer Rouge were holed up) - are said to look like ghostly apparitions. Even on a clear day, they&apos;re spooky and unsettling. Equally compelling are the very reasons why the French chose this as a retreat in the first place - the rolling forests, the gushing waterfall tumbling down the mountain which the Khmers call Popokvil, or Swirling Clouds. And then there is the most enthralling view in all Cambodia: the whole spellbinding coast spanning practically from Thailand to Vietnam. Next morning, we set off for our final destination on the coast: Sihanoukville. Gouged out of the jungle in 1955, this town is about as close as the country gets to a fully fledged resort town. With a half-dozen terrific beaches, stunning islands and nearby Ream national park, Sihanoukville has the capacity to be Cambodia&apos;s coastal gem. In the 60s, Jackie Onassis was one of its many celebrity admirers. But tatty, soulless development has reduced it to a charmless place. Even the Sokha, the country&apos;s first five-star beach resort, can&apos;t save it.  We escape by long-boat to Koh Russei, or Bamboo Island, to laze around on its golden squiggle of a beach and snorkel around its reefs. But the 40 or so other tourists make Bamboo Island seem impossibly crowded, so we venture one island further to Koh Ta Kiev, which proves almost entirely, eerily deserted. With its immaculate white sand half-moon beach washed by clear cobalt waters, it&apos;s perhaps more beautiful than Koh Tonsay. Alone on the beach, we swim with fiery orange starfish and then end the day with an incandescent sunset. Later on in our three-month trip, in the relative comfort and sophistication of Thailand, we couldn&apos;t help pining for the simplicity of Kep or the sublime isolation of the islands. This is one of the few stretches of virgin coast left in Asia. But given the scale of the Cambodian boom, it is certain not to remain so for very much longer. No one could argue against renovation of the villas at Kep or the casino at Bokor. But plans are also afoot to develop Koh Ta Kiev into a resort; and even Koh Tonsay isn&apos;t safe. It remains to be seen whether the garishness of Sihanoukville or the character and individuality of Kep will be the template. Either way, the coast is changing at breakneck speed. Our hotel in Sihanoukville was brimming with Australians, Brits, Swiss, all debating which chunk of island real estate to snap up. In just a few years&apos; time, many of the sights described in this article will have changed irrevocably. If you want to experience the coast of Cambodia in its raw, elemental and often dazzling natural state, don&apos;t wait a moment longer.

Here we are, half-way through, but the middle of the road is much like a mid-life crisis (or my mid-20s quarter-life crisis): you begin pondering the path you&apos;re taking. Should I change direction? When I awake from this dream, should I return to real life or remain on the road?  Such questions rear their heads as unfavourable weather makes it too dangerous for us to travel the fabled Friendship Highway joining Nepal and Tibet, so we must backtrack to India and fly from Calcutta to Bangkok.  Only days earlier we were in Varanasi, the perfect place to cleanse bad karma. Our guide insists we offer prayers to Mother Ganga, so I rise with the early birds of the bus and take a boat ride across the Ganges. I place my marigolds and candle on the river and whisper my wishes to the water - health, happiness and a shoulder massage from a Certain Someone Who Shall Not Be Named. My flame is promptly blown out.  &quot;Every second, try and enjoy yourself. Be strong. Life is full of happiness,&quot; counsels the loquacious guide. &quot;If I keep talking too much, stop me,&quot; but his sermon is instead cut short by a voice bellowing, &quot;NAMASTE, GANGA MARKET,&quot; and I turn to see a small child in a jewel-filled boat and glittering beads thrust before me. &quot;Very nice corals?&quot; he asks, but as I reach for my rupees, the river carries us far away. It is 6.19am and the sun smudges the sky, bodies are being burnt on funeral pyres on the ghats, the town awakes.  That night, under a full moon, four of us discover the heavenly Music Paradise Hall where classical Indian music resounds, carefree notes from flute, drum and sitar. &quot;Everybody happy?&quot; asks the tabla player and, for these moments, we are.  But 20 hours on a roller coaster bus journey from Varanasi to Kathmandu, past small children carrying great golden haystacks on their heads, is the last straw for some. The road takes its toll on minds and bodies, and in Kathmandu the group will split: some will rejuvenate here before reconvening in Bangkok; others will venture independently into Tibet, rejoining in Ko Samui; a couple might leave for good, patience ground thin by the relentless turning wheels; only a handful, it seems, will stay on the bus for the bumpy ride to Calcutta.  I can&apos;t decide anything until I&apos;ve dragged my flu-ridden self to a pharmacy. We&apos;re flying round Mount Everest tomorrow and I&apos;ll be damned if this bug keeps me earthbound. In the internet cafe, a power cut (as regular here as rain in Manchester) snuffs out my words, yet ignites conversation with the boy next to me, volunteering at an orphanage, and soon sparks are flying. Bob Marley wailing from the nearby Reggae Caf\u00e9 tempts us inside and, having not stepped foot in a proper bar since leaving Europe, I drool over the cocktail menu. A Screwdriver? Singapore Sling?

He stole his first movie camera, he told me, when he was a student at the University of Munich, in the early Sixties. Herzog&apos;s directorial career was tumultuous from the start. His first full-length feature, Signs of Life - a satirical precursor of Aguirre, in which a German paratrooper becomes unhinged while stationed in the Aegean - was nearly upended because of what Herzog calls &apos;a confrontation with the Greek military&apos;. He said, &apos;It was 1967. Three weeks after we started shooting in Greece, on Kos, there was a coup d&apos;etat in Athens, and the new regime didn&apos;t like the tone of my script.&apos; His shooting permits were revoked. Herzog told a local army officer that he would continue filming illegally, issuing a threat worthy of Pushkin. &apos;I will not be unarmed tomorrow,&apos; he said, and the first officer who touched him, he promised, would be shot dead. It was a ruse, and it worked: soldiers hovered but did not interfere. &apos;After all this, my lead actor fell six feet or so and fractured his heel bone,&apos; he continued. &apos;The production was shut down for six months. Six feet, six months! It was as if I somehow attracted bad luck.&apos; Herzog can always point to some external force to explain his calamities. &apos;When I was shooting Fitzcarraldo, did I cause the drought that left the boat stuck on the mountain-top for months?&apos; he asked me. &apos;Did I invent that coup d&apos;etat in Greece?&apos; Perhaps not, but in 1970, while making Fata Morgana, a fantasia on scorched African landscapes, Herzog went to Cameroon a few weeks after a coup attempt took place. The police arrested him, Herzog says, after misidentifying a crew member as a wanted criminal. He and several crew members were beaten and thrown into a cell with &apos;60 other men&apos;. Herzog contracted bilharzia, a blood parasite. Herzog was born in Munich in 1942. The disaster of Nazism, he said, informs his brooding world view. &apos;I try to understand the ocean beneath the thin layer of ice that is civilisation,&apos; he said. &apos;There&apos;s miles and miles of deep ocean, of darkness and barbarism. And I know the ice can break easily.&apos; When he was a few days old, he says, he was nearly killed after Allied bombs caused a skylight in his nursery to shatter; the shards fell around his cot but somehow did not injure him. (The image seems suspiciously apt - chapter one in a life story defined by near-misses - but he insists that his mother, Elisabeth, &apos;talked about this many times&apos;.) Elisabeth, a biologist, feared more bombs, and she moved the family to Sachrang, a remote village near the Austrian border. His father, Dietrich, also a biologist, was conscripted into the German army, and eventually abandoned the family. Herzog does not like to speak of him. Herzog adored his mother, who died in the Eighties. Elisabeth was &apos;very courageous&apos;, he said. &apos;She raised three boys on her own, in desperate circumstances.&apos; They had no money for mattresses, so she made pallets by stuffing linen sacks with dried ferns. When Herzog developed a fascination with guns after discovering an old cache of Nazi weapons in the forest, she demonstrated how to shoot a pistol. She understood his impatience with traditional schoolwork - as a teenager, Herzog, an enthusiast for American matinee fare such as Dr Fu Manchu and Zorro, had already begun writing screenplays - and secured him an apprenticeship at a photographer&apos;s lab, in Munich. Later, she gave a German newspaper a quote that Herzog considers the most precise summation of his talent. &apos;Everything goes into him,&apos; she said. &apos;If it comes out, it comes out transformed.&apos; Herzog remains close to his siblings: Tilbert, his older brother, a finance executive, who now spends much of his time on a yacht off Spain; Lucki, his younger brother, who lives in Germany and has produced many of Herzog&apos;s films; and Sigrid, his sister, an acting teacher, who also lives in Germany. Herzog recalls his childhood with a curiously anthropological cast, as if he were the Alpine equivalent of a Trobriand Islander. He loves to say that he never made a phone call until he was 17, did not see a banana until he was 12, and did not watch a movie until he was 11. The film was a documentary about Eskimos, shown at school; Herzog was appalled by their inept igloo-construction technique. Like many children in Sachrang, he played winter sports and wanted to be a champion ski jumper. He gave up the sport, however, when his best friend fractured his skull while they were practising alone on an isolated ramp. &apos;I thought that if I moved him an inch, his brain would spill out, he was so badly injured,&apos; he recalled. In 1973, Herzog made a documentary about the sport, The Great Ecstasy of the Wood-Carver Steiner: in it, he clips off the landings from his slow-motion footage, creating an uncanny sensation of human flight. Growing up in Sachrang, Herzog developed a passion for wandering; as he grew older, he sometimes roamed so far that he had to spend the night in an empty chalet. (He says he&apos;s great at picking locks.) In the Minnesota Declaration, a whimsical manifesto that he presented at a Minneapolis film festival eight years ago, he says, &apos;Tourism is sin, walking on foot virtue.&apos; Herzog believes that modern life has disconnected humans from their most elemental pleasures. His films, accordingly, attempt to connect modern cinemagoers to their prelapsarian selves: the emotions are always primal, and landscape is integral to the drama. &apos;You will never see people talking on the phone, driving in a car, or exchanging ironic jokes in my films,&apos; he said. &apos;It is always bigger, deeper.&apos; He avows that his films expose &apos;the ecstatic truth&apos; of mankind. He is gently messianic in his anachronistic habits. In 1974, upon hearing that the film critic Lotte Eisner, a friend, was gravely ill in France, he walked from Munich to Paris to visit her. (She survived the three weeks that it took him to get there - and lived nine more years.) Four years later he published Of Walking in Ice, a celebration of his travail. As always, he is an astute observer - crossing a field, his feet &apos;immediately collect pounds of heavy sticky clods of earth&apos; - yet the book feels overwrought and musty. (&apos;A cornfield in winter,&apos; he intones, &apos;is a field called Death.&apos;) Werner&apos;s brother, Tilbert, has said his sibling &apos;will openly declare that he writes the best prose since Kleist&apos;, but cinema serves Herzog better: it forces his Romantic sensibilities into a modern frame. Things rarely turn out well when the swashbuckling side of Herzog takes over. Several years ago, he returned to the Alps to ski with some friends. One day, he sped down a notoriously treacherous run; when he boasted about it that night, nobody believed him. The next day, he insisted on doing it again - and, predictably, he wiped out. &apos;I nearly died,&apos; he told me, and he still has difficulty turning his neck. Why does he do such things? Herzog does not want to know the answer. &apos;I think that psychoanalysis is one of the great evils of civilisation, even worse than the Spanish Inquisition,&apos; he told me. &apos;At least the Inquisition was about keeping something together. Analysis is only about taking a person apart. I would rather die than see an analyst.&apos; Herzog&apos;s accidents and misfortunes have been widely catalogued, yet a complete concordance seems impossible: that afternoon in Los Angeles he revealed that he once jumped out of a third-floor window in Pittsburgh - no fire, just fooling around! - and recalled that, during a recent visit to Spain, Tilbert had, on a lark, set his shirt on fire with a cigar. (He was saved &apos;by a pitcher of lemonade&apos;, he added triumphantly.) Not surprisingly, Herzog has been accused of being a serial fabulist. He hasn&apos;t helped matters by admitting that he &apos;intensifies&apos; his documentaries. Lessons of Darkness, his spectral 1992 film about the apocalyptic fires that raged after the Gulf War, begins with a bogus epigraph, allegedly by Pascal: &apos;The collapse of the stellar universe will occur - like creation - in grandiose splendour.&apos; (The &apos;pseudo-quote,&apos; he has said, elevates the film from &apos;mere reportage&apos; to &apos;the realm of poetry&apos;.) He frequently supplies his subjects with dialogue. In The White Diamond, which came out in 2004, a Guyanese villager, interviewed on the edge of a clamorous waterfall, establishes his mystical temperament when he says to the camera, &apos;I cannot hear what you say for the thunder that you are.&apos; Herzog swiped the line from Cobra Verde Herzog says that he &apos;stylises&apos; his documentaries only when the subject agrees that an invention illuminates his character. Grizzly Man, made after the death of Timothy Treadwell, contains no fictions: &apos;there was no possibility of collaboration&apos;. Yet Herzog&apos;s insistence that there is no meaningful difference between his features and his documentaries - &apos;In both cases, I am a storyteller,&apos; he likes to say - offends advocates of cinema verite and may explain why Grizzly Man, despite receiving terrific reviews, was snubbed by the Academy Awards. Herzog, of course, relishes tweaking the traditionalists. &apos;There is just a very shallow truth in facts,&apos; he told me. &apos;Otherwise, the phone directory would be the Book of Books.&apos; Weird things happen to Herzog even when he&apos;s at home in California. One day this February, he left a voice message. &apos;I have something amusing to tell you,&apos; he said, teasingly. When I called back, he announced, &apos;I was shot today!&apos; He tore into his latest tale: &apos;A BBC television crew came to see me in Laurel Canyon. They wanted to interview me for the British premiere of Grizzly Man. I didn&apos;t want them to film right outside my house, so we went up to Skyline Drive. In the middle of the interview, I was shot with a rifle by someone standing on his balcony. I seem to attract the clinically insane.&apos; A rifle? &apos;Well, it must have been an air rifle or something. I was very slightly injured; it was a very small-calibre thing, I suppose. Also, I had a catalogue in my jacket pocket, which protected me. The bullet hit my abdomen, right next to the belt, but it did not penetrate into my intestines. I thought the camera had cracked and burnt me. I flinched for less than a second and continued my thoughts, and the BBC people started to duck and run away. I was bleeding into my underwear! Quite often, I have the feeling that when I tell about some strange incident, people don&apos;t believe me. But here it is, documented on camera. Proof!&apos; Two days later, an article appeared in the Los Angeles Times. The actor Joaquin Phoenix had flipped his car on a drive down the serpentine roads of Laurel Canyon. &apos;I remember this knocking on the passenger window,&apos; Phoenix told the Times. &apos;There was this German voice saying, &quot;Just relax.&quot; . . . I said to myself, &quot;That&apos;s Werner Herzog!&quot; &apos; Phoenix, who was unharmed, went on, &apos;I got out of the car and I said, &quot;Thank you.&quot; And he was gone.&apos; As the Rescue Dawn shoot neared its end, Herzog sent notes via email; they were invariably stippled with words like &apos;brink&apos;, &apos;precipice&apos;, and &apos;abyss&apos;. Crew members confirmed that the set had grown increasingly troubled. Stuntman Chris Carnel burnt his face in a scene depicting Dengler&apos;s plane crash. Although American and British crew members were finally given money, many said that they had not been paid all they were promised, and the producers evidently infuriated Thai contractors by ignoring bills. The entire production crew got turned away from a hotel in Krabi, after the proprietors got wind of these complaints. (Steve Marlton claims that the hotel had suddenly raised its rates, and that all other bills had been paid.) An accountant arrived on the set, then immediately quit, shocked by the financial mess. Midway through the shoot, 30 Thai crew members quit en masse, citing the production&apos;s &apos;cash-flow problems&apos;. A few days before shooting was scheduled to end, Thailand&apos;s governor of tourism revoked the production&apos;s work permits. Marlton had refused to pay the fee demanded by a contractor who had arranged the rental of military equipment and provided the local crew, claiming he was being overcharged. In retaliation, the contractor successfully petitioned the government to close the shoot. Over the next few days, Marlton and eight crew members were prevented from boarding planes at Bangkok airport. Marlton was informed by the Thai police that he would be allowed to leave only if he paid $500,000 in taxes that the production supposedly owed. Herzog, however, eluded capture: &apos;I had two valid passports, and juggled them at a critical moment,&apos; he told me. Marlton paid a substantial sum and flew home, leaving the other crew members behind. After a week-long stand-off, Gibraltar agreed to pay the Thai authorities more money, and the others were allowed to go home. Soon afterwards, Knapp was arrested in Bangkok, on the ground that Rescue Dawn had violated work-permit regulations; he spent eight hours in a detention centre, and criminal charges were filed against him. Marlton posted his bail, but Knapp is still facing legal proceedings. Meanwhile, Rescue Dawn remained in a precarious state. In November, Herzog spent two days in Alameda, California, shooting the final scenes. He then asked for 10 weeks to edit the film. He would present his cut, and the producers would decide whether to release it or demand changes. On the second day of editing, Herzog was kicked out of his small editing suite, in West Hollywood. The editing studio required payment upfront, and Gibraltar didn&apos;t have the money on hand. In April, Gibraltar secured post-production money, and Herzog was finally paid his director&apos;s fee. Herzog resumed editing, and he was joined by Knapp. Although Knapp said that Rescue Dawn was &apos;Herzog&apos;s movie&apos; and that his primary role was to &apos;lend support&apos;, he would also remind Herzog that certain choices - such as trimming action sequences in favour of dialogue-heavy scenes in the prison camp - would likely displease the producers. Herzog was cautiously optimistic. He had realised too late that, as he told me, the producers &apos;would have rather put me out of the project if they could have&apos;. But he wasn&apos;t altogether na\u00efve about Hollywood politics. He reminded me that the powerful Endeavor Agency, which represents Bale and Zahn, was on his side. &apos;Christian wants a quality film, not an action movie,&apos; he said. &apos;And the agency wants their client to be happy.&apos; Endeavor, he implied, could make life difficult for Gibraltar if it tried to release a bastardised version of Rescue Dawn He was also heartened by what he had seen in his brief visit to the editing suite. His footage was &apos;very, very strong&apos;, he said. In a scene in which Bale appears to eat a live snake, a single-take shot made clear that the emaciated actor had struggled heartily with a writhing beast. The sequence shot in the river was excitingly disorienting, bobbing the viewer up and down. Shots of the Thai jungle felt palpably constrictive - at one point Bale and Zahn, after clambering up a steep hill, get their first glimpse of a wider view. The vista before them, partially obscured by branches, is an Edenic blanket of green, but the effect is deflating: this prison cannot be escaped. The sequence was shot the day after the decapitation scene. Herzog had discovered that there was nothing pending on the shooting schedule, and he seized the chance to flee the Apparatus. He got in a silver van with his wife, Bale, Zahn, Zeitlinger, and a camera assistant. The van&apos;s driver had decorated his vehicle in a weirdly apt style: its exterior and interior were plastered with Batman logos. Herzog told the driver to start driving &apos;toward Burma&apos;. The driver, looking a bit unsure, set off down the highway. The sound engineer and a few Thai crewhands followed in a small car. Herzog had explored the border area earlier in the summer, and he had pinpointed a splendid spot to shoot the vista scene. He hadn&apos;t, of course, marked it on a map. &apos;I am just following my own geographic instincts,&apos; he explained. An hour-and-a-half later, Herzog had still not found his spot. We passed steep hills terraced with corn plants. Nobody commented on the cheery rainbows glowing over the misty valleys; in a Herzogian world, rainbows would not exist. At one point, Bale asked quietly, &apos;Werner, does the driver speak English?&apos; &apos;No,&apos; Herzog said, unperturbed. &apos;He has a GPS in his head,&apos; Zeitlinger whispered to me. &apos;Do not worry.&apos; Herzog was savouring the hunt. He propped his muddy bare feet on the bench where Bale was sitting, put on some mirrored glasses, and stared out the window, studying the landscape. We drove for two hours more, looking for Herzog&apos;s vista. The sun was getting low. &apos;We just need a little bit of luck,&apos; Herzog said with excitement. &apos;I think that 10 minutes away there is a spot where we may have some luck.&apos; Half an hour before sundown, a towering escarpment came into view. &apos;Here,&apos; Herzog said. The Batvan stopped, and Herzog began walking up to the summit. &apos;We must go quickly,&apos; he urged, disappearing in the trees. The crest was densely forested, but there was a thin opening that showed a ribbon of mountains receding into the distance. Herzog began giving instructions to Bale and Zahn, who listened in silence. &apos;A storm is coming,&apos; Herzog observed, pointing toward distant clouds. &apos;There is no time to waste.&apos; Zeitlinger wanted to set up a tracking shot; the faraway terrain might look blurry in an unsteady handheld shot. Herzog humoured him for a few minutes, until he noticed a mountain that was backlit with a penumbra of golden light. &apos;It&apos;s a high-intensity landscape,&apos; he said. &apos;We must do it now.&apos; The dolly track was left unfinished. The sound engineer hadn&apos;t yet carted up his heavy equipment. &apos;We will dub it in later,&apos; he said. &apos;These conditions will last for five minutes at most.&apos; &apos;It&apos;s sublime,&apos; Lena said, while taking photographs. &apos;It&apos;s very Caspar Friedrich.&apos; Bale and Zahn walked 50ft down the hill, hiked up again, and said a few lines that Herzog improvised. &apos;I&apos;m going to get you out of here, Duane,&apos; Bale said to Zahn. Then they stared out at the impossibly vast view, and their faces crumpled. &apos;Have the camera plough past them, through the trees, and into the distance,&apos; Herzog told Zeitlinger. At the end of several takes, Herzog cried, &apos;Cut!&apos; He smeared the sweat off his brow with his arm. He grabbed Zeitlinger&apos;s shoulder, and pointed to the dark horizon. &apos;Thank God, I forced it,&apos; he said. &apos;Look. The glowing mountain is gone.&apos; \u00b7 Rescue Dawn is released nationwide on 23 November  Body of work: key moments from the Herzog canon  Even Dwarves Started Small (1970) One of Herzog&apos;s earliest films, it remains his most hardcore, as the inmates of an unspecified institution - a jail or possibly a mental home - start to rebel, causing havoc as their society spirals out of control. Cast with real-life, shrill-voiced dwarves, it&apos;s as absurd and chaotic as it sounds, not to mention extremely hard on the ears.  Nosferatu the Vampire (1978) A milestone in the New German Cinema of the Seventies, this remake of FW Murnau&apos;s silent classic features regular collaborator Klaus Kinski in the lead. Bald, pale, weak and cursed with a lust for blood, Kinski&apos;s vampire is a pathetic but sympathetic figure - a trait common in many of Herzog&apos;s protagonists.  Fitzcarraldo (1982) Herzog&apos;s signature film stars Kinski again as an crazed impresario named Fitzgerald, with a burning desire to build an opera house in the jungles of South America. To do this, he must first carry his 320-tonne steamship up the side of a mountain, an insane feat that Herzog chose to replicate - at great cost to both financiers and bullied crew.  Lessons of Darkness (1992) Herzog&apos;s documentaries, as exemplified by Grizzly Man, are extraordinary, personal affairs, but this 1992 project is perhaps his most powerful. Shot at the tail end of the first Gulf War, with retreating Iraqi soldiers setting fire to the oil fields of Kuwait, it is at once beautiful and harrowing, relying on visuals alone to tell its story.Damon Wise \u00b7 Read part one here", "publicationDate": "2007-11-04T00:03:27Z", "tags": ["Film", "Life and style", "Culture", "Werner Herzog"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/04/1", "title": "Herzog shoots (part two): what happened when the director went to the Thai jungle", "sentences": ["Over the next few days, Marlton and eight crew members were prevented from boarding planes at Bangkok airport.", "Soon afterwards, Knapp was arrested in Bangkok, on the ground that Rescue Dawn had violated work-permit regulations; he spent eight hours in a detention centre, and criminal charges were filed against him."]}, {"article": "Buoyed by the success of the congestion charge in reducing central London&apos;s carbon emissions by an estimated 16%, its mayor, Ken Livingstone, is planning to cut the capital&apos;s production of CO2 to 60% of 1990 levels by 2025. By targeting homes, businesses, transport and energy efficiency, the climate change action plan will prepare the city for a rise in temperatures of between 1.5C and 3C by 2050. Speaking at the Guardian climate change conference earlier this year, Livingstone said: &quot;The prospect of 60% savings in 20 years is easily achievable. Only political will is required.&quot; The London target is far more ambitious than the national targets set by government, which currently aspire to a 60% reduction by 2050. Livingstone believes there are no technical restrictions that will prevent the city becoming carbon-neutral, but he says he will need some key national policy shifts to get beyond the first 10-year milestone in 2016. In that initial period the plan being implemented by the London Climate Change Agency is expected to achieve a 20% drop in CO2 emissions. &quot;It&apos;s remarkable that within the existing powers I have we can achieve a 30% reduction in carbon emissions in 20 years,&quot; he told the conference. &quot;With regulatory change we could make that a 60% reduction within 20 years.&quot; He accused the government of joining in a &quot;carnival of debate&quot; and doing too little. &quot;For all the verbiage there is virtually negligible action.&quot; The London plan is based on the global view of &quot;contraction and convergence&quot;, which recognises that large industrialised nations need to take the lion&apos;s share of responsibility for the warming they have caused while allowing developing nations to increase their emissions until a safe stabilisation level - a &quot;carbon democracy&quot; - has been reached.  Homes contribute 38% of the capital&apos;s 44m tonnes of emissions each year, with about half that coming from heating. A prototype green homes service, based on a successful Canadian scheme, is now being used in 40 homes in Lewisham. The project, organised through a green homes one-stop shop, includes a &quot;concierge&quot; service of advisers who carry out home energy audits and offer advice on energy efficiency, finance, grants, suppliers and installation.  Mark Watts, the mayor&apos;s climate change adviser, says the service will be rolled out in the rest of the capital from next month. Subsidised insulation is part of the programme, and grants of up to \u00a3500 will be available towards the cost of installing renewable sources of micro-generated energy.  The commercial and industrial sectors contribute 40% of London&apos;s emissions, or about 17.6m tonnes a year. The programme sees this being cut by about 7.6m tonnes. A combination of incentives and behavioural change could achieve some of this, while higher standards for new buildings can add a little more. A detailed policy announcement on this part of the plan is expected before Christmas. RetrofittingLondon is also set to begin retrofitting all of its public buildings in the new year to bring them up to desired environmental standards. The city is one of the major partners in a deal set up in association with the Clinton Foundation in May this year, which will retrofit public buildings in the world&apos;s major cities and create a market to encourage business and commerce to join in. The C40 Large Cities Climate summit, held in New York in May, brought together four of the world&apos;s largest energy service companies and five of the largest banks to run the landmark programme, designed to reduce energy consumption in existing buildings. Launching the initiative, former US president Bill Clinton reflected on the difference between many American cities and states and the climate sceptics in Washington when he said, &quot;Climate change is a global problem that requires local action.&quot; Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Siemens and Trane will conduct energy audits in the programme, perform retrofits in 15 pilot cities, and guarantee the energy savings of the projects. The banks that have committed $1bn each to the scheme are ABN Amro, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase and UBS. Loans are repaid from energy savings and are reckoned to be settled at no net cost. In the process, the global market for energy retrofitting in buildings will be doubled. Those cities involved in the first phase are Bangkok, Berlin, Chicago, Houston, Johannesburg, Karachi, London, Melbourne, Mexico City, New York, Rome, Sao Paulo, Seoul, Tokyo and Toronto. Livingstone estimates that the retrofitting of public buildings in those cities alone will reduce global emissions by 10% without the involvement of any government.  The London climate change plan also relies on new, micro-methods of energy generation. Centralised generation is said to waste two thirds of the energy in leakage and distribution, whereas decentralised generation can cut the waste to 15%. The plan envisages moving much of London&apos;s electricity use away from the national grid and on to local, low-carbon sources such as on-site renewable micro-generation, energy from waste, and combined cooling, heat and power systems. The goal is to take a quarter of the city&apos;s supply to local sources by 2025 and have most of it generated in this way by 2050.  High levels of public transport in London mean vehicle emissions are much lower than in other major cities, accounting for 22% of the total. Continued investment in buses, tubes and trains, along with charging for carbon in private cars, can deliver a saving of some 1m tonnes of CO2 a year, says City Hall. However, aviation is not included in the transport figures. Bringing the industry into a carbon trading scheme will be essential to reach the desired 2050 goals, says Livingstone. He points out that only 15% of flights from Heathrow and City airports are business-related. The huge increase in air travel in recent years has been in the leisure sector, and he believes the market should reflect the carbon cost of flights. A \u00a315 carbon tax on each ticket, he says, would halt continuing growth.  If the goal of a 60% reduction in London&apos;s emissions is not achieved by 2050, the mayor envisages a dreadful day when, as in continental Europe in 2003, &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of pensioners could die in summer heatwaves. Even if the goal is achieved, temperatures will be much higher than now, and will be more keenly felt. The city will need shade and a cooling system, and Livingstone is already in talks with the Royal Horticultural Society to devise a planting programme of trees that will survive in the summer heat expected by the middle of the century. Boris Johnson, the Tory candidate in next May&apos;s mayoral election, has yet to decide whether the plan would go ahead if he took over at City Hall. His aides say he is in &quot;policy lockdown mode at the moment,&quot; meeting with experts and testing policy ideas. &quot;Boris wants to be a green mayor and for London to be the greenest city in the world,&quot; says a spokeswoman for the campaign, &quot;and will therefore be looking to see if existing plans are delivering or can be improved upon. It is too early to specifically comment on the Mayor&apos;s climate action plan as it may depend on other policies that Boris will wish to introduce.&quot; What local authorities and and the Merton rule Local authorities are attempting to force house-builders to reduce carbon emissions through the Merton rule - named after the London borough that introduced it in 2003. The rule, which applies to all major developments of 10 dwellings or more, requires 10% of energy used on site to be sourced from renewables. Twenty-two local councils have fully adopted the rule, 65 have included it in their draft local plans and 74 are planning on adopting it or are working out if it&apos;s possible. But despite the wide take up - and a largely positive consultation - it has been scrapped by central government. House-builders had lobbied for a national 10-year target, claiming local targets lead to higher costs. In addition, more than 200 authorities have signed the Nottingham declaration, which pledges them to actively tackle climate change and work with others to reduce emissions. Although signatories are urged to develop a climate action plan, the agreement is only voluntary.  To kick start further work on targets, the Putnam parliamentary joint committee on climate change recommends the measures should be incorporated into the Comprehensive Performance Assessment process - which links local authority performance to funding.

There were 39 of us who strolled through a rainswept Prague, who danced and sang on Budapest&apos;s glorious citadel as the moon hung huge above us, who set up tents by the Turkish coast, and cooked by campfires, who shared Barney&apos;s 24th birthday and cheered as he crooned I Got Friends in Low Places in a voice to rival Garth Brooks; who wandered the streets of Tehran in an array of coloured headscarves when our bus gave up its ghost, even after which we still kept our spirits, and it was 39 who, in new vehicles, sped through the Taliban-ridden Baluchistan desert.  But now the journey has forked into several different paths heading east. Many have flown the bus. Quite literally. It was indeed fitting that our last group activity should have been swooping around Mount Everest.  At 3.30 one morning, the bus was scheduled to leave for Calcutta, but 28 people did not get on board. Three flew from Kathmandu straight to Ko Samui, bypassing Bangkok. Eight dug deep in their pockets to follow their dreams to China, dropped from the original itinerary, and will not rejoin us until Samui. The rest, including me, stayed in Kathmandu for the luxury of outdoor activities, heaven after being cooped up on a bus, with white-water rafting, trekking, bungee jumping or, for the less adventurous, tuk-tuk rides around the beautiful temples.  So here we are in Bangkok, in the jewel-encrusted New World Lodge hotel in the heart of the city, not far from the river, and it&apos;s here that the Kathmandu group reconvene with the Calcutta crew and it does indeed feel like a whole new world. So much to do here: Oz Busers drift up and down the multistorey Mahboonkrong (MBK) shopping complex, stock up on cut-price Rolexes, pretty Billabong dresses and mascara, others catch a movie at the huge cinema. Then there&apos;s the truly &quot;awesome&quot; Royal Palace to wander through, the most beautiful building, gasps one, that they have ever seen. Crossing some of the world&apos;s more perilous regions under military escort made solitary activities nigh on impossible, but the tourist havens we now pass through offer an independence which seems to be an acquired taste among us.

In the latest finding of an Italian judge, she died an agonisingly slow death after having her throat cut as she was sexually assaulted. No one knows who struck the mortal blow, but Ms Kercher&apos;s killing confounds the idea that young British women abroad are most at danger from sweaty loners stalking the badlands of Australia or Thailand. She died in her bedroom in the Umbrian hill city of Perugia, which, until recently, was chiefly noted as a Renaissance and Etruscan treasure trove. Now, if you believe Corriere della Sera, it is Bangkok. Kebab shops and internet cafes have opened to cater for an international clientele with a taste for vodka, drugs and sex. Perugia, in the days since the murder, has become a byword for cultural and moral meltdown. No doubt many young visitors still dutifully study Dante and phone home each week. But murder has revealed another image: of a world in which some cocktail of wealth, restlessness, intoxication and savagery led to a depravity that would appal any underclass predator. Three people are in custody, among them Ms Kercher&apos;s flatmate, Amanda Knox. Police believe she held her friend down as her neck was slashed by a flick knife allegedly owned by Raffaele Sollecito, Ms Knox&apos;s boyfriend. The third suspect is Diya Lumumba, a Congolese bar owner. There are many alarming aspects of a blameless young woman&apos;s murder. Among them is the detail in the public domain before a charge has been brought, a motive offered or hard evidence supplied. The judge has spoken of &apos;grave indications of guilt&apos; and the short circuitry of due process is unlikely to trouble those who have already forged the case for the prosecution. Even before the latest allegations emerged, &apos;Foxy Knoxy&apos;, who posed with a machine gun on MySpace, had been found guilty in the court of social networking. Her boyfriend, pictured on the internet as a mad doctor wielding a meat cleaver, was similarly damned. Images that appeared to show warped hedonists at play have fed public fear that some new class of monster is emerging: rootless, devoid of conscience and modelled on a darker variant of Patricia Highsmith&apos;s Ripley. But the killing also evokes more arcane predators. Some accounts suggest Hindley and Brady, reworked for cyberspace. Others hint at Macbeth for YouTubers. Knox&apos;s internet entries vied last week for the new media horror awards with the YouTube posting by Pekka-Eric Auvinen, the 18-year-old Finn who filmed himself, gun in hand, before killing seven fellow pupils, his school&apos;s headmistress and himself. He is the latest psychopathic narcissist to advertise impending slaughter. The phenomenon of disaffected young men who turn to murder, and the copycat nature of the Finnish massacre, makes this crime part of a chilling pattern. Yet Auvinen seems to have inspired less public revulsion in the UK than Knox. There is little equivalence between a declared killer pledged to &apos;eliminate all I see unfit&apos; and a girl whose internet ramblings could, in normal circumstances, indicate just another spoiled attention-seeker. Her familiarity, though, is what makes Knox so frightening to many. Her backstory, unlike Auvinen&apos;s, meshes with parents&apos; fears. Thousands of girls flaunt, as she did, their bodies or their secrets on MySpace. In adult anxiety, they would have been easy meat for the 29,000 sex offenders recently debarred from prowling the site. They are also, supposedly, part of an over-sexualised generation who dabble in virtual friendships and live dangerous second lives until the real world swallows them up. Perugia is becoming a morality tale about a generation for whom easy sex and easyJet have supposedly created a world without boundaries. But Knox&apos;s history does not support the idea that girls should be protected more closely and brought up more strictly. Taught by Jesuits and forbidden, as an American, to buy alcohol before she was 21, Knox appears to have been too naive and cosseted to avoid sex, drink and nemesis. Ms Kercher, by contrast, was an emissary for young British women. The Erasmus scheme, on which she was enrolled, is the EU&apos;s &apos;flagship&apos; education exchange programme. The relatively few UK applicants, compared with the rest of Europe, suggest that British students should widen their horizons, not narrow them. Obviously, travel carries risks. Of the 200,000 who set out on gap years, a quarter report a &apos;bad experience&apos;, according to government research. Among the malaria and stolen laptops, there are occasional tragedies. Earlier this year, Lindsay Ann Hawker, also educated at Leeds, was found buried in a bath outside a Tokyo apartment. Such horrors underline the idea that clever, trusting, confident young women who treat the world like a global campus are courting extreme danger. In reality, young people who never stray from British backwaters are just as likely, or unlikely, to meet some terrible fate. The killing of Ms Kercher does, though, illustrate one new threat. Privacy has been abolished, now that any bit of flesh or drunken foolery displayed on the internet is preserved for all time. Of 600 British companies surveyed recently, a fifth said they logged on to networking sites, such as Facebook, to vet applicants. In a world of universal celebrity, there is no right to silence. What Knox and her friends did or did not do to Meredith Kercher is for the courts to decide. In the absence of any proof, a new fear has taken root. While the massacre in a Finnish school reflects a terrifying, but familiar, alienation in young men, the events in Perugia flout received wisdom. They suggest that the most pampered, spoiled, cherished and protected young people may also have the greatest capacity to become involved in unspeakable acts. If there is any easy story to be told, it is that the ogres of modern life - the internet, celebrities, materialism, cheap travel - are not the perils they are made out to be, as long as children learn early to be responsible. We are not seeing the emergence of an amoral generation, in thrall to sensationalism. Nor does the ability to see so much, both on internet sites, and in the flood of detail emerging from Perugia, imply that one crime, or one deviant group, denotes the death of conscience or the crumbling of values. Though young people live more exposed existences than any previous generation, the template for student life is still the vigil at Leeds University at which friends dropped flowers and lit candles to the memory of Meredith Kercher. As for parents appalled by the warped novelties of a modern murder, there are only the oldest lessons of trust and faith. You try to equip your children to face the worst dangers of the world and hope they never meet them. mary.riddell@observer.co.uk", "publicationDate": "2007-11-11T00:17:32Z", "tags": [], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/11/comment.comment", "title": "Mary Riddell: The narcissism that terrifies parents", "sentences": ["Now, if you believe Corriere della Sera, it is Bangkok."]}, {"article": "The following correction was printed in the Observer&apos;s For the record column, Sunday November 18 2007  In the article below we quoted Stephen Jakobi as a spokesman for Fair Trials Abroad, but he retired as director in June last year. While he remains founder patron of the organisation (now known as Fair Trials International), he is not its spokesman.    The condoms are smeared in margarine or local vegetable oil, &apos;to help them slip down&apos;, says Kawko, holding out the white grains of pure cocaine in his scarred palm. Behind him, on the palm-tree fringed beach of Prampram village, dozens of colourfully painted longboats make land; the bulky wooden vessels heaved and roped out of the roaring West Atlantic by slender teenage boys. &apos;There are many other couriers here in Ghana; some have made a dozen journeys to London and Amsterdam. You can see the benefit it has brought to their families, even here in our village. Their mothers have stopped working; some have motorbikes and have bought fishing boats. Some have also died. A schoolfriend of mine swallowed over 50 condoms and died within an hour. He dipped the condoms in honey and they ruptured. He was foolish; the condoms were local, not imported.&apos; Kawko gestures to where his youngest son is playing in the sea with a yellow plastic oil drum. &apos;I wouldn&apos;t want this life for him.&apos; Over the past few years a concerted shift in trafficking routes has transformed West African countries like Ghana, Senegal and Guinea Bissau into volatile hubs for cocaine smuggled from South America to a booming European market. Using sophisticated transportation networks and the latest communication technology to elude woefully inept coastguards, Colombian traffickers are establishing transit areas along the Gulf of Guinea that can only worsen lawlessness in countries already overwhelmed by crime, poverty and instability. For locals the route opens up a risky but tempting way out of poverty. A single flight to Amsterdam from Ghana, via Morocco, earlier this year carried 32 West Africans, all of whom had swallowed cocaine packets or concealed them in their luggage. Impatient with the increasing arrest rates of mules, the South American cartels have recruited London-based Nigerians and Ghanaians to scour Britain&apos;s capital for gullible teenage drug couriers. Last week two teenagers were seized at Accra airport, en route for London Gatwick. The 16- and 19-year-olds, both Lithuanian boys living in south London, were arrested under the British-led Operation Westbridge, a joint project by HM Revenue &amp; Customs iand the Ghanaian authorities to catch drug smugglers using Accra as a gateway to the UK. The pair were allegedly caught with nearly four kilos of cocaine ingested in around 16 condoms. It came after July&apos;s seizure of 16-year-old London schoolgirls Yasemin Vatansever and Yutunde Diya, who were stopped leaving the country allegedly carrying \u00a3300,000 of cocaine hidden in laptop bags. A narcotics officer who interrogated the girls claimed the teenagers knew exactly what they were coming to do in Ghana. They were, he claimed, &apos;classic mules&apos; recruited in London to come to Ghana and pick up the bags for a fee of \u00a33,000. Up to 60 mules a week are estimated to arrive in Britain from the region. The rain falls heavily on the bumpy road to Kumasi, churning it to red slushy mud. Here, 50km from the Ghanaian capital, Accra, is Nswana Prison. For its two recent occupants, Vatansever and Diya, the international fight against South American drug cartels is of little concern. The girls, who had told their parents they were going on a school trip to France before flying to Ghana, fit the classic drug mule profile - young, poor and gullible. They have spent most of their time in isolation. In the past fortnight Vatansever is believed to have contracted malaria. Conditions inside the high-walled compound are grim. Each day the inmates are employed in hard labour, building an irrigation plant. The cramped cells often fit as many as a dozen prisoners, who share toilet facilities. Disease and violence are rampant. For the past few days, officials have been temporarily holding the teenagers at Ghana&apos;s Narcotics Control Board, on the top floor of the innocuous office block. After reaching the floor where the girls were held, The Observer was turned back by a machine-gun toting guard. The girls, he said, were well. We heard them shouting from their makeshift cells. The trial of the British schoolgirls will resume in Ghana this week and both are expected to be sentenced to up to five years in prison. They are being tried under Ghana&apos;s Juvenile Justice Act, meaning that their trial must be completed within six months and they can only be held on remand for three months. The girls &apos;vigorously deny&apos; the charges, according to Fair Trials Abroad, which helped to find lawyers for the pair and has been liaising with the families and the Foreign Office. Fair Trials Abroad lawyer Stephen Jakobi, says the case bears striking similarities to that of two Birmingham teenagers who were jailed in Thailand after being found with \u00a34m worth of heroin. Karyn Smith, 18, and 17-year-old Patricia Cahill spent three years in the infamous &apos;Bangkok Hilton&apos; prison before being pardoned in 1993. They claimed they were forced to confess by Thai police, who planted drugs on them to claim reward money. Jakobi said: &apos;You&apos;ve got two very young girls going through an airport where they were bound to get caught. There are lots of parallels, and it seems to me extremely probable that these girls were being used as decoys. As there were British officers involved in their arrest it would have made sense to allow them through to Britain and arrest them there, not leave them in Ghana.&apos; Almost all of the Ghana-based mules used by drugs gangs are poor and willing to risk not only their liberty but their lives for less than \u00a3500. The mules are all paid an initial fee, sometimes as low as \u00a350, with the rest payable upon a successful handover. If they are arrested, they will not get paid and the debts they left behind will be passed on to family members. According to Tony Walker, Revenue &amp; Customs head of operations, the region is of increasing concern to the British authorities. &apos;The air courier route from West Africa, either directly to the UK or in transit through other EU airports, is a specific threat,&apos; he said. &apos;The use of such young people in smuggling drugs demonstrates the ruthless nature of those criminal gangs involved in the illegal narcotics trade and the misery they cause.&apos; As well as providing a number of British undercover operatives on the ground Operation Westbridge has supplied technical and operational expertise to the Ghanaians. Since November 2006, Westbridge has made 122 interceptions, seizing 356kg of cocaine, 2,275kg of cannabis and 1.3kg of heroin. It follows the success of Operation Airbridge, a joint UK-Jamaican initiative to catch drugs couriers with internal concealments before they board planes from Jamaica. But there are fears that without the full-time aid of a British task force, local authorities will be unable to cope: &apos;The British have only left a small team behind,&apos; one Ghanaian Customs Office said: &apos;We have some equipment on loan but our surveillance experience is minimal. We don&apos;t have sniffer dogs, we don&apos;t have enough scanners; it is all about profiling and gathering intelligence and we need the British to attain that, not just temporary assistance.&apos;.&apos; Harvested in the foothills of the Andes in Colombia, Peru or Ecuador by cartels, the leaves of the coca plant are processed in laboratories using kerosene, methyl alcohol and sulphuric acid. The resulting powder is dried, cut into blocks and transferred to ports in Colombia and Venezuela, routinely these days, for shipment to West Africa. The cocaine is then cut into smaller amounts and sent on to Europe. The US is the world&apos;s top market for cocaine, but use there is declining. In Europe, demand is rising. A kilo of cocaine brings about \u00a325,000 in Europe, compared with about half that in the US. London has become the centre of Europe&apos;s market. Not surprisingly the smuggling routes are as complex as they are diverse. In April this year eight European nations, led by Britain, launched a military-law enforcement task force targeting cocaine traffic from Africa. The Maritime Analysis Operations Centre, based in Lisbon, teams police, navy and customs resources from across Europe, a model similar to Florida&apos;s Drug Enforcement Agency. Because of historic ties to Latin America, the Iberian Peninsula remains a key gateway, with around 30 per cent of Britain&apos;s cocaine coming in through Spanish corridors. The drugs are stockpiled in West Africa and then moved to clandestine landing zones on the coasts of Spain and Portugal, or commercial ports such as Barcelona and Antwerp before reaching London in fishing vessels and commercial ship containers. In September, the US DEA tipped off the Spanish coastguard to a ship from Venezuela hauling 15 tonnes of cocaine. The ship off-loaded four tonnes to a smaller vessel in the Atlantic. Spanish authorities intercepted the smaller load near Ibiza, where the cocaine had been transferred to fast boats operated by Bulgarians and Croatians. The Spaniards then caught up with the mother ship heading for Ghana. Of particular concern to the DEA are Ghana and Guinea-Bissau. In Ghana, top officials were accused last year of protecting a Venezuelan drug lord. Ghanaian police recorded the continent&apos;s biggest cocaine bust last year, arresting Ghanaian and Nigerian suspects in a Mercedes van containing two tons of the drug concealed in boxes of fish. Fronted by Colombian cartels, local gangsters in the region have even set up elaborate front companies which allegedly buy high-level protection for the business interests of their new South American partners. Most aren&apos;t difficult to spot. In Accra, Ghana&apos;s capital, BMWs, Mercedes and newly imported canary yellow Humvees stand out from the beaten and battered local taxis. As an example of how high up the lure of drugs money reaches you only need look at the recent case of the Ghanaian MP Eric Amoateng. While serving in parliament, Amoateng sent 70kg of heroin, hidden in boxes of pottery, to the US and was arrested in January 2006 when he arrived at New York&apos;s JFK airport to collect it. Narcotics seizures in West Africa jumped eightfold in 2006, according to the latest Europol statistics. But it said in a report last year that &apos;only a very small proportion of the cocaine passing through the continent is actually being seized&apos;. Experts worry that traffickers could eventually smuggle in precursor chemicals and set up labs, enabling them to ship coca base across the Atlantic instead of the more expensive finished product. At a recent major seminar on narcotics, attended by some of the world&apos;s leading law enforcement experts, the connection between West Africa and the scourge of drugs in Europe was spelled out. One of the speakers, Karen Tandy, head of the DEA, said: &apos;Latin American gangs are setting up shop in Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea-Bissau in the West and Kenya in the East. Africa has emerged as a real hotspot in just the past couple of years. Africa will become, in terms of a drugs hot-bed, one of our worst nightmares if we do not get ahead of that curve now.&apos;", "publicationDate": "2007-11-11T18:44:48Z", "tags": ["World news", "Society", "Drugs trade", "Drugs", "Ghana", "Organised crime", "Law", "Africa"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/11/drugsandalcohol.internationalcrime", "title": "Ghana to UK: the new trail of misery", "sentences": ["Karyn Smith, 18, and 17-year-old Patricia Cahill spent three years in the infamous &apos;Bangkok Hilton&apos; prison before being pardoned in 1993."]}, {"article": "On the morning of April Fools&apos; Day 2005, I woke up in a sexual addiction treatment centre in a suburb of Philadelphia. As I limped out of the drab dog&apos;s bed in which I was expected to sleep for the next 30 wankless nights, I observed the previous incumbent had left a thread of dental floss by the pillow - most likely as a noose for his poor, famished dinkle. When I&apos;d arrived the day before, the counsellors had taken away my copy of the Guardian, as there was a depiction of the Venus de Milo in the arts section, but let me keep the Sun, which obviously had a page 3 lovely. What kind of pervert police force censors a truncated sculpture but lets Keeley Hazell pass without question? &quot;Blimey, this devious swine&apos;s got a picture of a concrete bird with no arms - hanging&apos;s too good for him!&quot; If they were to censor London town, they would ignore Soho but think that the statue of Alison Lapper in Trafalgar Square had been commissioned by Caligula. Being all holed up in the aptly named KeyStone clinic (while the facility did not have its own uniformed police force, the suggestion of bungling silent film cops is appropriate) was an all too familiar drag. Not that I&apos;d ever been incarcerated in sex chokey before, Lord no, but it was the umpteenth time that I&apos;d been confronted with the galling reality that there are things over which I have no control and people who can force their will upon you. Teachers, sex police, actual police, drug counsellors: people who can make you sit in a drugless, sexless cell either real or metaphorical and ponder the actuality of life&apos;s solitary essence. In the end it&apos;s just you. Alone. The necessity for harsh self-assessment wasn&apos;t the only thing I hated about that KeyStone place. No, that vied for supremacy with multitudinous bastard truths. I hated my bed: the mattress was sponge, and you had to stretch your own sheet over this miserable little single divan in the corner of the room. And I hated the room itself where the strangled urges of onanism clung to the walls like mildew. I particularly hated the American grey squirrels that were running around outside - just free, like idiots, giggling and touching each other in the early spring sunshine. The triumph of these little divs over our noble red British squirrel had become a searing metaphor for my own subjugation at the hands of the anti-fuck Yanks. To make my surrender to conformity more official, I had been obliged to sign a contract promising that I would refrain from masturbation, porn, &quot;seductive behaviour&quot; and &quot;sexual contact with another person&quot;. I should have been photographed signing it, like when a footballer joins a new team. Sex is recreational for me, as well as a way of accruing status and validation (even before I attained the unique accolade of &quot;Shagger of the Year&quot; from the Sun. We all need something to help us unwind at the end of the day. You might have a glass of wine, or a joint, or a big delicious blob of heroin to silence your silly brainbox of its witterings, but there has to be some form of punctuation, or life just seems utterly relentless. And this is what sex provides for me - a breathing space, when you&apos;re outside of yourself and your own head. Especially in the actual moment of climax, where you literally go, &quot;Ah, there&apos;s that, then. I&apos;ve unwound. I&apos;ve let go.&quot; Not without good reason do the French describe an orgasm as a &quot;little death&quot;. That&apos;s exactly what it is for me (in a good way, obviously) - a little moment away, a holiday from my head. So why would a fella who plainly enjoys how&apos;s yer father as much as I do go to a so-called &quot;sex camp&quot;? Many people are sceptical about the idea of what I like to call &quot;sexy addiction&quot;, thinking it a spurious notion, invented primarily to help Hollywood film stars evade responsibility for their priapic excesses. But I reckon there is such a thing. Addiction, by definition, is a compulsive behaviour that you cannot control or relinquish, in spite of its destructive consequences. And if my life proves nothing else, it demonstrates that this formula can be applied to sex just as easily as it can be to drugs or alcohol, both of which I know more than a bit about. At one point, about five years ago, I had a harem of about 10 women, whom I would rotate in addition to one-night stands and random casual encounters. But shagging - incessant as it was - no longer seemed to have the required calming effect. I was on the brink of becoming sufficiently well known for my carnal overindulgences - with lapdancers and prostitutes, to say nothing of all the women who didn&apos;t sell sex for a living - to cause me professional difficulties. There&apos;s nothing especially peculiar or odd about my erotic predilections. It&apos;s the scale of my sexual endeavours that causes the problems, not the nature of them. I just like girls, all different ones, in an unsophisticated, unevolved way, like a Sun reader or a yobbo at a bus stop in Basildon, perhaps because, at my core, that&apos;s what I am. I&apos;m a bloke from Grays with a good job and a terrific haircut who&apos;s been given a Wonka ticket to a lovely sex factory &apos;cos of the ol&apos; fame, and while Augustus Gloop drowns and Veruca Salt goes blue, I&apos;m cleaning up, I&apos;m rinsin&apos; it baby! I haven&apos;t always treated women well - more than one relationship has collapsed because of my infidelity - but to this day I feel a fierce warmth for women who have the same disregard for the social conventions of sexual protocol as I do. I love it when I meet a woman and her sexuality is dancing across her face, so it&apos;s apparent that all we need to do is nod and find a cupboard. My manager, John Noel - think of a big, kind, lovely, vicious bastard, like a Darth Vader from Manchester running a school for disadvantaged children - who had previously successfully forced me into drug rehabilitation, thought a little stretch in winky-nick would do me the power of good, and used threats, bullying, love and blackmail to make me go. I eventually agreed for the same reason that I had given up drink and drugs - because my ambition is the most powerful force within me. While some celebrities have &quot;yes men&quot; surrounding them, I have &quot;fuck-off&quot; men. And so John spitefully decided not to send me to some sort of celebrity treatment centre, like the world-renowned Meadows Clinic in Arizona, but a facility where not all the places were private, where a certain proportion of people were there on judicial programmes - &quot;jail-swerves&quot;, they call them, when you&apos;re a drug addict and you&apos;re offered a choice of prison or rehab. The same option exists for the terminally saucy - get treatment or go to prison; in prison there&apos;ll be much more sex but it could err on the side of coercive. I had no idea of what to expect when I arrived at KeyStone, although I&apos;d spoken to one of the counsellors several times on the phone - the reassuringly named Travis Flowers. I told Travis about the lack of control I was exercising over who I was having sex with. I was pursuing hanky-panky like it was a job, like there was a league table that I had to be at the summit of. And as I explained how I toiled each day with the diligence of Bobby Moore and the grit of Julian Dicks, humming slave songs to keep my spirits up, Travis reassured me that I was just the sort of person who needed KeyStone&apos;s help. The clinic was in the middle of this square in some quiet Philadelphia suburb. The house looked like a normal American family home does - you know, where they&apos;ve got the sloping roof to the porch bit and gardens around it, a bit like where the Waltons lived, all pastoral and sweet, but with John-Boy chained up in the mop cupboard scrabbling around trying to fiddle with his goolies through a mask of tears. Over the road there was a church: a modern grey building, which constantly played a recording of church bells. Strange it was. Why no proper bells? I never went in but I bet it was a robot church for androids, where the Bible was in binary and their Jesus had laser eyes and metal claws. I was greeted on the steps of the clinic by one of the counsellors. I can&apos;t remember her name, but she was wearing a T-shirt with frogs on. It turned out she was obsessed with &apos;em, and when I asked her why she said, &quot;When I was a kid, there was a pond near my house which all the frogs would try to get back to, and they&apos;d get killed crossing over the road, so I used to try and help them across.&quot; &quot;Fucking hell,&quot; I thought. &quot;D&apos;ya wanna have a clearer analogy etched on your T-shirt? How troublingly apposite that your mission in life should now be to save people from destruction as they pursue their natural instinct to spawn.&quot; At this point, the frog-lady introduced me to a subdued and pinch-faced individual. &quot;Arthur will show you around,&quot; she said cheerfully. &quot;He&apos;s gonna be your roommate.&quot; (In the film, Arthur would be played by Rick Moranis or William H Macy.) Arthur showed me round the kitchen with its horrible meaty American meals. Meals which I, as a vegetarian, couldn&apos;t eat, so I would have to live on fruit for the month, like a little ape. One by one, I began to meet more of my fellow clients, or patients, or inmates, or perverts - whatever you want to call them, including an intimidating Puerto Rican cove who looked like a hybrid of Colin Farrell&apos;s &quot;Bullseye&quot; character from the film Daredevil and Bill Sykes&apos;s dog in Oliver Twist (whose name was also Bullseye, strangely enough), who kept calling me &quot;London&quot; - &quot;Hey, London!&quot; I resented being called &quot;London&quot;. There are eight million people living in London, and my identity, I hope, is quite specific. He addressed me the same way he would&apos;ve Ken Livingstone or Danny Baker - God knows what they&apos;d be doing there. I&apos;m not even from London; I&apos;m from Essex. (Though I suppose &quot;Essex&quot; would have been even less appropriate - it has, after all, got the three letters &quot;s-e-x&quot; in it and that&apos;s what caused all this bother.) This demeaning and geographically inaccurate mode of address was just one aspect of what soon began to seem like a concerted campaign to dismantle every element of my persona. It was not just my copy of the Guardian that had been confiscated on my arrival, but also my Richard Pryor CDs and my William Burroughs novel. And I&apos;d not been at KeyStone long before my attire began to attract complaints. Apparently, the way my excess belt hung in front of my crotch was confusing and enticing to the pervert fraternity as it suggested a phallus. So they censored me. I was like Elvis &quot;the Pelvis&quot; Presley on Ed Sullivan, I tells ya, punished for the crime of being sexy. As the days went on, I started to learn why other people were in there. I found out that Arthur was a paedophile who had eloped with his 13-year-old foster daughter. If he went back to Arizona to face the charges, he&apos;d be in line for either lifetime imprisonment or execution. Peter, a well groomed, silver-bearded Christopher Lee figure, had had sex with his wife&apos;s sister when she was 12. These revelations came as a bit of a blow and made me question the rationale of the whole dashed trip. &quot;OK,&quot; I thought, &quot;I&apos;ve a bit of an eye for the ladies, now as a kind of punishment I&apos;m rooming with a paedophile. Is that gonna be helpful?&quot; Like them lads that get sent down for nicking a car radio and end up sharing a cell with a diligent bank robber mentor who schools them in criminality. I went down to the office and started making frantic phone-calls home, saying, &quot;Get me out of this place.&quot; If I&apos;d been less terrified I might&apos;ve paused to dream up a new reality show format, I&apos;m a Celebrity, Get Me Out of This Demented Sex Centre&quot;, where minor faces off the box are forced to doss down with, say, Peter Sutcliffe for the amusement of an apathetic nation. John was on holiday, and no one I spoke to was prepared to sanction my departure so, out of fear, desperation and a kind of morbid curiosity, I decided to stay. It&apos;s extraordinary how quickly you get institutionalised in that kind of environment. You start wearing, not pyjamas exactly, as you do get dressed, but certainly indoorsy sorts of clothes. They have meetings every morning and afternoon. The rituals are astonishing. You have to go round the room introducing yourself - &quot;Hello, I&apos;m Russell&quot; - and then admitting to your recent transgressions. These aren&apos;t really wrongdoings as we would normally understand them, more everyday actions that have developed a sexual component: &quot;I had an erotic thought&quot;; &quot;I experienced eroticised rage&quot;; or &quot;I did some eroticised humour&quot;. Then you&apos;d round the whole thing off by saying, &quot;My goal for today is to get through the KeyStone experience and just live it as best I can.&quot; People began to customise this closing declaration, I suppose as a way of emphasising their own particular characters. But far from lessening the institutional feel of the whole proceedings, it kind of exacerbated it. Soon enough, each person seemed to have their own slogan: &quot;Hello, I&apos;m Stuart, and I&apos;m gonna swim like a KeyStone dolphin.&quot; These customised slogans would often be drawn from the totemic cuddly toy that we were each obliged to select from the mantelpiece. I had a camel. Or someone else would say, &quot;I&apos;m gonna ride the KeyStone Express,&quot; and all the others would make supportive train-noises - &quot;Wooh! Wooh!&quot; And I&apos;d be sat there in the middle thinking, &quot;Oh great, I&apos;m in a nuthouse.&quot; In that situation, however, alienated from my normal surroundings, I realised that the outer surface of what I thought was my unique, individual identity was just a set of routines. We all have an essential self, but if you spend every day chopping up meat on a slab, and selling it by the pound, soon you&apos;ll find you&apos;ve become a butcher. And if you don&apos;t want to become a butcher (and why would you?), you&apos;re going to have to cut right through to the bare bones of your own character in the hope of finding out who you really are. Which bloody hurts. Perhaps you&apos;re wondering what formulated my peculiar sexuality? It ain&apos;t that peculiar. I&apos;m a bloke from Essex who likes birds with big bottoms and big boobs, lovely dolly birds. I don&apos;t mean to be dismissive - they might be incredibly dark, fretful Sylvia Plath-style heroines for all I know - but if they are, I&apos;d rather not find out because life&apos;s difficult enough. The episode that defined my relations with women - and with myself - occurred in Hong Kong with my dad. I was 17. His third marriage had just broken up, so he needed someone to go on holiday with. I was unemployed, penniless, birdless and desperate for his approval; we were the perfect holiday companions. On the plane home he said, &quot;I went away with a boy and came back with a man.&quot; Both of those people were me, so what happened to induce such a significant transition? In addition to Hong Kong we visited Bali, Singapore and Thailand, and in all those places we saw incredible things. There was only one sight I was interested in seeing. Or rather one thing I was inerested in doing, repeatedly. One thing that chewed its way into my barren little soul and gave me, at long last, a physical pursuit that I was good at. Sex. Disposable sex, sex as leisure, sex for pleasure, sex you sordid little treasure, drag me from monotony and give me kicks too hot to measure. On day one in Hong Kong we went to some sleazy dive hidden behind a thick black drape where women from the east traipsed louchely along the mirrored promenade in garish beachwear. That promenade was a conveyor belt from which produce could be selected; I didn&apos;t know that then but my cock did, twitching, preparing frantically, trying to recall correct procedure. &quot;This is not a drill, repeat, this is not a drill.&quot; My dad sat there next to me, familiar with this glistening and foreign terrain. I didn&apos;t understand what I was witnessing, but by jingo, I knew I liked it. Dumbstruck, I sat looking at the women, their hair, each strand identifiable as it responded to a fan that had been placed there to elicit exactly the reaction I felt in my pantaloons, their toenails, painted and perfect, each solitary toe a match for me. They didn&apos;t seem enslaved or exploited - to me they weren&apos;t; they were mistresses, goddesses, salvation. &quot;I can&apos;t wait to tell my mates that I saw these women in swimsuits,&quot; I said to myself. Before long, I was sat on a barstool with a Filipino girl called Mary-Lou, or something similarly unlikely. I thought, &quot;I can&apos;t wait to tell my mates I was sat talking to Mary-Lou.&quot; That quickly became, &quot;I can&apos;t wait to tell my mates I was kissing her.&quot; Then we were leaving, a street, a cab, perfume, hairspray, the three Asian prostitutes that my dad was drunkenly herding - Mary-Lou, another girl and the madam of the club, who had come along just for sport (when I learned that she&apos;d come along without payment, I thought that a testimony to my dad&apos;s powers). Back at our hotel room, my dad set about unwrapping his two prostitutes, like pass-the-parcel where the music never stopped, and I sat nervously on the edge of the other twin bed with Mary-Lou, kissing her and thinking she was beautiful and falling in love. I&apos;d only had anything close to sex once before - a week before my 16th birthday. I&apos;d been careful to cultivate an image of myself as an aristocratic sex-pert, but she must have known I was a virgin as soon as the bungling encounter commenced. In Hong Kong, I was naked and shy about my body. I had trouble getting hard, and the blow job seemed daft, not sexual, just giggly and intrusive. After the un-sex, I carried Mary-Lou in my weedy arms out on to the balcony to look at the view of a great, looming skyscraper, disapprovingly observing. Mary-Lou didn&apos;t make me feel embarrassed, and was incredibly romantic really, given the context. I stroked Mary-Lou&apos;s hair and kissed her cheek and traced my finger down her perfect nose, scored by the cacophony from the adjacent bedlam, &quot;Yeah, come on!&quot; and &quot;Phwooar, you&apos;re juicy!&quot; As she was about to go, she said expertly, &quot;Russell, I must leave now before I fall in love with you.&quot; My heart skipped, and I heard, &quot;Oh, fucking hell, I&apos;m gonna be sick&quot; - a disapproving announcement from dear old Ron. The next morning, my dad, concealed behind a newspaper, folded down the top right-hand corner. &quot;Did you wear a condom with that bird last night?&quot; &quot;Oh, no I didn&apos;t, Dad.&quot; He sniffed, &quot;You should&apos;ve.&quot; Then the corner of the page flicked up once again, and he was gone. In the course of the rest of that holiday, I had sex with loads more prostitutes; always got a hard on, never wore a condom, and never fell in love. In Bangkok, when bar girls in Patpong left their posts to follow me down the street, cooing and touching my hair, I felt that I had my dad&apos;s unequivocal approval. When I came back from Asia, I was much more comfortable around women, and my sexuality had morphed forever from bewildered innocence into something more complex and rapacious. Once my career as a comedian and TV presenter started to pick up, I began to have loads of encounters after gigs. As my sexual appetite grew, I found myself engaged in an increasingly desperate quest to satisfy it. I became so open to suggestion that when someone asked me if I&apos;d like to go to an orgy, I didn&apos;t think twice before accepting this invitation. The word &quot;orgy&quot; is undeniably an evocative one. It conjures up sumptuous images of delicate muslin drapes being teased by a breeze, Turkish music playing everywhere (in fact my whole orgy scenario seems to have been lifted pretty much wholesale from a Turkish Delight advert), nubile Nubian women entwined about each other like a Henry Moore statue, people decadently devouring grapes. I thought there&apos;d probably be a sort of Swiss bloke with no irises or pupils in his eyes as well, just kind of staring. But what I got in a tower block in Hackney was people who looked like they were made out of Ready Brek, swathed in clingfilm, waddling back and forth with towels about their waists. And everywhere there was this intangible sadness, as if the orgy was being directed by Mike Leigh. I remember this woman came bustling out of a doorway when I first got there - she reminded me of my mum, which didn&apos;t help - and said, &quot;Just done my second . . . better go and rinse my mouth out.&quot; Then a washing-machine repair man turned up - not as a guest, but to repair the washing-machine. It was to rescue me from these kinds of grisly scenarios that John Noel sent me to KeyStone. And I&apos;m glad he did. One day I had to write a victims&apos; list - a litany of the women I&apos;d wronged as a result of my sexual addiction.

He was China&apos;s most trusted contact among the inner circle of the genocidal regime that ruled Cambodia from 1975-79. But at 5.30am on Monday November 12, international law and justice finally caught up with him at his luxury mansion in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh. Cambodian police, acting on an arrest warrant from the jointly run Cambodian-UN Khmer Rouge tribunal (officially known by the acronym ECCC), arrested the 77-year-old Ieng Sary and his wife Ieng Thirith, the former minister for education in a regime that abolished schooling as well as money. Asia&apos;s first genocide tribunal, that has frequently been bogged down by legal disputes and budgetary problems, is now close to finalising indictments against the five surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge regime, with four now in custody and one more expected to be arrested in the next few weeks. According to a July 18 filing by prosecutors to the tribunal&apos;s judges, Ieng Sary, &quot;promoted, instigated, facilitated, encouraged and/or condoned the perpetration of the crimes&quot; when the Khmer Rouge held power. It said there was evidence of Ieng Sary&apos;s participation in planning, directing and co-ordinating the Khmer Rouge &quot;policies of forcible transfer, forced labour and unlawful killings&quot;. However, the accused has denied all responsibility for the estimated 1.7 million deaths under the Khmer Rouge and claims that as a foreign minister he was not fully in the loop. In fact documents show that he ranked third in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy from 1975-77, with Nuon Chea, who has already been detained, ranking second. His arrest is of great importance to the credibility of the Khmer Rouge tribunal. Many Cambodians and feared and international commentators predicted that Ieng Sary would be the one leader who would never be brought to justice, for a variety of reasons. First, he is the only one who had previously been indicted for genocide, together with Pol Pot, immediately after the Vietnamese army toppled the Khmer Rouge regime in 1979. leng Sary and Pol Pot were indicted for genocide by the Vietnamese-backed &quot;People&apos;s tribunal&quot;, tried in absentia and sentenced to death. The verdicts of the 1979 Phnom Penh tribunal were written off by western governments as &quot;communist propaganda&quot; to provide legitimacy for the newly established anti-Pol Pot government known as the Heng Samrin regime, backed by the former Soviet Union. Pol Pot died in 1998. In 1996, leng Sary led a breakaway Khmer Rouge faction that greatly contributed to the eventual defeat of the insurgency. The Cambodian government pushed through an amnesty resolution as a reward, backed by parliament. That led to the king signing a pardon that lifted the death sentence and released leng Sary from the verdicts handed down by the 1979 tribunal. In addition, he was gifted with a diplomatic passport, without holding any official position. In spite of his endorsement of the &quot;killing fields&quot; regime, leng Sary has enjoyed a very long and lavish immunity from prosecution. He enjoyed VIP status as Pol Pot&apos;s foreign minister at the UN during the 1980s. Washington&apos;s powerful lobby in the UN and arm-twisting of their client states worked a diplomatic miracle by extending UN recognition to a government that no longer existed, after being booted out of power in 1979. His other great supporter has been China, who provided almost unlimited arms, bullets and tanks to the regime both when it was in power and long afterwards, as the Khmer Rouge continued for another 20 years to try and shoot their way back into power. Cambodian human rights groups, knowing China feared embarrassing disclosures about their complicity with a murderous regime, feared Beijing would block a trial ever taking place. If the tribunal did go ahead, they were convinced that China would certainly protect leng Sary from prosecution. During the 1980s, Ieng Sary was the favoured conduit for Chinese funds and he collected at least a million dollars a year from Beijing&apos;s embassy in Bangkok from 1979-1990. He also travelled on a Chinese passport. Prime minister Hun Sen, probably at the behest of China, made several public comments that Ieng Sary should not be prosecuted at a time when aid from Beijing was rapidly increasing in the late 1990s. Not surprising then, that so many believed that Ieng Sary could never be prosecuted, and it could all be justified with the convenient legal argument that no man can be tried twice. But in an interview with the Phnom Penh Post in 1996, Hun Sen, an astute politician, explained that he had ensured the amnesty for Ieng Sary was carefully drafted - &quot;the amnesty only covered his previous conviction. It did not give him immunity from prosecution at a future trial for his role in the genocide.&quot; Given the importance of Ieng Sary, his detention can be counted as a diplomatic as well as a legal triumph for the ECCC. The fourth suspect to be detained, Ieng Thirith, was the sister-in-law of the late Pol Pot: her sister, Khieu Ponnary, was his first wife. The remaining suspect to be arrested is Khieu Samphan. Now the stage is more or less set for the trial to begin. After such a long and laborious prologue, all parties need to expedite the process and ensure that justice is served before these old men and women die or the tribunal&apos;s funds run out.", "publicationDate": "2007-11-12T17:00:00Z", "tags": ["Cambodia", "Human rights", "China", "Extraordinary chambers in the courts of Cambodia", "Khmer Rouge", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/12/beyondthelawnomore", "title": "Beyond the law no more", "sentences": ["During the 1980s, Ieng Sary was the favoured conduit for Chinese funds and he collected at least a million dollars a year from Beijing&apos;s embassy in Bangkok from 1979-1990."]}, {"article": "After you&apos;ve tired of Bangkok&apos;s temples, revive yourself through the &apos;spirit&apos;-ual side of the city at these quintessential watering holes. 1.

An outdoor staircase seemingly ascends into the heavens and arrives at an open-air deck divided into an outdoor restaurant on one side and the Sky Bar on the other.

It&apos;s the paths of most resistance we love best.  At 7am, we&apos;re lurching over a rough emerald green sea on the Seatran ferry, a sea so beautiful yet so fierce it has one passenger throwing up overboard - 20 times. Lithe white limbs peek from beneath blue and pink sarongs. Six Oz Busers are on board, having hurtled by bus overnight to Chumphon port through a neon-lit Bangkok. The ferry stops at Koh Tao and Koh Phangan (famed for its full moon parties) before reaching Koh Samui, where it&apos;s difficult to tell where roads end and rivers begin, where spa resorts, massage shops and internet cafes crowd beneath palm trees heavy with coconuts. It is monsoon season in Samui, Thailand&apos;s third largest island, with mountain jungle at its heart but glorious beaches at its tips.  Luck shines upon us, though, for the worst of the storms dry out just before our arrival. Now, it rains all night, the sea crashing near our snug pine bungalows. But the days are hot and happy, so we can laze on the golden sands of Maenam beach in the north of the island. At the idyllic Home Bay resort, we reconvene with two of our group who sailed here earlier (the &quot;Ozzie Blondes&quot;), but alas, a couple planning to fly here from Bangkok don&apos;t make it due to a dangerously slippy runway.  We are adept at weathering storms and, with crocodile and snake farm, monkey theatre and elephant trekking here, much fun is found doing so. Some hire jeeps or motorbikes or brave their own two feet to explore. The familiar faces floating around the island are now glowing from massages; excited as they await a tailor-made ballgown, happily terrified by reptiles. Crocodiles lie like still-life paintings, camouflaged on stone, at the Samui Crocodile Farm. At least they are confined within their pens and not on the loose, like those from a Vietnamese farm where rain washed away the walls this week.  A python hisses at the snake charmer who taunts him and then kisses him on the nose. &quot;Thank you, Mr Cobra,&quot; he says, grinning. Lola the baboon cuddles up to its owner, who smiles into the camera and laughs, &quot;I look like ladyboy.&quot; Later that evening, a group of Oz Busers dress up as ladyboys, others watch the rugby.  I consider spending my life on this island, sipping grape juice at the Naplarn Villa restaurant, searching for the Buddha&apos;s footprint, visiting the Big Buddha statue, the waterfalls at Na Muang, venturing into the jungle. James and Natasha have sloshed through the island all day on their motorbike and we talk deep into the night at the Cocoa Caf\u00e9, competing with the humming crickets and the music - Everything&apos;s Gonna Be Alright - and, on this rainswept isle, you feel it really is (even if your favourite sandals are accidentally swept into the swollen sea). oz-bus.com", "publicationDate": "2007-11-17T23:50:54Z", "tags": ["Travel", "Road trips", "Thailand holidays"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/nov/17/saturday.roadtrips", "title": "London to Sydney by bus", "sentences": ["Bangkok to Koh Samui &apos;Samui flooded,&quot; the man dishing out delicious ice-cream warns, but in boiling Bangkok and after weeks of unrelenting heat, memories of rain have evaporated.", "Six Oz Busers are on board, having hurtled by bus overnight to Chumphon port through a neon-lit Bangkok.", "At the idyllic Home Bay resort, we reconvene with two of our group who sailed here earlier (the &quot;Ozzie Blondes&quot;), but alas, a couple planning to fly here from Bangkok don&apos;t make it due to a dangerously slippy runway."]}, {"article": "Why go now? The sun may be in short supply at this time of year but the Danish capital is still a perfect winter getaway. The festive season is celebrated in style - bars and restaurants become snug candlelit affairs, ice rinks pop up across the city, and you&apos;re never too far from a steaming cup of glogg (think mulled wine on steroids) or a warming aquavit (Danish schnapps). The Danes even have a special word, hygge, to describe a cosy, welcoming atmosphere. Add cutting-edge architecture, fantastic nightlife and stress-free connections via the gleaming Kastrup airport and you&apos;ll wonder why you don&apos;t go every year. Checking in Bang in the centre of the old town, the recently opened Hotel 27 (00 45 70 275627; hotel27.dk) offers beautifully formed minimalist rooms (doubles \u00a3130) plus an in-house Absolut Icebar where you don fur coat and gloves to sip vodka cocktails in sub-zero temperatures. Or opt for some Balinese style at the Carlton Hotel Guldsmeden (00 45 33 221500; hotelguldsmeden.dk) which has modern art on the walls, wooden floors and teak four-poster beds, from \u00a3100 a night for a double. If you&apos;re on a tighter budget, the Cab Inn chain (00 45 33 210400; cabinn.com) offers the best rates in town, with comfortable cabin-style en suites (\u00a360) at three central locations. Hit the streets As of last week, Tivoli Gardens (tivoli.dk), Copenhagen&apos;s world-famous theme park, has been transformed into a buzzing Christmas market, with fairy lights and stalls selling gifts and festive food and drink. From here, head over Radhuspladsen to the pedestrianised Stroget shopping street, where you&apos;ll find everything from H&amp;M to top Danish \u00fcber-trend labels Bruuns Bazaar and Malene Birger. While you&apos;re in the area, climb the 209-metre spiral ramp to the top of the Rundetaarn (Round Tower), a 350-year-old observatory offering fantastic views across the city. South across the Knippelsbro bridge you&apos;ll find Christiania, an area colonised by hippies in the early 1970s and still a partially self-governing &apos;free city&apos; full of vegetarian restaurants and cooperative shops. Groovy Pusher Street was once the home of hash dealers. Coffee break You can&apos;t visit Copenhagen without trying a Danish pastry, and the most authentic and delicious versions are to be found at Lagkagehuset (Torvegade 45) a perfect canal-side pit stop which has great views, and decent coffee, too. Neighbourhood watch Vesterbro, the former red-light district, is now one of the hippest areas of the city, full of trendy bars, edgy fashion boutiques and ethnic restaurants. It&apos;s also within staggering distance of the Carlsberg Visitors Centre (visitcarlsberg.dk; \u00a33.50) where you can learn how the perfect pint is created and sample some of the company&apos;s famous brews. Worked up an appetite? With more gourmet restaurants than the rest of Scandinavia put together, Copenhagen is a paradise for foodies. The latest stellar attraction is the double-Michelin-starred Noma (Strandgade 93; 00 45 32 963297; noma.dk) which dishes up perfectly crafted Nordic food at just about affordable prices (a three-course lunch will set you back \u00a330). For something quintessentially Danish try the smorrebrod (open sandwiches) at Ida Davidsen (Store Kongensgade 70; idadavidsen.dk; 00 45 33 913655) - with over 200 varieties, you are bound to find at least one that you like. Copenhagen also has a large Thai population and correspondingly good Thai food. For a little slice of Bangkok, head to Ranees (00 45 35 368505; ranees.dk) on Blagards Plads, where you will find Thai classics and lesser-known dishes such as fish balls with banana flowers, all made with fresh seasonal ingredients. The big night out Kick off your night with cocktails at Our Bar (Studiestr\u00e6de 7; ourbar.dk), the current hangout for Copenhagen&apos;s beautiful people, then follow the locals to the Norrebro district, the city&apos;s nightlife hotspot. Here you&apos;ll find stylish cafe-bars Sebastopol and Pussy Galore&apos;s Flying Circus on Sankt Hans Torv and the buzzing Apparatet club at Norrebrogade 184 (myspace.com/apparatet). The morning after The Danes are big fans of Sunday brunch, and you&apos;ll often find the bar where you were drinking the night before is serving huge plates of bacon, pancakes and eggs come morning. Check out the self-service brunch (\u00a37-\u00a39) at Bang &amp; Jensen (Istedgade 130; bangogjensen.dk) or the elegant Apropos (Halmtorvet 12; cafeapropos.dk) in Vesterbro.

And you can stop sniggering in the back row: the reason for Sven-Goran Eriksson&apos;s trip to the Thai capital had nothing to do with sex tourism, although some may think that, in its way, it was every bit as obscene. Eriksson returned from Bangkok not with a blushing Thai bride but with three Thai footballers, or at least the contracts binding them to Manchester City for the next three years. The deals were announced at a high-profile press conference in a Bangkok hotel, featuring a video message from Thaksin Shinawatra, City&apos;s new owner, who was removed from his post as Thailand&apos;s prime minister in a military coup a year ago and is in exile in Britain, one of the few politicians in the world to be simultaneously reviled by both a military dictatorship and Amnesty International. Democratic elections are promised for next month, and Eriksson&apos;s trip has been widely seen as part of Thaksin&apos;s attempt to renew his popularity within the country. Unable to stand for election while facing charges of financial impropriety, he is believed to have been financing the campaign of the People Power Party, and his successful takeover of City has kept his profile high with Thailand&apos;s millions of Premier League fans. The recruitment of the trio of Thai international players - Suree Sukha, a right-back, Kiatprawut Saiwaeo, a centre-back, and Teerasilp Dangda, a striker - is being seen in the same light. Should his party succeed in the polls, the charges against Thaksin would be dropped and the way cleared for his return. &quot;I&apos;m glad democracy is returning to Thailand and it&apos;s a pity that I couldn&apos;t be there,&quot; Thaksin said in the video message. &quot;My aims are to make a good reputation for Thailand, both in managing the club and creating new talented players.&quot; Plans were also announced for City to set up a football academy in Bangkok. In between autographing City shirts which had been handed to guests by Thaksin&apos;s daughters, Eriksson said the signings were not a direct order from City&apos;s new owner. &quot;We&apos;re a football team, and the players are footballers. We never discuss politics,&quot; he said. He added that he expected Sukha to appear in City&apos;s first-team squad next year while the other two would be sent to feeder clubs, probably in Belgium and Switzerland, to await work permits. &quot;We know this is political, but that is not the only reason,&quot; the head coach of the Thai national team, Charnwit Polcheewin, remarked with disarming honesty. Well, presumably the three new signings can actually play football. But the primary purpose of the transfers is as plain as the nose on Eriksson&apos;s face, and it makes a mockery of everyone, from Richard Scudamore to David Dein, who tries to pretend that the Premier League&apos;s new foreign owners are motivated solely by a lifelong love affair with English football - and also, incidentally, of anyone who believes that the wholesale influx of foreign players is not hampering the opportunities for young English footballers. Eriksson&apos;s instant success in reviving City&apos;s fortunes has given pleasure even to some who have no intrinsic affection for the club, partly thanks to the quality of their football but also through a widespread feeling that the supporters of a fine old club had suffered enough. It could be said, too, that they are not the only club to sign players for reasons that have little to do with football - the arrival of Dong Fan-Zhuo at Old Trafford was another glaring example, albeit impelled by commercial rather than political considerations. But the shenanigans in Bangkok last weekend were a sign of a pernicious and unnatural twist in the evolution of English football. Somewhere down the line, it can only end in tears. In search of lost time after Zamick&apos;s passing  When I was a boy, Chick Zamick was a local hero to match Tommy Lawton and Reg Simpson. He was a Canadian ice hockey player who had arrived shortly after the second world war to join the Nottingham Panthers, then struggling in the English national league. Over the next decade he led them to the championship while becoming the first professional anywhere in the game to score more than 1,000 points. In 1957 he left to spend a couple of seasons playing in Switzerland before retiring, which meant that I never got to see him play. But his name echoed around the Nottingham ice rink as we children stumbled about on rented skates, trying to master those sudden stops with which you send up a shower of ice crystals, preferably over a passing group of girls. Zamick, who was of Ukrainian descent, returned to settle in Nottingham, where he ran several businesses, including a squash club, a dry cleaner and a hairdresser. He died in his adopted hometown last month, aged 81, and when I read about it at the weekend I was momentarily transported back to a world of Zamboni ice-tractors and Wurlitzer organs and the beautiful leather Fagan hockey skates that lie, scuffed and rusted and unused since about the time the Beatles arrived, at the back of a cupboard somewhere in this very room. Cooke and Button have reasons to be cheerful There was good news for two British contenders last week. Jenson Button acquired the services of the cleverest man in formula one, and Nicole Cooke was given the sort of support that will enable her to have a decent crack at an Olympic gold medal next year. Cooke was bubbling with excitement as, on a rare visit to London from her training base in Italy, she talked about the new Great Britain women&apos;s road racing team with which she will ride next season. Knee surgery kept her out of the world championships this year and prevented her from defending her World Cup title, but her recovery has been accelerated by the willingness of Dave Brailsford, the far-sighted boss of British Cycling, to give her such wholehearted support. For Button, the arrival of Ross Brawn as Honda&apos;s technical director ends a desperate year on a note of optimism. Brawn masterminded all seven of Michael Schumacher&apos;s world titles, and if he can&apos;t put the wheels back on the Japanese team&apos;s effort, no one can. Button&apos;s resilience in adversity this season has lifted his reputation in the paddock; soon, perhaps, he will get a chance to race head to head with Lewis Hamilton.

Three out of those four writers were born outside the UK and draw on their experience as immigrants, a theme that also bubbles through in the main novel and poetry categories, via Rose Tremain&apos;s book about an east European who travels to Britain and Daljit Nagra&apos;s collection of poems, Look We Have Coming To Dover! Tahmima Anam, Nikita Lalwani and Roma Tearne, all shortlisted in the first novel category, were born in Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka respectively. Anam&apos;s A Golden Age is set against the backdrop of war in East Pakistan in 1971; Tearne&apos;s love story Mosquito also has a war setting, in Sri Lanka. Tearne travelled to Britain by boat as a child, and later trained as an artist at the Ruskin in Oxford; Anam was born in Dhaka, the daughter of a journalist, and brought up in Paris, New York and Bangkok. Gifted, by the Cardiff-raised Lalwani, charts the experiences of a young, talented immigrant to Britain whose parents&apos; expectations and her own desires sharply divide. The remaining book is by Catherine O&apos;Flynn, from Tindal Street Press, an independent publisher based in Birmingham that has been punching above its weight recently. What Was Lost is about a security guard and a retail manager who start watching, via CCTV, a lost little girl as she wanders through a shopping mall. In the main novel category the heaviest-hitting writer is Rose Tremain, whose The Road Home is about Lev, an eastern European who travels to Britain with little English and in search of work. Tremain has won the Costa novel award before, in its previous incarnation as the Whitbread, in 1999 for Music and Silence. The other contenders, A L Kennedy, Neil Bartlett and Rupert Thomson, are respected writers who have not broken into the top rank of household names. Bartlett is as well-known for his career in opera and theatre directing as for his writing. Kennedy also performs as a stand-up comedian. It has been an extremely successful year for Willesden schoolteacher Daljit Nagra, who won the Forward poetry prize for a first collection with Look We Have Coming To Dover!, and is now shortlisted for the Costa among established poets John Fuller, Ian Duhig and Jean Sprackland. In the biography section Julie Kavanagh&apos;s well-received work on Rudolf Nureyev is pitted against books including a cricketing memoir by former Guardian columnist Michael Simkins and Simon Sebag Montefiore&apos;s acclaimed Young Stalin.

Tate Liverpool hosts the Turner Prize this year. Photograph: David Sillitoe As the Guardian&apos;s northern editor, I am always in danger of being a northern bore, so please don&apos;t turn off when I start by hailing the presentation, and current exhibition, of this year&apos;s Turner Prize in Liverpool rather than London. Every time I use the word &quot;north&quot;, I also mean south, east or west and anything in between, so long as it is not in the capital city. This is the virtue of the new Northern Arts Prize whose four shortlisted contenders were unveiled last night at one of those packed consumptions of wine and nibbles beloved by the world of culture. It was in Leeds Art Gallery but it really could have been anywhere optimistic and thriving in the world; there was every age, type and accent present. The newly, handsomely restored Victorian building buzzed. More than \u00a320,000 will be handed out at the NAP award in January, but the benign effects of a really big deal - and do - like this are already working. Interest in the prize has stimulated new studios, given a healthy tug to regional networks and stimulated useful reminders of previous golden ages. It wasn&apos;t an accident or something in the water that produced both Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth at the same time from this part of the world. It was truly first-rate teaching at Leeds School of Art, plus a rich surrounding culture. I am not artistic enough to advise you which is the likely winner of the final four: Eric Bainbridge, Tim Brennan, Dan Holdsworth and Karen Guthrie and Nina Pope. But chatting to Karen and Nina, whose combination of film and displays includes their own Lake District honeycomb (two things I love) bore out the notion that shortlisting - or even just entering for the annual prize - stimulates talent. Another sipper and nibbler at the do was David Lascelles, former producer of Inspector Morse and heir to the wonderful arts treasure house of Harewood House near Leeds. He was equally pragmatic about the value of tugging artists, commissioners and exhibitions away from the overwhelming centre of gravity in London. Eric Bainbridge&apos;s New Modernist (Post-Bangkok) made out of an LED light bulb, rubber flex, melamine and iroko, drew plenty of comment. Among it, the view from a couple of his former teachers who had just been to see the Turner exhibition in Liverpool, that the Northern Arts Prize is fresher and better. That&apos;s us regionals, of course. Apart from London-bashing, we love having a go at one another too. But even Scousers will find the trip along the M62 worthwhile; and a bonus until December 20 is that by visiting Leeds Art Gallery you can buy a \u00a31 raffle ticket for the chance of owning an original by Damien Hirst, another northern artist made good who is giving his potential successors a hand. \u2022 Audio: Martin Wainwright meets the shortlisted artists (MP3).

This winter Liverpool is hosting the Turner, Manchester has New Contemporaries, and Leeds, lacking an art prize of its own, has established a new one: the Northern Art Prize, open to any artist based between South Yorkshire and Northumberland, with \u00a316,500 up for grabs. (The winner will be announced in January.) As ever with art prizes, making a judgement is like trying to draw comparisons between carpet slippers and artichokes - literally so in the case of Karen Guthrie and Nina Pope, as vegetables and knitted footwear are among the items included in the bring-and-buy stall they have set up in the gallery. The stall is Pope&apos;s and Guthrie&apos;s comment on fair trade and requires you to be extremely fair: all donations are to be placed in an honesty box underneath the table. The rice, from a remote Japanese village, is reputed to be the best in the world, and is a snip at \u00a36 a bag. There is also a south-east Asian influence to Eric Bainbridge&apos;s melamine and particle-board sculptures, which were inspired by a trip to Bangkok, but look more like MFI versions of Anthony Caro&apos;s welded steel assemblages. Perhaps it is a sign of the new prize&apos;s conservatism that two of the four finalists are landscape photographers: Tim Brennan&apos;s enlargements are hazy, digital watercolours captured on a mobile phone, while Dan Holdsworth&apos;s iridescent, long-exposure images make the earth look like an alien planet.

Before its closure by the Nazis in 1933, the Bauhaus school represented a surge of modernist creative optimism for the entire western world. With participants ranging from the architects Walter Gropius and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe through to painters Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky and Josef Albers, the Bauhaus school pulled together all the most radical trends of innovative creativity at the time. Kandinsky was pushing a kind of psychic semi-spiritualistic abstraction, Klee was taking his drawn lines for walks into introversion and Mies was cementing the groundworks of 20th-century urban geography. A crazy overload of talent. Robert Clark  \u00b7  Middlesbrough Institute Of Modern Art, to Feb 17 Bloomberg New Contemporaries 2007  Manchester The New Contemporaries survives as perhaps the most engaging indication of what the artistically up and coming are up to. Selected from final year British art students and recent graduates, the open submission of some 1,200 works is weeded down to an always contentious representation of aspiring creative, daring and cultural mischief. No doubt about it, this could be the gateway to superstardom this year for newcomers such as Steve Bishop, Camilla Kesterton, Heike Kabish and Charlie Crane. RC  \u00b7  Cornerhouse, to Jan 20 Carey Young  Oxford Andy Warhol may have thought that &quot;good business is the best art&quot;, but the corporate world has rarely been a subject to inspire artistic creativity. Not so for Carey Young. Over the past decade she has immersed herself in the world of business, performing with motivational speakers, installing a call centre which gave out information about her, and framing disclaimers between the artist, the viewer and the gallery. Her new performance uses the skills of a public speaking club called Toastmasters. Do they succeed in giving Young the kind of gravitas needed for big business? Go along and find out. Jessica Lack  \u00b7  Oxford Town Hall, Sat 24, 1pm-3pm Santiago Sierra  London The art world&apos;s popular mischief-maker Santiago Sierra returns to stir up more trouble. The last time he was in London he hooded 10 Iraqi locals and sprayed them with Polyurethane foam as a toxic testimonial to the abuse suffered by the prisoners of Baghdad. His art is always this provocative, ridiculing social structures and capitalism&apos;s dominance over the weak. Many of his performances focus on the effect of economic systems on the labouring classes, such as when he employed illegal workers at the minimum wage to carry blocks of concrete in a protest against inhuman work conditions. As always, the installation he is planning is a secret, but will no doubt be as astute and acerbic as ever. JL \u00b7  Lisson Gallery, NW1, Fri 30 to Jan 19 Utagawa Hiroshige &amp; Alice Cattaneo Birmingham An intriguing show of 19th-century woodblock prints by Utagawa Hiroshige, curated by the painter Julian Opie. While Opie&apos;s own work tends towards a faux-naif celebration of pop, Hiroshige&apos;s prints come across as embodiments of nature&apos;s awesome lyrical grace. Here are some of the most unforgettable landscape images of all time. The dusk, the moon, Mount Fuji - Hiroshige evokes those all too rare moments when everyday hassle appears to calm down to states of perceptual enchantment. As an accompaniment, Alice Cattaneo&apos;s DIY sculptures and lo-tech videos try to summon heady themes through back-to-basics means. Her materials are ordinary - cardboard, tape - but her subjects are big and bold. A muted humour results. RC  \u00b7  Ikon Gallery, Wed 28 to Jan 20 Allen Jones  London Pop artist Allen Jones turns 70 this year and to celebrate, this gallery are exhibiting new paintings by the one-time feminist scourge. Jones is most famous for three sculptures he made in the 1960s called Table, Chair and Hat Stand, which transformed semi-naked, leather-clad female mannequins into furniture. Unsurprisingly, they got on the tits of the burning bra brigade and were immediately derided as misogynistic. Yet Jones&apos;s sculptures captured the ambiguous nature of the 1960s free love era, in particular highlighting the discrepancies between female emancipation and sexual experimentation. Many of his works allude to the fetishism he discovered in New York around this time, and even today, his paintings still retain the seedy glamour of S&amp;M in vibrant acid colours. JL  \u00b7  Alan Cristea Gallery, W1, Mon 26 to Dec 22 Northern Art Prize  Leeds While the whole attention-seeking palaver of competition might be of questionable cultural worth, the new Northern Art Prize show, which guarantees the winner \u00a316,500, promises an intriguing take on how northern artists crave international viewpoints and profiles. Selected by a panel including 2001 Turner Prize winner Martin Creed, the artists here come across as wide-eyed super tourists. Tim Brennan and Dan Holdsworth feed off the wild landscapes of Iceland, the Spanish Sierra Nevada and homeland north-east England; Eric Bainbridge presents sculptures heavily influenced by his visits to Bangkok; and Nina Pope and Karen Guthrie, who work collaboratively under the enticingly enigmatic name Somewhere, come on like hostesses in a round trip from the UK to the Czech Republic. RC  \u00b7  Leeds Art Gallery, to Feb 10 Anthony McCall  London The influential 1970s film-maker Anthony McCall was part of a minimalist band of creative brothers whose pared down aesthetic translated onto celluloid as simple but striking acts of cultural intervention. A Brit who emigrated to New York in the early 1970s at a time when the macho boys of minimalism were colonising warehouses in the lower east side, McCall sought to recreate the angular geometry of industrial sculpture in his film works. One of his most seminal pieces was Line Describing A Cone, a sharp slice of light that slowly materialises over 30 minutes and gradually becomes visible through smoke and dust. His work has been a cult secret in the UK, even though his work with digital projectors and 16mm film has garnered him several generations of fans. This retrospective will provide, at the very least, an opportunity to see one of the greatest manipulators of light in action.

Despite making row after arm-aching row of sushi balls weighing exactly 20 grams, the wooden pail of rice is seemingly bottomless. Patience, combined with nimble fingers and a penchant for precision, are clearly the most useful ingredients when attempting to master the art of sushi making - as I&apos;m learning the hard way. Since moving to Tokyo three months ago, I have eaten sushi every day. Well, it&apos;s hard not to. As well as local sushi counter restaurants on almost every street, a raft of high-end outlets elevate raw fish and rice to an art form. Best of all is the Tsukiji fish market. Having navigated the pre-dawn rush of market workers haggling loudly over an eclectic array of maritime creatures, the undisputed highlight is tucking into the freshest sushi in town at one of the low-key restaurants that cling to its fringes. The setting is usually little more than a room with a long counter, but the quality of the sushi is superb.  Now I&apos;m a resident, I felt the time had come to learn how to make sushi myself - primarily to impress visiting friends. Tokyo Sushi Academy is the only school in the country devoted to teaching the professional art of sushi making, training more than 100 chefs every year. But beginners&apos; courses are also available. A towering tangle of green bamboo covers the facade of the main classroom in a quiet Tokyo sidestreet. Converted from a traditional basement sushi restaurant, the space has retained its long sushi bar, tatami mat flooring and kanji menu on wooden blocks hanging on the wall. But the action takes place in the vast white kitchen at the back. Here, apron in place, jewellery removed and hands scrubbed clean, I take my place around a long steel table. Our mission today is to create a platter of perfect nigiri sushi - mounds of rice with raw fish perched on the top. Fortunately, there are two sensei (teachers) dressed in whites, assisting half a dozen students, each of whom has been issued with a chopping board, bowl of tezu (vinegar and water), electric weighing scales and a pail of cooked rice. &quot;First of all, you must pick up in your right hand exactly 20 grams of rice,&quot; says the teacher. This proves tricky. My first two attempts are too heavy, the next three too light - until I eventually manage an acceptable 19 grams. Next, we are instructed to follow a very precise routine of movements - rolling, wedging, squeezing and turning - before laying the rice ball down on the wooden platter. When the rice is finally finished, maybe some 30 minutes later, the teachers smile at my efforts - then happily discard my carefully crafted balls. &quot;That was just practice,&quot; laughs one teacher. Next, intricate diagrams are drawn on a whiteboard showing the angle at which raw fish should be cut in two. Narrowly avoiding severing the tips of my fingers, I work through a pile of mackerel fillets,before being shown how to score the surface of a pile of chopped ika (squid). The next step is attaching the fish and squid to fresh rice with dab of wasabi (horseradish paste) - my heart sinks at the prospect of more rice ball making. But once more, a sense of rhythm takes over and eventually my wooden platter is filled with something that resembles sushi, completed with a garnish of grated ginger and onions. The piece de resistance is the shaped bamboo leaf which decorates the plate. While I am not able to master the sensei&apos;s ability to rustle up a bird in a single cut, I create an almost acceptable abstract pattern to adorn my platter. The ultimate test then arrives: we carry our platters down to the sushi bar. Cups of green tea and hashi (chopsticks) delegated, we tuck in. My mackerel cut may be wonky and the use of wasabi inconsistent, but it is tastier than it looks. In fact, it&apos;s really very tasty indeed.  \u00b7  Tokyo Sushi Academy (0081 3 5319 1480, sushi.ne.jp) has three-hour private classes ranging from \u00a522,500pp (\u00a3101) for groups of eight people to \u00a540,000 for one person.

If anything was going to soften the blow of leaving behind the lions, elephants, leopards, buffalos and Samburu tribespeople of Kenya - did I mention I was on holiday? - it was the rumour that England had dismissed Sri Lanka for 188 on the first day of a series they were generally expected to lose. In fact, I&apos;d go so far as to say there was a spring in my step when I got up this morning: Kenyan time is three hours ahead of GMT and since we were dragged out of our tents every morning at 6am to go in search of reticulated giraffes and the like, my 3.45 alarm call today actually represented a luxurious lie-in. It was all I could do to stop myself waking up my Dutch flatmate and suggesting a quick hunt for the border collies and guinea pigs of SW18. But I digress. England, you will recall, are 49 for 1, with Michael Vaughan not out 13 and Ian Bell a sparkling 36 off 44 balls. It&apos;s a situation even the most pessimistic of England fans/OBO writers might call promising. But... (and you didn&apos;t think you&apos;d get away without a &quot;but&quot;, did you?) there is always the Murali factor. Monty got some frightening turn yesterday and Murali is itching to take the five wickets he needs to pass Shane Warne&apos;s tally of 708. Sir Beefy has even ventured the view that he is &quot;going to be a real handful&quot;. Well, stop the presses! Here, for what it is worth, is how I see it. England still need to be batting at stumps if they are going to win this game. If not, they will not have enough runs in the bank to counterbalance of batting last on a pitch that will probably get more uneven. An email! &quot;Just got in from a night out where my best friend (girl) got with my, er, best friend (boy) while I stood around being a distinctly out of season gooseberry,&quot; complains Nick Banks. &quot;Any chance you could ensure Vaughan and Bell slog Murali to all parts of Kandy to cheer me up please? Thank you.&quot; Never let it be said the OBO doesn&apos;t bring you the news that matters. 18th over: England 57-1 (Vaughan 13, Bell 44) The definitive ice-breaker from Bell, who straight-drives Dilhara Fernando&apos;s first ball of the day to the on-side of the stumps and away for four. That was sumptuous. The last ball brings four more, but that was lucky: an attempted work to leg took the inside edge, hit the thigh pad and dribbled away past the diving Prasanna Jayawardene behind the stumps. Meanwhile, Gary Naylor - who else? - is still upset about the length of England&apos;s tail. &quot;All the talk before the match was about how the pitch would be seamer-friendly, yet after just one day, the talk is about how the pitch will favour the spinners,&quot; he wails. &quot;I&apos;ve always thought that the weather is far more important than the pitch and that England should play two spinners far more often in hot conditions. Swann for Anderson would improve the batting and the bowling.&quot; 19th over: England 61-1 (Vaughan 14, Bell 47) Vaughan works his first ball of the day from Chaminda Vaas to midwicket for a single, before Bell uses an open face to guide him to third man for three. This is a flyer by Bell, but Aleem Dar doesn&apos;t like the fact that he ran straight down the middle of the pitch. A quick word is had. &quot;Vic Marks thinks Kumar Sangakkara might be a better batsman than Ponting and Kallis,&quot; says James Braybrook, currently en route to Taupo in New Zealand. &quot;How do you rate him and is he as good as Rob Key?&quot; It&apos;s a tricky one, James. You&apos;re talking about four modern legends. 20th over: England 65-1 (Vaughan 14, Bell 51) Murali looms like a small, looming thing at mid-on, but it&apos;s Fernando who continues to Bell, who brings up an exquisite 57-ball half-century with a flick for four through midwicket. Now he needs to turn it into a big one. &quot;Been doing my geography coursework all night (due in Monday!) and I can tell you the cricket has come as a welcome break... from sand-dune succession,&quot; reveals Guy Stevenson. 21st over: England 70-1 (Vaughan 15, Bell 55) Vaughan, almost anonymous so far and lucky still to be there after apparently falling lbw to Lasith Malinga yesterday before he had scored, pushes the first ball of Vaas&apos;s new over into the covers for a single. But it&apos;s merely the prelude for a picture-perfect drive for four through extra cover by Bell, who is playing like a diminutive demi-god. I think he&apos;s loving being back at No3, a position he last filled in Tests at Sydney in January. &quot;Interesting that you should claim that Botham is (as is his wont) stating the bleedin&apos; obvious in saying that Murali will be a handful, because he was totally anonymous in the two Tests in Australia last month,&quot; says, yes, Gary Naylor. &quot;It was noticeable that the Aussies almost ran at him, so swift were they on their feet, so Murali couldn&apos;t settle into a line and length. I hope England don&apos;t retreat to their &quot;block it or sweep it&quot; mentality.&quot; 22nd over: England 71-1 (Vaughan 16, Bell 55) Vaughan is struggling with his timing a little, but he is also being made to look worse by the man at the other end. Even the way Bell is leaning on his bat at the non-striker&apos;s end exudes confidence, although that might just be my fevered imagination (not malarial, I might add: the mosquitoes in Kenya were thwarted by a combination of doxycyclin and loose-fitting, ankle-and-wrist length garments). Vaughan nudges Fernando&apos;s fifth ball into a gap at midwicket for a single and Bell defends the final delivery with ease. 23rd over: England 78-1 (Vaughan 22, Bell 55) A quiet over springs into life as Vaas finds a bit of lift outside off and surprises Vaughan, who skilfully rides the bounce and collects four to third man. It was a no-ball too, so that&apos;s five to the England total. Replays show that delivery disturbed the surface. Interesting. The over is completed by two to Vaughan - a nudge off his hip. 24th over: England 78-1 (Vaughan 22, Bell 55) This is all going rather swimmingly for England. Mahela Jayawardene would love to attack a new batsman with Murali, but Vaughan and Bell are not giving him the chance. Fernando is beginning to settle into his line after a shaky start, but Bell is resolute in defence, even if he does leave one delivery that wasn&apos;t a million miles away from off-stump. And then, just as I write that, a ball keeps low and shoots through. The message is clear: England need to win this game in the first innings. A maiden. 25th over: England 78-1 (Vaughan 22, Bell 55) Ah. Here comes Murali. Beefy is convinced he should have come on earlier, and I think I probably agree: these two have played themselves in. His threat is immediately apparent as he finds lavish turn into Vaughan and then unnerves him with a couple of doosras. Jayawardene does his part by intercepting a thick outside edge at slip: superb fielding. And another maiden. 26th over: England 79-1 (Vaughan 22, Bell 56) Bell picks up his first run for five overs by tucking Fernando off his hip for a single, but every other over now feels like a Murali interlude. &quot;The doxycycline was thwarting the plasmodia (or plasmodiums - dunno I did woodwork not Latin) falciparum not the mosquitoes,&quot; says Dr John Williams, who works in the Infectious Diseases department at the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough. &quot;The mosquitoes are merely taxi drivers.&quot; I stand educated. 27th over: England 83-1 (Vaughan 22, Bell 60) Bell faces Murali for the first time in the innings and is almost undone by the second delivery, which skids onto the batsman as he backs away. Was he expecting the doosra? And the same thing happens three balls later. Bell responds with a slightly desperate slog that brings him four runs over midwicket. But he was nowhere near the pitch of that. Another gripe from Gary Naylor. &quot;Although I hate myself for saying it, Sky Sports really do us cricket fans proud with their coverage,&quot; he begins magnanimously. &quot;Apart from employing too many dull commentators, they don&apos;t miss many tricks, so why is the speedgun reading in kph? 90mph for the fast men and 50mph for the spinners are excellent benchmarks which don&apos;t translate to kph easily. The pitch is still 22 yards in length isn&apos;t it?&quot; 28th over: England 87-1 (Vaughan 26, Bell 60) That&apos;s Vaughan&apos;s best shot of the morning (or possibly his only shot of the morning): four off his hip as Fernando strays onto middle and leg. Beefy discerns reverse-swing. &quot;Definitely reverse,&quot; he confirms. Expect Malinga any time soon. &quot;I had my work christmas party on Friday night (in Sydney),&quot; says James Clarke. &quot;Back in work today, sat opposite one of the senior bosses. I&apos;ve just had a flashback to her on the dancefloor, dancing with some random guy - and her pulling her skirt up and flashing him. I was the only one to see this (apart from said random guy), and as I remember, I spent the next hour telling anyone who&apos;d listen about it. Now she&apos;s looking quite sheepish, and has said nothing to me. Could be standard post-party sheepishness. Possibly seething anger towards a minion who&apos;s contributed to the blackening of her name? How shall I handle this?&quot; I&apos;d begin by keeping it a secret, James. Whatever you do, don&apos;t let the story reach the internet. 29th over: England 90-1 (Vaughan 27, Bell 61) Bell reaches a long way outside off-stump as he tries to sweep Murali&apos;s first ball. He gets a bottom edge onto his boot and is relieved to see the ball fall safely in the gulley. Murali then spins one so far that it would have missed a third set of stumps and scoots away for a bye, before Vaughan drives fluently to wide mid-off for a single. Bell keeps the strike with a push to mid-on - nice use of the feet. 30th over: England 94-1 (Vaughan 27, Bell 65) Vaas replaces Fernando, and Bell goes down the track to his first ball, picking out mid-off with a drive that oozed fluency. If that&apos;s possible. And then, two balls later, he collects four, timing a slightly wider ball through the covers off the back foot. It was a bad ball, but punished perfectly. Are we seeing the making of Bell? Or will you all be emailing me in 15 minutes&apos; time to curse me for putting the mockers on him? The latter, I suspect. &quot;The official defintion is actually One Chain, which happens to be 22 yards,&quot; says Sunil X. &quot;10 chains = 1 furlong. I&apos;m not sure how many rods, poles or perches are involved. It&apos;s been a very long time since I had a school exercise book that had the conversion tables printed on the back of it.&quot; 31st over: England 95-1 (Vaughan 28, Bell 65) Vaughan is covering his off-stump against Murali with typical diligence and even seems to be able to pick the doosra: he was ready and waiting for that one. A thick inside edge to backward square for a single gives him the strike. &quot;Any views on Vaughan as opener?&quot; wonders Gary Naylor. &quot;He leaves the ball so well, his shot selection is excellent and he is England&apos;s (maybe cricket&apos;s) most patient batsman - what more can one want in an opener? Michael Vaughan might not like Michael Vaughan at the top of the order, but I do.&quot; I like Michael Vaughan as an opener too, Gary. Not least because it frees Bell up to bat at No3, which is where he feels valued. 32nd over: England 97-1 (Vaughan 29, Bell 65) Vaughan shovels Vaas down the ground for a single and England have batted for an hour this morning without losing a wicket. Heady stuff. A no-ball cuts the deficit to 91, and then Bell almost edges a ball that goes across him after using his feet to Vaas. Does he need to do that when he&apos;s playing so well? &quot;James Clarke (28th over) should send his post-Christmas party query to one of those magazines that can be found a little higher up the newsagent&apos;s shelves than The Wisden Cricketer,&quot; quips Gary Naylor. &quot;I am led to believe that there is an avid readership for such material and no shortage of forthright advice.&quot; I&apos;m led to believe that too. 33rd over: England 98-1 (Vaughan 30, Bell 65) Murali almost strikes with his second ball after the drinks break: Vaughan goes back as he prepares to cut but the ball follows him and he gets an inside edge to leg. Lucky. Murali then goes round the wicket and immediately surprises Vaughan with some extra bounce: the result is a single off a thick edge, an outside one this time. Incidentally, the clouds are rolling in. Bumble is talking nervously about a monsoon. 34th over: England 107-1 (Vaughan 37, Bell 67) Vaughan brings up the 100 stand with a glorious pull for four off Vaas, who has been unusually expensive today, and then adds a couple with a trademark flick off his hip. All the hard work early in his innings is starting to pay off now. Bell keeps his score ticking over with a tuck for two to the midwicket gap. Sri Lanka need two wickets before lunch to hang on in here. &quot;You can only listen to TMS on line in the UK &apos;due to rights restrictions&apos;,&quot; says Tom &quot;No Relation&quot; Bell in Bangkok. &quot;Has anyone got any idea how you can get it working elsewhere?&quot; WICKET! Vaughan c Silva b Muralitharan 37 (107-2) And there&apos;s one of the wickets. Murali goes round the wicket, Vaughan misses an attempted work to leg and the ball ricochets to Chamara Silva at silly point. Aleem Dar raises the finger, but Vaughan doesn&apos;t like it, departing with a shake of the head. The first replay is inconclusive: did he touch it? Hard to say. 35th over: England 107-2 (Bell 67, Pietersen 0) Well, if Vaughan did get an inside edge, it wasn&apos;t obvious from the replay. In fact, I&apos;d say Dar got that one wrong: Vaughan certainly thought so. He had the look of a man who had just arrived home from work to find his wife making love to to the plumber. 36th over: England 116-2 (Bell 76, Pietersen 0) Anyway, the upshot of that Dar mistake is that Murali now has 705 Test wickets: four more and he will pass Warne. Still, Vaughan shouldn&apos;t grumble: he was lbw to Malinga on 0 yesterday evening. Bell needs to reassert himself once more, and runs Vaas to third man for four, before repeating the dose with more confidence next ball. A back-foot push to deep cover means Bell will face Murali in the next over. &quot;James Clarke&apos;s experience reminds me of our Christmas party in Melbourne last year,&quot; says Ian Forth. &quot;The theme was &quot;what you wanted to be when you grew up&quot;. A senior client came as a lifeguard and wore just a pair of groin hugging red speedos all night. I felt quite overdressed as Chris Cattlin, Coventry City left back from the early 70s (who now runs a rock shop in Brighton, fact fans), but did boast an authentic green and black striped away strip from the era which I had gone to some trouble to procure. Shouldn&apos;t have bothered - &quot;Spider&quot; Cattlin is hardly a household name in Coventry, let alone Melbourne, and I didn&apos;t even get mistaken for Tommy Hutchison or Willie Carr. This year the theme is magic. I&apos;m thinking of coming as a wand. Any better suggestions welcome.&quot; Paul Daniels? Debbie McGee? The Great Soprendo? 37th over: England 118-2 (Bell 77, Pietersen 1) Bell is looking to be positive against Murali, but it isn&apos;t easy unless you can pick his variations and I&apos;m not convinced Bell can do that just yet. Murali has tested him out a few times with a quicker ball that cramps Bell for space, but now he goes round the wicket and Bell sweeps him for a single. Kevin Pietersen has begun quietly before using those long levers to sweep the last ball of the over for a single. &quot;Do Investec, no doubt a high-powered financial group populated by Sherman McCoyesque Masters of the Universe, know that they sponsor a drinks trolley that looks like it last saw service on a 1970s British Rail train?&quot; asks the ever-inquisitive Gary Naylor. 38th over: England 120-2 (Bell 78, Pietersen 2) Prasanna Jayawardene comes up to the stumps to dissuade Pietersen from going walkabout against Vaas. But he&apos;s not going to go anywhere too early in his innings and contents himself with an awkward-looking jab into the covers for a single. Bell keeps the strike with a gentl push to deep point. Half an hour to go before lunch. &quot;Ian Forth (36th over) could procure a black bin from which he could emerge from time to time dressed as a white rabbit,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;Well, it&apos;s no more ridiculous than pitching up as Chris Cattlin.&quot; 39th over: England 126-2 (Bell 82, Pietersen 4) Murali stays round the wicket, but he drops short and Bell has time to rock back and force him into the covers for three. Pietersen is then saved by an inside edge as the ball barely leaves the surface: oohs and aahs everywhere, and Pietersen might be relieved to escape the examination with a tuck to square-leg for one. Bell repays the favour with a single into the covers, before Pietersen leans back to take one more into the same region. Engrossing stuff. 40th over: England 130-2 (Bell 82, Pietersen 8) Here comes Malinga, who will test the batsmen in a different way: if he can locate the reverse-swing hinted at earlier by Fernando, Sri Lanka might fancy their chances of parting these two before lunch. The fourth ball is full - although it didn&apos;t swing a great deal - and Pietersen gets a thick outside edge to third man for four as he aimed to leg. 41st over: England 130-2 (Bell 82, Pietersen 8) The next 20 minutes are crucial: one dismissal brings in a new batsman to face Murali, and that could mean two wickets. With the tail England have - Ryan Sidebottom is at No8, for goodness sake - that could spell trouble. But if these two can survive until lunch, then dig in after the break, it will be Sri Lanka who will worry. A maiden from Murali to Bell, who seems to be reading the doosra now. 42nd over: England 132-2 (Bell 83, Pietersen 9) Pietersen makes sure everyone knows that ball from Malinga kept low, which it did. And which, at the risk of repeating myself, shows how important a decent first-innings lead is here for England. Pietersen whips a single to deep midwicket - Jayawardene is having to balance defence with attack - but Malinga is striving for reverse-swinging yorkers and lets out a cry of anguish as Bell gets a thick inside edge into the leg-side as he aims to drive. A single to third man gives Bell the strike. &quot;The paranoia kicked in momentarily, but I&apos;ve looked at her screen and she doesn&apos;t appear to be logged into the OBO,&quot; says James Clarke (see over 28). &quot;Hardly surprising considering she&apos;s an Australian pom-basher. My cyber outburst might not reach her after all. Ian Forth (over 36): how about going as Timmy Mallett&apos;s erstwhile sidekick?&quot; WICKET! Bell c Silva b Muralitharan 83 (132-3) What a catch from Silva, who dives high to his left at short midwicket to end a super innings from Bell. He went down the track to Murali&apos;s last ball and didn&apos;t quite get hold of it. A century was his for the taking. And lunch was only 15 minutes away. Oh Belly. &quot;Late, here in San Francisco,&quot; says Jeremy Bunting. &quot;My girlfriend, Christine (an American) is baffled by cricket (and calls football &apos;soccer&apos;) and think its simply *weird* that I don&apos;t &apos;watch&apos; the sport or listen to commentary - but *read* it! Is she right?&quot; I think you know the answer to that question, Jezza. 44th over: England 139-3 (Pietersen 14, Collingwood 1) So, Murali now has 706 Test wickets: two more to equal Warne, three to pass him. I think he&apos;ll do it today. And if England aren&apos;t careful he will do it quickly enough to put Sri Lanka right back in the match. Pietersen holds the key for the time being, and manoeuvres Malinga into the off-side for a single. Ideally, he will be facing Murali at the start of the next over. But Paul Collingwood works Malinga&apos;s fifth ball to deep midwicket for one to get off the mark. And although Pietersen whips the scheduled last ball, a no-ball, for four - Malinga is still striving for leg-stump yorkers - Collingwood will have to deal with Murali. 45th over: England 139-3 (Pietersen 14, Collingwood 1) What was I worrying about? Collingwood defends Murali with relative ease, but Murali makes the ball misbehave out of the rough outside the right-hander&apos;s leg-stump. A maiden. 46th over: England 145-3 (Pietersen 18, Collingwood 1) Malinga drops short and Pietersen simply murders him through cover off the back foot for four. Malinga changed his length in that over, doing away with the yorkers, but Asad Rauf no-balls one of his effort deliveries (for overstepping, I hasten to add, not chucking), and that might prevent Murali for fitting in another over. Another no-ball as Malinga tries to tempt Pietersen into a crazy hook just before the break, but that is lunch. England have scored 96 for the loss of Vaughan (unluckily) and Bell (caught brilliantly). There&apos;s still a lot to play for, so join me at 7.40am GMT for live coverage of the second session. But before we go... &quot;Thanks for your suggestions,&quot; says Ian Forth. &quot;Maybe I&apos;ll go as Alessandro del Piero who I seem to remember was/is called the &quot;magician&quot;. I can wear the same shirt as last year and claim that Inter Milan play in green and black stripes since no-one will be any the wiser in Aussie-Rules-obsessed Melbourne.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-12-02T09:52:03Z", "tags": ["Over by over reports", "Cricket", "Sport", "England in Sri Lanka 2007-08", "Michael Vaughan"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/dec/02/overbyoverreports.cricket", "title": "Over-by-over: morning session", "sentences": ["&quot;You can only listen to TMS on line in the UK &apos;due to rights restrictions&apos;,&quot; says Tom &quot;No Relation&quot; Bell in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "EMERGENCY SERVICES For a man who&apos;s supposed to be suave, sophisticated and a Special One, Jose Mourinho&apos;s attempts to woo the English FA blazers have been about as subtle and undignified as the Fiver&apos;s attempts to woo women at the Marion Hall disco in Birr, County Offaly circa 1988. Apparently too &quot;cool&quot; to approach FA big cheese Brian Barwick himself, Jose&apos;s sent his best friend over to let it be known that &quot;my mate fancies you&quot; instead. And while this ham-fisted tactic resulted in one shameful weekly humiliation after another for the Fiver, the signs are that it&apos;s already working well for the smouldering former Chelsea boss. According to his media consultant, Mourinho would consider becoming the new England manager if the FA approached him, but he has no intention of actively pursuing the gig himself. &quot;It would be something he&apos;d consider.

Parames then went on to sneer at cynics like the Fiver who think Mourinho is only feigning interest in the England job to make suits at Barcelona and Milan jealous. &quot;These are lies, Jose is not waiting for an approach from these clubs,&quot; he snapped. &quot;Jose has had no approach from any club and no one has contacted [his agent].&quot; So there you have it - there&apos;s been no formal contact, although England&apos;s Brave John Terry is reported to have taken time out from cavorting drunkenly on stage with scantily-clad ladies to put out even more informal feelers on the FA&apos;s behalf. Although he has no intention of seeking out the England job as long as he has media advisers to seek it out on his behalf, the Special One has let it be known that he&apos;s been working on a blueprint for English football success which includes building a new hotel at Burton for Ashley Young to pleasure himself in, before replacing England&apos;s Arsenal physio Gary Lewin with a full-time medical department unconnected with any Premier League team. That probably rules out the South Central Ambulance Service, so viciously traduced by Mourinho after Petr Cech fractured his skull at Reading last season. To the best of the Fiver&apos;s knowledge, the classy future England/Barcelona/Milan manager hasn&apos;t apologised to them yet. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;I&apos;m not saying footballers should save the environment and change the NHS, but if we portrayed ourselves 15% better then it would help&quot; - Blackburn keeper Brad Friedel explains that it&apos;s up to online onanist Ashley Young and other young players to change public perceptions of Premier League footballers as gormless morons with more money than manners. ********************* JOEY Monday is often a slow day in the world of football, but not this one. No, because on this day Newcastle ace Joey Barton will appear on the Inside Sport show on obscure satellite TV station BBC1 where he will tearfully and exclusively repent his past sins. The maligned midfielder will weep openly as he discusses a catalogue of juvenile disasters including: stabbing trainee player Jamie Tandy in the eye with a cigar at Human Rights FC&apos;s 2004 Christmas party, so viciously that now Tandy&apos;s only good enough to play for Droylsden; causing a 10-man brawl in a friendly - a friendly! - against Doncaster; being sent home from a pre-season tour after an &quot;altercation&quot; with a 15-year-old Everton fan in the Bangkok Radisson hotel which apparently led to him being bitten in the hand by his captain, Richard Dunne; breaking a pedestrian&apos;s leg while driving through Liverpool at 2am in 2005; allegations - unproved, our lawyers add - of causing criminal damage to a taxi in March this year; more allegations, of causing facial injuries to his former Manchester City team-mate Ousmane Dabo in a training-ground attack; and dropping his shorts to Everton fans, some of whom were children and one of whom might have been the same poor chap he had previously slapped in Thailand. Oh hang on, we&apos;ve just been handed a transcript of the interview. Now we can give you a full account of his lachrymose breakdown, complete with revealing quote. Wait a minute, we&apos;ll find the apology any second now. Won&apos;t be long. &quot;I&apos;ve done nothing wrong ... I can go home and sleep at night and know I&apos;ve done what I thought was right ... I don&apos;t think I&apos;m a bad person ...&quot; Er. Must be on page two. Dum de dum de dum. &quot;... If the incidents had been to anyone other than a Premier League footballer I don&apos;t think they&apos;d even be mentioned ... Nobody cares whether I&apos;m innocent or guilty ... You shouldn&apos;t be slaughtered for trying to make yourself a better person ... One day I will get to speak about the full facts ...&quot; Bah! So the bad news is there&apos;s no apology. The good news is he&apos;s promised to give another, even more exclusive interview sometime in the future. Consider the Fiver&apos;s breath held. Still, the future former Newcastle manager Sam Allardyce has backed his future former player. &quot;Joey is a strong man with a strong opinion,&quot; he said while waiting for a podgy bloke in a replica kit to finish filling in his P45. &quot;He likes to say what he thinks.&quot; But then Allardyce has other stuff to worry about - a combination of his own rampant unpopularity and the prospect of Arsenal visiting on Wednesday. &quot;I cannot do a job other than by doing it the right way,&quot; he bigsammed. &quot;You know what works, and you know what doesn&apos;t work. You know what&apos;s right, and what&apos;s not right. Just because you get one or two bad results [er, seven actually. And some draws] it doesn&apos;t change the way you work.&quot; You see, Sam simply can&apos;t let a couple of bad results worry him. At Newcastle there are more scary things. Joey Barton, for a start. ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Bayern Munich&apos;s Willy Sagnol will don a beret and a big red flag when he attempts to pass himself off as Che Neville in the MU Rowdies defence come January time.

Paolo Bandini says the chances of stopping Inter in Serie A are between slim and none. And slim just entered a Buddhist monastery for a year&apos;s silent retreat.

See? Ipswich will find a better way of paying off their debts of \u00a332m when the entrepreneur Marcus Evans buys up 87.5% of the club. The takeover is expected to be rubberstamped at a shareholders&apos; meeting on December 17. Jolly family man Neville Southall has successfully sued his daughter for \u00a355,000 worth of trophies. Southall gave the memorabilia to her when she was 10, but now wants them back. &quot;I&apos;m devastated,&quot; his daughter Sam said. &quot;I idolised my dad. I don&apos;t know how I&apos;ll pay the costs [which amount to \u00a35,000].&quot; A match in Peru had to be abandoned at the weekend after Sport Ancash midfielder Efrain Viafara used his big, fat backside to control the ball, a move the opposition interpreted as an insult. &quot;If they had sent off Viafara none of this would have happened,&quot; said Universitario captain Mayer Candelo. A spokesman for Carson Yeung has insisted his takeover of Bongo FC will go ahead, despite the misgivings of the club&apos;s current owners. &quot;We don&apos;t know why they [the Gold brothers and David Sullivan] are being so negative,&quot; said Sammy Yu, who might want to ask his boss why he hasn&apos;t contacted the club since October 27 and made no public effort to keep Bernard Cribbins as Bongo manager. Real Betis have sacked coach Hector Cuper, after yesterday&apos;s 2-0 defeat to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid left the club second from bottom in the Primera Division. &quot;Cuper has proven himself to be a gentleman throughout his time at the head of the team,&quot; read a club statement, as Cuper pitched up to the local Jobcentre in a top hat and monocle. &quot;It is the results that have been the reason for his departure.&quot; Spurs think Robbie Keane&apos;s ridiculously harsh red card yesterday was ridiculously harsh and will appeal. &quot;I&apos;m convinced it was not a red card,&quot; said Spurs assistant boss Gus Poyet. &quot;We know the referee asked the fourth official for his view but he was only a few yards from the ball.&quot; And 40 Warley Sunday League referees went on strike in the West Midlands at the weekend over the amount of foul and abusive language they have to put up with.

The role of forests and carbon markets and the need to finance a transfer of clean and green technology from the north to the south are also high on the agenda. If governments rise to their responsibilities, vulnerable communities from Bangladesh to Barbados will have cause to celebrate. It will also mean a transition to a low-carbon society, new industries and a different way of doing business on this planet, and that means jobs. The employment potential of combating climate change and of climate-proofing economies is only now coming to the fore. These are jobs not for just the middle classes, but also in a range of work from construction and agriculture to engineering and transport. A study by the US-based Management Information Services estimated that in 2005 the environmental industry in the US generated more than 5.3m jobs, over $340bn (\u00a3165bn) in sales and $47bn in tax revenue, and employed 10 times more workers than the pharmaceutical industry. In June this year, Eaga, which improves the energy efficiency of UK homes, floated on the London stock exchange. It employs 4,000 people in one of the UK&apos;s former coal-mining regions.  A new report by the UN Environment Programme&apos;s (Unep) sustainable energy finance initiative estimates that investment in renewables has reached $100bn, and now represents 18% of new investments in the power sector.  Hansen, a wind power gearbox maker owned by the Indian company Suzlon, has just built a factory in Tianjin, China, which will employ 600 people, and is building another in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, which will employ 800. New Delhi is introducing new eco-friendly compressed natural gas buses, which will create 18,000 jobs.  Direct employment in tourism in Kenya - mainly based on wildlife, national parks and landscapes - is about 200,000. The wider impact on the economy and employment is estimated to be far greater.  About 80% of young people questioned for a new survey in the US were interested in jobs that had a positive impact on the environment, and more than 90% said they would choose to work for environmentally friendly and socially responsible firms. A survey of workers in Brazil, China, Germany, India, the UK and the US found that employees who perceived their companies as socially responsible were happier and more likely to stay.  Roland Berger, a consultancy in Munich, estimates that in Germany in 2020 more people will be employed in environmental technology industries than in the car industry. Working Capital, a financial report from Unep, says the market providing finance for clean and renewable energy could reach $1.9 trillion by 2020.  A report by one of the world&apos;s largest law firm concludes that, in key cases, the investment community has the legal responsibility to incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into investment decisions, and a Unep meeting this year in Brazil concluded that both institutional investors and &quot;high net-worth individuals&quot; were progressively realising the importance of ESG-inclusion in long-term investment.  Kyoto&apos;s clean development mechanism could send $100bn from north to south for investment in carbon offsetting projects, such as renewable energy schemes and tree planting. An alliance of tropical forest countries is pressing for standing forests to be included in the carbon markets, which could generate jobs in conservation and tourism, and several countries, including Costa Rica, Norway and New Zealand, have pledged carbon neutrality, which will create more jobs.  In the wider landscape, more creative market mechanisms are emerging, such as payment for ecosystem services: power companies with hydroelectric stations are paying farmers and communities to maintain forests and soil upstream in Costa Rica and Kenya, for example. With debt-for-nature swaps, countries have some debts cancelled, and some of the savings are invested in conservation and the rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems. More than 20 states and some 300 cities in the US have adopted renewable energy standards and/or emission reduction targets in line with the Kyoto protocol.  Last week, the National Development and Reform Commission and the commerce ministry in China announced bans and restrictions on foreign investment in mining and some energy sectors.  In a recent report, US economist Roger Bezdek concluded that, with the right government incentives and investment in research and development, renewable energy and energy-efficiency industries could create 40m jobs in the US by 2030.  Clearly, we stand on the edge of something quite exciting and transformational.

Tens of thousands of people in yellow shirts and waving yellow flags - the colour symbolises devotion to the monarch - packed the streets around the grand palace in Bangkok, where Bhumibol made a rare public appearance from the balcony of his ceremonial throne hall. Bhumibol&apos;s birthday has increasingly become a day of nationwide tribute to the man who is regarded as the most influential figure in modern Thai history, and the key to the country&apos;s stability. This year&apos;s celebration was clouded by nationwide anxiety over Bhumibol&apos;s declining health, concerns about his eventual successor, and a chaotic political situation ahead of divisive elections later this month. &quot;I am glad that everyone has come together in unison to give me birthday wishes,&quot; he told the crowd, seated on a golden throne and dressed in a gold brocade robe. The comments echoed his traditional televised birthday speech the night before, when Bhumibol repeatedly called for national unity. He likened the country&apos;s situation to difficulties he has walking. Bhumibol was recently hospitalised for three weeks for symptoms of a stroke, the latest of many ailments, and now moves about with a walker. &quot;[We] must be united, like our legs must be united - which means one goes forward and one pushes back before moving forward,&quot; he said. &quot;This way, we could walk without falling. Without unity, the country will face disaster.&quot; Bhumibol was born in 1927, in Massachusetts, where his father, Prince Mahidol, was studying medicine at Harvard university. He was 19 when he became the ninth king of Thailand&apos;s Chakri dynasty on June 9 1946, after his older brother Ananda died from a mysterious gunshot to the head. Though he is a constitutional king with no formal political role, he is regarded as key to holding the country together. Bhumibol has quelled bloody uprisings, weathered military coups and reigned through scores of governments, democratic and dictatorial. In his six decades on the throne, he has taken an active role in rural development and is respected for his dedication to helping the country&apos;s poor. Bhumibol has never publicly commented on his successor, an issue that weighs heavily on Thai minds even if it is rarely discussed in public. His son, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, has been groomed to succeed him. But the 55-year-old prince lacks the stature and popularity of his father. There is also concern that Vajiralongkorn, who has married three times, fathered six children and for years had the reputation of a ladies&apos; man, will have difficulty living up to Bhumibol&apos;s record of hard work and diligence. The December 23 election will be the first since a September 2006 coup toppled the elected government of the former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, whom the king had criticised in previous birthday speeches.", "publicationDate": "2007-12-05T14:05:44Z", "tags": ["World news", "Thailand", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/05/thailand", "title": "Thais wear yellow to mark monarch's 80th year", "sentences": ["Tens of thousands of people in yellow shirts and waving yellow flags - the colour symbolises devotion to the monarch - packed the streets around the grand palace in Bangkok, where Bhumibol made a rare public appearance from the balcony of his ceremonial throne hall."]}, {"article": "The world&apos;s longest-serving monarch, Thailand&apos;s King Bhumibol Adulyadej, celebrated his 80th birthday yesterday amid a national outpouring of joy and devotion for the man who has steered the country through many difficult times. Tens of thousands of Thais, who revere the king as semi-divine, turned Bangkok into a sea of yellow, wearing bright T-shirts in the colour associated with the day of his birth in 1927 and waving flags and banners in the nation&apos;s capital. Support for the king, which borders on the fanatical, has grown steadily since he ascended the throne 61 years ago. The uncertainty spurred by last year&apos;s coup and the general election later this month has further heightened Thais&apos; hopes for the longevity of the man viewed as a steadying influence. Concerns over the health of the frail king, stiff and unsmiling in public, have grown since he recently spent three weeks in hospital undergoing treatment for the symptoms of a stroke, forcing him to use a walking stick. The anxiety over his health is bound up with apprehension over the succession. The presumed heir, 55-year-old Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, has inspired little confidence among many Thais that he will be able to match his father&apos;s steady hand.

Better seize the opportunity to stay at these intimate hotels before Bangkok comes to its senses and replaces them with mammoth towers.   1. Baan Chantra  A short walk from the tourist ghetto of Khao San Road, Baan Chantra might be marketed as a boutique hotel but it is really a more mature version of the area&apos;s famous guesthouses. The converted 1930s shophouse retains its original teak interiors with an informal atmosphere, perfect for folks who prefer the backpacker ideal of staying close to the local community but who also need some of life&apos;s mod cons. The hotel&apos;s four rooms range from standard, which is comfortable but modest, to deluxe, which is a slightly more boastful designation for a bigger room with an attached sun deck.  \u00b7 120 Samsen Road, Banglamphu; + 66 2628 6988; double 2,400THB (\u00a339) 2. Phranakorn Norn Len A guesthouse with style, Phranakorn Norn Len has an arty thrift-store aesthetic. The simple rooms are transformed from basic flops to quirky abodes with hand-painted floral wall patterns, hanging plants and quilted throw pillows. The shady garden and courtyard help promote the hotel&apos;s guiding principle for a stress free stay and the guests seem to truly appreciate the gesture. This do-good code infuses the morning meals, which are vegetarian and use locally grown ingredients.  \u00b7 46 Soi Thewet 1, Krung Kasem Road; + 66 2628-8188; double 2,200THB (\u00a336) 3. Old Bangkok Inn  A charming nod to the past, Old Bangkok Inn occupies the antique district once home to minor Siamese royalty and epitomises the city&apos;s revival of classically minded hotels. The 10 rooms, including lofts and suites, are individually decorated in Thai floral themes that evoke a romantic ambience, although the square footage is a little meager. The hotel goes beyond style with many eco-friendly measures, including solar water heating and energy efficient appliances.  \u00b7 609 Phra Sumen Road, Banglamphu; + 66 2629 1785; double 3,700THB (\u00a360) 4. Arun Residence       Until recently, Bangkok&apos;s most historic district of Ko Ratanakosin, filled with palaces and temples, closed down after dark. But this riverside inn, occupying an old Sino-Portuguese-style building, now provides a place to bed among nighttime vistas of the temple spires. Arun Residence bears simple but elegant period d\u00e9cor in its five rooms, mostly split-level lofts. The Arun suite has a private balcony with views of monumental Wat Arun. \u00b7 36-38 Soi Pratu Nok Yoong, Maharat Road, Ko Ratanakosin; + 66 2221 9158; double 3,100THB (\u00a350) 5. Ibrik Resort by the River Barely big enough to be called an &quot;inn&quot;, Ibrik feels more like a private residence with only three guest rooms and a non-commercial location in Thonburi, across the river from Bangkok. A small, understated sign marks the entrance from the pedestrian lane that winds past a local market, a renowned theatre school and a neighbourhood temple. The interior is crisp and modern and the River Room has a big picture window drinking in the adjacent Chao Phraya River (although the river traffic is as noisy as it is picturesque).  \u00b7 256 Soi Wat Rakang, Arunamrin Road, Thonburi; + 66 2848 9220; double 4,000THB (\u00a365) 6. Chakrabongse Villas  The Thai king may never offer you a spare room during your stay in the kingdom, but you can bunk like a royal at this former palace, just a brief stroll from the historic sites of Ko Ratanakosin. The riverside estate dates to 1908 when it was used for overnight visits by the 40th son of King Chulalongkorn. Today, three traditional-style apartments occupy the lush garden, soaking in private views of the river; the interiors boast rich hues of gleaming teak and earth-toned silks.  \u00b7 396 Maharat Road, Ko Ratanakosin; + 66 2622 3356;; double 10,000THB (\u00a3163) 7. Shanghai Inn  Although Chinatown is one of Bangkok&apos;s more intriguing neighbourhoods, the sleeping options are monopolised by hulking matrons dating from the gaudy days of pink vinyl and shag carpet. This hip hotel breaks the mould with retro Chinoiserie stylings. Pink and purple lanterns, bamboo floors and imperial-inspired furniture transform the hotel&apos;s 55 rooms into boudoirs evoking jazz-era Shanghai. \u00b7 479 Yaowarat Road, Chinatown; + 66 2221 2121; double 2,800THB (\u00a346) 8. La Residence Hotel  One of the city&apos;s first &quot;boutique&quot; hotels, La Residence is a petite player amid the high-rises of Bangkok&apos;s financial district. Each of the 26 rooms is individually decorated but without excessive fussiness or pretension. The staff are accessible and helpful with recommendations and general know-how. The drawback is that the location is a little lacklustre, surrounded by the ageing commercial buildings of Surawong Road. Despite this, it is just a short walk to Patpong and a Skytrain station, and slightly further to the riverside luxury hotels.  \u00b7 173/8-9 Surawong Road, Bangrak; + 66 2233 3301; double 2,000THB (\u00a333) 9. Eugenia       Now that travel is no longer an aristocratic sport, it is rare to find a new hotel that has modelled itself after the steamship-era grand dames. But this 19th-century manor house prefers a simplified Victorian sensibility to the prevailing club Zen look of modern hotels. The 12 sumptuous suites are decorated with canopy beds (and starched Belgian linens), hand-hammered tubs, and antique fixtures collected by the owners. Sip a draft of sophistication beside the pool or in the hunting lodge library. To complete the privileged fantasy, hire one of the hotel&apos;s chauffeured vintage Jaguars for the trip from the airport. \u00b7 Soi 31, Sukhumvit Road; + 66 2259 9017; double 5,800THB (\u00a394) 10.

Chalerm Yoobamrung, a parliamentary candidate of the People Power party (PPP), made the announcement at a campaign rally ahead of Sunday&apos;s general election, which will restore the country to democracy. The PPP is led by Thaksin&apos;s loyalists who regrouped after his Thai Rak Thai party was disbanded by court order earlier this year. Chalerm said Thaksin, who was abroad at the time of the September 2006 coup, had informed him in a phone call last night that he would return on February 14. The 58-year-old billionaire tycoon, who bought Manchester City football club while in exile, will be following Sunday&apos;s proceedings from Hong Kong. Even before today&apos;s announcement, the former prime minister had cast a long shadow over the contest. Thaksin&apos;s \u00a381.6m buy-up of the Premier League club has kept him in the spotlight among football-mad Thais, and last month&apos;s high-profile purchase of three Thai footballers - with manager Sven-Goran Eriksson rubber-stamping the deal in Bangkok - had a whiff of politicking about it. Political rivals in the Democrat party, which is in a neck-and-neck race with the PPP, have wrongly suggested the trio will take the field against Aston Villa tomorrow to drive home the point. However, transfer rules prevent them from playing until the new year. Still, their fears emphasise Thaksin&apos;s enduring potency. Voters in Thailand&apos;s poor north and north-east - strongholds of Thaksin and the Thai Rak Thai - appear set to back the PPP, which assumed much of its predecessors&apos; populist platform and many of its personnel. Polls in Thailand suggest the PPP, led by the veteran right-winger Samak Sundaravej, could become the biggest party and may even win an outright majority. A clear PPP victory would pose a headache for the junta. The coup&apos;s naked aim was to get Thaksin out, and corruption allegations - which have made little headway - were supposed to keep him out. But Samak has pledged to allow Thaksin to return to clear his name. Sunai Thasuk, of Human Rights Watch, believes army surveillance, tantamount to harassment in PPP strongholds, shows the junta has set its face against a PPP victory, which could spawn trouble. &quot;If the PPP wins and the junta refuses to recognise the voters&apos; will - either using the election commission or some other dirty tricks - then they would naturally be upset,&quot; he said. &quot;There&apos;s bound to be some reaction. That would put Thailand in a very, very dangerous position.&quot; Should the PPP come out on top but fail to secure a majority, analysts believe the military will exert pressure on smaller parties to join a Democrat coalition led by the Eton and Oxford-educated 43-year-old Abhisit Vajjajiva, a suave figure favoured by Bangkok&apos;s urban elite. &quot;We&apos;re not going to have certainty after the election,&quot; said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, the director of Chulalongkorn University&apos;s Institute of Security and International Studies. &quot;We have deep-seated polarisation in the electorate that will only by magnified by the election results.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-12-21T15:24:55Z", "tags": ["World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/21/ianmackinnon.haroonsiddique", "title": "Thaksin to end Thai exile in February, says ally", "sentences": ["Thaksin&apos;s \u00a381.6m buy-up of the Premier League club has kept him in the spotlight among football-mad Thais, and last month&apos;s high-profile purchase of three Thai footballers - with manager Sven-Goran Eriksson rubber-stamping the deal in Bangkok - had a whiff of politicking about it.", "That would put Thailand in a very, very dangerous position.&quot; Should the PPP come out on top but fail to secure a majority, analysts believe the military will exert pressure on smaller parties to join a Democrat coalition led by the Eton and Oxford-educated 43-year-old Abhisit Vajjajiva, a suave figure favoured by Bangkok&apos;s urban elite."]}, {"article": "Fifteen months after the bloodless coup that unseated prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, Thailand will go to the polls again tomorrow to restore the democracy taken by the generals.

An Irish colleague and I had been trying for at least a month to convince our boss that we had to have a staff Christmas party. &apos;But we are going to have one,&apos; she kept insisting. &apos;The chairman will give his speech and then there will be a glass of champagne!&apos; &apos;No,&apos; we said, &apos;a party.&apos; Finally, we obtained a promise that our team - a dozen of us - would go out for lunch on the Friday before Christmas. We had several argumentative meetings, and eventually settled on a venue that left only six of our French colleagues whingeing. We had chosen a Swiss fondue place, which had a snowy, almost Christmassy feel about it. The wine flowed (especially into the two English-speaking mouths), people who hated each other managed to smile, and everything was going swimmingly until coffee. &apos;OK, back to work everyone,&apos; the boss announced. &apos;It&apos;s three o&apos;clock.&apos; Uh? Didn&apos;t she realise that the party wasn&apos;t supposed to end until we&apos;d all made total idiots of ourselves and thereby galvanized our team spirit? Clearly not. We trooped solemnly back to our desks, only two of us stumbling and slurring more than usual. You see, Parisians just don&apos;t understand the need to get hammered and photocopy your backside. For them, Christmas, like the rest of life, is a much more classy affair. Admittedly, they do share our frenzied consumerism. In the week before Christmas, the department stores resemble the riots in the Paris suburbs. Parisians are famous for their sharp elbows, and even the poshest woman will resort to violence rather than allow you to grab the last bottle of Lacoste apres-rasage. On the narrow pavements of the rue de Rivoli, shopping bags turn into battering rams in the last-minute rush. Food is, of course, on everyone&apos;s shopping list. The big seasonal delicacy is foie gras which, let&apos;s not forget, translates as &apos;fat liver&apos;. Magazines run adverts encouraging people to buy their foie gras cheap by mail order. I hardly dare imagine the consequences of a seasonal postal strike - sorting offices full of rotting goose products. Yummy! Parisians also love their buche de Noel - chocolate log - a roly-poly sponge cake covered in soft icing. They are as exciting to eat as lengths of balsa wood, but I&apos;ve never managed to convince a Parisian that our spicy, alcohol-laced Christmas cakes and puddings are tastier. Mainly because the French believe that we make our pudding out of sugar-soaked turnips and bury it in the garden for six months to mature. Which about sums up their view of English food in general. Just once, some Parisian friends promised me a Christmas pudding. I waited with nostalgically watering mouth for everyone to finish their foie gras and stuffed turkey and then, sure enough, the hostess walked in with a real Christmas pud. She plonked it on the table and started to hack at it with a carving knife. I felt obliged to inform her that it might have been easier to slice if she&apos;d actually cooked it first. This got me nowhere: when I translated the cooking instructions (that she hadn&apos;t bothered to read, deeming that no British dish could be too complicated for a Parisienne to understand), she declared that anything that needed boiling for two hours, or microwaving till the oven threatens to explode, was sure to be inedible, and went to get a more civilised dessert. And after her buche, I couldn&apos;t spend the afternoon digesting the feast in front of a Bond film, because it was midnight - the French usually celebrate Christmas on the evening of 24 December. My favourite place to spend Christmas Eve is La Coupole, the giant brasserie near Montparnasse. You sip champagne at the bar, then go and eat a mound of oysters while slick (but very polite) waiters fuss around, and conversation bubbles happily amid the art deco murals. It&apos;s Paris at its most suave, and costs zilch compared with its London equivalent. After this, Christmas Day itself has a zombie-like quality. You see Parisians rushing about, loaded with presents, on their way to have lunch with the in-laws. Parents are bad-tempered because they over-indulged last night and are suffering from indigestion, which they dramatise as a crise de foie, or &apos;liver crisis&apos;. Kids just want to stay at home and play with their new games console. And then on Boxing Day, for those who aren&apos;t skiing, it&apos;s back to work. There are no football matches, because the French league operates a mid-season &apos;truce&apos; so that players don&apos;t get cold knees. There aren&apos;t even any sales, because French shopkeepers postpone those till the middle of January, presumably because they hope that people will return to the shops on 26 December and pay full whack for the things they really wanted for Christmas. Meanwhile, in the office, an email comes round from human resources telling everyone to brace themselves for the excitement of 6 January, when the galette des rois (a traditional marzipan-stuffed pastry) will be served in the canteen, accompanied by a glass of champagne and a new year speech from the chairman.

His latest novel is &apos;Merde Happens&apos; (Bantam Press, \u00a310.99). Venice, Italy In Venice, the big celebration is on the Vigilia di Natale - Christmas Eve. Although most people should be at work, most offices shut towards the end of the morning, and everyone concentrates on shopping for dinner and last-minute presents.  By lunchtime the bars and cafes along the Misericordia canal will be teeming, but it is only on the main drag - Strada Nova, which leads all the way to the Rialto Bridge - that the mood is really Christmassy. The street is taken over by the scores of colourful stalls that make up the Mercatino di Natale. There are half a dozen of these traditional Christmas markets in Venice, selling bargain-price presents from chic leather bags to fashionable shoes.  Soon everyone throngs towards the Rialto food market on the other side of the Grand Canal. To avoid the tourists jammed on the vaporetto, pay 50 cents to cross on the public gondola service, the traghetto, which moors outside the pescheria, the fishmonger section of the market. This is where the crowds are, because the traditional Christmas Eve dinner is based totally on fish .  So while the butchers are almost deserted, the pescheria stalls are piled high with freshly caught sea bass, bream, john dory, monkfish, turbot, sole and cases of wriggling eels. Die-hard locals will insist on the most traditional Christmas Eve dish, bisato su l&apos;ara. This is a centuries-old recipe for roast eel, originally cooked in the ara, the red-hot oven of Murano glass blowers. Tradition says a 16th-century Doge, Andrea Gritti, ate so much eel he died of indigestion.  Nowadays, though, you are as likely to be served a delicious turbot slowly cooked on a bed of thinly sliced potatoes, or a whole sea bass baked in rock salt.  With the shopping done, it&apos;s off to one of the dozens of osterie around the market, to get into the Christmas mood with glasses of prosecco before heading home to prepare the evening meal. Although most Venetian restaurants are open for lavish Christmas Eve dinners, the clientele is almost exclusively visitors, because Venetians spend the Vigilia at home. I&apos;m invited every year by my Venetian friends, Alberto and Anna, to join their celebrations. Dinner starts at 8pm with yet more prosecco. Dinner is a long, lazy affair, but light compared with back home, and everyone looks confused when I try to explain about crackers. The menu runs to creamy baccala (salt cod), fish broth, wild mushroom risotto, then fish. For dessert, a huge pandoro (golden bread) is unwrapped, grappa bottles appear, and as midnight strikes, the present-opening begins.  Midnight Mass in Saint Mark&apos;s is an unforgettable experience, but usually attended by tourists; Venetians prefer to walk to their local church. And kids here don&apos;t hang out stockings or expect Babbo Natale, (Father Christmas) to leave presents: that happens on the Epiphany, 12 days after Christmas, when Santa is replaced by the Befana, a wicked witch who flies in on a broomstick.John Brunton \u00b7 John Brunton is a journalist and photographer who lives in Venice and Paris. Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo Our festivities start on Christmas Eve. I go to the local church early in the day with other neighbours to help decorate it. Then all the family get together, dressed up in their best clothes, and at 10pm we walk back to the church, where we will stay, singing and dancing, until 6am the next day.  The church will be full of people of all ages. A choir sings; the pastor gives a sermon in either in French or Lingala, depending how well he speaks either language; adults and children act out the nativity; and we give thanks to God for looking after us to the end of another year. People give their own testimonies; we sing hymns (mostly Congolese ones); there is drumming and a synthesiser; people blow whistles and cry out with joy and we dance all night. The atmosphere is really joyous! When we get home, I feel so great that I don&apos;t go to bed. I just start preparing the meal. Everyone tries to make sure they have a chicken for Christmas dinner, but some years, when I didn&apos;t have work, we just had rice and pondu (a basic Congolese dish made from wild spinach and peanuts).  The electricity supply is often down here, but on Christmas Day the electricity company usually makes an effort. I do some cooking ahead just in case. If you really get stuck without electricity you can hire a generator for the day for between $30 and $50 - but that&apos;s a lot of money.  I have a tap in my house, but sometimes the water supply is also cut. When our reserve supply runs out we have to fetch water, carrying it in tubs on our heads. With my cousins, sisters and daughters I prepare the Christmas dinner. I roast the chicken, make a special cabbage salad and prepare the salt fish. I make a cake for dessert but that&apos;s my choice - some people have biscuits, or other things.  Last year, I had around 20 people to feed, and I also made plates of food for neighbours who don&apos;t have the means to do their own dinner. We might have a bottle of red wine and perhaps some sangria and sucres (fizzy drinks), but no one gets drunk.  After dinner there is a present for each of my children, but they don&apos;t make a fuss if there are none. They know some children don&apos;t know what it is to ever get a present. During Christmas we play music. I like to put on hymns but the children soon change that to things they like, even some Western music - Shakira, things like that. In the evening the young men will often go out to a bistro. I won&apos;t allow my girls out as there are always lots of pregnancies from that night of partying, drinking and disorder. This year my big worry is the rain. It usually rains here on Christmas Day, as it is the middle of the rainy season. When it rains, water floods into my house and even comes up through the tiles in the floor around my bed, bringing in dirt from outside. I want to move house. Recently, I had to sleep in a plastic chair and the children had to sleep on a mattress in the kitchen to stay dry. My favourite part of Christmas is for everyone to be together. Being with my children and the rest of my family and eating together - that&apos;s what makes me feel good.Sophie Kasengela \u00b7 Sophie Kasengela, 44, is a mother of five and works as a housekeeper. Moscow, Russia There are not, if I&apos;m honest, many advantages to winter in Moscow. Apart from one: you are guaranteed snow, lots of it. Last month, we tested our sledging gear for the first time. On Christmas Day we plan to return to the park just behind our Moscow flat. Here, there is a terrific gully - our kids, Tilly, 10, and Ruskin, seven, have discovered their favourite whooshing spot, underneath the silver birch trees. I too am partial to a bit of whizzing; my wife, Phoebe, however, thinks I&apos;m a middle-aged oaf-person.  After this, the plan is to return home for the obligatory present-fest and then round off Christmas Day with an episode or two of Doctor Who. (We are still on the series with Christopher Ecclestone and Billie Piper -being behind the times is one of the drawbacks of expat life.)  The major difference between Russia and Britain is that Christmas in Russia isn&apos;t Christmas. In Russia 25 December is a working day. Commuters commute, trolleybuses trolley, and even Vladimir Putin doesn&apos;t get a day off. Russians celebrate Christmas 13 days later, on 7 January. (This is the date of Christ&apos;s birth according to the Julian calendar; Russia&apos;s orthodox church has always gone with the Julian date.) The confusion is also partly the fault of the god-hating Bolsheviks: up until 1917 Russians celebrated Christmas on 25 December like everyone else. The communists did their best to kill off Christmas and St Nicholas - renaming him Grandfather Frost. Instead, New Year became Russia&apos;s main winter festival. There are several important rituals around this time - one of which includes getting stuck in traffic. Going anywhere by car in Moscow is difficult. Just before New Year it&apos;s impossible: the number of vehicles goes up by 25 per cent as everyone buys presents. It&apos;s generally quicker to sledge. Russians begin partying big-time on New Year&apos;s Eve - embarking on a two-week orgy of drinking, flirting and work-dodging that stretches into the middle of January.  Present-swapping takes place on New Year&apos;s Eve. It&apos;s traditional also to pop bottles of Russian-made &apos;Sovietsky&apos; champagne at midnight. Since the fall of communism, Christmas on 7 January has enjoyed a minor comeback. Religious Russians go to church; everyone else simply enjoys the day off. There is also fortune-telling and boot-throwing. (Unmarried girls throw boots over their shoulder. Where the boot lands will, so it is said, point them in the direction of their future husbands.) As for us - we&apos;ll be in Bangkok. Hurrah! There&apos;s only so much snow a family can take, after all. Luke Harding \u00b7 Luke Harding is The Observer&apos;s Moscow correspondent. Rothera Research Station, Antarctica If there&apos;s one place in the world where you are guaranteed a white Christmas, it&apos;s surely Antarctica. With the frozen continent holding some 90 per cent of the world&apos;s ice, there is no shortage of white stuff to get you into that festive spirit. But strangely enough, that is probably as Christmassy as it gets. Having daylight for 24 hours brings a summery rather than an early-nights-and-log-fires feel to the place. And without the now-obligatory November Christmas tree and shops bursting at the seams, the carefully crafted expectation is not built up as it is back home. Indeed, a far bigger celebration here is midwinter, in June, which marks the darkest day of the year and the meridian of the long isolated winter for all those fortunate enough to call Antarctica their (albeit temporary) home. I live in Rothera Research Station, the largest of the British Antarctic Survey&apos;s research stations, on the Antarctic Peninsula. It is a collection of relatively small buildings perched on a promontory over a bay filled with icebergs, whales, seals and penguins. The nearest human habitation is 100 miles away, and even that is another research station. It is a beautiful, majestic land of glittering ice and unspoilt wilderness unexploited by man - promising adventure and commanding awe in all who behold it. Christmas Day itself still has many of the features to which we have all grown accustomed back in the UK. Our two chefs will be working hard ahead of time to prepare four turkeys to fill a hundred hungry mouths, supplemented by pigs-in-a-blanket, stuffing, bread sauce, cranberry sauce, Brussels sprouts, mince pies and my personal favourite, Christmas pudding. Ahead of time (but possibly only just), parts of the main building with be dressed in shining stars and twinkling tinsel. The dining room will be the main focus of our decorative efforts, and will house our two Christmas trees. When 25 December itself comes we will all enjoy a day off work, making the most of the opportunity to take our time eating that gargantuan meal all together. The people here have become friends, and for those of us now approaching our second winter on base, this is very much our proxy family. Inevitably many will miss those sitting 10,000 miles away in the UK, but there is no shortage of friends here. For the rest of the day, though, the contrasts with the British Christmas are apparent. The Christmas film may be enjoyed by some, but for others, myself included, it will be usurped by a Christmas ski around the local area. The Queen&apos;s speech will probably be deposed by a speech from our base commander, or our oratorical French chef.  But while we were blessed with the ultimate excuse for not braving the high street scrum of Christmas consumerism (the shop here is pretty limited, I&apos;m afraid), those of us with friends and family who went to the shops for us, sometimes nearly five months in advance to allow for shipping time, will still have some presents to open. The question for me now is: where am I going to hang my stocking?Alistair Simpson \u00b7Dr Alistair Simpson is the 2007 wintering doctor at Rothera Research Station, looking after the health of the station staff and researching fitness and body composition. See antarctica.ac.uk Beijing, China In a country where religion is not promoted, Christmas in Beijing is reduced to its most self-indulgent basics: eating, drinking and being merry. You might say it has all the fun without any religious or familial guilt. Although the main festival is Chinese New Year [7 February in 2008] - when families get together and presents, often simply cash, are given - Christmas is quickly taking hold here. For many Beijingers the iconic image of Christmas - Santa, with his rotund girth and big grin - feels comfortingly similar to that of the fat laughing Buddha.  By the first week of December, Christmas fever has kicked in. Full-size Santas stand guard outside shops and galleries and the capital looks increasingly like a European city, with bright lights covering the trees and shopfronts, the occasional frosting of snow forcing people to wrap in long scarves, and even the whiff of chestnuts roasting on the street.  Beijingers love to spend, and any excuse to splash cash - on food and drink, gifts and cards - is embraced wholeheartedly. Parents who give traditional New Year gifts are now also lavishing their only children with chocolates and toys at Christmas, and the giving of small presents between school kids have become de rigueur. A few years ago, the best alternative to a Christmas tree was a vibrant pot plant, so I was surprised this year to find the streets surrounding the flower markets scattered with browning pine trees that quite clearly wouldn&apos;t survive till Christmas Eve. But with all the &apos;Made in China&apos; plastic trees, baubles and fairy lights costing practically nothing, it has been easy enough to make our flat look festive for just a few quid.  Christmas Day is a working day, but most expats make sure to take a few days&apos; annual leave so they can party the weekend before and stuff themselves silly on the big day while watching James Bond films bought for 50p from the knock-off DVD shop.  While many expats, and the newly wealthy Chinese, head to a five-star restaurant banquet on the 25th, this year we will have roast goose, home-made mince pies and a Christmas cake. At least it will make a change from duck.Tom Pattison  \u00b7 Tom Pattison is editor-in-chief of Time Out Beijing, published monthly in China. Delhi, India  In the days of British imperial India, homesick English families made laborious attempts to celebrate Christmas much as they would have done at home.  In the vice-regal lodge in Calcutta &apos;there was always a fancy dress ball and a children&apos;s party where Father Christmas entered on an elephant&apos;, Charles Allen writes in Plain Tales from the Raj. &apos;The British had their own rituals. The first was the arrival in September of the catalogue sent around in good time to enable customers to choose what they would like dispatched from London for Christmas,&apos; Allen continues. &apos;The Christmas dinner and the Christmas cake followed the familiar pattern, although peafowl - &quot;beautifully white flesh but very, very dry&quot; - frequently took the place of tinned turkey.&apos;  A century has passed, India&apos;s political and economic landscape has changed beyond recognition, and now it&apos;s as easy to hop on a British Airways flight home as it is to buy air-freighted cranberries in Delhi. But for those in the diplomatic community who are preparing gloomily to spend Christmas here, the same preoccupations remain.  India has 13 million Christians, but most live in the south. Although Christmas is a national public holiday, in Delhi, the days preceding 25 December have none of the excitement that marks the lead-up to Diwali, the Hindu festival of light celebrated earlier in the autumn.  As a result, American and European expatriates still go to great lengths to recreate the Christmas atmosphere. Instead of a mail-order catalogue, families living in the gated compounds of the British High Commission or the Canadian or US Embassies, fill in internet orders for their Christmas requirements at least six weeks ahead of time, to allow their consignments of mincemeat and bread sauce mix to be shipped over.  Those living outside the compounds have to rely on Delhi&apos;s famous French poultry farmer, a notoriously irascible man who has a small farm in an industrial suburb of Delhi. Sometimes he agrees to deliver turkey; sometimes - if you call at the wrong time, or sound too American - he declines. As a last resort, there is the stinking and unhygienic INA market, where large hens, slaughtered and plucked on the spot, provide a plausible alternative.  Across the city at Khan Market - a searingly expensive collection of shops frequented by Delhi&apos;s growing community of super-rich, as well as foreigners - inflatable Father Christmases obstruct the pavement, emitting tinny Chinese renditions of &apos;Santa Claus is Coming to Town&apos;. Shops offer hand-painted baubles with Christmas scenes of snow and fir trees, never witnessed by the people who made them.  Not everything is available. Despite the powerful forces of globalisation, which have brought Swarovski crystals and Marmite to a market which used to stock only local produce, Brussels sprouts remain unobtainable (to everyone&apos;s relief).  The children&apos;s party entertainment is unchanged. At this time of year, in the diplomatic enclave of New Delhi, a weary-looking elephant can occasionally be seen loping along the wide streets, led by a man in a peculiar, but just identifiable, Father Christmas outfit; the pair can be booked by the hour for party entertainment. In the evenings, a band of Salvation Army choristers, wearing pink Father Christmas masks so alarming they reduce children to tears, ring doorbells, singing Christmas carols in Hindi.  For a British community nostalgic for traditional festivities, there is the annual Christmas pantomime, put on by embassy volunteers and teachers from the British school. It&apos;s redolent of the amateur dramatics enjoyed by the ladies of the Raj during their summer retreat to the hill stations. Last year&apos;s Aladdin/A Lad in Delhi, had belly-dancing men in drag and cardboard rickshaws, and left everyone unfamiliar with the genre profoundly bemused.  Indian Christian families in Delhi do not share the British obsession with turkey or ritualised meals of pre-determined dishes. Families cook sweets such as gujia, sweet fried dough-balls flavoured with nuts and cardamom, which are also prepared for Hindu festivals like holi. Churches offer all-night mass, with services in Hindi and English.  But despite everyone&apos;s best efforts, it is impossible not to feel that Christmas here is a tame occasion in comparison with the wild abandon of Diwali, when so many fire crackers are let off that the city hangs heavy with smog for weeks.Amelia Gentleman Sydney, Australia After four cold, dark Christmases in the UK, I&apos;m back in Sydney this year, and everything is in place for a traditional Aussie Christmas.  Humidity is enveloping me like a blanket. The smell of jasmine dances on the warm afternoon breeze. The hum of cicadas drowns out conversation. And the tarmac squelches underfoot as I cross George Street to buy my first Christmas card - featuring Santa wearing boardshorts and driving a sleigh pulled by kangaroos. The grocers have started selling stone fruit, too. Unlike in the UK, where fruit and vegetables are jetted in from all over the world, fresh produce is still seasonal here.  The appearance of cherries, peaches and plums on the supermarket shelves is as good a sign as any that Santa is on his way. Indeed, the first box of cherries of the season is auctioned for charity. This year it fetched A$35,000 (\u00a315,000) for the Children&apos;s Hospital.  The English backpackers will spend Christmas on Bondi Beach, drinking beer, getting sunburnt and keeping the lifesavers busy. I&apos;ll be at home, sweltering through a full Christmas roast with all the trimmings. Christmas Eve is for having a few beers with mates, somewhere near a beach, preferably with a kilo or two of prawns. But on Christmas Day I&apos;ll sit down at the dinner table in the sweltering heat, apply the paper crown from my Christmas cracker to my sweaty forehead, and work my way through the turkey, the chicken, the pork and the ham that mum got up at dawn to prepare in a kitchen where the temperature is pushing 40C.  I&apos;ll finish the meal with the traditional Christmas pudding that we all had to stir when mum was making it. It&apos;ll be smothered in hot brandy custard and also peppered with A$2 coins that my mum presses into it as it is served. Boxing Day is traditionally a much less arduous affair. I&apos;ll spend the day in front of the telly watching the Boxing Day Test live from Melbourne. We&apos;re playing India this year, and while it will be great to see Sachin Tendulkar play in Oz for the last time, it won&apos;t be as sweet as last year, when we beat the English and Warnie got his 700th wicket.  I&apos;ll have a cold beer in my hand and there&apos;ll be a selection of cold cuts left over from Christmas dinner to gorge myself on. Sure, I&apos;ll be missing the EastEnders Christmas special. But I can always download that from the web.Peter Moore \u00b7 Peter Moore has written six travel narratives, including &apos;The Wrong Way Home&apos; and &apos;Vroom with a View&apos;. Visit his website at petermoore.net  Mexico City, Mexico If you&apos;re spending Christmas in Mexico, make sure you get yourself lots of bright red flowers - locals believe they can bring you good luck for the rest of the year. They take this superstition so seriously that they cover their homes with poinsettia - known in Mexico as the Christmas Flower - and the main streets and avenues become a sea of red.  In the Zocalo, Mexico City&apos;s huge main square, the world&apos;s largest ice-rink entertains young and old alike, while the city&apos;s many markets are busy with people searching for the perfect pine tree with which to decorate their home. Christmas carols here are played by mariachi, groups of street musicians. The biggest family dinner of the year is held on Christmas Eve. A traditional dinner would include turkey, but roast beef or pork are gradually becoming more common as a main dish. You can also have typical tamales, steam-cooked corn meal dough with a filling - and lots of hot spices, of course.  Every town in Mexico will hold a procession on the nine days before Christmas called a posada, a ceremony that symbolises the trials Mary and Joseph endured before finding a place for Jesus to be born. During the posadas people hang pinatas, large star-shaped containers made of papier mache and filled with toys and sweets, from trees or lampposts. Blindfolded children try to break them open with a stick, allowing the treats to pour out, to great excitement. And while children in the UK eagerly wait for Santa Claus to deliver gifts, Mexican kids must wait until 6 January, when the Three Kings, Los Reyes, arrive on horseback loaded with presents. In recent years children have also taken to writing to Santa - but rather than being posted to Lapland, the letters are hidden in the children&apos;s shoes.Javier Espinoza \u00b7 Javier Espinoza is a freelance journalist who was born in El Salvador and has travelled widely in Mexico, especially at Christmas.", "publicationDate": "2007-12-23T12:02:44Z", "tags": ["Travel", "Christmas", "Life and style"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/dec/23/christmas2007", "title": "Christmas around the world", "sentences": ["As for us - we&apos;ll be in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Paris, France I realised that the Parisians and the Brits don&apos;t see eye-to-eye about Christmas festivities round about 22 December in my first year working for a French company. An Irish colleague and I had been trying for at least a month to convince our boss that we had to have a staff Christmas party. &apos;But we are going to have one,&apos; she kept insisting. &apos;The chairman will give his speech and then there will be a glass of champagne!&apos; &apos;No,&apos; we said, &apos;a party.&apos; Finally, we obtained a promise that our team - a dozen of us - would go out for lunch on the Friday before Christmas. We had several argumentative meetings, and eventually settled on a venue that left only six of our French colleagues whingeing. We had chosen a Swiss fondue place, which had a snowy, almost Christmassy feel about it. The wine flowed (especially into the two English-speaking mouths), people who hated each other managed to smile, and everything was going swimmingly until coffee. &apos;OK, back to work everyone,&apos; the boss announced. &apos;It&apos;s three o&apos;clock.&apos; Uh? Didn&apos;t she realise that the party wasn&apos;t supposed to end until we&apos;d all made total idiots of ourselves and thereby galvanized our team spirit? Clearly not. We trooped solemnly back to our desks, only two of us stumbling and slurring more than usual. You see, Parisians just don&apos;t understand the need to get hammered and photocopy your backside. For them, Christmas, like the rest of life, is a much more classy affair. Admittedly, they do share our frenzied consumerism. In the week before Christmas, the department stores resemble the riots in the Paris suburbs. Parisians are famous for their sharp elbows, and even the poshest woman will resort to violence rather than allow you to grab the last bottle of Lacoste apres-rasage. On the narrow pavements of the rue de Rivoli, shopping bags turn into battering rams in the last-minute rush. Food is, of course, on everyone&apos;s shopping list. The big seasonal delicacy is foie gras which, let&apos;s not forget, translates as &apos;fat liver&apos;. Magazines run adverts encouraging people to buy their foie gras cheap by mail order. I hardly dare imagine the consequences of a seasonal postal strike - sorting offices full of rotting goose products. Yummy! Parisians also love their buche de Noel - chocolate log - a roly-poly sponge cake covered in soft icing. They are as exciting to eat as lengths of balsa wood, but I&apos;ve never managed to convince a Parisian that our spicy, alcohol-laced Christmas cakes and puddings are tastier. Mainly because the French believe that we make our pudding out of sugar-soaked turnips and bury it in the garden for six months to mature. Which about sums up their view of English food in general. Just once, some Parisian friends promised me a Christmas pudding. I waited with nostalgically watering mouth for everyone to finish their foie gras and stuffed turkey and then, sure enough, the hostess walked in with a real Christmas pud. She plonked it on the table and started to hack at it with a carving knife. I felt obliged to inform her that it might have been easier to slice if she&apos;d actually cooked it first. This got me nowhere: when I translated the cooking instructions (that she hadn&apos;t bothered to read, deeming that no British dish could be too complicated for a Parisienne to understand), she declared that anything that needed boiling for two hours, or microwaving till the oven threatens to explode, was sure to be inedible, and went to get a more civilised dessert. And after her buche, I couldn&apos;t spend the afternoon digesting the feast in front of a Bond film, because it was midnight - the French usually celebrate Christmas on the evening of 24 December. My favourite place to spend Christmas Eve is La Coupole, the giant brasserie near Montparnasse. You sip champagne at the bar, then go and eat a mound of oysters while slick (but very polite) waiters fuss around, and conversation bubbles happily amid the art deco murals. It&apos;s Paris at its most suave, and costs zilch compared with its London equivalent. After this, Christmas Day itself has a zombie-like quality. You see Parisians rushing about, loaded with presents, on their way to have lunch with the in-laws. Parents are bad-tempered because they over-indulged last night and are suffering from indigestion, which they dramatise as a crise de foie, or &apos;liver crisis&apos;. Kids just want to stay at home and play with their new games console. And then on Boxing Day, for those who aren&apos;t skiing, it&apos;s back to work. There are no football matches, because the French league operates a mid-season &apos;truce&apos; so that players don&apos;t get cold knees. There aren&apos;t even any sales, because French shopkeepers postpone those till the middle of January, presumably because they hope that people will return to the shops on 26 December and pay full whack for the things they really wanted for Christmas. Meanwhile, in the office, an email comes round from human resources telling everyone to brace themselves for the excitement of 6 January, when the galette des rois (a traditional marzipan-stuffed pastry) will be served in the canteen, accompanied by a glass of champagne and a new year speech from the chairman. Party time!Stephen Clarke \u00b7 Stephen Clarke&apos;s book &apos;Talk to the Snail - Ten Commandments for Understanding the French&apos;, is published by Black Swan at \u00a36.99). His latest novel is &apos;Merde Happens&apos; (Bantam Press, \u00a310.99). Venice, Italy In Venice, the big celebration is on the Vigilia di Natale - Christmas Eve. Although most people should be at work, most offices shut towards the end of the morning, and everyone concentrates on shopping for dinner and last-minute presents.  By lunchtime the bars and cafes along the Misericordia canal will be teeming, but it is only on the main drag - Strada Nova, which leads all the way to the Rialto Bridge - that the mood is really Christmassy. The street is taken over by the scores of colourful stalls that make up the Mercatino di Natale. There are half a dozen of these traditional Christmas markets in Venice, selling bargain-price presents from chic leather bags to fashionable shoes.  Soon everyone throngs towards the Rialto food market on the other side of the Grand Canal. To avoid the tourists jammed on the vaporetto, pay 50 cents to cross on the public gondola service, the traghetto, which moors outside the pescheria, the fishmonger section of the market. This is where the crowds are, because the traditional Christmas Eve dinner is based totally on fish .  So while the butchers are almost deserted, the pescheria stalls are piled high with freshly caught sea bass, bream, john dory, monkfish, turbot, sole and cases of wriggling eels. Die-hard locals will insist on the most traditional Christmas Eve dish, bisato su l&apos;ara. This is a centuries-old recipe for roast eel, originally cooked in the ara, the red-hot oven of Murano glass blowers. Tradition says a 16th-century Doge, Andrea Gritti, ate so much eel he died of indigestion.  Nowadays, though, you are as likely to be served a delicious turbot slowly cooked on a bed of thinly sliced potatoes, or a whole sea bass baked in rock salt.  With the shopping done, it&apos;s off to one of the dozens of osterie around the market, to get into the Christmas mood with glasses of prosecco before heading home to prepare the evening meal. Although most Venetian restaurants are open for lavish Christmas Eve dinners, the clientele is almost exclusively visitors, because Venetians spend the Vigilia at home. I&apos;m invited every year by my Venetian friends, Alberto and Anna, to join their celebrations. Dinner starts at 8pm with yet more prosecco. Dinner is a long, lazy affair, but light compared with back home, and everyone looks confused when I try to explain about crackers. The menu runs to creamy baccala (salt cod), fish broth, wild mushroom risotto, then fish. For dessert, a huge pandoro (golden bread) is unwrapped, grappa bottles appear, and as midnight strikes, the present-opening begins.  Midnight Mass in Saint Mark&apos;s is an unforgettable experience, but usually attended by tourists; Venetians prefer to walk to their local church. And kids here don&apos;t hang out stockings or expect Babbo Natale, (Father Christmas) to leave presents: that happens on the Epiphany, 12 days after Christmas, when Santa is replaced by the Befana, a wicked witch who flies in on a broomstick.John Brunton \u00b7 John Brunton is a journalist and photographer who lives in Venice and Paris. Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo Our festivities start on Christmas Eve. I go to the local church early in the day with other neighbours to help decorate it. Then all the family get together, dressed up in their best clothes, and at 10pm we walk back to the church, where we will stay, singing and dancing, until 6am the next day.  The church will be full of people of all ages. A choir sings; the pastor gives a sermon in either in French or Lingala, depending how well he speaks either language; adults and children act out the nativity; and we give thanks to God for looking after us to the end of another year. People give their own testimonies; we sing hymns (mostly Congolese ones); there is drumming and a synthesiser; people blow whistles and cry out with joy and we dance all night. The atmosphere is really joyous! When we get home, I feel so great that I don&apos;t go to bed. I just start preparing the meal. Everyone tries to make sure they have a chicken for Christmas dinner, but some years, when I didn&apos;t have work, we just had rice and pondu (a basic Congolese dish made from wild spinach and peanuts).  The electricity supply is often down here, but on Christmas Day the electricity company usually makes an effort. I do some cooking ahead just in case. If you really get stuck without electricity you can hire a generator for the day for between $30 and $50 - but that&apos;s a lot of money.  I have a tap in my house, but sometimes the water supply is also cut. When our reserve supply runs out we have to fetch water, carrying it in tubs on our heads. With my cousins, sisters and daughters I prepare the Christmas dinner. I roast the chicken, make a special cabbage salad and prepare the salt fish. I make a cake for dessert but that&apos;s my choice - some people have biscuits, or other things.  Last year, I had around 20 people to feed, and I also made plates of food for neighbours who don&apos;t have the means to do their own dinner. We might have a bottle of red wine and perhaps some sangria and sucres (fizzy drinks), but no one gets drunk.  After dinner there is a present for each of my children, but they don&apos;t make a fuss if there are none. They know some children don&apos;t know what it is to ever get a present. During Christmas we play music. I like to put on hymns but the children soon change that to things they like, even some Western music - Shakira, things like that. In the evening the young men will often go out to a bistro. I won&apos;t allow my girls out as there are always lots of pregnancies from that night of partying, drinking and disorder. This year my big worry is the rain. It usually rains here on Christmas Day, as it is the middle of the rainy season. When it rains, water floods into my house and even comes up through the tiles in the floor around my bed, bringing in dirt from outside. I want to move house. Recently, I had to sleep in a plastic chair and the children had to sleep on a mattress in the kitchen to stay dry. My favourite part of Christmas is for everyone to be together. Being with my children and the rest of my family and eating together - that&apos;s what makes me feel good.Sophie Kasengela \u00b7 Sophie Kasengela, 44, is a mother of five and works as a housekeeper. Moscow, Russia There are not, if I&apos;m honest, many advantages to winter in Moscow. Apart from one: you are guaranteed snow, lots of it. Last month, we tested our sledging gear for the first time. On Christmas Day we plan to return to the park just behind our Moscow flat. Here, there is a terrific gully - our kids, Tilly, 10, and Ruskin, seven, have discovered their favourite whooshing spot, underneath the silver birch trees. I too am partial to a bit of whizzing; my wife, Phoebe, however, thinks I&apos;m a middle-aged oaf-person.  After this, the plan is to return home for the obligatory present-fest and then round off Christmas Day with an episode or two of Doctor Who. (We are still on the series with Christopher Ecclestone and Billie Piper -being behind the times is one of the drawbacks of expat life.)  The major difference between Russia and Britain is that Christmas in Russia isn&apos;t Christmas. In Russia 25 December is a working day. Commuters commute, trolleybuses trolley, and even Vladimir Putin doesn&apos;t get a day off. Russians celebrate Christmas 13 days later, on 7 January. (This is the date of Christ&apos;s birth according to the Julian calendar; Russia&apos;s orthodox church has always gone with the Julian date.) The confusion is also partly the fault of the god-hating Bolsheviks: up until 1917 Russians celebrated Christmas on 25 December like everyone else. The communists did their best to kill off Christmas and St Nicholas - renaming him Grandfather Frost. Instead, New Year became Russia&apos;s main winter festival. There are several important rituals around this time - one of which includes getting stuck in traffic. Going anywhere by car in Moscow is difficult. Just before New Year it&apos;s impossible: the number of vehicles goes up by 25 per cent as everyone buys presents. It&apos;s generally quicker to sledge. Russians begin partying big-time on New Year&apos;s Eve - embarking on a two-week orgy of drinking, flirting and work-dodging that stretches into the middle of January.  Present-swapping takes place on New Year&apos;s Eve. It&apos;s traditional also to pop bottles of Russian-made &apos;Sovietsky&apos; champagne at midnight. Since the fall of communism, Christmas on 7 January has enjoyed a minor comeback. Religious Russians go to church; everyone else simply enjoys the day off. There is also fortune-telling and boot-throwing. (Unmarried girls throw boots over their shoulder. Where the boot lands will, so it is said, point them in the direction of their future husbands.) As for us - we&apos;ll be in Bangkok. Hurrah! There&apos;s only so much snow a family can take, after all. Luke Harding \u00b7 Luke Harding is The Observer&apos;s Moscow correspondent. Rothera Research Station, Antarctica If there&apos;s one place in the world where you are guaranteed a white Christmas, it&apos;s surely Antarctica. With the frozen continent holding some 90 per cent of the world&apos;s ice, there is no shortage of white stuff to get you into that festive spirit. But strangely enough, that is probably as Christmassy as it gets. Having daylight for 24 hours brings a summery rather than an early-nights-and-log-fires feel to the place. And without the now-obligatory November Christmas tree and shops bursting at the seams, the carefully crafted expectation is not built up as it is back home. Indeed, a far bigger celebration here is midwinter, in June, which marks the darkest day of the year and the meridian of the long isolated winter for all those fortunate enough to call Antarctica their (albeit temporary) home. I live in Rothera Research Station, the largest of the British Antarctic Survey&apos;s research stations, on the Antarctic Peninsula. It is a collection of relatively small buildings perched on a promontory over a bay filled with icebergs, whales, seals and penguins. The nearest human habitation is 100 miles away, and even that is another research station. It is a beautiful, majestic land of glittering ice and unspoilt wilderness unexploited by man - promising adventure and commanding awe in all who behold it. Christmas Day itself still has many of the features to which we have all grown accustomed back in the UK. Our two chefs will be working hard ahead of time to prepare four turkeys to fill a hundred hungry mouths, supplemented by pigs-in-a-blanket, stuffing, bread sauce, cranberry sauce, Brussels sprouts, mince pies and my personal favourite, Christmas pudding. Ahead of time (but possibly only just), parts of the main building with be dressed in shining stars and twinkling tinsel. The dining room will be the main focus of our decorative efforts, and will house our two Christmas trees. When 25 December itself comes we will all enjoy a day off work, making the most of the opportunity to take our time eating that gargantuan meal all together. The people here have become friends, and for those of us now approaching our second winter on base, this is very much our proxy family. Inevitably many will miss those sitting 10,000 miles away in the UK, but there is no shortage of friends here. For the rest of the day, though, the contrasts with the British Christmas are apparent. The Christmas film may be enjoyed by some, but for others, myself included, it will be usurped by a Christmas ski around the local area. The Queen&apos;s speech will probably be deposed by a speech from our base commander, or our oratorical French chef.  But while we were blessed with the ultimate excuse for not braving the high street scrum of Christmas consumerism (the shop here is pretty limited, I&apos;m afraid), those of us with friends and family who went to the shops for us, sometimes nearly five months in advance to allow for shipping time, will still have some presents to open. The question for me now is: where am I going to hang my stocking?Alistair Simpson \u00b7Dr Alistair Simpson is the 2007 wintering doctor at Rothera Research Station, looking after the health of the station staff and researching fitness and body composition. See antarctica.ac.uk Beijing, China In a country where religion is not promoted, Christmas in Beijing is reduced to its most self-indulgent basics: eating, drinking and being merry. You might say it has all the fun without any religious or familial guilt. Although the main festival is Chinese New Year [7 February in 2008] - when families get together and presents, often simply cash, are given - Christmas is quickly taking hold here. For many Beijingers the iconic image of Christmas - Santa, with his rotund girth and big grin - feels comfortingly similar to that of the fat laughing Buddha.  By the first week of December, Christmas fever has kicked in. Full-size Santas stand guard outside shops and galleries and the capital looks increasingly like a European city, with bright lights covering the trees and shopfronts, the occasional frosting of snow forcing people to wrap in long scarves, and even the whiff of chestnuts roasting on the street.  Beijingers love to spend, and any excuse to splash cash - on food and drink, gifts and cards - is embraced wholeheartedly. Parents who give traditional New Year gifts are now also lavishing their only children with chocolates and toys at Christmas, and the giving of small presents between school kids have become de rigueur. A few years ago, the best alternative to a Christmas tree was a vibrant pot plant, so I was surprised this year to find the streets surrounding the flower markets scattered with browning pine trees that quite clearly wouldn&apos;t survive till Christmas Eve. But with all the &apos;Made in China&apos; plastic trees, baubles and fairy lights costing practically nothing, it has been easy enough to make our flat look festive for just a few quid.  Christmas Day is a working day, but most expats make sure to take a few days&apos; annual leave so they can party the weekend before and stuff themselves silly on the big day while watching James Bond films bought for 50p from the knock-off DVD shop.  While many expats, and the newly wealthy Chinese, head to a five-star restaurant banquet on the 25th, this year we will have roast goose, home-made mince pies and a Christmas cake. At least it will make a change from duck.Tom Pattison  \u00b7 Tom Pattison is editor-in-chief of Time Out Beijing, published monthly in China. Delhi, India  In the days of British imperial India, homesick English families made laborious attempts to celebrate Christmas much as they would have done at home.  In the vice-regal lodge in Calcutta &apos;there was always a fancy dress ball and a children&apos;s party where Father Christmas entered on an elephant&apos;, Charles Allen writes in Plain Tales from the Raj. &apos;The British had their own rituals. The first was the arrival in September of the catalogue sent around in good time to enable customers to choose what they would like dispatched from London for Christmas,&apos; Allen continues. &apos;The Christmas dinner and the Christmas cake followed the familiar pattern, although peafowl - &quot;beautifully white flesh but very, very dry&quot; - frequently took the place of tinned turkey.&apos;  A century has passed, India&apos;s political and economic landscape has changed beyond recognition, and now it&apos;s as easy to hop on a British Airways flight home as it is to buy air-freighted cranberries in Delhi. But for those in the diplomatic community who are preparing gloomily to spend Christmas here, the same preoccupations remain.  India has 13 million Christians, but most live in the south. Although Christmas is a national public holiday, in Delhi, the days preceding 25 December have none of the excitement that marks the lead-up to Diwali, the Hindu festival of light celebrated earlier in the autumn.  As a result, American and European expatriates still go to great lengths to recreate the Christmas atmosphere. Instead of a mail-order catalogue, families living in the gated compounds of the British High Commission or the Canadian or US Embassies, fill in internet orders for their Christmas requirements at least six weeks ahead of time, to allow their consignments of mincemeat and bread sauce mix to be shipped over.  Those living outside the compounds have to rely on Delhi&apos;s famous French poultry farmer, a notoriously irascible man who has a small farm in an industrial suburb of Delhi. Sometimes he agrees to deliver turkey; sometimes - if you call at the wrong time, or sound too American - he declines. As a last resort, there is the stinking and unhygienic INA market, where large hens, slaughtered and plucked on the spot, provide a plausible alternative.  Across the city at Khan Market - a searingly expensive collection of shops frequented by Delhi&apos;s growing community of super-rich, as well as foreigners - inflatable Father Christmases obstruct the pavement, emitting tinny Chinese renditions of &apos;Santa Claus is Coming to Town&apos;. Shops offer hand-painted baubles with Christmas scenes of snow and fir trees, never witnessed by the people who made them.  Not everything is available. Despite the powerful forces of globalisation, which have brought Swarovski crystals and Marmite to a market which used to stock only local produce, Brussels sprouts remain unobtainable (to everyone&apos;s relief).  The children&apos;s party entertainment is unchanged. At this time of year, in the diplomatic enclave of New Delhi, a weary-looking elephant can occasionally be seen loping along the wide streets, led by a man in a peculiar, but just identifiable, Father Christmas outfit; the pair can be booked by the hour for party entertainment. In the evenings, a band of Salvation Army choristers, wearing pink Father Christmas masks so alarming they reduce children to tears, ring doorbells, singing Christmas carols in Hindi.  For a British community nostalgic for traditional festivities, there is the annual Christmas pantomime, put on by embassy volunteers and teachers from the British school. It&apos;s redolent of the amateur dramatics enjoyed by the ladies of the Raj during their summer retreat to the hill stations. Last year&apos;s Aladdin/A Lad in Delhi, had belly-dancing men in drag and cardboard rickshaws, and left everyone unfamiliar with the genre profoundly bemused.  Indian Christian families in Delhi do not share the British obsession with turkey or ritualised meals of pre-determined dishes. Families cook sweets such as gujia, sweet fried dough-balls flavoured with nuts and cardamom, which are also prepared for Hindu festivals like holi. Churches offer all-night mass, with services in Hindi and English.  But despite everyone&apos;s best efforts, it is impossible not to feel that Christmas here is a tame occasion in comparison with the wild abandon of Diwali, when so many fire crackers are let off that the city hangs heavy with smog for weeks.Amelia Gentleman Sydney, Australia After four cold, dark Christmases in the UK, I&apos;m back in Sydney this year, and everything is in place for a traditional Aussie Christmas.  Humidity is enveloping me like a blanket. The smell of jasmine dances on the warm afternoon breeze. The hum of cicadas drowns out conversation. And the tarmac squelches underfoot as I cross George Street to buy my first Christmas card - featuring Santa wearing boardshorts and driving a sleigh pulled by kangaroos. The grocers have started selling stone fruit, too. Unlike in the UK, where fruit and vegetables are jetted in from all over the world, fresh produce is still seasonal here.  The appearance of cherries, peaches and plums on the supermarket shelves is as good a sign as any that Santa is on his way. Indeed, the first box of cherries of the season is auctioned for charity. This year it fetched A$35,000 (\u00a315,000) for the Children&apos;s Hospital.  The English backpackers will spend Christmas on Bondi Beach, drinking beer, getting sunburnt and keeping the lifesavers busy. I&apos;ll be at home, sweltering through a full Christmas roast with all the trimmings. Christmas Eve is for having a few beers with mates, somewhere near a beach, preferably with a kilo or two of prawns. But on Christmas Day I&apos;ll sit down at the dinner table in the sweltering heat, apply the paper crown from my Christmas cracker to my sweaty forehead, and work my way through the turkey, the chicken, the pork and the ham that mum got up at dawn to prepare in a kitchen where the temperature is pushing 40C.  I&apos;ll finish the meal with the traditional Christmas pudding that we all had to stir when mum was making it. It&apos;ll be smothered in hot brandy custard and also peppered with A$2 coins that my mum presses into it as it is served. Boxing Day is traditionally a much less arduous affair. I&apos;ll spend the day in front of the telly watching the Boxing Day Test live from Melbourne. We&apos;re playing India this year, and while it will be great to see Sachin Tendulkar play in Oz for the last time, it won&apos;t be as sweet as last year, when we beat the English and Warnie got his 700th wicket.  I&apos;ll have a cold beer in my hand and there&apos;ll be a selection of cold cuts left over from Christmas dinner to gorge myself on. Sure, I&apos;ll be missing the EastEnders Christmas special.

Visit his website at petermoore.net  Mexico City, Mexico If you&apos;re spending Christmas in Mexico, make sure you get yourself lots of bright red flowers - locals believe they can bring you good luck for the rest of the year. They take this superstition so seriously that they cover their homes with poinsettia - known in Mexico as the Christmas Flower - and the main streets and avenues become a sea of red.  In the Zocalo, Mexico City&apos;s huge main square, the world&apos;s largest ice-rink entertains young and old alike, while the city&apos;s many markets are busy with people searching for the perfect pine tree with which to decorate their home. Christmas carols here are played by mariachi, groups of street musicians. The biggest family dinner of the year is held on Christmas Eve. A traditional dinner would include turkey, but roast beef or pork are gradually becoming more common as a main dish. You can also have typical tamales, steam-cooked corn meal dough with a filling - and lots of hot spices, of course.  Every town in Mexico will hold a procession on the nine days before Christmas called a posada, a ceremony that symbolises the trials Mary and Joseph endured before finding a place for Jesus to be born. During the posadas people hang pinatas, large star-shaped containers made of papier mache and filled with toys and sweets, from trees or lampposts. Blindfolded children try to break them open with a stick, allowing the treats to pour out, to great excitement. And while children in the UK eagerly wait for Santa Claus to deliver gifts, Mexican kids must wait until 6 January, when the Three Kings, Los Reyes, arrive on horseback loaded with presents. In recent years children have also taken to writing to Santa - but rather than being posted to Lapland, the letters are hidden in the children&apos;s shoes.Javier Espinoza \u00b7 Javier Espinoza is a freelance journalist who was born in El Salvador and has travelled widely in Mexico, especially at Christmas.", "publicationDate": "2007-12-23T12:20:38Z", "tags": ["Christmas", "Life and style"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2007/dec/23/christmas", "title": "Christmas around the world", "sentences": ["As for us - we&apos;ll be in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "The successor party of deposed Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra claimed victory last night in the first election since the military coup 15 months ago, fuelling fears of further political uncertainty. The Thai election authority&apos;s unofficial tally with most votes counted showed that the People Power party (PPP) won 228 seats, less than an outright majority in the 480-seat parliament, but well ahead of its key rival, the Democrat party, which was headed for just 166. The electorate&apos;s damning verdict on the coup, if borne out by the final results revealed today, is likely to provoke a protracted period of negotiation as the PPP seeks to form a coalition government. But the outcome heralds the strong possibility of Thaksin&apos;s return from his London exile as the PPP leadership pledged on the campaign trail that it would dissolve the agencies appointed by the junta to probe corruption charges against the billionaire tycoon who bought Manchester City football club. Watching from Hong Kong as the results rolled in, Thaksin, 58, raised the spectre of a comeback. That would be a disaster for the military which staged the coup to rid Thai politics of such a divisive figure. &quot;I would suggest that if we [the PPP] form a national reconciliation government then things will move from there and get smoother and smoother,&quot; he said. &quot;Probably somewhere around mid-February they will have a democratic government. I will consider then when I should go back.&quot; Last night the PPP leader, veteran rightwinger Samak Sundaravej, 72, said that if he formed the new government, Thaksin would come back to Thailand and fight his case. Samak added that if possible he would grant an amnesty to Thaksin and the other 110 members of the dissolved Thai Rak Thai party who were barred from politics for five years by a junta-appointed tribunal. &quot;If we form a coalition government I will be prime minister for sure,&quot; he told cheering loyalists at the party&apos;s Bangkok headquarters, revealing that he had already held talks with potential partners. &quot;Any party that wants can come and join us so that our country can make progress.&quot; But analysts believe Thailand&apos;s military and royalist elite will press mid-ranking parties to side with the Democrats. Last night PPP executives expressed concern that the third and fourth placed parties, Chart Thai and Puea Paendin, were summoned to see the Thai king&apos;s chief adviser, former prime minister General Prem Tinsulanonda. The junta had pinned its hopes on 43-year-old Abhisit Vejjajiva, the Newcastle-born Eton- and Oxford-educated leader of the Democrats, to counter Thaksin&apos;s charisma. But Thailand&apos;s oldest political party, despite Abhisit&apos;s widely admired reputation for honesty, failed to make inroads in PPP strongholds among the rural poor away from the urban elite, which still detests Thaksin for his autocratic style in government. &quot;I voted for the Democrats because I hate Thaksin,&quot; said Jessie Siamwalla, 35, a music company owner. &quot;He caused so many problems for the country when he was prime minister, and he was corrupt too.&quot; Yet even for those who welcomed the coup in their desperation to see the back of Thaksin, the promise turned sour as the economy floundered and most became equally keen to see the soldiers back in barracks. &quot;I voted for the Democrats because I don&apos;t want to see the PPP back in power because they were bad and may provoke unrest,&quot; said Krit Pholtanawasit, a 28-year-old sales manager. &quot;But if they win, that&apos;s what the majority decides and that&apos;s democracy. It&apos;s better the army goes and respects the people&apos;s choice.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2007-12-24T09:11:05Z", "tags": ["World news", "Thailand", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/24/thailand.mainsection", "title": "Election triumph could herald Thaksin's return", "sentences": ["&quot;If we form a coalition government I will be prime minister for sure,&quot; he told cheering loyalists at the party&apos;s Bangkok headquarters, revealing that he had already held talks with potential partners."]}, {"article": "Fifteen months after the military coup that ousted billionaire prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the return to democratic rule in Thailand has failed to resolve the country&apos;s deep divisions and bitter antagonisms. The pro-Thaksin party has bagged the largest number of seats at polls on December 23. After last year&apos;s coup, Thaksin and his closest cohorts were banned from engaging in politics for five years. His party was dismantled prior to the election. But pro-Thaksin forces readily regrouped under the banner of a new party - the People Power Party - using the offices and machinery of the proscribed Thai Rak Thai party. It was an extraordinary proxy victory for the deposed leader-in-exile, and clearly not the result that the Thai military leaders were hoping for. Though victorious, Thaksin is still far from vindicated. He hovered in Hong Kong during the election and its aftermath, exulting in his apparent comeback. He now wants to return home but faces still faces a raft of corruption charges (on which he predictably proclaims his innocence). While the election was a victory for the well-oiled pro-Thaksin party machine in the north and north-east of Thailand, and a rejection of the military coup, many western media reports of Thaksin being &quot;vindicated&quot; are wrong on several accounts. First, this was no landslide victory. The main opposition force, the Democrat Party, won 165 seats (to PPP&apos;s 233) with a clean sweep of Bangkok, the capital, and as usual dominated constituencies in the south. (The Democrat Party was also opposed to military rule.) Secondly, the manner of the PPP/pro-Thaksin victory in their strongholds is tainted with allegations of massive vote-buying and irregularities. Montri Kiatkhamjorn, a senior officer for the Election Commission, the poll watchdog, in the north-east reckons &quot;maybe 50%&quot; of candidates are buying votes in the region.&quot; Former senator Kraisak Choonhavan, a staunch opponent of all Thailand&apos;s many military regimes, who ran as Democrat candidate in Korat, claims Thaksin poured billions of baht into the region to buy votes, with the active complicity of local administration officials. He claims that 300 baht (4.7 Stg)was paid to 462,700 voters in Korat. If that is true it would add up to \u00a32 million deployed to keep the voters loyal. Given that Thaskin&apos;s fortune has been estimated at $4 billion and he admits to $2 billion, it should come as no surprise that his wealth works wonders among some of the poorest voters in the north-east, which is precisely where his party machine is strongest. Apart from election disputes and alleged vote-buying, Thaksin cannot possibly be vindicated until the many cases of alleged corruption and fraud already filed in the courts during 2007 are judged by the courts. The attorney-general&apos;s office has been pushing for the extradition of Thaksin and his wife from Britain, where the former premier owns a home and has purchased the Manchester City football club for \u00a384 million. Arrest warrants were issued by the supreme court on corruption and graft charges. If he returns home he faces immediate arrest. In addition, a recent inquiry by the National Human Rights Commission found that 2,656 people were killed during Thaksin&apos;s &quot;war on drugs&quot; campaign in 2003 and concluded that the ousted prime minister was guilty of endorsing a shoot-to-kill policy against drug suspects, many of whom were subsequently proved to be innocent. This killing spree by police death squads could have been stopped, but Thaksin has never expressed regrets nor any moral qualms. No matter how popular he may be among certain sections of Thai voters, there is no vindication from the claim made by Brad Adams of Human Rights Watch Asia that Thaksin is &quot;a human rights abuser of the worst kind&quot;. Mass protests about Thaksin&apos;s arrogant pursuit of greed was triggered by the sale of his telecom empire to a Singapore state investment body from a whopping tax-free profit while still prime minister in 2006. These massive Bangkok demonstrations against Thaksin&apos;s rule eventually led to a peaceful military coup tacitly endorsed by the royal palace advisers close to Thailand&apos;s revered king. The country has now come the full circle. Military rule has been discredited. The December election has brought back normalisation. &quot;Normal&quot; in Thai politics means rampant vote-buying, weak coalitions, horse-trading and duplicity between the various parties. If the pro-Thaksin PPP can form a new government, their campaign promise includes bringing Thaksin home, amnesty and attempts to do away with the Assets Examination Committee (AEC) tasked with unearthing evidence against their hero. The campaign to rehabilitate Thaksin on the one hand, and the military&apos;s continuing role as self-appointed guardians of society, are the two key issues retarding a full return to democracy. Both Thaksin and the generals that oppose him represent two brands of authoritarian rule: one based on arms and weapons, and the other based on a tainted ballot-box and a huge election spending sprees. But millions of Thai citizens are searching for a third force to lead them out of turmoil and confrontation, and towards much-needed national reconciliation between pro- and anti-Thaksin in voters. Clearly that aspiration cannot be achieved by 72-year-old rightist political dinosaur Samak Sundaravej, the leader of the PPP party and the political nominee of Thaksin in exile. He is as controversial and divisive as Thaksin himself, yet after protracted coalition deals, he will probably become the country&apos;s next prime minister - a prospect that alarms millions in the capital, Bangkok. However, no Thai government can be expected to survive for long without support from Bangkokians in the capital, and without acceptance from professional and business sectors and people that run the country. Thailand will not be able to escape from more rounds of protest demonstrations and rallies, as long as Thaksin or his subalterns keep their unsavoury grip on the nation&apos;s affairs.", "publicationDate": "2007-12-30T12:00:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/30/abillionairescomeback", "title": "A billionaire's comeback?", "sentences": ["The main opposition force, the Democrat Party, won 165 seats (to PPP&apos;s 233) with a clean sweep of Bangkok, the capital, and as usual dominated constituencies in the south.", "These massive Bangkok demonstrations against Thaksin&apos;s rule eventually led to a peaceful military coup tacitly endorsed by the royal palace advisers close to Thailand&apos;s revered king.", "He is as controversial and divisive as Thaksin himself, yet after protracted coalition deals, he will probably become the country&apos;s next prime minister - a prospect that alarms millions in the capital, Bangkok.", "However, no Thai government can be expected to survive for long without support from Bangkokians in the capital, and without acceptance from professional and business sectors and people that run the country."]}]}
