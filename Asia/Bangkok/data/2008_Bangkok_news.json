They are both teachers THE BRIEF: &apos;We want some winter sun, somewhere with clean, quiet beaches - possibly a naturist beach - and good hiking terrain, ideally over half term or in the March holidays. We would like self-catering so we&apos;re not tied to a hotel; we&apos;re both foodies and like to eat in local restaurants or buy local produce to cook. I was brought up in South Africa and love the starscape closer to the equator, and a beach remote enough to watch the stars would be lovely. I like the Med, but don&apos;t think it will be warm enough, and don&apos;t know much about the Canaries, but that might work.&apos; BUDGET: \u00a33,000 or so for two weeks THE SOLUTION:  Philip Davies from Real Holidays: &apos;I would suggest a two-centre holiday to the Cape Verde Islands. They could take the new six-hour flight to Boa Vista with its unspoilt white beaches and relatively low-key Italian tourist development, and spend seven nights at the bungalow-style Hotel Parque das Dunas (00 238 251 1283; parquedasdunas.com) before hopping on a 16-seater plane to Santiago island with its busy capital, Praia, where they would be based for six nights at the Hotel Pestana (00 238 261 4200; pestana.com). Being in town will allow them to check out local restaurants and they can hike in the dramatic green interior. I&apos;m not sure about the naturist beaches, though! The cost with Holiday Options (0844 477 9999; holidayoptions.co.uk) would be \u00a32,784, departing 18 March, including flights, transfers and bed and breakfast. Cape Verde Experience (01489 866969; capeverdeexperience.com) could organise a similar trip for around the same price, staying at the Quinta da Montanha on Santiago, a family-run retreat in the mountains, ideal for walkers.&apos; Andrew Appleby from Trailfinders: &apos;They should consider the Caribbean, as it offers self-catering options and great weather. St Lucia has pristine beaches and a volcanic interior of lush rainforest where they can hike the Gros Piton Nature Trail. At five-star Cotton Bay Village (0845 217 7849; cottonbayvillage.com) the two-bedroom Tamarind Suites have fully equipped kitchens and a beach to themselves. There&apos;s an onsite deli and it&apos;s close enough to Rodney Bay for shopping and restaurants. For authentic food, the local &apos;fish fry&apos; every Friday at the nearby fishing village, Anse La Raye, is not to be missed.&apos;  Bob Atkinson from Travelsupermarket.com: &apos;Morocco during the Easter break could offer an excellent holiday experience. Worldwalks.com (01242 633680) has a 10-day walking tour taking in Casablanca, Fez, the Atlas Mountains and Marrakesh, with lots of opportunities to eat local delicacies, and some challenging hikes. You stay in traditional riads - different from the usual hotels - and they could add a side trip to Agadir for four days on the beach. Temperatures should be in the high teens to low 20s. The tour costs around \u00a31,100 per person, with four nights in Agadir from \u00a3250 per person in a five-star hotel. Flights and transfers will cost from \u00a3100 to \u00a3200 each based on flying to Casablanca and back from Agadir or Marrakesh.&apos; THE YOUNG FAMILY Jemma Chapman, 36, lives in London with partner Lindsay Perkins, 31, an IT systems analyst, and daughter Tess, one  THE BRIEF: &apos;What with me being pregnant for most of 2006, then getting used to the demands of a baby, we haven&apos;t had a proper holiday for two years and really need one to recharge our batteries and celebrate getting through the first year of parenthood! We definitely want sun, but nowhere too hot for Tess. We would like somewhere where we can relax (on a beach or by a lake) but also want some places for a few outings (markets or castles). Tess loves animals so anywhere with wildlife would be a bonus.  &apos;We would fly up to five hours to get somewhere warm, and are happy to consider southern/eastern Europe (Croatia or Turkey perhaps) in February or March.&apos; THE BUDGET: Around \u00a3600 for a week THE SOLUTION: Becky Stephenson from Travel Counsellors: &apos;Cyprus is four-and-a-half hours from the UK and will be warm in February. I would suggest a week at the Paphos Garden Apartments. Just 20 minutes from the airport, it has an indoor pool, free cots and high chairs and is 300m from the beach and a stroll away from Paphos harbour. There&apos;s lots to do, from visiting the Tomb of the Kings to exploring the Troodos mountains or checking out Paphos old town.  &apos;It&apos;s good to hire a car: they drive on the left and signs are in English. The cost for flights, transfers and apartment is \u00a3639 travelling on 27 February with First Choice (0871 200 7799; firstchoice.co.uk).&apos; Andrew Appleyard from Trailfinders: &apos;Europe is the best bet for flying time and to fit the budget. Croatia and Turkey have good beaches and plenty of culture, but temperatures would be chilly, so I would recommend Madeira or the Canary Islands. Madeira has good year-round sun, golden beaches, small villages and local markets. For \u00a3600 they could stay at the four-star Dom Pedro Baia hotel near the historic town of Machico, including breakfast and flights with TAP Air Portugal.  &apos;The other option would be Tenerife, where they could chill by the pool or take day trips to animal parks or Mount Teide. Many people think of lager-louty Playa de las Americas when they think of Tenerife, but there are much quieter parts of the island. A week B&amp;B in three-star Hotel Bahia Flamingo in Guia de Isora including flights with BA would be \u00a3650. &apos; Bob Atkinson from Travelsupermarket.com: &apos;Travelling with a baby needs to be as easy as possible, with short travelling times. Why not go to Marbella on the Costa del Sol (around two-and-half hours away)? Temperatures average in the high teens, so not too warm for your baby, in late March. There are great beaches and plenty to do along the coast and in the city of Malaga. They could hire a car and visit Granada and the Alhambra [pictured left], or head inland to dramatic Ronda with its stunning gorge.  &apos;Flights cost from \u00a350pp to Malaga; a week&apos;s B&amp;B at the four-star Andalucia Plaza in Marbella (00 34 95281 2000; h10hotels.com) costs \u00a3450 and it has lots of facilities, including a spa. Three-day car hire costs from \u00a359 including an infant seat.&apos; THE SOLO TRAVELLER Sophy Williams, 38, is a sports marketing consultant and translator from Winchester THE BRIEF: &apos;I&apos;ve been in business by myself for three years and haven&apos;t had a holiday for ages. Although I travel a lot for work I never have a chance to explore. I want to get away on my own somewhere warm in late January or February. I like the idea of a yoga/meditation holiday, or perhaps somewhere with great marine life or wildlife. I fancy Thailand, but are there still places there that haven&apos;t been ruined? &apos;I&apos;ve had enough holidays that were about partying in the past; this time I want to relax and just enjoy some peace and quiet.&apos; THE BUDGET: \u00a32,000 for two weeks, but could splash out for something exceptional. THE SOLUTION:  Zoe Stebbing from Lotus Journeys: &apos;I would suggest a yoga and activity holiday on Thailand&apos;s Phi Phi Island [pictured below], staying at the Phi Phi Viewpoint Resort (00 66 7562 2351; phiphiviewpoint.com). Days start with early-morning meditation, followed by a vigorous yoga class, and there&apos;s sunset yoga too. There&apos;s diving, snorkelling, rock-climbing, Thai cookery courses and a massage centre. It&apos;s fantastic value at \u00a3450 single occupancy for a week, including yoga and three dinners (excluding courses and flights). Sophy could then head to Koh Samui and the luxury Kamalaya Spa (00 66 7742 9800; kamalaya.com). Yoga and detox packages cost from \u00a31,400 a week full-board.&apos; Stephanie Wienrich from Neal&apos;s Yard Agency: &apos;For a yoga retreat with wildlife-spotting opportunities try Ulpotha (020 8123 3603; ulpotha.com) in Sri Lanka. Frequented by mango-eating monkeys, iridescent birds, and butterflies as big as your palm, it&apos;s on a lake suitable for swimming. From 20 January-3 February British yoga teacher Claire Farman will be taking two hatha yoga classes a day, with an emphasis on meditation, from \u00a31,300 for two weeks&apos; full-board, including yoga, massages and sightseeing (it&apos;s in the island&apos;s &apos;cultural triangle&apos;) but excluding flights. Direct flights to Colombo cost from \u00a3500. Or Sophy could head to Kerala, India, to enjoy daily Ayurvedic treatments and yoga at Ayurveda Ocean Village, south of Kovalam. Two weeks&apos; full-board costs from \u00a31,380, including yoga and meditation and an Ayurvedic treatment package, but not flights. Indirect return flights from London to Trivandrum cost from \u00a3350.&apos; Becky Stephenson from Travel Counsellors: &apos;This is a little over budget but when she sees the hotel, Uma Ubud (00 62 361 972448; uma.como.bz) a holistic retreat in Bali, I am sure Sophy will agree it&apos;s worth the extra. It&apos;s a sanctuary hidden from the outside world, but should Sophy wish to tear herself away for a day or two, there are excursions such as mountain biking, white-water rafting and the chance to see monkeys. She may just prefer to indulge herself at the spa and join the yoga or meditation sessions. The cost of a 10-day holiday with various departures in January and February would be \u00a32,600, through Seasons in Style (01244 202000; seasonsinstyle.com).&apos; THE SUN-SEEKING DOCTORS  Eleanor Macdougall, 26, lives in Leicester with her boyfriend, Dan Jones, 24. They are both doctors THE BRIEF: &apos;We&apos;ve both been busy with work and are desperate for a week&apos;s sun after a miserable summer. I&apos;m keen to rest but usually get bored just lying on a beach and need some sights (I&apos;ve enjoyed Egypt, South Africa and Morocco in the past). Dan hasn&apos;t travelled much and doesn&apos;t want anywhere too scary. We&apos;re not keen on India. We would love some peace and quiet and are happy with fairly basic accommodation. We like diving, watersports, and day trips to cultural sites. We will stretch to a 10-hour flight to get some decent sunshine.&apos; THE BUDGET: \u00a32,000 for a week THE SOLUTION:  Philip Davies from Real Holidays: &apos;I would suggest Zanzibar using BA&apos;s direct flight to Dar es Salaam followed by a 20-minute hop to the island (0870 850 9850; ba.com). Although it&apos;s becoming more popular, the Shooting Star Inn (00 255 747 414166; zanzibar.org/star) is laidback, with only 12 rooms. It has recently risen a grade or two, adding an infinity pool, and its restaurant has an excellent reputation. It is worth paying a bit more for a sea-view cottage, which would cost \u00a31,080 each including flights, transfers and breakfast and dinner, with Rainbow Tours (020 7226 1004; rainbowtours.co.uk). There&apos;s lots to do, from visits to Stone Town or a spice tour to great diving.&apos; Becky Stephenson from Travel Counsellors: &apos;I would suggest Grenada, &quot;the spice island&quot;, which has friendly people, a relaxed pace of life, secluded coves, abundant water activities and fantastic restaurants. Stay at the intimate Blue Horizons Garden Resort (00 1 473 444 4316; grenadabluehorizons.com) on a self-catering basis, just 300m from Grand Anse beach, with complimentary non-motorised watersports. There are lots of excursions, from visiting the spice markets and harbour in St George to boat trips. Departing on 10 February, this would cost \u00a31,550 for two, with Excel flights.&apos;  Andrew Appleby from Trailfinders: &apos;Oman is wonderful, and just a six-and-a-half-hour flight away. Steeped in history, with a magnificent rugged landscape and ancient heritage, it provides a surprising contrast to the skyscrapers of some of its Arabian neighbours. The capital, Muscat, has retained much of its ancient charm and its narrow streets and souks are fascinating, friendly places to explore. Beyond Muscat, you will often have beaches, dramatic gorges, hilltop castles or desert dunes [pictured above] all to yourself. Luxurious hotels on pristine unspoilt beaches include Shangri-La&apos;s Barr al Jissah Resort &amp; Spa (0800 028 3337; shangri-la.com). Seven nights&apos; B&amp;B costs \u00a31,430 for two, including flights. The resort has its own Padi dive centre.&apos; THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER Sheila Gaunt, 56, a government researcher, and her daughter Tess Hayden, 18, live in Marlow, Buckinghamshire  THE BRIEF: &apos;We are quite sporty, like energetic holidays and welcome a bit of adventure. A few years ago we visited Borneo, walked in the rainforest, tried white-water rafting and loved it. Tess is probably going on a gap year, so this could be something of a dress rehearsal. I love the Far East and would love to visit Vietnam, and also have yearnings for Bhutan or Tibet.  &apos;I&apos;ve grown tired of lazy beach holidays and am not keen on resorts full of discos. We&apos;ll need to go during school holidays really, and want to be away 10-14 days. Although the budget is not limitless I don&apos;t mind splashing out a bit as this may be our last holiday together.&apos;  THE BUDGET: Up to \u00a32,500 for two weeks THE SOLUTION:  Becky Stephenson from Travel Counsellors: &apos;I would suggest Thailand, combining city, beach and rainforest. Virgin Worldwide (0871 222 5825; virginholidays.co.uk) has a 14-day tour with three nights in Bangkok, three on the beach in Phuket and three in the hills in the north at the Elephant Hills Resort, where they can trek through the rainforest, raft on rivers [pictured above] and learn about elephants at a conservation project. They would then fly to Krabi for the final three nights soaking up local life and enjoying the beach. Shorter trips can be arranged too. The total cost is \u00a32,498 until 14 March or \u00a32,798 after.&apos; Philip Davies from Real Holidays: &apos;Sri Lanka is a good bet: it&apos;s compact and very beautiful, with hillsides covered in tea plantations and rainforest, ideal for walkers. They can try rafting again, too. There are plenty of cultural sights, from Buddhist citadels to hilltop fortresses, and great wildlife. I would suggest flying to Colombo, then driving to Unawatuna Beach Resort (unawatunabeachresort.com; 00 94 91438 4545) for three nights, then to The Tea Factory (00 94 11230 8408; aitkenspencehotels.com/teafactory) in the hill country for four nights, followed by two nights at the Mahaweli Reach hotel (00 94 8144 71883; mahaweli.com) in Kandy and four nights at Amaya Lake on Kandalama Lake (00 94 6644 68100; amayaresorts.com).  &apos;This would cost around \u00a32,800, including flights and a mix of bed-and-breakfast and half-board, a car and driver and excursions. A shorter option could be tailored if they want to go over half term.&apos; Bob Atkinson from Travelsupermarket.com: &apos;Why not combine Cambodia and Vietnam? They both have loads to offer the intrepid traveller and are a good dry run for a gap year. Several companies offer adventure-style holidays: STA&apos;s 10-day Spirit of Vietnam tour costs from \u00a3390 per person (0871 2300 040; statravel.co.uk).  &apos;Add on a four-day trip to Cambodia, including a visit to the temples of Angkor Wat and a couple of days in Phnom Penh, from around \u00a3300 per person for three-star accommodation. International and internal flights will cost around \u00a3600 per person, taking the total for two to around \u00a32,580.&apos;", "publicationDate": "2008-01-06T10:26:43Z", "tags": ["Travel", "Winter sun", "Beach holidays", "Family holidays", "Travelling solo", "Budget travel"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/jan/06/wintersun.beach", "title": "Bring us sunshine ...", "sentences": ["Virgin Worldwide (0871 222 5825; virginholidays.co.uk) has a 14-day tour with three nights in Bangkok, three on the beach in Phuket and three in the hills in the north at the Elephant Hills Resort, where they can trek through the rainforest, raft on rivers [pictured above] and learn about elephants at a conservation project."]}, {"article": "On the rooftop terrace of Angsana Riad Si Said in the heart of the old city of Marrakesh, a party is in full swing under a starry December sky. Guests laze in tented relaxation areas, smoking shisha as bellydancers shimmy, and the DJ dips into his Arabic lounge collection.  It&apos;s a big night for Angsana Resorts &amp; Spas - the younger, funkier, sister of Asia&apos;s Banyan Tree group. Tonight marks the official opening not just of Riad Si Said, but of the Angsana Riads Collection, the company&apos;s first foray into Africa. In 2005, Ho Kwon Ping, chairman of Banyan Tree Hotels &amp; Resorts, holidayed in Marrakesh with his wife and was so bowled over by the riad experience that he wanted to offer the same to his guests. For a company most associated with over-water pavilions on white sand beaches and Asian-style spas, it&apos;s something of a departure. But, just over two years on, Angsana has six properties in Marrakesh and two more open later this year (another in the city and one in the seaside resort of Essaouira), with guests being able to use the facilities at any of the riads. The term riad, which means garden house, is synonymous with boutique hotel in Marrakesh. They usually have just a handful of rooms grouped around a courtyard, and a stay in a riad is often the highlight of a trip to Morocco, offering an intimate, tranquil hideaway. Five of Angsana&apos;s riads are close to the Bahia Palace, in the old Jewish quarter; Riad Lydines, where I&apos;m staying, is 10 minutes&apos; walk away in the Kasbah area. Built from scratch four years ago, Lydines has an imposing facade opening onto a courtyard pool. There&apos;s a dining area with open fire, a dinky library and seven rooms and suites, all with impeccable decor marrying modern and traditional Moroccan. My suite has a spiral wrought iron staircase leading to a private rooftop hot tub - it&apos;s a busy couple of days, but I make time one evening to loll around in warm bubbling water listening to the sounds of the city below. You&apos;d be hard pushed to choose a favourite among the six riads. Each has its own charm. I love the historic feel of 19th-century Riad Si Said, where grand vizier Ba Ahmed kept his concubines. One of the best rooms is at Riad Blanc, a suite filled with blue and yellow light streaming in through stained glass windows, while the lovely, dark wooden courtyard of atmospheric Riad Tiwaline sticks in my mind. (The previous owner, a Frenchwoman, cried when she had to sell it to return to Paris.) Being in the Angsana group means, of course, that the spa element plays a key role. The buildings don&apos;t have space for full-blown facilities, but each property has its own treatment area and hammam, offering a blend of Asian and North African pampering. The Thai therapists have trained at Banyan Tree spa academies in Bangkok or Phuket, but learn the ancient art of the hammam from Moroccan staff. In the red tiled hammam at Riad Si Said, Khanittha from Phuket washes me with savon noir, black soap made from roasted cocoa and palm oil. As the small room fills with steam I can just see her outline as she scrubs and rolls my skin with coarse mittens until I&apos;m left pink, gleaming and slightly raw. The blissful massage that follows uses Thai stretching techniques, with thumbs concentrating on the spine and joints to boost circulation, and a Banyan Tree blend of lemongrass and lavender oils. I&apos;m brought round by the sound of a brass bell (to send away unwanted spirits, explains Khanittha) and sip ginger tea. It&apos;s all a far cry from my last visit to Marrakesh 15 years ago, when I slept in a VW camper van at the edge of town - long before the riad phenomenon exploded. Today there are at least 500 riad hotels in the old walled city alone, largely foreign-owned, and while locals may welcome the boost to the economy, they complain of inevitably inflated prices pushing them out. Abdelhai, my guide for the day, tells how his family sold its riad, in the centre of town, for \u20ac80,000 in 2001, only for it to be bought by foreigners for \u20ac1m a few months ago. &apos;You know,&apos; he says, &apos;the medina has actually been saved by foreigners&apos; money, but we&apos;re scared the whole city will be sold to them. The charm is seeing the little girl carrying bread to the bakery, the tradesman carrying out his craft, Moroccans living how they have for centuries - if they leave, Marrakesh will have died.&apos; The changes are very noticeable. A gleaming new airport terminal is nearly finished, the roads have improved, there are more tourists thanks to the arrival of the low-cost airlines, and a huge palm tree replanting project is under way in La Palmeraie, to the north of town. Azziz Mnii at the Moroccan Tourist Office in London tells me that much of Marrakesh is now cleaner than our capital: &apos;Our rubbish is collected every day, not every two weeks.&apos; It does seem much less dirty than I remember, while special tourist police have sliced the hassle factor right back. But in essence, the magic and mayhem of the &apos;Red City&apos; that has captured the hearts of artists from Matisse to McCartney, remains the same, and Abdelhai&apos;s fears of Marrakesh being turned into a tourist theme park seem exaggerated - at least for now.  Any trip ends up being about wandering, getting lost in the famously confusing, ochre medieval lanes, disappearing into the seething souks to be disgorged somewhere far from where you began. (Angsana provides guests with pre-set phones so those with no sense of direction can call their &apos;riad host&apos; and challenge him to find them.) At the centre of it all, the vast Djemaa el-Fna square may have cleaned up its act, but you&apos;ll still see plenty of bizarre sights, especially around dusk. I watch a man pull a baby bird of prey from his bag and make it ride on the back of a hedgehog, and another man perform a Houdini-style escapology act. There are snake charmers and acrobats and stalls selling food of all kinds. Despite being a tourist hot spot, it&apos;s where locals hang out too, gathering around storytellers, joining musicians for a song, eating with groups of friends. On the crossroads of ancient caravan routes from Timbuktu, Marrakesh has always been about trade - sub-Saharan merchants once carried gold, salt and slaves bound for Europe - and the city remains a huge shopping extravaganza. We haggle for spices, leather bags and carpets, and come home laden with far too many pairs of Moroccan slippers. Abdelhai takes us to his friend&apos;s shop, Tresor des Mille et Une Nuits, an Aladdin&apos;s cave of antiques and artefacts that is a favourite of celebs from Will Smith to Yves Saint Laurent. He proudly tells us how the owner, Said, turned down an offer of millions from Prince Johan of Sweden for the sprawling riad housing the shop.  If you don&apos;t want to be left to your own devices, the riads organise daily activities. At Riad Blanc we learn how to make local bread. Chef Aziza washes her hands in tea - it&apos;s better for the taste and smell of the bread, apparently - and shows us how it&apos;s done. Few homes have their own oven, so we follow Aziza to the neighbourhood furan (community oven) and wait with local women and children for the chance to bake our dough. Marrakesh isn&apos;t a city of big sights, but the riads organise city tours taking in the likes of Koutoubia Mosque and the Saadian Tombs, as well as day trips into the Atlas Mountains and beyond. But you can just stay put and enjoy your riad: there&apos;s all-day dining, featuring Thai and Moroccan fare, and each morning guests are asked if they&apos;d like to choose their evening meal, so the chef can shop for the freshest ingredients. You could dine at the lovely rooftop restaurant at Angsana&apos;s Riad Bab Firdaus, and across the city there are dozens of slick new restaurants and bars to try out. But, at the end of a day, slipping behind the door of your riad and relaxing on a rooftop under the stars is what Marrakesh is all about. Essentials The three-night Enchanting Escapes package at any of the Angsana riads costs from \u00a3518 for two in a superior room, including transfers, breakfast, a three-course dinner and a 60-minute spa treatment each. Call 020 3008 4875 or see angsana.com. Flights with GB Airways (gbairways.com) from London to Marrakesh start from \u00a3132 return.

Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh has been suspended for three Test matches on a charge of using a derogatory racial epithet against Andrew Symonds of Australia. And quite right too. Except that Harbhajan&apos;s apparent choice of insult is freighted with socio-linguistic complexity. He is alleged to have called Symonds a &quot;monkey&quot;, presumably a reference to the all-rounder&apos;s Afro-Caribbean heritage. The odd thing is, I&apos;ve heard the same word being used in a disparaging manner towards people of South Asian origin. I&apos;ve heard it from the mouths of white racists, but also from Indians describing other Indians, including Harbhajan&apos;s fellow Sikhs. Maybe he was reclaiming it, the way some rappers purport to reclaim &quot;the n-word&quot;. In fact, &quot;monkey&quot; operates as a one-size-fits-all term of abuse. In Thailand, I&apos;ve also heard it used as a generic insult by white people against all Thais, but also by Thai-Chinese people against ethnic Thais, and by ethnic Thais against Cambodians. And, to be fair, against people of African origin - witness this toothpaste commercial, depicting a black actor in the role of a coconut-picking simian. And, to even things up, I&apos;ve heard black Americans refer to Korean immigrants as &quot;rice monkeys&quot;, a distinction that helps to prevent confusion, if nothing else. I&apos;ve even been on the receiving end of it. I was in a gym in Bangkok, when the woman on the next treadmill suddenly began to point and laugh at me. &quot;You look like that monkey!&quot; she giggled, comparing my puce face to that of a bald uakari that was being featured on a nature programme above our heads. In retrospect, I could have accused her of racism - farang are more prone than Asians to flush under exertion - but I&apos;d like to think it wasn&apos;t meant that way. Those involved in the current spat down under are less laid-back: the Indian team is suspending its tour pending Harbhajan&apos;s appeal. The line between good-natured sledging and genuinely hurtful insults may sometimes be blurry, but offence seems to have been caused on both sides. But the question remains: can a word that can be applied to pretty much anyone, by anyone, from any ethnicity, really be called &quot;racist&quot; any more?", "publicationDate": "2008-01-07T11:00:00Z", "tags": ["Society", "Race issues", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/07/apingprejudice", "title": "Aping prejudice", "sentences": ["I was in a gym in Bangkok, when the woman on the next treadmill suddenly began to point and laugh at me."]}, {"article": "The wife of Thailand&apos;s ousted prime minister was arrested today when she returned to the country to face corruption charges. Pojamarn Shinawatra, wife of Thaksin Shinawatra, is accused of concealing millions of dollars in stock market shares. If convicted, she faces 28 years in prison, authorities said. Her sudden return to the country added to Thailand&apos;s political tensions. Her exiled husband is trying to form a coalition government after his party&apos;s victory in last month&apos;s general election, but he also faces the same corruption charges. He said he would follow her back to Thailand &quot;at an appropriate time&quot; to contest the allegations. &quot;I insist that my wife and I are ready to fight all charges to prove our innocence,&quot; he said in a statement issued by his lawyers. Thaksin, who was ousted in a September 2006 military coup for alleged corruption and abuse of power, said goodbye to his wife in Hong Kong. She received an arrest warrant at Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi international airport upon arrival and was taken to the supreme court, escorted by her legal team and police. The court released her on bail of 5m baht (\u00a3134,000) pending a hearing on January 23. She was banned from leaving the country and doing &quot;anything to obstruct the judicial process&quot;. She was then taken to the Department of Special Investigations and formally read charges in connection with a separate corruption case that alleges she and her husband concealed millions of dollars worth of shares in SC Asset, a real estate holding company owned by their family. The pair were charged with violating disclosure rules by failing to report ownership and failing to report the sale of shares to the stock exchange. The main case against Thaksin&apos;s wife involves the purchase in 2003 of prime Bangkok real estate from the Financial Institutions Development Fund, a state rescue fund directed by the central bank. An anti-corruption law bars prime ministers or their spouses from doing business with government agencies. The supreme court issued warrants in August against the couple on charges of conflict of interest and malfeasance. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Regarding the second charge, Sunai Manomaiudom, director-general of the investigations department, said Pojamarn Shinawatra faced eight years in prison and fines of 2m baht (\u00a334m) for failing to inform the stock market after a transaction that involved more than 5% of her holdings.", "publicationDate": "2008-01-08T10:43:29Z", "tags": ["World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/08/2", "title": "Thaksin's wife arrested on return to Thailand", "sentences": ["She received an arrest warrant at Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi international airport upon arrival and was taken to the supreme court, escorted by her legal team and police.", "The main case against Thaksin&apos;s wife involves the purchase in 2003 of prime Bangkok real estate from the Financial Institutions Development Fund, a state rescue fund directed by the central bank."]}, {"article": "The wife of the deposed Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra was arrested on corruption charges as she stepped off a plane from Hong Kong today. Pojaman Shinawatra, the former leader&apos;s trusted confidante and advisor, had signalled her intent to return. Immigration police served her with an arrest warrant at Bangkok international airport. Dressed in a sharp black suit and wearing sunglasses, the 51-year-old waved to the media and supporters as she was whisked into the supreme court, which released her on 6m baht (\u00a390,000) bail and ordered her to appear later this month. Thaksin, who remains in self-imposed exile outside the country and is charged with corruption over the same land deal, said in a statement that he intended to return to Thailand to clear his name. However, the 58-year-old billionaire tycoon - who bought Manchester City football club - added that he would wait for the political dust to settle following the victory of the People Power party (PPP) in last month&apos;s election that was a repudiation of the coup. The leaders of the PPP, which took on the political mantle of Thaksin&apos;s Thai Rak Thai (TRT) party, which was dissolved by the junta, remain in talks with smaller parties in an effort to stitch together a robust coalition. However, 65 of its 233 victorious candidates are under investigation and could be disqualified for electoral fraud. Pojaman said little in public while Thaksin was in office, but is regarded as an influential and astute political operator upon whom he often relied to sort out squabbles within the TRT. However, it was her extensive business dealings that led her to the courtroom today, where she was flanked by her three children and her lawyer, Nopodol Pattama. Last August, both she and Thaksin were charged, in their absence, with corruption over the purchase of a prime piece of Bangkok land from a government agency in 2003. Investigators allege that Pojaman used her husband&apos;s political influence to buy the land for one-third of its estimated value, contravening legislation barring officials and politicians from having business dealings with government agencies while in office. The couple also stand accused of failing to declare millions of pounds of shares assets to regulators. After her court appearance, Pojaman was taken to the special investigations unit at the justice ministry, where the charges were read, although no date was set for a hearing. If the couple are convicted on all the charges they are currently accused of, each faces up to 28 years in prison. Investigators are also said to be looking at a range of other corruption allegations. Pojaman had travelled in and out of Thailand until around six months ago when the charges were filed. By contrast, Thaksin stayed overseas, mainly in London, since the bloodless coup in September 2006. On his website, he again vowed to make a comeback, but did noy mention a timetable after having earlier promised an April return. &quot;I have long said that I will return to Thailand to prove my innocence and to fight for justice, but I do not want to trigger any conflicts that would worsen the situation,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I want to reassure you that when the appropriate time comes, I will return.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-01-08T11:45:57Z", "tags": ["World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/08/ianmackinnon", "title": "Ex-Thai PM's wife arrested in Bangkok", "sentences": ["Immigration police served her with an arrest warrant at Bangkok international airport.", "Last August, both she and Thaksin were charged, in their absence, with corruption over the purchase of a prime piece of Bangkok land from a government agency in 2003."]}, {"article": "Khunying Pojaman Shinawatra, the wife of Thailand&apos;s deposed prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, was arrested yesterday on corruption charges as she stepped off a plane from Hong Kong.

Type &quot;masseuse&quot; into the internet and a throng of possibilities appears, most of them with only the tenuous connections to massage. But this, with its high ceilings and its roaring fire, is clearly a respectable establishment. And when Katherine Hall arrives in a Shiatsu Society T-shirt, offering courteous greetings in a clipped home-counties accent, I feel ashamed to have harboured such schoolboyish ideas. &quot;Come through,&quot; she invites me, and leads the way into a small, softly lit room at the back of the building, where, beneath the gaze of an assortment of oriental ornaments and pictures, a futon and pillow are carefully laid out. &quot;All I need as a shiatsu practitioner are my pair of hands and my client,&quot; Hall says proudly. &quot;People can work on a couch, and I&apos;ve done work with people sitting on chairs - or with people who are really ill and in bed. But predominantly, 90% of the time, shiatsu is done on a futon on the floor.&quot; So what is all the equipment for, I ask, surveying the charts, balls and trinkets that line her shelves. &quot;They&apos;re not must-have parts of shiatsu,&quot; she says, adding that while she occasionally dabbles in acupuncture and ear-candling, most of the apparatus belongs to the other practitioners with whom she shares her room. She takes some rather medieval-looking smoked-glass globes out of a display cabinet. &quot;I don&apos;t use cupping, but that&apos;s what they are,&quot; she explains. &quot;Oh, and here&apos;s one for you ... erm.&quot; She struggles to remember the name of another obscure art. &quot;What do you call it? Pipes up the bottom ... Ah! Colonic irrigation! There&apos;s all sorts of different things going on here.&quot; With her jovial, no-nonsense attitude, Hall is very far from the hippy stereotype normally associated with complementary therapy. For her, the discovery of oriental medicine marked an abrupt departure from a very different life. In the early 1980s she was a successful designer of fashion books and magazines, and then suddenly and shockingly, her mother committed suicide. In the aftermath, she decided to go travelling, ostensibly to work on a project interviewing women around the world, but also so she could visit China - a country that had fascinated her ever since she glimpsed the hills of Guilin on a book cover that a colleague was working on. &quot;I saw that and something really appealed to me about it,&quot; she recalls with a faraway look in her eye. &quot;I don&apos;t know why, because I hadn&apos;t really thought about China before. I&apos;d certainly never read about it ... But something really connected with me, and I thought, wow!&quot; And when she did start to read about it, her fascination simply exploded. &quot;That rocked my boat,&quot; she says. &quot;Just looking at things from a very different point of view, from that more Taoist perspective of looking at emptiness and space. It took me off the rails of western thinking.&quot; In China, Hall learned tai chi, a martial art concerned with qi - a central concept in oriental medicine, loosely defined as a kind of spiritual energy. &quot;Then I studied Thai massage in Bangkok,&quot; she says with a grin, &quot;which is a good one for getting a lot of laughs.&quot; Contemplating her return, Hall already knew that life could never be the same again. &quot;During that time away,&quot; she says, &quot;I thought, I can&apos;t really see myself coming back to London and working in the fashion world and thinking about hemlines.&quot; When she did return, in fact, she suffered what she describes as &quot;a complete nervous breakdown&quot;, from which she emerged with the decision to train in the Japanese art shiatsu, a massage discipline similar to the &quot;tough tendon&quot; technique she practised in Thailand. &quot;I wanted to be doing something a bit more nitty-gritty,&quot; she says. And nitty-gritty was what she got. She left her Chelsea pad and moved to a flat in Brixton, and took on a job in a wholefood shop while studying shiatsu for two years. &quot;I guess I&apos;d always been quite a touchy-feely sort of person,&quot; she says when I ask if learning to work with the human body was a difficult transition. &quot;I&apos;d been quite at peace with my own body, so it wasn&apos;t something I felt intimidated by doing. And maybe because of being reasonably relaxed myself it wasn&apos;t intimidating for other people.&quot; It also helped, no doubt, that in shiatsu massage, the client&apos;s body need not be naked. &quot;I keep people with their clothes on, which is very nice,&quot; Hall explains. &quot;It&apos;s not lots of hairy backs and stuff like that. Actually it doesn&apos;t really matter if people have got clothes on, because I can still feel what I need to feel through them. There&apos;s quite a lot of movement - rotations and stretches - so being naked isn&apos;t very dignified.&quot; A great deal of Hall&apos;s work, moreover, does not involve touching her clients at all. In fact, it begins the moment that they walk through the door. &quot;You&apos;re learning to observe,&quot; she explains, &quot;look at people, smell people, watch the way they move, and then diagnose from the energy perspective.&quot; This diagnosis takes the form of a short conversation to assess the client&apos;s physical problems and their emotional state. Hall then uses her training to assess which parts of the person&apos;s body she ought to focus on. &quot;If they have got sciatica, for example,&quot; she says, &quot;I will be thinking, maybe this is to do with the bladder meridian ... But if they&apos;re talking about just being bereaved I might look at the lungs and large intestine meridians.&quot; This consultation usually takes up the first quarter of a one-hour session. &quot;Then they lie down,&quot; Hall continues, getting on to the futon herself, &quot;and I&apos;m observing how they lie down - is it open, is it a bit floppy, is it on one side? And then I do the hara [stomach and abdominal area]. Then it&apos;s kind of a mixture between palming, maybe working with rotations and stretches, and working the meridian lines and points for specific problems.&quot; She gracefully demonstrates some simple leg extensions before climbing back into her seat. It looks like a pleasant, but quite physical experience. To many people, of course, talk of &quot;energy&quot; and &quot;meridian lines&quot; will sound like hokum, but Hall believes it utterly. She does accept, however, that some of the more mystical elements of her work will not be everyone&apos;s cup of tea. &quot;It&apos;s part of the training for a shiatsu practitioner,&quot; she says, &quot;to gauge what feels appropriate for somebody, and not to go into working on the more spiritual points, perhaps, when someone comes for just a cricked neck. There&apos;s a lot of theory with shiatsu, but I think on a really elementary basic level, a major part of the treatment is just quietly being present and really listening to somebody&apos;s life.&quot; In the process, Hall gets to talk to some quite interesting people. Among her clients, for instance, whom she sees both in Harley Street and near her home in Northamptonshire, are a life coach, an 80-year-old former City gent and a retired headteacher. Through the charity Mind, she treats some people with serious mental health problems - often heavily medicated. Besides this, Hall brings in extra money teaching and doing corporate jobs - providing &quot;energy workshops&quot; for companies such as Accenture. Nevertheless, because shiatsu massage is not offered by most health insurers and is only very rarely available on the NHS, she has really had to learn to hustle to make ends meet. &quot;I do all sorts of different bits and pieces as I attempt to keep the wolf from the door,&quot; she says. &quot;There&apos;s no real guaranteed income, there&apos;s no career ladder. You&apos;re very much out on your own.&quot; For all that, at the age of 44 and after 16 years in the business, Hall has finally been able to chisel out the life she wants for herself, leaving plenty of time to spend with her dog and her garden. She works roughly five hours a day, earning up to \u00a316,000 a year. Enough, just about, for her to live on. With trepidation, I admit that I have a final question to ask. It seems silly, but I want to know. Do people, how can I put it, ever get the wrong idea about what she does? &quot;Oh God!&quot; she recognises this territory. &quot;It&apos;s not been a problem. I have had one or two phone calls, especially when I first started, from gentlemen.&quot; She speaks the word satirically, with excessive refinement. &quot;Sort of saying, &apos;Um yes, well I saw your card.&apos; You can tell within two seconds if it&apos;s a dodgy phone call. And they&apos;ll say, &apos;Do you do any um ...&apos; And being an evil person I&apos;ll say, &apos;Do I do any um?&apos;&quot; She grins. &quot;I&apos;ve never had anybody actually come in who is after &apos;extras&apos; or &apos;finishing off&apos; or anything like that.&quot; Now she laughs out loud. &quot;I think being clothed may help.&quot; Curriculum vitae Current position Shiatsu practitioner and teacher Qualifications Member of the professional register of the Shiatsu Society (MRSS) Salary Up to \u00a316,000 a year  Hours Flexible.

Karen Guthrie (left) and Nina Pope (right) I didn&apos;t just admire the winner of the new Northern Art Prize last night. I ate it. Part of the richly complex installation by Karen Guthrie and Nina Pope which won the award was a market stall of Lake District produce on a ceremonial Japanese table, along with secretly-taken film of a Cumbrian shoe factory called Bata-ville: We Are Not Afraid of the Future.  The theory behind it is imaginative and, along with the craftsmanship, deserves the prize, but the practical side is that you can buy the produce. I bought some onions pickled by Nina&apos;s mother-in-law for \u00a31.50. The two I ate with a pint at the Vic &apos;round the back of Leeds Art Gallery were lovely. The price per jar is exactly one thousandth of the \u00a315,000 prize money, which the two Royal College of Art graduates now have in the bank. This being Yorkshire, at the ceremony where Turner Prize winner Martin Creed announced the result, the guests were naturally discussing whether the viewing public has got its money&apos;s worth. What with abstract photographs by Tim Brennan and severely lifeless mountain scenes by Dan Holdsworth, some of the canap\u00e9-browsers were grumpy. What finished it for Andrew Wade, a Bradford solicitor who organises the Leeds Art Fair and is a talented painter himself, was Eric Bainbridge&apos;s skeletal installation with a winking light bulb, New Modernism Post-Bangkok. &quot;Pretentious, self-indulgent crap,&quot; snorted Andrew. I put this to Ben Read, lecturer in fine art at Leeds University and shepherd of those naughty students who hoodwinked the media five years ago by pretending they&apos;d gone to a Spanish beach at public expense to set up a similar installation (It was actually near Scarborough). Ben, beaming like the Mona Lisa, declined to comment. But the spiritual eye of his celebrated poet and anarchist Dad, Sir Herbert the critic, will be twinkling, I think. Read senior, from a farming family in Kirkbymoorside, was a formidable patron of Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth at a time when &quot;self-indulgent crap&quot; was one of the politer descriptions of their work. The new prize hopes to stimulate lots of successors to Moore and Hepworth (and the likes of Hockney and Hirst), and above all, to try to tempt them to stay and not be lured to London. You can judge for yourself at Leeds Art Gallery until February 10, though Nina says that she may raise the price of the pickled onions now that Bata-ville is a prizewinner.

David Learmount, the award-winning operations and safety editor of Flight International and a former RAF pilot, said that there were a number of potential causes, some of which could be immediately ruled out. He said that a bird strike seemed unlikely as there were no remains of dead birds on the fuselage or windscreen. Fuel contamination was also a possibility, he said. As an aircraft came into land, fuel would be low and therefore a potential contaminant would have greater effect. &quot;There is also a possibility of some maintenance error but that would normally have become apparent very early in the flight,&quot; he said. &quot;But every time you get a theory, you can shoot it out of the sky.&quot; He discounted one theory: &quot;Lack of fuel - forget it.&quot; The crew would have noted and declared this, he said. A similar incident involving a Qantas jumbo jet carrying 344 passengers took place at Bangkok airport less than two weeks ago, on January 9. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said at the time that it had been told the power from the main generators was lost 15 minutes from Bangkok and the pilot had to switch to battery back-ups for the landing, which was carried out safely. At the time this was blamed on a possible leakage of water from the galley that had affected power. Peter Gibson of the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority told ABC News that such a problem was &quot;very, very rare&quot;. Other recent accidents have had a variety of causes. \u00b7 Last September, 88 passengers were killed when a budget Thai airplane crashed on landing at Phuket airport in Thailand. The plane, a McDonnell Douglas MD-82, split in two as it crashed when a very heavy storm apparently caused the pilot to veer into an embankment. \u00b7 Last July, an Airbus-32 crashed at Sao Paulo&apos;s Congonhas airport and ploughed across the road before crashing into a petrol station and catching fire. All 180 on board died. At the time, the short length of the runway was blamed as a contributory factor. \u00b7 A Russian airliner that fell out of the sky in August 2006 was thought to have been hit by lightning. There were no survivors among the 170 on board. Technical failure is given as the reason for 20% of air accidents, according to the Aircraft Crashes Record Office in Geneva. Human error is listed as the principal cause, being responsible for 68% of crashes, whether through navigational error, maintenance failure, illness or other human errors. Weather (6%) and sabotage (3%) are the other main reasons listed. Of the other causes, some remain unknown and are regarded as &quot;freak&quot; accidents. Fifty-one per cent of crashes take place during landing, 28% during flight and 21% during take-off. A British Airline Pilots&apos; Association survey last summer found that around 80% of pilots admitted to having been affected by fatigue while flying and 12% said they were prepared to continue flying without reporting their fatigue, although this is not seen as a factor in Thursday&apos;s accident.  There was another related crash yesterday, although not one with serious consequences. The website used by pilots and aircraft personnel to discuss theories on incidents and pass on information and gossip, pprune.org (the professional pilots rumour network), went down under the sheer weight of would-be users yesterday.", "publicationDate": "2008-01-19T23:46:21Z", "tags": ["UK news", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jan/19/world.uknews4", "title": "What downed flight BA 038?

The error has been corrected.    After last week&apos;s near-disaster when one of the world&apos;s safest airliners, a Boeing 777 belonging to British Airways, crash landed at Heathrow, you may be worried. But consider this exchange from Rain Man. Tom Cruise says to Dustin Hoffman: &quot;All airlines have crashed at one time or another. That doesn&apos;t mean they aren&apos;t safe.&quot; &quot;Qantas,&quot; Hoffman replies. &quot;Qantas never crashed.&quot; That isn&apos;t quite right: the 87-year-old Australian airline suffered several fatal crashes in its early days, most involving biplanes or flying boats. That fact may not have reassured flight QF2&apos;s 343 passengers travelling from London to Sydney earlier this month when the Boeing 747 lost power from all four generators minutes from Bangkok, forcing the pilot to switch to battery back-up for landing. Qantas remains the safest airline if one measures safety according to the number of miles a carrier has flown without fatal accident. That said, hundreds of airlines - including easyJet and Virgin Atlantic - have suffered no fatal crashes (full list at www.airsafe.com/events/nofatals.htm).

They just argue.&quot; The seething flight attendants also maintained that the soap - with its tales of jealousy, revenge and fisticuffs - would turn off young Thais with aspirations to join the profession. &quot;My daughter watched the show and has started to look down on my job,&quot; said Pichitra Taveerat, a flight attendant. &quot;She asked me: &apos;Is it true that everyone at your job is fighting over guys?&apos; I didn&apos;t know how to answer.&quot; A culture ministry spokesman said he could not comment on the protest as officials had yet to see the nature of the cabin crew&apos;s complaints about the programme on Thailand&apos;s Channel 5. But the broadcaster said it had no plans to withdraw the popular soap with four more episodes due to screen this week.

Pojamarn Shinawatra made the statement as she pleaded not guilty to corruption charges before the supreme court. During the brief first hearing, she pleaded not guilty and asked the court for 90 days in which to prepare documents and witnesses for her defence. A court statement also said that her husband would return in May to fight the same charges. Pojamarn is accused of using her husband&apos;s political influence to buy Bangkok property from a government agency at a third of its estimated value. Thaksin, the owner of Manchester City football club, who lives mostly in London, has given several different dates for his return home. Most recently he said he was &quot;considering&quot; returning in April. Speculation is rife that he has been trying to forge secret deals with the military and the royalist establishment through his wife to pave the way for his return. Thai newspapers have suggested that Pojamarn has already met top military brass and the chief royal adviser, Prem Tinsulanonda, accused by her husband&apos;s supporters of being the mastermind of the 2006 coup. &quot;There will be a wholesale effort to wipe the target clean, to allow Thaksin and Pojamarn to get off,&quot; the Chulalongkorn university political scientist, Thitinan Pongsudhirak, told Reuters. &quot;If the trial had started last year, there might have been people willing to testify against them, but in the next three months, I doubt it.&quot; The charges were the result of an investigation by a panel appointed by the coup-making generals and stemmed from Pojamarn&apos;s purchase of a valuable property in downtown Bangkok, owned by the central bank, at an auction where other bidders backed out. Thaksin&apos;s comeback seems increasingly likely after his supporters in the People Power Party (PPP) formed a coalition government following their victory in general elections last month. The election results were seen as a public repudiation of the coup and criticism of the military has become sharper. Pro-Thaksin stalwart Samak Sundaravej is expected to be named prime minister on Friday amid opposition from the military and anti-Thaksin activists who led mass demonstrations prior to the coup.", "publicationDate": "2008-01-23T13:13:31Z", "tags": ["World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/23/marktran", "title": "Thaksin will return to Thailand in May, wife claims", "sentences": ["Pojamarn is accused of using her husband&apos;s political influence to buy Bangkok property from a government agency at a third of its estimated value.", "&quot;If the trial had started last year, there might have been people willing to testify against them, but in the next three months, I doubt it.&quot; The charges were the result of an investigation by a panel appointed by the coup-making generals and stemmed from Pojamarn&apos;s purchase of a valuable property in downtown Bangkok, owned by the central bank, at an auction where other bidders backed out."]}, {"article": "It was a long shot ... pointing to the lifeless plant on the pharmacy counter and imitating pouring water into it and miming a recovering plant and then pointing to myself. But it got me my rehydration sachets.  Removed from the comfort zone of effortless communication using their native language, lots of travellers freeze or start shouting. Or they&apos;ll head overseas armed with a little phrasebook and join tours with English-speaking guides. Deaf travellers go equipped with a lifetime&apos;s experience of finding creative solutions to communication obstacles. Having been born deaf, dealing with this has become part of my daily life to the point that I don&apos;t even notice it now. And it comes in very handy when travelling. Coupled with attitudes towards deafness around the world, that are, let us say, interesting, it ensures lots of memorable experiences. In places where politically correct language and attitudes haven&apos;t arrived, people are free to describe deafness in gloriously insulting ways. Like the leather goods seller who ran up to me and my friend in Djemma el-Fna in Marrakech, saying his brother &quot;was, was, was ...&quot; - he was clearly searching for a word that would convey &quot;deaf&quot;. We waited with anticipation, what would he come up with? Eventually, he gave up and enthusiastically mimed chopping off his tongue, then was delighted when we pointed at our ears and nodded in agreement. From Hanoi all the way south to Saigon, locals used goldfish-like mouth movements accompanied with raised eyebrows and questioning expressions to symbolise deafness. But, you know what? Give me that any day over the phrases considered PC here in Britain: &quot;hearing challenged&quot; or &quot;hearing impaired&quot;, to skirt around the fact that I am, at the end of the day, bloody deaf. In the supposedly &quot;backward&quot; cultures of the developing world, people point and gesture. &quot;You deaf?&quot; Then they shrug in mild interest or laugh and elbow each other in fascination. Either way, they never seem to recede in awkwardness or embarrassment; rather than stumbling around the elephant in the room, they&apos;re prodding it, feeding it ... I love every bit of it.  In western cultures, where showing undue interest in someone&apos;s personal life is held to be impolite, people can feel it&apos;s off limits to ask me about being deaf, hovering round the issue and hushing their five-year-old for asking what they, too, want to know. Not so in places where people wear curiosity on their sleeve. During my travels in Asia and North Africa, I&apos;ve had plenty of people walk up and ask why my voice sounds funny, followed by a long interrogation on what it&apos;s like to be deaf. And my hearing aids are a source of fascination abroad. When a bunch of kids in Angkor Wat in Cambodia saw them, they abandoned their hard-sell hawking of souvenirs and told me to take them off so they could have a look. They each took their time examining the small brown contraptions before unleashing a flurry of questions: what were they for, what could I hear with or without them, why did I speak funny (again)? But this gave me an opening to find out about their lives: I could ask them about working, whether they went to school, their families. As I prepared to set off on my bike, one of them gave me a bracelet, refusing payment because I was her friend. One advantage of being deaf is that it can set you apart from the zillions of backpackers passing through tourist-weary countries, and locals take an interest in you. No common spoken language? Pas de probl\u00e8me. Deaf travellers use gesture and body language. A friend and I picked up a hitchhiker in the Moroccan countryside who brought the goat she had cleverly hidden behind a rock into our car and later ordered us to help her carry bags of goat feed from the car to her house. In return we were invited in and after we forced down some bread with goat&apos;s butter washed down with goat&apos;s milk followed by goat&apos;s yoghurt for dessert, we sat back for a chat over mint tea with several shovels of sugar. She told us all about her children and their families, her upbringing, the royal wedding being shown on TV. We told her how we knew each other and about our travels. Not a word of English was uttered. Using one&apos;s body and face to communicate can also have financial uses: I&apos;ve managed to haggle speeding fines down to a quarter of the going rate on various occasions.  The attitudes abroad have taught me a lot too. We have all kinds of equality laws here in Europe. The government-funded access-to-work package ensures that deaf people have minicoms, interpreters and other resources in the workplace. All of which is vital to equality, no doubt. But in Bangkok I met many deaf people working on stalls. Vibrant body communication and a calculator was their only means of &quot;access&quot;, yet they went at their jobs with gusto, one woman telling me and my friends to &quot;Wait, wait, wait&quot; so she could go off and snare two American tourists and sell them all kinds of things they obviously hadn&apos;t intended buying. Would government funding for an interpreter have helped her? Hu\u00e9 in North Vietnam has three restaurants clustered together all run by deaf men who compete viciously for customers. With their mention in the Lonely Planet, all three restaurants were bustling when I went - this in a country light years away from equality law. It&apos;s a good reminder that while there&apos;s more to be done to ensure deaf people enjoy equality, most of it is down to the right frame of mind.

Top of my list is The Yacoubian Building by Alaa Al Aswamy (Harper Perennial). The book has been a best seller in its native Egypt and throughout the Arabic world since publication in 2002. Set in downtown Cairo at the time of the 1990 Gulf War, it reveals modern Egyptian life through the eyes of a diverse range of characters \u2013 an aristocratic playboy, a gay newspaper editor, a religious zealot, childhood sweethearts \u2013 all of whom live in the same apartment building. Cairo hasn&apos;t been so vividly - or sexily - evoked since Naguib Mahfouz&apos;s Palace Walk.  Barcelona broods in Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n&apos;s The Shadow of the Wind (Phoenix). Ashen morning skies cloak the city &quot;in a wreath of liquid copper&quot;. On the narrow streets night watchmen linger as &quot;the brightness of dawn filtered down from the balconies and cornices in streaks of slanting light that dissolved before touching the ground&quot;. Part thriller, part Gothic melodrama, part coming-of-age romance, The Shadow of the Wind brings Barcelona to life in the years after the Spanish Civil War. You won&apos;t find Mark Anthony Jarman&apos;s Canada in the travel brochures, and more&apos;s the pity. His 19 Knives (House of Anansi Press) includes not only the best story I&apos;ve read in a year, but one of the best ever written. Rejecting post-modern cynicism, Jarman celebrates life&apos;s ecstatic mysteries alongside its trivialities. The result is hypnotic, crazy, seductive and darkly funny. Smoky bars. A freaky house fire. A cougar attack. A pointless argument in a parking lot. Sublime. Jarman joins the ranks of Canada&apos;s finest storytellers: Munro, Gallant, MacLeod and Atwood. Berlin cast a spell over me long before my first visit, and Thomas Brussig&apos;s Heroes Like Us (Harvill) takes one laughing and weeping through the last decades of the Cold War. The central character is the teenage fantasist (and would-be Nobel laureate), born on the day Soviet tanks rumbled into Prague, responsible alone for breaching the Berlin Wall. Think Goodbye Lenin (with bonking) rather than The Lives of Others. Ian Rankin&apos;s Rebus novels spawned a dozen crime tours in Edinburgh, as do Donna Leon&apos;s in Venice. Any day now the first long boats will rip along the klongs in search of John Burdett&apos;s Bangkok. His three compelling detective yarns unfold in the city&apos;s underbelly. In Bangkok 8 (Corgi), a visiting US marine sergeant is killed inside a locked Mercedes by a maddened python and a swarm of cobras. His other titles feature a Kalashnikov-toting monk, a pre-op transsexual and a troop of demonic hookers. This is surreal Thailand where a devout Buddhist cop, speaking slick Chandler-eze, avenges the death of his partner and soul brother. Bangkok, man? &quot;Great city, lousy traffic.&quot; Finally, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie&apos;s outstanding Half a Yellow Sun (Harper Perennial). Through the lives and loves of her characters, Adichie tells the story of the catastrophic Nigerian-Biafra War of 1967-1970: starvation, colonialist arrogance, international realpolitik and ethnic division. Here are haunting, &quot;real&quot; stories from Lagos, Nsukka, bush villages and battlefields. &quot;Olana jumped each time she heard the thunder. She imagined another air raid, bombs rolling out of the plane and exploding in the compound \u2026 sometimes she imagined the bunker itself collapsing, squashing them all into the mud.&quot; A haunting, compassionate, transformative novel that reveals a world that no tour bus will ever guide us to. \u00b7 Rory MacLean&apos;s latest book Magic Bus: On the Hippie Trail from Istanbul to India is published by Penguin.

It is the constituency of Americans abroad and last night they were voting in their hundreds of thousands from Tokyo to Berlin and from central Jakarta to chilly Paddington. &quot;I&apos;ve never seen so much activity,&quot; said Daniel Rivkin of Democrats Abroad UK before voting started at Porchester Hall in central London, which had been hired for the occasion. &quot;Our membership has doubled in the last month. We have two great candidates whose supporters are very passionate and people feel that anything could happen. It reflects what is happening in the United States.&quot; Rivkin said a new president could help to improve relations between the US and the rest of the world which had been damaged by the Iraq war. Rivkin, who has lived abroad for 17 years in Paris, Brussels and London, where he has worked until recently for Reuters, said the interest this year was unprecedented in his experience and he was expecting a record turnout. &quot;It is a historic election,&quot; agreed Bill Bernard, the chairman of Democrats Abroad UK, who lives in Oxford, where people will also be able to vote. He also has never seen such interest in the outcome. At Porchester Hall dozens of supporters of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were gathered outside wearing campaign T-shirts and carrying placards. Inside was a sea of red, white and blue. A Clinton supporter, Ellen McCoy from Washington DC, said: &quot;There has been a huge effort to get the vote out. This time we&apos;ve got to get a Democrat elected.&quot; Karin Robinson who has lived in England for nine years, said she was backing Obama and that there was much more interest in the primaries than before. &quot;This is a million miles from where we were four years ago,&quot; she said. &quot;We would like the country to be led by Democrats&apos; Democrats Abroad has committees throughout Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and the antipodes and is recognised as a &quot;state&quot; party. It will have 22 delegates at the party&apos;s convention in Denver in August and was host to 76 voting events in 33 countries last night. Organisers estimated that voter participation had increased around seven-fold from the rather lacklustre primaries in 2004, which heralded a disastrous showing by the Democrats in the November election. In London, Republicans Abroad have a different set-up from the Democrats and were not casting ballots. They gathered instead at Henry&apos;s in Covent Garden for a social evening. &quot;We have supporters of both [Mitt] Romney and [John] McCain,&quot; said Miki Bowman, who chairs Republicans Abroad. She said that they were conducting an online straw poll to see how their members intended to vote. The United Kingdom has one of the largest concentrations of Americans abroad - an estimated 250,000 to 300,000. Both parties value their support, not least as fundraising bases. The first of the American expats to participate voted at a hotel in Jakarta. Throughout the day and night countless others were dropping their ballots in or watching events unfold on television in bars and pubs from Dublin to Sydney. Jakarta sent Obama into an early lead, if only for a few minutes, with around 75% of the first 100 votes cast, three times what Clinton was receiving.

The cafe, known for late-night dancing and chocolate baklava, is a 10-minute walk from the Harvard campus, where I spent the better part of my 20s trying to be an academic. I am with my partner, Roland, and our friend, David, and we&apos;re here to volunteer for Barack Obama. It&apos;s a Sunday, so the team leaders tell us we should join the visibility campaign, which means standing on a street corner with placards. &quot;For people on their way to church,&quot; they explain. David says we&apos;ve been given the street corner because Roland has forgotten to shave. &quot;Who would answer the door for a homeless white man and two dodgy looking immigrants?&quot; The team leader instructs us to tell people why we are out campaigning in the cold on a Sunday morning - which makes me wonder why indeed I am. I was born in Bangladesh, but raised in Paris, New York and Bangkok, and I now live in London. I&apos;m not even a US citizen. Nor am I a campaign addict. I have never campaigned for any Bangladeshi candidate. I have never asked anyone for their time, their attention, their vote. But here I am, on the corner of Prospect and Mass Ave, cheering for a man who will never be my president. It&apos;s very cold. I have forgotten my gloves, so I stuff my hands into my pockets and try to balance the placard against my elbow. The other Obama supporters are mostly students, and mostly white, with the exception of an older man in a beret, and Sally, who tells us she has been picketing in some form or another since Bush&apos;s first inauguration. By 10.30am, we are blowing on our hands and wiggling our feet. A man in pyjamas and flip-flops approaches on a bicycle. &quot;I have some questions,&quot; he says. &quot;I supported Kucinich, then Edwards, and now I&apos;m not sure whether to vote for Hillary or Obama.&quot; We begin to talk about electability, about healthcare, about Iraq. I am particularly pleased to relay the brilliant one-liner that Obama delivered in the last debate - &quot;the next president of the United States doesn&apos;t just have to be ready on day one, he also has to be right&quot;. As we speak, I notice the man&apos;s pyjamas are adorned with very small puppies, some of which are dressed as Santa Claus. &quot;All right,&quot; the pyjama man says, &quot;you&apos;ve got my vote.&quot; He cycles away, and we congratulate ourselves on a successful conversion. Our next stop is a housing project in East Cambridge, mostly inhabited by African-Americans and new immigrants. Many of them are already staunch Obama supporters. David corners a man named &quot;Junior&quot;. Roland finds a Chinese couple and puts his Mandarin to use. I see an Asian woman crossing the playground with a baby on her hip. Something about the way she has draped the cloth around her head makes me ask if she is from Bangladesh. She says yes, but she&apos;s not a citizen, though her husband is. &quot;Tell your husband to vote,&quot; I say to her. &quot;Obama is the son of an immigrant just like you.&quot; About halfway through the day, I forget I&apos;m not a citizen. I&apos;m talking about &quot;our next president&quot; as though the changes in the system are actually going to affect me. It&apos;s not just because the next president of the United States is indeed in some significant way my president - because if he doesn&apos;t lower the carbon emissions Bangladesh is going to drown, because if he invades Iran he may invade Bangladesh next, because our currency is pegged to the dollar - but because, somehow, I feel that the death of idealism in this country would mean the death of idealism everywhere in the world. This doesn&apos;t really feel like a national election: it feels as if something more than the fate of this nation is at stake. I replace the hopes for my own democracy with the hopes for this democracy, as though somehow one will enable the other. Perhaps this is the enduring power of America - the power to shape our collective imagination and show us what is possible. I&apos;ve been on a book tour for the past month. In Seattle, I was approached by a vaguely familiar woman. &quot;Cynthia Nevins,&quot; she said, and I realised with a start that she was my fifth-grade teacher. It was 1985, and my father, a United Nations diplomat, had just been posted to Bangkok. Moving to Thailand was a particularly difficult transition for me - I remember spending most of the school day listening to my mother&apos;s exercise tapes on my Walkman. Cynthia Nevins had obviously not forgotten this because she regarded me with a kind of tenderness that one usually reserves for slightly disoriented children. I was delighted to see her, but also a little worried that she would remind me of some embarrassing episode from my childhood. Thankfully, aside from a small story about my unfortunate choice of clothing, she refrained, and mostly she seemed proud. A few days later, in Toronto, I met my old friend Derek McKee, who reminded me that in high school we were known as the Nerd Herd. Really? I&apos;m positively thrilled. The thing about having an itinerant childhood is that various parts of my life now reside in places other than my own memory. So I need occasional reminders that, in the fifth grade, for example, I sported a T-shirt with a drawing of a cat and the caption &quot;I&apos;m Lonesome&quot; (what was my mother thinking?); but that, several years later, I found my tribe. \u00b7 This week Tahmima watched There Will Be Blood: &quot;As advertised, it sported vast quantities of blood and a virtuoso performance by Daniel Day-Lewis.&quot; Tahmima read The Invention of Everything Else, by Samantha Hunt: &quot;A brilliant evocation of the life of the inventor Nikola Tesla, an Austrian-born Serb who later became an American citizen.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-02-07T15:16:25Z", "tags": ["US elections 2008", "World news", "US politics"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/07/uselections2008.world", "title": "Tahmima Anam: He'll never be my president, but I still found myself campaigning for Obama", "sentences": ["I was born in Bangladesh, but raised in Paris, New York and Bangkok, and I now live in London.", "It was 1985, and my father, a United Nations diplomat, had just been posted to Bangkok."]}, {"article": "ENGLAND&apos;S PREMIER LEAGUE ON TOUR Due to an &quot;incident&quot; involving some stolen plutonium, a pair of chippy Libyan terrorists and a DeLorean we hot-wired on Big Road this lunchtime, today&apos;s Fiver is being written in the future. It&apos;s January 6 2011 and we&apos;re in Bangkok, where hundreds of thousands of excited locals clad in English Football world tour T-shirts and Colchester United replica jersies are lining the streets, hoping to catch a glimpse of their heroes - Premier League superstars such as Clive Platt and Kevin Lisbie, who are currently on board a coach inching its way towards the Rajamangala National Stadium for a relegation six-pointer with Alan Shearer&apos;s Premier League propper-uppers Newcastle United. The &quot;House Full&quot; signs are up, hysteria reigns. Seeing how welcome both teams are being made, the Fiver feels even more stupid than usual. Back in February 2008, when the Premier League announced its proposal to add an extra round of lucrative overseas fixtures to its season, we gasped at its avarice and doubted its civic-minded motives (some cant about using football as &quot;a development tool&quot; and ploughing &quot;some&quot; of the income generated back into the domestic game at grassroots). &quot;If nobody in Wigan is interested in going to watch Wigan play Bongo FC, then who in Miami or Beijing is going to want to watch them play?&quot; we&apos;d written acerbically, unaware at the time of how ridiculously moot that particular concern would be in 2011. The Premier League proposals were simple: seed the top five teams to keep them apart, draw the other 15 from the Premier League fez then send each group of four teams romping and roasting their way to a foreign city which would stage two Premier League fixtures. The downside? Some poor team of also-rans - Bolton, Reading or Liverpool, for example - would be forced to play Manchester United, Arsenal or Chelsea three times in a season: home, away and even further away. The upside? Deprived peasants in Rio might get the chance to see some proper football for a change: Fulham and Middlesbrough grinding out a scoreless draw in front of 15 ball-boys at the Maracana.

Ministers will not at this stage oppose the audacious proposal to extend the season from 38 games to 39 to allow every club to play one extra match abroad every year, but they are not convinced that the move is in football&apos;s best interests and there are concerns around supporters, sporting integrity and the impact upon other national leagues and competitions. The league and the chairmen of its 20 clubs unanimously agreed to further explore the proposal in London today, and the FA has also reacted positively to the move having been briefed before this morning&apos;s meeting. Should the deal go ahead, the 10 overseas games are expected to take place in January providing space can be found in the calendar, with points awarded for the extra match in the normal way. The top five sides are likely to be seeded so that they do not meet each other, but otherwise the fixtures will be drawn out of a hat and played in cities around the world. &quot;The international round is an exciting and innovative proposal that needs careful consideration before being introduced,&quot; said the Premier League&apos;s chief executive, Richard Scudamore. &quot;However, this concept recognises the truly global appeal of the Barclays Premier League while understanding that the traditions of the English game have always underpinned our success. &quot;We believe that an international round of matches will enhance the strength of the Premier League as a competition; create extra interest in all 20 Premier League clubs at home and abroad; and allow increased investment in talent development and acquisition, facilities, as well as our football development and community programmes. The globalisation of sport is both an opportunity and a challenge; one that needs addressing in a responsible way. We are a better competition for being a cosmopolitan league and have benefitted from our increased international reach. None the less, it is critical we retain our English character by improving our efforts to produce homegrown talent, deepening our commitment to community engagement and continuing our investment in the grassroots.&quot; The league appears intent on trying to appease supporters by extending the season rather than reducing the number of games in England, but there is certain to be a degree of anger among fans at matches being played away from domestic grounds. &quot;We challenge the Premier League to scrap these plans if the majority of football fans in this country don&apos;t want matches to be played abroad,&quot; the Football Supporters&apos; Federation chairman, Malcolm Clarke, said. &quot;The FSF has no doubt whatsoever that the vast majority of supporters are against this, and believe it would drag the Premier League into the realms of farce. When this ludicrous idea was first mooted in October last year, we ran a poll here on our website and a huge majority of supporters - 80% who took the trouble to vote - were in complete opposition to this. &quot;Are we going to see local derbies played in a foreign country thousands of miles away? Are supporters supposed to accept missing the biggest games of their season because it&apos;s being played on the other side of the planet? Let&apos;s face facts, the sole motivation for this is the Premier League to make more money - aren&apos;t they making enough already? This displays a complete disregard for the proud traditions of the English game as well as a crass lack of consideration for football supporters in general.&quot; The FA backed the proposal in a statement this afternoon, but will ensure the overseas matches would not impact on Cup or England games. &quot;We understand the Premier League&apos;s desire to raise interest in English football around the world,&quot; read the statement. &quot;We look forward to discussing the detail with the league and looking carefully at the implications, to ensure that the proposal fits well alongside the existing fixture list, including our domestic cup and league competitions and our national team games. We know that the Premier League are equally conscious of these issues.&quot; Bangkok, Beijing, Hong Kong, Melbourne, Miami and Shanghai are among potential venues for the first scheduled matches in 2011, while other cities will bid for the right to stage games in following seasons. Five cities would be chosen each year, with each venue hosting matches on consecutive days. A certain number of games are likely to be played in third world nations, with the Premier League keen to use football as a development tool. Cities will also be asked to auction for the TV rights for the games, with the initiative not starting until the current TV deal expires in 2011. Commercially the opportunities for the Premier League are enormous - its income from the sale of overseas TV rights has already increased from \u00a3178m in 2001 to \u00a3625m for the current deal, while an estimated 1 billion people around the world watched Arsenal&apos;s match with Manchester United last November. The majority of Premier League clubs already embark on annual pre-season overseas tours to tap into burgeoning markets such as south-east Asia, the Middle East and the United States. With the influx of foreign businessmen to the Premier League - nine top-flight clubs are owned by overseas owners, including Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea - it has long been thought that league matches would eventually be taken outside England. The league is following the example of the top American leagues, the NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB, the first three having all staged games in London last October, the latter having previously played regular-season baseball games in Tokyo. Before this year&apos;s Super Bowl, the NFL commissioner Roger Goodell approved a plan to host a game in the UK every year until 2010, and confirmed that the Buffalo Bills would be playing an annual regular season game in Toronto from next season. There is a lot of speculation about the NFL&apos;s long-term plans for expansion abroad, but in particular there have been whispers that the NFL may be considering expanding to a 17-game season, in which every team plays eight home games and eight away games (as they do now), and then one extra game outside of the United States, with obvious similarities to the Premier League&apos;s proposal.", "publicationDate": "2008-02-07T18:05:31Z", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/07/newsstory.premierleague", "title": "Football: Premier League to go global with overseas matches", "sentences": ["We know that the Premier League are equally conscious of these issues.&quot; Bangkok, Beijing, Hong Kong, Melbourne, Miami and Shanghai are among potential venues for the first scheduled matches in 2011, while other cities will bid for the right to stage games in following seasons."]}, {"article": "Asked about the Premier League&apos;s proposal to showcase its talents around the world, an insider at one of the smaller clubs was withering. &quot;It&apos;s being pushed by the big clubs,&quot; he said. &quot;They have commitments.&quot; Commitments? &quot;To sponsors,&quot; he nodded, &quot;and to owners.&quot; When the Glazer family bought Manchester United in 2005 against all the opposition and with \u00a3540m expensively borrowed, it was difficult to see where they thought there was extra money to be made which had somehow been missed by the world&apos;s most commercial club. Until yesterday there had indeed been nothing new, only increased ticket prices for the fans at home, an improved sponsorship deal and the TV windfall which has swollen the pot for all the clubs.

The chief worry was that promotion and relegation would be abolished - if you buy a franchise in America you pay for its lucrative status, so you cannot have one bad season and find yourself at Roots Hall - but that has not seemed a threat so far. Until last week&apos;s takeover of Derby County the US-owned clubs were looking to the Champions League, rather than the Championship, and did not seem bothered about three down three up. And then, this. It feels like the first dramatic innovation influenced by the US owners and the others who bought Premier League clubs as investments, as &quot;global brands&quot;, without truly understanding the football traditions their PRs advise them to acknowledge when they do their first press conferences. It is important not to react with a Little Englander&apos;s knee-jerk. Most fans here are generally oblivious to the Premier League&apos;s popularity around the world - hostile to it, if anything, because many consider it is diluting the clubs, with all their sweat, grit and culture, into mere brands to be consumed. Yet the global audience is a true phenomenon, a huge success story, the prospering fruit of the marriage between a great, thrilling game and television. There is something inspiring about our clubs, formed in the towns and cities of Victorian England, playing to full houses of screaming fans in Bangkok, Beijing and New York, and the Premier League claims this popularity can be harnessed for the general good of our game. But it would be easier to feel inspired if this really were about spreading the joy of the sport, genuinely motivated, as the Premier League suggested yesterday, by an altruistic wish for a &quot;development opportunity&quot; in Africa. It would be easier if you could believe that the benefits really would be felt by the grass-roots game here, not that such potential would be used to lobby for the government&apos;s support. It would be easier, in short, to accept this idea if it were not so clearly driven by the same motivation which has powered the Premier League since its formation in 1992: to make more money, in whatever ways it can. Many fans here feel that the game should be headed in the opposite direction, that there is too much money coming in, that it should be shared more equally, that the TV bonanza should have subsidised ticket prices, that it should all calm down a bit. It is an irony that when a billion people worldwide, comparatively cheaply, watch Arsenal play Manchester United, here Sky&apos;s exclusivity means even the biggest matches pull in only about two million viewers. The BBC, available to all, beat that with the live FA Cup second-round tie between Harrogate Railway and Mansfield Town a few weeks ago. A bit of live football on the BBC would be most fans&apos; preference, rather than a 39th league match in Bangkok, which looks a half-baked plan on so many levels. But the Premier League was formed to make money, and the new owners have their commitments - to the clubs as &quot;global brands&quot;, to &quot;maximising revenue streams&quot;, and to the banks, who lent them so much money to take over the clubs in the first place.", "publicationDate": "2008-02-08T01:07:08Z", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/08/newsstory.premierleague3", "title": "David Conn: Owners are treating English clubs as mere brands", "sentences": ["There is something inspiring about our clubs, formed in the towns and cities of Victorian England, playing to full houses of screaming fans in Bangkok, Beijing and New York, and the Premier League claims this popularity can be harnessed for the general good of our game.", "A bit of live football on the BBC would be most fans&apos; preference, rather than a 39th league match in Bangkok, which looks a half-baked plan on so many levels."]}, {"article": "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited&apos;s digest of the day&apos;s papers LET SHARIA RULE, SAYS ARCHBISHOP &quot;What a burkha&quot; exclaims the Sun. And that, in various shades of salty language, is the attitude of all the press today to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, and his suggestion that the adoption of some aspects of Islamic sharia law in the UK is &quot;unavoidable&quot;. In a speech at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Williams argued for a &quot;plural jurisdiction&quot; that would allow Muslims to choose whether some legal disputes were resolved in secular or sharia courts. He said it would mean Muslims no longer having to choose between two systems. The suggestion gets a cool reception across the political spectrum. He&apos;s not just a &quot;batty old goat&quot;, decries the Sun, he&apos;s a &quot;dangerous threat to the nation&quot;. Next to a picture of the London bus destroyed in the 7/7 bombings, the paper calls his comments &quot;a victory for terrorism&quot;. The Express is equally scornful, describing the leader of the Church of England &quot;a mediocrity and, as a self-confessed &apos;bearded Leftie&apos;, a cringe-worthy social cliche&quot;. The Mail suggests he stick to tending to his own flock. The idea is not as outlandish as it might first appear, offers the Telegraph, in common with the other broadsheets. It points to sharia councils that already exist in the UK offering advice and religious sanction in matters such as divorce. Orthodox Jews have recourse to the beth din on dietary laws and divorce. The problem, sighs the Telegraph, lies in the &quot;political ineptitude&quot; of the archbishop in terms of his choice of messenger - himself - and the timing of his intervention. The speech came shortly after threats were made against one of Williams&apos;s fellow bishops, Dr Michael Nazir-Ali of Rochester, for his comments that Islamic extremism had tuned some communities into no-go areas. &quot;On this most inflammatory of subjects the archbishop would have best kept silent,&quot; concludes the paper. The Guardian looks at the bigger picture and sees Williams&apos;s comments as the point where &quot;secular and religious minds collide&quot;. What he really wants, says the paper, is a tolerance for the role of religion in public affairs but succeeds only in highlighting why it would be better entirely excluded. However mildly and carefully expressed his arguments, Rowan Williams &quot;has a knack for creating problems where none yet exist&quot;. The Independent wonders if the archbishop really meant to say what the papers are reporting. His comments did come in an immensely dense 7,000-word text, the Indy points out. But it adds: &quot;News has little room for the subtleties of academic gavottes around delicate subjects. A canny religious leader - or at any rate his press office - ought to know that.&quot; * Sharia and the state * Sun: What a burkha * Telegraph leader: The archbishop&apos;s intervention * Independent: Williams is snared in a trap of his own making &apos;HATE PREACHER&apos; HAMZA FACES EXTRADITION TO US Perhaps surprisingly, the Mail relegates the archbishop (or the &quot;batty old booby&quot; as it describes him) to the inside pages in favour of splashing with the news that the Islamic cleric Abu Hamza is being extradited to the US. &quot;At last, Hamza kicked out of Britain&quot; the paper rejoices. The &quot;preacher of hate&quot;, who is serving a seven-year sentence at Woolwich, south-east London, for inciting murder and race hate is wanted in the US on 11 terror charges. The Egyptian-born cleric faces spending the rest of his life in an American prison if he loses his appeal against the extradition order signed yesterday by the home secretary, Jacqui Smith. * Mail: At last, Hamza kicked out of Britain ENGLISH PRIMARY STUDENTS SORELY TESTED English primary schools are the &quot;most high-pressured in the world&quot;, reports the Independent. A study has found that pupils face tests more frequently, at a younger age and in more subjects than children from any other country. England is unique in using testing to control what is taught and monitor teaching standards, and in encouraging parents to choose schools based on the results. The outcome is a &quot;high-stakes&quot; system with the fortunes of schools bound up with how pupils do in tests. Teachers, pupils and examiners are all against it, says the Independent. &quot;The only players still clinging to the wreckage of the present testing arrangements are ministers. It is time for them to let go.&quot; The Guardian looks at the alternatives. More and more parents are turning to home education and Steiner schools to free their children from testing and targets, it reports. Research shows home-educated children perform better and children from disadvantaged backgrounds can improve disproportionately. Home-educated pupils are less likely to watch TV or spend hours on computers. * State schools shunned * Independent: Our children tested to destruction * Independent leader: an oppressive system McCAIN HAS ALL THE CHIPS Mitt Romney has pulled out of the Republican presidential primaries. He sustained a string of losses on Super Tuesday to John McCain and across the south to Mike Huckabee despite a campaign into which he had poured more than $35m (GBP17.5m) of his personal fortune. His departure means McCain has effectively secured the Republican nomination for president, as he now faces only Mike Huckabee, who has limited appeal beyond the south. It is likely Huckabee will eventually join McCain as his running mate. Romney couched his resignation as necessary to stop Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama becoming president, reports the IHT. &quot;Frankly I&apos;d be making it easier for Senator Clinton or Obama to win,&quot; he said. &quot;I simply cannot let my campaign be a part of aiding a surrender to terror.&quot; Romney struggled in the race partly because of his lack of charisma, the loss of part of his natural support on the right to Huckabee, and suspicion among Christian evangelicals about his Mormon religion, explains the Guardian. He fought a mainly negative campaign. * Way clear for McCain * IHT: Romney is out DON&apos;T TAX THE FOREIGN RICH, SAYS DIGBY JONES The FT has what it describes as a &quot;candid&quot; interview with Digby Jones, the trade and investment minister, in which he contradicts the government line on plans for a crackdown on foreigners living in the UK who are &quot;non-domiciled&quot; for tax purposes. Jones, the former CBI director general, said the clampdown would make it harder for him to sell Britain as a destination for skilled foreign workers and inward investment. Under the Treasury&apos;s proposals, the government would raise an extra \u00a3650m a year by charging foreigners living in Britain for more than seven years \u00a330,000 annually if they keep their foreign income out of the UK tax net. Wealthy individuals would be hit by the closure of loopholes allowing them to evade tax on UK assets held in offshore trusts. Jones said: &quot;It has caused people to say &apos;Does this mean you don&apos;t want us?&apos;&quot; He said there was a danger the UK would lose its &quot;badge as the place to come and bring your skill and work hard in the developed world&quot;. In its editorial, the FT says Jones has given the government a &quot;nasty bite in the rear&quot;. The principles behind the Treasury plan are sound, says the paper, but its handling has been &quot;botched&quot;. * FT: Minister warns on non-doms purge PREMIER LEAGUE OF NATIONS Rowan Williams may be able to take a small crumb of (albeit un-Christian) comfort from the fact that he is not the only person to face the vitriole of the tabloid press today. Step up Richard Scudamore, the chief executive of the football premier league. &quot;For sale: our national game&quot; splashes the Mirror. The Mail takes up the theme with the headline &quot;The man who sold our game&quot; next to a photo of Scudamore. His crime (or, rather, his &quot;grubby plan for a global gravy train&quot;, says the Mail) is the proposal that the 20 premier league football clubs play competitive fixtures around the world to raise GBP100m a year. The league wants to fit a 39th fixture - to be called the international round - into the calendar. The games would be played in mid-January in warm venues such as Sydney, Los Angeles and Cape Town. The extra fixture would be worked out by a draw, with the top five premier teams seeded so they could not play each other. Tempted by the prospect of up to GBP5m per game, the 20 clubs voted unanimously yesterday to examine how it might work. &quot;It&apos;s pure greed&quot;, denounces the Mirror. According to its chief sports writer, &quot;it&apos;s a betrayal of the essence of one of the lynchpins of British sport and it stinks&quot;. The fans have been pushed too far this time, warns the paper. The Times&apos; chief football correspondent agrees: &quot;What type of league is decided by an odd number of matches anyway? What type of league is hawked to the highest bidder, or left at the mercy of a random draw? &quot;What type of league risks alienating people that will be there for it week in, week out, whose investment is total, to flutter its eyelashes at a part-time fan whose loyalty will never be tested over a wet weekend away to West Bromwich Albion? Still, at least the local supporter now knows what matters to the Premier League. Not him, apparently. Not so much.&quot; The Guardian&apos;s David Conn warns against reacting with a Little Englander&apos;s knee-jerk. The global audience is a true phenomenon, he writes, and there is something inspiring about our clubs, formed in Victiorian England, playing to screaming fans in Bangkok, Beijing and New York. Nonetheless, he says, it would be easier to feel inspired if the move were genuinely about spreading the joy of the sport and &quot;if it were not so clearly driven by the same motivation which has powered the Premier League since its formation in 1992: to make more money, in whatever ways it can&quot;. Perhaps the oddest comment on the matter comes in the Sun from Portsmouth&apos;s Harry Redknapp: &quot;It&apos;s not natural.&quot; Since when was anything about the behaviour and wealth of footballers - and their wags - &quot;natural&quot;? * English clubs as mere brands * Times: Dedicated fan is second class FOLDING DIMENSIONS IN SPACE The traditional art of origami has reached the final frontier, reports the Times. Japan is to release a squadron of paper planes into orbit. The origami planes, which will measure about 20cm (8in) each, are to be hurled into the void by a Japanese astronaut scheduled to visit the International Space Station this summer. Should one of the heat-proofed fleet miraculously make it to Earth, its journey will have been about 300 miles, no doubt the longest flight for a paper plane. It&apos;s all to do with Japan wanting to generate some interest in a conventional space programme, but should Wrap-readers be more interested in generating their own folded fleet, the Times helpfully provides a step-by-step &quot;build your own shuttle&quot; guide. *Times: Japan&apos;s new spacecraft look so good on paper TODAY ON GUARDIAN UNLIMITED &gt;&gt;&gt; Benazir Bhutto died from head injury caused by assassination blast, Scotland Yard tells Pakistan &gt;&gt;&gt; Gunman kills five at US council meeting &gt;&gt;&gt; Sugar refinery explodes in America, leaving up to 100 hurt", "publicationDate": "2008-02-08T09:47:41Z", "tags": ["Rowan Williams"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2008/feb/08/wrap.michellepauli", "title": "Let shariah rule, says archbishop", "sentences": ["The global audience is a true phenomenon, he writes, and there is something inspiring about our clubs, formed in Victiorian England, playing to screaming fans in Bangkok, Beijing and New York."]}, {"article": "PREMIER PASSIONS Whenever the Fiver is having difficulty deciding what opinion to have on thorny issues - blonde v brunette, Tin v Special Drink, Hollyoaks v Ben Fogle&apos;s Extreme Dreams - we find out what somebody we habitually disagree with thinks, then take the opposite view. &quot;I think it&apos;s going to the well too many times with our players,&quot; said PFA chief Gordon Taylor of the Premier League&apos;s proposal to add an extra fixture to the list and send teams flying around the world to play them, prompting the Fiver to decide once and for all that the Premier League&apos;s latest money-generating wheeze is emphatically A Very Good Thing. We began to suspect ours was the correct stance when it emerged that the Football Supporters&apos; Federation was planning to stop the Premier League in their tracks by ... staging some half-hearted demonstrations. &quot;The FSF is planning local action at every Premier League club, inviting supporters of all teams to unite under the banner &apos;NO TO GAM\u00a3 39&apos;. They&apos;ve gone too far this time - and the time to do the right thing is right now,&quot; thundered a threatening statement that&apos;s bound to have the fan-friendly fat cats at Premier League HQ trembling in their expensive hand-stitched Italian loafers. Further confirmation that we were on solid ground arrived when Sunderland manager Roy Keane, who totally unpartisan Roy Keane biographer Eamon Dunphy once described as &quot;the perfect human being&quot; who &quot;is always right about everything&quot; agreed with us. &quot;Sometimes change is good,&quot; he said. &quot;I know our fans and I know they would probably find a way of travelling in numbers, even if it is on the moon - particularly if it is against Newcastle.&quot; It was a ringing endorsement of the Premier League&apos;s plan that was only slightly undermined when he went on to say &quot;the group of players [here at Sunderland], I wouldn&apos;t swap them for anybody&quot;. What, not even Michael Chopra for Ronaldinho? Meanwhile, at Old Trafford, Sir Alex Ferguson was providing further evidence that sending teams abroad in January is a super idea by cantankerously bristling about the fact that he hadn&apos;t been consulted about any of this. &quot;This should be discussed internally by clubs before they come to this position we are in today,&quot; growled the man fabled for his extreme reluctance to drag Manchester United halfway around the world in the middle of the domestic season for no good reason. The Fiver&apos;s final thought: the success of the NFL&apos;s whistle-stop visit to London last year - a stadium full of gullible, foam finger-waving gridiron devotees watching a dreadful spectacle in the rain - shows that there are eejits out there who will pay to watch anything if you market it hard enough. Let&apos;s give Bangkok, Beijing, Hong Kong, Melbourne, Miami, Shanghai, the Moon and Mars some Bolton v Wigan Premier League classics to chew on. Actually, let&apos;s give them as many as they want.

ON YOUR BIKEY! It&apos;s not the first thing you think of when you decide to embark on medical training. It&apos;s more about the graduation ceremonies, the professional esteem, the overt $exual advances from single women in their early thirties. In fact the Fiver can only assume it never entered the head of the Ghanaian physio tending to Rigobert Song during last night&apos;s African Cup of Nations semi-final that his career choices might lead directly to a furious Mick &quot;Not the Ears&quot; McManus style body-check from an enraged and heavily perspiring Andre Bikey on a steamy night in Accra. Bikey was reportedly incensed at the amount of time it was taking to load his team-mate on to a stretcher. Which has certainly given the Fiver a few ideas for the next time it has to spend half an hour reading Best! in Dr Zszgrzbbzg&apos;s waiting room when all it wants is a repeat prescription for its unsightly rash unction. The Reading bruiser is banned from the final against Egypt after his red card and has also single-handedly resurrected all those lazy stereotypes about lack of discipline, naivety, not knowing the rules - and just as the Premier League was doing so well. The presence of Bikey&apos;s Invincible Woodlouses [note: may not be correct zany nickname] in Sunday&apos;s final is still something of a shock, mainly because on the Fiver&apos;s grainy wind-up black and white they&apos;ve looked very much like 10 cloggers plus Samuel Eto&apos;o. &quot;Cameroon has the best bench in the tournament,&quot; was the explanation of their coach Otto Pfister, who sounds like Germany&apos;s answer to Ben Dover. The Fiver was going to add something about a lovely beech-effect finish here, but unfortunately it collapsed on to its own nicotine-stained keyboard at the shame of it. Pfister&apos;s Indestructible Mosquitoes will now face the Furious Pine Cones of Egypt, also surprise finalists thanks to last night&apos;s 4-1 duffing up of hosts Ghana.

The Yak has been dropped for tomorrow&apos;s game against Reading after &quot;talks&quot; with Dave &quot;The Eyes&quot; Moyes. An \u00a380,000 fine could also be in the offing.

Last year state forces crashed a private performance and arrested 60 people, including three children. In this first major staging of its work in the UK, BFT presents Being Harold Pinter, combining transcripts from Belarussian political prisoners and excerpts from Pinter plays, and Generation Jeans, a satire on freedom in Belarus.

The antihero - academic and journalist Alan - has to deal with phoney friends on Facebook, and when he says exactly what he thinks about the work of the poet Orville, he finds himself facing allegations of racism and investigations by the Press Complaints Commission.

Here they&apos;re on fairly safe ground too, as adaptations of Chekhov are pretty thick on the ground at the moment, with 3 Sisters On Hope Street playing at the Everyman in Liverpool and Headlong and the Gate doing a co-production of ...Sisters by Chris Goode later in the spring. Inspired by The Seagull, this is a little different, because it is written by Tennessee Williams and has not been seen in the UK before. In foregrounding the story of Madame Arkadina&apos;s lover - the writer Trigorin, whose actions destroy the young would be actress, Nina - this may well throw light on Chekhov&apos;s play while remaining a drama in its own right.

Today&apos;s game between Chelsea and Liverpool was billed by Sky Sports with the trail &quot;the best of the Premier League&quot;. Now, we all know how over-excited that particular marketing department gets, but then again there are pundits and players a-plenty queuing up to repeatedly inform everyone that England boasts the &quot;best league in the world&quot;. If that&apos;s the case, then God help us all. In this match - one which summed up all that is wrong with modern football - there were more holding midfielders on the pitch than strikers. Javier Mascherano, Lucas and Claude Makelele negated each other in the centre of the park, Nicolas Anelka and Peter Crouch stood and watched. Both teams had clearly set themselves up first and foremost not to get beaten; if either nicked a goal, then all good and well. Avram Grant and Rafael Benitez&apos;s tactical plans obviously worked: there was one shot on target in the entire match. Well done, Avram! Well done, Rafa! But there is a reason televised chess never took off. When sport becomes this tedious, something has gone horribly wrong somewhere down the line. Liverpool, for example, may care to consider the attitudes of holding players of yore: Graeme Souness scored roughly one goal in six. Steve McMahon roughly one in seven. Mascherano has never scored a club goal in his career; two goals for Argentina, and that&apos;s it. Though whether this is Mascherano&apos;s fault is moot: you can bet your bottom dollar Souness and McMahon didn&apos;t have to suppress any attacking instinct to the whims of a tactical &quot;genius&quot; moving their pawns around from the bench. This defence-at-all-costs attitude is ruining everything. Shall we compare and contrast the &quot;best of the Premier League&quot; with the African Cup of Nations, where midfielders pushed on, teams fielded at least two up front, and the wingbacks pressed forward? Actually let&apos;s not. It&apos;s far too depressing. Players were beating men and taking shots, for goodness sake. There have always been terrible games. But it didn&apos;t matter when fans could get in for a fiver, stand up, sing and enjoy the banter. As scales fall from eyes across the country, surely the popularity of splinter clubs such as AFC Wimbledon and FC United will become ever greater. Let&apos;s not be totally negative, though; some good can come of this. A couple more seasons of matches cut from this cloth, and fans in Bangkok, Bangalore or Beijing will rather chew tin foil than want any of our teams coming over and stinking the place out. So perhaps the integrity of our league will be saved after all. Shame the action isn&apos;t likely to get better any time soon.if", "publicationDate": "2008-02-10T18:01:45Z", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Chelsea", "Liverpool"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/10/chelsea.liverpool", "title": "Scott Murray: if that's the 'best of the Premier League' then god help us all", "sentences": ["A couple more seasons of matches cut from this cloth, and fans in Bangkok, Bangalore or Beijing will rather chew tin foil than want any of our teams coming over and stinking the place out."]}, {"article": "Arthur Christiansen, a formidable editor of the Daily Express in its heyday, used to talk of wanting to know what people were thinking about in the back streets of Derby. The Premier League would appear to be more interested in what they are saying on the sidewalks of Bangkok and Beijing yet there is a message from Derby it would do well to heed. Derby County are going down and have been going down almost from the moment they came up. Any interest they might have in plans to play Premier League games abroad, therefore, will be remote unless they are again a Premier League side by the time the proposals, if sanctioned, become reality in the 2010-2011 season. Yet the voices at Pride Park on Saturday spoke of something that may be forgotten in the latest rush to the commercial trough. Derby&apos;s biggest attendance of the season turned out to watch a team that had won only one of its previous 25 league fixtures, lost 18 and was about to lose another. The match was, for the most part, a mediocre mish-mash of fitful passing and indifferent finishing. Tottenham won comfortably once they had asserted their superiority and scored three times in the last 22 minutes, so there was not much for the home supporters to shout about. Yet shout they did from first to last. The passion with which Pride Park exhorted its hard-working but inadequate team to get something from the afternoon made the football seem more entertaining than it was. This sort of blind faith is not easily exported. It is hard to imagine Beijing or Bangkok experiencing boundless joy at the winning of a corner or even a favourable throw-in. Most of the time they would be wondering how Derby could be both a county and a town. But never mind. Under the new American owners Derby County will not be left behind. The club president and chief executive, one Tom Glick, promised in Saturday&apos;s programme that they were committed to &quot;building Derby County into a powerful worldwide brand&quot;. Either Glick is a cock-eyed optimist or the Yanks are about to win the Asian concession for Heinz tomato ketchup. The fans would settle for something more modest, like a winning team. That is unlikely to happen this season. Derby&apos;s only immediate ambition now is to avoid being relegated with the lowest number of points since three began to be awarded for a win in 1981, a dubious honour held by Sunderland who went down with 15 in 2005-06. Derby have nine with 12 games remaining so it will be a close-run thing. When Paul Jewell took over as manager from Billy Davies two months ago he was under no illusions about keeping Derby up. It was more about what he could achieve when next they attempted to win promotion, backed by new investment. &quot;What I want is to be able to compete in the Premier League,&quot; he said after Saturday&apos;s match. &quot;At the moment we&apos;re bottom of the league because we can&apos;t compete at the level Tottenham are at the moment.&quot; Not that Spurs looked up to much on Saturday until Jamie O&apos;Hara came on to link the play more intelligently in the second half followed by Dimitar Berbatov, rested initially with Thursday&apos;s Uefa Cup game against Slavia Prague in mind. As Derby tired Tottenham improved, Robbie Keane&apos;s tap-in putting them ahead after Roy Carroll had failed to hold a cross-shot from Steed Malbranque. Younes Kaboul, who had replaced the injured Michael Dawson, drove in the second following a corner and a sharp nod back by Pascal Chimbonda and Berbatov&apos;s penalty completed the victory after Alan Stubbs had handled.

It features two noxious German sexual adventurers ensconced in the oversized tub of a Bangkok bathhouse, pontificating about everything from the Holocaust to the S&amp;M joys of kinky crucifixion. &quot;I had a cat once lick my cock,&quot; says Woods, as we pull away from Basingstoke. &quot;A cat?&quot; says Haynes, without a lot of surprise. &quot;It&apos;s nice, abrasive, good for hot teenage cock.&quot; At first, the Hampshire commuters look a little disturbed by this degenerate pair of Teutonic miscreants. But as the story moves up a gear, introducing glamorous ladyboys and male prostitutes, iPods are discreetly put aside. &quot;I wondered why they were looking at me like that,&quot; says Woods, when we alight. &quot;I just thought they didn&apos;t encounter many Germans along this line.&quot; Woods and Haynes (who has changed his surname from Hough) have carved out a cult following as Ridiculusmus, a theatre company known for anarchic, surreal comedy experimentalism. Rather like an adrenaline-fuelled, 21st-century version of the Goons, with a dash of Carry On physical performance, they&apos;ve been called &quot;one of our most refreshingly provocative theatre companies&quot; and &quot;affable, blarneying loons&quot;. My first encounter with the company came at their beginnings, with their 1993 adaptation of Flann O&apos;Brien&apos;s The Third Policeman, during which audience members were hauled on stage to dance the Kerry Polka or be plied with Wrastler, O&apos;Brien&apos;s fictional stout. In my review, I made the miscalculation of suggesting that Woods ditch his boisterous cohorts, then a large collective, and go it alone: &quot;He transforms every bit-part into a central character,&quot; I wrote, &quot;while showing up the paucity of talent in the rest of the group.&quot; For years afterwards, whenever we met, Woods would be nervously genial, while the others formed a pantomime mob behind him, glowering and hissing. Since then, the company has been whittled down to just Woods and Haynes (nothing to do with my review, I&apos;m assured) and they have continued to confound with shows such as The Exhibitionists, a violent, slapstick romp set among art gallery security guards, and, most recently, an uproarious two-hand deconstruction of Oscar Wilde&apos;s The Importance of Being Earnest, in which Cecily is transformed into a self-harming teen minx. Their status as an underground phenomenon is now being honoured by the Barbican in London, which is showcasing a selection of their work. The pair have come to Eastleigh for a single try-out performance of Tough Time, Nice Time. Rehearsals consist mostly of them sitting naked in a luminous bath, barking deadpan directions at the crew: &quot;Could that lighting cue come directly after, &apos;Eat it right out of my arse&apos;?&quot; says Haynes at one point. As a double act, the Ridiculusmus dynamic is not unfamiliar: bullet-headed Woods looks louche and menacing, while Haynes is the introverted, slightly camp foil. &quot;I think we complement each other,&quot; says Woods. &quot;Some like his exuberance,&quot; chips in Haynes. &quot;Others prefer my intensity. And a lot don&apos;t like either of us.&quot; From the beginning of their career, they&apos;ve avoided directors. &quot;An unnecessary addition to the payroll,&quot; says Woods. Instead, performances grow out of improvisation. &quot;We once improvised for three days straight,&quot; says Woods.&quot;We drove to a conference in Edinburgh and back in character all the way. It&apos;s called &apos;deep impro&apos;.&quot; During a break, we retire to a greasy spoon to talk about the company&apos;s origins - but first there is something to get out of the way: &quot;That review!&quot; bellows Woods. &quot;How could you do that to an ensemble company?&quot; I make some faltering excuses. &quot;I don&apos;t even remember it,&quot; says Haynes, though in a wounded tone. After more stuttering we get on to Ridiculusmus&apos;s birth, at London&apos;s Poor School theatre academy, when a bunch of students, inspired by the Goons and Dad&apos;s Army, founded a comedy venue called the Tomato Club. &quot;We only invited comics who considered themselves bad enough,&quot; says Woods. &quot;We&apos;d hand out overripe tomatoes so the audience could pelt them.&quot; The company&apos;s name came later, a quotation from Horace meaning &quot;ridiculous mouse&quot;. Then someone suggested they do The Third Policeman. &quot;We thought he [Flann O&apos;Brien] was Edna O&apos;Brien&apos;s brother,&quot; says Woods. &quot;But that allowed us to have just the right irreverent attitude to the material.&quot; Its cult success and the anarchic follow-up, At Swim-Two-Birds, led to an invitation to relocate to Derry, but things turned sour. &quot;There was a death threat,&quot; says Woods, &quot;which was actually the Loyalist Volunteer Force threatening, in general, to kill people who were funded to do cross-community work. I was scared shitless.&quot; They retaliated with Say Nothing, performed on a tatty patch of turf symbolising Northern Ireland. It climaxed with the chant: &quot;Traditional Irish music, traditional Irish craic, traditional Irish blow your kneecaps off.&quot; They returned to Great Britain with a slew of manic shows: Yes, Yes, Yes, a riotous slapstick about mental illness; and Ideas Men, parodying brainstorming office workers. For Tough Time, Nice Time, they aim to bewilder their following again: &quot;With this one, we actually tried not to be funny,&quot; says Haynes. The scenario is simple: a bisexual German ghostwriter encounters another German hoping to sell his life story, which is mixed with murder, genocide and sexual misdemeanours. &quot;I was interested in writers who are hooked on adrenaline, people like Bruce Chatwin,&quot; says Woods, &quot;as well as the fake holocaust memoir of Binjamin Wilkomirski. We are all taking traumatic life writing to the level where it is porn. People consume it like porn.&quot; As the audience filters in for the show, I hear one primly dressed woman say: &quot;It&apos;s a risky little number for Eastleigh.&quot; But despite the incendiary dialogue, and references to rent boys and coprophilia, mass indignation fails to materialise. In the post-show discussion, the only complaint comes from a man who missed the beginning and couldn&apos;t discern a middle or an end. On the train back to London, the pair are already thinking about their next work: &quot;We want to have a break from intense dialogue,&quot; says Woods, &quot;so we&apos;re going to create the piece only from inane phrases we detest. We want it to be an absolutely brainless medley of characters with nothing to say.&quot; Most of all, they intend to continue making challenging, small-scale work that embodies the fringe spirit: &quot;We used to have this dream of being commissioned to do a BBC TV series,&quot; says Woods. &quot;But we&apos;ve realised that&apos;s all nonsense. So we&apos;ve regressed back to just making very good, low-key fringe theatre, really celebrating the imagination. Fifteen years ago, that&apos;s what we set out to do.&quot; Haynes adds: &quot;Critical success would upset our equilibrium.

Experience has shown that one of the best ways to boost access to medicines is to give preference to affordable generic versions of patented drugs. Generic competition has helped drive down the price of a yearly supply of the average Aids treatment from $15,000 in 2001 to less than $100. Yet, despite his lofty pronouncement, Mandelson has been pursuing policies that could seriously undermine access to medicines. This was most evident when he complained (pdf) to the Thai government last summer about Bangkok&apos;s decision to circumvent patents held by large pharmaceutical companies on treatments for Aids and heart disease. Even though one-third of the Thai population lives on less than $2 a day and the country has 580,000 people (pdf) living with HIV, a letter signed by Mandelson expressed more concern about damage to intellectual property rights than efforts to keep people alive. After this letter was leaked, Mandelson had to resort to some extraordinary face-saving - even by the standards of his often grubby past record. To placate MEPs, he claimed there had been &quot;misunderstandings&quot; about his stance and that he would not be seeking any provisions that would hamper access to medicines in free trade agreements signed between the EU and &quot;poor developing countries&quot;. By only granting an assurance to the least fortunate parts of the world, Mandelson has left his officials enough scope to continue their old tricks with pretty much everyone else. Recently, there have been attempts to push South Korea into making its national drug regulators legally obliged to respect the so-called data exclusivity enjoyed by pharmaceutical firms for a decade. Data exclusivity covers the length of time which information used to make a medicine under patent cannot be used by manufacturers of generic drugs. The Koreans have steadfastly refused to accept such a clause in the free trade accord they are negotiating with the EU. Luckily for them, Mandelson&apos;s officials finally accepted that it would have to drop its demand last month - although they are still seeking other provisions on intellectual property that are likely to have far-reaching consequences. Just because the World Bank regards Korea as a high-income country does not mean that the Seoul government shouldn&apos;t have the freedom to put public health interests ahead of the profits of large drug firms. Korea also has one of the widest gaps between rich and poor in the industrialised world. Europe&apos;s trade officials are not easily chastened. There is no guarantee that they will not endeavour to have the provisions rejected by Korea inserted into the trade liberalisation pacts they are negotiating with a range of other - frequently poorer - countries. Rather, there are indications that they feel almost duty-bound to behave as proxy lobbyists for multinational drug firms. In a 2006 strategy paper called Global Europe, the European commission commited itself to demanding the stringent enforcement of intellectual property throughout the world. Furthermore, it is disturbing that the European commission has been trying to employ the same tactics as the Bush administration. Washington has bullied central American countries into accepting data exclusivity provisions in an accord they signed with the US in 2004 and are in the process of implementing. Costa Rica&apos;s domestic pharmaceutical industry has warned (pdf) that prices of medicine could increase by 800% as a result. Mandelson&apos;s officials are now intimately involved in a project undertaken by the World Health Organisation, which was initiated after a WHO study (pdf) concluded that unless there is greater clarity about some of the surrounding issues, intellectual property rights will still be invoked by drug firms in a way that continues to deprive the poor of potentially life-saving medicines. The WHO has indicated that it wishes to present a plan of action this year. If Mandelson is to make any positive contribution, he should specify where his true loyalties lie.

After all, who in their right mind would hop on a plane and if they knew it would send theguardian.com&apos;s more malevolent and sanctimonious readers into a simmering self-righteous fury over ... not much really when you think about it? Yep, us too. The reports in question featured in today&apos;s Lahn&apos;s Lahn E&apos;n&apos;n Stannah and were denied in the time it takes an angry commuter to barge past one of those poor sods in purple and yellow windcheaters whose job it is to create bottlenecks at entrances to Tube stations while handing out free litter (aka London Lite and the lowercasepaper). &quot;I don&apos;t know where the report has come from,&quot; harrumphed a Premier League suit. &quot;It&apos;s simply not true. That&apos;s not something we&apos;re considering at this time.&quot; Should the Premier League change its mind at another time and decide to have its day in court with Fifa, the Fiver understands that it will consider staging the case in one of several court houses dotted around the globe: Miami, Melbourne, Beijing, Bangkok or Hong Kong, mainly because Premier League chief Richard Scudamore is sick of British journalists mistaking him for his namesake, BBC racing pundit and former champion jockey Peter Scudamore. Australia is rumoured to be Scu&apos;s venue of choice, because it&apos;s believed he likes the idea of appearing under headlines such as &apos;KANGAROO COURT&apos; and admires the humanity shown by Toadfish Rebecchi when he agreed to represent Susan Kennedy on Neighbours yesterday. Sepp Blatter has already compared the Premier League&apos;s proposal for a 39th game to his own presidency of Fifa, describing it as &quot;unacceptable&quot; and &quot;an abuse of football&quot;. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;Before I went to Middlesbrough, Sir Alex Ferguson told me &apos;Pick the chairman, not the club&apos;. And I was lucky I picked Steve Gibson, who believed in my philosophy and gave me time.

Roy from Siegfried and Roy being savaged by his own white tiger. The Fiver is no stranger to the realisation now and then that maybe, just maybe, the magic has died. And few would deny it&apos;s been a while since the FA Cup was at its most hat-doffing, huzzah-shouting, old-fellows-with-terrible-teeth-waggling-rattles zenith. Even with a Man Utd v Arsenal live-on-the-BBC fifth-rounder in the offing the Fiver suspects it might be rather difficult to rouse itself from beneath its duvet of Pot Noodle pots and WKD Blue bottles come tomorrow tea time. Just listen to the pre-match jousts. &quot;There are massive games to come so we have to balance our teams,&quot; Sir Alex mumbled today, some notches short of the full phlegm-spattering finger-in the-face treatment. Similarly Arsene - speaking to London&apos;s Lahn E&apos;n&apos;n Stannah - also managed to force out a few noises that might be interpreted as, not so much pre-match mind games, more a pre-match listless-and-ultimately-abandoned round of charades. &quot;My relationship with Alex is OK, but the rivalry is intense,&quot; he yawned, waking up sufficiently to add: &quot;He&apos;s older than me, but why shouldn&apos;t he work on?&quot; while applying Boots No7 Age Rewind cream and doing his facercise routine. Perhaps it&apos;s the thought of Gaz Lineker and the boys - the A-listers, mind, none of your Gavin &quot;Groovy Youth Club Worker&quot; Peacock - on their sofas pretending they do this kind of thing every week. Maybe it&apos;s the prospect of Stubbsy doing one of his &quot;interviews&quot;. Even news that Wayne Rooney has been released from his cage can rouse no more than a minor sneeze of excitement. Kolo Toure and Emanuel Eboue are back? Barely a flicker. But wait. What&apos;s this? &quot;To motivate people you need the hunter&apos;s animal instinct.&quot; Blimey! It&apos;s Arsene, still warbling into the man from the Stannah&apos;s Dictaphone. &quot;With age the balance changes - the animal instinct shrinks.&quot; Well, well and the Fiver thought it was just the cold weather. &quot;Galileo was considered a heretic. But he was right, wasn&apos;t he? I try to make my players innovators.&quot; So there you go: William Gallas inventing the telescope and Gael Clichy being tried for heresy by the Catholic church live on the BBC. Doesn&apos;t sound so bad after all, does it? ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL While speed-reading some glitzy rag, the Fiver was very impressed and a little jealous to learn that Uma Thurman is keen on hooking up with Rafa Benitez. Then we re-read the piece slowly and saw the handsome Liverpool manager is in fact being linked with Lilian Thuram. Newcastle and the Queen&apos;s Celtic are preparing offers sweet enough to lure Richard &quot;The Honey Monster&quot; Dunne to St James&apos; Park and Queen&apos;s Celtic Park respectively. Martin O&apos;Neill is planning his own twin towers attack and will buy Peter Crouch to partner John Carew. To the tune of a Musical Youth classic, Gary Megson wants Saint-\u00c9tienne&apos;s Pascal Feindouno on the left hand side. Juventus want Gael Clichy. And what Juventus want, they sometimes get. And sometimes don&apos;t. So there you have it. Drogheda goalkeeper Dan Connor will defy medical science by hippy-hippy-shaking off a hippy-hippy-hip injury that threatened to rule him out of the start of the Eircom League season. And when Frank Rijkaard heads off on his holidays this summer, Marcello Lippi will nip into Barcelona&apos;s managerial hot seat and claim squatter&apos;s rights. * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Referee Mark Clattenburg can expect to be on the receiving end of plenty of intimidating verbal abuse and finger-pointing tomorrow; John Terry has recovered from foot-knack in time to line up against Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup. Calm indifference reigned throughout the land as Stewart Downing ended the uncertainty surrounding his Middlesbrough future by signing a new five-year contract. Having kept the saddle of Bryan Robson&apos;s managerial merry-go-round horse warm, Kevin Blackwell has been installed as Sheffield United manager until the end of the season. Sir Trevor Brooking has secured new funding for grassroots football from the FA which will benefit five-to-12-year-olds. &quot;I headed the winner of the 1980 Cup final,&quot; said Brooking. &quot;It was strange because I didn&apos;t score with many headers, you know.&quot; The number of former Longford Town tyros that call Turners Cross home has increased by one now that Alan Mathews has secured the scrawl of Dave Mooney for Cork City. Valenciennes coach and renowned disciplinarian Antoine Kombouare has so many knacked players he&apos;s struggling to name a squad for Saturday&apos;s Ligue 1 visit to bottom club Metz. &quot;Maybe it&apos;s my fault, maybe my training sessions are too tough,&quot; he told reporters, thrashing David Sommeil up a big hill with a stout birch.

There is stall upon stall of delicious desserts, tasty sausages, delectable soups and noodles; it&apos;s hard not to eat well. I like the slightly fermented pork sausage, sai grop - its name means crispy intestine, but that belies how sumptuous it is, cooked slowly over charcoal. There are two stalls in particular that do a good job of it; slightly sour with garlic, ginger, chillies and green papaya. I couldn&apos;t pinpoint exactly where they are, you&apos;ll have to explore and try yourself - not such a hard task.  The fish dumpling soup at the Suan Lum night market makes you nod your head with pleasure.  Breakfast time Thais love tea. They have their tea with everything, even with their coffee; if you ask for water, you&apos;ll get tea, just to prove it&apos;s been boiled. But have coffee with deep-fried Chinese bread at an early morning market. It tastes of chicory and chocolate powder; it&apos;s completely wrong - commercial, chemical and wonderful.  Street credibility Walk through Bangkok and it&apos;s clear that work is just something that gets in the way of eating. The most accessible food in Bangkok is street food. Food stalls outnumber pedestrians and streets can seem not so much thoroughfares as corridors lined with places to buy food. The markets can be a bit rough - rude, abrupt and daunting - but you will smack your lips in pleasure when trying the robust dishes. A restaurant meal to impress  It&apos;s almost impossible to recommend a restaurant in Thailand that&apos;s actually a restaurant. They don&apos;t have a restaurant culture, it&apos;s all about market food. In a fancy, poncy restaurant, the food will be nowhere near as good as the markets. Because the Thais have impeccable manners, they cater to what they think the diner wants, so you&apos;ll find more westernised dishes, more spaghetti bolognese, in restaurants.  Krua Apsorn (Samsen Rd, between Wat Rachathiwat and the National Library, 0066 2 241 8528) is one of the few restaurants that doesn&apos;t disappoint. It&apos;s not a slap-up meal place; if you took your Valentine there you&apos;d get a slap in the face - until they wrapped their lips around a curry or two. It has an outstanding menu. The yellow curry with lotus shoots is outstanding. People go there just for that. There are some conventional dishes that are commonplace, but in the chef&apos;s hands they are lip-smacking. I&apos;d slap my Valentine if he didn&apos;t take me there. Muslim Restaurant (1217-9 New Road, +2 233 1010) is unprepossessing and one of the oldest restaurants in the city, it serves one of the best beef panaeng curries, with cumin, spices and salt. They cater for local workers who sniff at the tourists, but only because they might take that extra, last portion.  Where to drink Maybe I&apos;ve lived in London too long, but in Bangkok the drinks are so light you have to order a triple just to get a proper measure. You&apos;re sucking on a G&amp;T going hell for leather just to find the alcohol. There is one great bar, classic Bangkok, called Phranakorn Bar  (58/2 Soi Damnoen Klang Tai, Thanon Ratcadamnoen, +2 622 0282). You have to go through a dodgy cafe on the first floor - the kind of place you&apos;d get a bacon butty in London - then the next level is a pool hall, then an art gallery, then at the top is this lounge bar overlooking temples, playing 50s and 60s music, with decent cocktails. It&apos;s not glamorous - a local student bar - but there&apos;s something charming about it. It&apos;s the unlikelihood of the place that&apos;s so alluring.  And China Town is pretty good at night. That older part of the city is dishevelled, disreputable and has great buildings and atmosphere. Asia as you imagine it to be. Club classics There are a few gay nightclubs that are mixed, with good music and a lively bar scene, such as DJ Station (Silom Soi 2, dj-station.com). The Khao San Road is changing from being a backpackers&apos; place. It used to be called &quot;Slum Farang&quot; - westerners&apos; slum - by the Thais, but now there are a few good bars and hip nightclubs.  What to buy  Taking food back home is iffy, so I&apos;d buy some copper woks from the markets to make desserts and fancy curries. The Soi 55 area is good for shopping for modern Bangkok style; furniture, designer clothes. It&apos;s worth seeing what modern Bangkok&apos;s all about. Escape the city I like getting out to Ayuthaya, the old Thai capital. At its peak in the late 17th century, it was a city bigger in size and riches - and more cosmopolitan - than London or Paris. It had a Greek prime minister and all nationalities living there. Then the Burmese razed it in 1767 and the Thais left. It has extraordinary ruined temples. I like to take the boat there, which takes twice as long, but you see how life used to be. \u00b7David Thompson runs Nahm (+44 (0)20-7333 1000, nahm.como.bz), a Michelin-starred Thai restaurant at the Halkin Hotel, London, and is author of the book Thai Food (Ten Speed Press).

King was in town to support a strike by garbage workers; his trip had already been haunted by death threats, and although they were hardly the first, the 39-year-old Baptist minister and activist eerily predicted his own end, proclaiming to his audience: &apos;And then I got to Memphis. And some began to ... talk about the threats that were out ... What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers ... But I&apos;m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God&apos;s will. And He&apos;s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I&apos;ve looked over, and I&apos;ve seen the promised land! I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land.&apos; His assassination the following evening changed America for ever and defined almost everything that ensued, including music, especially black music. For the preacher of &apos;The Dream&apos; of peace and brotherhood to be gunned down in what was already a political and cultural cauldron meant there could now be no turning away from what was happening in America and the world. The moment had come - as Sly Stone sang - to &apos;Stand!&apos; and be counted. The assassin had found the right man, as would another, killing Bobby Kennedy at the Ambassador hotel in Los Angeles two months later. It is hard to imagine what the four decades since would have been like had both men lived. On every radio set, at home and in Vietnam, Marvin Gaye&apos;s honeyed yearning for love became urgent demands: &apos;What&apos;s Going On&apos; and &apos;What&apos;s Happening, Brother&apos;, the Temptations now spinned a &apos;Ball of Confusion (That&apos;s What the World is Today)&apos;, Stevie Wonder saw something different in the mirror of his mind from &apos;My Cherie Amour&apos; - and was now &apos;asking &apos;Heaven Help us All&apos;. Sly and the Family Stone insisted: &apos;Don&apos;t call me Nigger, Whitey, Don&apos;t Call me Whitey, Nigger&apos; and Aretha Franklin demanded &apos;Respect&apos;, casting off the &apos;Chain of Fools&apos;. And James Brown went from &apos;Papa&apos;s Got a Brand New Bag&apos; to &apos;Say It Loud I&apos;m Black and I&apos;m Proud&apos;. Along with Muhammad Ali, the soul singer was America&apos;s most prominent black figure in 1968 and the song became a slogan for his generation and those to follow, a slogan which would also set cities across America, Britain and later France ablaze. But igniting the ghetto was exactly what Brown didn&apos;t want, and exactly what he stopped from happening. Because before he recorded that song, this deeply ambivalent emblem of the period would enter the annals of the history not only of music, but also the narrative of King&apos;s death itself - on the night after the murder, that of 5 April 1968, James Brown made music keep the peace with one of the most remarkable concerts ever. As news spread that the bullet had found its quarry in Memphis and that King was dead, a wave of rioting engulfed 150 cities and towns across America. One of those cities, potentially, was Boston, where Kevin White, the Irish-American mayor, elected only three months beforehand, was in a cinema watching Gone With the Wind when an aide passed him a note reading: &apos;Martin Luther King has been assassinated in Memphis&apos;. White went back to Scarlett, Rhett and Mammy until another aide tapped his elbow, saying that Edmund McNamara, the Police Commissioner, wanted a word. In the cinema manager&apos;s office, White learned by telephone that fires were sprinkling the night sky over Boston&apos;s Roxbury and South End ghettoes. He headed on foot for police headquarters, and thence to join his assistant, Barney Frank - now a senior Democrat congressman - in the mayoral office. White was of a mind to deploy a heavy police presence but Frank recalls cautioning him that this might only escalate the violence, and wherever possible, prudence should allow black community leaders themselves to try to contain it. According to an account of events in J. Anthony Lukas&apos;s epic history of postwar Boston, Common Ground, &apos;nothing in Kevin White&apos;s experience had remotely prepared him for the racial explosion he faced in April&apos;. Nevertheless, White counted among his supporters Boston&apos;s first and only black councilman, Tom Atkins, who now disturbed the mayor&apos;s troubled sleep on the office couch with a call at 9am to announce that &apos;something terrible is about to happen&apos;. James Brown was coming to town. Not that Atkins wasn&apos;t a fan of the Godfather of Soul. He hailed from Indianapolis, but had to leave his home state for Michigan to wed his white college sweetheart because interracial marriage was illegal in Indiana. He studied Arabic at Harvard and stayed in Boston to work for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, for which he became Boston&apos;s executive secretary. The Boston Globe of 1963 recorded his &apos;stern young voice boom metallically&apos; as it exhorted a rally of 6,000 blacks to &apos;march to the polls and vote&apos;. What troubled Atkins was that he had taken a call from a DJ called James Byrd on Boston&apos;s soul station, WILD, who doubled as the local agent for James Brown. Byrd said that Brown had been booked to play the Boston Garden to an audience of 14,000 that night, the vast majority of whom would be young and black. For all its claims to American aristocracy, the city remained highly segrated and the violence over desegregation of schools had been worse than anywhere else in the north. The Garden, nervous that the concert was tantamount to hosting a riot, had cancelled the show. Atkins needed no time to realise that, with America in tinderbox mode, for the gig not to go ahead would light the fuse to an even bigger powder keg. &apos;There&apos;ll be thousands of black teenagers down at the Garden,&apos; he later recalled pleading to White, &apos;and when they find those gates locked, they&apos;re going to be pretty pissed. King&apos;s death and Brown&apos;s cop-out will get all mixed up and we&apos;ll have an even bigger riot that last night, only this time it will be in the heart of downtown.&apos; Frank admits that he had thought Brown was a famous football player. White had never heard of him, and kept referring to him as &apos;James Washington&apos;. Atkins persuaded the mayor not only that the concert should go ahead, but that the proceedings should be televised to keep people off the streets. The task was to convince the Garden, the TV stations - and James Brown himself. Three commercial channels balked, but public broadcaster WGBH agreed. Byrd was livid, explaining that Brown had recorded a television show in New York, conditional on exclusivity, and would &apos;not like&apos; this breach of contract. With Brown in the TV studio, Byrd called his manager, Greg Moses, who raised another problem: Brown would &apos;take a bath&apos; if no one turned up for the show, in which case who would underwrite the gate? The answer dawned on Atkins: the city of Boston. White was appalled, but Atkins won him round, the mayor warning that it must never &apos;get out that we underwrote a goddam rock star with city money&apos;. Atkins told Moses that the city would make up the difference between whatever Brown netted and the value of a full house. So Atkins and White boarded the mayoral limo for Logan airport to greet the Godfather of Soul. America had reached a point of explosive convergence between the politics of race and racism, the Civil Rights movement led by King, the culture of insurrection in mid-Sixties America and war in Vietnam. President Lyndon Johnson made civil rights a pillar of his &apos;Great Society&apos; agenda but approved massive increases in spending on the war in south-east Asia. King, meanwhile, had the insight to see how &apos;the bombs in Vietnam explode at home. They destroy the hopes of a decent America. The promises of the Great Society have been shot down on the battlefields of Vietnam.&apos; &apos;Vietnam invaded every corner of American music&apos;, music historian Craig Werner later wrote, and &apos;no matter how often LBJ, Nixon or for that matter the Weathermen or the Panthers lied about how profoundly our experiences of Vietnam were connected, the music told the truth&apos;. It had been in the South that King launched the movement against American apartheid, but Chicago was the focal point of America&apos;s insurrection in 1968: where the black movement converged with Abbie Hoffman&apos;s &apos;Yippie&apos; revolt - whereby the &apos;Summer of Love&apos; had grown up and got serious about race and Vietnam - and violence engulfed the Democrat party convention, for which both Black Panthers and Yippies would famously stand trial. The city&apos;s Southside ghetto had, to a greater extent than its counterparts, brought with it in the migration from the cottonfields the dual howl of the black odyssey, the blues and gospel. But, as the great Chicago bluesman Willie Dixon confessed: &apos;Every time you change the news, you got to change the blues because the news ain&apos;t always the same.&apos; While the blues had chronicled the tribulations of black America, they did not confront the system. To do that, a new sound emerged: soul, and soul was about to become inescapably political. Curtis Mayfield, born in Chicago in 1942, recorded his &apos;People Get Ready&apos; with the Impressions in 1965. &apos;There&apos;s a train a-coming&apos;, it cautioned, &apos;you don&apos;t need no baggage, you just get on board&apos;. The train was &apos;picking up passengers from coast to coast&apos; and although it was a nominally a train to religious salvation, this locomotive was a barely coded metaphor for an iron horse a-coming in this life too. This is what, looking back, Chuck D of hip hop group Public Enemy explains as the &apos;brewing period. When what is sung ain&apos;t necessarily what is heard. When Martha Reeves sings &quot;Dancing In the Street&quot;, people are thinking about doing other things in the streets, so that song becomes an anthem of the riots.&apos; In 1967, the Impressions released &apos;We&apos;re a Winner&apos;, but now the message was loud and proud: &apos;No more tears do we cry/ We have finally dried our eyes/ And we&apos;re movin&apos; on up&apos; Mayfield performed it at a Panthers rally in the Oakland Auditorium early in 1968, in the company of Bobby Seale and Stokely Carmichael. On the other hand, he praised King - Mayfield&apos;s &apos;musical truth&apos; involved a high-wire act between &apos;Black Power&apos; and a democratic world for all people. There were other strains, too: Nina Simone had hitched her heart-stopping voice to the mast of the civil rights movement as early as 1964 with &apos;Mississippi Goddam&apos;, in response to the murder of Medgar Evers by the Ku Klux Klan and the bombing of a black church in Alabama, killing four children, in 1963, and Aretha Franklin was engaged directly with Dr King, a family friend and regular visitor to the Franklin household. In Detroit, Tamla Motown had burst black music&apos;s banks into the mainstream. In California, whites and blacks played together for the first time in Sly and the Family Stone, of which the Panthers disapproved. And then there was the Hardest Working Man in Showbusiness. By 1968 James Brown become a superstar and businessman, a pioneer of black capitalism, telling audiences that &apos;Black Power&apos; meant owning radio stations, a restaurant franchise and a Rolls- Royce as he did, and employing a retinue of staff. He had travelled far: born, according to his autobiography, in 1933 in a shack outside Barnwell, South Carolina, he had been abandoned by his mother and then his father, and raised by an aunt at the brothel she ran in Augusta, Georgia. He hustled, picked cotton, shined shoes, cut sugar cane, excelled in sports and boxing and stole cars for which he was sentenced to hard labour - and learned music, playing piano in the prison gym and forming a gospel quartet. Brown&apos;s stardom, his cogency and hypnotic dazzle, his blackness, was beyond rhetoric. It got called &apos;soul&apos; or &apos;funk&apos; but even these words were insufficient - Brown&apos;s potency was mercurial and subliminal as well as in-your-face and primal. The sound that he was speeding towards by 1968 all but dispensed with melody and harmony, bringing an orgasmic howl and raw rhythm to the fore; even Jimmy Nolen&apos;s chicken-scratch guitar was percussive. Its power was in the pulsating, restless, heartbeat that gave voice to the energy, virility and vibrancy of the ghetto street, but without a trace of victimhood. Quite the reverse: Brown and cuts like the seminal &apos;Cold Sweat&apos; were becoming a gale-force statement of pride, black pride even before &apos;Say It Loud&apos;. As he rose to mega-stardom, it was as though the new generation of black youth of America had found and created James Brown, rather than the artist finding his public. His sound was the uprising, it was (to re-assert Craig Werner&apos;s phrase) &apos;the truth&apos; and the truth was political without Brown having to say so. Then between 23 and 27 July 1967, the worst riots in American history had swept Detroit and 47 people, mostly black, were killed. Brown joined Martha Reeves to plead that &apos;it&apos;s not time to steal, shoot and kill one another&apos;. To address the causes of rioting, Lyndon Johnson tasked his Vice-President, Hubert Humphrey, to oversee a commission on education among blacks. Humphrey approached leading figures to solicit their support for a &apos;Stay in School&apos; drive and entertained Brown at the White House. The result was Brown&apos;s &apos;Don&apos;t be a Dropout&apos;, with its chorus: &apos;Without an education, you might as well be dead&apos;. In January 1967, Humphrey decreed the distribution of &apos;Don&apos;t be a Dropout&apos;, with badges and supporting literature, to almost every radio station in America. While Brown&apos;s relationship with Humphrey was seen as vainglorious by black militants, his campaign was prescient of the movement&apos;s later shift from &apos;Burn Baby Burn&apos; to &apos;Learn Baby Learn&apos;. Never simple to characterise, the singer&apos;s politics could be described as being even whimsical. &apos;When a great man is killed for no reason and he happens to be your friend,&apos; he continued in his autobiography, &apos;you feel the loss twice over. In Martin&apos;s case, it was all one feeling, because with him it was like the nation had lost its greatest friend. That&apos;s what Martin was - America&apos;s best friend. And a lot of Americans didn&apos;t even realise it ... Like a lot of people, I knew [the assassination] was going to bring a great deal of violence, burning and death, and I know everybody would lose by it. I don&apos;t want it to happen, and I knew Martin wouldn&apos;t want it to happen.&apos; Brown called the radio stations he owned in Baltimore and Knoxville, demanding to be put live on air. &apos;I urged the people to stay calm, to honour Dr King by being peaceful.&apos; Next day, he recorded his TV show in New York and went &apos;from the studio directly to the airport and flew to Boston. I wanted to go through with my concert there because I thought it would give me an opportunity to keep some people off the streets that night - the night everybody was predicting the worst rioting - and to talk them out of the situation.&apos; He remembers being met by Mayor White and Atkins, and being &apos;filled in on the situation&apos; in the limo. Atkins, recalls Brown, had told the mayor that if the show had been cancelled &apos;he&apos;d be lucky if his own office was left standing&apos;. After a long wrangle about Brown&apos;s other TV contract in New York, &apos;we both got to talking about how we felt about Dr King. &apos;&quot;You know&quot;, I said, &quot;I didn&apos;t always agree with him, but he was a great man and he did a lot for all of us ... If I was faced with some of the same situations he was - people beating me, throwing things at me, cursing me, spitting on me - I don&apos;t know if I could stay non-violent, not as a matter of philosophy&apos;. &apos;&quot;I know what you mean&quot;, [Atkins] said, &quot;I once spent an entire night in Mississippi in 1964 arguing that point with him. I&apos;m non-violent if I have to be, but I don&apos;t want anybody to ever make the mistake of thinking they could hit me and get away with it&quot;. &apos;&quot;Brother, that&apos;s where I&apos;m at,&quot; I said. &quot;But I had the deepest respect and love for him.&quot;&apos; By now the car was arriving at the Boston Garden, surrounded by fans come to claim refunds because they could now see the concert for free at home on TV. And Brown stops thinking about King, turning to the matter of money again. &apos;Now things were really a mess. For the first time I got really mad.&apos; The TV recording of the show was &apos;killing the gate ... I&apos;m going to have to play to an empty house, I&apos;m going to have to pay for it myself.&apos; Atkins calmed him down, and told him that &apos;the city guarantees the gate&apos;. &apos;Fair enough,&apos; said Brown. &apos;Let&apos;s get to it.&apos; Brown&apos;s own later account omits a huddle in the mayor&apos;s office during which he demands a guarantee of $60,000. The mayor was appalled. &apos;Martin Luther King had just been killed&apos;, J Anthony Lukas later wrote, &apos;and the highest paid black performer in America who made $2 million a year, had a Victorian mansion, a Rolls-Royce, two Cadillacs ... was worrying about the gate from one measly concert! But White was running out of options. &quot;Okay Mr Brown,&quot; he said, &quot;you&apos;ve got your commitment, now get up on that stage!&quot; &apos; Actually, it was Atkins who took the stage, watched by 2,000 mainly black youths in a hall less than a sixth full. &apos;This country owes James Brown a great debt,&apos; he said, &apos;and we&apos;re lucky to have him here tonight with us. Give a great round of applause to James Brown!&apos; The audience did, but it was not the Godfather of Soul who took the next turn, it was a man Atkins described as &apos;young, a man who cares, and he&apos;s going to make this a great city - the honourable mayor!&apos; The crowd deflated at the sight of Kevin White in a slick blue suit. Sensing his anxiety, and the crowd&apos;s hesitation, Brown seized the mike, telling the audience: &apos;This is one swingin&apos; cat. Okay, yeah, give him a round of applause, ladies and gentlemen, he&apos;s a swingin&apos; cat!&apos; Masterfully (if absurdly) blessed, the mayor told a now willing audience that, &apos;Twenty-four hours ago, Dr King died for all of us, black and white, that we may live together in harmony. Now, I&apos;m here to ask for your help, to make Dr King&apos;s dream a reality in Boston ... and pledge that what any other community might do, we in Boston will honour Dr King in peace.&quot; &apos;The man is TOGETHER!&apos; shouted Brown, adding: &apos;Let&apos;s not do anything to dishonour Dr King.&apos; Then he lit the fuse under one of the great concerts of all time, throwing off his jacket and launching into a frantic, pleading, driving account of - of all things - &apos;Has Everybody Got the Feeling?&apos;. They sure as hell had, and there was no turning back now, not for Brown, not for Boston, not for music. The Godfather of Soul stormed through the songs they loved best in the Garden and at home on TV, while the streets of Boston remained empty and silent, as every other ghetto in America burned. The concert was a fulgent stroke of lightning, as surviving footage proves, Brown in overdrive and on fire, even by his standards. The sound was impenitent, his body and voice way up the Richter scale as he thundered through &apos;Papa&apos;s Got a Brand New Bag&apos;, &apos;Please Please Please&apos; and the rest, punctuating the music with his own prototype of rap - gasping and rasping his lyrics - entwined with impromptu homage to the dead Dr. King. &apos;Throughout the show,&apos; Brown recalls, &apos;I tried to work in a little rap about Dr King and the whole situation. I talked about my life and where I&apos;d come from. At one point, when I was just reminiscing about Martin, I started to cry - just a few tears rolling out, nothing anybody could see - but it was like it was all starting to really sink in what we lost. But I pulled myself together, I thought that would do the most good, and went on with the show.&apos; Backstage during the course of the concert, talking by radio to police cars patrolling empty streets, Atkins and the mayor negotiated with WGBH, Boston&apos;s public radio broadcaster, for the whole show to be repeated as soon as it was over. Brown came back to agree between numbers that was &apos;fine by me&apos;, and announced as much before going into his finale, at which point a group of fans breached security and clambered on to the stage to shake Brown by the hand. The police made a move to clear them off. &apos;All it would take,&apos; recalls Brown, &apos;to destroy everything I had been trying to do all night long was for there to be an incident with the police and have it televised.&apos; Brown stopped the music, and parlayed with the police: &apos;I&apos;m all right&apos;, he said, &apos;I want to shake their hands&apos;, which he did, before asking the fans to please, and quietly, leave the stage, which they did, before hurrying home to watch the televised re-run. One of those roaming the streets that night was Peter Wolf, lead singer in the J Geils Band. &apos;I remember going through the South End, and every window seemed to be watching James Brown,&apos; he says. &apos;My wife and I went to the Garden that night,&apos; remembers one fan, Robin Upton, now living in Cambridge across the Charles River. &apos;We were so upset about the King assassination ... and were probably the only white people over 30 in the place.&apos; Years later, Upton met Mayor White and he mentioned &apos;how frightened we had been when we first got there&apos;. White replied: &apos;Nowhere near as frightened as I was.&apos; But, says Leon Rock, another witness to the show, now living in Maryland: &apos;I grew up in the old Orchard Park public housing, and was one of those black teenagers Mayor Kevin White was scared would riot at that time. I knew councillor Thomas Atkins well, and if it were not for Mr Brown and his impassioned plea from the stage for blacks to be cool and not set fire to their own neighbourhoods and communities, Boston would have had a race riot on its hands. But James Brown was more than Mr Please Please Please. He was a brother who ... energised generations: &quot;Say It Loud I&apos;m Black and I&apos;m Proud&quot;.&apos; By the time James Brown recorded that song, his capriciousness had taken him elsewhere. He travelled directly from Boston to Washington DC, were several people had been killed in the rioting, and &apos;I couldn&apos;t believe the destruction: buildings smoking, smashed glass all over the streets&apos;. He went on live television, and said: &apos;I know how everybody feels. I feel the same way. But you can&apos;t accomplish anything by blowing up, burning up, stealing and looting. Don&apos;t terrorise, organise. Don&apos;t burn, give the kids a chance to learn. Go home. Be ready. Be qualified. Be somebody - that&apos;s Black Power.&apos; Within a month, though, Brown had dined at the White House and cut the patriotic &apos;America is My Home&apos;, before he endorsed Vice President Humphrey, who was contesting the Democratic nomination for the Presidency against the man who embodied the civil rights movement more than any other since King&apos;s death, Bobby Kennedy. So in early June, while the &apos;cool&apos; artists flocked to a massive Kennedy fundraiser at the Los Angeles Sports arena, Humphrey appeared on stage with Brown at a concert in the same city with the crucial California primary approaching. &apos;You can do the boogaloo, man&apos;, Brown rapped at the VP, who started, excruciatingly, to gyrate. He was trounced in the California primary. But when Kennedy went to make his victory speech at the Ambassador hotel on 6 June with the White House in sight, he was assassinated. Brown had backed a bumbling pro-war loser agsinst the great hope of the civil rights movement, and it hardly helped his standing when within days, he left on another extraordinary adventure: for Vietnam, of all places. The very fact of his Pentagon-assisted visit was seen as a further betrayal. After King&apos;s killing, some white soldiers in Vietnam paraded in KKK robes, a Confederate flag was hoisted at another base for three days and the slogan &apos;I&apos;d rather kill a nigger than a gook&apos; (ie the Vietcong) was scrawled on barrack walls. Unlike Bob Hope, who flew in from and straight back to Bangkok, Brown - an honorary lieutenant colonel for the occasion, Brown stayed in Saigon with a slimmed-down version of his band. Just before arriving at their hotel a mortar hit a few doors down the street and killed 17 people. The group proceeded to tour a series of bases aboard a military plane, &apos;harder than any tour I&apos;d ever done&apos;, as Brown later recalled. The reaction from the troops, though, was &apos;incredible ... they found out I wasn&apos;t no Oreo cookie&apos; - that is, black on the outside, white in the middle. Three days after his return, Brown filled the 48,000-capacity Yankee stadium in New York&apos;s Bronx. And on 7 August, Judas of the anti-war movement, he went into a studio in Los Angeles and cut &apos;Say It Loud I&apos;m Black and I&apos;m Proud&apos;. Such is the existential and cultural irony of radical show business. The song became an immediate, huge hit, but Brown dropped it from his live repertoire within a year, disturbed (as he later wrote) that it was perceived as being &apos;militant and angry - maybe because of the line about dying on your feet instead of living on your knees. But really, if you listen to it, it sounds like a children&apos;s song. That&apos;s why I had children in it, so children who heard it could grow up feeling pride ...&apos; And one further, incidental irony: most of the children that Brown was able to recruit for the recording session were white and Asian, with only a few black children included. Given their lead as much by events as from their musical peers, black artists staked their political claims. In 1969, Sly and the Family Stone released &apos;Stand!&apos;: &apos;Stand! For the things you know are right/ It&apos;s the truth that the truth makes them so uptight ... Stand! There&apos;s a midget standing tall/ And the giant beside him about to fall.&apos; That &apos;truth&apos; again, and the music telling it. Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions, who had been preaching the revolutionary truth for years, now released such songs as &apos;Check Out Your Mind&apos; and &apos;Stop The War&apos;; the latter featured on the 1972 album Times Have Changed, which also featured a cover of Marvin Gaye&apos;s &apos;Inner City Blues&apos;. Gaye had become one of Motown&apos;s top-selling entertainers, but now something different happened, with What&apos;s Going On, whereby rage and deep anxiety were spoken, sometimes even seductively whispered, through a musical tapestry which is on the surface easy to listen to, but ultimately disturbing, yearning and a masterpiece of sophistication and innovation. Another &apos;entertainment&apos; group transformed by the events of 1968 were the Temptations, who had been the smash-hit, swinging and swaying masters of love song. But in that year came &apos;Cloud Nine&apos;, which dealt with poverty and abuse driving black youth to drugs, and the remarkable &apos;Ball of Confusion&apos;, lamenting that &apos;Segregation, determination, demonstration, integration, aggravation, humiliation, obligation to our nation/ Ball of confusion/ Oh yeah, that&apos;s what the world is today&apos;. The Temptations bring out a timely re-visitation of their history next month, called Reflections (Universal), and, reflecting, the group&apos;s leader Otis Williams sums it up: &apos;They were turbulent times, and there came a point when you couldn&apos;t ignore what was happening. And yeah, the music had to change.&apos; But, says Williams, &apos;when we sing those songs again on Reflections, I realise that we&apos;re singing about the present, the world is still a Ball of Confusion.&apos; Indeed, the giant in &apos;Stand!&apos; did not fall. Now, when you download those lyrics, you are bombarded by adverts urging you to buy it as a ringtone. Tapping in &apos;Ball of Confusion&apos; admits one to just that: a pandemonium of adverts for &apos;3D chat bubbles&apos;. Hip hop of the sort criticised by Chuck D of Public Enemy is a multi-billion dollar business glorifying the militarisation of the ghetto by gangs. And from the zenith of 1968, although some of his greatest hits like &apos;Sex Machine&apos; and &apos;Hot Pants&apos; were still to come, James Brown&apos;s life, including his political life, embarked on a path towards weirdness and disaster. He began 1969 by playing at President Nixon&apos;s inaugural ball. And while the bombing of Vietnam and Cambodia became one of the war crimes of post-Holocaust history, Brown heartily endorsed the US commander-in-chief of those war crimes, in 1972, the year of the &apos;Black Woodstock&apos; at &apos;Wattstax&apos;. Brown&apos;s concerts were picketed and &apos;James Brown, Nixon&apos;s Clown&apos; became a popular chant. In 1974, he wrote &apos;Funky President&apos; for Gerald Ford, among the un-funkiest Presidents America has ever had - the man of whom LBJ, Brown&apos;s other pal, said: &apos;He has trouble chewing gum and walking at the same time.&apos; But worse was to come. One of the singularities about Brown&apos;s road team during the Sixties was that drugs and alcohol were all but banned; &apos;Nobody got blitzed because you didn&apos;t do that in front of the Godfather,&apos; his manager Alan Leeds recalls. &apos;Anyone of us who wanted to made sure he wasn&apos;t around - that was a ticket home.&apos; Which made it all the more dangerous for Brown to experiment with drugs as he hit middle age, and especially when that drug was PCP. Much has been written about Brown&apos;s descent into drug addiction, depression, grotesque decadence, violence against his wives, self-delusion, and the charges for firearms and car chases for which he was finally jailed again. Little did Brown think before performing at San Quentin prison in 1981 - when he told the NME how scared he was to be there, and how appalled by the uniformity of the prisoners&apos; skin colour - that he would end up behind bars again himself. &apos;Those black kids [the prisoners]&apos;, he also said then, &apos;ain&apos;t ever seen a black president, and nine times out of 10 they won&apos;t ever see one.&apos; The idea was to establish a quasi-Masonic, secret stash, an emergency fund to underwrite the city&apos;s fortunes in an hour of need. The Vault was a shadow city cabinet, with a shadow city budget if the Irish-American political establishment - behind whose various candidates the Vault moved as it wished - spent all the money, which it often did. The Irish-American mayor White distrusted the Anglo Brahmin establishment but in mid-April 1968 he appealed to the Vault to solve what he called his &apos;James Brown problem&apos;. Soon returning from the long table in the Vault&apos;s boardroom to City Hall, he took a call from the Vault&apos;s Charles Coolidge, who said: &apos;Mayor, you have a hundred thousand dollars on account&apos;. One of the Vault, Gilbert Catlin, later explained that &apos;we had some pretty fierce arguments about that James Brown thing, but the mayor persuaded us that if we didn&apos;t come up with the money, the blacks were going to burn the city down&apos;. James Brown was, in the end, paid $15,000, the Vault having arm-wrenched the Garden into waiving its slice of the profits. By the turn of the millennium, the Vault had died off, but Kevin White had become the longest-serving mayor in Boston&apos;s history, from 1968 to 1984; he would recall James Brown as &apos;a bit of a snake-oil salesman.&apos; Tom Atkins became a street hero in the de-segregation of Boston&apos;s schools, and went on to become general counsel of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which for decades remained America&apos;s largest, as well as first, civil rights organisation. Recalling all these events 12 years ago, Atkins described his &apos;preferred way to deal with barriers - knock &apos;em down!&apos;. He admitted to the Boston Globe that he had been to church &apos;thousands of times&apos;, but was not a religious man. &apos;I am not one to sit around and wait for miracles&apos;, he mused. &apos;I believe miracles are usually man-made&apos;. And with James Brown, 40 years ago this April, he pulled one off.

I&apos;ve thought of Borneo to see orang-utans, Costa Rica or Egypt. I adore gospel music and have never been to America, so was wondering if a trip could combine a gospel church with time on the beach.&apos; Budget: \u00a33,000 for two weeks (could be stretched) THE SOLUTION \u00b7 Rachel Varndall from Travel Counsellors: &apos;A combination of New York and Costa Rica would work. Spend four nights in New York at the fantastically located The Pennsylvania Hotel (hotelpenn.com) on a room-only basis. Shireen will love the hotel&apos;s &quot;Harlem on Sunday with Gospel Music&quot; excursion. Then fly to Costa Rica for 10 nights&apos; all-inclusive at the Colon Caribe Hotel in Puerto Viejo De Talamanca. There&apos;s a fresh water pool and kayaks for the beach. They can visit Cahuita National Park with its pristine rainforest and look for howler monkeys and sloths. They might see giant sea turtles nesting on the beaches between July and October. The warm water&apos;s excellent for snorkelling and surfing, and for adventure they could try a tree-top canopy tour and a bit of zip lining! The cost is \u00a33,300 including flights and transfers.&apos; \u00b7 Mark Howard from Travelbag: &apos;A self-drive tour of south-eastern US ticks most of the boxes. Fly to Atlanta for a couple of nights at the Hyatt Place Hotel in Buckhead, from \u00a345pp per night (hyattplace.com) - there&apos;s great shopping and it&apos;s a hip area. An eight-day tour with Travelbag would take in Charleston and Savannah with their Southern-style architecture, Myrtle Beach - one of the nicest beaches in the US - and Jekyll Island, once the playground of the Rockefellers. The trip includes two nights at the Jekyll Island Club (jekyllclub.com), one of America&apos;s finest luxury hotels, as a treat. Back in Atlanta, you can attend the Ebenezer Gospel Chapel (historicebenezer.org). An eight-day self-drive trip would cost around \u00a3500 each, including hotels. Flights to Atlanta with Delta Airlines cost from \u00a3466.&apos; \u00b7 Andrew Appleby from Trailfinders: &apos;Borneo is renowned for its biodiversity, unspoilt beaches and cultural heritage. To suit both of you combine a luxurious eight-night stay at the five-star Shangri-La Tanjung Aru Resort &amp; Spa in Kota Kinabalu (shangri-la.com) with our seven-day &quot;Sabah Supreme&quot; small group tour taking in the Kinabalu National Park, Sepilok orang-utan sanctuary and tropical Gaya Island.

Jessie has learning disabilities and some mobility issues but will have a go at most things. We fancy something outdoorsy, Harry would like to visit a big city and he and Peter enjoy extreme theme park rides. Jessie eats a limited diet, so we usually self-cater. Jessie and I both have &quot;big&quot; birthdays in 2008 - she will be 18 and I will be 50 - so a bit of hotel luxury would be a great birthday treat.&apos; Budget: \u00a33,500 but could be pushed THE SOLUTION \u00b7 Kristina Hume from Travel by Design: &apos;They&apos;ll need to stretch the budget, but Toronto plus Rice Lake, 90 miles away, would be ideal. Fly to Toronto and stay three nights at the Metropolitan Hotel (00 1 416 977 5000; metropolitan.com/toronto). Visit the CN Tower, and the Wonderland theme park, or take a day trip to Niagara. Then drive to the Elmhirst Resort on Rice Lake (00 1 800 461 1940; elmhirst.com) for eight nights in a cottage. Activities such as canoeing, windsurfing and horseriding are included in the price. With flights and car hire this 11-night trip would cost \u00a35,036 in July.&apos; \u00b7 Mark Howard from Travelbag: &apos;Florida has plenty of outdoor possibilities and great theme parks without too long a flight. They could base themselves in Naples and explore. Sanibel Island has stunning beaches and amazing birdlife, Tampa is nearby for the city &quot;fix&quot;, while Busch Gardens is a brilliant zoo with amazing rides. Orlando is only an hour away by car. Wet&apos;n&apos;Wild has scary slides as well as a lazy river ride and just round the corner is a skydiving simulator. They could explore the Florida Everglades on an airboat tour through the swamps outside Kissimmee - and spot alligators. A week in a four-bedroom villa with pool in Naples would cost about \u00a3900 and allow them to self-cater. As a treat, add a couple of nights at the five-star Ritz Carlton Hotel in Naples (00 1 239 598 3300; ritzcarlton.com). Flights to Tampa or Orlando would cost around \u00a3500 each, car hire \u00a3250.&apos; \u00b7 Barry Moxley from Traveltime: &apos;What about New England? Fly to Boston for a few days: walk the Freedom Trail, visit the aquarium and take a Duck tour in a amphibious vehicle. Then head to the coast or inland, or both, by car, dividing time between Vermont and Cape Cod. An operator such as 1st Class Holidays (0161 877 0432; 1stclassholidays.com) will tailor-make a holiday. They could include a stay at an historic New England inn such as the Cortina (cortinainn.com) in Vermont or the Falmouth on Cape Cod (falmouthinn.com) for whale watching. Air fares are around \u00a3600. If you keep to your \u00a33,500 budget you will have around \u00a31,200 for accommodation and car hire. Some inns cost about \u00a350, and with the strong pound you will get good value.

We&apos;d thought about a weekend away without the kids but the guilt of leaving them got to us, so now we&apos;re looking for a week away in October half term or two weeks at Christmas. We&apos;d like an adventure and to meet locals and thought of Jordan or Morocco. We like walking, cycling and animals and want warm weather and reasonable flight times, but what&apos;s essential is that it is something special and memorable. The boys like snorkelling, so a few days on the coast would be great.&apos; Budget: \u00a35,000 or more if really special THE SOLUTION  \u00b7 Kristina Hume from Travel by Design: &apos;Explore&apos;s &quot;Kasbahs and Camels&quot; tour to Morocco (0844 499 0901; explore.co.uk) would be perfect. &apos;Accommodation is not deluxe but it&apos;s authentic and includes a night camping under the stars and a night in a village house. &apos;The 11-day trip covers the Sahara and the Atlas mountains and you get to see the real Morocco and meet Berbers and experience the madness of Marrakesh with its acrobats and snake charmers in central Djemma el-Fna square. The landscape of southern Morocco is dotted with ancient mud forts, dunes, oases, sleepy villages and inviting beaches, and there&apos;s the chance to explore by four-wheel-drive or even camel. &apos;They&apos;d also visit the Atlas Film Studios in Ouarzazate, birthplace of Gladiator and Lawrence of Arabia, which would be fun too. The total price would be \u00a32,936.&apos; \u00b7 Bob Atkinson from Travelsupermarket.com: &apos;How about Egypt with The Adventure Company (0845 4505311; adventurecompany.co.uk) on its 10-day &quot;Feluccas and Pharaohs&quot; trip, departing around 24 October or at Christmas? They&apos;ll visit Cairo, Luxor, Aswan and Hurghada, sail the Nile, sleep on a felucca and see the sights, from the Pyramids and the Sphinx to Karnak Temple and the Pharaoh tombs in Luxor. They&apos;ll have dinner with a Nubian family - meeting the locals indeed! - and ride camels in the desert. They can finish on the Red Sea for snorkelling and diving. &apos;The weather will be warm but not too hot and the flight times are reasonable, at just over four hours. They won&apos;t need malaria drugs, either. Prices are from \u00a3979 for adults, \u00a3899 for children, and they could even extend their stay a few extra days within budget.&apos; \u00b7 Rachel Varndall from Travel Counsellors: &apos;With its spectacular desert scenery and archaeological treasures, Jordan could be just what they&apos;re after. They can explore the &quot;lost city&quot; of Petra and camp under the stars in Wadi Rum after a camel ride in the desert and swim and float in the Red and Dead seas. &apos;Exodus (0845 863 9600; exodus.co.uk) has a nine-day holiday starting in Amman, before heading south to the Dead Sea for a &quot;float&quot; in the salty water. They visit Mount Nebo, where Moses was shown the &quot;promised land&quot; and Kerac, a crusader castle. &apos;Then it&apos;s off to Wadi Rum and the desert - the location for much of the film Lawrence of Arabia. The night skies are spectacular and there&apos;s a desert camping adventure under the stars, and the chance to ride camels. Then there&apos;s time on the coast at Aqaba, for snorkelling in the Red Sea. &apos;They then return to Amman, visiting the Roman city of Jerash on the way. The trip leaves on 20 December and costs \u00a33,856, with flights, accommodation, activities and tours.&apos; The Asia stopover &apos;ADVENTURE ON OUR WAY TO OZ&apos; Liz Wilson, 47, a teaching assistant from London, will travel with partner Jon Goldsmith, who runs a film production company, and their three children Jaimie, 15, Ali, 13 and Jojo, nine THE BRIEF: &apos;We are a family of five, with two hormonal teenage boys who need adventure and a nine-year old girl who loves animals and the beach. We&apos;re going to Australia in August for my dad&apos;s 80th and would like a 10 or 12-day stopover in Asia, probably Vietnam or Cambodia. We will have flights stopping in Singapore, so need advice on getting to Vietnam or Cambodia and the best way to travel around. We like adventure, no big hotels. &apos; Budget: About \u00a33,000 THE SOLUTION \u00b7 Ben Briggs from Travelmood: &apos;If they fly with Singapore Airlines, there are some excellent add-on fares from Singapore to Vietnam for around \u00a3130 return. Our 13-day &quot;Good Morning Vietnam&quot; family adventure is designed for families who want to escape mass tourism. It starts in Hanoi on 9 August and ends in Saigon. After Hanoi, you travel to Halong Bay for a boat trip. Then you take the Vietnam Reunification Express train to Hue, the cultural capital, where you will travel along the Perfume River to visit the tombs of the Nguyen dynasty. Then there are three nights in the old port of Hoi An and a night with a family in the Mekong Delta, and they&apos;ll travel by boat along rural waterways, finishing in Saigon. The price is \u00a3799 per person.&apos; \u00b7 Daniel Robinson from Lonely Planet: &apos;I suggest focusing on Cambodia. Quantas-affiliated Jetstar (jetstar.com) and Singapore Airlines-owned SilkAir (silkair.com) offer cheap flights (about \u00a355) from Singapore. Fly into Siem Reap and start with the temples of Angkor, sure to remind your teenagers of Raiders of the Lost Ark. A relaxing hotel with a very Cambodian vibe is Angkor Village (angkorvillage.com; double room from \u00a350). Le Tigre de Papier restaurant offers Khmer cooking courses. Travel by boat (six to nine hours) to Cambodia&apos;s second city, Battambang, known for its French architecture and a great base for exploring the countryside. La Villa (lavilla-battambang.com; double room \u00a325) has a 1930s ambience, but book early. Finish with a few days in Phnom Penh. Don&apos;t miss the Royal Palace, the Russian Market and the &quot;killing fields&quot; of Choeung Ek.&apos; \u00b7 Mark Howard from Travelbag: &apos;Our eight-day &quot;Mountains and Monks&quot; tour covers the highlights of Laos. You start in Vientiane, one of the most characterful capitals in South East Asia. Nearby is rural Vang Vieng with great cafe culture, where you can tube downriver and explore caves. Luang Prabang is picture perfect and has a great night market. Nearby you can swim in the waterfalls at Kuang Si. Cooking classes can also be arranged. Accommodation is in three-star hotels in main cities but you get a night at Kamu Lodge, a tent-style eco-lodge. You take a boat down the Mekong river to the Pak Ou caves of a Thousand Buddhas and, after a picnic, continue to the lodge where you can fish, pan for gold, try archery and learn about your &quot;Kamu&quot; hosts. There will be opportunities to see elephants too. The tour includes all sightseeing, a guide and transfers. It costs from \u00a3765 for adults, \u00a3570 for children. Flights extra.&apos; The cool adventure &apos;KEEPING IT ALL TOGETHER AS A SINGLE PARENT&apos; Elizabeth Gant, 40, and daughter Alex, seven, from Hampton, Middlesex THE BRIEF: &apos;We are looking for a summer holiday with a bit of soft adventure. My daughter is energetic but doesn&apos;t like it too hot (certainly nowhere it&apos;s regularly over 30C). We don&apos;t need a beach, but the chance to swim sometimes is pretty much essential. I&apos;d be travelling as a single parent and it would be great to have adult company some of the time, so we&apos;d have no problem with a group trip. We don&apos;t need luxury but need to go in the school holidays.&apos; Budget: \u00a31,200 for a week THE SOLUTION  \u00b7 Rachel Varndall from Travel Counsellors: &apos;The Adventure Company (adventurecompany.co.uk) has an ideal group trip to Slovakia, a beautiful country of lakes and mountains with a climate similar to the UK in the summer. Based in the lovely village of Terchova, they&apos;ll stay in a pension within walking distance of shops and restaurants. Daily activities, designed with children in mind, include gentle rafting, a horse and carriage ride and a farm visit. They can try traditional crafts and games, enjoy a steam train ride and visit Orava Castle and local thermal pools. There is plenty of free time too. Some meals are included (promising company for Elizabeth), but some nights you do your own thing. The cost including flights, accommodation and all activities is \u00a31,368 for seven nights.&apos; \u00b7 Bob Atkinson from travelsupermarket.com: &apos;Singleparentsonholiday.co.uk (0871 550 4053) has the perfect holiday, something that&apos;s a real treat yet within budget - a &quot;Fun &amp; Adventure&quot; holiday to the Austrian Alps in May half term (departing 24/25 May or 30May/1 Jun). There&apos;s walking, rafting, mountain biking and a full children&apos;s activity programme including cable car trips, and you stay at a hotel with a heated indoor pool. Temperatures should be in the high 20s and you can visit nearby Salzburg to fulfil any aspirations you have to become Maria in the Sound of Music! It costs \u00a3925 for two half-board, including most activities. They would need to fly to Salzburg, with flights from around \u00a3140.&apos; \u00b7 Kristina Hume from Travel by Design: &apos;Jersey&apos;s perfect, not too hot, with lots to do. The three-star Merton Hotel (0870 486 7425; seymourhotels.com), has a water park and an all-weather leisure complex and is 10 minutes&apos; stroll from the beach at Havre des Pas. The hotel&apos;s really geared up for children: they get a free kids&apos; zone pack, with beach bag, cap and games, and there&apos;s a kids&apos; club in the evening from 6-9.30pm, so Elizabeth could have some free time, and may meet other single parents too. The hotel has a Jersey Blue Badge Guide who can take you on guided walks, from beach safaris to coastal hikes. Seven nights, with flights, would cost around \u00a31,280.&apos; The eco-scuba trip &apos;WE&apos;RE VEGGIES BUT DON&apos;T WANT TO VEGETATE&apos; Hilary Groombridge, 51, a staff development manager, lives in Hertfordshire with husband Nic, 54, a university lecturer, and son Rhys, 13 THE BRIEF: &apos;We want a holiday where Nic and Rhys can use their recently acquired scuba qualifications, but want to get there without flying. Is this possible? We&apos;d be interested in other adventurous water sports too, maybe with some sailing tuition. We&apos;d like a nice hotel and some alternative activities if possible, such as walking, yoga, pilates or art classes. I should mention we are all vegetarian.&apos; Budget: Ideally \u00a33,000 total but could stretch to \u00a31,500 each for a week or so THE SOLUTION  \u00b7 Rachel Varndall from Travel Counsellors: &apos;The Scilly Isles offers some of the finest diving in the UK. Start with two nights at the Atlantic Hotel (01720 422417; smallandfriendly.co.uk) on St Mary&apos;s, the largest island. There are lovely walks and opportunities for sailing, golf and horse-riding . Head to St Martin&apos;s, very unspoilt, for two nights at the St Martin&apos;s on the Isle Hotel (01720 422090; stmartinshotel.co.uk). The Isles of Scilly Dive School (01720 422848; scillydiving.com; single dives from \u00a336) is here and you can dive with seals or wreck dive if you&apos;re more experienced. Then head back to St Mary&apos;s to the Bell Rock Hotel (bellrockhotel.co.uk; 01720 422575) for three nights. Departing on 25 July from Penzance, this costs \u00a33,357 with boat transfers and hotels on a half-board basis, excluding dives.&apos; \u00b7 Bob Atkinson from travelsupermarket.com: &apos;The Italian Riviera offers diving in the Portofino National Marine Reserve. Londonscuba.com (07000 272822) can tailor-make diving trips, staying at the Hotel Europa in Santa Margherita (00 39 185 287187; hoteleuropa-sml.it). Then move to a hotel in Portofino and go walking on the stunning coastline. Travel would involve Eurostar to Paris and on to Turin or Milan, with local connections to Genoa. A 10-day break in June or late August/September should be within the \u00a33,000 including B&amp;B accommodation and a couple of days&apos; diving. Rail fares would be extra, with fares from around \u00a3200, through raileurope (raileurope.co.uk).&apos; \u00b7 Barry Moxley from Traveltime: &apos;St Tropez offers good diving as well as windsurfing, tennis, aerobics, jet skiing and sailing. Dive Worldwide (0845 130 6980; diveworldwide.com) offers accommodation in beach bungalows at Tiki Hutte. Seven nights costs \u00a3965 per person, based on three people sharing in July, including 10 dives each with the on-site dive centre. Rail travel would cost \u00a3100-\u00a3150 each return.&apos; The toddler challenge &apos;WHAT WILL BE REALISTIC WITH LITTLE ONES?&apos; Anna Youngs, 36, a yoga teacher, lives in Cambridge with husband Dave, 40, an IT contractor, and daughter Rosie, 20 months. Her second child is due in May THE BRIEF: &apos;We want to go to Australia in September for two or three months with Rosie, who will be two and four months, and our second baby, who will be four months. We&apos;ve done a lot of adventurous travel and want to see what will be realistic with children. We&apos;d like to see as much as possible and would like advice on accommodation and getting around. I want to enjoy Sydney, but also experience the natural beauty of Australia. Is it better to stop over en route for a few days?&apos; Budget: Up to \u00a38,000 THE SOLUTION  \u00b7 Mark Howard from Travelbag: &apos;I would advise stopping off as it doesn&apos;t add much to the price; Singapore is probably the most child-friendly option. In Australia self-catering apartments prove good value, and hiring a car&apos;s a good way to explore with a family. Start in Sydney at The Medina (medina.com.au), from \u00a334 per person (the children stay for free). Then explore New South Wales with a couple of days in the Blue Mountains, followed by the Hunter Valley wine region, before meandering up the coast. Byron Bay has idyllic beaches and rainforests. Stay at Peppers Casuarina (peppers.com.au) from \u00a360pp, or the Vibe Gold Coast Hotel (vibehotel.com.au) at Surfer&apos;s Paradise from \u00a328pp. They could either travel up the Queensland coast to the Great Barrier Reef, or continue to Western Australia, using a BA/Qantas ticket which allows you to fly into Sydney, go overland to Brisbane or Cairns and then fly to Perth. The Mounts Bay Waters Apartment Hotel (mounts-bay.com.au) in Perth costs \u00a323pp for a two-bed apartment. Six weeks&apos; car hire would cost just under \u00a31,000. The flights would cost \u00a3904 plus tax for adults, \u00a3678 for Rosie and \u00a398 for the infant for two internal flights plus a stopover each way.&apos; \u00b7 Ben Briggs from Travelmood: &apos;I would recommend stopping over en route. Qantas offers stopovers in Bangkok, Singapore, Hong Kong or Bali and has a fare called Dreamtime Plus, which includes two domestic flights in Australia. For September this would be \u00a3826 plus tax for an adult, \u00a3619 for the toddler and \u00a383 for the infant. How about hiring a motorhome for some of the time? The Maui Spirit 6 would cost \u00a3114 a day for 21 days or more. Combine it with an apartment stay in, say, Port Douglas, in Queensland. The Bay Villas Resort (bayvillasresort.com) offers a week in a two-bed apartment for \u00a3650. \u00b7 Andrew Appleby from Trailfinders:&apos;Trailfinders recommends an &apos;open-jaw&apos; ticket: for example, Cathay Pacific via Hong Kong offers flights to Adelaide, returning three months later from Cairns, from \u00a3759 per adult. A child ticket would cost from \u00a3625 and an infant ticket from \u00a3315. They could travel the south coast from Adelaide to Melbourne on the Great Ocean Road, up to Sydney, then north to Brisbane and Queensland, finishing in Cairns. A motorhome would allow you to travel at your own pace. Daily rates in September start from \u00a3102 for less than 21 days or \u00a386 for 28 days or more.&apos; THE PANEL \u00b7 Rachel Varndall works for Travel Counsellors (0800 195 8852; travelcounsellors.co.uk) \u00b7 Kristina Hume is managing partner of Travel by Design (01625 584195; travelbydesigngroup.com) \u00b7 Bob Atkinson is product manager at Travelsupermarket.com \u00b7 Andrew Appleby is marketing executive at Trailfinders (0845 050 5945; trailfinders.co.uk) \u00b7 Mark Howard is a specialist travel consultant from Travelbag Brighton (0870 814 6252; travelbag.co.uk) \u00b7 Ben Briggs is marketing executive at Travelmood (0800 840 8305; www.travelmood.com) \u00b7 Daniel Robinson co-wrote Lonely Planet&apos;s Cambodia guide \u00b7 Barry Moxley is MD of Traveltime (01753 889088; traveltimegroup.co.uk).

Martin, a nervy lawyer, says he has stories to tell, but is worried that they might be stolen. The other, who says he is a publisher and whose grandfather was in the SS, is writing the stories down. But who is to say what is true in this slippery world of unreliable narrators? It becomes clear that this telling of stories owes more to the Hollywood pitch than to friendship. Indeed, part of the interest here is in the dynamic between two deeply unpleasant men who, in revealing everything, reveal nothing. They needle each other and yet never make any connection. The bathhouse, with its gurgling water and steam, is like a hell where these lost souls drift. Stories, we often think, define us. In the theatre, in particular, the idea of sharing stories in the dark is held up as something fundamental that makes us human. But what if all our stories have been misappropriated? What if we can no longer distinguish between Ariel Sharon and Sharon Stone, between One Day in September and a real terrorist attack? What if the Holocaust is no longer a historical event in our minds but a TV miniseries? That ordinary lives are not worth hearing about unless they can be packaged into a misery memoir?

Few people are sure exactly why that was the focal point of the attack - one theory can be found here - but it seems that it extended little further than his slightly emaciated, professorial appearance. The only defence of this awful terrace abuse can be that it had a tinge of subversion, on account of the general paedophile hysteria taking place in wider British society. Even this is scraping the barrel, though, and it&apos;s astonishing that the chants continue to be heard, particularly loudly on Saturday February 16 at Old Trafford, where Manchester United were drubbing Wenger&apos;s charges 4-0. It was all the more disappointing, coming a week after United marked the 50th anniversary of the Munich tragedy. Why is this kind of stuff tolerated by the football authorities, who - rightly - think nothing of meting out harsh punishments to clubs whose fans sing racist chants? Why is there no indignation in the media? To call someone a paedophile, in case people have forgotten, is to publicly abuse them as someone who would sexually abuse those under the age of consent. Why should anyone have to tolerate this kind of stuff? Sure, managers have to be thick-skinned, but this clearly goes far beyond the limits of what is acceptable. For those who think this is an internal football matter, remember that the terraces are as much an expression of wider culture as any other place. Certain types of abuse are beyond the pale, while others are tolerated. Homophobia, for example, is fair game (itself a complicated issue, given that only a homophobe would be offended by the epithet &quot;gay&quot;, although it is clear that chants of that nature are intended as an insult); and Spurs fans are given free rein to call themselves (self-deprecatingly?) Yids, while at the same time missing the irony in calling Sol Campbell a &quot;Judas cunt with HIV&quot;. This is not a freedom-of-speech issue: a football stadium isn&apos;t Speakers&apos; Corner. The club&apos;s only responsibility is to ensure that the supporters are able to watch the football in as safe and positive an environment as possible. By all means, jeer the players for their failings. God knows, they earn so much money they should be able to take it. But that simply shouldn&apos;t include racist, sexist, and homophobic abuse - or calling Ars\u00e8ne Wenger a paedophile. The Premier League should spend a little less time on its crazy idea of bringing the Liverpool derby to Bangkok and a little more time clamping down on offenders. Footballers themselves are becoming aware that red lines are being crossed, particularly in the aftermath of the abuse England players received following a dire display in Andorra, and a spirited discussion has begun to emerge regarding what to do about the problem. On one level, it is astonishing that the situation has got this bad. This is post-Hillsborough, after all, with the hooliganism of the 1980s but a distant memory. In the era of sanitised, all-seater stadiums catering to the bourgeoisie&apos;s every need, how has it come to this? As Tevye the Milkman famously said, I don&apos;t know. But I do know something can be done about it. There are many penalties, ranging from docking points or forcing clubs to play behind closed doors. That can stop this kind of stuff. Here, managers have a particular responsibility. Brian Clough famously banned his players from disputing a referee&apos;s decision, however controversial it was. If a manager of the stature of Sir Alex Ferguson asks his fans not to call Ars\u00e8ne Wenger a paedophile, the vast majority of them will comply with his request. As long as the abuse is tolerated, however, it will only grow, to the shame of football fans everywhere.", "publicationDate": "2008-02-21T14:00:00Z", "tags": ["Football"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/21/crossingredlines", "title": "Crossing red lines", "sentences": ["The Premier League should spend a little less time on its crazy idea of bringing the Liverpool derby to Bangkok and a little more time clamping down on offenders."]}, {"article": "The Manchester City owner Thaksin Shinawatra is expected to return from exile to Thailand tomorrow in an attempt to clear his name. &quot;I think and I believe that Thaksin will return on the 28th,&quot; said the Thai foreign minister Noppadon Pattama of the country&apos;s former prime minister, who was ousted in a bloodless 2006 coup and is wanted on a corruption charge relating to his wife&apos;s purchase of a prime piece of Bangkok real estate while in office.

Thaksin - who in the intervening time bought up Manchester City football club - is due to step off a Thai International Airways flight from Hong Kong shortly before 10am to be greeted by faithful followers and government ministers. The 58-year-old billionaire tycoon, who has spent most of his exile in London, will also be met at Bangkok&apos;s international airport by Thai police, who are due to serve an arrest warrant on corruption charges. Thaksin reiterated his pledge to quit politics for good hours before his return. &quot;I&apos;ve had enough,&quot; he said. &quot;The country has returned to democracy, so I want to go home ... I miss my motherland.&quot; However, opponents of the divisive former prime minister, who still commands fierce loyalty among the rural poor, fear his return could propel the country into fresh uncertainty as Thaksin vies with his proxy, the prime minister Samak Sundaravej. But Thailand&apos;s royalist-military elite, which staged the September 2006 coup to get rid of Thaksin while he visited the UN in New York, remains chastened by the experience of watching its popularity evaporate. The government drifted and its anointed party took a drubbing in last December&apos;s polls when the People Power party, the successor to Thaksin&apos;s disbanded Thai Rak Thai party, took charge of a six-party coalition. The widely rumoured corruption allegations used as the imperative for bringing down Thaksin failed to materialise in any significant way despite an exhaustive inquiry by government committees. Loyalists envisage a tumultuous homecoming with crowds of up to 10,000 supporters expected. But Rakkiat Wattapong, the supreme court secretary general, said Thaksin would be arrested on arrival on a warrant issued last September. Thaksin&apos;s chief legal adviser, Pichit Chuenban, said he would surrender and seek bail.  Thaksin is jointly charged with his wife, Pojaman, who returned in January. Both face up to 13 years in jail over corruption charges relating to Pojaman&apos;s purchase of a piece of Bangkok land at a favourable price from a government agency while Thaksin was in office.

Which must be why Human Rights FC owner Thaksin Shinawatra arrived home in Thailand today - where he was immediately arrested on corruption charges - flanked by none other than big-name HRFC duo Kasper the Friendly Goalkeeper and Kelvin Etuhu, who were chosen because of their failure to make it into the first team and were in no way whatsoever so help the Fiver God playing the role of political pawns in a situation far murkier than they can ever hope to understand. (The Fiver hasn&apos;t the foggiest either, but let&apos;s not split hairs.) After Thaksin emerged from Bangkok&apos;s supreme court celebrating bail - a snip at \u00a3132,000! - and protesting his innocence through mouthfuls of champagne, the Friendly Goalkeeper boldly spoke for politically sensitive HRFC fans the world over. &quot;He&apos;s a very genuine and a very nice person,&quot; he automatoned of the man once described by Human Rights Watch as a &quot;human-rights abuser of the worst kind&quot;. &quot;He&apos;s willing to put in time, money and effort to make sure the club&apos;s a success ... but not necessarily in that order,&quot; added Schmeichel. Actually, he didn&apos;t really say that last bit. But oh, if he had ... Back in Blighty, Sven-Goran Eriksson was busy burrowing his shiny bonce under the nearest carpet and hoping Shinawatra returns very soon with skipfuls of cash. &quot;His support and involvement with the club is nothing to do with [the situation in] Thailand,&quot; he whimpered. Thaksin obviously agreed. Swatting aside trifling questions such as &quot;What do you think of the PPP [People Power Party]?&quot; and &quot;Will you give them any policy advice?&quot;, he seized the moment following HRFC&apos;s dismal 2-0 defeat to Everton on Monday night at Fortress Eastlands to unveil his plans for world domination. &quot;It will be the team Thais are proud of,&quot; he announced to a backdrop of one bemused granny waving a placard of Shinawatra in a HRFC shirt. &quot;There will be Man City China, Man City Japan, Man City US.&quot; And if the prospect of hearing Blue Moon being murdered by the inhabitants of Shanghai, Tokyo and Oklahoma was not enough to get the juices flowing throughout the non-red half of Manchester, Shinawatra expertly hammered the final nail in the coffin. &quot;In the next season, Man City will be another Man United,&quot; he droned rather tactlessly.

Tennis Unseeded Murray draws Federer Andy Murray&apos;s bid to move back into the world&apos;s top 10 took a knock when he was drawn against top seed Roger Federer in the first round of the Barclays Dubai Open this week. Murray was unseeded despite the Scot being ranked number 12 in the world. The Dubai Open, which starts tomorrow, is such an affluent tournament that it pays the biggest appearance money on the tour and this year has attracted eight of the top 10. Yet as a third-rank event, below Grand Slams and Masters Series, it has only a 32-player draw and, therefore, only eight seeds. However, Murray beat Federer the last time they met. That was in the Masters Series event in Cincinnati 19 months ago, though it is possible that the memory of that will galvanise the world number one, who beat Murray the previous year in the Bangkok final.

But Andy Murray has always been a little bit different. Laconic as ever, Murray viewed the most extraordinary first-round draw that any tournament during 2008 is likely to throw up with something approaching languor. &quot;I was sleeping when the draw was done,&quot; he explained. &quot;And I got a text message and looked at it and went back to sleep.&quot; The Scot, drawling as if almost ready to drop off again, went on: &quot;I wasn&apos;t panicking about it or worrying about it. It&apos;s a difficult draw but I&apos;m really excited to get the chance to play against Federer.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s been such a long time since I played him,&quot; he added with a bit of useful psychology, reminding himself that when they last met, 19 months ago on a boiling-hot day in Cincinnati, he was the winner. Today&apos;s rematch at the Dubai Championships should give a wonderful opportunity for Murray to test his potential to become, one day, the first British man in 72 years to win a grand slam singles title. Murray has won two tournaments this year, more or less completely recovered from the wrist injury which spoiled so much of 2007 for him, and would quite like to prove once and for all that his first-round defeat by Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the Australian Open was no more than another tough draw. &quot;I have definitely improved [since the match in Cincinnati], no question about that,&quot; Murray said. &quot;Federer didn&apos;t play his best match that day. But I have a good game which can cause guys problems. It&apos;s important to do it on the match court.&quot; This draw is the outcome of one of the tour&apos;s stranger anomalies. The Dubai tournament pays so much appearance money that it attracts a grand-slam standard top 20, but it remains officially a third-level event which means it has a 32-man draw and only eight seeds. With eight of the top 10 here, the 2007 runner-up and world No11, Mikhail Youzhny, is also unseeded. But Federer, four times the champion here, will still want to win it as much as some Masters Series events. Having played only one tournament all year, he needs to win. &quot;It&apos;s only my second tournament in four months. Hopefully this time I will be feeling better,&quot; Federer said, referring to his off-colour period in January which saw him lose in the semi-finals to the eventual champion Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open. &quot;I knew the draw would be difficult, and this time it is particularly so because my opponent is so highly ranked [Murray is the world No12], and last time I lost to him. &quot;He is on the rise - I am always expecting him to do well. He has won two tournaments and I have not even played two tournaments yet this year.&quot; The great man even allowed himself to sound vulnerable. Murray, meanwhile, joined other leading players in admitting that the difficulties of playing in the Davis Cup could be reduced if the format were modified, and especially if it were not to take place after grand-slam events. &quot;Has it been controversial?&quot; Murray joked about the furore which followed his withdrawal from the recent Great Britain tie against Argentina in Buenos Aires. &quot;I am still comfortable with my decision. It was obviously a difficult one and I knew there would be things said, I knew there would be repercussions. But I did what I thought was right. I did what I thought was necessary - not to have niggles, not to let my ranking slip. Winning Marseille at least made me feel better.&quot; But his principal interest had clearly become tonight&apos;s match with Federer. &quot;He&apos;s beaten much better players than me and had much better matches, but for him it&apos;s an important match too,&quot; Murray said. &quot;So we will see how my game matches up against the best in the world. And when I come off court I&apos;m bound to have a lot to work on after a match like this.&quot; He was not quite prepared to go as far as Rafael Nadal, the second seed in the other half here and Murray&apos;s friend from his Barcelona-based days. &quot;Andy has potential to be one, two or three in the world, so for sure he can beat Roger,&quot; the Spaniard said.

If your name is Frank Lampard, this list of Things That Ought To be Taken Very Seriously Indeed suffers from at least one glaring omission: Frank Lampard. So oh how the Fiver will guffaw if the unbelievably self-important footballer&apos;s appeal against the red card he incurred against West Ham on Saturday is, like Jeremie Aliadi\u00e8re&apos;s similar plea last week, dismissed on the grounds of being &quot;frivolous&quot; - for there is probably no greater insult you could direct at His Lampness. Chelsea brought this amusing scenario closer today by confirming they&apos;re requesting that the expulsion be rescinded. Word is that they think they&apos;ll get satisfaction too, because television footage contains no evidence of His Lampness slapping Luis Boa Morte - which is allegedly what assistant ref Guy Beale thought he saw him do before advising big boss ref Peter Walton to send him off. The fact that the footage contains clear evidence of one of the club&apos;s highest-paid professionals falling heavily on his prostrate opponent and thrusting his legs aggressively towards him before springing up and shoving him like a playground wuss is, apparently, irrelevant. Presumably the appeal is a matter of principle - certainly Chelsea can&apos;t be worried about the prospect of His Lampness missing matches against the might Barnsley, the mighty, mighty Ramsbottom County and the mighty, mighty, mighty Sunderland. Or perhaps there&apos;s more to it than that? Yes, perhaps Avram Grant is secretly hoping the ban will be extended like Aliadi\u00e8re&apos;s - so the manager won&apos;t have to do what he didn&apos;t have the balls to do in the Carling Cup final: drop him for a clash with Spurs. &quot;I don&apos;t get involved in all the dramas surrounding the club,&quot; jibbered Joe Cole today on the subject of all the dramas surrounding the club. &quot;My job is to try to perform as well as I can when I get selected,&quot; he continued, adding nothing to our understanding of events but temporarily sating our very media-esque thirst for any ole celebrity quote. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;No one dictates what the player can do as long as he stays within the laws of the game, as long as it doesn&apos;t result in a caution&quot; - a statement from Everton moves to defuse criticism of their goalscoring Antipodean Tim Cahill for celebrating by crossing his wrists as if handcuffed in a show of support to his brother, who was sentenced to six years in prison for GBH in January. ********************* FRAILTY, THY NAME IS GAME 39 If the beautiful dream that is Game 39, which has had more boots stuck in it than Manolo Blahnik&apos;s shoe cupboard, wasn&apos;t dead already, it is today after radical firebrand and Uefa president Michel Platini launched his 383rd attack on the idea, before running it over with a steamroller, setting it on fire, putting out the fire with a jet of special water, and then spreading rumours about its mother&apos;s promiscuity. Oh, and then having a jaunty dig at perfidious Albion. &quot;English clubs are in debt and are therefore always looking for new sources of profit to cope,&quot; said Platini with the kind of sweeping generalisation that&apos;s typical coming from a Frenchman. &quot;When I see a Premier League club where the president, the coach and players are not English, again, I am sceptical.&quot; That wasn&apos;t all though, oh no. Michel believes Game 39 threatens the very fabric of society itself, which, if you&apos;re some poor resident of Bangkok forced to sit through Chelsea v Bolton, is probably true. &quot;Twenty years ago, people said it was necessary to play sport to stay healthy. Today, it is to play for cash. Football is not just a product, it is the bearer of values, it has a social impact.

I think I have shown tonight that&apos;s not going to be an issue.&quot; He saw his win as coming not so much from his tactics, which were based on patience early on, nor on improved fitness, but on his mentality. &quot;The most important thing is to believe you can win the match,&quot; Murray said. &quot;I have watched him so many times and he&apos;s a special player - possibly the greatest of all time. &quot;Too many times early in a tournament guys try to play too well [but] it&apos;s important to stay patient and not make rash decisions early in the match.

Viktor Bout, who has been accused by both the UN and Amnesty International of flouting arms embargos, was arrested at a five-star hotel in central Bangkok after a Thai court issued an arrest warrant, said Lieutenant General Pongpat Chayapan, of Thailand&apos;s police. According to Thai officials, the warrant was based on an earlier one issued by the US drug enforcement administration. A US embassy spokesman congratulated Thailand on the arrest but gave no further details. Bout made no comment as he was paraded before the media at the Bangkok police headquarters.  Officers had been pursuing him for months. The 41-year-old former Russian KGB officer allegedly sold armaments to anyone with the cash to pay, including forces in the Taliban and various warring sides in more than a dozen African countries. Russia will seek Bout&apos;s extradition, according to one official in Moscow quoted by the RIA Novosti news agency. Bout is already subject to an international arrest warrant originating from Belgium. According to UN reports, Bout&apos;s arms smuggling network included more than 50 aircraft around the world. His activities were chronicled in a book, Merchant of Death, published last year by two US investigative journalists. Bout was also the reported inspiration for a 2005 film, Lord of War, in which Nicholas Cage played a cynical arms dealer. The book about Bout claimed that planes from the arms dealer&apos;s fleet made several airdrops of weapons to Farc guerrillas between December 1998 and April 1999. Colonel Petcharat Sengchai, another Thai police officer, told reporters Bout had been wanted on charges of &quot;procuring weapons and explosives for Colombian rebels&quot;, namely the Revolutionary Armed Forced of Colombia, or Farc. This week Farc has been at the centre of Latin America&apos;s most serious international crisis for years, with Ecuador and Venezuela breaking diplomatic ties with Colombia and deploying troops to border regions. The crisis began on Saturday when a Colombian air raid killed more than 20 Farc rebels, including a senior leader, at a base just inside Ecuadorean territory. Colombia, which has battled the Marxist group for more than 40 years, hit back at criticism from its neighbours by claiming computer files seized from the Farc base showed Ecuador and Venezuela colluded closely with the group. Although Bout has been investigated by police in several countries, he has never been prosecuted for arms dealing. A 2005 report by Amnesty International alleged Bout was &quot;the most prominent foreign businessman&quot; involved in trafficking arms to UN-embargoed destinations from Bulgaria, Slovakia, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan and other countries. The same year, the US treasury department named 30 companies and four people it said were connected to Bout&apos;s operations, placing them under sanction. In October 2006, President George Bush issued an executive order freezing assets belonging to Bout and several associates, and barring Americans from doing business with them. According to a US treasury department statement on Bout&apos;s activities, he built up his arms empire after the collapse of the Soviet Union, acquiring a fleet of surplus or obsolete planes.  &quot;Today, Bout has the capacity to transport tanks, helicopters and weapons by the tonnes to virtually any point in the world,&quot; the statement said. &quot;The arms he has sold or brokered has helped fuel conflicts and support UN sanctioned regimes in Afghanistan, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Sudan.&quot; The US government claims he made a $50m (\u00a325m) profit supplying military equipment to the Taliban in Afghanistan before the regime was overthrown.", "publicationDate": "2008-03-06T16:32:30Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Russia", "Colombia", "Arms trade", "World news", "Europe", "Americas", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/06/thailand.russia", "title": "Thai police arrest suspected 'Merchant of Death' arms dealer", "sentences": ["Viktor Bout, who has been accused by both the UN and Amnesty International of flouting arms embargos, was arrested at a five-star hotel in central Bangkok after a Thai court issued an arrest warrant, said Lieutenant General Pongpat Chayapan, of Thailand&apos;s police.", "Bout made no comment as he was paraded before the media at the Bangkok police headquarters."]}, {"article": "If Viktor Bout did not exist, a thriller writer would have invented him. A former Russian lieutenant, he became one of the world&apos;s biggest arms dealers, flying his ancient Soviet planes into battlefields from Liberia to Afghanistan. His clients have included the Taliban and the US government, African warlords and the UN.  He has as many aliases as an AK-47 has rounds, and has acquired the nicknames Merchant of Death and Lord of War. Pursued for years by the intelligence services of the world, and tracked for months by Thai detectives, yesterday the elusive 41-year-old was finally arrested in a five star hotel in Bangkok. This time Bout is accused of attempting to buy arms and explosives for leftwing Farc rebels in Colombia but the charge sheet could have listed half a dozen countries where governments might like to interview him. Accused of flouting UN arms embargos and wanted by Interpol, he was eventually arrested on a warrant issued by a Thai court acting on information from the US Drug Enforcement Administration. It is understood that DEA agents posed as arms buyers acting on behalf of Farc. &quot;We will take legal action against him here, before deporting him to face trial in another country, [most] likely the US,&quot; said Major General Pongpat Chayaphan, the commander of Thailand&apos;s crime suppression division. &quot;We have followed him for several months. He just came back to Thailand today.&quot;  Bout&apos;s story is a classic end-of-the-cold-war morality tale. As a smart and opportunistic 25-year-old, he took advantage of three converging factors after the collapse of the USSR: the sudden availability of cheap, clapped out Soviet airforce planes, a massive stockpile of weapons and spare parts guarded only by underpaid and disgruntled servicemen, and the burgeoning demand for arms from countless conflict areas around the world. Soon he was flying arms to any government or militia that wanted them and filling his Antonov cargo planes with less lethal wares, from gladioli to diamonds, for equally lucrative return trips. Initially, he provided cheap freight routes to whomever would pay, whether the Angolan government or Unita rebels, the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan or their Taliban opponents. After 2001, he worked for the US government and its civilian suppliers, shipping goods into Iraq on their behalf.  &quot;In an age when the US president has divided the world into those who are with the United States and those who are against it, Bout is both,&quot; wrote Douglas Farah and Stephen Braun, authors of Merchant of Death, the investigation into Bout which they published last year.  He has also flown peacekeepers for the UN to Somalia and aid to Sri Lanka, after the 2004 tsunami, and been accused of supplying the Liberian warlord, Charles Taylor. Yuri Orlov, the character played by Nicholas Cage in Lord of War, the 2005 film about the international arms trade, is said to be modelled on Bout. Amnesty International has commended the film for highlighting the baleful effects of the arms trade. Doubtless Bout will one day be the subject of a film himself, played perhaps by Russell Crowe in a bad moustache, dark glasses and baseball cap; Bout rarely allows himself to be photographed. As far as he was concerned, he was purely a businessman, providing an international freight service stripped of any ideology. As far as some aid agencies were concerned, on occasion Bout was the swiftest supplier of relief to disaster zones. As far as the then Foreign Office minister Peter Hain was concerned, when he denounced him in the House of Commons in 2000, he was a &quot;merchant of death&quot;, cynically fuelling the civil wars in Africa.  Yesterday Hain welcomed news that Bout had been detained in Bangkok. &quot;I am pleased he has been arrested,&quot; he said. &quot;At the time I exposed him, he was running arms to Angola, Sierra Leone and Congo and taking out blood diamonds. It was a lethal trade and some of those weapons were used against British troops in Sierra Leone. I tried with MI6 to dismantle his activities and we were partially successful but he still has a lot of friends in Moscow.&quot; Oliver Sprague, Amnesty International&apos;s UK arms programme director, also hailed the arrest. &quot;While we welcome the fact that Victor Bout has finally been arrested, why has it taken so long for this to happen?&quot; he asked. &quot;This is exactly why an international arms trade treaty is needed. Such a treaty would close loopholes that gun-runners like Viktor Bout so easily exploit for their own gain. Through their irresponsible arms transfers gun-runners like Bout have fuelled conflicts where dreadful human rights abuses have occurred.&quot;  Like any good fictional character, Bout has managed to muddy the waters of his past. He was supposedly born in Tajikistan but he has also claimed that he is from near the Caspian Sea in Turkmenistan. Others suggest he is Ukrainian. His many passports carry variations of his name, with his western nom de guerre being Victor Butt. He is married, with at least one daughter. Having studied at Moscow&apos;s military institute of foreign languages, he is multilingual, speaking everything from Uzbek to French, Portuguese to African dialects, but he denies that he was ever in the KGB.  &quot;Bout would fly for anyone who paid,&quot; an associate told the Centre for Public Integrity in the US, which has long tracked his activities. &quot;He is good because he takes the chances.&quot;  Although the US had made use of his services, the CIA targeted him and the US treasury froze his assets. Bout, with his companies registered in Liberia, fluttering countless flags of convenience, and with a lavish home in Moscow and powerful contacts around the world, continued undeterred.

The Conservatives would treble duty on alcopops, adding 54p to the \u00a32.50 price of a 275ml bottle of Bacardi Breezer, with higher taxes also imposed on beers such as Tennents Super and Carlsberg Special Brew. &quot;The tax-neutral package is also designed to be an alternative to the expected Budget decision to end the freeze on the duty on spirits,&quot; says the FT. According to the paper, Labour suggested a separate tax on alcopops would be contrary to European Union law, but the Tories have insisted they had been advised there was &quot;no problem&quot; with it. In its leader, the FT addresses taxation across the board as it looks ahead to the budget and makes a plea that less is more.

Writing in a style reminiscent of John Le Carr\u00e9 it says: &quot;He has as many aliases as an AK-47 has rounds, and has acquired the nicknames Merchant of Death and Lord of War,&quot; it says. &quot;Pursued for years by the intelligence services of the world, and tracked for months by Thai detectives, yesterday the elusive 41-year-old was finally arrested in a five star hotel in Bangkok&quot;. Bout was supposedly the inspiration for Nicholas Cage&apos;s character in Lord of War, the 2005 film about the international arms trade. The Russian&apos;s clients have included the Taliban, the US government, African warlords and the UN. &quot;He took advantage of three converging factors after the collapse of the USSR: the sudden availability of cheap, clapped out Soviet airforce planes, a massive stockpile of weapons and spare parts guarded only by underpaid and disgruntled servicemen, and the burgeoning demand for arms from countless conflict areas around the world,&quot; says the Guardian. His arrest also gets coverage on the front page of the International Herald Tribune. Bout was arrested on suspicion of attempting to buy arms and explosives for leftwing Farc rebels in Colombia. The paper notes: &quot;His arrest in Thailand came after a Colombian military raid into Ecuador on Saturday, during which the Colombian Army killed 24 guerrillas and obtained a computer laptop belonging to a senior FARC rebel commander.&quot; It says it was &quot;not immediately clear&quot; whether his arrest was linked to seizure of the laptop. * &apos;Lord of war&apos; arms trafficker arrested* IHT: Russian charged with trying to sell arms CLOSET IMPERIALISTS? Furniture store Ikea has been blamed for a lot of things in its time. Its huge stores have been criticised for blighting the landscape and causing traffic congestion. Its products have been criticised for being unimaginative and for contributing to uniformity in living rooms across the country. Plus, there is the issue of pieces missing when you get the flat-pack furniture home. But now there is a new charge on its rap sheet - &quot;Swedish imperialism&quot;. The Telegraph reports that academics in Denmark found the furniture chain was naming its cheaper products after Danish towns. &quot;The researchers claim to have discovered a pattern where more expensive items, such as beds and chairs, have been named after Swedish, Finnish and Norwegian towns whereas doormats, draught excluders and runners are named after Danish places,&quot; says the paper. Klaus Kj\u00f6ller, of the University of Copenhagen, apparently &quot;analysed&quot; (rather than browsed) the Ikea catalogue. He said it &quot;symbolically portrays Denmark as the doormat of Sweden, a country with a larger economy and population&quot;. An Ikea official described the product names as &quot;pure coincidence&quot;. Kj\u00f6ller did not reveal what his next piece of &quot;research&quot; is but perhaps he could take a look at that bastion of the British empire - the Argos catalogue. * Telegraph: Ikea&apos;s cheap lines upset the Danes COMING UP ON GUARDIAN.CO.UK TODAY &gt;&gt;&gt; Aftermath and analysis on the Israel school shootings. &gt;&gt;&gt; Terrorist instructor who called himself Osama bin London due for sentencing.", "publicationDate": "2008-03-07T03:05:18Z", "tags": [], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2008/mar/07/wrap.haroonsiddique", "title": "Gunman attacks Israeli school", "sentences": ["&quot;Pursued for years by the intelligence services of the world, and tracked for months by Thai detectives, yesterday the elusive 41-year-old was finally arrested in a five star hotel in Bangkok&quot;."]}, {"article": "The US has acted swiftly in its efforts to extradite the Russian businessman, Viktor Bout, from Thailand to stand trial on arms dealing charges.  Bout, nicknamed the &apos;merchant of death&apos;, was detained by Thai police in Bangkok earlier this week for allegedly offering to sell arms to the leftist Colombian guerilla group, FARC. Officials from the US attorney&apos;s office in new York and the drug enforcement administration (DEA) used seven of his alleged aliases as they outlined the charges against him. He was named as &quot;Boris,&quot; &quot;Victor Anatoliyevich Bout,&quot; &quot;Victor But,&quot; &quot;Viktor Budd,&quot; &quot;Viktor Butt,&quot; &quot;Viktor Bulakin,&quot; &quot;Vadim Markovich Aminov,&quot; along with his alleged associate, Andrew Smulian and accused of &quot;conspiring to sell millions of dollars worth of weapons to the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia \u2013 a designated foreign terrorist organisation based in Colombia.&quot;  It is alleged by the US authorities that between November 2007 and February 2008, Bout and Smulian agreed to sell to the FARC weapons, including surface-to-air missile systems and armour piercing rocket launchers. It would appear that two DEA contacts posed as FARC representatives.

The alleged cost was said to be $5 million (\u00a32.5m) to transport the weapons. The US authorities claim that Bout and Smulian conversed about the deal in coded language.

With Israeli F-16s roaming the skies above the city and military commanders growing increasingly desperate to find and kill high-value Hizbollah targets, the sighting should have been a watershed moment.  Those high-ranking Hizbollah officials, it is now widely believed, were, in all probability, meeting the man who apparently supplied them with their hi-tech weapons: Viktor Bout, the world&apos;s biggest arms dealer. It was, it appears, another close escape for the man known as the &apos;Merchant of Death&apos;, who had spent more than a decade fuelling wars across the world by being able to deliver weapons to anyone, anywhere, at almost any time. And that might not have been his greatest talent, for he also had shown an uncanny ability for avoiding arrest, despite having Interpol, the United Nations and half a dozen nations&apos; intelligence services tracking his empire of air cargo transports and weapons delivery services. Until last week that is - and his arrest by Thai authorities on suspicion of attempting to ship arms to American agents who were posing as Farc rebels in Colombia. The story of Viktor Bout has been an instructive modern parable of private enterprise and war and globalisation&apos;s bandit fringes. It is a story too that casts a bleak spotlight on the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, whose relationship with Bout was - at the very least - ambiguous. The Russians, it appears, protected Bout, even while he was being sought under an Interpol warrant, while individuals within the CIA (if not the organisation itself) appear to have been prepared to discourage other US agencies from going after Bout as long as he was useful. Far from being a shadowy figure, Bout, for all his elusiveness, was well known. The character of Yuri Orlov, played by Nicolas Cage in the film Lord of War in 2005, was based in large part on him. For now, however, the heavy-set former Soviet air force officer is languishing in a Thai jail and protesting that he visited Bangkok as an innocent tourist, even as the US is preparing a case for his extradition.  He will no doubt be ruing the fact that he was the victim of a classic sting - lured from hiding by the offer of supplying missiles to Farc by a paid informer of the Drug Enforcement Administration, which had been pursuing him for his links to the drugs trade, apparently acting independently of the CIA.  The pursuit of Bout alleged in the US indictment reads like a Robert Ludlum novel as the agency directed its informers through meetings from Copenhagen to Curacao and Bucharest in an elaborate charade that targeted at first a claimed Bout associate, Andrew Smulian, as the go-between for the fictitious deal. As the performance unravelled, Smulian slowly filled in the crucial details before spelling out Bout&apos;s name to one of the informers at a meeting in Copenhagen and identifying him as the man known as &apos;the merchant of death&apos;.  Through January and February Bout firmed up his end of the deal - for 100 Igla surface-to-air missiles and armour-piercing rocket launchers that would, according to the fictitious plan, be dropped by parachute by Bout&apos;s air crew at designated landing spots in Colombia. Bout was persuaded he was dealing with senior Farc leaders and, invited to Thailand by a man calling himself &apos;El Comandante&apos;, Bout broke cover. The trap was sprung.  Viktor Bout, arms dealer, was one of a kind. His rise was based not only on his ability to procure the kind of weapons his clients needed, but on running his business with the kind of reliability that would not seem out of place in a listed City firm.  Bout&apos;s emergence, experts recall, was sudden. One US official marvelled to Douglas Farah, an intelligence consultant and former journalist, who co-wrote the book Merchant of Death, published in 2007, about Bout&apos;s life and his many inexplicable escapes, that his arrival as a major arms broker was &apos;sort of like Jesus. He suddenly appears on the scene miraculously, as a full-blown character&apos;.  Known to hold numerous passports - most of which put his birth in 1967 - Bout&apos;s history prior to coming to the notice of the international community in the African and Afghan wars of the 1990s seems to be intentionally murky. In rare interviews Bout admits to having attended Moscow&apos;s prestigious Military Institute of Foreign Languages in the late 1980s, considered a training ground for military intelligence officers, and it is widely believed that he served as a translator in Africa for the Soviet air force.  It was with the collapse of the Soviet Union that Bout apparently saw his opportunity. Management of its vast stockpiles of small arms and other weapons were in a state of anarchy as unpaid officers and soldiers sold off whatever they could. Bout soon set up a series of small transport companies based in Belgium and the United Arab Emirates through a complex series of corporate structures that US officials have described as being modelled on drug cartels, designed to obscure ownership and operations.  At the core of these companies was a small number of huge Soviet transport aircraft that could negotiate poorly monitored developing world airspace and easily handle the rugged landing zones throughout Africa and Asia. This fleet eventually expanded to more than 60 and is called by many aviation experts the largest private fleet of Soviet-era planes in the world. Apparently speaking more than half a dozen languages, Bout was able to operate in the grey and black markets, shipping anything that needed to be moved for anyone, using the Emirates city of Sharjah as a major operations hub. While much of his early cargo was legitimate, including flowers, chickens - even UN peacekeepers - Bout is alleged by Interpol quickly to have built relationships with the suddenly unpaid and poorly monitored Russian army officers in control of the weapons stores and soon built a business delivering these weapons around the world.  His first markets were the wars in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola. Supplying the warlords of these conflicts would lead to a series of UN, American and European sanctions being imposed on Bout, beginning in 2002. He often equipped both sides of a conflict, most famously in Afghanistan, where he supplied both the Taliban and Ahmad Shah Massoud&apos;s Northern Alliance troops, often using the same flights to drop off weapons to the different combatants. Despite having his assets frozen, his headquarters operations in Belgium and United Arab Emirates exposed and his planes tracked by a diligent band of human rights groups, journalists and furious diplomats, Bout continued to operate with close to impunity until his arrest six years later. He managed it through an ever-morphing series of front companies that allegedly managed the fleet of Soviet-era transport planes. Among contracts to deliver men, equipment and weapons was one to deliver Fed-Ex parcels to Baghdad in 2004 on behalf of an American government that considered him a criminal. Bout delivered aid too - to both the south Asian tsunami victims in 2004 and Pakistani earthquake zone in 2005 - and shuffled UN peacekeepers and weapons into Darfur.  That Bout&apos;s life has been one of close calls is without question, but none it seems closer than the scrape in Lebanon in 2006. Anecdotal evidence supplied by Israeli and other intelligence sources claim that following the alleged sighting of Bout, GPS co-ordinates were passed from the Americans to the Israelis. And what is known is that on the sixth day of the war, in the early morning, nearly 20 guided bombs descended on a three-storey home inside the Bourj al-Barajneh refugee camp, a mile or so from Hizbollah&apos;s obliterated military headquarters.  Claims about Bout&apos;s links to Hizbollah are supported by reports seen by Douglas Farah. &apos;There were serious intelligence reports that Bout was in Beirut during the fighting between Hizbollah and Israel in the summer of 2006 and that he was the purveyor of much of the modern Russian armaments Hizbollah used to great effect in that conflict,&apos; Farah said last week. &apos;The Russian armour-piercing anti-tank weapons [that did so much damage to Israeli armour during the fighting] were of particular concern. Shortly before the conflict, Bout&apos;s Syrian-American partner had taken up residence in the Syrian capital Damascus, another suspected source of weapons for Hizbollah. The coincidence of his presence in Damascus and the flow of weapons to Hizbollah,&apos; said Farah, &apos;was not lost on many in the intelligence community.&apos; But while Bout&apos;s exploits as an arms dealer of choice to a host of unsavoury regimes and groups appears largely beyond dispute, what is more puzzling is how he got away with it for so long. The answer, according to many long-time Bout experts, intelligence officials and US government sources, is that there exists a strong circumstantial case that his ability to get into the world&apos;s most troubled regions and deliver exactly what he promised on time and at the promised cost made him an invaluable ally to more powerful interests than African warlords and diamond smugglers.  Alex Yearsley of the London-based Global Witness, the organisation that led the charge against both Bout and his partners for trading weapons throughout Africa, often in exchange for contracts for natural resources, believes his ability to evade arrest reflected not simply a lack of will by certain nations but a crass exercise in realpolitik. &apos;Due to the complicity of members of the [five permanent members on the United Nations] Security Council in the conflicts that Bout armed, on both sides, there were always politically expedient excuses not to arrest [him] earlier,&apos; he says. &apos;He ran an operation that always had plausible deniability. If his planes got caught delivering weapons to rebel movements or sanctioned regimes, they could always claim he was a rogue businessman. On several occasions when he was about to be arrested by one government another government would find a use for him.&apos; Bout&apos;s activities fell under increased scrutiny over the past five years, particularly after the revelations that he had been given contracts to serve the Iraqi occupation. UN travel sanctions and moves by the US Department of Treasury to freeze his assets and complicate his business operations limited his business, according to US government documents. But based in Moscow, Bout was able to continue operations until his arrest. Yearsley echoes many observers when he says it appeared he was under the protection of the Russian government. &apos;He seemed to have a very high level of protection in Russia, living there a happy and a free man despite Interpol &apos;red&apos; notices and Belgian arrest warrants. [This protection] makes a mockery of Russia&apos;s justice system. He was used by [Vladimir Putin] to wind up the Western liberals and make some Russian generals rich,&apos; he said. In a meeting last autumn, one European intelligence official who had worked on a long-running investigation into Bout&apos;s activities in Africa was openly cynical that he would ever be caught. &apos;Arrest Bout? Nobody wants to. Even my own government eventually shut us down. There&apos;s been a decision to hassle him with sanctions to keep him in line but everyone needs him at some point, or might [need him]. Plus he&apos;d just be replaced by someone else and they could be worse,&apos; the official said. &apos;As long as he stays quiet and remains useful, he can do this indefinitely.&apos;  In the end it was an agency of one of those states suspected of turning a blind eye to Bout&apos;s activities that was the engine behind his capture. According to a source with close ties to the DEA, the operation was so sensitive it was kept secret from other members of the US intelligence community, including high-ranking members of the Justice Department, precisely because of the fear that Bout might be tipped off by elements that the DEA agents feared had protected him in the past. A special unit was set up to run the operation due to &apos;war on drugs&apos; legislation and guidelines, allowed to operate outside the normal protocols that require US government-wide notification. Few people, even in the closed world of US intelligence, knew the DEA was tracking Bout, let alone setting him up for an arrest. &apos;[The DEA] was laughing at the CIA in their offices,&apos; because they had arrested someone that was perceived to be working for the agency, said one witness.  The strong suspicion that elements in US and other Western intelligence services supposed to be pursuing Bout were occasionally protecting him - no evidence suggests an official policy to protect Bout - is supported by an American diplomat who had tracked Bout as part of investigations into the trade in Russia&apos;s post-Cold War arms stockpiles. The diplomat described how efforts to track or harass Bout in the late 1990s and early 2000 by small-arms control experts at the State Department would eventually draw the ire of certain CIA officials, resulting in angry phone calls to the diplomat&apos;s superiors demanding that they back off. But the diplomat was emphatic that he did not believe the agency actively or officially worked alongside Bout, but rather traded information with him, making him a useful, if unappealing, occasional asset. &apos;I sense they were just as shocked as the rest of us when the bastard was found flying into Baghdad [on behalf of the US government],&apos; he said of the CIA. Farah, meanwhile, believes that Bout&apos;s willingness to work with Islamic organisations such as Hizbollah and the Islamic Courts in Somalia, considered an al-Qaeda ally by American officials, probably helped speed his demise. &apos;I think Bout was arrested now for several reasons: he was no longer useful to the United States and was an embarrassment ... he had shown a willingness to work with those directly opposed to US vital interests,&apos; Farah says. &apos;This, in the end, moved at least a portion of the US law enforcement and intelligence community to make him a high priority target, something he had not been for many years.&apos; The Arms Trade \u00b7 More than one trillion US dollars is spent each year on legal military expenditures and arms worldwide. \u00b7 In 2004, more than $30bn was spent in the international arms trade - excluding domestic sales within nations.  \u00b7 Many countries also have a substantial covert trade in weapons for use by their citizens.  \u00b7 Contracts to supply a nation&apos;s military are awarded by the government, making arms contracts of substantial political importance.", "publicationDate": "2008-03-09T00:02:37Z", "tags": ["Arms trade", "Thailand", "Colombia", "Russia", "US news", "World news", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Viktor Bout", "Europe", "Americas", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/09/armstrade.internationalcrime", "title": "Revealed: trap that lured the merchant of death", "sentences": ["For now, however, the heavy-set former Soviet air force officer is languishing in a Thai jail and protesting that he visited Bangkok as an innocent tourist, even as the US is preparing a case for his extradition."]}, {"article": "Fully inPhormed Up in arms is an understatement (Phorm fires privacy row for ISPs, March 6).

The Swiss maestro had suggested that Murray, who has now won two of their three meetings, was really no better than when they first played in Bangkok two years ago, and that his game was based on his opponents missing shots, rather than Murray hitting winners of his own. &quot;If he&apos;s said it got taken out of context, then I&apos;ll take him at his word,&quot; said Murray in Indian Wells. &quot;I know what it&apos;s like when you walk off the court from a match and the press comments come straight off the court.&quot; Well, the truth is that Federer&apos;s words were not taken out of context at all. He was asked what he thought about Murray&apos;s performance, and responded in a decidedly negative fashion. It then emerged, post Dubai, that Federer has apparently been suffering from mononucleosis, or glandular fever, since before Christmas, hence the &apos;reason&apos; for his less than perfect performance in Melbourne, where he lamely gave up his Australian Open title against Serbia&apos;s Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals, and then succumbed to Murray in the first round in Dubai. You may remember that Federer was unable to play in his usual warm-up event at Kooyong just prior to the Australian Open because of a stomach upset. Of course it is possible that the glandular fever, a debilitating illness that recently knocked Croatia&apos;s Mario Ancic out of competitive play for the best part of half a year, was not immediately diagnosed - for if Federer knew he had it, then surely he would not have played in Australia in the first place and, given the lingering nature of the illness, would have pulled out of the lucrative but meaningless exhibition against Pete Sampras last week in New York, prior to the two back-to-back Masters events in California and Florida? And why did Federer choose to reveal the nature of his illness only after he had lost to both Djokovic and Murray this year, and after he has apparently recovered? Murray and Djokovic might have grounds for feeling more than a little miffed that their victories, and the Serb&apos;s in particular, have been decidedly down-valued by Federer&apos;s revelation. It is all extremely curious. No matter whether he wins another slam or not, Federer has won his place in history as one of the all-time greats, and he may yet go on to claim the epithet of the best ever should he eventually beat Sampras&apos;s all-time record of 14 slams - and also win the French Open. But, for the moment, the halos of invincibility and all-around niceness have gone decidedly askew.", "publicationDate": "2008-03-13T15:27:05Z", "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport", "Roger Federer"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/mar/13/tennis.comment", "title": "Tennis: Steve Bierley on Roger Federer", "sentences": ["The Swiss maestro had suggested that Murray, who has now won two of their three meetings, was really no better than when they first played in Bangkok two years ago, and that his game was based on his opponents missing shots, rather than Murray hitting winners of his own."]}, {"article": "Saturday March 15 Strangers On A Train(Alfred Hitchcock, 1951)2pm, BBC2 A classic, black-hearted thriller, with Hitchcock&apos;s tongue wedged even more firmly in cheek than usual. The story has tennis player Guy (Farley Granger) meeting apparently sane Bruno (Robert Walker), who suggests a murder-swap: he will do away with Guy&apos;s troublesome wife, if Guy will reciprocate in the case of his father, the logic being that the police will never trace the killers. Some wonderfully wry scenes, including one of Hitch&apos;s nastiest murders, at the fairground. Never Say Never Again(Irvin Kershner, 1983)3.05pm, ITV1 Sean Connery returns as James Bond after a 12-year break. The film also goes back to the earlier, crunchier style, before the special effects ran riot. The Thunderball-ish plot has 007 tackling an impressively villainous trio - Max Von Sydow&apos;s Blofeld, Klaus Maria Brandauer&apos;s Max Largo (who has a penchant for playing a kind of GameBoy, with pain attached) and Barbara Carrera&apos;s voluptuous Fatima Blush. The Fifth Element(Luc Besson, 1997)9pm C4 This extraordinary sci-fi comedy imagines earth, 250 years hence, threatened by an ancient intergalactic menace. Red-headed mutant Milla Jovovich is a talismanic life essence; Gary Oldman is the evil Zorg, and Bruce Willis your heroic local flying-taxi driver; the director of the ineffably stylish Nikita and Leon creates a mesmerising futureworld. The Dukes Of Hazzard(Jay Chandrasekhar, 2005)9.30pm, ITV1 Fasten your seatbelts, you&apos;re in for a really bumpy ride: this rehash of the early-80s TV series is one big, dumb, crude movie, in which land-grabber Boss Hogg (Burt Reynolds) tries to swindle Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson) and his moonshine-peddling boys (Seann William Scott, Johnny Knoxville), amid lots of hot rod action. For the terminally nostalgic only. Below(David Twohy, 2002)11.40pm, BBC1 The US submarine Tiger Shark is in big trouble: hunted by German destroyers, damaged, leaky - and haunted. This last fact offers an extra element to the old claustrophobic wounded-sub drama, but in truth, the apparent ghost is only a ruse for a few cliched shocks and some creepy music. The Fabulous Baker Boys(Steve Kloves, 1989)11.55pm, BBC2 Jeff Bridges and brother Beau star as Jack and Frank Baker, siblings who once had grand piano ambitions, now playing the Seattle nightclub circuit. Into their weary world steps singer Susie Diamond (Michelle Pfeiffer), raising the tempo of their show and putting the forte back in Jack&apos;s love life. A sophisticated and engaging tale, in which the brothers&apos; embittered relationship is as compelling as the romance. The Fighting Temptations(Jonathan Lynn, 2003)3.40am, C4 The heart-sinkingly cliched plot has ruthless New York ad man Cuba Gooding Jr going back to his down-home Georgia roots and discovering his inner human by leading the Fighting Temptations chorus in the Gospel Explosion competition. A disposable story, then, but the music (from the likes of Beyonc\u00e9 and the the O&apos;Jays), makes up for it a bit. Sunday March 16 Jubal(Delmer Daves, 1956)1.30pm, BBC2 A mean and moody western with Glenn Ford (star of the original 3.10 To Yuma) as a wanderer getting tangled up in an Othello-for-cowboys tale of jealousy and violence, with Iago-like troublemaker Rod Steiger poisoning decent rancher Ernest Borgnine against his beautiful wife, Valerie French. It&apos;s a brutal, unforgiving drama played out against harsh landscapes. Absolute Power(Clint Eastwood, 1997)9pm, Five Taut, intelligent thriller told in the no-nonsense style of Eastwood&apos;s one-time mentor, Don Siegel. Clint is a veteran burglar who, by the usual fluke, witnesses US President Gene Hackman&apos;s implication in a woman&apos;s murder. The thief decides to take on the establishment, with increasingly unlikely results, but there are plenty of little gems. White Noise(Geoffrey Sax, 2004)10pm, C4 Grieving architect Michael Keaton discovers his recently deceased wife is trying to contact him through the TV&apos;s white noise static (it&apos;s known as Electronic Voice Phenomenon) - which sounds sweet, but there are more sinister forces at work. Stage Beauty(Richard Eyre, 2004)10.20pm, BBC1 Set in the London theatreland of the 1660s, this is, for a time, a spicy, bawdy costume comedy revolving around cross-gender actor Ned Kynaston (Billy Crudup) and his lovelorn dresser Maria (Claire Danes). But Jeffrey Hatcher&apos;s treatment of his own play gets bogged down in dour ruminations on sexual identity and what it means to be a bloke in a frock. Joe Kidd(John Sturges, 1972)11.15pm, Five Directed by the man who made The Magnificent Seven, written by Elmore Leonard and starring Clint Eastwood, who was riding high as the modern era&apos;s John Wayne, this ought to have been a top-gun western. But Sturges seems uncomfortable attempting a spaghetti western Hollywood style, and Leonard&apos;s script is a low-key affair, pitting Clint&apos;s hired gun against land-grabbing rancher Robert Duvall. Cat People(Paul Schrader, 1982)12.45am, BBC2 Gory but seductive remake of Jacques Tourneur&apos;s 1942 horror, with Nastassja Kinski as the sex-kitten who turns into a savage panther when aroused. Malcolm McDowell is her likewise afflicted, incestuous brother. The film lacks the claws of the old classic, but Kinski is a mesmerising act. Monday March 17 Alien 3(David Fincher, 1992)10.50pm, C4 Once more into those dark tunnels for Sigourney Weaver in this exceptionally gloomy chapter of the great SF horror saga. Her battle-weary Ripley crashlands on a planet colonised by convicts; her surrogate family are dead, but one creature is very much alive and stirring in her belly. Charles Dance, as the prison doctor, offers a little tender loving care, but that alien won&apos;t go away until she rises to the final challenge. The Big Boss(Lo Wei, 1972)11.05pm, Five Bruce Lee&apos;s first big feature, in which he kung-fu kicked his way to international fame. He&apos;s a gentle young fellow seeking work in a Bangkok ice factory, which he discovers is merely a front for big boss Han Ying Chieh&apos;s skulduggery. The trick is that Lee has promised Ma he won&apos;t fight, so spends part of the movie in a pent-up fury. And then ... Duets(Bruce Paltrow, 2000)12midnight, BBC1 A musical American odyssey that follows three mismatched couples as they head for a karaoke contest in Omaha, Nebraska. The most interesting pair are sneaky songster Huey Lewis, reuniting with his daughter, Gwyneth Paltrow. Tuesday March 18 Happy, Texas(Mark Illsley, 1999)11.45pm, BBC1 Hugely enjoyable little comedy, in which two escaped cons turn up in the Texas town of Happy obliged to pose as gay carnival directors organising a children&apos;s beauty pageant. The disguise soon cracks: &quot;He looked at her the way a hungry man looks at fried chicken,&quot; one local notes when Harry sets eyes on bank worker Jo (Ally Walker). Wednesday March 19 The Rock(Michael Bay, 1996)9pm, BBC1 Utterly implausible, corny, but still irresistible actioner: after all, it&apos;s got Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery and enough high explosives to make John Woo blanch. Mad-dog general Ed Harris has taken over Alcatraz, aiming missiles at San Francisco. To foil the plot Connery now has to break in, with FBI geek Cage for company. Thursday March 20 His Girl Friday (Howard Hawks, 1940)10.30am, BBC2 Rosalind Russell landed the role to die for - she&apos;s about to quit newshounding to marry steady insurance guy Ralph Bellamy, but her editor - and ex - Cary Grant has other plans. Charles Lederer&apos;s adaptation of the Hecht/MacArthur play is bursting with wit and gags, delivered at a furious, final-edition pace. Champion(Mark Robson, 1949)2.05am, C4 The Raging Bull of its time, a blistering account of brutal ambition in the boxing ring. It made a star of a beefy looking Kirk Douglas - his Midge Kelly, like De Niro&apos;s La Motta, sacrifices loved ones in his obsessive pursuit of money and fame in this belter of a movie. Friday March 21 The Magic Roundabout(Frank Passingham, 2005)12.55pm, BBC1 This computer-generated updating of the much-loved children&apos;s TV show is as kooky an adventure as any 1960s dopehead could ask for. It&apos;s a colourful tale with a marvellously eccentric collection of voices, including Tom Baker as evil sorcerer Zeebad. Freaky Friday(Mark Waters, 2003)2.35pm, BBC1 Enjoyable remake of the 1976 Disney comedy, with Lindsay Lohan as a teen whose hobbies are playing guitar in a rock band and winding up mum Jamie Lee Curtis. There&apos;s a body swap: daughter wakes up, shrieking, in the body of Mum, and vice-versa. Not exactly side-splitting, but an engaging comedy. Airplane!(Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, Jerry Zucker, 1980)5.30pm, Five Spoof disaster movie that has the crew of Flight 209 to Chicago struck down with food poisoning and jittery former fighter pilot Robert Hays taking the controls. A whirl of gags keep it cruising at 30,000ft on sky-high laughter, with old pros Leslie Nielsen and Lloyd Bridges in attendence. The Assassination Of Richard Nixon(Niels Mueller, 2004)10.30pm, BBC2 Sean Penn is at his hefty, sombre best as Sam Bicke, a modern American male who channels the pain of a failed marriage (to Naomi Watts, also excellent) and failing business into an attempt to assassinate the president. Based on real events in 1974, it&apos;s a fascinating portrait of a loser. Shampoo(Hal Ashby, 1975)12midnight, BBC2 Satirical tale of the working life and loves of a womanising Beverly Hills hairdresser. It&apos;s a farce of blow-dries and blow-jobs, except that star and producer Warren Beatty is more than just a pretty face, and the sexual adventures are part of a sly portrait of the smug and faddish late-60s US.", "publicationDate": "2008-03-15T00:19:16Z", "tags": ["Culture", "Television", "Television & radio"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/mar/15/features16.theguide1", "title": "The week's best films on TV", "sentences": ["He&apos;s a gentle young fellow seeking work in a Bangkok ice factory, which he discovers is merely a front for big boss Han Ying Chieh&apos;s skulduggery."]}, {"article": "We don&apos;t have room in print for all your letters and blog pingbacks, but do here online.

FUTURE PHORM Up in arms is an understatement,I have already been in touch with my MP about the proposed introduction of Phorm by my ISP. Will wait to see if he even knows what i am talking about. I will stop my contract with ISP and stop buying the GUARDIAN newspaper which has also signed up to Phorm. As a campaigning ethical newspaper (like free data) how could you use such a company with such an unethical background. Use your campaigning clout NOW to stop this happening. Anthony Coulson, Brixham As a matter of interest (being a shareholder) , surely the only people who will be complaining is the techy-savy IT guys? I use google, msn, yahoo and even though I know these companies store my search habits for a year - and here&apos;s Phorm WITh an opt out button (where does Google offer me the opt out?) anonymising my data, and the techy world is up in arms! Wayne Grossman, Shenely Thank you for letting me know that The Guardian has signed up to use the collected data from Phorm. Charles Arthur&apos;s article was very good, though it will be the last article I&apos;ll be reading from The Guardian. I&apos;ve removed the site from my favourites and won&apos;t be buying your paper anymore. Phorm is an extremely bad idea, being implemented by a very dubious company. Gareth (no post town given) Your article about Phorm in today&apos;s technology section was both interesting and worrying. Thank you for highlighting this potential abuse. Could you follow up with suggestions covering who in the ISPs you listed to contact to ensure that my web traffic is not tracked this way, and techniques for frustrating this activity if the ISP proceed regardless, such as client software to disable it, or use of proxies etc. Paul Dearing, London Thank you very much covering the Phorm issue currently being discussed on the internet. I found the article very useful, especially as I am one of the customers of the big three ISPs you have mentioned. Keep up the good work, Paul Taylor, Bristol &gt;&gt; The adult site operators, the pill merchants, the casinos: they will always be trying to advertise on this new service. Unless your life is completely clean, you could be in for a bad surprise when these adverts appear unexpectedly. A similar problem occurs with adverts that are permissible but only just. Are adverts for condoms permitted, for example? Arguably adverts for condoms are a public service because they encourage people to use protection \u2014 but you still don&apos;t want them to appear when you&apos;re showing someone an article from the Guardian. Why can&apos;t ISPs just do the job they are paid to do? theblog.org.uk &gt;&gt; I know that Google collects data on our search histories. I can at least rationalise that by thinking &quot;it is a free service that I don&apos;t have to use&quot;. But the ISPs are taking money for a service that they are changing without notice in ways that I don&apos;t want them to and which are ethically, if not legally, dodgy. There are those that argue that Britain is a heavily spied upon society anyway (the highest density of public surveillance cameras, for instance), but that doesn&apos;t mean that we should accept each new intrusion without some protest. auspiciousdragon.net/57north &gt;&gt; OK. Not happy. At all. Thanks, Virgin Fuckers. Currently researching methods to stop this... jboutandabout.livejournal.com THINK... NUCLEAR? Nuclear, at its very best industry guestimates, could only possibly save 4% of UK CO2 emissions and at the cost of research and development of energy efficiency and renewables. This, however, totally ignores any determination to effect energy related emissions from the demand side. Reducing demand directly, or by improving efficiency of energy use, has the potential to make very significant contributions to climate change targets. The other benefit of this aspect of energy policy, is that demand reduction and energy efficiency would financially benefit a vast number of individuals, whereas any nuclear program would only provide major real benefit to executives of energy companies and at great cost (for evermore) to the taxpayer. Charlie Graham, Green Party In his article, Charles Arthur advocates &quot;going totally nuclear&quot; because &quot;renewables - wind, wave, sun - cannot ever meet our growing electricity demand&quot;. However, tidal power can do this. In 1966, the Sustainable Development Commission reported to the government that there is no justification for a new nuclear programme because only four or five tidal power schemes can replace all of our nuclear power stations. It would be irresponsible to adopt nuclear power when there is not yet any suitable means of disposing of its radioactive waste and an alternative is available. Tidal power needs no new technology to be invented. The tidal barrage at La Rance in Frane has been generating for 40 years. A scheme for a Severn barrage was proposed 50 years ago and an updated scheme is under consideration by the government. If the government was seriously concerned about climate change, it would already be building the Severn Barage and starting to plan the next! John Flood, Solihull Hah. So you thought you&apos;d get away with it in Technology Guardian - that the assorted propellor-heads and anoraks wouldn&apos;t get disentangled in time to challenge your &apos;opinion&apos;? A room full of carbon dioxide is no more deadly than a room full of water - the result would be suffocation if you were left in there. The effect of a roomful of carbon dioxide on the climate would be truly negligible. I believe that you are incorrect when you say nuclear fuel is plentiful - the last figure I heard was 70 years supply at current rates of usage. And when that runs out what else is there? Yes, we are facing a crisis in that the byproducts of energy production pollute the environment, the answer is to consume less and the way to achieve that is for the human race to stop breeding at its present rate. You will be aware that the Government Scientist has realised what Malthus was telling us about 200 years ago - we&apos;re running out of stuff and lack of food will kill us quicker than climate change or radioactivity. Ken Grayling, Tharston An excellent article by Charles Arthur. Has anyone ever done a serious engineering investigation into whether it would be possible to provide enough electrical power from so-called &apos;renewables? Geof Davey, St.Albans At last someone sensible enough to point out that CO2 is just as &quot;deadly&quot; and &quot;toxic&quot; as nuclear waste (last week, Charles Arthur). But why stop there ? Surely wind turbines are equally life-threatening, if you climb up and get minced by the blades. And water can kill you if you drink too much AND if you drown in it, so tidal energy is actually twice as deadly as nuclear. In fact, drinking sea water can also send you mad - surely the only rational explanation for environmentalists&apos; blind opposition to a nuclear tomorrow. Simon Gulliver, Hove To suggest that if plastic bags cease to be used naphtha will be burnt as a waste product of oil refining is nonsense. Manufacture of plastic bags is only one of a wide range of outlets for polyethylene and polyethylene is only one of a large number of chemicals and plastics produced from naphtha; polypropylene, nylon, PVC,polystyrene, polyester fibre, synthetic rubbers are among familiar examples. In any case naphtha which is not used in chemical manufacture is put through a process (catalytic reforming) which transforms it into material suitable for use as a component of petrol. Peter Wiseman, High Peak Now I know Wikipedia is not necessarily the font of all knowledge but they list about a dozen uses of naphtha. This is also a claim made by the industry body, the Carrier Bag Consortium. Can you clear this up for us? Is there really no other use for naphtha? David (no post town given) Imagine the Romans had discovered a long-lasting poison which rendered parts of England uninhabitable even today. Now imagine a civilisation existed 10,000 years before the Romans, much more advanced than our own, leaving only traces today. But they used a mysterious and lethal technology which today means certain areas of the planet make you ill, but no-one understands why. That is the legacy we are leaving with nuclear waste. Charles Arthur says nuclear waste disposal has to be done &quot;for the long term&quot; but is &quot;well understood&quot;. Yes, we understand it, but I can assure you that in 10,000 years they won&apos;t. William Thomas, Dartington It is not necessary to cease manufacturing plastic bags as they do perform a useful role and, as you state, they use a material which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. Genuine plastic bags which are biodegradeable/compostable and meet both the EU and American requirements are available and thus be perfectly acceptable. Rob Golding, Plastic Free Farnham Campaign. I can give you half a dozen reasons why it would be wrong or downright nuts for Gordon Brown to announce a programe to source all our electricity from nuclear by 2020. They are well known, and if you want one reference, nearly all were raised in some form in the comments one the Government consultation on nuclear power (and duly ignored). But you are the journalist, paid to research and summarise this sort of thing, and you have good Guardian journalists (e.g. George Monbiot) to help screw your head on right, so why should I give you my time to do your job? So were you just flying a kite or too lazy to think it through? Either way, you insult your newspaper&apos;s readership - get thee to the Daily Mail, where as you rightly point out, half-brained ideas have a ready take-up among a half-brained readership and ditto politicians. (Now just imagine the DM had said &apos;Don&apos;t buy cars more than 140g/km CO2 and don&apos;t drive at more than 60 mph; really useful ideas which would have gone down like a lead balloon with its readership ....). However, &apos;no use for the naptha&apos; is also one of the least reasons I can think of to oppose the plastic bags initiative. Again, if you talk to the oil folk, I think you will find that they can either reform it to make lots of saleable things or at least burn it for their own energy needs. And most of us are quite capable of doing as the older ones always did in the past, taking a reusable bag shopping with us and thereby cutting out one piece of consumerist candy-floss which goes on the grocery bill one way or another. (But don&apos;t call it that in the DM - too near home!) Looking forward to some better journalism from you in the future. George Sudbury, Winchester &gt;&gt; The piece is quite well argued and I find it difficult to disagree with the author. But, I&apos;m staggered to see that it&apos;s in The Guardian, a bastion of the anti-nuclear lobby! It&apos;s a good job that it is not on CIF, there would be the most horrendous set of ranting posts building up already! junkk.blogspot.com MICROSOFT VS FLASH Glyn Moody ends his article about the Asus Eee and similar machines by saying &apos;It seems that the only way Microsoft can hope to get people using its software on this new class of low-cost, ultraportable machines is by going fully open source itself&apos;. The two people I know with an Asus have both foregone the Linux that came with it and installed Windows XP. John Stout, Ormskirk Glynn Moody spoils an otherwise interesting article by stating that you need 8GB to run Windows XP. WRONG. You can buy an Asus eee 4GB with Windows XP and the useful bits of Office pre-loaded in places like Bangkok. Cost about \u00a3200, and works perfectly. This and the other software including Foxit to read PDFs and an adequate antivirus programme (NOD32) take up about half the 4GB, leaving nearly 2 GB for files and folders. Add 4GB cards to the 3 USB 2.0 ports and SD slot (total cost less than \u00a340 from Amazon) and this effectively makes the eee an 18GB machine - more than enough for 95% of users. You can also easily add programmes via a USB CD ROM, and store your photos on an external hard drive at home. And with flash memory there&apos;s no tiny, spinning, hard disk to fail. I&apos;ll never buy a conventional laptop again. John Kanefsky, Morchard Bishop &gt;&gt; On a global basis FOSS is being openly adopted by Second and Third world economies for the very reason that they cannot afford First world solutions. Whole generations of children will grow up first learning Linux not WinXP thanks to the One Laptop Per Child laptop effort. So for Microsoft the world is going to become a dwindling world of opportunity. tightwadtechnica.com &gt;&gt; I played a little with an Asus Eee a few weeks ago. The keyboard is small and the screen isn&apos;t up to contemporary standards -- but I still like it -- a lot of bang for the buck. You can get this fully functional &quot;laptop&quot; for about $300. I&apos;m predicting that they&apos;ll gain a cult following similar to what happened with the Palms when they first came out. bradboydston.blogspot.com &gt;&gt; If I was in the marked for a commercial computer &quot;that just works&quot; I would go for the Apple of the ASUS because I cannot touch type on mini machines. But most of my machines are desktops, and half of my work is interacting with other systems. Vista is not OS X \u2014 the beautiful OS you can create things on. WIndows is now the basis of silos: medical databases, clinical trials tracking software\u2026 or is it? pukeko.net.nz &gt;&gt; Perhaps Microsoft can learn a lesson from history and Sun Microsystems. The lesson is not to wait. If Sun had open sourced Solaris and enabled its adoption on other architectures sooner it may have prevented the rise of Linux. Unfortunately for Microsoft it may be too little too late and the reality is that monopolies can&apos;t last forever. linux-foundation.org/weblogs/jzemlin TINYURLS (AT LENGTH) Last week&apos;s letters page rather mockingly featured a long url from BT, and that tinyurls might be preferable, subsequently supplied by Tech.Ed. Indeed the Tech section, such as in Ask Jack, makes a lot of use of tinyurls as it is. I would argue the opposite. A real url carries information of itself - tinyurls don&apos;t. It&apos;s much easier just to remember the basic URL and maybe the folder of a real URL, than the cryptic tinyurl. So, in the case of the BT, you just have to know that you go to products and services, and then to what&apos;s related to consumer products. I agree the BT site could be clearer, usually the easily remembered basic URL would do, so you can just click through from there. It would be nice if Ask Jack and other sections could give such basic URL information, perhaps to the first folder level, along with any tinyurls. Real URLs can also show what background company is involved, that the reader may be familiar with. Paul Bracciano, Belfast [This still misses the fundamental point: tinyurls are the most efficient use of space in print, which is where we use them, because they use only 18 characters - Tech.

We&apos;re all for a robust debate, but a number of Steve&apos;s assertions were factually incorrect. First, and for the record, BBC Worldwide has absolutely no access to licence-fee-payers&apos; cash and therefore cannot run any risk with it. We published our five-year strategy eight months ago in our Annual Review 06/07. It is a plan for growth largely from new businesses and was approved by the BBC Trust. But our established businesses are growing too, such as TV sales (profits 19% up year-on-year in 06/07) which secures great deals even on back-catalogue series - like the sale of &apos;Allo &apos;Allo to ProSieben in Germany, reported in newspapers on the same day as Steve&apos;s piece. We take passionate exception to the insinuation that the BBC&apos;s reputation might be at risk from BBC Worldwide&apos;s format and local production activities. Typically, the only example Steve cites, The History of Beijing, hasn&apos;t been made yet. The BBC&apos;s editorial values are as deeply entrenched in our teams as they are in any other part of the Corporation - our Mumbai production office is even led by a former head of BBC Religion and Ethics.  Steve also chose only to quote our direct programme investment figures over four years as &quot;evidence&quot; that returns to the BBC are not high enough. He omitted to quote the full picture we supplied him of total cashflow generated for the BBC, which increased from \u00a3141m in 03/04 to \u00a3225m in 06/07, a period in which we trebled our profits. It also ignores our investment in rights from others in the UK sector. And the value we bring to the BBC by exporting its brand internationally via the new channels and digital developments. Finally, he queries the returns on our production business in Los Angeles. Aside from the obvious point that having a production base there has allowed us to sell formats that previously we couldn&apos;t get off the ground, the 8% margin he quotes is - as we have continually told him - misleading as the format and production business currently carries the full overhead cost of the company&apos;s investment and indie liaison teams.

I notice that in your report on the banning of a hair advertisement for its use of Christian imagery, (Beauty ad banned after Christian outcry, MediaGuardian.co.uk, March 12), you have included a link to the video so, presumably, readers can view the video and make up their own minds whether or not it is offensive. If I recall, when you reported on the outcry about the Danish cartoons about the Prophet Muhammad, you did not publish the cartoons so readers could not make up their own minds on whether or not they were offensive. I would appreciate if you could explain the rationale of the website (and the Guardian newspaper) as to when allegedly offensive/banned materials will and will not be published.

The team were losing, the crowd was restless and the atmosphere was reminiscent of the bad old days when Stuart Pearce complained that this stadium had the acoustics of a library. But then something changed. Just before the hour, Stephen Ireland turned in City&apos;s first goal in 374 minutes of play and suddenly Eriksson&apos;s men were invigorated. The supporters rediscovered their voice and Nedum Onuoha rose superbly to head Elano&apos;s corner past Paul Robinson for the first goal of his City career. The game had been turned upside-down and the fans behind Joe Hart&apos;s goal turned to the directors&apos; box, where the former prime minister of Thailand was seated amid a posse of bodyguards wearing dark suits and 007 earpieces. &quot;Thaksin, Thaksin, give us a wave,&quot; they requested and this little man, with his unconvincing smile, rose to take the acclaim. Not the first time the thought occurred that it is a strange set of circumstances that brings the supporters of this proud old club to serenade a man who, among other alleged wrongdoings, is due to stand trial in Bangkok on multimillion-pound corruption charges. This was the first time he had attended a game since being arrested in Thailand but it was a very public show of support from the supporters and, on the back of a stirring comeback, his talks with Eriksson promise to be far more relaxed than if, as had looked likely at half-time, Tottenham Hotspur had completed a league double over City for the fourth successive season. Eriksson was certainly entitled to be happy because City had not won at home in the league since December 15 and, as he noted afterwards, the Premier League&apos;s statistics show there is only a 10% likelihood of winning a match after going a goal down. &quot;It shows that our spirit and morale is still there,&quot; he said. &quot;Plus it shows the players have not given up in terms of qualifying for Europe. We had taken only one point from our previous three games and if we had lost we would have been very far away. Now we are only far away. But today I am very pleased.&quot; Much of that undoubtedly stemmed from relief because, with the notable exception of a 2-1 win at Manchester United, it has been a difficult 2008 for Eriksson. His team have abandoned all hope of reaching the Champions League and are now eyeing the Intertoto Cup, and few would have backed them to defeat Juande Ramos&apos;s team once Vedran Corluka&apos;s mistake had allowed Tottenham to take the lead through Robbie Keane&apos;s 21st goal of the season. Eriksson took care not to criticise Corluka because, of all his foreign recruits, the Croatia international has arguably been the most impressive. That does not alter the fact, however, that Corluka was horribly to blame, completely misjudging an attempted interception to let Pascal Chimbonda amble forward, slide the ball into Keane&apos;s path and wait for his team-mate to do the rest. Keane duly obliged with a stylish left-foot finish, yet this was not a day the Tottenham captain will remember with fondness. Ramos had shown his ruthless side at half-time by replacing Aaron Lennon with Tom Huddlestone and when he curtailed Keane&apos;s afternoon in the 67th minute it provoked a fit of pique. Keane had been one of Tottenham&apos;s brighter players and this was the seventh time in the last eight games he had been substituted. His response was to gesture angrily before stomping past Ramos and throwing a training top to the floor. &quot;I didn&apos;t see that,&quot; Ramos said. &quot;But it&apos;s normal. Players want to play and they&apos;re disappointed when they are brought off. But it&apos;s a squad game. We have a big squad and from time to time we need to rest players who have had a lot of minutes.&quot; He said all this with barely a flicker of concern on his face but his expression darkened when he was asked to analyse Tottenham&apos;s second-half performance. A gruelling Uefa Cup tie against PSV Eindhoven, with extra-time and penalties, undoubtedly contributed, but he also detected signs of complacency. &quot;We were so much in command,&quot; he said of the first 45 minutes. &quot;Maybe our players thought the game was won before it was.&quot; His complaints extended to the match officials, and understandably so because Ireland was marginally offside when he turned in Elano&apos;s knockdown for the equaliser. The mistake was exacerbated late on when, from a free-kick, the flag was raised against Dimitar Berbatov, who seemed inactive as Onuoha, under pressure from Darren Bent, inadvertently turned the ball into his own net. &quot;It should have been 2-1 to us,&quot; said Ramos. But by that stage Thaksin and his associates were toasting a win that stops the rot at City.", "publicationDate": "2008-03-17T22:08:28Z", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Manchester City", "Tottenham Hotspur"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/mar/17/sport.sport1", "title": "Man City 2-1 Tottenham", "sentences": ["Not the first time the thought occurred that it is a strange set of circumstances that brings the supporters of this proud old club to serenade a man who, among other alleged wrongdoings, is due to stand trial in Bangkok on multimillion-pound corruption charges."]}, {"article": "Simply thrilling ... Anthony Minghella&apos;s Madam Butterfly at the Coliseum. Photograph: Tristram Kenton Twenty years ago, I was asked by the publisher Nick Hern to write an introduction to a collection of Anthony Minghella&apos;s stage plays. Minghella was already a well-known playwright and director, attached to the Royal Court and the Tricycle theatre, and he had served as a script editor on Grange Hill. Ahead lay the early episodes of Inspector Morse and his screen breakthrough with Truly, Madly, Deeply (1991). Minghella was never classifiable in the 1980s. He was not &quot;political&quot; or fashionable but he was always interesting, experimental and palpably in touch with his feminine side; I think that all came from his Anglo-Italian background. In his first play, Whale Music (1980), his heroine took time out from university to have a baby, and we see the repercussions on her landlady, her old English teacher and a disaffected teenage lesbian. Minghella&apos;s family were ice-cream traders on the Isle of Wight. Family life - and life cycles - by the sea are a constant theme in his early work, especially two companion plays of 1984, A Little Like Drowning at the Hampstead theatre and Love Bites at the Derby Playhouse. The first was set on a grey English beach and reanimated the jealousy of a wronged woman while an adulterous, opera-loving paterfamilias (hilariously played by Alfred Molina) took over the play; the second charted sibling rivalry in the ice-cream and catering trade, offering a theatrical paradigm of the Rossi or Forte dynastic stories. When the producer Michael Codron presented Minghella&apos;s last stage play, Made in Bangkok, at the Aldwych theatre in 1986, it famously lost its entire capital investment of \u00a3250,000, despite having Felicity Kendal in the cast and Michael Blakemore directing. The piece never received its critical due, yet anticipated the growth in sexual tourism and cultural anomie in the bars and massage parlours of an unreal environment with wit and vivacity. I loved Minghella&apos;s spirit of adventure and &quot;stickability&quot; and greatly admired his dedication to his profession and his generosity towards others. His production of Madam Butterfly for the ENO was simply thrilling. It revealed a showman side to him I had not expected from that early stage work, although he did indulge &quot;theatrical instinct&quot; in Two Planks and a Passion (1983), in which the court of Richard II escapes from London to York where the guilds prepared their mystery plays for the feast of Corpus Christi. Anthony always seemed to be relaxed, and his face was creased in a permanent, pleasant smile. There was nothing phoney about him. I loved the idea that his office was just around the corner from where I live in Gospel Oak. I was supposed to be dropping in for a cup of coffee one day soon.", "publicationDate": "2008-03-18T16:15:53Z", "tags": ["Stage"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2008/mar/18/rememberingminghella", "title": "Remembering Minghella", "sentences": ["When the producer Michael Codron presented Minghella&apos;s last stage play, Made in Bangkok, at the Aldwych theatre in 1986, it famously lost its entire capital investment of \u00a3250,000, despite having Felicity Kendal in the cast and Michael Blakemore directing."]}, {"article": "Anthony Minghella, who has died in hospital after a haemorrhage following an operation aged 54, made an impact in various fields \u2013 as director of theatre, television, cinema, radio and opera \u2013 as well as being a playwright, screenwriter, producer and chairman of the BFI.  The talented Minghella&apos;s eclectic oeuvre stretched from a short film of the three character Play (2000), as part of Channel 4&apos;s Samuel Beckett cycle, to the $83m (\u00a341.5m) Hollywood epic, Cold Mountain (2003); from the intimate fantasy, Truly Madly Deeply (1990), made for the BBC, to the vast panorama of the Oscar-winning The English Patient (1996), financed by Miramax.  Minghella, whose ample figure and cheery countenance exuded a love of life, seemed to be Harold Pinter, Orson Welles, David Lean and Richard Attenborough all rolled into one.  A passionate supporter of Portsmouth football club, he was also a mixture of English restraint and Italian exuberance. Some critics stressed the adjectives in the titles of The English Patient and Cold Mountain to describe his work, while others saw his films as truly, deeply romantic. His background might explain this dichotomy.  Minghella was born on the Isle of Wight, the son of ice-cream factory owners. His father was Italian/Scottish and his mother came from Leeds. But, according to Minghella: &quot;My maternal grandmother was a real figurehead in my life. She was a tiny peasant woman from Valvori, near Monte Cassino, in the south of Italy\u2026 She&apos;d run a cafe in the Gorbals in Glasgow so she spoke this coarse Italian/Scottish. I&apos;d listen to her talk in a very superstitious, Catholic way about men and women and how the world worked: men are weak, women are strong; women survive, men are helpless and stupid.&quot; It was she who influenced his play, A Little Like Drowning (1989), a moving and funny drama about an Italian grandmother and her English grandchildren.  Before going to university, Minghella had dreams of being a pop musician, and played keyboards in a couple of bands - Earthlight and Dancer. &quot;That was a really important part of my life. There was a rich music scene on the island at the time and for me writing songs developed later into writing plays. Music was a very vibrant ingredient in my life, and I originally saw my early plays as being a format for music,&quot; he explained.  Minghella graduated from the University of Hull, where he eventually abandoned his doctoral thesis on Beckett. &quot;There was a time, for five years, when I read Beckett almost on a daily basis. The sense of language and poetry in his writing has been the single biggest influence on me as a writer,&quot; he declared, which may come as a surprise to those who know only his blockbusters at the literary end of the middlebrow.   During the 1980s, after lecturing in drama at his alma mater, he worked in television, mainly writing scripts for Grange Hill, Jim Henson&apos;s puppet series, The Storyteller: Greek Myths and Inspector Morse. At the same time, he was writing plays, winning the London Theatre Critics Award for most promising playwright in 1984, and for best play for Made in Bangkok in 1986, an examination of the exploitation of women in Thailand by westerners. Minghella&apos;s international breakthrough came with Truly Madly Deeply, which he wrote and directed, about a bereaved woman (Juliet Stevenson) who literally wills her dead lover (Alan Rickman) back to life. This rather sentimental drama, a very English riposte to the Demi Moore vehicle, Ghost, was transcended by sincere performances and some telling dialogue. Perhaps the lure of Hollywood was so strong that Minghella accepted to direct a fluffy romantic comedy, Mr Wonderful (1993), for which, exceptionally, he did not write the screenplay.  He did not make the same mistake with The English Patient for which he sequestered himself for 18 months away from friends and family while writing the adaptation of Michael Ondaatje&apos;s 1992 Booker Prize-winning novel. This was followed by two years filming in Tunisia and Italy.   The result, a considerable leap in scale and ambition for Minghella, was an impressive, if somewhat languorous, epic love story set during the second world war, which won nine Academy awards, including best director and best picture. Certainly Minghella showed that he was able to get fine performances from his cast and control a complex structure \u2013 the plot moves between the Italian front near the end of the war, where a French-Canadian nurse (Juliette Binoche) cares for a seriously-burned patient (Ralph Fiennes), and north Africa during the late 1930s, when the patient, revealed as a Hungarian count and mapmaker, fell in love with a married woman (Kristin Scott Thomas).  The Talented Mr Ripley (1999), the second film to be based on the novel by Patricia Highsmith, was a sleek and intelligent thriller with Matt Damon in the title role. Cold Mountain, based on Charles Frazier&apos;s sombre bestselling American civil war novel, another meticulously crafted picture in the epic mode, was stunningly shot (in Romania) by cinematographer John Seale. Starring Jude Law and Nicole Kidman \u2013 he as a wounded confederate soldier who makes the decision to desert his army at the end of the war to return home to his love - it was reminiscent of the lush historical pictures of yesteryear. Comic relief was provided by Renee Zellweger, as a hillbilly, a role that won her the Best Supporting Actress Oscar.  Returning to England, and his first original screenplay since Truly Madly Deeply, Minghella was literally more at home with Breaking and Entering (2006), starring Jude Law as an architect involved in the gentrification of Kings Cross. Pleasant but rather pat, the film made little impression.   Minghella&apos;s last completed film, The No 1 Ladies Detective Agency, written with Richard Curtis, is to be shown on BBC 1 this Easter Monday. It has already caused controversy, unrelated to the subject or quality of the film, because it gives a rosy picture of Botswana, where it was filmed and where hundreds of Bushmen have been relocated from their ancestral lands.   In 2005, Minghella, who was given a CBE in 2001, also courted controversy with his party political broadcast on behalf of the Labour party which showed Tony Blair and Gordon Brown working together lovingly. In the same year, Minghella directed Madame Butterfly, of which the Guardian&apos;s Tom Service wrote: &quot;Anyone expecting images of cinematic brilliance from Anthony Minghella&apos;s new production of Puccini&apos;s Madam Butterfly for English National Opera will not be disappointed&quot;, although the critic went on to express mixed feelings about the production, which went on to the Metropolitan in New York, where it met with success.  Minghella is survived by his wife, Hong Kong-born choreographer Carolyn Choa, a son and a daughter.  Robert Cooper writes: I read Anthony before I met him. It was his stage play, Two Planks and a Passion,&quot; which I was hoping to direct for the radio in the mid-1980s. The play was about members of one of the smaller guilds in 14th century York who were rehearsing The Passion as their contribution to the city&apos;s Miracle Plays during a time of cutbacks in the local council&apos;s arts budget.  Then news gets out that the king is coming and suddenly the dull burghers of York are hurling money at their humble plays in an orgy of self-aggrandisement. It was an extraordinary combination of razor-sharp observation of human frailty coupled with characters of genuine sincerity, complexity, warmth and charm.  Meeting Anthony was the same experience. A quiet wit, an extraordinary insight into people and situations, a massive intelligence which he never used to make you feel inadequate, and most of all a relaxed presence that made you feel that somehow, you &quot;belonged&quot;. And as you got to know him you found his genuine delight in the simple treats of life \u2013 food, friendship, conversation, music and especially family.  Watching him direct his first film was a revelation. It was Truly Madly Deeply in Bristol in 1989. As soon as Anthony began, I realised he had somehow discovered how you direct \u2013 he had not tried to learn everyone&apos;s job \u2013 he just treated people in a way that ensured they did the best work they had ever done in their life for him. It was as simple as that. And of course it was as hard as that. The pressures of film-making reveal can character in a very unforgiving way \u2013 but no matter how difficult the situation, I never saw Anthony anything other than intensely interested in and understanding of other people&apos;s artistic process. Nor was this apparent only on set \u2013 after working with the cast and crew for 12 hours, he would meet with them half an hour later to watch rushes, have dinner with them and round the evening off with a game of squash with the assistant designer - cheered on by those who had not by this time given up and gone to bed. With Anthony you simply couldn&apos;t not do your best for him. He is an immeasurable loss to the culture of this country. \u0095 Anthony Minghella, playwright and film director; born January 6 1954; died March 18 2008", "publicationDate": "2008-03-18T19:27:44Z", "tags": ["UK news", "Film", "Theatre", "Culture", "Stage", "Anthony Minghella"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/mar/18/filmnews.theatrenews", "title": "Obituary: Anthony Minghella", "sentences": ["At the same time, he was writing plays, winning the London Theatre Critics Award for most promising playwright in 1984, and for best play for Made in Bangkok in 1986, an examination of the exploitation of women in Thailand by westerners."]}, {"article": "Anthony Minghella, who has died aged 54 in hospital after a haemorrhage following an operation, made an impact in various fields - as a director of theatre, television, cinema, radio and opera, as a playwright, screenwriter and producer, and as chairman of the BFI.

This was followed by two years filming in Tunisia and Italy. The result, a considerable leap in scale and ambition for Minghella, was an impressive, if somewhat languorous, epic love story set during the second world war, which won nine Academy awards, including best director and best picture. Certainly Minghella showed he was able to get fine performances from his cast and control a complex structure - the plot moves between the Italian front near the end of the war, where a French-Canadian nurse (Juliette Binoche) cares for a seriously burned patient (Ralph Fiennes), and North Africa during the late 1930s, when the patient, revealed as a Hungarian count and mapmaker, fell in love with a married woman (Kristin Scott Thomas). The Talented Mr Ripley (1999), the second film to be based on the novel by Patricia Highsmith, was a sleek and intelligent thriller with Matt Damon in the title role. Cold Mountain, based on Charles Frazier&apos;s sombre bestselling American civil war novel, was another meticulously crafted picture in the epic mode, stunningly shot (in Romania) by cinematographer John Seale. Starring Jude Law and Nicole Kidman - he as a wounded Confederate soldier who decides to desert his army at the end of the war to return home to his love - it was reminiscent of the lush historical pictures of yesteryear. Comic relief was provided by Renee Zellweger, as a hillbilly, a role that won her the best supporting actress Oscar. Returning to England and his first original screenplay since Truly Madly Deeply, Minghella was literally more at home with Breaking and Entering (2006), starring Jude Law as an architect involved in the gentrification of King&apos;s Cross. Pleasant but rather pat, the film made little impression. Minghella&apos;s last completed film, The No1 Ladies Detective Agency, written with Richard Curtis, is to be shown on BBC1 next Monday. It has already caused controversy - unrelated to the subject or quality of the film - because it gives a rosy picture of Botswana, where it was filmed, but where hundreds of bushmen have been relocated from their ancestral lands. In 2005, Minghella, who was made a CBE in 2001, also courted controversy with his party political broadcast on behalf of the Labour party which showed Tony Blair and Gordon Brown working together lovingly. In the same year, Minghella directed Madam Butterfly, of which the Guardian&apos;s Tom Service wrote: &quot;Anyone expecting images of cinematic brilliance from Anthony Minghella&apos;s new production of Puccini&apos;s Madam Butterfly for English National Opera will not be disappointed,&quot; although the critic went on to express mixed feelings about the production, which went on to the Metropolitan in New York, where it met with success. Minghella is survived by his wife, Hong Kong-born choreographer Carolyn Choa, a son and a daughter. Robert Cooper writes: I read Anthony before I met him. It was his stage play Two Planks and a Passion which I was hoping to direct for the radio in the mid-80s. The play was about members of one of the smaller guilds in 14th-century York who were rehearsing The Passion as their contribution to the city&apos;s Miracle Plays during a time of cutbacks in the local council&apos;s arts budget. Then news gets out that the king is coming and suddenly the dull burghers of York are hurling money at their humble plays in an orgy of self-aggrandisement. It was an extraordinary combination of razor-sharp observation of human frailty coupled with characters of genuine sincerity, complexity, warmth and charm. Meeting Anthony was the same experience. He possessed a quiet wit, an extraordinary insight into people and situations, a massive intelligence - which he never used to make you feel inadequate - and, most of all, a relaxed presence which made you feel that, somehow, you &quot;belonged&quot;. And as you got to know him you found his genuine delight in the simple treats of life - food, friendship, conversation, music and especially family. Watching him direct his first film was a revelation. It was Truly Madly Deeply in Bristol in 1989. As soon as Anthony began, I realised he had somehow discovered how you direct. He had not tried to learn everyone&apos;s job, he just treated people in a way that ensured they did the best work they had ever done in their life for him. And of course it was as hard as that. The pressures of film-making can reveal character in a very unforgiving way. But no matter how difficult the situation, I never saw Anthony anything other than intensely interested in and understanding of other people&apos;s artistic process. Nor was this only apparent on set. After working with the cast and crew for 12 hours, he would meet with them half an hour later to watch rushes, have dinner with them and round the evening off with a game of squash with the assistant designer - cheered on by those who had not by this time given up and gone to bed. With Anthony you simply couldn&apos;t not do your best for him. His death marks an immeasurable loss to Britain&apos;s cultural life. \u00b7 Anthony Minghella, playwright and film director, born January 6 1954; died March 18 2008 \u00b7  This article was amended on Wednesday March 26 2008.

Thaksin is due to stand trial next month on corruption charges in Bangkok and if, as he confidently expects, he is cleared, the former Thai prime minister is optimistic about recouping the \u00a3800m worth of assets that have been frozen by the courts. Until then, however, he has made it clear that Eriksson will have to work on a restricted budget. While there will still be the kind of money available that will make City the envy of most Premier League clubs, Thaksin has found his first year in English football &quot;heavy on the pockets&quot; after spending \u00a356m on 11 new players and it is unlikely, therefore, that Eriksson will have the backing to take on the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea in the transfer market - at least for the time being. The strategy outlined by Thaksin is that, if Eriksson brings in three or four more accomplished signings during the summer, City should be in a position to qualify for the Uefa Cup next season. If everything goes according to plan, he has then promised to back Eriksson with greater funds to help them achieve his goal of reaching the Champions League for the start of the 2010-11 season. &quot;First year, top 10; second year, top six; and third year, Champions League. That is the strategy,&quot; said Thaksin. &quot;We are eighth now so there is not much pressure to reach the top six but reaching the top four is a lot of pressure. There will not be huge amounts spent this summer but maybe the following summer.&quot; That will be of concern to Eriksson who, referring to his transfer outlay thus far, confessed yesterday that he had wanted &quot;the same again&quot;. Eriksson added: &quot;I don&apos;t know if that is going to be the case but, to be among the top six, we need to take good players. The competition between the top eight, nine, 10 teams will be even more difficult next season.

Invite the wealthiest and most loyal guests from around the world, feed them a 10-course dinner cooked by three French Michelin-starred chefs and give them a luxurious place to lay their heads for the night, all on the house.  Then whisk them off to the slums of Kolkata or Bangkok&apos;s backstreets, so the 50 high-rollers could witness life on the other side of the tracks and perhaps put their hand in their pocket. But the luxury Bangkok hotel, lebua at State Tower, hit a snag with the event it coined &quot;emotional tourism&quot;. It got more emotion than it bargained for when the French media saw it as a poverty tour for the rich, triggering a mighty furore. Within days the trio of elite French chefs withdrew. Alain Soliveres of the Michelin two-star Taillevent in Paris, Jean-Michel Lorain of the three-star La C\u00f4te Saint Jacques in Burgundy, and Michel Trama from the three-star Les Loges de L&apos;Aubergade in south-west France, all made their excuses. Suddenly the menu of their signature dishes was in jeopardy. Soliveres was to make risotto with Brittany lobster and a Roquefort ice cream for dessert. &quot;You can&apos;t see people living in misery and then go back to Bangkok to eat foie gras and truffles,&quot; said Soliveres. &quot;It started an enormous, enormous scandal in France. I had no choice but to boycott the meal.&quot; Lorain called the event &quot;unhealthy and morally unjustifiable&quot; in an email to lebua executives.  But worse was to come. The controversy gave other Michelin-starred chefs cold feet and two dozen around the world turned down the opportunity, the offer of free flights to Bangkok and \u00a34,000 for a night&apos;s work not enough to entice them. Fortunately the 50 diners will not go hungry. Last night lebua&apos;s chief executive officer, Deepak Ohri, said he had managed to sign up new Michelin pedigree chefs, two boasting two stars and two with one star. He declined to name them for fear of reigniting the controversy, only saying they were European. Menus will now be rewritten for the event in April and the poverty tour has been scaled back to just a trip to the &quot;elephant village&quot; of Surin in Thailand&apos;s north-east, where rice farmers struggle to survive. The free dinner and tour for the most loyal lebua customers that will cost the hotel \u00a3150,000 is a far cry from its effort of last year when it charged for a &quot;million baht meal&quot; (\u00a315,800) cooked by Michelin-starred chefs to raise money for charity. None of the European, American and Asian guests - bankers, executives and casino owners - have backed out. A Dutch publisher of luxury travel guides, Nick Zirkzee, has already pledged 5% of the profits of a new book to people of Surin. &quot;There are poor areas in the world that everybody is aware of,&quot; Ohri said. &quot;We want to help a corner of the world where most people haven&apos;t been.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-03-21T00:04:19Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/21/thailand", "title": "Chefs lose taste for gala as Thai fundraising tour turns sour", "sentences": ["Then whisk them off to the slums of Kolkata or Bangkok&apos;s backstreets, so the 50 high-rollers could witness life on the other side of the tracks and perhaps put their hand in their pocket.", "But the luxury Bangkok hotel, lebua at State Tower, hit a snag with the event it coined &quot;emotional tourism&quot;.", "&quot;You can&apos;t see people living in misery and then go back to Bangkok to eat foie gras and truffles,&quot; said Soliveres.", "The controversy gave other Michelin-starred chefs cold feet and two dozen around the world turned down the opportunity, the offer of free flights to Bangkok and \u00a34,000 for a night&apos;s work not enough to entice them."]}, {"article": " Down on the farm Wales This summer, single-parent family specialist Mango Kids is offering a trip to the Brecon Beacons, staying on a working farm in a cluster of two- to four-bedroom self-catering cottages (converted from former stables, dairy and granary).

Long in our calendars, the premiere screening of The No 1 Ladies&apos; Detective Agency at London&apos;s BFI Southbank on Tuesday was an event all of Anthony Minghella&apos;s friends, colleagues and admirers eagerly awaited. I&apos;d flown in from Los Angeles, and was looking forward to seeing the film, which I&apos;d worked on as a production executive. But even more than that, I was looking forward to spending some time with Anthony that evening, to see that wonderful, beaming smile and to feel the warmth of being part of the extraordinary extended family he created around him. And then, around Tuesday lunchtime, the emails and calls started flooding in. Someone had heard a strange rumour; another friend had heard something bizarre on the radio; in the end, too many voices to ignore. My fiancee called from Mexico, where she&apos;s travelling. Even 7,000 miles away, the news had broken immediately. &apos;Have you heard? I can&apos;t believe it. Anthony died.&apos; Like every single person who had the luck and great good fortune to encounter this wonderful, funny, charming, endlessly generous man, it was impossible for either of us to absorb. Six months earlier, we&apos;d been on set with him in Botswana where, with huge joy, energy and commitment, he was bringing to life Alexander McCall Smith&apos;s beautiful character, Precious Ramotswe. As Richard Curtis (his long-time friend and collaborator on the screenplay) reminded us at the premiere, more than one person remarked on the similarities between Anthony and Precious: their insatiable curiosity, their genuine interest in everyone around them, their ability to solve problems, their wisdom and insights into the mysteries of the human personality - and above all, just their sheer compassion and love. Anthony - or as he was to all of us lucky to be near and dear to him, just simply &apos;Ant&apos; - had the rare gift of making everyone who came into his orbit feel special. That applied to the person changing the sheets at the Gabarone Sun Hotel just as much as it applied to a long-standing collaborator such as Harvey Weinstein, who loved and admired Anthony and financed so much of his work. It was through Harvey, as a production executive at first Miramax and then the Weinstein Company, that I came to work regularly with Anthony for nearly 10 years. But I&apos;d met Ant many years before, when he was a young playwright and television writer looking to break into films, and I was running the government fund that put up money for script development. The younger, thinner, hairier fellow he was in those days made an instant impression on me because of his passion for the project he was pitching (clearly not quite enough of an impression, though, for as he never ceased to tease me, we turned down his proposed adaptation of the novel Pascali&apos;s Island Our paths crossed many times over the coming years, not least whenever I found myself organising a screenwriters&apos; training course such as the Performing Arts Lab in England, or Scrawl in South Africa. Always ridiculously generous with his time, he would find a way to shoehorn into his absurdly packed schedule of work a few hours, and in some cases a few days, to sit with writers just embarking on their careers, and share real wisdom and knowledge. But he was never prescriptive about work. Never one for preaching writing &apos;formulas&apos;, his favourite metaphor came from something he saw when travelling with his beloved wife Carolyn. Once, in China, they saw a street artist working seemingly randomly on a picture. &apos;What are you doing?&apos; asked Anthony. &apos;Taking a line for a walk,&apos; the artist replied. And for Ant, that was the greatest piece of advice he could ever give a writer: don&apos;t tie yourself to a totally mapped out route - allow the work to breathe and find its own inner life. It was something he applied very much to his own work. Famous for adapting novels such as The English Patient, The Talented Mr Ripley and Cold Mountain, his methodology was always the same - read the novel several times, then put it aside and never refer to it again once he started the screenplay - a wonderful approach that meant that the films, at least for me, never became the dreaded &apos;faithful literary adaptation&apos;. After Cold Mountain, he started talking about writing an original screenplay, something he had wanted to do for a number of years - but some terrific novel or other had always seduced him away at the last moment. The resulting film, Breaking and Entering, had a very mixed reception, but with the hindsight that it is his last work for the cinema, it&apos;s a fascinating summary of Anthony&apos;s lifelong interests and passions: the clash of people from different classes and cultures, the need to find ways to communicate, but above all, and perhaps most unfashionably, the idea that there is nothing more important in the world than love. A man I would describe as a realistic romantic, Anthony was not afraid of seeing the dark side of the world - but ultimately, he always believed there was hope and light. As he embarked on writing the script, he told me he was tired of seeing films about couples breaking up, meeting new people and going off into the sunset together at the end of the story. He wanted to make a film about a troubled marriage where the couple don&apos;t separate at the end; a love story about the difficulties of a long-term relationship - and what it takes to hold a marriage together, rather than take the easy solution of leaving. Tough and tender, Breaking and Entering was not to everyone&apos;s taste - but for those who appreciate an adult drama with complex, truthful, flawed characters, it continues to resonate. It seems fitting that the funny, touching and completely unique world conjured up by Alexander McCall Smith in his No 1 Ladies&apos; novels should be Anthony&apos;s final legacy to us. Precious&apos;s world is one that Anthony loved: a world that, for all its occasional darkness, is essentially a place where good people ultimately flourish, and a strong and compassionate woman like Mma Ramotswe can help others - and indeed herself - triumph and overcome their fears, doubts and uncertainties. There&apos;s no sense of tying things up in an overly neat bow at the resolution, but there&apos;s a wonderful sense of peace and joy and all - or very nearly all - being right with the world. And the fact that his wife Carolyn, daughter Hannah and son Max requested that the premiere go ahead as planned, so that we could, in fact, celebrate Ant&apos;s life and work, just seemed absolutely right. A very sad evening in so many ways, but one filled with laughter and joy, too. When I was asked to write this piece, I was still in a state of shock at losing such a wonderful friend, and I will confess that much of this was typed through tears, sorrow and a sense of disbelief. But sitting down to think back on the days I had with Anthony - whether he was engaged in furious and intense debate in LA with his long-time production partner, Sydney Pollack (with whom he enjoyed a classic &apos;odd couple&apos; kind of relationship), producing a movie in Toronto, directing a scene in London, lecturing on a screenwriting course in Cape Town, enveloped by his family in a cocoon of love and affection, or just being the most amazing listener and consigliore over dinner or drinks at his favourite club, 2 Brydges Place - has made me even more grateful for the time I was privileged to spend with him. It seems like only weeks, rather than months ago that my fiancee Pauline and I were on set with Ant in Botswana. He&apos;d already charmed her off her feet in a typical way - by his amazing gift of being genuinely interested in the person to whom he was talking, discovering within minutes where exactly she was from, even what football club she supported. We&apos;d just got engaged, and after Ant hugged both of us, in a typically lovely, slightly off-the wall way, he kissed her engagement ring. &apos;Anthony Minghella kissed my ring!&apos; she told all her friends later, with a huge smile that told everyone it was worth more to her than a papal blessing. Which of course it was, because it came from one of the most genuinely beautiful people you could have ever hoped to meet. The man who held our hands: Tributes from his friends and colleagues Patrick Marber: Playwright/actor I first met Anthony when he took me out to lunch many years ago. It wasn&apos;t that long after The English Patient and I was very excited and nervous to meet this incredible writer-director who had moved me so deeply with his film. We talked for hours. He made you want to talk. He was completely alive to the present moment. He focused on you and the conversation you were having, never took a call, never made you feel like it was a professional meeting. He didn&apos;t just treat you like an equal, he actually believed you were one. With his great friend Sydney Pollack he&apos;d formed a production company called Mirage. He asked me if I&apos;d write something for them to produce and naturally I said I&apos;d be delighted. But I never got round to it. Or he was busy or I was. And so on. Years later, last year in fact, I wrote a short film called Love You More. The director Sam Taylor-Wood took it to Anthony who agreed with typical enthusiasm to produce it. I hung around the Mirage offices a fair bit in 2007. It was a really fun place to be, full of energised, young optimists, all of them mentored by him. The last time I saw Anthony was at a production meeting a few months ago. He was hard at work on his own film (with all the stress that entails) but he never complained, just ran the meeting, beaming with pleasure at the younger talent assembled for the project. The meeting broke up and I began moaning about the broadcaster&apos;s refusal to give us the extra five grand I felt we needed for the budget. Anthony pondered this a moment, smiled charmingly and said with certainty: &apos;Let&apos;s just use what we have and make a good film. We&apos;ll be alright.&apos; And we were. We were always all right with him. Sam Taylor-Wood: Artist/director My phone rings, my hand reaches out and a soft strong voice says hello. It&apos;s Anthony Minghella. From that point on my life shifted into a new realm. He told me he had read a heart-breaking book (Julie Myerson&apos;s The Story of You) that made him think of my work, and that if I felt the same after reading it, he would love to produce that film and for me to direct. Come on, he said, it&apos;s time you made a film. Let me hold your hand and we&apos;ll do it. With those big hands he clasped mine and off we went. He then called a few days later asking what I thought, had I read it yet, come on let&apos;s do it. Oh, and would I be on the board of the British Film Institute with him? Yes, I said with much more trepidation, do I have to? Yes, you do, we need people like you. It&apos;ll be fun, I&apos;ll be there. At the first meeting I sat in the chair where my place name was, next to his. I was introduced and welcomed then he held my hand on and off throughout the four-hour meeting. I&apos;d learned that this was his manner, not a flirtation. He held everyone&apos;s hand. I sent him a text one day and he called me back noting that with his big fingers texting was near impossible. We laughed. We made a short film, Love You More, written by Patrick Marber; throughout the shoot I didn&apos;t see him once. You don&apos;t need me, he said. You know what to do. When he told me he was going into hospital I held his hand. We talked about fear; we pushed it aside. The day before he died he sent me a text saying all was good, would I go see him in a couple of days? I hold his hand tighter. Joe Wright: Director We heard about Anthony as we arrived on set for the day&apos;s shooting. Seamus McGarvey, who is my cinematographer here and was also on Atonement, was Anthony&apos;s director of photography on No 1 Ladies Detective Agency out in Botswana and he had received a call very early on. Naturally, we were all devastated. I got up and made a little speech and said we were going to dedicate the day&apos;s filming to Anthony. We were filming with the entire Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra so it was a very fitting scene. About 700 of us were thinking of him in that beautiful Frank Gehry concert hall, and they were playing Beethoven&apos;s Ninth Symphony, the third movement. Anthony was a godfather to a whole generation of film-makers, and during the development of the Atonement screenplay I spent a number of evenings with him and he&apos;d just ask me really annoying, needling questions. He&apos;d grill me on each choice I was making - it was a masterclass in storytelling, really. All the bits where I thought, &apos;Oh I&apos;ll just get away with that,&apos; well he&apos;d pull me up on them and quiz me. He made me consider very carefully everything I was doing. He&apos;d make me articulate the choices I was making in the script and clarify them. He had tremendous generosity of spirit but, although he got paid a few bob for it, what he actually did was way beyond the call of duty. It was an education for me. The industry is a more frightening place without him as a guide - he seemed to know what he was doing and he had this ease to his work; it wasn&apos;t an angst-ridden thing for him and that attitude has taught me a lot. When I was casting the interview scene at the climax of Atonement, I initially wanted a real journalist or a famous interviewer, such as Melvyn Bragg. But I didn&apos;t want a &apos;day player&apos; because the focus had to be on Vanessa Redgrave that day: we didn&apos;t want anyone taking up emotional space with their nerves on the day of shooting. It was my fiancee Rosamund Pike who had the idea of getting Anthony, and he just came along and was relaxed and everyone trusted him, even though he hadn&apos;t really acted before. He allowed Vanessa the room to do what she did so well. Her performance is tribute to his generosity. Philip French: Observer film critic Anthony Minghella was one of our greatest filmmakers. When I first met him he looked like an elderly art student. Later, shorn of his beard, his disappearing hair cut to the skull, he came to resemble a cheerfully confident Buddhist monk. Our first meeting was in Cannes in 1992, at a lunch given by Sam Goldwyn Jr for the out-of-competition screening of Minghella&apos;s second movie, Mr Wonderful, a charming, lightweight romantic comedy set in New York&apos;s blue-collar Italian-American milieu, which he understood well from his own background in Britain. I had admired his broadcasting writing, especially a BBC radio play called Cigarettes and Chocolate, in which Juliet Stevenson had appeared (as she did in his first movie Truly Madly Deeply), and thought his Made in Bangkok, an attack on the exploitation of the third world by European tourists, one of the best things to appear in the West End during the Eighties. On a personal level, I was immediately struck by his charm, modesty and gifts as a conversationalist. At that time I thought him a talented miniaturist, part of the tradition David Lean had been criticising in a controversial speech at Cannes a few years before, when he took British film-makers to task for parochialism and lack of large-scale vision. When in 1996 I saw The English Patient, I realised Minghella was now carrying the torch for ambitious, visionary cinema that had once been upheld by Michael Powell and Lean. The English Patient is his Lawrence of Arabia, Cold Mountain his Dr Zhivago, films of grandeur, powerfully intelligent and epic in conception. In the way they linked art house and multiplex they also brought Stanley Kubrick to mind. Yet he was able with the ambitiously conceived but more modest Breaking and Entering to approach the contemporary British scene he had put aside. And he could take on smaller project s such as the TV version of The No 1 Ladies&apos; Detective Agency being screened tonight on BBC1. In his work Minghella pursued complex themes of exile, journeys home, cultural reconciliation and the search for roots, and he was notable for his support and encouragement of others. A man of immense energy and enthusiasm, he was devoted to the arts and public service and was one of the best chairmen the BFI has ever had, guiding it through a crucial period. At the time of his death he was skilfully juggling numerous exciting projects. He will be greatly missed.

His stadium appearance was evidence of the extraordinary resilience of a man thrown out of power in 2006 in a military coup, Thailand&apos;s first non-constitutional change of government for 15 years. But Thaksin is back - and Thailand may be about to suffer the consequences.  Late last month he returned to Bangkok for the first time since the army evicted him. &quot;I don&apos;t want to get involved in politics,&quot; he said soon after arriving, which as political claims go is at the unconvincing end of unbelievable. He faces a series of corruption charges, which he dismisses as politically motivated. In the meantime, he has been strengthening his power base. A recent army reshuffle saw officers involved in the coup sidelined.  The perpetual sadness of Thai politics is that the country has come close to stability and sustained democracy, but always fallen short. Thailand is not the first country to suffer political strain from rapid economic development, but Thaksin has made the situation acute. The military coup that removed him was the result of political failure, not a cause of it, a response to a form of capitalist autocracy. The coup was initially popular, at least in Bangkok where the urban middle-class took a dim view of billionaire personality politics. Nor was it opposed by the king. But the army proved unable to find an electable alternative and suffered as a result in a general election last Christmas.  The trouble for Thaksin&apos;s critics is that he remains more popular than they do. Although his former party, Thai Rak Thai, was not allowed to take part in the election, its successor, the People&apos;s Power party, was - and it won. Thaksin handpicked its leader, Samak Sundaravej, an ageing rightwing politician and sometime TV chef. His government is now struggling to improve Thailand&apos;s rate of economic growth.  Another coup is unlikely. But if Thailand is to sustain effective democracy, Thaksin&apos;s opponents need to come to terms with the reasons for his popularity - not just his wealth and past control of much of the media (although these helped) but his courting of the rural poor in central and northern Thailand, who have gained almost nothing from the boom that has turned Bangkok into a playground for the global elite. Thaksin offered cheap medical care to those who could not afford private charges. That does not make him a democrat, or the right leader for his country. But if he and his kind are not to take more and more power, as the king&apos;s health weakens, Thailand must strengthen its democracy, and not fall into conflict and coups.", "publicationDate": "2008-03-24T00:02:16Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/24/thailand", "title": "Leader: The trouble with Thaksin", "sentences": ["Late last month he returned to Bangkok for the first time since the army evicted him.", "The coup was initially popular, at least in Bangkok where the urban middle-class took a dim view of billionaire personality politics.", "But if Thailand is to sustain effective democracy, Thaksin&apos;s opponents need to come to terms with the reasons for his popularity - not just his wealth and past control of much of the media (although these helped) but his courting of the rural poor in central and northern Thailand, who have gained almost nothing from the boom that has turned Bangkok into a playground for the global elite."]}, {"article": "&quot;Australia&apos;s first WiMAX operator, Hervey Bay&apos;s Buzz Broadband, has closed its network, with the CEO labeling the technology as a &apos;disaster&apos; that &apos;failed miserably&apos;,&quot; reports CommsDay.  In an astonishing tirade to an international WiMAX conference audience in Bangkok yesterday afternoon, CEO Garth Freeman slammed the technology, saying its non-line of sight performance was &quot;non-existent&quot; beyond just 2 kilometres from the base station, indoor performance decayed at just 400m and that latency rates reached as high as 1000 milliseconds.

But now two of the world&apos;s most luxurious hotels are caught up in an unseemly brawl over the alleged poaching of staff. The general manager of Bangkok&apos;s 132-year-old Oriental hotel, Kurt Wachtveitl, swapped the splendour of his usual surroundings for the less salubrious atmosphere of a Bangkok criminal court on Monday, accused by Thailand&apos;s attorney general of libelling the owners of the newcomer, Lebua at State Tower.

Let&apos;s drink to that! Champagne? Don&apos;t mind if I do.  &quot;Blair Force One&quot; is grounded. Sarko and Carla may have flown into London in Le Presidential Jet Fran\u00e7ais, but Hair Shirt Gordon thinks a prime minister&apos;s plane is a waste of money and a vulgar status symbol, it would seem. (Personally, I don&apos;t mind vulgar status symbols so long as someone else is paying.)  But for those of us who regularly travel abroad with the PM, the &quot;continuation of existing arrangements with UK airlines&quot;, as the aviation minister and former leftie firefighter Jim Fitzpatrick put it in his statement to MPs, suits most of us in the lobby just fine.  When Margaret Thatcher was PM and Bernard Ingham was her press secretary - harrumphing, snorting, banging the table with his fist and going purple in the face as we mercilessly wound him up \u2013 we used to fly on those ancient RAF VC10s which apparently had been carrying the prime minister around since Harold Wilson&apos;s day.  They were noisy and slow. It was also claimed \u2013 and never denied \u2013 that Maggie used to order the pilot to slow down to save fuel to keep the cost down. See, a prime minister ahead of her time, back in the days when we thought a carbon footprint was when you got coal dust on the sole of your shoe.  The catering and the wine list on board were extremely limited and served by big butch RAF types with short-cropped hair. And occasionally by men.  But when John Major started chartering big BA jumbos for long-haul trips \u2026 ah, bliss. Champagne all the way from ever-attentive trolley dollies. Lots of fawning, like you get in the restaurants of SW1 when the waiters know it&apos;s all being picked up on the company credit card.  Relations between lobby correspondents and female members of the flight crew have always been cordial, to say the least. Phone numbers exchanged, invitations to lunch in the press gallery dining room and that sort of thing. (Gosh, we lobby correspondents know how to give a girl a good time: a visit to PMQs, a few glasses of Chateau Refreshment Department at lunch, the afternoon in Strangers&apos; Bar and then off to the Sports and Social Club. Wonder why they never want to come to the Commons a second time?)  With the PM, you invariably travel business or club class, too. Well, we didn&apos;t come into the lobby to turn right when we board an aeroplane, did we?  But flying with the PM on a charter has another big advantage for lobby correspondents: air miles, provided you&apos;re flying on a route that the airline operates commercially, as I understand it. These days, most of us have clocked up enough air miles flying with the PM to make Michael &quot;sub judice&quot; Martin jealous.  Marvellous. A perk to compete with those enjoyed by MPs! Well, we didn&apos;t come into the lobby to pay for the flights to our own summer holidays, did we?  In between eating, drinking and the dreary briefings from the prime minister&apos;s spokesman, you can even watch a film on board. Who can forget the occasion when John Sergeant, in his ITN days, told Alastair Campbell to tell Tony Blair not to come down the plane and talk to us until the film he was watching had finished, triggering a fierce argument, as I recall, with his former BBC colleague and rival Robin Oakley. It made the diary columns the next day, of course.  I recall a few flights to the US on a chartered Concorde with the PM, one with John Major and one with Tony Blair, as I remember. (Well, we certainly didn&apos;t come into the lobby to pay for Concorde with our own money.)  The advantage of Concorde was that, unlike in a jumbo jet, the PM and his inner circle weren&apos;t separated from the lobby up in first class, because it was all first class, and there was nothing Alastair could do to prevent us wandering up to the front of the plane to talk to Tony, Cherie and the team.  Inevitably, long-haul flights, when you&apos;re looked after by an always-obliging crew, present a challenge to the thirstier lobby members. And yes, the lobby has on more than one occasion drunk the plane dry of Champagne on a long flight home from the far east. Particularly when the Sunday lobby (the political correspondents/editors from the Sunday papers) are on board. Funny, that.  I recall Mrs Blanko once turning out in the company Mondeo at the VIP Suite at Heathrow to collect yours truly and a few colleagues after a particularly long flight back from Tokyo, Bangkok or somewhere like that. I&apos;m afraid she was rather appalled (not shocked, obviously, but still appalled) at the state we were in as we fell off the plane. Strangely, she has never offered to come to pick me up since.  The flight back from Iraq is always a particularly thirst-quenching trip. That&apos;s because you fly from Kuwait, which is dry. So by the time the lobby boards the aircraft to fly home from a trip to Baghdad or Basra, most of us are gagging for a gargle.  The bill for the lobby on tour gets sent by the Cabinet Office straight to Red Top Towers or Broadsheet Boulevard, which is as it should be. We didn&apos;t come into the lobby to settle our own bills. As Fireman Jim said &quot;a continuation of existing arrangements \u2026 provides the best solution&quot;.  Indeed it does, Jim. Cheers!

For months, staff working at Heathrow were invited into small conference rooms at the airport decked out like mini-cinemas, where they were encouraged to view films and 3D computer-generated images of the future of air travel that would be Terminal 5. As they were handed popcorn, they were given mock boarding cards asking: &apos;Are you up for it?&apos; Those employees working in security and baggage handling who confirmed that they were indeed &apos;up for it&apos; were invited to apply for jobs that came with a raft of new working practices which unions viewed with suspicion.  Both BA - the airline that has sole use of T5 - and BAA, the airport&apos;s operator, saw the move as a chance to create a new workforce, one where the staff of both companies would be working for the &apos;greater good&apos;.  Of T5, BAA chairman Sir Nigel Rudd boasted: &apos;It is, by any standard, a triumph of ambition, commitment and collaboration. It will breathe new life into Heathrow and put us back at the leading edge of global travel.&apos; Further down the BAA management food chain there was similar enthusiasm. Veronica Kumar, the 29-year-old impressively named &apos;head of people and change&apos; at T5, purred that the move offered a &apos;nirvana&apos; of sorts. &apos;Our policy has been to create a context for change, then to apply changes within that context.  If few people outside the world of human resources knew what Kumar was on about, they were clearer about her ultimate goal. &apos;We want to give fliers an experience they&apos;ll remember,&apos; she said. Last Thursday Kumar achieved her aim, although not for the reasons BA and BAA would have wished. As the queues stretched, IT systems crashed, baggage went missing, scuffles broke out and children screamed, it was clear the launch of T5 had been an unmitigated disaster - rivalled in recent times only by the opening night of the Dome, when hundreds of VIPs, including most national newspaper editors, were forced to queue in the cold on the last night of the millennium. But T5 should never have been a failure. It had, after all, been 40 years in the planning. It was a \u00a34.3bn project boasting an IT system that could make Nasa envious, all encased beneath a gleaming concrete and glass structure designed by the Richard Rogers partnership. The new terminal contained outlets run by Harrods, Prada, Bulgari, Gordon Ramsay and Paul Smith. It was nothing less than a statement about Britain&apos;s place in modernity; a confident signal to the world. The Queen had gone as far as to declare T5 a &apos;highly impressive, 21st-century gateway to Britain and the wider world&apos; when she opened the terminal to much fanfare a fortnight ago. T5&apos;s problems on its first day immediately sparked a national debate. Could Britain get any major project right? On the plus side, there was the new terminal at St Pancras, delivered early and under budget. On the downside there was the collapse of Railtrack and MG Rover; the NHS&apos;s problem-strewn IT system; continuing concerns about the efficacy of the ID cards programme; the failure of the Child Support Agency; missing data; and the burgeoning Olympics bill. But for both BA and BAA, whose brands have been heavily tarnished in recent years by increasingly splenetic claims of poor service from customers, the new terminal offered a fresh start. The companies talked hubristically about how their intelligent baggage system - 11 miles of conveyor belts controlled by an integrated network of 140 computer servers able to process 12,000 bags an hour - could cut waiting times between touchdown and baggage reclaim to just 15 minutes.  &apos;Terminal 5 has been constructed around the baggage system,&apos; a BAA spokesman said, while showing The Observer around the site shortly before it opened. &apos;We believe it to be the most advanced baggage system in the world.&apos; Concerns that the system, built on the back of 400,000 man-hours of software engineering, would not be ready were quickly dismissed by both companies. They pointed out that 15,000 volunteers had taken part in tests that mirrored the actual experience right down to the use of actual baggage. True, the system had crashed for an entire day when it had been road-tested in Terminal Four last year, causing scores of flights to be delayed, but the technical glitches had been ironed out, it was said.  And perhaps they had. Except for the fact that everyone involved had overlooked one problem: the workforce. Systems analysts talk about the Kalashnikov theory. &apos;We speak all the time about people, processes and technology, but people are steadily being eliminated from the equation and a large organisation can&apos;t do away with them altogether,&apos; said Dr Simon Moores, a veteran IT expert who advises the likes of Microsoft and the Conservative party. &apos;Hence solutions should be like the Kalashnikov rifle: modular. You can buy an AK47 that has a Chinese receiver, a Czech barrel and a Russian frame in an African bazaar and it still won&apos;t jam because all the parts fit together.&apos; In the case of T5, it seems BA and BAA were blinded by the glorious promises offered by their new baggage delivery system and failed to pay sufficient attention to one key component: the staff it had initially charmed with popcorn and epic declarations of a new beginning.  &apos;Airports are complex,&apos; said Paul Smith, aviation group secretary with the Public and Commercial Services Union that represents immigration staff at Heathrow. &apos;There are lots of different components involved performing lots of different functions. If one part fails, then things will deteriorate into chaos.&apos;  There were problems even before the first plane taxied into T5 from Paris shortly after 4am. Staff turning up for work could not park their cars. Then they struggled to find transfers into the terminal. Once inside, a chronic shortage of security staff meant baggage personnel had to wait in increasingly long queues to be vetted. Some became so frustrated they started using the fast check-in for business passengers. &apos;Instead of a smooth flow of personnel into the cargo areas, it was a drip feed,&apos; said one person familiar with the situation.  As Thursday morning progressed and more passengers arrived, the failure to get personnel into place on time in the cargo areas became manifest. Baggage backed up on the conveyor-belt system. Those staff who made it through security then had to log into a computer system to find out where they would be working, but many were unclear how to work the system.  &apos;There was a lack of familiarity with the cargo areas,&apos; another source said. &apos;People were having difficulty finding out where they were supposed to go.&apos; The baggage backlog continued to build. One person familiar with the system likened it to a sponge: &apos;It could take so much water and then no more.&apos; With too few baggage handlers in place, the system became sclerotic, forcing long delays and then cancellations. Inside the terminal, there were scenes of chaos. Along with angry passengers, staff were becoming increasingly demoralised. Security staff coming to their desks in arrivals were alarmed to find large orange signs warning them: &apos;Danger, Live Cables.&apos; It turned out the cables were no longer live, but no one had remembered to remove the signs. As the day wore on, drinking water was shipped in for the overstretched baggage teams, but the security staff refused to allow the bottles in. By the end of Thursday, no fewer than 68 flights had been grounded and many passengers were in the uncomfortable position of being forced to fly without their luggage as 5,000 bags lay stacked up on the underground conveyor belt system. The next day a further 36 incoming and a similar number of outgoing flights were cancelled and the queues continued to stretch. Yesterday, 66 more flights did not take off and BA said it thought a further 37 would be cancelled today. With BAA adopting a siege mentality, BA&apos;s chief executive Willie Walsh took it upon himself to make an apology in front of the cameras on Friday. &apos;It had,&apos; he said with the sort of understatement unlikely to endear him to the angry hordes, &apos;not been BA&apos;s finest hour.&apos; The airline that once boasted of being &apos;the world&apos;s favourite&apos; was forced to pull a multimillion-pound advertising campaign promoting its new baby. To cap it all, the lifts went down. &apos;There are 16 lifts and only one is working - how can you have an international airport like that?,&apos; asked one passenger information advisor. &apos;If I were to blame anyone, I would blame BAA - they are in charge of the lifts, trolleys and phones. The airport does look beautiful but it looks a bit like Asda when they are in the middle of restocking.&apos; For those working inside the terminal, the chaos had been predictable and therefore preventable. For months in the run up to the terminal opening, unions had been privately requesting talks with BA and BAA managers to establish contingency plans and define working practices. But Smith said managers were deaf to their concerns. &apos;There was an unwillingness to engage with us,&apos; he said. Part of the problem was the scale of the operation. T5, the size of Hyde Park, was not just a new terminal, it was practically doubling the size of Heathrow. &apos;Although they had operated a practice system, they were never going to know whether it would work properly until the day,&apos; said Smith. Yesterday, although BA had promised delays would be reduced to only 30 to 40 minutes, an outraged passenger, Patti Conroy, 58, from Seattle, was told her flight to Paris had been put back by eight hours. &apos;When we first got here we were told that the flight wasn&apos;t cancelled, then we were told it was,&apos; she said. &apos;When we looked online it still claimed it wasn&apos;t cancelled. We&apos;ve spent a whole day in here when we could have been in Paris having fun. I&apos;ll just go home if it&apos;s cancelled again. I thought they would have sorted the bugs out by now, given that the first day was such a disaster; we are into the third day now.&apos; John McDonnell has been the Labour MP representing Heathrow for more than 30 years and has seen numerous planning inquiries, management changes and staff reorganisation at the world&apos;s busiest airport. He said many Heathrow workers, past and present, had visited his weekend surgeries to express concerns about T5. &apos;In the run-up to the opening, a lot of people took redundancy or voluntary retirement,&apos; he said. &apos;So a lot of experienced people went in the restructuring while the number of middle management increased. That&apos;s the basis on which T5 was launched.&apos; Questions are also being asked about the role played by BAA&apos;s owner, the Spanish construction company Ferrovial which paid \u00a310.3bn two years ago to acquire several UK airports, including Heathrow. Ferrovial has total debts of \u00a322.6bn, which is costing it more than \u00a31bn a year to service in interest payments - half its profits. Given its restricted room for manoeuvre, there are concerns, denied by the company, that it is attempting to cut costs at the expense of customer service. &apos;They&apos;ve bitten off more than they can chew,&apos; McDonnell said. &apos;They&apos;ve been looking at the bottom line and not examined what&apos;s going on in terms of management.&apos; But BA&apos;s Walsh said he was not going to point the finger. &apos;There were a number of problems. There was not a single event. Some of the errors were ours, some were BAA&apos;s.&apos;  Others will. Not only has the chaos damaged Britain&apos;s standing in the world, it has also raised uncomfortable questions about London&apos;s preparedness for the Olympics and the delivery of other large infrastructure projects, such as Crossrail. In the aftermath of last week&apos;s ignominious headlines, the Conservatives called for an inquiry into the &apos;chaos and confusion&apos;, while the British Chambers of Commerce described T5 as a &apos;PR disaster for London and the UK&apos;.  But more than this, last week&apos;s chaos has raised fundamental questions about the future of Heathrow and air travel. As a global transport hub, Heathrow is facing increased competition from other major airports, both in Europe and from places like Dubai, which have more scope for expansion. This competition comes as an increasing number of people take to the air. A new &apos;open skies&apos; agreement comes into force this weekend designed to further stimulate competition, with the result that transatlantic air travel could grow by as much as 15.5 per cent this year alone, according to America&apos;s Federal Aviation Authority. Given this, further pressure on Britain&apos;s airports is inevitable. And, in response, the government set out proposals last year for a third runway and a sixth terminal at Heathrow that would devour much of the surrounding area. &apos;Can we manage this?&apos; McDonald asked. &apos;Last week&apos;s events call it into question. Brown&apos;s committed to it publicly but Ruth Kelly (the Transport Secretary) is in hiding. They can&apos;t find a reason to get them off the hook. But all the major commentators are against it and for the first time we have sections of business coming out against it. My hope is that the chaos at T5 will give the government a reason to look rationally at future expansion at Heathrow and say no. They&apos;ve got to look at expanding the use of regional airports and not accede to the demands of the aviation industry.&apos; But many aviation experts - and the eco-lobby - believe McDonald&apos;s hopes may be forlorn. There is a widespread belief the government will back continued expansion at Heathrow and that approval for the third runway is a certainty. In a future where the world&apos;s airports are locked in intense competition and deflationary price pressures, last week&apos;s chaos may be a taste of things to come. \u00b7 Additional reporting Caroline Davies and Tim Webb Failure at take-off Heathrow&apos;s Terminal 5 is not alone in suffering teething problems on its first day.

The Rolling Stones are staying over there, my driver says, pointing out of the window as we speed down Unter den Linden in central Berlin. And Penelope Cruz there. Each hotel is fronted by a gaggle of paparazzi sunning themselves on the pavement. It&apos;s the Berlinale, the annual film festival, and I&apos;m here to meet the founders of a countercultural magazine with designs on the television and movie industry. Back in 1994, three friends in Montreal - Shane Smith, Suroosh Alvi and Gavin McInnes - bought out Voice of Montreal, a magazine funded by the Canadian government as part of a welfare programme to provide work and promote community service. After a fallout with the original publisher, they wrested control, dropped the &apos;o&apos; (&apos;for legal reasons&apos;, Smith explains over a kebab) and Vice was born.  &apos;We wanted to be the first international voice for the universality of youth sub-culture,&apos; says Smith. At 38, he now looks more like a media mogul than a countercultural hipster. In just over a decade Vice has gone from little more than a fanzine to a magazine with 900,000 readers in 22 countries and an international brand which takes in clothing, TV, book publishing, music (Bloc Party has released an album in the US through Vice Records) and now film.  &apos;Vice&apos; is practically a definition of the magazine&apos;s content. All off-kilter life is here. Skaters feature alongside interviews with the likes of Abu Hamza. And its take-no-prisoners approach has captured the imagination of what marketing people call &apos;trendsetting metropolitans&apos; aged 21 to 34. The Cassandra Report, the influential consumer guide, named the magazine the number-one tastemaker in this crucial demographic for the past five years. The magazine&apos;s roster of photographers includes Terry Richardson, Ryan McGinley, Richard Kern, Dash Snow and Observer contributors Jamie-James Medina, Alex Sturrock and Danielle Levitt. Richardson is famed for his point-and-shoot style and has shot campaigns for Gucci, Levi&apos;s and American Apparel. McGinley, a former photo editor for the magazine who still contributes cover shots, was the youngest person ever to have a solo show at the Whitney in New York.  &apos;I first saw Vice in my local video store,&apos; McGinley tells me from his Manhattan studio. &apos;I hadn&apos;t seen anything like it before.&apos; As one of a group of young, up-and-coming photographers and writers, McGinley recorded the fast life of the magazine and its friends in New York&apos;s Lower East Side. &apos;Things back then were crazy,&apos; McGinley concedes, &apos;but these images were just a part of my life. When you group all the images together though, as they were in Vice, it creates a myth.&apos; These images are now included in a lavish coffee-table album, The Vice Photo Book, which reveals the magazine&apos;s strikingly broad range of photography, from serious photojournalism to party snapshots to nudes. &apos;Vice runs everything,&apos; says McGinley. &apos;It happily runs full-frontal nudity, which is pretty ballsy.&apos; Jamie-James Medina, 25, who started working for the magazine when he was 19 and made his name photographing London&apos;s burgeoning grime scene, agrees. Now focusing more on photojournalism, Medina has travelled to Tokyo, Bangkok, Jamaica, Sudan, China and North Korea with Vice. &apos;I love the fact Terry Richardson can shoot girls, Ryan McGinley can shoot this beautiful art photography and I can sneak in there with a bit of photojournalism,&apos; he says.  The magazine&apos;s range has broadened enormously in recent years. As Medina puts it: &apos;Hipsters grow up. It&apos;s just not cool to be dumb any more.&apos; Later, at dinner in a Twenties-style Berlin bierhaus, Smith appears, sporting a Kim Jong-Il lapel badge he was given by a general he befriended in North Korea while making an undercover documentary. I ask him about the criticism Vice has faced over the years. &apos;There was a time in the Nineties when it was all about cocaine and asymmetrical zippers,&apos; Smith admits. &apos;We did a lot of drugs and went to a lot of parties and had sex with a lot of supermodels. But you realise there&apos;s a whole world out there, and as we&apos;ve expanded, the scope of the magazine has got broader.&apos; To that end, Smith has set up VBS.tv, an online television station which boasts Spike Jonze as its creative director. &apos;They&apos;re inventing new things every day,&apos; says Tom Freston, a creator of MTV and former head of Viacom. &apos;It reminds me of MTV in the early days.&apos;  &apos;We became a magazine when the barriers to making a magazine effectively became nonexistent,&apos; explains Smith. &apos;You could do desktop publishing on a Mac and print for cheap. Now you get a digicam and a Mac, and you can have something broadcast on the net within 15 minutes.&apos; It was VBS that premiered Heavy Metal in Baghdad, a documentary about four young metal fans in the war-torn city trying to rehearse and play gigs to a tiny group of like-minded fans before escaping to Syria. The film won critical acclaim at the Toronto International Film Festival. Its producer, Monica Hampton, and editor, Bernardo Loyola, worked with Michael Moore on Fahrenheit 9/11. So where do the magazine&apos;s political allegiances lie? &apos;We&apos;re not trying to say anything politically in a paradigmatic left/right way,&apos; argues Smith. &apos;We don&apos;t do that because we don&apos;t believe in either side. Are my politics Democrat or Republican? I think both are horrific. And it doesn&apos;t matter anyway. Money runs America; money runs everywhere.&apos; The Vice brand - for all its dislike of celebrity - now has a growing band of celebrity followers. As well as Jonze, Hollywood stars Luke Wilson, Johnny Knoxville and the film director Michel Gondry are all friends of Vice. More unlikely still is the Bono connection. &apos;I have to admit we&apos;ve also started working with Bono. I should hate him,&apos; Smith laughs, &apos;but he&apos;s a good guy.&apos; The &apos;good guy&apos; has called VBS &apos;punk rock for the 21st century&apos;, so one wouldn&apos;t really expect Smith to describe him any other way.  After dinner, we move on to a party in an old warehouse in East Berlin. The walls are covered in peeling paint, and Berlin&apos;s hipsters are queuing to get in. Peaches, the New York DJ, is playing, and Smith and Alvi are circling the room. Among the party talk I hear snatches of conversation about international distribution deals and future projects. Earlier that evening, under the disco ball, Smith said of the early years: &apos;We definitely tried to put our flag in the sand against the status quo media.&apos; Now the line attached to online TV station VBS reads: &apos;In 10 years, we&apos;ll be the mainstream.&apos; \u00b7  To order a copy of The Vice Photo Book for \u00a325.95 with free UK p&amp;p, go to www.theguardian.com/bookshop or call 0870 836 0875", "publicationDate": "2008-03-30T11:43:24Z", "tags": ["Consumer magazines", "Magazines", "Newspapers & magazines", "Television industry", "Media", "Culture", "Television", "Life and style", "Television & radio", "Vice magazine"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/mar/30/pressandpublishing.tvandradioarts", "title": "Carl Wilkinson on how teen-zine Vice finally grew up", "sentences": ["Now focusing more on photojournalism, Medina has travelled to Tokyo, Bangkok, Jamaica, Sudan, China and North Korea with Vice."]}, {"article": "Tibetan protesters storm gate of China&apos;s visa office Tibetan exiles and Buddhist monks tried to break down the gate of the Chinese embassy visa office in Kathmandu yesterday but were beaten back by police.

In the eyes of environmentalists, and more than a few people who just hate the airport, here was a massive poke in the eye for British Airways, the aviation lobby, Heathrow expansionists and lots of other people richly deserving of it. It is one of those unpublic relations triumphs that will enter the history books: 15,000 bags lost in a weekend, more than 200 flights cancelled, the collapse of years of hype. Last April, one starstruck previewer of the Rogers fun palace wrote: &quot;Every system in the building is now being tested and tested, and the signs are good. Just a handful of bags have gone missing in trials ... T5 will transform Heathrow from a teeming slum of puke-fleck carpets and endless queues into a new shining city on the hill.&quot; In your dreams, friend. It will take years for BA&apos;s image to recover from the headlines and top-of-the-news footage of travellers sobbing over their suitcases. It was vital to the airline, and to the hated airport owner and operator BAA, that the launch of the terminal should be seen to succeed. What in God&apos;s name can senior executives have been doing all these months, to set the scene for chaos ? Answers are not far to seek. BA&apos;s management, especially of industrial relations, has been languishing for years. A highly unionised workforce is disaffected; in some cases, destructively bolshie. Britain&apos;s record of delivering big infrastructure projects is poor, which is why many of us tremble for the 2012 Olympics. It seemed implausible that a new terminal should slip seamlessly into service at one of the most shambolic airports on earth. It would be foolish to idealise the experience of flying with any airline. I recently took seven Qantas flights to various Australian cities. All but one took off an hour or more late. However much passengers moan, most transatlantic regulars whom I know stick with BA. They find Virgin and US alternatives no better. BMI has achieved an enviable reputation for punctuality, but covers few long-haul routes.  Society, and especially British society, has got itself into a shocking mess about flying. Almost all of us expect to do it, but we find it an ever more bitter experience. Plane captains make sport of their victims by saying on landing: &quot;We hope you have enjoyed your flight.&quot; Only the sort of flagellant who fancies weekends as a guest of the Spanish Inquisition could succumb to any such sensation.  In the next month, I am due to fly to Jordan for pleasure, then to America to work. The prospect of facing Heathrow four times before May Day fills me with the sort of apprehension one might experience about being asked to take on the Mahdi army in Basra. Most travellers feel the same.  Yet somehow, we go on doing it. The greens must be right about one big thing: the world flies too much, too cheaply. It is crazy that, within the UK, it costs far less to fly to most urban destinations than to take a train. In particular, if landing at Heathrow cost airlines more, they would send fewer flights there.  BAA was already losing its propaganda battle for a fourth runway, even before the Terminal Five nonsense unfolded. Now, that game is surely over. It is most unlikely that the necessary political and public consensus can be achieved for further expansion in Hounslow. BAA and the airlines have pressed the case, because they want to boost Heathrow&apos;s status as a global hub. But it seems one thing to provide necessary landing space to ensure that visitors can get into London, quite another to promote a surge in transit passengers to other destinations.  I part company with the greens, however, about their opposition to further airport expansion anywhere in southern Britain. Despite soaring fuel costs and environmental awareness, people will go on demanding and needing to fly. No nation unwilling to renounce economic growth can simply slam the door, batten down the hatches, foreclose on the global aviation industry.  The only credible place for a new London airport is in the Thames Estuary, with apologies to the seabirds. As a young reporter covering the 1960s controversy about the expansion of Stansted, I remember once visiting Foulness, which even then was being mooted as a runway site. To be sure, it is an unwelcome as well as vastly costly prospect, to cover the marshes in concrete. But in 1967 south-east Essex looked by far the most rational choice to everybody except the airline industry and an accommodating government. It seems even more so today.  As for BA, far from gloating over its troubles, I am among those who mourn. This is the only global carrier that this country is ever going to have. If BA folds or merges - by no means impossible - no other British contender can pick up the baton. Like many other soppy citizens, I want to love the airline, if it will let me.  I yearn to recapture the sense of warmth, of coming home, which one experienced in the old days on clambering into a BA cabin in some godforsaken city on the far side of the world. You laugh. Yet that is how some of us used to feel.  In recent times, the airline has lost its vision of service. I told a friend in the aviation industry a few months ago that I found it hard to get letters answered or phone calls returned. He said: &quot;BA is now run by people who see the business in terms of managing the economics of landing slots at Heathrow and Gatwick, not keeping passengers happy.&quot;  The horror stories are endless. My wife, flying from London to join me in Sydney a couple of months ago, found herself stuck for several hours in Bangkok because the BA relief crew failed to get to the airport from their hotel on time. Bad traffic, they said with a giggle. Delays, cancellations, lost baggage are endemic.  A BA passenger from Heathrow to Edinburgh often spends more than two hours in the aircraft, never mind at airports. BMI seems able to do domestic runs far more reliably. If it was not for the host of business travellers addicted to collecting BA air miles, the airline would be haemorrhaging passengers at a really dramatic rate. It is ironic that so few airlines are able to make steady money out of the overcrowded skies. Warren Buffett memorably observed that the Wright Brothers would have done the world&apos;s investors a favour if they had stuck to bicycle repair. Airport shopping franchises and the monstrously inflated security industry make a good living out of the miseries of tens of millions of passengers a day, but nobody much else does. Terminal Five will presumably overcome its teething nightmare, but the memory will not fade. There are no cheap or easy answers to the myriad contradictions today entangling British airports, airlines, government policy and passengers. What seems certain is that we cannot merely prescribe ourselves more of the same. comment@theguardian.com", "publicationDate": "2008-03-30T23:04:13Z", "tags": ["British Airways", "Airline industry", "Travel and transport", "Business", "Environment", "Travel", "Heathrow", "Transport", "UK news", "Air transport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/31/britishairwaysbusiness.theairlineindustry", "title": "Max Hastings: I mourn for British Airways.

Songkran, or Thai new year, is celebrated on April 13-15 every year. Traditionally, perfumed water is poured on to hands in a purifying ritual. Of course, here at Nibbles we&apos;re pure enough already, but we&apos;ll be getting in to the spirit of things all the same. You don&apos;t need to jet off to Bangkok to join in - we&apos;ve found the best events taking place around the country. In London, Mango Tree is really going to town, with a five-day spectacular celebrating regional Thailand. The festivities kick off on April 9, with a special menu (\u00a320 a head), plus music, folklore and dancing. There is also a new year menu on offer at the Blue Elephant, though prices are quite steep: starters cost around \u00a39 and mains climb as high as \u00a324. Elsewhere, the Sangthai restaurant in York is offering a celebratory set menu from April 15-20, and - notably - a separate menu for vegetarians (both \u00a328). The Thai Grand in Loughborough is celebrating on one day only, April 14, with live music and traditional dancing. In Hampshire, the Zen Garden restaurant at Senspa, Careys Manor House, is hosting a Taste of Thailand night, also on April 14. It features massage and cookery demonstrations, dinner, bucks fizz and dancing, all for \u00a337.50. Finally, the Tongdam restaurant in Somerset is offering special menus for a full week, starting on April 7. If you really want to celebrate in style, book a place on the Harrods/Nahm Thai cookery course, taking place this Saturday (April 5). The day involves a private tour of the Harrods food hall with Nahm&apos;s executive chef, a hands-on cookery lesson in the Nahm kitchen and a sumptuous Thai banquet. The course costs \u00a3155; call 020 7893 8155 for more information. For a slightly more affordable Nahm experience, book a table on April 12 or 13 to sample the new year menu. At \u00a355 a head, it&apos;s the most expensive in town - but it&apos;s probably the best. Alternatively, whip up a Thai feast at home. We like Yotam Ottolenghi&apos;s modern take on a Thai green curry; Allegra McEvedy&apos;s Thai salad; and Terry Tan&apos;s easy Thai dishes. As it&apos;s a special occasion, give the beer a miss and try a German riesling - its sweetness works well with the spicy flavours.

Associated Press in Cairo PM attacks fortune-teller over coup prediction The Thai prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, berated a fortune-teller yesterday for predicting that his government would face unrest next month and suggested the seer might have had an ulterior motive. Samak said his &quot;reputation was damaged&quot; by the widely reported prediction that he would instigate a military coup against his own government. &quot;Is someone asking him to do this?&quot; said Samak. Though he did not name the seer, it was clear he was referring to Warin Buawiratlert, a fortune-teller who is reputed to be close to members of the military who ousted Thaksin Shinawatra in a coup in 2006.

Did you know that the same journeys can often be made on regular trains, for a fraction of the price? But whether you splash out on luxury or ride with the locals, a train journey reveals far more of a country than any internal flight. Here are a few examples: 1. Cape Town to Pretoria on South Africa&apos;s Blue Train Fifty years ago, when your Union Castle liner docked at Cape Town, you might have taken the Blue Train to Johannesburg, South Africa&apos;s economic powerhouse figuratively and literally built on gold. Today&apos;s Blue Train is aimed fairly and squarely at tourists, but it still links Cape Town with Johannesburg, or rather Pretoria, the safer administrative capital, once or twice a week. A gentleman&apos;s club on rails, its double-glazed windows are tinted with real gold, and meals - and even (to my pleasant surprise) Montecristo cigars - are included in the fare on the 27-hour journey. Utter luxury comes with scenery to match: views of Table Mountain as the train heads out of Cape Town through the wine regions at Stellenbosch and Paarl, then into the veldt and up the scenic Hex River Pass.  \u00b7 Fares start at around \u00a3580, bluetrain.co.za. The affordable alternatives: You can enjoy exactly the same scenery for just \u00a323 including a sleeper, aboard the regular four-times-weekly Shosholoza Meyl train from Cape Town to Johannesburg. Shosholoza Meyl passenger trains link major South African cities and have to be one of South Africa&apos;s best-kept travel secrets. Comfortable, cheap and safe, they have basic sleepers (shared two- and four-bed compartments, with a hot shower at the end of the corridor) and a restaurant car selling meals, snacks, beer and South African wine. The train isn&apos;t air-conditioned, so the windows open for great views of Africa. Bring your own cigar! \u00b7 See seat61.com/SouthAfrica.htm  \u00b7 For a touch of luxury that&apos;s still five times cheaper than the Blue Train, a twice-weekly Premier Classe train also links Cape Town with Jo&apos;burg, with private sleepers, lounge car and restaurant, for \u00a3107 per person including meals. premierclasse.co.za  2. Singapore to Bangkok on the Eastern &amp; Oriental Express Once a week, the ultra-luxurious Eastern &amp; Oriental Express leaves Singapore&apos;s 1932-built art deco railway station, bound for Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Bangkok. On board you&apos;ll find private en suite sleepers, lounges, a haute cuisine restaurant car and an open air viewing car. The &apos;E&amp;O&apos; rumbles across the famous causeway from Singapore into Malaysia, through the palm plantations of the Malay peninsula, making a brief diversion to Kanchanaburi and the infamous Bridge on the River Kwai on its way to the Thai capital.  \u00b7 Prices for the two-day trip start at \u00a31,100 including meals,  orient-express.com/web/eoe/journeys/3_65110.jsp The affordable alternative: Regular daily trains ply exactly the same tracks, and a seat on an air-conditioned express from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur is yours for \u00a312 one-way. Or hang the expense, go first class for \u00a324. Another \u00a36 train ride and you&apos;re in Penang. A sleeping-berth on the International Express from Penang to Bangkok costs just \u00a319, with fresh clean sheets and curtains for privacy, like those used by Marilyn Monroe in Some Like it Hot. Bring your own Marilyn!  \u00b7 seat61.com/Malaysia.htm 3. London to Venice on the Venice Simplon Orient Express At first I doubted that any 24-hour train ride could be worth \u00a31,400. But by the end of the trip, the beautifully-restored carriages, superb cuisine, surprisingly unpretentious service and great scenery convinced me that it was. Not to mention somehow getting engaged on the way, as the train meandered through amazingly scenic Arlberg and Brenner Passes. This is two train rides in one, a daytime journey from London to Folkestone in restored British Pullman cars with champagne and afternoon tea, then a sleeper trip from Calais to Venice in 1929 vintage Wagons-Lits, with dinner, breakfast and lunch taken in a choice of three elegant restaurant cars.  \u00b7 \u00a31,400,  orient-expresstrains.com  The affordable alternative: It may not be the Orient Express, but train travel to Italy is a doddle on regular trains. Hop on an afternoon Eurostar to Paris and a sleeper train will whisk you overnight to Florence, Rome, Verona or Venice, with a restaurant car for dinner and private sleepers with comfy beds. London-Paris starts at \u00a359 return standard class, or \u00a3149 return first class with wine and meal included. Paris to Venice, Florence or Rome starts at \u00a328 each way in a shared couchette, or \u00a3110 each way in a two-bed sleeper with light breakfast included.  \u00b7 seat61.com/Italy.htm or call Rail Europe on 0844 8485848. 4. Rajasthan aboard the Palace on Wheels If you&apos;ve \u00a31,500 to spare, you can live like a Maharajah aboard the Palace on Wheels on a seven-day tour of Rajasthan. The itinerary includes Agra and the Taj Mahal, princely Jaipur, the lake city of Udaipur and the breathtaking fairytale citadel of Jaisalmer. With air conditioning, private en suite sleepers, restaurant, lounges and bar, it&apos;s the luxury way to see the Princely States.  \u00b7\u00a31,500, palaceonwheels.net  The affordable alternative: An IndRail pass costs $135 (\u00a368) for seven days, $185 (\u00a393) for 15 days, giving unlimited air-conditioned travel across the whole Indian Railways network. If you&apos;re sure of your itinerary, the excellent family-run SD Enterprises in Wembley (windiarail.co.uk, +44 (0)20 8903 3411) can pre-book some or all your trains for you free of charge. Delhi, Varanasi, Agra, Jaipur, Jaisalmer and Simla makes a great two-week itinerary, contrasting desert cities with cool hill stations, a holy city on the Ganges with princely Rajasthan. Overnight sleepers between many cities save both time and hotel bills, even compared to flying. Forget images of overcrowded trains with passengers hanging out the doors \u2013 in air-conditioned class you&apos;ll have your own reserved berth, fresh, clean bedding provided, and plenty of room. With every journey you&apos;ll experience the real India, with cries of &quot;chai, chai, garam chai&quot; (wonderful hot sweet tea) from attendants walking the train, and hot cheap curries (veg or non-veg) served at your seat.  \u00b7 You can also book Indian train tickets online, at irctc.co.in.  5. West Highlands of Scotland aboard the Royal Scotsman The Royal Scotsman is a luxury train that&apos;s closer to home, but with all the trimmings of its overseas counterparts. En suite staterooms, elegant dining, and what is arguably some of Britain&apos;s best scenery passing the window in the wild and remote west highlands of Scotland.  \u00b7 A three-night tour along the West Highland Line from Edinburgh to Mallaig starts at \u00a32,530 per person for two people sharing. Transport to Edinburgh is not included. royalscotsman.com/web/rs/journeys/3_55386.jsp The affordable alternative: A berth on the Caledonian Sleeper from London to Fort William costs \u00a378 one-way, \u00a3112 return, if you book in advance. A miniature hotel with compact one and two-bed compartments, plus a lounge car complete with tables, chairs and even leather sofas (the only ones on any regular scheduled British train!), it&apos;ll take you from the drizzly capital to the foot of Ben Nevis before domestic air travellers have recovered from their 4am drive to the airport. A wee dram of Glenfiddich in the lounge and you&apos;ll be asleep before Crewe, waking up in the highlands wilderness where a glimpse of bounding fluffy white tail might explain the train&apos;s unofficial name: &quot;The Deerstalker&quot;\u2026  \u00b7 See firstscotrail.com or call 08457 550033", "publicationDate": "2008-04-07T11:53:18Z", "tags": ["Rail travel", "Green travel", "South Africa holidays", "India holidays", "Singapore holidays", "Malaysia holidays", "Thailand holidays", "Venice holidays", "Scotland holidays", "United Kingdom holidays", "Travel"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/apr/07/rail.traintravel", "title": "Man in Seat 61's top train trips", "sentences": ["Singapore to Bangkok on the Eastern &amp; Oriental Express Once a week, the ultra-luxurious Eastern &amp; Oriental Express leaves Singapore&apos;s 1932-built art deco railway station, bound for Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Bangkok.", "A sleeping-berth on the International Express from Penang to Bangkok costs just \u00a319, with fresh clean sheets and curtains for privacy, like those used by Marilyn Monroe in Some Like it Hot."]}, {"article": "A former Thai MP is facing up to two years&apos; imprisonment and a \u00a316.4m libel damages claim after he criticised Tesco&apos;s aggressive expansion in his country. The retailer, trading as Tesco Lotus in Thailand, also issued a second libel writ against a newspaper columnist and academic who faces bankruptcy if he loses the action, in which Tesco is claiming damages of \u00a31.6m. Both men, Jit Siratranont, 56, now vice general secretary of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, and Kamol Kamoltrakul, 57, a business writer, said they would fight the retailer&apos;s enormous damages claims. Free speech campaigners are outraged by Tesco Lotus&apos;s &quot;heavy-handed&quot; tactics, that they believe are designed to intimidate and silence critics alarmed over the company&apos;s growth in Thailand. &quot;Defamation suits of this nature and of such absurd proportions are clearly meant to harass legitimate criticism, intimidate independent media, and stifle discussions and debate over legitimate public concerns,&quot; said Roby Alampay, of the South-east Asian Press Alliance (Seapa). &quot;Seapa sees the Tesco Lotus suits as harassment, pure and simple.&quot; Jit, 56, was served with writs for criminal defamation and civil libel last November after he made a speech to activists at Bangkok&apos;s Kasetsart University, saying Tesco Lotus&apos;s expansion was &quot;aggressive&quot;. He said the growth came at the expense of Thailand&apos;s &quot;mom-and-pop&quot; small retailers which could not compete with the company&apos;s superstores and hypermarkets that total more than 370 outlets across the country. In the speech he mistakenly said that Tesco Lotus contributed 37% of the company&apos;s global revenues, an error Kamol also made in his column in BangkokBizNews last October. Both concede their error. But it was raised in the writ served on Jit, as well as the civil libel writ Kamol received last month. Kamol&apos;s allegation that Tesco Lotus used complex accounting structures to repatriate revenues to the UK parent to minimise its Thai tax bill was also highlighted. &quot;I think the main purpose of this is not to get my money - I don&apos;t have any - but to keep me quiet,&quot; said Kamol, an economics lecturer at Bangkok&apos;s Assumption University. &quot;They&apos;re trying to intimidate me.&quot; Jit echoed the view that Tesco Lotus was employing scare tactics to shut him up. But with the Thai Chamber of Commerce&apos;s backing he refuses to be quiet, and is adamant that Tesco Lotus has failed to show how he damaged its business or reputation. &quot;Tesco Lotus picks on weaker people like myself to create fear,&quot; said Jit. &quot;They want me to be afraid so I can&apos;t sleep at night. But I&apos;m not worried. The chamber of commerce committee supports me on this.&quot; A Tesco spokesman said: &quot;Tesco is of course not trying to intimidate Mr Kamol or Mr Jit, but we do have a right to defend our company and our colleagues against false allegations. We took this action reluctantly but felt we had no choice after a sustained campaign of misinformation spread by the two individuals over many months.  &quot;Tesco does not have a history of acting through the courts and will only do so under extreme provocation. In fact until 2008 we had never taken any libel action at all. It would therefore be irresponsible and misleading to suggest that Tesco had a policy of attempting to suppress criticism.&quot; The rapid growth of international retailers in Thailand has been a political issue for almost a decade, as expansion came at the expense of small shops whose prices were undercut. The political heat generated by the issue led Tesco&apos;s joint-venture partner, the Charoen Pokphand Group, to sell all its shares in the Thai arm of the business to the UK parent in 2003 and 2004. A lawyer familiar with Thai libel cases, Sinfah Punsarawuth, said that companies invariably file hugely inflated damages claims, but in reality the courts had never made an award greater than \u00a333,000. The Thai division has been run by Tesco executive Jeff Adams, who was recently flown to the US in a plan to boost operations at the company&apos;s troubled California end. The US division, operating under the name Fresh and Easy, has also run into political criticism from activists. Tesco said yesterday they had no plans to issue any libel proceedings in the US. Tesco has recently also launched libel proceedings in the UK against the Guardian, saying the paper was mistaken in its criticisms of the company&apos;s offshore tax structures.", "publicationDate": "2008-04-08T07:39:23Z", "tags": ["Tesco", "Supermarkets", "Business", "Thailand", "World news", "Newspapers & magazines", "Media", "National newspapers", "Newspapers", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/apr/08/tesco.supermarkets", "title": "Tesco sues critic of its expansion in Thailand for \u00a316.4m damages", "sentences": ["&quot;Seapa sees the Tesco Lotus suits as harassment, pure and simple.&quot; Jit, 56, was served with writs for criminal defamation and civil libel last November after he made a speech to activists at Bangkok&apos;s Kasetsart University, saying Tesco Lotus&apos;s expansion was &quot;aggressive&quot;.", "In the speech he mistakenly said that Tesco Lotus contributed 37% of the company&apos;s global revenues, an error Kamol also made in his column in BangkokBizNews last October.", "&quot;I think the main purpose of this is not to get my money - I don&apos;t have any - but to keep me quiet,&quot; said Kamol, an economics lecturer at Bangkok&apos;s Assumption University."]}, {"article": "The news that the hymn Jerusalem has been banned from Southwark Cathedral has inevitably been denounced by conservative churchmen as evidence of the politically correct namby-pambyism of the Anglican establishment. But this rather misses the point. In the past, some clergymen have objected to its supposed nationalist overtones, perhaps thinking of its popularity with the braying yahoos at the Last Night of the Proms. But the objection of the Dean of Southwark, Colin Slee, is more nuanced: he argues that Jerusalem is &quot;not in the glory of God&quot;; essentially that, in Anglican terms at least, it isn&apos;t really a hymn. And, you know what? He&apos;s right. Blake never wrote it as a hymn; it&apos;s the preface to his long, obscure poem Milton, and it was only when Hubert Parry set it to music in 1916, as an attempt to rally a war-weary public, that it began to be interpreted in the jingoistic terms beloved of the Daily Telegraph. In any case, the notion of Blake&apos;s idiosyncratic theology sitting neatly within the confines of orthodox Anglicanism is preposterous. Blake might just about have defined himself as a Christian, but his was a Christianity that combined elements of mysticism, Manichaeist dualism, anti-industrial pastoralism and Enlightenment radicalism. His Jesus was a prototype hippy freedom fighter, with God the father as a distant, dark presence. His writing, and the thoughts underlying it, are wilfully ambiguous; notice how the first verse of Jerusalem is composed entirely of questions? It&apos;s a provocation, a starting point, a basis for heated discussion, a call to spiritual - and social and political and aesthetic - arms. And it&apos;s this ambiguity that has allowed Jerusalem to be taken up by all the major British political parties, the Women&apos;s Institute, Emerson, Lake and Palmer, and Billy Bragg. It&apos;s been on the soundtrack of films as diverse as Chariots of Fire (plucky Brits defeat Johnny foreigner) and Brassed Off (the scrapheap of Thatcherism). It&apos;s driven me to tears of homesickness in a chapel on the outskirts of Toronto and a bar in downtown Bangkok. It&apos;s to be howled at cricket matches and hummed in private contemplation, and fought and argued over with a pint in hand. If the Church of England wants to maintain any semblance of ideological cohesiveness, it should renounce Blake and all his works.

The Olympic flame will be carried by 80 runners on a 12 mile circuit of the Australian capital. On the orders of Kevin Rudd, the prime minister, Chinese security personnel will not guard the flame, with that job going to the Australian Federal Police Force.

At least 1,000 members of Australia&apos;s Chinese community have booked 50 buses to Canberra to show their support.

In an echo of the standoffs that have disrupted the its route through London, Paris and San Francisco this week, human rights groups greeted the Olympic symbol with an alternative &quot;torch for human rights&quot; only to be met by several thousand representatives of Argentina&apos;s Chinese community, who gathered opposite with flags and banners in Chinese. &quot;Our intention is not to do anything against the Olympics nor to disrupt the relay of the official torch,&quot; said Ileana Alesco, one of the protest organisers. Numbering over 200, the alternative relay included members of pro-Tibet groups, dissident Chinese exiles and members of the Falun Gong religious sect. &quot;We are trying to wake up people in China. This protest is to help Chinese citizens better understand the atrocities happening in their own country,&quot; said Alvaro Colombres, 26, a student. But after the chaos and farce that marred earlier stops this week, Argentine officials scrambled to avoid trouble. &quot;We think it&apos;s fine if there are protests, but we will accept them only if they are peaceful,&quot; said a sports official, Francisco Irarrazabal. &quot;We hope there will be no physical aggression.&quot; About 1,300 federal police, 1,500 naval police and 3,000 traffic police and volunteers were deployed along the eight-mile relay route - enough to ensure security &quot;without going to the extreme that nobody will be able to see the torch,&quot; Irarrazabal said. The Olympic flame, in an ornately decorated lantern, was being protected by Chinese guards. The torch was hustled off the plane on its arrival from San Francisco on Thursday, as officials cancelled plans for photographs to be taken. Guards loaded the lantern on to a bus and rushed to a secret location, escorted by wailing police cars and an ambulance. Local security officials would not say where it was headed. Following the Buenos Aires relay, the torch will be put aboard a Chinese jetliner and flown to Tanzania. In Beijing, the international protests against the crackdown in Tibet are drawing increasing anger. A foreign ministry spokeswoman said yesterday that the government was outraged by the US House of Representatives resolution urging it to open dialogue with the Dalai Lama and halt repression in Tibet. Jiang Yu said officials were &quot;strongly indignant and resolutely opposed&quot; to the motion, the official Xinhua news agency reported. &quot;It is confusing black with white and is vicious-minded of certain members of the US House of Representatives to not only fail to condemn the attacks, smashing, looting and arson in Lhasa ... but rather to point the spear at the Chinese government and people,&quot; Jiang said.  But web users focused their outrage on the attempt to grab the torch from a Paralympic fencer in Paris. Jin Jing, 27, has been dubbed &quot;the angel in a wheelchair&quot; and has come to symbolise Chinese national pride in the face of western criticism after fending off the protester.  &quot;I still feel very angry now ... Hosting the Olympics is such a good thing for our country, so why do they want to ruin it?&quot; she told Reuters.  Tens of thousands of internet users posted comments about the incident, with one writing: &quot;I thought we had lost in France, but seeing the young disabled torch bearer Jin Jing&apos;s radiant smile of conviction, I know in France we did not lose, we won!&quot;  Some bloggers called for boycotts of French goods and one student posted pictures of the protester, writing: &quot;Remember him ... he&apos;ll die a terrible death.&quot; Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee, has said that the torch relay had been hijacked by campaigners. He also said athletes would be disappointed if world leaders shunned the opening ceremony. Gordon Brown is to skip the event and attend the closing ceremony instead. Though Downing Street says this is not a boycott, it may encourage others to do the same. Where next?

Our expert panel offers inspiration for five readers and their families - from caring for elephants in Thailand to music workshops in Tanzania. The music exchange &apos;I want to be instrumental in lending a hand&apos; Howard Foster, 32, a musician, from London The brief: &apos;I work as a freelance musician and play mostly keyboards or guitar. I was wondering if there&apos;s such a thing as a volunteering trip revolving around music. Perhaps I can teach or inspire others to take up an instrument. I thought of Europe because of the type of music I work with, but am really interested in music from around the world too, so it could be interesting to go further afield. I won&apos;t have a big budget, so accommodation/food in exchange for what I can offer would be good. Length of time depends on cost.&apos; Budget: as cheap as possible, less than \u00a31,500 The solution Chris Hill from Hands Up Holidays: &apos;We work with an orphanage in Thailand near the Burmese border. The children are mostly ethnic refugees from Burma. Most of our volunteers are involved in building or teaching projects, but there&apos;s a group of teenagers who love music and are very talented. They have formed a rock band and practise almost every afternoon after school and would welcome Howard&apos;s assistance. The volunteer accommodation is a five-minute walk from the orphanage, food would be included. I should mention it&apos;s all vegan - they do wonderful things with tofu. The wet season from May to September isn&apos;t really a good time to go, but any other time would be good and there are likely to be other volunteers around, too. This trip could be done, all-inclusive, for \u00a3550 for two weeks, plus flights from \u00a3450.&apos; Korina Miller from Lonely Planet: &apos;As you&apos;re on a tight budget, I&apos;d advise hooking up directly with an NGO abroad and combining your musical skills with community development. If you are open to a month-long experience, have a look at Association Iko Poran (ikoporan.org; \u00a3350, including accommodation, excluding airfare) which places volunteers with local NGOs in Brazil, usually in Rio or Salvador. Volunteers must take an active role in planning their involvement, based on their own skills and interests. Some past placements have centred on teaching music.  &apos;Also try Ecologia Youth Trust (ecologia.org.uk; \u00a3900 for up to two months, including visa, food and accommodation, excluding airfare), a community for orphaned children in picturesque Russian countryside, 300km south of Moscow. They welcome volunteers to teach English in innovative, creative ways, including through music. Ecologia arrange visas and travel and include a few days on either side of the placement to explore Moscow.&apos;  David Stitt from Gap Year for Grown Ups: &apos;Being a community volunteer in Tanzania would allow Howard to help disadvantaged children, youths and adults through teaching and music workshops. We work with several projects based in Dar es Salaam, in the Bahari Beach area, and he could choose to focus on one of the music education schemes. The projects aim to bring people together and educate the community through music and entertainment. &apos;Howard could help teach the locals how to play different musical instruments and assist with voice training. This would cost \u00a3849 for four weeks, with breakfast and dinner, not including flights. Accommodation is in a shared volunteers&apos; house not far from the Indian Ocean.&apos; The learning curve &apos;We would like to work with children&apos; Caroline Watson, 44, a social worker, husband Brendan, 43, a university lecturer, Camille, 14, and Aine, eight, from London The brief: &apos;I&apos;m looking for a two-week holiday where my whole family could volunteer in an orphanage or something similar working with children, perhaps teaching English. We like to travel to culturally different places, but we would like our children to experience first-hand what some of these countries experience in terms of poverty and the consequences for the lives of children. I was thinking of somewhere in south east Asia, possibly India, Cambodia or Vietnam.&apos;  Budget: could be pushed to \u00a34,000 The solution .Chris Hill from Hands Up Holidays: &apos;I would suggest a tailor-made trip that focuses on volunteering in an impoverished school in the slums of Delhi. Aine is a little young to teach but can interact with the other children and it will be an incredible experience in a safe context. They would stay with the school&apos;s founder on a fully inclusive basis. She&apos;s a very charismatic and inspiring individual and actually staying in someone&apos;s house hugely adds to the experience. It&apos;s a typical middle-class Indian family home, simple but comfortable.  &apos;They would also have a couple of days&apos; sightseeing in Delhi. The price would be \u00a32,500 for the whole family. Flights are available from \u00a3350, taking the total to \u00a33,900.&apos; Korina Miller from Lonely Planet: &apos;The main difficulty you&apos;re going to encounter is finding an organisation that will accept you and your family for only two weeks. The majority of orphanages want a minimum commitment of at least a month in order to lessen the turnover that the children have to cope with.  &apos;One organisation that does accept shorter-term placements is Casa Guatemala (casa-guatemala.org), an orphanage on Guatemala&apos;s River Dulce, a 20-minute boat ride from the town of Fronteras. Home to around 250 children, this charity cares for orphaned and poverty-stricken kids from the surrounding communities. Casa Guatemala has a hostel up the river from the orphanage, where short-term volunteers are housed. This organisation is very community-oriented and volunteers can get involved in every aspect of the orphanage, although teaching is generally a core activity. The cost would be just \u00a3150 per person per week - even with flights this would come within budget.&apos; Nikki Bond of Go Differently:  &apos;We do not usually recommend orphanages for short-term volunteering because needy children and/or volunteers can become quickly attached and, we believe, the potential emotional stress on both sides can actually outweigh any good.  &apos;Perhaps they might be interested in spending some time in a remote fishing village on the stunningly beautiful Andaman coast in Thailand? The project we support here was established to provide relief and then long-term sustainable improvements in the livelihoods of villagers affected by the 2004 tsunami. They will gain a fascinating insight into local culture by staying with a family, sharing their daily life, including learning how to cook Thai food, and can volunteer to teach English or assist with initiatives to provide alternative means of income, such as soap and batik workshops. The price for a one-week visit starts at around \u00a3500 per person based on a family of four, including flights from Bangkok, transfers, accommodation, all meals and activities.&apos; The Asian adventure &apos;Can I fit a big trip into just two weeks?&apos; Liz Biggs, 28, assistant TV producer, from London  The brief: &apos;My work means I often go from contract to contract without taking time off, but this year I really want to factor in an exciting trip. I love travelling and have done a lot in the past, but now can only really take two or three weeks off. I&apos;d be up for anything with a bit of adventure and activity to make the most of the time I have. I would do anything, clearing up beaches in Thailand or conservation projects, for example, and I also fancy horse-trekking through amazing scenery. All the volunteering trips I&apos;ve looked at seem to be very expensive though.&apos; Budget: up to \u00a31,500 The solution   Korina Miller from Lonely Planet: &apos;Fully organised programmes taking groups of volunteers abroad often come with hefty fees. However, as you are an experienced traveller and confident to head off independently, you can opt for an organisation operating in the destination country that offers you a placement but expects you to take care of the finer details such as air travel and accommodation. This might be ideal for you, as you can combine a week of vacation with one or two weeks volunteering. Try the Tsunami Volunteer Centre (tsunamivolunteer.net) in Khao Lak, Thailand, which offers two-week stints doing anything from cleaning up beaches to leading sessions in children&apos;s clubs or rebuilding homes. It costs \u00a345 for registration which includes transport to and from project sites and lunch.  &apos;Another group to consider is Fundaci\u00f3n Jatun Sacha (jatunsacha.org; about \u00a3150 for up to a month) where you contribute to reforestation or reserve maintenance in the rainforests of Ecuador or on the Galapagos Islands. You must cover all travel expenses but accommodation and meals are included in the fee.&apos; Chris Hill from Hands up Holidays: &apos;In India we work with a village in Sunderbans, a huge wetland area that borders Bangladesh. It&apos;s a model of community-based tourism, where tiger poachers have turned into tiger conservationists thanks to tourism. You fly to Calcutta and then it&apos;s a two-hour drive, followed by a two- to three-hour boat trip to get there, so it&apos;s extremely rural and would be a great adventure. Liz could help with mangrove planting which reduces the risk of flooding. She can mix this with boat trips to spot birds and tigers. Two days&apos; touring Calcutta with a guide is an option too, so it&apos;s quite varied and fits a lot into two weeks. The cost would be \u00a3900 for 11 days, with flights \u00a3400 extra, and additional time around Calcutta taking it to 14 days for \u00a31,500.&apos; David Stitt from Gap Year for Grown Ups: &apos;One that might suit is a two-week &quot;Horseback and Conservation Experience&quot; in South Africa. Based in the foothills of the Drakensberg Mountains close to Kruger National Park, you stay in a rustic bush camp, and ride in the African bush. There&apos;s a range of voluntary work, from caring for the horses, to anti-poaching initiatives. You&apos;ll also have the chance for game drives and walks, sleep-outs in the bush and lessons in basic bush survival. It costs \u00a3799 for two weeks, excluding flights, which should not cost more than \u00a3500.  &apos;Another idea is a three-week trip to Guatemala, where you&apos;re involved in helping to build houses for rural communities, with time to explore the culture and scenery of the country, climb its highest volcano and learn some Spanish, for \u00a3999. Again flights are not included but it shouldn&apos;t work out much over budget.&apos; The alternative family break &apos;Give us a project with adventure and animals&apos; Risa Mussett, a teacher, Millie, 10, and Laurence, 13, from Gloucester  The brief: &apos;I am a single mum with two kids and I&apos;m a secondary school teacher, so I can take a longer holiday during the summer. We&apos;re a sociable family and like to have a go at stuff. I have been hoping to take my kids on a genuine one-off trip which would give them something beyond the usual holiday experience. I think we&apos;d enjoy getting involved in a voluntary project for part of the time: the children like animal-type things. I have a lot of independent travel experience pre-kids, mostly in Asia, and want to take the kids somewhere they can experience wildlife, culture and adventure. They&apos;ve not been out of Europe before.&apos; Budget: up to \u00a34,000 The solution Nikki Bond from Go Differently: &apos;If you&apos;re looking for a trip that involves wildlife, culture and adventure, how about volunteering at the elephant camp we support in southern Thailand? You will each be allocated your &quot;own&quot; elephant for the duration of your stay (younger children may choose to share with their parents) and will have the opportunity to learn how to feed, ride and generally care for the animals as well as helping to support this friendly little project, which aims to create a safe haven for some of Thailand&apos;s domesticated elephants, many of which have been badly treated since traditional work in forestry has dried up.  &apos;Volunteers can choose to stay in a comfortable guesthouse nearby or actually at the camp itself, where they quickly become part of the village community and also have the opportunity to learn more about the traditional life of the mahouts (elephant handlers) and their families. Prices start from \u00a3320 per person per week including accommodation, most meals, English-speaking support and project fees (but not international flights).&apos; David Stitt from Gap Year for Grown Ups: &apos;How about joining the &quot;Kenya Village Life Family Programme&quot;? Typically the bulk of your time is spent working in the village primary school, while your children can interact and play with the local children and have plenty of fun. You will be involved with desk making, construction, painting, teaching, landscaping and tree planting. There may also be an opportunity to teach and coach sports and music. Ten days would cost \u00a32,600 per family (the minimum age is eight), this leaves \u00a31,400 for flights, so your budget would probably need to be upped a bit.&apos; Korina Miller from Lonely Planet: &apos;You could travel to Bolivia to help at the wildlife refuge run by the Inti Wara Yassi Community (intiwarayassi.org). It helps to rehabilitate wild animals that have been illegally caught and sold as pets or to collectors and circuses. &apos;Its programme is unstructured and you need to travel there independently. Families are welcome and the only requirements are &apos;a big heart and a willingness to work hard to save the animals&apos;, which include coatis and wild cats. There&apos;s a minimum stay of two weeks (which costs \u00a3150 including accommodation but not food) but if you want to be responsible for a specific animal, you need to stay for at least a month.&apos; The revolutionary route &apos;I&apos;m up for crafts, cooking or cleaning in Cuba&apos; Sarah Risner, 49, a further education teacher, from Truro THE BRIEF: &apos;What would you prescribe for a soon- to-be 50-year-old who would love to get to Cuba somehow but on a limited budget! It&apos;s a place I&apos;ve been wanting to visit and I think now is the time to go. I&apos;d like to volunteer and am open to anything - arts and crafts, cooking, building, painting, cleaning, counting, caring - but would rather not teach as I do this for a living. Ideally I&apos;d like to go for at least two weeks. Often single supplements make things expensive and volunteer holidays can be as much as staying in five stars!&apos; Budget: \u00a3800 The solution Rob Miller from the Cuba Solidarity Campaign: &apos;The Cuba Solidarity Campaign, or brigade as it is sometimes called, organises volunteer working holidays. These involve up to three weeks&apos; voluntary work, generally in agriculture - but as programmes vary depending on season and local needs, it can include bits of everything. Past groups have painted schools, built clinics and even helped clear a disused railway track.  &apos;Groups can be up to 30-strong and include people of all ages and backgrounds. You&apos;re based in citrus-producing countryside in a small village called Caimito, 30km from Havana, staying in purpose-built shared accommodation. There&apos;s a preparatory get-together in London before departure. A three-week trip costs \u00a3875 and includes absolutely everything, flights, transfers, visas, accommodation, food and a full and diverse itinerary, with visits to places of interest including Cuban schools and hospitals. There&apos;s no single supplement, and return flights can be extended at booking to give further time to explore the island. Groups depart at least twice a year, in July and December. As well as helping out, you&apos;ll have a unique experience and see a side of Cuba that most tourists miss.&apos;  Korina Miller from Lonely Planet: &apos;Volunteering after 40 is becoming increasingly popular. Nevertheless, finding a short-term placement in Cuba within your budget is certainly going to be a challenge. Other than the Cuba Solidarity Campaign, few groups offer placements within Cuba and those that do generally focus on teaching. Sarah could get in touch with Worldwide Volunteering (worldwidevolunteering.org.uk).

In the moonlight, with ammunition exhausted, the Luftwaffe pilot came alongside, saluted and then flew off. The plane&apos;s fuel gauges were on empty when the Wellington crash-landed on home soil. Within a month of that incident, all 25 of Charles&apos;s hut-mates on their RAF station had been shot down or killed, but his fortune held. Bomber Command&apos;s death rate was more than 40%, but after his mandatory 30 missions, he volunteered for a further 20. He survived hitting a bomb dump on take-off, his planes being hit by flak more than 20 times and a bomb passing, from higher altitude, through the wing. In 1943 he was awarded the DFC. In 1944 he was posted to India, moving on, as the war ended to Java, and Bangkok, where he was an air traffic controller. Once when the officers&apos; mess was low on beer he flew a bomber to his uncle&apos;s brewery in Rangoon and stocked up. Reprimanded by his superiors, he was much praised by his fellow officers.  Demobbed in 1946, Charles believed he had been saved by God for a purpose. In 1949 he began training to be an Anglican minister. After doctrinal disputes with the Bishop of Rochester in 1951 he set up his Goudhurst Free Evangelical Church in Kent, ministering to the travelling community in Kent and Sussex. Pastor &quot;Eyewood&quot; became a dogged advocate of the rights of what he perceived to be a persecuted minority. He baptised many of the travelling community with the help of a large white bedshirt and cold water in the &quot;rusty bath&quot; in Goudhurst parish hall.  Charles was born in Exton; his parents were owners of the Heavitree brewery in Exeter. He was educated at Sherborne school before he joined the RAF in 1941. His life as a preacher was not without cost, and his determination that he was chosen to do God&apos;s work led him to neglect his own personal and family needs. He married our mother in 1949, but the pressure of his work led to their separation in 1963.  He never abandoned his beliefs. His last few years were passed in a Christian care home, where he still led prayer meetings. He is survived by me, my brother Charles and our sister Sally.", "publicationDate": "2008-04-13T23:02:54Z", "tags": [], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2008/apr/14/3", "title": "Obituary: Charles Lywood", "sentences": ["In 1944 he was posted to India, moving on, as the war ended to Java, and Bangkok, where he was an air traffic controller."]}, {"article": "England&apos;s dismal year in international football is about to be rescued by an amateur team of middle-aged Yorkshiremen, including a bank manager, two builders, and a driver for a sausage-making firm. Wiped out of Euro 2008 and with no other major tournaments in sight, the country&apos;s empty fixture list has been filled at the last minute by Harrogate Veterans FC. Thanks to an unusual arrangement with the Football Association, the unpaid 11, whose combined age is more than 500, will take the field for England against Iran next week. Victory and good results against Taiwan and United Arab Emirates will steer them into the knockout stages of the Seniors World Cup (SWC). &quot;It&apos;s not quite the real thing, but we&apos;ll line up to the national anthem and they&apos;ll hoist the flag,&quot; says Paul Bell, a chocolate company executive and the squad&apos;s equivalent of England manager Fabio Capello. &quot;We haven&apos;t got Beckham or Rooney but we&apos;re tough and can go the distance.&quot; The vets were picked to fly the red and white flag as one of the country&apos;s leading over-40 clubs, who play by a modified version of the game. Matches are 10 minutes shorter than professional football&apos;s, and if a team takes off a 54-year-old, such as Harrogate wine merchant Ian Skinner, they must substitute someone of a similar age.

The global retailer, trading as Tesco Lotus, claims the business gossip writer for Bangkok Business News damaged the company&apos;s reputation when she said the company did not &quot;love&quot; Thailand. The offending article in Nongnart Harnvilai&apos;s tongue-in-cheek &quot;Buzz&quot; column was part of a collection of short stories on page 28 of the paper, and ran to just a few sentences. Six weeks after the article appeared on January 29, the journalist on the Thai-language business daily, part of the respected Nation newspaper group, received a writ from Tesco Lotus. Another of the paper&apos;s columnists, Kamol Kamoltrakul, had also been served with a libel writ from Tesco Lotus seeking 100m baht (\u00a31.6m) in damages 11 days earlier. A third Tesco Lotus critic, Jit Siratranont, former MP and now vice-general secretary of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, faces two years in jail accused of criminal libel, and a damages claim of 1.1bn baht (\u00a316.6m). Campaigners for free speech said the latest writ underscored Tesco Lotus&apos;s determination to stamp out criticism of its rapid expansion, which has been hotly debated for nearly a decade. &quot;Obviously Tesco Lotus is on the warpath,&quot; said Roby Alampay, of the South-east Asian Press Alliance (Seapa). &quot;It&apos;s out to silence not only criticism, but seems to want to stop anyone saying anything about the company. We find that very ominous.&quot;  A committee of the Thai Journalists Association concerned with the potential erosion of press freedom is due to meet the columnists today to discuss ways to combat Tesco Lotus&apos;s tactics. Next week, Thailand&apos;s Human Rights Commission is set to address the company&apos;s multiple libel writs and the tactic of going after individuals rather than the organisations they represent. Both Jit, 56, and Kamol, 58, had criticised Tesco Lotus&apos;s &quot;aggressive&quot; expansion in Thailand, saying it had come at the expense of small retailers who could not compete with company&apos;s 370 superstores and hypermarkets across the country. They also said the company had sought to minimise its Thai tax liabilities. Nongnart, 45, joined the fray when she remarked on Tesco Lotus&apos;s plans to open a further 130 outlets, saying Thai competitors were in for a tough time. &quot;Ha, Tesco Lotus doesn&apos;t love Thais,&quot; was her sign off. In the libel writ Tesco Lotus claimed the article had hurt its image and demanded \u00a31.6m to repair the damage. &quot;It was supposed to be funny,&quot; said Duangkamol Chotana, the Bangkok Business News editor. &quot;It&apos;s not even real criticism. I can&apos;t understand how Tesco Lotus feels damaged by this. I&apos;m surprised by their action because they should understand and respect media freedom.&quot; Bangkok Business News has said it will fight the actions and is backing both its columnists even though they - rather than it - were named in the writs. But Tesco Lotus denied it was involved in a witch-hunt against individuals and merely felt it had to protect its name. &quot;It has never been our policy to seek legal action against anyone unless the things they say about the company are blatantly untrue,&quot; said Darmp Sukontasap, a Tesco Lotus senior vice-president. &quot;I believe this was the case in this instance.

Few visitors stay around long enough to witness the kingdom&apos;s darker side - its gun-toting police force, the killing of Muslims in the disaffected south, and its&quot; war on drugs&quot;. The 2007 Thai election brought back the same politics, policies and Rambo-style approach to blasting all drug dealers off the face of the planet that had become the hallmarks of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra&apos;s regime, until it was toppled in 2006. Shinawatra, the billionaire ex-prime minister - the Silvio Berlusconi of Asia - snapped up Manchester City football club in a shrewd bid to shore up his popularity in football-crazy Thailand, after he was forced into exile after a military coup. He is facing charges of corruption and is still banned from political office. NGOs say he should be indicted for many other crimes including his trampling on human rights in the drug war, and his responsibility for the deaths of Muslims in Tak Bai in 2004. The new Thai government is based around Thaksin&apos;s allies and cronies. The minister of the interior, Chalerm Yubamrung, like Thaksin, is a police captain turned wealthy politician. He has wasted no time in bringing back one of the former prime minister&apos;s most controversial campaigns, the war on drugs. When it was first launched in 2003, the &quot;war&quot; chalked up a staggering 2,800 extra-judicial killings of suspected drug users in just three months. An investigation in 2007 found that most of the killings were carried out by the police and were not &quot;shoot-outs&quot; or &quot;self-defence&quot; as claimed by the authorities. Human rights activists were abused by the authorities as being soft on drug dealers. Thaksin point-blank refused to permit an international investigation from the UN commission for human rights in Geneva. Extra-judicial killings by the police are illegal under Thai law and of course under international law. Police squads using emergency powers become judge, jury and executioner. People totally unconnected with drug-taking can easily end up on a list of suspects. Former Thai senator Jon Ungaporn wrote in the Bangkok Post: &quot;In the end, the war on drugs was simply a populist killing spree of small fry. No big drug dealers were ever affected, and after a while the drug business returned to normal.&quot; You would expect any new government would be anxious to avoid a repeat performance. Not a bit of it. It&apos;s happening here in Thailand all over again under the leadership of newly appointed rightwing prime minister Samak Sundaravej, remembered by many for his alleged role in the bloody Thammasat University massacre in 1976. On February 20, the interior minister, Chalerm Yubamrung, told the Thai parliament that: &quot;for drug dealers, if they do not want to die, they had better quit staying on that road.

That has to be done.&quot; In China they execute drug dealers after a brief appearance in court. The Thai anti-drug warriors have found a shortcut, dispensing with any court appearance at all. On April 2 the war on drugs was relaunched to protests from Thai NGOs, human rights groups and opposition MPs from the Democrat party. Thailand is not some remote dictatorship cut off from international communications. It is a major economy, the world&apos;s leading rice exporter and an important trading partner with western countries. Yet so far there has been little international outcry at this return to the judicial dark ages. The UK embassy in Bangkok is no doubt too busy with its commercial ties and with expanding British investment. Human Rights Watch has issued a report but no government has expressed any concern. The UN office on drugs and crime (Undoc) has already bought into a US-driven &quot;war against drugs&quot;. During the 2003 killing spree Undoc in Bangkok reportedly stayed silent while drug enforcement took a brutal turn. It was only the UN human rights commission in Geneva that took any action and expressed alarm. Will UN drug enforcers and the Bangkok embassies stay silent again if the same murderous mayhem grips the country? The Thai government crackdown on drugs flies in the face of a special UNAids report that calls on Asian governments to abandon their counterproductive &quot;war on drugs&quot; programmes and adopt public health priorities including a strong harm reduction strategy to prevent the spread of HIV among injecting heroin users. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, and UNAids&apos; director Peter Piot, have supported calls in the report for Asian governments to amend outdated laws criminalising injecting drug users and other stigmatised groups, instead of driving them underground. Not only Thailand but many countries are on a collision course between public health priorities and HIV prevention on the one hand and zealous law enforcement and punishment of drug users on the other. Drug wars are all about the opportunism of political leaders pandering to and fuelling a dark hysteria and ignorance about narcotics. There will never be any quick-fix solutions. Many innocent lives could be saved if UN agencies and governments deliver a strong message that one &quot;war on drugs&quot; disaster is more than enough.", "publicationDate": "2008-04-18T07:00:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Human rights", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/18/notanotherwarondrugs", "title": "Not another war on drugs", "sentences": ["Former Thai senator Jon Ungaporn wrote in the Bangkok Post: &quot;In the end, the war on drugs was simply a populist killing spree of small fry.", "The UK embassy in Bangkok is no doubt too busy with its commercial ties and with expanding British investment.", "During the 2003 killing spree Undoc in Bangkok reportedly stayed silent while drug enforcement took a brutal turn.", "Will UN drug enforcers and the Bangkok embassies stay silent again if the same murderous mayhem grips the country?"]}, {"article": "Fresh Tibetan protests have broken out in Qinghai, western China, despite the heavy security presence, residents and activist groups said yesterday.  The groups said police had beaten and detained monks and others who were calling for the release of protesters held after demonstrations last month.  The Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy - based in north India, at the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile - claimed that more than 100 lamas, and others from Tongren (also known as Rebkong), were detained on Thursday.  Tongren hotel staff confirmed that a demonstration had taken place.  &quot;Today there&apos;s no more protests. Those people were all seized,&quot; one receptionist said.  A woman at another hotel put the number of protesters in the dozens and said that police had imposed a curfew.  One Tibetan restaurant worker said the police had randomly beaten people and that the monastery was now sealed off.  Protests are thought to have broken out in Tongren in February, a month before the riots in Lhasa. They reignited on March 16 as protests spread across Tibetan areas following the actions of about 100 monks who climbed a hillside above the monastery, burned incense and set off fireworks, while riot police assembled outside.  Around half of China&apos;s six million Tibetans live outside the Tibetan Autonomous Region, many in Tongren. Yesterday, Yasuo Fukuda, Japan&apos;s prime minister, urged the Chinese foreign minister, Yang Jiechi - who was on a visit to Tokyo - to start a dialogue with Tibetans and to be more open about the crackdown. Yang said Tibet was a domestic matter. A major Japanese Buddhist temple also withdrew from hosting the Olympic torch relay next week, citing both safety concerns and sympathy. One of its officials, Shinsho Wakaomi, told a press conference: &quot;Zenkoji is a Buddhist temple. Naturally, we are concerned about Tibet.&quot; Around 2,000 police officers will guard the flame as it travels through Bangkok today. Police vans will also travel alongside in case the torch carriers need to jump inside for safety. Samak Sundaravej, the prime minister, said protesters had no reason to disrupt the relay.

Whichever way to look at it, Eriksson can reflect on a hugely satisfying day as he attempts to show his trigger-happy employer that he deserves better than to be paid off in the summer. Eriksson&apos;s only source of frustration might have been that Thaksin cancelled plans to attend and decided instead to stay in Bangkok, where he is preparing for a trial on corruption charges. The former Thai prime minister wants open and expansive football and there was even a backdrop of &quot;Ol\u00e9s&quot; as his wish was granted, albeit against a Portsmouth side that contributed heavily to their own downfall. Harry Redknapp, the Portsmouth manager, will certainly want a vast improvement from his players if they are to extinguish Cardiff City&apos;s hopes in next month&apos;s FA Cup final. His team were two behind after 13 minutes and on both occasions the defending could be described as, at best, generous. Hermann Hreidarsson then got himself sent off after John Utaka&apos;s 24th-minute goal had thrown up the possibility of a comeback and, after that, City had so much space to exploit it was a surprise they had to wait so long before Benjani Mwaruwari settled the contest with 16 minutes to go. By that stage the City fans had made their feelings clear, bellowing Eriksson&apos;s name in what felt like a massed plea for Thaksin to apply some leniency. Presumably, Thaksin will see and hear more of the same when he takes his seat for City&apos;s game against Fulham on Saturday. Whether it will sway him remains to be seen, having confirmed he will &quot;evaluate&quot; Eriksson&apos;s position at the end of the season. Eriksson is, however, entitled to point out that his side have now accumulated their highest-ever amount of points in a 38-game Premier League season. Another three points from their remaining three games and they will have surpassed their best over 42 games, from the 1992-93 season. This victory was particularly impressive given that Eriksson had eight defenders unavailable through injury or illness and so deployed Elano, an attacking midfielder, at right-back. Richard Dunne joined the list of casualties early in the second half when he came off with a hamstring strain, to be replaced by an academy graduate, Sam Williamson. Yet City, for the most part, defended robustly, in particular when compared with some of the farcical goings-on in the opposition back-line. The opening goal set the tone, Sol Campbell and David James leaving the ball to one another, encouraging Benjani to nip in between them. With the net hopelessly exposed, the ball was laid back for Stephen Ireland, who miscued his shot but succeeded in setting up Darius Vassell at the far post. The inquest was still going on in the Portsmouth defence when, two minutes later, City went further ahead and, again, Campbell will grimace when he sees the replays. This time Elano&apos;s cross went through a congested penalty area to Martin Petrov. The Bulgarian was on his weaker right foot and tried what, in the vernacular of the playground, used to be known as the &quot;toe-poke&quot;, the ball flicking off the inside of Campbell&apos;s leg to beat James again. Portsmouth&apos;s response was initially impressive, Utaka capitalising on some hesitant goalkeeping from Joe Hart to hook in Jermain Defoe&apos;s header. A comeback was conceivable but then Ireland released Vassell and Hreidarsson grappled his arm around the striker to impede his run. Whether Vassell would have got to the ball ahead of James is dubious, but the referee Andre Marriner was correct in rating it a professional foul. The pace of the first half was breathless and it barely slowed after the break, with both sides creating chances and committed to attack. The difference was that Portsmouth&apos;s defence was strangely out of sorts, in particular Campbell and the hapless Sylvain Distin, who seemed more intent on winding up the home supporters than doing his normal job. The former City defender, harangued throughout as a mercenary, allowed Benjani to give him the slip far too easily for the final goal. And within 30 second Eriksson&apos;s name was being serenaded again.

Jit Siratranont, 56, the former Thai MP accused of criminal libel, could face up to two years in prison and a fine of \u00a316.4m after he made a speech at Bangkok&apos;s Kasetsart University saying Tesco Lotus&apos;s expansion was &quot;aggressive&quot;. Siratranont, now vice-general secretary of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, was served with writs for criminal defamation and civil libel last November after he made comments saying the expansion was at the expense of small retailers who could not compete with Tesco Lotus&apos;s 370 superstores and hypermarkets across the country. Kamol Kamoltrakul, 57, an academic and writer at Bangkok Business News, is facing a \u00a31.6m damages claim after being served with a libel writ. Like Jit, he had criticised Tesco Lotus&apos;s expansion in Thailand, and both also said the company had sought to minimise its Thai tax liabilities. In the speech Jit said that Tesco Lotus contributed 37% of the company&apos;s global revenues, which is incorrect. Kamol also made this error last October. Both have since admitted the mistake but said they intend to challenge the libel claims. In a third case, Nongnart Harnvilai, 45, a writer for Bangkok Business News, wrote about Tesco Lotus&apos;s plans to open a further 130 outlets, saying Thai competitors were in for a difficult time.  The short piece ended with the phrase: &quot;Ha, Tesco Lotus doesn&apos;t love Thais.&quot; Tesco Lotus claimed she had damaged the company&apos;s reputation. Bangkok Business News is supporting both journalists and has said it will fight the actions.

The threat from western superstore chains to Thailand&apos;s thousands of &quot;mom-and-pop&quot; retailers has been a controversial issue there for the past seven years. His own English translation of his article, which he hands over, does not read in a particularly inflammatory style. It does contain a mistake: Kamol says: &quot;The shocking truth is that 37% of [Tesco&apos;s] income comes from Thailand.&quot; And he goes on to make the case that Tesco&apos;s Thai profits are mostly returned to the UK &quot;because of the complexity of accounting which can deduct a lot of expenses and show low profit&quot;. Kamol now says the 37% figure was a slip based on a misreading of figures and the correct number is more like 3.7%. But on the more general point, that Tesco ships profits out of Thailand, he claims: &quot;I think I&apos;m right.&quot; An economist by training, he says the limited information in the company&apos;s local financial reports suggests, for example, that they pay hefty royalties to their parent for use of the Tesco name. Tesco said yesterday that royalties were charged by Tesco Stores Ltd to its Thai operations and to other foreign operations &quot;for the provision of know-how and the use of brand and trademarks&quot;. This was described as &quot;perfectly normal practice&quot; in compliance with all relevant tax laws and agreed with both UK and Thai tax authorities. Kamol&apos;s main theme in his piece was that there should be regulations in Thailand, as in other south-east Asian countries, &quot;to control the expansion of foreign-owned retail superstores in order to protect small local retailers&quot;. That contention would not be regarded as unusual in Britain, where numerous local campaigns against Tesco expansion are based on just such complaints. Indeed, Britain has an anti-Tesco website, Tescopoly.com, and a campaigning book, Tescopoly: How One Shop Came Out on Top, by Andrew Simms. Nor do Kamol and his fellow campaigners claim to be more than a relatively powerless minority. &quot;Tesco have the upper hand in Thailand. Many consumers support them because they think it&apos;s convenient to shop in Tesco, and the fresh food markets are out-of-date and old-fashioned.&quot; Kamol is a prolific writer and researcher. He has worked as an adviser to the Thai ministry of the interior. He writes for several newspapers and is a government adviser on banking and finance and visiting lecturer at three universities. Tesco says it launched lawsuits against Kamol and two other individuals because it &quot;felt we had no choice after a sustained campaign of misinformation&quot;. Kamol says the libel writs did not arrive immediately after his column last October. They came after he addressed a university seminar on behalf of the Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development, a campaigning group. &quot;They want to stop an anti-Tesco movement developing.&quot; Tesco recently issued a libel and &quot;malicious falsehood&quot; writ against the Guardian, following what it said were mistakes in a piece about Tesco tax avoidance practices written by two Guardian journalists.  Campaigners in Britain are lining up to back Kamol and his colleagues, all of whom are being held individually liable under Thai law for any defamations. The free speech group Article 19 said: &quot;We condemn Tesco&apos;s tactic of issuing defamation writs against those who dare to criticise its aggressive expansion plans in Thailand.&quot;  The National Union of Journalists will today call on its 40,000 members to write to the chairman of Tesco and MPs over the libel claims. The NUJ parliamentary group will table a motion condemning the company&apos;s actions. Jeremy Dear, the NUJ general secretary, said: &quot;Tesco&apos;s bid to silence its critics should be vigorously opposed by all those who believe in freedom of expression. The chilling effect of such actions would be to deny the public the right to know about the practices of major corporations.&quot; The International Federation of Journalists supports the NUJ action. IFJ general secretary Aidan White said: &quot;Tesco is displaying an extraordinary amount of intolerance over what is legitimate journalistic scrutiny. It is very high-handed of them to take this approach.&quot; Tesco said yesterday: &quot;Tesco does not have a policy of using legal action to silence its critics. In fact until now we have never had to issue legal proceedings to defend our reputation. The ongoing cases in Thailand and the UK are entirely unrelated. Neither has anything to do with restricting free speech and it would be deeply misleading to suggest they do. The right to free speech does not of course imply the right to defame us.  &quot;In Thailand Tesco Lotus has been seriously defamed in a sustained and malicious campaign over a number of months. In the UK, the Guardian made a series of very damaging allegations relating to Tesco&apos;s tax affairs despite our clear indications to the paper in advance that these were utterly false and that we would defend our reputation if necessary. The Guardian was given the opportunity to retract the allegations but chose not to do so. &quot;In both cases we have been left no option other than to take legal action - a step we would not consider unless we believed it was entirely justified. We still hope the matters can be resolved by agreement, but if not we will have to resort to the courts to restore our reputation.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-04-22T06:16:42Z", "tags": ["Tesco", "Supermarkets", "Business", "Thailand", "Human rights", "World news", "Newspapers & magazines", "Media", "Freedom of speech", "Censorship", "Law", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/apr/22/tesco.supermarkets", "title": "They want to stop protests, says Thai writer sued by store giant", "sentences": ["&quot;Now, under Thai law, they can seize my house and leave me to live on the street.&quot; Kamol Kamoltrakul wrote one of his monthly columns in a Bangkok business paper last year on Tesco&apos;s aggressive expansion in the south-east Asian state."]}, {"article": "Chefs, restaurateurs and snobbish food lovers are busy abusing language to make cooking and eating seem more mysterious and cultivated than it really is. Photograph: Tim Pannell/Corbis Linguistically, food is a minefield. Or, as many menus would have it, a champ d&apos;explosifs.  All around us, chefs, restaurateurs and snobbish food lovers are busy abusing language, using private code and deploying obscure foreign vocabulary in order to make cooking and eating seem more mysterious and cultivated and justifiably expensive than it really is.  It is time to take a stand ... French letters: Is it Britain&apos;s culinary inferiority complex, simple elitism, or a desperate attempt to inject ordinary food with a little Gallic va va voom, that leads to restaurants, in 2008, using French terms rather than their English equivalents. Even if, as Restaurant Girl reveals, many chefs don&apos;t really know what they mean. It&apos;s the use of words like d\u00e9gustation rather than tasting; en gel&amp;eacute, mi-cuit and rouille; and a tendency to list &quot;boudin noir&quot; instead of &quot;French black pudding&quot;, which scare many ordinary folk off from good restaurants. And it&apos;s jus-t not on. See what I did there? Playing chips: Recently, a menu promised that my chips would arrive in a &quot;Jenga-style stack&quot;. Now, call me jaded, but I&apos;m not particularly impressed that a chef can construct a little cube out of chips. Most five year-olds could. Moreover, what&apos;s next? Kerplunk carrots? Assorted vegetables a la Buckaroo? Gastronaut: We can at least agree that anyone who uses this word in earnest needs shooting, right? You&apos;ve eaten durian fruit in Bangkok. That&apos;s fine. Interesting, in fact. But it&apos;s really not as dangerous as being fired into outer space atop several thousand gallons of rocket fuel, is it? Given that he&apos;s not used the word in print since 2003, come the revolution we may commute Jay Rayner&apos;s death sentence to hard labour. But, still, what was he thinking? Chef&apos;s surprise: Was there a time when it was common practice for chefs to fry stuff in dustbin lids? Or old biscuit tins? I ask, because, otherwise, why am I supposed to be amazed that a chef has chosen to &quot;pan-fry&quot; my sea bass? To be honest, I expect even the thickest kitchen hand to know that if he&apos;s going to fry something, he needs to use a pan. Even I, an amateur, use a frying pan at home. Some would argue that the chef is just being specific. I would argue that I&apos;d be pretty bloody surprised if I was served a deep-fried sea bass fillet in 2008.  Equally, I&apos;m not feeling the added value of &quot;shaved Parmesan&quot; or &quot;tossed salad&quot;. Nor am I bamboozled by the idea that my chicken has been &quot;glazed&quot;, as opposed to covered in sauce, or that certain components of the dish have been twice- and thrice-cooked. Cook that souffl\u00e9 as many times as it takes to make it taste nice, chef. That&apos;s your job.  Foam party: Espuma, cappuccino, air. You mean froth, right? Artistic licence: Is there anything more laughable than chefs - Ferran Adria, that means you - talking about what they do in terms of it being art? I may not know much about art, but I do know that food, by its very nature, is meant to be uplifting. Therefore, if chefs are trying to express themselves through the medium of peas and pork, they&apos;re limiting themselves to a rather narrow emotional range.  NB: As anyone who has ever eaten at a Little Chef can tell you, food can evoke feelings of despair, melancholy and a suffocating sense of your own mortality, but that&apos;s not art, that&apos;s just very bad food. Local, seasonal rubbish: It&apos;s a rare menu these days that doesn&apos;t contain a three-page tribute to the traditional farmers and artisan suppliers who provide chef with his ingredients. But do I care? Certain specific information - for instance, that the beef has been hung for 28 days, or that all the ingredients are sourced within a specific radius - is useful, good advertising and might go some way to justifying an extra couple of quid on the bill. However, telling punters that your spuds come from &quot;Uncle Tom Cobbley&apos;s award winning Cumbrian hill farm&quot; is meaningless hype. I don&apos;t know Uncle Tom, I don&apos;t know how suitable his soil is for growing potatoes, and I don&apos;t know who has given him that award, or why. And, frankly, I&apos;m too hungry to care.  People talk about improvements in British food, but perhaps we will only know we&apos;ve truly reached maturity when we take good ingredients as a given. That we make such a song and dance about every sprout, chop and truckle is, frankly, embarrassing. And finally: Twee, smug and altogether too jolly and middle-class for its own good - but such a convenient shorthand that it&apos;s almost impossible to avoid using it, am I the only, erm, food hobbyist with a vexed relationship with the word foodie? WoM contributor Paul Levy claims to have coined it as a term of abuse. Quite.

But then Terre \u00e0 Terre is not an ordinary vegetarian restaurant. It recently won the prize for the best UK vegetarian restaurant at the 2008 Observer Food Monthly awards, but for my money - and I say this having eaten at many Michelin-starred restaurants and veggie places across the world - this is the best vegetarian food there is. So if you are after mung beans and carrot sticks, look away now. Amanda Powley, Terre \u00e0 Terre&apos;s creative force, does not believe vegetarianism has to mean abstinence. &quot;For me our food is all about indulgence&quot;, she tells me. &quot;It&apos;s not about sacrificing anything, it&apos;s about gaining something.&quot; It&apos;s a philosophy that has served Terre \u00e0 Terre well since it opened in 1993 in tiny premises near Brighton&apos;s sea front. &quot;Back then the catering industry was archaic on so many levels,&quot; says Powley, smiling. &quot;I was a woman, a classically trained chef and a committed vegetarian. I had to start the restaurant - no one else would give me a job!&quot; The opening was very much a homegrown effort. &quot;Literally we got a Readers&apos; Digest DIY book and got our family and friends and we all hung upside down from scaffolding in balaclavas. We put up a sign on the window saying &quot;Opening Sunday!&quot; then crossed it out to add &quot;Monday&quot;, which turned to Tuesday, Wednesday ...&quot; So does she remember her first menu? &quot;Of course: it&apos;s like remembering a bad haircut,&quot; she says. &quot;We had dansak and Bangkok Buddha cakes - they were nice but when I think about how they looked, it&apos;s like remembering some terrible page boy or perm.&quot; Terre \u00e0 Terre quickly became a word-of-mouth success and a move to larger, more commercially viable premises soon followed. Now it is a much-loved staple of the Brighton eating scene - and not just with vegetarians either. Many die-hard steak eaters who have been reluctantly dragged in by friends, firmly believing they&apos;re unlikely to survive an entire mealtime without a hunk of animal, end up becoming regulars. Including Amanda&apos;s dad. &quot;When my parents first came here, he said: &apos;It&apos;s just like a real restaurant without the meat!&apos;&quot; she says. The staff also get more than their fair share of &apos;can I have steak with that?!&apos; comments too, at least initially. &quot;It&apos;s a cliche really that it&apos;s just the men who do that but it&apos;s not,&quot; adds Amanda. &quot;We get equally as many steak jokes from women as with men.&quot; Given it already has a loyal fanbase, how important was the recent Observer award? &quot;It&apos;s brilliant, genuinely we were really very pleased,&quot; she says. &quot;The fact that it&apos;s the customers who voted for it is great, and also the fact that the Observer has acknowledged this specific category. Because in the past we&apos;ve also been a runner-up in the best restaurant category ...&quot; But wouldn&apos;t it have been more satisfying to have won that one - a testament to the fact that the restaurant can more than hold its own against the established names? &quot;Well, yes, we did have that debate, and it is a shame on one level to have a separate category.&quot; She pauses. &quot;And purely on an ego level ... if we could have won that, that would have been even better! But in terms of the bigger picture, I think this is certainly a step in the right direction.&quot; The food at Terre \u00e0 Terre has always tried to change people&apos;s perceptions - flavours and textures are played with in a way that has something in common with Heston Blumenthal&apos;s approach - just without the meat. Interestingly several of Amanda&apos;s chefs (very few of whom have actually been vegetarian) have gone on to work at the Fat Duck, and one is still there. Amanda states her own influences as &quot;anything and everything - I like to make a story with food.&quot; She tells me about a dish she&apos;s been experimenting with at home that morning, trying to make a nice version of a socca - a chickpea pancake her parents used to buy her when they lived in France that she really hated. She says the dish is a disaster - &quot;though it could be a great pudding with different ingredients&quot;. &quot;Really, I just love the playfulness of food. Because it&apos;s about fun,&quot; she adds. It is noticeable eating at Terre \u00e0 Terre that people do seem to be enjoying themselves - there is none of the hushed, sterile reverence of some of the temples of high gastronomy. That, clearly, has never been her aspiration - though surely no chef, however modest, would blanch at awards. &quot;Do you aspire to a Michelin star?&quot; I ask. She laughs. &quot;I don&apos;t think we&apos;d ever get that - I mean of course I&apos;d love it but I think you have to have starched tablecloths and things like that. To be honest, that&apos;s just not our scene.&quot; So where next for Terre \u00e0 Terre? Surely there&apos;s no way it would ever move from Brighton? Amanda deadpans that when they took one popular dish off the menu last year there were &quot;riots on the streets&quot; so heaven knows how the locals would react if the restaurant ever opened a branch in the capital. &quot;We keep dipping our toes in the water with London,&quot; she admits. &quot;We&apos;ve yet to decide really. We&apos;ve got a few wheels in motion - but it&apos;s probably 50-50 at the moment.&quot; In the meantime there is a cookbook in the offing, which Amanda promises will include simpler versions of the restaurant&apos;s favourite dishes as well as some new creations. I&apos;m interested to know Amanda&apos;s own favourite restaurants, but though she cites Providores and the River Cafe as favourites, she finally admits, &quot;You know, I love going out to have bad meals because I come back here and I feel so proud of everybody and everything in here and that we stuck with our guns.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-04-23T23:11:20Z", "tags": ["Life and style", "Food & drink"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/apr/24/foodanddrink.katecarter", "title": "Interview: Amanda Powley, founder of vegetarian restaurant Terre \u00e0 Terre", "sentences": ["&quot;We had dansak and Bangkok Buddha cakes - they were nice but when I think about how they looked, it&apos;s like remembering some terrible page boy or perm.&quot; Terre \u00e0 Terre quickly became a word-of-mouth success and a move to larger, more commercially viable premises soon followed."]}, {"article": " OK, I want to talk about IrelandSpecifically I want to talk about the &quot;famine&quot;About the fact that there never really was oneThere was no &quot;famine&quot;See Irish people were only allowed to eat potatoesAll of the other foodMeat, fish, vegetablesWere shipped out of the country under armed guardTo England while the Irish people starved  Sinead O&apos;Connor, &quot;Famine&quot;, from the Universal Mother album. Since the publication of Susan George&apos;s book How the Other Half Dies and Amartya Sen&apos;s Poverty and Famines it has been widely accepted that hunger is caused not by an absolute lack of food, but the inequities of its distribution. Sen&apos;s widely quoted claim that famines don&apos;t occur in democracies was based on his own experiences of the Bengal famine of 1943 in British ruled-India. It could also have applied to my own family&apos;s stories from Ireland almost a century earlier. Around 2.5 million people died or emigrated during the Great Hunger while food in abundance continued to be exported from Ireland. The famine entered folk memory as symbolising the cruelty and ineptness of English rule. It became a rallying point for future generations of physical force separatists and created a diaspora, particularly in America, who were prepared to support them, with money and guns. A few weeks ago I attended a seminar at the UN World Food Programme&apos;s (WFP) regional headquarters in Bangkok. A number of heads of mission from the Asian regional programmes were there and all had similar stories to tell about the devastating effects that the current worldwide rise in food prices is causing. WFP in Afghanistan has already started an emergency distribution programme for 2.5 million people. The Asian Development Bank estimates that 300 million people are at risk in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Everyone that I spoke to said it was the worst crisis that any of them have ever seen. Food riots have already forced the resignation of Haiti&apos;s prime minister and led to severe clashes in Bangladesh and Egypt. An Afghan friend told me that the price hike has effectively wiped out the entire value of the western aid that the country has received over the last few years. The most immediate cause of the price rise has been the sudden decision by many farmers to switch production to growing cereals which can be converted to biofuels, prompted by new western laws and subsidies. As the World Bank points out, the grain required to fill the tank of a sports utility vehicle with ethanol could feed one person in a poor country for a year. It is not hard to imagine how that is going to be perceived by much of the world&apos;s population; just amend the words to Sinead O&apos;Connor&apos;s song. George Bush has defended his policy of biofuel subsidies as being necessary to safeguard future US energy supplies and this policy could turn out to be even more damaging to his global standing than the invasion of Iraq. But, as George Monbiot points out, biofuels are only part of the picture. Last year there was a record grain harvest of over 2bn tonnes. The production of biofuels consumed 100m tonnes of this, while almost 800m went to feed livestock for meat production. Monbiot links this to rising population numbers and goes on to suggest that we should all become vegan, or at least dramatically cut down on eating meat to &quot;sustainable levels&quot; that our planet can support. However, this rather misses the point of the current debate. As Monbiot himself notes, levels of meat consumption have barely changed in Britain over the last few decades but they are booming in Asia and Latin America. This is not primarily because of rising population levels, but because of income growth. More people are eating meat because they can afford it - and because it tastes nicer. A recent survey showed that 23 million people had joined the ranks of the Brazilian middle class in the last two years alone, and a similar story can be told about India and China. Increases in income levels do lead to increased consumption, but they also tend to lead to lower birth rates, over time, and so the embourgeoisement of part of the planet contains some self-stabilising mechanisms. The current food price hike also reverses a 30-year trend of falling prices, which has had a devastating impact on the lives of small farmers. Most of the world&apos;s poor live in rural areas and so a gradual increase in prices is actually good news for them. In the longer term it could make it economic to bring more land under cultivation and provide a boost in exports for some poor countries. Africa currently has less commercial agriculture than it did 50 years ago and, as everyone who has ever visited the continent knows, there is a huge amount of fertile land that is currently lying fallow. Agriculture is one of the few economic sectors where developing countries could compete with the rich world on equal terms, but tariffs and subsidy regimes have blocked their exports. Rich countries currently spend about 10 times more subsidising their own farmers than they give to the poorest countries in aid, and the average EU cow receives more financial support than half the world&apos;s population has to live on. Some of this aid actually consists of food surpluses that are shipped across the world at great expense and then dumped on poor countries, where they price local farmers out of the market. The root cause of the current instability of the world&apos;s food markets is directly related to the long-term distorting effect these subsidies have created. This is not to deny that the rise in the world&apos;s population has serious long-term consequences, but addressing the problem in the short and medium term will require different measures. Oxfam&apos;s Barbara Stocking has already called for urgent help both to tide over those most badly affected by the price hikes and to boost investment in small-scale agriculture and infrastructure improvements in poor countries. The Economist agrees and points out that helping small-scale farmers to increase production would be more economically efficient, due to the law of diminishing returns, as well as socially just and environmentally-friendly. It is rare for there to be such a consensus on what needs to be done. Tackling the vested interests of agribusiness, interests that have created the rich world&apos;s crazy system of subsidies and tariffs, will, however, be a huge task and is sometimes compared to the 19th century movement to repeal the Corn Laws. It was the devastating fallout from the Irish famine that finally convinced the British government of the necessity of this measure. Perhaps the current food crisis will have a similar impact. Finally, the Bush administration might also like to consider the cost-benefit ratio of its biofuels programme a little more carefully and reflect on the role of the Irish and Indian famines on the ultimate downfall of the British empire.", "publicationDate": "2008-04-25T10:00:00Z", "tags": ["Global development", "Biofuels", "Agriculture", "Hunger"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/25/avoidablehunger", "title": "Avoidable hunger", "sentences": ["A few weeks ago I attended a seminar at the UN World Food Programme&apos;s (WFP) regional headquarters in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Morocco St Pancras to Morocco is an overland adventure that takes just 48 hours.

Eriksson had resigned himself to being sacked after City&apos;s final two games of the season but Thaksin&apos;s son, Panthongtae, said the former England head coach would remain in charge for a game in Bangkok on May 17 against a Thailand Premier All-Stars team. Panthongtae, a City director, also told journalists in Thailand that Eriksson would manage the team against a South China Invitational XI in Hong Kong five days later. Thaksin&apos;s thinking is that City are unlikely to have a new manager in place, with their first target, Luiz Felipe Scolari, contracted to the Portuguese football federation until after the European Championship. However, it throws up the possibility of Eriksson, who is refusing to resign because it would compromise his \u00a31m payoff, being expected to carry on as normal even though Thaksin and his elaborate network of contacts have begun the process of trying to persuade Scolari to move to England. It is a measure of how Thaksin likes to work that he has decided to change managers even though he knows that the club&apos;s chief executive, Alistair Mackintosh, the deputy chairman, John Wardle, and the director Bryan Bodek all support Eriksson. Mackintosh travelled to London on Tuesday to try to dissuade Thaksin from his plan, but to no avail, and the episode is threatening to drive a wedge between the English and Thai representatives on the City board. Thaksin, by his own admission, is new to football and learning about the game and, to the frustration of those with far greater experience, the same could be said of the people he brought with him. After his \u00a380m takeover last summer Thaksin appointed as directors his son Panthongtae, his daughter Pintongta and Sasin Monvoisin, the wife of the former Thai ambassador, Vikrom Koompirochana. He also brought in an old associate, Taweesuk Jack Srisumrid, to monitor the working performances of the club&apos;s employees and Taweesuk, in particular, has struggled to make a favourable impression. Established figures at the club were embarrassed, moreover, to see Monvoisin collecting autographs outside the away dressing room after Chelsea&apos;s recent game at the City of Manchester stadium. Croatia&apos;s coach, Slaven Bilic, will sign a contract extension on Monday, according to the Croatian football federation.

Last summer, when the Swede sought reassurance, it was to the Premier League chairman - and noted expert in south-east Asian politics - that he turned for an appraisal of the former Thai prime minister&apos;s record. &quot;It was enough for me to make a phone call to Sir Dave Richards,&quot; Eriksson explained recently. &quot;He [replied]: &apos;Absolutely clean&apos;.&quot; Alas, Thaksin is now facing corruption and fraud charges back in Thailand and - despite opening the case for the defence by parading Kasper Schmeichel around Bangkok - is bailed till his court date in August. Obviously, it is a positive that Eriksson looks likely to be sacked, as opposed to disappeared, as Amnesty alleges has been the fate of others who have displeased Thaksin&apos;s administrations in the past. But could this have been foreseen? Instead of spending the close season coming up with a revised plan to sell Game 39 to us, perhaps the Premier League might consider overhauling the &quot;fit and proper person&quot; test, by which potential club owners and directors are judged. At present, the form is shorter than the one you would be required to fill in if you were off to Florida for a week. It is not quite the most fatuous form in circulation - that honour is held by the UK immigration document which inquires of visitors: &quot;Have you ever been involved in the financing, planning, preparation, commission or attempted commission of terrorist acts or in supporting acts of terrorism either within or outside the UK...?&quot; Then again, the immigration form also asks: &quot;Have you engaged in any other activities which might be relevant to the question of whether you are a person of good character?&quot; Even though that would appear to invite the most withering sarcasm, there is something regrettable about the fact that the Premier League test doesn&apos;t include such a question. It would at least have shown willing. Under the present, rigorous standards, Kim Jong-il would be judged fit and proper. He hasn&apos;t evaded VAT, you see, or been done for forgery. One can&apos;t help feeling the test is failing to keep pace with the sort of chaps who are increasingly keen to annex a piece of English football. In an age when it is widely assumed that foreign speculators see clubs as political tools - let&apos;s call it the football industrial complex - asking about VAT feels somewhat quaint. Perhaps extra questions might be added. Are you an asset stripper? Do you intend to use your purchase as a means of laundering your reputation? Do you expect your involvement to increase or allay the club&apos;s debt? Are you seriously going to trot out that line about not being in it to make huge profit, just being infected with a lifelong passion for the club? Have you recently hollowed out a volcanic island to which you expect to semi-retire in the company of, say, a white cat?  Or how about &quot;Are you a foreign government?&quot; Because that seems kind of weird. Don&apos;t forget that Thaksin attempted to buy Liverpool with public money while he was actually Thai PM, while the Kop&apos;s latest suitors are the investment arm of the Dubai government. Still, it&apos;s not all change: for his part in both situations, Rick Parry remains the poster boy for clubs&apos; grasping naivety. So who is persona non grata? No one has ever been banned from Premier League involvement and, as covered by David Conn last week, the only person disqualified under the Football League&apos;s test is the Rotherham chairman, Denis Coleman - a lifelong fan who inherited appalling finances but is barred because Rotherham&apos;s current insolvency is his second, the club being previously in administration while he was a director. Explaining last month why a notorious asset stripper would be permitted to buy Mansfield, the Football League stated: &quot;In order to make the test meaningful and workable it has to be based on clear objective criteria rather than a subjective judgment of someone&apos;s suitability.&quot; And yet, there is more than one way to appease company law. The regulation must become more sophisticated. The record of owners must be examined by a range of experts, not by &quot;football men&quot; with chequered histories of their own who require only the completion of a flimsy form to conclude &quot;He&apos;s clean&quot;.

A delegation of senior players - led, it is understood, by the captain Richard Dunne - approached Eriksson earlier this week and offered to put their names to a public statement expressing strong misgivings about Thaksin&apos;s ruthlessness and accusing the former prime minister of Thailand of making a grave mistake. As a Manchester Evening News poll reported that 97% of City&apos;s fans were against Thaksin&apos;s treatment of Eriksson, it has also become apparent that Dunne is so aggrieved by the current chaos that he is thinking of leaving the club this summer and that the backlash extends to the boardroom, where the chief executive, Alistair Mackintosh, and deputy chairman, John Wardle, both sympathise with the former England head coach. While Mackintosh and Wardle reluctantly accept that they are powerless to prevent Thaksin from changing his mind, the mood among the players is so rebellious that they have held a lengthy meeting to discuss ways of offering a public show of support for Eriksson.  In the heat of the moment the players discussed effectively going on strike in a move that will evoke memories of Eriksson&apos;s time as England manager, when the Football Association withdrew Rio Ferdinand from a Euro 2004 qualifier in Turkey because he had missed a drugs test. On that occasion the other England players threatened to down tools before being talked out of being so militant. The idea put forward by City&apos;s players involved embarrassing Thaksin in his native country by refusing to take part in a game against a Thailand Premier All-Stars team on May 17, as well as a match in Hong Kong against a South China Invitational XI five days later. The players, who are due to leave on May 14 and perform a series of promotional duties such as opening a new club shop, asked Eriksson what he thought about them putting together a letter in which they would refuse to travel without him in charge. Though grateful, Eriksson was against the idea, believing it compromised the players&apos; own positions and would do no good anyway. Since then it has emerged that, farcically, Eriksson might still be in charge of the tour anyway, for no other reason than Thaksin does not believe he will have a new manager in place, his first choice, Luiz Felipe Scolari, being contracted to the Portuguese football federation until the end of the European Championship. The players, meanwhile, are still staunchly behind Eriksson but have accepted that they should not do anything that breaches their own contracts. Nonetheless, it is likely they will be far more reluctant to satisfy Thaksin&apos;s requirements than they have been in the past, most recently when Joe Hart and Darius Vassell were asked to record a video message saying how much they were looking forward to visiting Thailand. The clips were shown at a press conference to promote the event in Bangkok on Wednesday. It is also clear that whoever replaces Eriksson will have his work cut out winning over a group of players who are so united behind the current manager and that it is quite conceivable Dunne will have left the club. The Republic of Ireland international has only a year left on his contract and, though he has strong emotional ties with City, he is said to be closer than any other player to Eriksson and disillusioned about the direction in which the club are going. More immediately Eriksson takes his team to Liverpool on Sunday for his penultimate match in charge. City&apos;s supporters are planning a protest but Thaksin is not expected to attend as he prepares for his trial in Thailand on corruption charges. Eriksson will certainly have plenty to talk about with Rafael Ben\u00edtez if the conversation gets around to their clubs&apos; owners but City are reluctant for the Swede to talk publicly, cancelling his weekly press briefing today &quot;due to exceptional circumstances&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2008-05-02T02:10:40Z", "tags": ["Manchester City", "Football", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/may/02/manchestercity.premierleague", "title": "Eriksson talks City players out of strike", "sentences": ["The clips were shown at a press conference to promote the event in Bangkok on Wednesday."]}, {"article": "We were sitting on the floor of a house in Ja Bor in north west Thailand, a three-hour drive from Chang Mai on a road of endless hairpin bends, talking to village women about their traditional black coats. A supper of wild eggplant, pumpkin, pork, chilli paste, rice, omelette and sweet tea had been cleared away and these mountain people of the Lahu tribal group were explaining about the coloured stripes on their coat sleeves. The colours, they said, were based on what we had eaten: red for the sharp-faced pigs which rootled around underneath stilted wooden homes; yellow for tea; white for rice and blue for vegetables. The women asked if I would like to try on one of these home-crafted, open-fronted garments, edged in white with elegant slits up the side. The coat felt cosy in the cool night air but it must be stifling during the heat of the day. &quot;Yes, its hot,&quot; they said. &quot;We wear our black trousers all the time but not the coat.&quot; Earlier in the day, we had gone on a hike along dusty paths and among craggy mountains, escorted by villagers (the women in their coats) and a small boy in an orange T-shirt. Here, tucked into valley basins are fields of rice, maize, vegetables and a flourishing pig farm \u2013 further connections with those coats of many colours. Stopping to take in the quilted shapes of the rice fields, swaying bamboos and deciduous forests, we sat on a rough wooden bench. We learn it was made by a villager as a small penalty for not producing enough crops for the community. A more ancient resting place is revealed in a hidden cave. It&apos;s a dizzying climb up a wooden ladder built into a cliff to see a bunch of coffins placed in limestone orifices. The mysterious remnants of an unknown people, these boat-like wooden coffins resting on stilts date back some 1,500 years. Limestone coffin caves are a feature of tourism in this part of Thailand but this one, high above ground rather than below it, is most unusual. The Lahus, like the Karen and other hill tribes of northern Thailand, are newcomers to tourism to the demands of inviting strangers not only to poke around their environment but also to stay in their homes. They are vulnerable to the sort of tourism that objectifies and exploits them. But the villagers of Ja Bor are developing a tourism that they control and manage and profit from. Our local guide, Ja Yor, dressed in a loose, black satiny jacket and the sort of low, crotch-slung trousers that British teenagers would die for, said that &quot;tourists can see our agriculture, and this is a way of reminding our young people that we have a good life here.&quot; Tourism has also inspired him to research his own culture: it has made him confident, and has given the village a new pride in their identity. Some hundred miles to the south, in the villages of Mae Klang Luang and Pha Mon, a similar process is taking place. These two Karen villages lie inside the Doi Inthanon national park. Once this area suffered from excessive opium poppy growing and deforestation while the tourists who came never spent any money in the villages. But, as in Ja Bor, community-based tourism has brought hope not hindrance. Somsak Khiriphumtong, the inspirational co-ordinator from Mae Klang Luang, believes that tourism can help sustain the forests as well as bring income to the village as they wont have to resort to felling trees for sale. Visitors to Mae Klang Luang stay in a local home mattresses on the floor with outside washing facilities or in a large dormitory-style building, and are fed lavish amounts of food from the villages ubiquitous rice fields, its fish farm, organic vegetable garden and from the nearby forest, nurtured by sparkling streams. Close to a waterfall is a delicate bamboo shrine to thank the spirits for carrying water to the rice fields. And then there is coffee production. Dried by the sun, roasted over an open fire and sifted on bamboo platters, this arabica coffee bears a Fairtrade label and gets sold to Starbucks. Of the 64 houses in the village, three-quarters now have some stake in tourism. Somsak said that he had to tell the community that &quot;you have to wait for fruit to grow before you harvest it and tourism is like that. Now they are much happier. We sell our local way of life but we don&apos;t lose anything.&quot; Indeed, this innovative man has opened a small museum to conserve old village tools and household equipment, such as terracotta pots, and bamboo mugs now replaced by plastic. This is a remote world despite mobile phones and electricity where outsiders can gain a taste of life in unknown rural Thailand which is about as close to an &quot;authentic experience&quot; of someone else&apos;s culture as is possible for anyone who is not Thai. There is still a sense that the encounter between host and guest is fresh and intriguing. The challenge will be maintaining it. Many of these villagers have seen what happens when tourism occurs without proper planning and consultation. Surasith Donjaiphaiwan, a young man with spiky hair and a big grin, used to work as a guide. &quot;Tour operators weren&apos;t friendly,&quot; he said. &quot;The tourists were drunk, asked for drugs and had no respect.&quot; He has returned to his nearby village, Pha Mon, to help develop tourism, and the &quot;Bamboo Pink House&quot; is one result. Built by the community, the lipstick-coloured wooden building sits above a sweep of rice fields and provides accommodation for six people, visitors who find enjoyment trekking in the forests where every leaf seems to have a purpose, for food, religion or health or exploring the pattern of village life. This has not happened by accident. A Thai NGO called the Community-Based Tourism Institute (CBTI) has spent many years working in villages such as Ja Bor, Mae Klang Luang and Pha Mon. Forty Thai villages from the far north to mangrove fishing villages in the south have been involved. &quot;We want tourism to contribute positively for people and the environment,&quot; said Peter Richards of CBTI. &quot;We see tourism as a tool for development. But we need to allow space for the small players in tourism to grow.&quot; Richards is CBTI&apos;s co-ordinator of a radical initiative that recently brought together villagers from nine Thai communities along with the same number of Thai and UK tour operators, all carefully chosen for their sensitive tourism practices. It was a pioneering exploration of how these three strands could work together to attract &quot;responsible&quot; tourists to rural Thailand. CBTI&apos;s work is an important counterpoint to Thailand&apos;s voracious tourism development dating from the Vietnam war when GIs went there for RR which has eaten into communities with no thought of sustainability. Those, such as the hill-tribes with their distinctive traditions, are most likely to be its victims. And perhaps its most abusive form is found close to the Burmese border an hours drive from Ja Bor. There, Burmese refugees have long languished inside camps. Outside, women of the Kayan tribal group, also refugees from Burma but of economic value to the tourist industry, are on parade: for the many brass collars they wear around their neck from childhood give the impression of unusual elongation. So they pose for photographs and sell dismal souvenirs that they do not make (apart from some woven cloth) and receive a pitiful wage while others benefit from the money (about 5) that each tourist has to pay to visit them. The opposite of that unequal relationship is what community-based tourism is all about with guests and hosts gaining mutual benefits. But making it all work is difficult. The community leaders are anxious for the tour operators to send the right sort of tourists. The tour operators will do their best explaining to their clients what to expect but as CBTI&apos;s Peter Richards explains, &quot;Tour operators can&apos;t choose their clients they can&apos;t make them fill in a three-page application form.&quot; And what do the tour operators want from the communities? Don&apos;t change yourselves for us was the message. &quot;Our guests are looking to discover your way of life, not a prefab addition or one that you think they might want. They could go to a theme park for that,&quot; said Christopher Gow of Symbiosis Expedition Planning, one of the UK tour operators present at the meeting. Or, as Lesley Schofield, from Gecko Travel, put it, &quot;They don&apos;t want just to observe your life, they want to live your life for a day.&quot; And that is what the communities have learned that their culture is important. As one community member from Koh Yao Noi, an island in the south of Thailand, said: &quot;The sea is normal to us but interesting to tourists. Taking visitors fishing makes us see things differently. Our tourism is not what you get from a hotel, but our service is from the heart.&quot; Way to go Getting there Emirates (0870 2432222, emirates.com) to Bangkok via Dubai from six UK airports from \u00a3550 return, including tax.

How to pick a community tourism holiday Community-based tourism is rural tourism managed and operated by local community groups, so income from holidaymakers benefits them directly, reinforces a sense of cultural identity and provides opportunities for sustainable development.  There is no equivalent to a Fairtrade mark for the travel industry, so use this checklist. \u00b7 Check the website for prominence of some kind of mission statement about their ideas on ethical/responsible tourism. \u00b7 Ask your tour operator whether they include community-based tourism in their itineraries and how the communities you plan to visit specifically benefit from tourism. Communities should be fairly paid (not easy to assess) and should be pocketing all of the profits from their input, such as homestays, unless they are in partnership with a local entrepreneur such as a lodge-owner, when profits will be shared.  \u00b7 If you choose to take a community-based tour, ask the tour operator if it will be possible to visit village projects funded by tourism - it might be equipping a school, repairing a health clinic, reforestation, an organic vegetable farm, or even a waste disposal system - but it&apos;s fun and interesting to see where some of your money is going. \u00b7 Stay clear of holidays which emphasise &quot;ecotourism&quot; - this has become a debased word. Instead, focus on operators who have a social responsibility emphasis. \u00b7 Tour operators who include community-based tourism in their brochures should have the communities at heart. Once you get there, signs to look out for that all is not well might be the presence of too many other tourists (community-based tourism is about quality not quantity); and outsiders interpreting local life and culture rather than the villagers themselves, even if this is through an interpreter. \u00b7 Find out as much as you can about the community before you book so that you know what to expect in terms of conditions, culture and lifestyle.  \u00b7 When you&apos;re there, make ethical choices like buying local beer and local handicrafts from independent suppliers. by Polly Pattullo The Ethical Travel Guide (Tourism Concern/Earthscan, 2006, \u00a312.99) by Polly Pattullo and Orely Minelli provides a discussion around ethical travel and includes listings of holidays and organisations involved in community tourism.", "publicationDate": "2008-05-03T08:53:39Z", "tags": ["Thailand holidays", "Travel", "Ethical holidays", "Green travel", "Ethical and green living"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/may/03/thailand.community.tourism", "title": "Community Tourism in Thailand", "sentences": ["Our tourism is not what you get from a hotel, but our service is from the heart.&quot; Way to go Getting there Emirates (0870 2432222, emirates.com) to Bangkok via Dubai from six UK airports from \u00a3550 return, including tax.", "Also includes Bangkok, white-water rafting, trekking and a Thai cooking class; \u00a31,400 inc full board, guide and a \u00a350 donation to Ja Bor community; exc flights."]}, {"article": "Burma, once the richest country in southeast Asia, is today mired in deep poverty. Its economy ruined by nearly 50 years of economic mismanagement under military rule, the only international rankings which it tops are those for most corrupt nation, world&apos;s worst health system and lowest spending on education - &quot;accolades&quot; which are sadly indicative of its people&apos;s suffering. Despite this, over the last few years Burma has also emerged as a significant producer of energy in south-east Asia. Thanks to large fields of recoverable natural gas located offshore, Burma now earns substantial foreign-exchange revenues. At present, most of these revenues ($1-1.5 billion per year, depending on price fluctuations) come from Thailand. Gas from Burma, piped onshore from the Gulf of Martaban, generates around 20% of Bangkok&apos;s electricity supply. If all goes well, new gas fields recently discovered in the Bay of Bengal will provide even more gas for China&apos;s Yunnan Province. To get the gas into Yunnan, a much longer pipeline - running the length of Burma - must be built. The project will be as difficult as it will be controversial. Nevertheless, with no environmental or labour standards to contend with, few doubt that the pipeline will proceed. So, given its newfound energy riches, one might expect Burma&apos;s public finances to be rather flush, with surpluses aplenty to spend on health, education and much else that the country so desperately needs. Alas, almost none of Burma&apos;s gas revenues actually feed into its budget, owing to a rather ingenious device employed by the Burmese junta. The device is simple. Like many countries ruled by authoritarian regimes, Burma has a dual exchange-rate system. The official exchange-rate pegs Burma&apos;s currency, the kyat, at a rate of six to one against the US dollar. The informal (or black-market) exchange rate determines the value of the kyat according to supply and demand in the marketplace. Trading kyat in the black market is illegal (and Burma&apos;s regime loves rounding up foreign-exchange dealers from time to time), but it is the only way that people unconnected to the regime can ever hope to come across foreign currency. According to the informal exchange rate, the kyat&apos;s worth is currently about 1,000 to one against the dollar. Given this dual exchange-rate system, hiding Burma&apos;s gas earnings becomes easy. By recording earnings at the official exchange rate, they are worth nearly 200 times below what they should be. Thus, Burma&apos;s gas earnings of around $1.2bn for 2006-07 are rendered into a mere 7.2 billion kyat in the country&apos;s public accounts - less than 1% of the regime&apos;s official public spending. However, recorded at the market exchange rate these earnings translate into 1.2 trillion kyat - an amount large enough to eliminate Burma&apos;s budget deficit, as well as the destructively inflationary money printing which is the regime&apos;s preferred method of public finance. So where do Burma&apos;s generals hide all the money they keep away from the state&apos;s budget? No one but the generals know for sure. However, an inspection of the vaults of the country&apos;s Foreign Trade Bank might be a good place to start, as well as those of some accommodatingly unscrupulous offshore banks. Whatever the precise location of Burma&apos;s riches, these hoards enable the junta to spend at whim. A nuclear reactor, a new capital city, military pay increases - all of these and more have been on the menu of late. The one group that almost certainly will not benefit from any of the largesse are the Burmese people themselves, who are entitled to it and for whom it would mean an end to lives of poverty and want.

In an effort to deflect criticism from a group of leading British authors who labelled Tesco&apos;s tactics &quot;deeply chilling&quot;, Sir Terry Leahy, the global grocer&apos;s chief executive, said in a letter to the Times that Tesco had tried &quot;time and again&quot; to engage with critics of its rapid expansion . But Jit Siratranont, a vice-general secretary of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, who faces two years in jail and a fine of \u00a316.6m, said he had never been contacted except when he appeared in court. Nongnart Harnvilai, a staff columnist for the Bangkok Business News, and Kamol Kamoltrakul, a freelance contributor to the paper, who both face fines of \u00a31.6m and bankruptcy if they lose, also denied that Tesco Lotus - as the firm trades in Thailand - had contacted them or their lawyers seeking a retraction. The trio, who accuse Tesco Lotus of trying to bully them into silence, have become a cause celebre after the writers, including Nick Hornby, Deborah Moggach and Marina Lewycka, expressed concern over the company&apos;s &quot;disproportionate response&quot;. In a statement Tesco said it had sought an agreement with Jit, a former MP, and the two journalists, but in spite of many attempts to get the Thais to set the record straight, they had not done so. In a clarification the company said Tesco Lotus had met representatives of Nongnart and Kamol &quot;in the form of the management of the Nation Group&quot; - owners of Bangkok Business News - twice before the writ was issued and several times afterwards. The chief editor and president had been at one early meeting, Tesco said. Both journalists - who are being sued as individuals, while their newspaper was not named - said that if the matter had been raised in any meetings with the Nation Group management they had not been made aware of it. &quot;No one from Tesco Lotus has ever contacted me or my lawyer to set the record straight or ask for an apology,&quot; said Kamol, 58. &quot;I&apos;ve never heard from them or anything about meetings with the Nation Group until I read their statement.&quot; Thailand&apos;s National Human Rights Commission, which has taken up the three cases in an effort to preserve free speech, said Tesco Lotus&apos;s assertion was a bolt from the blue. &quot;Even after the issue of writ, I did not know of any attempt by Tesco Lotus for an apology ... from Kamol,&quot; wrote Weerawit Weeraworawit, the commission&apos;s deputy general secretary. &quot;In the light of the above, I am dismayed by the apparent disinformation, if not a blatant lie, by a major corporation seemingly advocating good governance and compassion to the public.&quot; Nongnart, 45, whose business gossip column piece about Tesco Lotus&apos;s Thai expansion plans signed off with &quot;Ha, Tesco&apos;s doesn&apos;t love Thais&quot;, had no knowledge of the company&apos;s efforts to contact her or the newspaper. Bangkok Business News editor Duangkamol Chotana, was similarly unaware of any approaches to her managers over the affair. &quot;No one came to me,&quot; she said. &quot;If someone from Tesco Lotus had contacted the management I would naturally expect them to come to me as the editor.&quot; Lawyers for Kamol and Nongnart are due in court in Bangkok to offer their responses to the writs tomorrow. Jit, 56, a rice mill owner in the Thai city of Petchaburi, said: &quot;I have never had any contact with Tesco Lotus at all. I met a representative of the company in court and he confirmed they were suing me and wanted an apology.&quot; Tesco says it did not directly contact Jit but attempted to address him through &quot;media statements, interviews and third parties&quot;. It maintained that in the meetings it did have it was only seeking redress and never wanted to go to court. &quot;At all of these meetings Tesco Lotus made clear that they were primarily looking to restore our reputation,&quot; a spokesman said. &quot;However, the false allegations continued and we were finally forced to resort to legal action.

The Burmese regime, notoriously distrusting of the west, has denied visas to US state department responders seeking to help rebuild after the devastating landfall of Cyclone Nargis on the weekend. Despite that refusal, the White House announced it would send $3m into the country through response teams currently working out of Bangkok. US naval ships and troops also are standing by, awaiting the Burmese regime&apos;s approval to enter the area and assist. &quot;If the unfortunate circumstance comes to pass that our team is not granted the visas in order to get into the area,&quot; White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said, the US would join forces with the UN or other non-governmental agencies able to work within Burma. &quot;But certainly, the relief that Burmese people need would be much better handled if we could get into the country,&quot; Perino added. The $3m comes on top of $250,000 the US pledged yesterday.  The Burmese regime&apos;s insistence on beginning its constitutional referendum vote on Saturday despite the mounting death toll from the cyclone -- now estimated at 22,000 -- has complicated relief efforts. The US Congress is poised to approve a resolution today condemning the constitutional referendum and supporting the Burmese democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi, who remains under house arrest after nearly two decades. &quot;This referendum is a sham, a farce, fake, pretend, bogus, fraudulent, spurious, and phoney,&quot; Democratic congressman Rush Holt, a chief sponsor of the resolution, said.  Amid that outpouring of anger at the abusive regime, some veterans of Burmese politics are raising concerns that criticism from the US could backfire.  &quot;The people are dying. This is no time for a political message to be aired. This is a time for relief,&quot; Burmese analyst Aung Nain Oo told the New York Times. Indeed, early reports from humanitarian groups on the ground indicate a difficulty in confirming whether some aid is actually reaching those affected by the cyclone. Perino, the White House spokeswoman, acknowledged that is a concern in the US. But George Bush did not appear to waver in his administration&apos;s initial approach to the cyclone, one that juggles harsh criticism of the Burmese with a demand that the regime accept US help.  &quot;Our message is to the military rulers: Let the United States come to help you, help the people,&quot; Bush said today as he approved legislation awarding Suu Kyi the congressional gold medal. As he expressed solidarity with the Burmese people in their recovery, Bush added: &quot;[W]e want them to live in a free society.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-05-06T18:28:04Z", "tags": ["US news", "US foreign policy", "George Bush", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "World news", "Cyclone Nargis", "US military", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/06/usa.burma", "title": "US pledges more funds to Burma as regime refuses aid", "sentences": ["Despite that refusal, the White House announced it would send $3m into the country through response teams currently working out of Bangkok."]}, {"article": "     The death toll from the Burmese cyclone today rose above 22,000, with another 41,000 people still missing, as the country&apos;s military regime admitted it was struggling to cope. Hundreds of thousands of people are homeless and without clean water or food. The official death toll has increased throughout the day. Burmese state radio reported that 22,464 people had been confirmed dead. Kyaw Hsan, the information minister, said the regime was &quot;doing its best&quot; to help those afflicted, but that the authorities were finding the relief effort difficult. &quot;The task is very wide and extensive and the government needs the cooperation of the people and well-wishers from at home and abroad,&quot; he said in a news conference in the rubble-strewn former capital, Rangoon, where food and water are running short. &quot;We will not hide anything,&quot; he said, saying \u00a32.2m had been set aside to provide aid. With the price of staple foods, building materials and fuel skyrocketing, he warned retailers against profiteering. &quot;We are coordinating and cooperating with private businessmen. We appeal to the entrepreneurs and businessmen not to cash in on the disaster,&quot; he said. In one town alone, Bogalay in the Irrawaddy delta, the foreign minister, Nyan Win, said 10,000 people had died after it was flattened by the storm surge whipped up by 120mph winds. A spokeswoman for Save the Children said: &quot;It is becoming more and more clear that this is a very serious disaster. Our colleagues out there are comparing it to the level of devastation we saw from the tsunami [in 2004].&quot; The dramatically escalating toll of dead and missing four days after Cyclone Nargis slammed into the south and centre of the country reflects the degree of devastation and remoteness of the worst-affected areas along the coast. The military regime in Burma, known for the brutal repression of its people, has said it would accept international help, and teams of specialists are making their way to the affected areas. Noppadol Pattama, Thailand&apos;s foreign minister, said the Burmese ambassador to Bangkok, Ye Win, told him that 30,000 were missing. Asia&apos;s worst cyclone hit Bangladesh in 1991, killing 143,000. In the delta area to the south and south-west of Rangoon, witnesses described how 16 villages along the coast near another devastated town, Laputta, had simply vanished in the flood surge. Aid agencies have estimated that as many as 1 million people may be without shelter after their flimsy bamboo homes were torn down by the winds or washed away in the flooding that left a carpet of mud when it receded. &quot;We have a major humanitarian catastrophe on our hands,&quot; said Chris Kaye, Burma country director for the UN&apos;s World Food Programme. &quot;The numbers are harrowing. Certainly, we know that in areas in the southern delta - towns like Bogalay and Laputta - were very, very badly affected by the storm surge. A surge in low-lying areas coupled with high winds served to flatten areas, taking villages and villagers with it. It&apos;s a tragic and serious situation,&quot; he said. Rescuers have already begun distributing plastic sheeting for shelter, water purification tablets, mosquito nets, food and cooking utensils. But with little clean water the fear of disease and water-borne illnesses in the tropical climate are now among the agencies&apos; biggest concerns. Thailand, the UN, EU, Japan and India are sending supplies and US first lady Laura Bush said the US was offering \u00a3125,000 of aid and assistance teams were ready to go to help as soon as they were requested. Aid agency World Vision, in Australia, said it had been granted special visas to send in personnel to back up 600 Burmese staff. &quot;This is massive,&quot; said World Vision&apos;s Tim Costello. &quot;Organisations like ours have been given permission, which is pretty unprecedented, to fly people in. This shows how grave it is in the Burmese government&apos;s mind.&quot; The cyclone struck at a time when the regime is under intense international pressure to democratise following the widespread suppression of street protests last year. The ruling junta blamed the protests on foreign interference. A British foreign office minister, Meg Munn, issued a statement saying: &quot;The priority must be to mobilise aid to all those affected to avoid further suffering. We call on the Burmese regime to provide rapid support to its people and to accept international assistance.&quot; The European Union said it would provide \u20ac2m (\u00a31.57m) in urgent humanitarian aid for the cyclone victims. &quot;With every hour that passes, the news coming out of Myanmar [Burma] gets grimmer and grimmer,&quot; said the development commissioner, Louis Michel. &quot;This is a terrible catastrophe that demands a quick and effective humanitarian response.&quot; Residents of Rangoon, including groups of monks, joined forces during the day in an effort to clear the roads of downed trees and telegraph poles. Traffic in the city was described as &quot;horrendous&quot; because most of the roads were reduced to narrow arteries by debris, but at least it afforded an opportunity to get aid to outlying areas.Electricity remained cut off in most of the city, forcing people to queue to buy candles, which, along with other foodstuffs and supplies, have increased in price dramatically. Aid workers were concerned that without access to water people in the city were washing in the lakes, where the supply was already considered a health hazard. &quot;In the city the main problem, absolutely, is water,&quot; said Kirkwood. &quot;In the urban areas, the water is less of a problem. But people without shelter are gathering in schools, monasteries and temples where sanitation is the worry. We&apos;ve examples of 1,000 and 1,500 altogether.&quot; Last night an exiled political prisoners&apos; group said Burmese soldiers and police had killed 36 inmates of Rangoon&apos;s notorious Insein jail after a riot started in the wake of cyclone. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners in Burma said that after the storm had ripped off cell roofs, 1,000 inmates had been herded into a hall and the doors were locked. The prisoners lit a fire inside the hall, but panic ensued when the hall filled with smoke and riot police and soldiers called in to quell the commotion opened fire, killing 36 and wounding 70.

Relief workers who penetrated the worst-hit areas in the rice-growing belt of the Irrawaddy delta south-west of the main city, Rangoon, talked of hundreds of bodies strewn about the paddy fields. The Burmese government identified 15 townships in the Irrawaddy delta that had suffered worst. Seven of them had lost 90 to 95% of their homes with 70% of their population dead or missing.

Food aid has been dispatched but is not clear whether import duties will have to be paid for it and whether the government will insist on controlling its distribution.  The US, which pledged $3m (\u00a31.5m) to UN agencies to help with emergency food distribution, has navy ships in the area which Washington said could be used in the aid distribution effort, but the Burmese government, which accuses the US of fomenting revolt in Burma, is unlikely to allow them to enter its waters. President George Bush appealed yesterday to the junta: &quot;Let the US come and help you.&quot; However, the regime is unlikely to have been impressed by the occasion he used to make the announcement, signing legislation awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to Burmese democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi.  The EU announced it was giving \u20ac2m (\u00a31.5m) to the aid effort, while China said it would give $1m. The authoritarian regime, which has held power for 46 years, did however make one concession. It relented over plans to hold a controversial constitutional referendum on Saturday, which analysts said would cement the generals&apos; hold on power. The government said it would be delayed until May 24 in the worst-hit areas of Rangoon and the Irrawaddy delta. Given the unprecedented scale of the havoc wrought by the 13ft storm surge and catastrophic winds that battered the low-lying area that grows most of Burma&apos;s rice, the two-week delay appeared optimistic. &quot;We&apos;re talking of something on the scale of the tsunami,&quot; said Andrew Kirkwood, Burma country director for Save the Children. &quot;Initially we thought we were looking at a response over a couple of months, but now it looks like a couple of years.&quot; Teams from the agency have been in the outlying areas of Rangoon and Irrawaddy region assessing the true extent of the destruction to gauge the level of need. But with so many homes resembling piles of matchwood the task of providing for the survivors of a storm that affected more than a quarter of Burma&apos;s 53 million population is mind-boggling. Infrastructure in the broad swath of low-lying coastal area has been devastated, with hulking iron and concrete bridges that straddle the countless waterways turned into heaps of twisted junk. Boats that served as a lifeline for the delta&apos;s inhabitants sank in the storm, leaving aid agencies scrambling to get relief to those survivors among the 1 million homeless who have already spent four days braving the elements.  &quot;It&apos;s going to be a massive logistical operation and very, very difficult,&quot; said Save the Children&apos;s Kirkwood. &quot;The scale of the disaster is unprecedented in living memory in these areas.&quot; With the onset of the rainy season the priority for the agencies with teams in the country already is providing shelter, in the form of plastic sheeting, and clean drinking water to prevent an outbreak of waterborne disease.  Tens of thousands of people have been sheltering in schools, temples and monasteries, making the provision of sanitation a pressing need. Teams from aid agencies already operating in the country have started distributing food, cooking utensils, mosquito nets and even cash in some areas where people are still able to buy food, though prices have jumped between 50% and 100%. &quot;We hope to fly in more assistance within the next 48 hours,&quot; said Paul Risley, WFP spokesman in Bangkok. &quot;The challenge will be getting to the affected areas with road blockages everywhere.&quot; Even in Rangoon the situation remains bleak, though the roads were being slowly cleared of the debris of fallen trees and telegraph poles. &quot;Basically the services are all down,&quot; said Mark Canning, the British ambassador in Rangoon. &quot;There&apos;s no electricity, no telephone, no water and very little food. Drinking water is in very short supply. But the crucial thing is the diesel needed to keep backup pumps going.&quot; Thailand was among those trying to alleviate the tragedy, flying in another plane load of supplies yesterday, while India said it was loading two naval vessels to carry emergency aid to the Irrawaddy area.

Eriksson, resigned to losing his job at Manchester City, spoke with the president, Luis Filipe Vieira, and was offered a three-year contract with an annual salary of \u00a31.8m. The indications last night were that Eriksson may decide to wait until later in the summer, when he hopes there will be offers from England and Italy. However, his willingness to speak to Vieira, technically in breach of his contract at City, reiterates that he is resigned to being paid off by Thaksin Shinawatra after the end-of-season tour to Bangkok and Hong Kong. The Swede had intended to keep the talks secret but a Portuguese television crew was tipped off and filmed Vieira leaving the Radisson Edwardian hotel. Rui Costa, the Benfica player who is shortly to become the club&apos;s sporting director, was also present. Eriksson, who has been staying at the Radisson since he replaced Stuart Pearce last summer, entertained them in his penthouse suite. Although he may face some awkward questions from his employers, his position is understandable given that Thaksin and his associates have offered Luiz Felipe Scolari, the Portugal national team manager, a \u00a33.2m-a-year deal to take over after next month&apos;s European Championship. Eriksson said last night: &quot;I&apos;ve had a meeting with the Benfica people. I&apos;m considering the offer and it could be a step forward in my career.&quot; Thaksin confirmed yesterday that there would be &quot;an evaluation at the end of the season&quot; and, asked what that would entail, replied: &quot;What needs to be changed, what needs to be added to the success of the club.&quot; He was also asked to comment on the progress he had made finding a new manager. &quot;We have not decided yet,&quot; he said. &quot;All of them - Sven, Scolari, [Jose] Mourinho - they are all great coaches, great managers.

The top United States diplomat in Burma&apos;s largest city, Rangoon, confirmed the figure and said as many as 95% of all buildings in the affected area may have been demolished. Shari Villarosa, the charge d&apos;affaires of the US embassy in Burma, said there was a very real risk of disease outbreaks as the crisis continues. &quot;There may be over 100,000 deaths in the Irrawaddy delta area,&quot; she told reporters. The new toll came as UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon called on the junta to open its borders to aid workers and the US urged Asian countries such as China, Thailand and India to put pressure on the military regime. International frustration is mounting as disaster management experts fail to get the necessary visas to enter the country. Satellite pictures yesterday showed the bulk of the Irrawaddy delta - where most died - still under water. Planeloads of stockpiled supplies are on standby awaiting delivery to desperate victims, who have been living in water for five days. Delays in getting help to the survivors could spark a second humanitarian crisis, with an outbreak of waterborne disease in the tropical climate. &quot;Time is of the essence,&quot; said Ann Veneman, executive director of UN children&apos;s fund Unicef. &quot;Children are highly vulnerable to disease and hunger and they need immediate help to survive.&quot; Visa delays are to be raised by Ban Ki-Moon, who is to seek a meeting of officials to resolve the matter speedily. Documents leaked from a UN meeting in Bangkok revealed little sign of a solution.  Even after the Burmese junta gave permission for the UN to fly in a planeload of supplies, emergency teams were still awaiting travel documents to enter the country. The World Food Programme has 15 logistics experts and technicians in Bangkok awaiting visas, ready to fly to Rangoon at a moment&apos;s notice. The difficulty mirrored smaller aid agencies such as World Vision, M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) and Save the Children, whose teams have yet to get entry permits even though they have staff already working on the ground in Burma. World Vision, which has worked in Burma for 30 years and has 582 existing staff there, has 40 tonnes of supplies sitting in Dubai awaiting approval to fly.  &quot;We have warehouses around the world pre-positioned, ready to go and emergency response teams who can move at a moment&apos;s notice, all for such a disaster,&quot; said Pamela Sitko, of World Vision. &quot;Our office in Rangoon has been in negotiations with the social welfare minister since shortly after the cyclone hit.&quot; World Vision has also been seeking visas for &quot;less than 10&quot; technical and logistics experts. Save the Children has applied to send four staff and MSF only one so far. &quot;It&apos;s a dreadful situation,&quot; said Sitko. &quot;Time is critical. There&apos;s real risk of an outbreak of acute diarrhoea, dengue fever or malaria, even cholera. We remember from the tsunami all the pain and suffering.&quot; Aid agency staff already operating in the country have been given a relatively free hand to assess the scale of the disaster and distribute whatever emergency supplies they had stockpiled, though it is nowhere near the huge amount needed. &quot;The UN has managed to get some assessment teams into the field, but we need the floodgates to open,&quot; said Mark Canning, the British ambassador in Rangoon.  France has urged the UN to invoke its &quot;responsibility to act&quot; clause to break the logjam and deliver aid without waiting for the junta&apos;s approval. French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner said the clause, that allows aid delivery to citizens if their government failed, even if it breached national sovereignty, was being discussed at UN headquarters in New York. The French navy has ships with helicopters sitting off the worst affected areas of the Burmese coast and help could reach the disaster area in minutes, he said. But while the world waited survivors who have seen little aid stormed the few shops that opened in the Irrawaddy delta. With reports of hundreds of bodies along roadsides and in rice paddies the fear is that failure to dispose of the dead will pose a health hazard to the living. Andrew Kirkwood, Save the Children Burma country director, said at least the regime had begun assisting in distribution of the emergency aid already in place using 16 military helicopters, though it needed a great deal more help. But the diplomat, Villarosa, said: &quot;This is a very paranoid regime ... the longer the delay, the more victims are created.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-05-08T10:00:27Z", "tags": ["Cyclone Nargis", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "World news", "Global development", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/08/cyclonenargis.burma", "title": "Burma death toll could reach 100,000", "sentences": ["Documents leaked from a UN meeting in Bangkok revealed little sign of a solution.", "The World Food Programme has 15 logistics experts and technicians in Bangkok awaiting visas, ready to fly to Rangoon at a moment&apos;s notice."]}, {"article": "Six days after the typhoon that devastated southern Burma, bloated corpses are floating in the mangrove in the Irrawaddy delta. Meanwhile, growing numbers of disaster-hardened aid workers are queueing in neighbouring Bangkok for their visas. Only two UN flights have so far been allowed to land in Rangoon, but they are not the main problem for Burma&apos;s paranoid junta. It is the army of foreign aid workers who come in with them. The military regime can not reconcile the crying need for a massive international aid programme with the openness needed to direct it. Cyclone Nargis did not just strike one of the world&apos;s poorest delta regions with devastating force. It also came just seven days before a referendum due to be held on a constitution that will institutionalise the junta&apos;s grip. Keeping foreigners out of the politically sensitive countryside, where Burma&apos;s unfortunate citizens will be frogmarched to the polling booths on Saturday, is more important to the junta than the need to respond to a national emergency. No aid agency can even make a preliminary estimate of the casualties, but it is thought that over 100,000 people could have died and tens of thousands more could be at risk. The aid workers, however, will continue to wait for their visas. Aid agencies are congenitally cautious in their criticism of rogue regimes because of the access they require for their programmes. But they are privately furious at what is going on, not least because they are impotent to do anything about it. Airdrops have been discussed, but the two most critical needs of the survivors are fresh water and medical attention, neither of which can be delivered from the air. It gets worse. The three countries with any purchase over the regime in Rangoon are China, India and Thailand. After the uprising of Burma&apos;s monks last year, China helped get the UN special envoy Ibrahim Gambari into the country for a largely fruitless round of talks with the junta. After the Tibetan uprising this year, that lever over the Burma regime is now gone. China can hardly demand access for foreign aid workers in Burma when it is denying foreign human rights workers access to Tibet. Within 72 hours of the tsunami that swept Asia in 2004, an air bridge of military aircraft was opened to Indonesia, saving many lives. Even though Indonesian soldiers were fighting a bitter war in Aceh at the time, the aid got through to the shoreline that took the brunt of the tsunami and a peace deal was eventually declared. Analysts will look in vain today for an Aceh effect in Burma.

I hope this post can shed a little light on two unjustly obscure UFOs.  Jack O&apos;Connell is an American writer who has until now been relegated to the uncertain limbo between crime writing and mainstream literature. He has so far written five novels, which have all been showered with praise by the likes of James Ellroy, the New York Times and others, and the ghosts of Kafka, Joyce, Chandler, Greene and Pynchon have all been invoked by reviewers, but he still remains an acquired taste. But what a taste! All his books are set in the fictional city of Quinsigamond in the US&apos;s Massachusetts rust belt, a metropolis of rotting buildings, a thriving red light district, the notorious Bangkok Park, home of the bottom feeders and the lost of modern society, and a grander quarter now in dusty decline. Bleak? Not at all, O&apos;Connell&apos;s books are also a splendid and exuberant celebration of life - and plotwise, absolutely gripping. His debut novel Box Nine (1990) was about the invention of a super drug, and the wars between local gangs for its possession, a policewoman on the track of the drug&apos;s inventor, her twin brother who is a mailman, a Chinese linguist and a throng of oddballs embroiled in a veritable web of romance and violence. Wireless (1993) returned to the same bizarre territory, with the voice of a night DJ punctuating a baroque waltz of the damned. Skin Palace (1996) is also one of the best books about film I have come across, a tortuous and tortured tale about Quinsigamond&apos;s surviving cinema. His next effort, Word Made Flesh (1998) plunged into the unremitting darkness of Europe at war and the scars it leaves on today&apos;s Quinsigamond inhabitants. Hingeing on the desperate quest for a book printed on human flesh that has survived the Holocaust, the novel tackles major themes. In my view, a masterpiece, but also a book that disturbed a lot of readers (and sold badly) which goes some way to explaining why it would take another decade for O&apos;Connell to publish another novel. This is this year&apos;s The Resurrectionist, already out in the USA and appearing in the UK this winter. Well worth the wait. We are still in Quinsigamond, this time with holy bikers high on a cocktail of curious drugs; a shady clinic where experiments are being conducted on coma patients; the love of a father for his son and a gallery of deformed circus freaks in search of their saviour. And much more in the way of the bizarre and the touching. But it all makes sense. No one does the improbable like O&apos;Connell. My other candidate for your (re)discovery is from New Zealand. Chad Taylor was born in 1964 and has also published five novels. An earlier one, Heaven (1994), about the relationship between an architect and a stripper who can foretell the future in parts, was filmed but never released in the UK. Where O&apos;Connell is wide screen baroque, Taylor is a minimalist whose equally tortured characters populate a world where silence and night form a disconsolate backdrop for their musings and meanderings across a landscape of bleak, concrete cities. But what they have in common is a profound empathy for the losers in our midst and an acute sense of place and the bizarre in everyday life. Shirker (2000) is, ostensibly, about a man seeking odd antiques as he criss-crosses an unknown city, his past colliding with his present. It is also about anomie and how characters fail to connect with each other. Not quite a crime book, but certainly a mystery. The follow-up, Electric (2003), takes place as power is cut in a city reminiscent of Auckland - as the characters fumble in the dark and miss each other both figuratively and metaphorically. Nothing very much seems to happen, just couples coming together and undoing in real time and in memory, but the thin plot grips like a vice as you identify with one of the characters and then another. Departure Lounge (2006) is his latest novel and within a few pages you are unmistakably back in Chad Taylor land, a country I imagine cold and drear and metallic, where a plane crash and the uncertainty about its survivors poisons the life of all the struggling characters. Where O&apos;Connell usually has a multitude of characters and peoples every inch of the reader&apos;s mental screen, Taylor is sparse and damn economical.

By now, seven days after the calamity wrought by the Burmese cyclone that killed up to 100,000 people, he would expect the relief effort to be at its peak rather than stuck in the doldrums with aid agencies estimating only 10% of those affected reached so far.  &quot;We&apos;re just not reaching as many people as we should,&quot; he said. &quot;For something on this scale we&apos;d be hoping that 20, 30, 40 aid flights would be arriving every day, rather than 12 over a few days.&quot; Maps of the most severely hit districts of the Irrawaddy delta are as close as his team are getting as they plan by &quot;remote control&quot;, using WFP&apos;s overstretched staff already on the ground.

Two planeloads were impounded by the junta, prompting a temporary suspension in deliveries. UN flights were resumed last night, in the hope that negotiations would lead to a resolution. Gordon Brown called the Burmese action &quot;utterly unacceptable&quot;. He stopped short of joining France and the US in calling for aid deliveries without Burmese permission, although pressure within his government for such a move is growing.  Last night, the international development secretary, Douglas Alexander, said an emergency UN meeting today would demand urgent humanitarian access. A UN appeal launched yesterday raised almost half its target of $187m (\u00a396m). Britain&apos;s ambassador to the UN, Sir John Sawers, last night demanded that the Burmese government grant visas to aid workers, allow importation and distribution of food aid, and stop charging import duties on it. He also hinted Britain might back the distribution of aid without Burmese government permission. &quot;The United Nations will need to reflect on what steps it can take if a government prevents the international community from taking the steps needed to prevent an even greater disaster than the one we face now,&quot; Sawers said.  Britain&apos;s ambassador to Burma, Mark Canning, said authoritative estimates of the numbers of dead and missing ranged from 63,000 to 100,000, while up to 1.9 million people were vulnerable to water-borne disease, hunger and lack of drinkable water. &quot;So you can do the maths and you will see how quickly this thing can get larger.&quot; Small amounts of aid were trickling through, he added, but not nearly enough. Save the Children estimated that a tenth of the victims made homeless by Cyclone Nargis last Saturday had been reached by yesterday when aid deliveries were halted. Seven tonnes of high-energy biscuits flown in on a Thai commercial flight last Thursday were cleared by Burmese customs but the next two loads, 38 tonnes, enough to feed 95,000 people, were seized by the government.  &quot;All of the food aid and equipment we managed to get in has been confiscated,&quot; Paul Risley, a spokesman for the UN&apos;s World Food Programme, said in Bangkok. The regime was also blocking visas for aid workers. The foreign ministry said it would accept cash and material aid but not international aid workers; the government would distribute food aid. Britain is putting diplomatic pressure on Burma via China, India and Thailand. But if this fails in the next few days, it would look again at unilateral delivery. &quot;If it comes to letting hundreds of thousands of people die, of course we&apos;re not going to do that,&quot; a British official said.  &quot;There are people suffering,&quot; the prime minister told Sky TV. &quot;It&apos;s utterly unacceptable that, when international aid is offered, the regime will try to prevent that getting in.&quot; The row over food deliveries came after a standoff between the junta and the UN over visas for up to 40 disaster management experts.

We knew it was weak - category one, on a scale of five, and we knew it was the kind to quickly dissipate after running into the coast. We were wrong. It was category four by the time it ploughed into Burma and continued inland all the way past Rangoon. But, misinformed, we went into the bank holiday weekend unconcerned.

To build a picture of what was going on, we called key Red Cross personal in Bangkok, in the regional headquarters in Kuala Lumpur and at the Geneva HQ and we also consulted the Britain&apos;s Department for International Development. It quickly became clear that the scale of this was absolutely huge.  We released \u00a330,000 straight away from the British Red Cross disaster relief fund. and our disaster management team released stock from a warehouse in Kuala Lumpur - items such as tarpaulins and jerry cans - which are now being flown into Burma. On Tuesday, we met British Red Cross heads of Fundraising and Communications to organise a major appeal, which was launched half an hour later. The rest of my day was spent co-ordinating information from the International Federation of the Red Cross and Burmese Red Cross Society assessment teams on the ground and matching up the needs with what the British Red Cross could provide. A global teleconference was held on Wednesday to co-ordinate the provision of aid, materials and expertise. The next day the first Red Cross aid flight took off from warehouses in Kuala Lumpur with full approval from Burma&apos;s authorities. Plane needs to be approved on a flight-by-flight basis, but we&apos;re confident that regular aid flights will go on, for which we are grateful. The international co-operation and effort, with Red Cross societies, charities and NGOs and governments from across the world working together has been impressive.  The visa situation can be overcome and foreign expertise needs to be brought in to save lives. There is still time. Working with the Burmese Red Cross, the aid that has been flown in is already making its way to those who desperately need it. Things are moving slowly, but they are moving. This week will be critical. \u00b7 Mark South is a Red Cross media officer.

Not a cyclone that reaped death and destruction on a biblical scale. Not the international aid community banging on the door to get in to help. So yesterday survivors of the cataclysm that may have left 116,000 dead and 1.9m homeless were ordered to turn out and vote &apos;yes&apos; in the constitutional referendum by the generals who have held their country in a grip of stone for 46 years. Even as incoming aid was being impounded by the military as it landed at Rangoon and other aircraft sat waiting at foreign airports, unable to fly in without permission from the junta in their jungle capital of Naypidaw, state-run television was running political broadcasts and offering shots of uniformed generals handing packages of food to grateful peasants. The military have so far admitted to a death toll of 15,000. The only concession under the welter of international criticism and calls for the ballot to be postponed in the face of the crisis was a two-week postponement for survivors in the worst hit areas in Rangoon and the Irrawaddy delta, areas that took the full force of Cyclone Nargis. &apos;The generals in Naypidaw sense that with the referendum they&apos;re on the cusp of something politically huge,&apos; said one western diplomat in Rangoon. &apos;So they find it very hard to change completely their way of operating and let aid teams in with free access.&apos; The generals&apos; fear that an influx of foreigners could contaminate the process was given full vent late last week when a war of words broke out between the Burmese regime, rumoured to be engaged in its own internal power struggle, and the international community led by the United Nations. Frustration rose as visas were refused to aid experts while people went without water, food and shelter. The limited success of the UN and other aid agencies has left most survivors to fend for themselves, scavenging in the wreckage of their inundated homes. Rumours abound of bodies being hastily buried or thrown to the tides by soldiers. Only between 149,000 and 271,000 people - 10 per cent of those affected - have been reached, according to Save the Children. Aid agencies already in Burma have been working flat out to distribute the meagre emergency supplies that were stockpiled. The advance preparations in the days before Cyclone Nargis were never going to be enough for a disaster of such magnitude. The UN&apos;s Office for Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the lead agency for disaster management, called aid agencies together in Rangoon two days before the cyclone struck and established &apos;clusters&apos; - assigning each organisation responsibilities. None could have foreseen what Nargis would wreak. It had been building in the Bay of Bengal for almost a week, eyed warily by Bangladesh and India. Cyclone Sidr, which hit Bangladesh last November killing 3,500, left them all too aware of Nargis&apos;s potential. The cyclone began to deepen and intensify, tracking slowly eastward before finally making landfall at Haing Kyi island just off the Irrawaddy delta at 10.30pm local time, on Friday a week ago. It packed winds of 130mph, gusting to 160mph. But a deadly combination of circumstances did the real damage. The slow moving eye of the storm - just 11mph - left people subjected to the ferocious winds for hours as it tracked agonisingly along the delta coast before moving north-east to Rangoon. Yet it was the 12ft storm surge that was most deadly. The shallow shelf that stretches far out into the Andaman Sea allowed the waters to pile up as they came ashore, made worse by a high tide. The densely populated rice-growing delta was especially vulnerable. It is home to an estimated 7 million people, 2 million of whom live on land less than 15ft above sea level.  The development of rice farms and shrimp fisheries had seen the mangroves that might have blunted the storm surge cleared. Coastal villages constructed of flimsy bamboo huts were washed away like matchwood. Fifteen townships were all but wiped out with seven - among them Bogalay and Laputta - designated &apos;priority one&apos; by the Burmese authorities, that is, with between 90 and 95 per cent of the buildings destroyed. Thein Myint, 68, a fisherman near Bogalay, wept as he told how the cyclone swept away all 28 of his family members, leaving him the sole survivor. A neighbour, Htay Maung, 70, sheltering in the same Buddhist monastery that was among the few buildings sturdy enough to withstand the onslaught, told his story. &apos;We huddled together, but the big trees carried by the waves knocked down two of my children and my wife. &apos;Only two of my children survived.&apos; As Nargis reached Rangoon the winds had dropped to 98mph, but were fierce enough to uproot trees, blow down telegraph lines and tear off roofs. &apos;It was the length of it, it just went on and on, for six hours,&apos; said Dr Osamu Kunii, of Unicef. &apos;We knew it was forecast to be a big one but this was just so strong, such a huge amount of rainfall.&apos; By midday on Saturday it had moved on, leaving havoc. Then came the eerie calm as destroyed infrastructure prevented the regime comprehending the scale of the devastation. For three days the death toll appeared mercifully low, in just the hundreds. But then it began to be revised dizzyingly upwards until it now stands at 23,000 dead - 10,000 in Bogalay alone - and 42,000 missing, presumed dead. The real figure is likely to be many times that, however. Satellite images showed the true scale of the disaster, with the whole southern half of the Irrawaddy delta - 2,000 sq miles - still under water. With bridges turned to twisted junk and 80 per cent of boats sunk, getting aid to the most remote places is a mind-boggling task. Survivors who were able to walk from the farthest flung areas of the delta told of hundreds of corpses along roadsides or floating in rice paddies. Others still sit mute in the wreckage of their homes waiting for help that never comes. Yesterday Andrew Kirkwood, country director for Save the Children in Burma, took a helicopter trip over the area to assess the damage. &apos;It gave me a sense of the scale, the massive scale of the devastation. The death toll is a confusing issue. On Friday I checked figures collated by the UN and put it at 216,000 dead, but today I spoke to someone with a knowledge of this area who was talking about 400,000. It doesn&apos;t help that there hasn&apos;t been a census in these areas since 1983.&apos; &apos;When I flew over one island that was simply all sand, my pilot told me that there had once been a major village down there. That was a really choking moment for me, to look down on that. &apos;But elsewhere I saw signs of life, canoes moving around waterways and tarpaulins of rice hung out - that gave me real hope that it is not too late to help many people.&apos; He said that so far they estimated that just around 10 per cent of the people affected had received food or medical aid. &apos;We can only hope people down there are finding ways of looking after each other at the moment.&apos; The aid agency has set up a base in Pathein, the capital of the Irrawaddy delta, and is distributing emergency food, water, shelter and mosquito nets in an effort to stave off the threat of diseases like cholera and outbreaks of waterborne illnesses like acute diarrhoea. There are also fears that the military are moving people away from affected areas and relocating them in towns where food and water is already scarce - something that can create a new refugee problem. &apos;Our workers are traumatised by what they are seeing and we have had to assign doctors as counsellors,&apos; said Dr Kunii. But I have been moved by the support of people who have shared the little food or water they have with strangers.&apos; But the extraordinary row between the Burmese leaders and the international community over outside help has ensured that the ramping up of the relief effort is far from where it should be a week after a natural disaster. Delays are costing the lives of survivors as scores of UN and aid agency disaster specialists and doctors have been kept out, vainly waiting in Bangkok for visas that never come. The foreign ministry said it welcomed aid, but not aid workers, but there are hints that the generals may relent. Yesterday three London-based logistics experts from the medical charity Merlin were allowed into Rangoon to co-ordinate their organisation&apos;s relief effort, staffed mainly by local teams. Merlin had around 600 community health workers in Burma before the cyclone hit. Merlin&apos;s Yves-Kim Creac&apos;h said Pandaw, a British-owned luxury cruise company working in the Irrawaddy delta, had offered one of their vessels to help with the relief effort. The river cruiser was being kitted out with medical supplies and is expected to set sail today. &apos;Send us skilled people but not untrained do-gooders, we have not enough hotel rooms or supplies to share with those people,&apos; said Dr Kunii. &apos;I saw it after the tsunami when aid work was hampered, not helped, by too many unskilled people pouring in.&apos; Just a handful of relief planes have landed in Rangoon as the UN World Food Programme wrangled with the regime to get its specialists on the ground to facilitate the distribution. By comparison, one plane was landing in Aceh every hour a week after the 2004 tsunami. There were hopes that the first US flight may be allowed to land tomorrow. But even when the planes land there are no guarantees the help will reach those who need it - there was an extraordinary stand-off on Friday night after the authorities impounded 38 tonnes of World Food Programme high-energy biscuits, intent on distributing the aid using the army. WFP is negotiating for the release of the aid and hoped to send three planes yesterday. Burma&apos;s residents are normally reticent about criticising their government, but Nargis has emboldened many. &apos;The government has gone crazy,&apos; said a taxi driver last night. &apos;They are not doing nearly enough to help people.&apos;", "publicationDate": "2008-05-10T23:07:12Z", "tags": ["Cyclone Nargis", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Human rights", "World news", "Global development", "Society", "Homelessness", "Law", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/11/cyclonenargis.burma", "title": "How generals turned their backs on disaster", "sentences": ["Delays are costing the lives of survivors as scores of UN and aid agency disaster specialists and doctors have been kept out, vainly waiting in Bangkok for visas that never come."]}, {"article": "Experts were revising upwards their predictions of how many will die in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis as Oxfam warned today the figure could reach 1.5 million and foreign secretary David Miliband said the death toll would rise &quot;significantly&quot; from the 100,000 currently predicted. Speaking to reporters in Bangkok, Oxfam&apos;s Thailand regional chief Sarah Ireland said the 100,000 deaths talked of by other aid agencies and a senior US diplomat may be dwarfed if areas of Burma are not provided with clean water and sanitation soon. &quot;With the likelihood of 100,000 or more killed in the cyclone there are all the factors for a public health catastrophe which could multiply that death toll by up to 15 times,&quot; she said. &quot;In the Boxing Day tsunami, 250,000 lost their lives in the first few hours but we did not see an outbreak of disease because the host governments and the world mobilised a massive aid effort to prevent it happening. Miliband said he would be amazed if the numbers dead were not already 100,000.  &quot;I would be amazed if there hadn&apos;t been about 100,000 who had died already \u2026 what&apos;s more, hundreds of thousands more are at risk&quot;, he told the BBC&apos;s Politics Show.  He blamed the &quot;malign neglect&quot; of the Burmese regime which was in part turning the disaster in a &quot;humanitarian catastrophe of genuinely epic proportions&quot;.  International development secretary Douglas Alexander also told the BBC&apos;s Sunday AM programme that he feared the death toll would rise &quot;significantly&quot; from the 100,000 currently predicted. He did, however, express cautious optimism that the Burmese government&apos;s attitude towards western agencies appeared to be softening, saying there had been &quot;progress&quot; in the past few hours - a British government assessment team had been allowed into the country this morning and that there had been aid flights over night. In the week since the cyclone struck, the Burmese military government has frustrated the efforts of international aid agencies to provide help. Aid agencies have repeatedly complained that aid is not being distributed quickly enough due lengthy clearance process, and that visas were not being made available to some specialists trained to deal with humanitarian disasters. On Friday the UN halted flights to the country after the Burmese government impounded two of their aid planes. These were resumed yesterday. A UN road convoy and three Red Cross planes arrived in the country and this morning a Red Cross chartered flight arrived in the largest city Rangoon carrying 35 tonnes of equipment and medical supplies. This morning, Alexander said British officials in Rangoon had reported that 40 lorries were leaving the city and heading south and aid was starting to reach more survivors. &quot;There is some evidence that there is more latitude in terms of the NGOs being able to deliver aid in the country&quot; Alexander said. French humanitarian organisation Medecins du Monde said it had been given permission by the Burmese government to distribute aid inside the country. It said its plane would arrive in the country tomorrow. At the moment Burma&apos;s military government say 23,335 people have died and 37,019 are missing. The UN estimates 2 million people to have been severely affected. Yesterday Burmese generals were quick to turn the first shipment of aid to political ends \u2013 government officials were seen handing it out from boxes on which the names of prominent generals had been written. Voting booths sprang up in areas that had been destroyed by Cyclone Nargis as the proposed referendum on Burma&apos;s constitution went ahead as planned, despite criticism from the international community. Tim Costello of World Vision Australia suggested that Burmese generals had been reluctant to allow international aid workers into the country because they suspected them of spying on the referendum.

After prolonged negotiations with the ruling military junta, the US finally got permission to send a cargo plane carrying water, mosquito nets and blankets to Rangoon. Two more planeloads are scheduled for tomorrow. &quot;Today&apos;s flight is just the first step and we hope they will allow us to do more in the future,&quot; said Lieutenant Colonel Douglas Powell, a spokesman for the US military. &quot;It&apos;s really just up to what the Burmese will allow us to do.&quot; The Burmese regime has been condemned for its callous response to the tragedy, barring access to most international disaster relief specialists and blocking aid. The prime minister, Gordon Brown, today said the military authorities failure to cooperate with international relief agencies was &quot;completely unacceptable&quot; and pledged Britain would use its chairmanship of the UN security council to press for action.  The Royal Navy ship HMS Westminster is heading to Burma to help humanitarian operations.  Aid agencies are warning of an &quot;unimaginable tragedy&quot; if significant amounts of relief did not arrive quickly. The official death toll reached almost 32,000 while the number of missing fell to 33,416, though the UN estimates 100,000 died. More planes loaded with emergency supplies were landing in Rangoon today. But UN officials said it was getting through to the cyclone&apos;s 1.5 million survivors at only a fraction of the rate needed. &quot;We think we need to be moving 375 tonnes of food a day down into the affected areas. We are doing less than 20 percent of that,&quot; the UN&apos;s World Food Programme spokesman Marcus Prior said. The WFP got clearance for 38 tonnes of high-energy biscuits that had been impounded on Friday by the Burmese authorities. With another 17 tonnes airlifted and taken to bases in the delta, it was enough to feed 27,400 people. The Red Cross said it had managed to get a fourth flight into Rangoon, with others due today - all adding up to tonnes of medical supplies. Aid agencies reported that the cyclone&apos;s survivors were increasingly moving out of the delta - in some cases relocated by the Burmese authorities - to camps on the fringes of the worst-affected areas. The UN said about 206,000 people were crowded into 218 camps, often schools, monasteries or temples, that withstood the cyclone&apos;s force and the tidal wave that washed over the delta. In Laputta, one of the most devastated towns with 95% of buildings damaged or destroyed, as many as 150,000 people were crammed into shelters. Agencies are concerned that without proper sanitation and clean water, people scavenging in the inundated remains of their homes could die from waterborne diseases. &quot;Everything hinges on access,&quot; said Greg Beck, of the International Rescue Committee. &quot;Unless there is fast infusion of aid, there is going to be a tragedy of an unimaginable scale.&quot; The UN said its top representative in Burma had flown today to Naypyidaw, the generals&apos; new capital, to hand over in person a list of 60 &quot;critical&quot; UN and relief agency staff it says are vital to the relief effort and should be allowed in. None of its staff waiting in Bangkok to enter Burma have been given visas, and it says some of those already in the country are being prevented from leaving Rangoon. &quot;There are limits, if not bans, on staff going to the delta,&quot; Terje Skavdal, a UN spokesman, said. The British public was today urged to continue donating to an appeal fund to help save the lives of those affected. The Disaster Emergency Committee (DEC) has raised more than \u00a35m so far. But the DEC, an umbrella group for organisations working on the ground in Burma, has warned that much more money is needed to stave off a humanitarian crisis. Brendan Gormley, the DEC chief executive, said: &quot;It is vital that people continue to support the DEC appeal.

The team that accompanied the first US flight loaded with emergency supplies met cabinet ministers from the ruling junta to offer relief, disaster management expertise and a muscular military capability to deliver aid to the hardest hit areas. But the Burmese delegation merely said it would consider the offer, even as aid agencies warned that only 10% of the logistical staff needed to cope with the estimated 1.9 million homeless had arrived in the country 10 days after Cyclone Nargis struck. Few now believe the isolated Burmese leadership is likely to have a change of heart over large scale outside assistance, despite international pressure and mounting anger of the UN and aid agencies. Further consignments of aid - including the US flight - entered Burma yesterday, but there were continued warnings that it was far from enough to meet the scale of the disaster, which is believed to have killed more than 100,000 people. State television raised the official death toll to 31,938, with 29,770 missing. The UN&apos;s World Food Programme said it was delivering emergency rations to those in the hardest hit region, the Irrawaddy delta, at only a fraction of that required. &quot;We think we need to be moving 375 tonnes of food a day down into the affected areas,&quot; said Marcus Prior, a WFP spokesman in Bangkok. &quot;We are doing less than 20% of that.&quot; But Andrew Kirkwood, the country director of Save the Children, saw a glimmer of hope, estimating that as many as half of those affected by the cyclone had been reached, a big rise from the dismal proportion of 10% late last week. However, there was little sign of progress for international disaster experts awaiting visas to assist with the rescue effort. The UN senior representative in Burma flew to the capital, Naypyidaw, and presented the generals with a list of 60 &quot;critical&quot; UN and agency staff. The US&apos;s first shipment, of 12 tonnes of mosquito nets, blankets and water, was dispatched from a Thai air force base after days of negotiations with the Burmese. Pallets of relief adorned with banners proclaiming &quot;USaid from the American people&quot; were slid aboard the C-130 military transport, with speeches by Admiral Timothy Keating, head of US Pacific Command, and Henrietta Fore, US Agency for International Development (USaid) administrator.  &quot;This is Burma&apos;s hour of need, and the need is urgent,&quot; said Fore, before boarding with the team bound for Rangoon. &quot;We stand ready to help with our humanitarian relief items.&quot; The US determination to have its own personnel oversee the distribution of its aid supplies rather than &quot;dump&quot; them at Rangoon airport appeared to have evaporated yesterday even as a senior USaid official continued to insist it was vital. &quot;Basically, in order to rapidly and dramatically increase the scale of the supplies you need expert assessment teams on the ground,&quot; said Olivier Carduner, USaid&apos;s Asia development director. &quot;No one wants to see large amounts of relief supplies on the ground when they&apos;re not being used.&quot; Initial talks that would have allowed Save the Children to take control of the US consignment faltered when the regime said it would take charge. A Burmese government spokesman, Ye Htut, said later that the US aid had been transferred to military trucks and was due to be ferried by helicopter to the delta within hours. The US team offered the Burmese delegation a further \u00a37.5m in food aid and logistical assistance, an increase from the \u00a31.6m it has already committed. The fresh donation would include 1,000 tonnes of emergency food over the coming weeks. The delegation added that six C-130 aircraft, numerous helicopters and 4,000 marines were on standby to help if permission was given. Three US navy ships will be stationed in international waters off the Irrawaddy coastline within 48 hours, Keating said on his return. But he said the Burmese would only take the various offers of assistance &quot;under consideration&quot;. Fore said: &quot;We&apos;ll take it one day at a time.

More than one week after Cyclone Nargis hit Burma, the death toll has exceeded 100,000 - and will continue to rise if the regime persists in denying aid access. The statistics are staggering - more than 1.5 million people left homeless, at least 40% of them children. The UN has described it as &quot;a major catastrophe&quot;. The time has come for action - real action. The regime has proven not only its incompetence, but its extraordinary inhumanity, conclusively. It ignored the 41 warnings issued by India from April 26 about the impending cyclone - and left its people unprepared and defenceless. When the cyclone hit Insein prison in Rangoon, prisoners who were trapped in their cells broke out into the yard to avoid being crushed. They were not trying to escape. Nevertherless, in an example of the regime&apos;s cruelty, 36 were shot dead. More than 24 countries have pledged over $40m in emergency aid - but only a trickle is getting through. There are consistent reports that the regime is manipulating aid for its own cruel purposes - distributing it for propaganda gain, or selling it on the streets for profit. The authorities have been selling roofing materials - and forcing people to clear the wreckage and rebuild their communities with no assistance. Instead of helping the victims of the cyclone, the junta ignored the UN secretary general&apos;s call to postpone the referendum on a new constitution - and went ahead with the sham on May 10. The vote was delayed - until May 24 - only for those in the cyclone-affected areas, resulting in the ridiculous situation of people voting on different days. That in itself is a sign that the referendum falls far short of any acceptable election standards. In addition, in many areas local authorities have forced villagers to vote &quot;yes&quot;, or even cast their ballots for them. Meanwhile, the military continues its brutal offensive against the Karen people. According to the relief organisation the Free Burma Rangers, the Burmese army &quot;has launched numerous attacks&quot; against villagers and internally displaced people throughout northern Karen state. &quot;Hundreds have been displaced, villages and homes have been burned down and villagers killed as the Burma army has stepped up its efforts to terrorise villagers into hiding&quot;, the group claims. Hundreds are fleeing as &quot;the Burma army mortars villages, captures and kills villagers, and continues to expand its network of military camps into the farms and villages of the local Karen people.&quot; The National League for Democracy, led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who remains under house arrest, has issued an appeal to the international community to help &quot;by any means&quot;. Their plea should be taken seriously. If within the next 24 hours the regime has not expedited visas, opened up to all international aid workers and allowed the unrestricted distribution of aid, the international community should go in regardless. Otherwise, what does the UN&apos;s much trumpeted &quot;responsibility to protect&quot; principle, passed unanimously in 2005 by the security council, mean? There are US warships and aircraft in the region which could be mobilised at short notice to provide protection for teams of aid workers and consignments of aid. Not a military invasion - an invasion of aid and assistance. Other countries could provide support as well. There has been talk of air drops, but their impact is questionable. If dropped by air, how can we be sure the aid will reach the people? Aid packages could land in flood water or paddy fields and be lost or wasted. They could easily be seized by the military. To ensure the aid reaches the people who need it, aid consignments should be accompanied by aid workers on the ground - and if necessary, they should go in with the protection of an international force. There are few regimes which are as bad as Burma&apos;s. When the earthquake hit Iran five years ago, the country accepted international, including US, assistance despite political tensions. The conduct of Burma&apos;s despicable regime has shown to the world once again that it is completely unfit to govern. How much longer will the UN drag its feet with negotiations? As Charm Tong, from the Shan Women&apos;s Action Network, said at a press conference in Bangkok on May 10, &quot;the survivors must be wondering if the world has forgotten them. This is not the time to go along with the regime&apos;s restrictions.

Rescuers are struggling to reach those who are trapped because many mountain roads are blocked by landslides of mud and rubble. &quot;At least 10,000 die as landslide seals off towns and bar way for rescuers,&quot; the Times reports. &quot;There are fears that tens of thousands still lie buried in debris in Wenchuan, where 110,000 residents have failed to make contact with the outside world.&quot; The quake, which reached a magnitude of 7.9, struck yesterday at 2.28pm local time (6.28am BST) and was followed by several aftershocks. Tremors were felt as far away as Bangkok and Vietnam. The Times says after the school collapse in Dijiangyan &quot;some buried teenagers were struggling to break loose from underneath the ruins while others were crying out for help&quot;. Two girls told how they escaped because they ran faster than some of the others did. The Guardian says at least 50 bodies were pulled out of the rubble, and the state broadcaster issued advice for those trapped, saying: &quot;If you&apos;re buried, keep calm and conserve your energy. Seek water and food and wait patiently for rescue.&quot; The Telegraph writes that the army was yet to reach the worst-affected areas. Up to forty aftershocks in the hours following the earthquake triggered landslides of mud and rubble that knocked out phone lines and telephone masts. The landslides have blocked mountain roads leading to Wenchuan, and rescue teams were having great difficulty getting medical supplies to those who are still trapped. The Chinese premier, Wen Jiabo, said: &quot;We must make every sacrifice to open the road. Our first priority is the race to save people. Every minute, every second that you gain is a chance to save one more trapped person. The Telegraph also brings the focus of the natural disaster back to the Olympic games, to be held in August. &quot;With the Beijing Olympics just weeks away, China is anxious to avoid any comparison with the mismanagement of relief efforts in Burma,&quot; the paper writes. The death toll is predicted to rise, with Unicef pointing out that Sichuan is one of the most populous provinces. There is also heavy rain forecast for the coming days. * Telegraph: &apos;Tens of thousands&apos; dead*Times: China quake: 10,000 dead KNIFE CRIME BACK IN NEWS The murder of a 22-year-old man on Oxford Street yesterday in broad daylight - coming so soon after the killing of 16-year-old Jimmy Mizen on Saturday - has prompted coverage of knife crime in the capital. The Sun splashes on the shopping street murder with a picture of the weapon, dropped at the scene as the attackers fled. &quot;A bloody blade litters Britain&apos;s busiest street after a man is stabbed in rush hour. The same day, courts are told to let knife yobs off with a slap on wrist&quot;, it says, linking the killing to new sentencing guidelines. These state that a fine or community service can be applied to defendants carrying a &quot;bladed article or offensive weapon&quot; that is &quot;not used to threaten or cause fear&quot;. The Mirror focuses on Jimmy&apos;s murder, calling him &quot;Saint Jimmy&quot; on its front page, quoting his mother Margaret, who says she has taken comfort in the fact that her son died in his brother&apos;s arms. Jimmy was killed outside a bakery near his family home in Lee, south-east London, on Saturday, his throat cut by a shard of glass. &quot;If anyone gets to heaven it will be him,&quot; his mother says. &quot;Jimmy was a saint. He was 16 years and a day old and I never once told him off. He didn&apos;t have a bad thought about people. &quot;People keep saying to me why aren&apos;t you angry? There is so much anger in the world. It&apos;s anger that killed my son.&quot; According to the Mirror&apos;s report, police say they have found no link between Jimmy and the suspect, a 19-year-old from a local Turkish family. The Telegraph reports that police fear the suspect may have fled the country and they have told all airports, stations and ports to be on high alert. There were 26 people stabbed or fatally shot in London last year. *Sun: Knifemare: Bloodshed on the streets*Mirror: Mum pays tribute to her saint Jimmy CHERIE - THE REVELATIONS CONTINUE The Sun and the Times carry the next instalment from Cherie Blair&apos;s book, Speaking For Myself. This morning&apos;s offerings centre on Cherie&apos;s observations following the death of David Kelly, the MoD expert who was at the heart of the row between the government and the BBC over Iraq&apos;s alleged weapons of mass destruction. Cherie writes about the moment Tony Blair received the news that David Kelly was dead: &quot;I saw him slump into his seat. From sitting upright he just crashed. David Kelly was dead, he said. His body had been found in woodlands close to his home. It was awful. &quot;He decided then and there that there had to be an investigation and spoke to Charlie Falcolner, now lord chancellor, from the plane to see which judge might be available. &quot;I have never seen Tony so distraught and I felt utterly helpless to do anything,&quot; she says. Later she adds that in the 25 years she had known her husband, she had never seen him so badly affected by anything. Cherie writes that when her husband spoke to Alastair Campbell, he said he couldn&apos;t handle it anymore and wanted out. The extracts detail Cherie&apos;s relationship with Blair&apos;s former press supremo, and his increasingly heightened concerns over her friendship with the &quot;lifestyle guru&quot; Carole Caplin. *Sun: &apos;Tony was never so distraught&apos;*Times: Campbell &apos;literally spitting&apos; over Caplin CIVIL COURTS JUDGE WIGS OBSOLETE Judges in civil and family cases in Britain will do away with a 300-year-old tradition this autumn, when they will no longer wear horsehair wigs. Instead, they will dress in gowns designed by Betty Jackson, according to reports in the Guardian and the Times. The new outfit is a loose gown that incorporates coloured bands to indicate levels of seniority and has velvet trims on the cuffs. The Guardian reveals Lord Phillips, the lord chief justice, is behind the move, having long been convinced that old-fashioned legal dress adds to the public perception that the courts are out of touch. The piece says Lord Phillips &quot;modelled the new bare-headed look which will prevail from October 1, when judges hearing civil and family cases in England and Wales consign their 300-year horsehair headgear to history.&quot; It goes on to say that from this autumn most judges will adopt the simple continental style black gown. The Guardian&apos;s deputy fashion editor, Hadley Freeman, likens the outfit to &quot;something an alien android with menacing religious undertones would wear when waging war with Doctor Who&quot;. *Guardian: Judges&apos; new designer look unveiled*Times: Lord Chief Justice and his funky new gown SEX AND THE CITY OF LONDON Fevered headlines were elicited from a sudden swelling of London&apos;s fashion stakes in the West End last night, when the long-awaited Sex and the City film premiered on Leiceister Square. &quot;Sirens of the City,&quot; declares the Mail on page three. The report refers to Sarah Jessica Parker, who wore a Philip Treacy hat complete with green flowers and two green and black butterflies, as the &quot;green goddess&quot;. Her arrival at the premiere provoked near hysteria among fans, it says. Not to be outdone, Kim Cattrall wore a red Viviene Westwood, Kristin Davis a vintage cherry-coloured dress, and Cynthia Nixon a revealing, black Calvin Klein offering. Somewhat surprisingly, the Independent runs a photograph of the four women pictured from behind on its front page: &quot;They&apos;re back - and Carrie is still a star turn.&quot; The Telegraph says: &quot;For one night only Carrie and Co are west end girls.&quot; But the real question was why the premiere was held in London rather than New York, the so-called &quot;fifth woman&quot; of the series. The women gave diplomatic responses when asked, generally answering that the show was not just about New York, it had gone all over the world. Sarah Jessica Parker said: &quot;This is where New Line Cinema decided to do it, so we started here. We are thrilled to be in London, and we will be thrilled to take it to America.&quot; *Independent: A dazzling entrance*Mail: Shrubs and the City*Telegraph: Parker defends London premiere DEATH OF THE ALARM CLOCK More than 70% of us now believe the alarm clock has become obsolete, with Britons increasingly choosing mobile phones or MP3 players for the morning wake-up call. According to a study carried out by the hotel chain Travelodge, the results of which are in the Mail and on the Telegraph&apos;s front page today, 16 million people prefer a ring tone to wake them instead of an alarm clock. By way of explanation, Dr Chris Idzikowsji, director of the Edinburgh Sleep Centre told the Mail: &quot;The alarm clock&apos;s strident ringing tone can be a shock to the body and mind. My recommendation is to wake up naturally.&quot; *Mail: Time runs out for the alarm clock COMING UP ON GUARDIAN.CO.UK TODAY *Balls attacks leader of 10p tax rebels*Clinton eyes landslide primary win*Guardian Daily podcast", "publicationDate": "2008-05-13T09:46:34Z", "tags": [], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/may/13/wrap.leeglendinning", "title": "Knives and wigs", "sentences": ["Tremors were felt as far away as Bangkok and Vietnam."]}, {"article": "I realised we were in danger when our remarkably brave local contact told us the military government had put out a request to all hotels asking for a list of foreigners, writes Dan Rivers. We were told the regime had seen one of my reports and was furious I was in the country. They were specifically looking for me.  I was sceptical at first, but over the next few days it became apparent that despite the biggest humanitarian crisis in Burma&apos;s history, the government was expending considerable time and energy trying to stop me from reporting on the true extent of the disaster. A colleague from the BBC had already been deported on arrival from the airport and it was clear they wanted me out next. We started taking all the precautions we could, changing vehicles, changing locations, and constantly staying on the move. But it was as we made our way into the worst affected parts of the delta that I realised how serious the junta was in its attempts to stop me. My colleagues had stopped to ask a local government worker whether the road ahead was clear. I&apos;d decided to hide in a restaurant while this was happening, not wanting to be recognised. The civil servant said the road to Laputta was passable, but then a local immigration officer came over and started comparing everyone&apos;s passport photos to a photo of me, apparently taken from my last report on CNN. The others were shocked, but played dumb. The subsequent questioning lasted for an hour or so, but finally my team was released, the authorities presuming they were something to do with the aid operation in the area. Meanwhile, I was pacing the streets worried they hadn&apos;t returned, trying to remain inconspicuous, which was difficult when I was the only white face in town. Someone asked me half mockingly if I was with the CIA. I just laughed nervously and hoped the curiosity would die down. Eventually I was reunited with the others, who were now all very concerned for our safety. We decided though to push on further towards Laputta, along miles of dirt roads, until we spotted a checkpoint at a bridge. I hid in the boot of the car under a blanket, my cameraman scrambling to throw bags and boxes on top of me to disguise my contorted, lanky form. I was sweating heavily and frankly by now rather scared. The three policemen on guard turned us back, saying the senior civil servant in the last town wanted to speak to us all again. We were now convinced that the authorities knew we were a TV crew and during the drive back we decided we were heading to certain arrest. Our last gamble involved veering off the road along a jungle path towards the river. We hid the vehicle as best we could and managed to persuade some bemused villagers to take us across the river in two small boats. It was while walking out of that village that we were caught by a gruff, fat man who was barking into a walkie-talkie. I was horrified. He told us we weren&apos;t allowed any further and that the police were waiting for us at our vehicle. We were marched back, ever more alarming thoughts of what might happen next swirling through my mind. The police were at first angry and suspicious, but emolliating words, cigarettes, water and snack bars seemed to calm things down. They insisted on checking all our passports. I felt a churning sense of dread as I prepared to hand mine over. My greatest concern was for the local members of our team, who faced possible imprisonment and beatings if we were found out. I showed my passport, but managed to keep my thumb over both my first and last names. As my manager later pointed out, thank God CNN hired a middle-class lad whose parents had given him two middle names. Those middle names were the details the rather incompetent policeman radioed ahead. Eventually we were released and allowed to return to Yangon. I&apos;d had enough by this time, realising my presence was endangering the others, so I decided to leave. I got through immigration and customs and had actually sat down on the plane when there was one last surprise. The flight attendant told me immigration needed to check my details again - waiting at the gate were half a dozen police, special branch officers and soldiers. They photographed every possession I had and searched me thoroughly, even removing my shoes and socks. Thankfully I&apos;d dumped any tapes and photos, and with the flight already delayed, the flight attendant was impatiently imploring them to make a decision on whether I was allowed to board the plane. After a few minutes, they reluctantly gave in and I left, still trembling from 12 hours of exhausting tension being hunted by the junta. It all gives perhaps a small idea of the repression and intolerance of this regime. That it cannot countenance the independent reporting of a natural disaster speaks loudly and clearly to the generals&apos; utter paranoia. That they see fit to devote such resources and energy stopping reporters, aid-workers and the United Nations from entering, rather than helping their own devastated people, is a damning indictment of their callous disregard for those who have lost everything. \u00b7 Dan Rivers is CNN&apos;s Bangkok-based correspondent and has just returned from reporting in Burma.

France has suggested invoking the UN principle of a &quot;responsibility to protect&quot; victims if Burma continued to bar foreign relief teams.  Solana said such measures could be applied in a country that has suffered a catastrophe but where the authorities would not allow the fast arrival of aid. Louis Michel, the EU development aid commissioner, will travel to the region immediately after the emergency meeting to press for better access for relief supplies. However, he does not yet have a visa or any guarantee that he will be allowed into the country.  International frustration is continuing to grow as the Burmese authorities refuse to back down on the ban on foreign aid workers.  The team that accompanied the first US flight, loaded with emergency supplies, met cabinet ministers from the ruling junta to offer relief, disaster management expertise and a &quot;muscular&quot; military capability to deliver aid to the hardest hit areas.  The Burmese delegation merely said it would consider the offer, even as aid agencies warned that only 10% of the logistical staff needed to cope with the estimated 1.9 million homeless had arrived in the country 10 days after Cyclone Nargis struck. Few now believe the isolated Burmese leadership is likely to have a change of heart over large-scale outside assistance, despite international pressure and mounting anger of the UN and aid agencies. Further consignments of aid, including the US flight, entered Burma yesterday, but there were continued warnings that it would be far from enough to meet the scale of the disaster, believed to have killed more than 100,000 people. State television increased the official death toll to 31,938, with 29,770 missing. The UN&apos;s World Food Programme (WFP) said it was delivering emergency rations to those in the hardest hit Irrawaddy delta region, but that the aid was a=only a fraction of what was needed. &quot;We think we need to be moving 375 tonnes of food a day down into the affected areas,&quot; Marcus Prior, a WFP spokesman, said in Bangkok. &quot;We are doing less than 20% of that.&quot; The first US shipment contained 12 tonnes of mosquito nets, blankets and water and was dispatched from a Thai air force base after days of negotiations with Burmese officials.  Pallets of relief adorned with banners proclaiming &quot;USaid from the American people&quot; were loaded on board the C-130 military transport, with speeches by Admiral Timothy Keating, head of US Pacific Command, and Henrietta Fore, US Agency for International Development (USaid) administrator. &quot;This is Burma&apos;s hour of need, and the need is urgent,&quot; Fore said. &quot;We stand ready to help with our humanitarian relief items.&quot; The US determination for its own personnel to oversee the distribution of its aid supplies rather than &quot;dump&quot; them at Rangoon appeared to have evaporated yesterday, even as a senior USaid official continued to insist it was vital. &quot;Basically, in order to rapidly and dramatically increase the scale of the supplies you need expert assessment teams on the ground,&quot; Olivier Carduner, USaid&apos;s Asia development director, said.  &quot;No one wants to see large amounts of relief supplies on the ground when they&apos;re not being used.&quot; The US team offered the Burmese delegation a further \u00a37.5m in food aid and logistical assistance - an increase on the \u00a31.6m it has already committed.  The fresh donation would include 1,000 tonnes of emergency food over the coming weeks. &quot;We&apos;ll take it one day at a time,&quot; Fore said. &quot;I believe our discussions were a good first step ... but it will take time.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-05-13T12:28:55Z", "tags": ["Cyclone Nargis", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Global development", "Society", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/13/cyclonenargis.burma2", "title": "Use all means to get aid to Burma, says EU chief", "sentences": ["&quot;We think we need to be moving 375 tonnes of food a day down into the affected areas,&quot; Marcus Prior, a WFP spokesman, said in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "The United Nations yesterday called for an air bridge or a sea corridor to channel aid on the scale of that for the Indian Ocean tsunami to get desperately needed relief to the Burma cyclone disaster survivors. Just a fraction of the food and emergency supplies needed for the estimated 1.9 million homeless people has reached the country 11 days after the catastrophe because of the Burmese regime&apos;s intransigence. EU ministers meeting in Brussels urged that all means possible be used to get aid into the country, as the UN warned of a second catastrophe sparked by hunger and disease due to the lack of clean water, food, medical supplies and shelter. But the World Health Organisation scotched speculation of an outbreak of cholera in cyclone-ravaged areas of the Irrawaddy delta, where bloated corpses and animal carcasses have contaminated flooded areas, even as torrential rainy season downpours continued unabated. However, cases of diarrhoea, dysentery and skin infections have hit some of those sheltering in the hundreds of crowded makeshift camps, which lack adequate sanitation to cope with the numbers. The official death toll brought about by Cyclone Nargis rose again last night to 34,273, while the number of missing stood at 27,838. The UN estimates up to 101,000 people may have perished in the cyclone and accompanying storm surge in the Irrawaddy delta. Aid again trickled into Burma yesterday with the arrival of two US relief flights from Thailand and three M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) planes with 120 tonnes of medical supplies, food, plastic sheeting and water purification equipment. But at the same time the regime continued to insist it did not need international assistance, increasing restrictions on foreign aid workers already in the country. Armed checkpoints in Rangoon sought to prevent foreigners leaving the city. International staff working for MSF have been unable to secure permits to travel beyond Rangoon to carry out relief work in the delta. Two hundred Burmese staff are at work there, although in Bogalay, one of the worst-hit places, even they were not allowed beyond the town limits. The UN said children in the makeshift camps were at risk of trafficking and sexual abuse as orphans and those separated from parents were being forced to live alongside strangers. &quot;We are really concerned about the risk of exploitation and sexual abuse,&quot; said Anne-Claire Dufay, of the UN children&apos;s agency in Burma. &quot;If they don&apos;t have private sleeping spaces it could be an issue.&quot; From scant population data, Unicef estimates that a third of those who died in the cyclone were children.

A cursory Google search could have told them of the long-standing allegations of human rights abuses, including the killing without trial of people suspected of drugs offences, while Thaksin was the prime minister of Thailand, and of other authoritarian aspects of his rule. He had, though, been consistently popular with a majority of Thais, including the rural poor, until he was overthrown by a military coup in 2006 and corruption proceedings were instigated against him. The military government froze \u00a3900m of his assets before the City deal was done, leading one of the club&apos;s advisers to say that, although enough money was certainly there for Thaksin to buy the club, it was uncertain how much he would have to invest once he had control. None of this baggage deterred the club&apos;s directors or John Wardle and David Makin, the two major shareholders who had, between them, loaned \u00a319.2m to shore City up after previously sanctioning Kevin Keegan&apos;s spending spree. Last June they recommended the club be sold for \u00a321.6m to Thaksin, who would repay Wardle and Makin \u00a317.5m of their loans. The price valued City shares at 40p each, significantly more than their market value at the time but a substantial loss for many City shareholders; in a rights issue back in 1999, with City only just promoted from the third tier, shareholders were asked to invest by buying more shares at 90p. Last year, although back in the Premier League, City had made an \u00a311m loss and owed \u00a368m; they had in December 2006 borrowed \u00a310m against the 2007-08 TV money, season ticket sales were down after a grim season under Stuart Pearce, and so the club were sold for 1/40th of the \u00a3800m the Glazer family paid for Manchester United. Most City fans demonstrated that they had no interest at all in Thaksin&apos;s background or record in Thailand and there was little opposition to the sale. City&apos;s hierarchy reckoned accurately that the fans cared only about seeing the team play better football, and they were won over in three extraordinary weeks which saw Sven-Goran Eriksson appointed as the manager and a dizzying round of signings, orchestrated by the agent Jerome Anderson, including Martin Petrov, Vedran Corluka, Rolando Bianchi, Gelson Fernandes, Javier Garrido, Valeri Bojinov and the Brazilian international Elano who, in particular, lit up City&apos;s remarkably sunny start to the season. Thaksin laid on a free Thai buffet and entertainment in front of Manchester Town Hall and 9,000 City fans were estimated to have accepted that hospitality. At the time, the first two Thaksin Shinawatra clips on YouTube were of the man himself attempting to sing Blue Moon at that jamboree and footage of anti-Thaksin demonstrations in Bangkok from just before the military coup. For City fans, rivalry with United surpasses most worldly concerns and Eriksson&apos;s and Thaksin&apos;s places in the crowd&apos;s affections were secured by February&apos;s second league victory over United, the first double over United for 38 years. The City supporters, kept behind after the 2-1 victory at Old Trafford, found themselves alone in the stadium with Thaksin Shinawatra&apos;s family in the directors&apos; box and got up an ecstatic chorus of: &quot;There&apos;s only one Frank Sinatra&quot;- the nickname the fans gave him because the names sound similar. In modern times, of course, City are cursed to be outdone, so the season they beat United twice ended with United crowned Premier League champions and preparing for the Champions League final while City were losing 8-1 at Middlesbrough and fans calling for Eriksson to be spared were running into trouble with the Riverside stewards. Supporters who did not care to familiarise themselves with Thaksin&apos;s nature are now shocked, horrified, that he has been a little authoritarian in his treatment of their football manager. For those seeking an explanation as to why his discussions with Eriksson at Manchester&apos;s Radisson Edwardian Hotel last month apparently turned so final, the answer appears simply that he expected City to be doing better. One adviser close to Thaksin said the owner had not responded well to Eriksson, a stronger character than he appears publicly, robustly defending his performance. Others advised Thaksin that overall, despite a drop in form since January, City had shown great improvement for a team without a huge squad and with key players, including Micah Richards, out injured. Yet nobody was able to influence Thaksin, who was said to have been incandescent with fury after watching City squander a 2-0 lead against Fulham three weeks ago and lose 3-2. Thaksin is understood to have repeated, with disbelief, that the odds against Fulham doing that were 400-1. In Thailand it was a feature of Thaksin&apos;s political regime that he demanded high performance from his senior staff, called for rapid improvements and regularly sacked ministers after short periods in office. One source at City said Thaksin genuinely wanted the club to succeed and the Thai directors he appointed were serious and keen to learn - the club is proud that its community programme has continued to grow in strength - but that he knew too little about football and believed a manager could be similarly dispensed with and a replacement quickly found. Thaksin has not attended all City matches himself, having been busy fighting off the two corruption charges eventually laid against him and helping the PPP, the political party comprising many former members of his dissolved Thai Rak Thai party, to win the Thai elections. His ownership of City, in a nation hooked on televised Premier League matches, has been a priceless vehicle for buffing his public image and it is apt that the final meetings at which Eriksson is due to learn his fate are expected to take place during City&apos;s tour of Thailand, rather than in Manchester. Thaksin is understood to have told his advisers that Jose Mourinho heads his list of wanted managers; it is not known whether they ventured to quote him odds on the &quot;Special One&quot; choosing City. As for the World Cup winner Luiz Felipe Scolari, he may treat City&apos;s as a welcome first approach as he ponders his next move after managing Portugal in the forthcoming European Championship. Away from Thai politics and business where his writ ran near absolutely, Thaksin will find that, in the wider world of football, managers talk, and gaining a reputation as a sacker of Eriksson may not bode well for tempting a replacement. Nor is it clear whether any new manager will have money to spend. Thaksin has not proved to be the Roman Abramovich-style exotic sugar daddy City fans hoped for when they embraced &quot;Frank&quot; as their club&apos;s owner, with few questions asked. His end-of-season review is expected to include appointing an executive chairman, reportedly Garry Cook from Nike, above the chief executive, Alistair Mackintosh, with a brief to make City a global &quot;brand&quot;. Cook&apos;s first task is likely to be more basic: searching the world for a manager. Hidden costs Thaksin Shinawatra&apos;s reign at Manchester City began in a blaze of signings (seven, including Rolando Bianchi, Javier Garrido, Martin Petrov and Elano, left) with a headline value of \u00a350.6m, but the deals are understood to have been structured to be payable in instalments, so it is not clear how much money Thaksin himself has put into the club.

With agents in overdrive and the transfer window due to open, it&apos;s an absolute bun-fight out there folks. Unconfirmed conjecture and hearsay are flying about like ping-pong balls in a Bangkok bar \u2013 and nearly every single Premier League club is caught in the crossfire. Which makes the Mill&apos;s job a lot easier, it doesn&apos;t mind telling you. Arsenal London&apos;s &quot;too noisy&quot; for wilting wallflower Alexander Hleb so he&apos;s going to Inter where 24-hour honking of moped horns, incessant espresso making and overweight opera singers will no doubt provide the peace and quiet he so desires.

They&apos;re just rumours. Derby County  The Mill knows Derby aren&apos;t Premier League \u2013 and never really were \u2013 but there&apos;s a rumour anyway. Robert Earnshaw, who can eat an apple through a tennis racket, is going to Nottingham Forest for \u00a33.5m which, if you think about it, is fairly absurd.

Instead, something much more interesting is happening in the festival&apos;s lower echelons: four British directors, two of them well-known and two rather less so, have been selected, and while they are all at different stages in their film-making careers, their presence points to a new generation of British cinema beginning to make an impact on the world stage. That two have emerged from the art world can&apos;t be a coincidence. For some years, the YBAs have enthusiastically embraced the medium of film, achieving a kind of breakthrough two years ago when Douglas Gordon&apos;s Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait played at Cannes to considerable acclaim. Though there have been a few misfires (Tracey Emin&apos;s Hot Spot), a new spirit of radicalism has been unleashed. Both Steve McQueen and Sam Taylor-Wood have made their films under the aegis of Film4: if nothing else, they will have succeeded if they can import the glamour of more idea-based work into their cinema. The other two directors have something else in common. Both Thomas Clay and Duane Hopkins know the value of using spectacular photography to underpin stories of moral ambiguity. Clay aroused much hostility with his first film, The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael; his second will hopefully showcase his undoubted film-making abilities. Hopkins is the least known, but his debut Better Things displays tremendous assurance. What unites all four film-makers is a commitment to the high-end art film. In a year when Terence Davies, guru of the more recondite end of British cinema, is back in circulation, it&apos;s a relief to report that his spiritual heirs are making their voices heard. Cannes deserves our thanks for this, at least. Here are our ones to watch this year. The troublemaker: Steve McQueen &quot;When I was in art school, I wanted to be in film school. When I was in film school I wanted to be in art school,&quot; says Steve McQueen, who now comes full circle - an artist taking his film to the world&apos;s biggest film festival. As we speak, French subtitles are being hurriedly added to Hunger, his drama set in the Maze prison during the weeks Bobby Sands and nine other republican prisoners went on hunger strike. Of course, McQueen has made films before. He won the Turner prize in 1999, in part for his video Deadpan, in which he recreated a legendary Buster Keaton stunt, standing still in front of a building as it collapsed around him. He has filmed New York from inside barrels (Drumroll), ventured two miles inside a South African goldmine (Western Deep), and far into the Democratic Republic of Congo (Gravesend). None of them count as features though, which means that Hunger will be in the running for the best first film award. McQueen explains that, when he was 11, he had something like a coming-of-age moment watching the news in spring 1981. There were the hunger strikers and, closer to his home in Ealing, the Brixton riots. A picture of Bobby Sands, the first of the strikers to die, has stuck with him ever since: &quot;It was always in my head, that image.&quot; Hunger will now join an ever-growing canon of films about the Troubles, which have, in recent years, tended towards docu-drama - the urge to lay down history or, in some instances, to correct it. That, McQueen says, is not what he was going for. &quot;I just want to examine what is at stake here. Why would you put yourself on the line in such a way - in the most painful way - for your beliefs? Where have you got to?&quot; He was struck by the idea of the unshakeable convictions of young men (Sands was 27 when he died): &quot;That feeling of youth and the feeling of being right, the feeling of that kind of passion, really.&quot; Does he think the film will be controversial? &quot;It&apos;s called the Troubles for a reason. It&apos;s troubling - it continues to be troubling,&quot; McQueen says. He&apos;s more interested in his audience than the press, and talks with a total and sincere respect about the people who watch his work. For him, films - art or movies, what&apos;s the difference? - act as a mirror. &quot;What gets projected on to the surface of the screen is the audience&apos;s reflection. Do you agree with what Bobby Sands did? If you do, there is always doubt. If you don&apos;t, there is doubt. It&apos;s a difficult thing to think about. And that&apos;s why film-makers should be making films.&quot; Others in the McQueen camp seem more jittery about the film&apos;s likely reception. Ken Loach took a lot of criticism when The Wind That Shakes the Barley won the Palme d&apos;Or in 2006, but Steve McQueen OBE may prove a trickier target. He was the UK&apos;s official war artist in Iraq. (He is still furious that his stamps featuring British soldiers killed in action have not gone into production: &quot;The Royal Mail still haven&apos;t come back to me with a definite answer.&quot;) His films are reflective and resist simplification. The rights and wrongs of the hunger strikers are thrashed out in a moral argument between Sands (Michael Fassbender) and a priest (Liam Cunningham); McQueen likens it to a philosophical game of chess, or a McEnroe/Connors Wimbledon final. Working on Hunger was the first time McQueen had been on a film set, or worked with a crew and actors: was it a difficult leap to make? Last year, he went to the Congo to make a film, he says. &quot;Fifty kilometres into the bush with armed guards.&quot; Hunger was a breeze by comparison. &quot;If you want a cup of tea, some geezer gives you one. Before you finish it, another guy takes it away. What&apos;s there to complain about?&quot; Cath Clarke The wolf in sheep&apos;s clothing: Sam Taylor-Wood Sam Taylor-Wood&apos;s Love You More is a 15-minute tale of first lust, playing in this year&apos;s short film competition and apparently every inch the virginal cheap date. But a glance at the credits reveals its behind-the-scenes firepower: Love You More is funded by Film4, scripted by Patrick Marber, and produced by the late Anthony Minghella. The film takes its cue from a Buzzcocks single and finds room for a brief cameo from the band&apos;s frontman, Pete Shelley. It looms amid the competition as a wolf in sheep&apos;s clothing, a shark among minnows. A Turner prize nominee, Taylor-Wood once conjured an installation out of a sleeping David Beckham and has suspended herself upside down from the ceiling of her east London studio. She explains that Love You More was conceived as a kind of dress rehearsal for her feature debut - an adaptation of a Julie Myerson novel that Minghella planned to produce. Film4 suggested that she try her hand at a short film first, so Marber pitched in with a story, and Seamus McGarvey (Atonement, The Hours) signed on as cinematographer. Taylor-Wood never expected it to be nominated for the short-film Palme d&apos;Or, and has never even visited the festival before. &quot;It&apos;s not the world I&apos;ve inhabited,&quot; she admits. &quot;So I&apos;m coming to it fresh.&quot; This freshness, she says, may well be the ace up her sleeve. Her videos of snoozing celebrities and bowls of rotting fruit have honed her visual sense without burdening her with the usual directorial baggage. &quot;If anything, my background has been a help, not a hindrance,&quot; she says. &quot;It means that I come at film-making from a different angle. It means that I probably construct shots differently to someone who has spent three years in film school. The only problem is that I tend to like to get on with things, whereas film-making is such a slow process.&quot; With a sigh, she explains that Love You More took five whole days to shoot - &quot;even though it&apos;s a film about the energy of a single moment.&quot; One worries that the demands of a feature film will have her climbing the walls with frustration. Not so, says Taylor-Wood. She plans to shoot the Myerson adaptation later this year. &quot;And the whole collaborative process is not something I have any trouble with. My work has always been collaborative. You can&apos;t make films and not love working with people.&quot; As if to prove her point, she breaks off from our conversation to berate the chattering colleagues who have invaded her studio. Keep quiet, she tells them: this is important. &quot;I&apos;m doing an interview about the Palme d&apos;Or!&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;m talking about me!&quot;  Xan Brooks The provocateur: Thomas Clay British critics haven&apos;t been as enthusiastic about Thomas Clay as their continental counterparts. &quot;Horrible and objectionable,&quot; &quot;video-nasty territory&quot; and &quot;a sequence excruciating beyond any in memory&quot; were some of the responses to the bloodcurdlingly violent finale of The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael (2005). Other critics reacted badly to his perceived pretentiousness: his choice of a title, with its echoes of Werner Herzog&apos;s documentary The Great Ecstasy of Woodcarver Steiner, and his nods toward other arthouse film-makers. Three years on, the softly spoken Clay sounds bemused by the outrage he provoked. &quot;I was just trying to make what I felt was a worthwhile a film,&quot; he says, &quot;a film that I myself would want to watch. I didn&apos;t, maybe, anticipate the level of controversy Carmichael seemed to inspire in some places.&quot; He thinks his second feature, Soi Cowboy, will make more comfortable viewing. &quot;I&apos;ll have to wait and see what happens, but it doesn&apos;t contain the same level of graphic violence as Robert Carmichael.&quot; The new film takes its name from a street in Bangkok&apos;s red-light district, and is in two parts. The first half, the writer-director explains, is about a &quot;bar girl and her client, looking at the details of their life together&quot;, shot in the spirit of classic European arthouse cinema - in particular, the work of Clay&apos;s beloved Antonioni. It isn&apos;t, he says, necessarily a study of a white western male exploiting a Thai woman. &quot;It&apos;s not, despite initial appearances, necessarily clear who is exploiting who, and who is complicit in what.&quot; The second half is more &quot;inspired by genre cinema. It&apos;s like a gangster narrative.&quot; Is his British background important to his filmmaking? &quot;Obviously, I was born in England and brought up there. That is always going to be part of my character. At the same time, I try to look wider than that.&quot; Clay&apos;s wife is Thai and he now lives in Thailand. Soi Cowboy was made with a Thai crew, including cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom, who has shot Apichatpong Weerasethakul&apos;s films. &quot;Obviously, I had to be aware of my own perspective, my own possible biases as a foreigner in that environment,&quot; he says. Despite the mixed response to his first film, Clay has fond memories of Cannes and is looking forward to returning. He cites the first festival screening of Robert Carmichael as a special moment: &quot;People in the end weren&apos;t sure how to react, but it was just the experience of showing it. You&apos;ve spent two years working on a film and finally you get to sit there with an audience and see how they respond. That is the moment I will remember.&quot; Geoffrey Macnab The bard of beauty and boredom: Duane Hopkins Of all the Brits in Cannes, Duane Hopkins has had the least help in getting here. A 34-year-old ex-art college student, with just a couple of short films under his belt, Hopkins has come a long way in a short time. He grew up in Chipping Camden in the Cotswolds, and made his first, award-winning short in 2001. Called Field, it set a style and mood that Hopkins has pursued ever since - through a second short (Love Me or Leave Me Alone), and now in his debut feature, Better Things. Hopkins&apos; method is to combine beautifully measured photography of the rural English landscape with simple, almost rudimentary narratives about the disaffected, disconnected teenagers who live there. Boredom and cruelty dominate their world, a counterpoint to the sublime natural beauty all around them. Better Things is, as you would expect, considerably more ambitious thematically than Hopkins&apos;s short films, delving unapologetically into a heroin and pills subculture that Hopkins says was around him as he grew up. &quot;The two things don&apos;t mix in most people&apos;s minds,&quot; he says. &quot;When you think of heroin, you think of inner cities and economic deprivation - but of course you still have all that in the Cotswolds. It&apos;s not the tourist idyll it&apos;s made out to be. Every time I came back to the area I would hear that someone I knew had died through hard drug use. Then my little brother started to tell me the same stories. It was happening in his group of friends as well.&quot; Hopkins&apos;s cinematic response to all this is one of high-minded aestheticism. He is unashamed in his enthusiasm for what he calls &quot;film in its purest form, just images and sound&quot;. &quot;I look at the UK film scene, and think Better Things is quite different - it&apos;s not just about straightforward narrative; it&apos;s trying to investigate the form and do something challenging and innovative. Film can aspire to the same things as painting; it can move into the abstract.&quot; For him, Lynne Ramsay (Ratcatcher) was the trailblazer - &quot;she&apos;s just fantastic&quot; - and he cites a number of other short film-makers and first-feature directors as evidence that something fundamental may be happening. If there is a new generation of British cinema coming to the boil, then Hopkins is very much at its centre.

Few details of the planned mission have emerged. Ban said Sir John Holmes, head of UN humanitarian assistance, would go to Rangoon aboard a World Food Programme flight loaded with aid for the victims of Cyclone Nargis, which struck 13 days ago. The proposed move is a measure of the increasing desperation of the international community forced to largely sit on the sidelines, the vast bulk of the potential aid effort blocked by the regime, steeped in suspicion of outside aid. The UN and aid agencies on the ground in Burma say more aid is getting into the country, but it is as little as a tenth of that required to meet the needs of 2.5 million people affected by the disaster. &quot;There are still tens of thousands who have received no aid,&quot; said Tim Costello, of World Vision in Rangoon. &quot;We&apos;re saving lives. We have to keep working and honour those people who are hanging on.&quot; Like most other aid agencies, World Vision&apos;s international disaster experts still await visas. Its three foreign staff inside the country remotely manage the relief effort from Rangoon, now ringed by roadblocks to prevent them reaching the worst-hit Irrawaddy delta where most of the 128,000 people died. The official death toll reached 43,318 last night. &quot;Around Rangoon there is a political &apos;electric fence&apos;,&quot; said Costello. &quot;To go beyond that you put at risk your whole &apos;in&apos; with the government, so we don&apos;t try. We feel impotent.&quot; Even the aid agencies&apos; Burmese staff working in devastated towns in the delta have been barred by authorities from taking relief to camps and outlying villages. Care International set up a relief station in Pathein manned by national staff helping the thousands who have flooded into makeshift camps in schools. But it has had to resort to delivering aid to the camps and the countryside through ad hoc local organisations that have the authorities&apos; clearance, rather than waste more valuable time awaiting permission. &quot;It&apos;s part of our strategic thinking,&quot; said Brian Agland, Care&apos;s Burma country director. &quot;We&apos;re not going to get in for some time.&quot; Lord Malloch-Brown, UK foreign office minister with responsibility for Asia, held high-level talks in Bangkok yesterday to try to find ways to break the logjam. He met Thailand&apos;s foreign minister, Noppadol Pattama, and prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, who returned a day earlier from fruitless talks with the regime. Malloch-Brown wants to convince the Association of south-east Asian Nations to take the lead to get international disaster experts into Burma. &quot;That&apos;s best not done by ourselves,&quot; he said. &quot;It should be more through ASEAN and the other Asian neighbours to take a strong role with the backing of the international community ... normal diplomatic process will not do. Lives are at stake.&quot; The need became more pressing yesterday as torrential rains in the Irrawaddy delta compounded the misery. Forecasts predicted an expected 12cm over the coming six days, posing an immense threat to destitute survivors. &quot;With soil already saturated, with large areas already flooded, this rain could present the worst case scenario imaginable,&quot; said Peter Rees of the International Red Cross.  The Burmese regime, which went ahead with the constitutional referendum last weekend despite the cyclone, announced that 92.4% of the 22 million eligible voters approved the draft.

The data, based on search, rescue and relief work reported to the national disaster management committee, showed the number of missing had doubled from 27,838 to 55,917. There were an estimated 20,000 people injured. British aid agencies estimate the death toll to be much higher, at about 216,000 or more. The UN and Red Cross say 1.6 million to 2.5 million people are in urgent need of food, water and shelter. The increase in the official death toll came as US officials revealed Burma&apos;s military junta was to take foreign diplomats on a tour of the devastated Irrawaddy delta, raising hopes that intense international criticism of Burma&apos;s relief effort was having some effect. Shari Villarosa, an official at the US embassy in Burma, told Associated Press the country&apos;s foreign ministry was arranging the trip. It is not clear how much access diplomats will have outside of the controlled tour, but it will be the first time foreign officials have been able to see the government&apos;s aid efforts following Cyclone Nargis first-hand. The breakthrough comes after intense pressure on the junta by the UN for blocking attempts by aid agencies to help survivors of the cyclone, which has left up to 2.5 million people homeless and vulnerable to disease. The junta has barred foreign aid experts from going to the delta, saying it is capable of handling the situation on its own. The handful of foreign experts who have been allowed into the country have been restricted to Rangoon, the former capital, and military checkpoints on roads leading out of the city have turned back foreigners. UN officials said Burma&apos;s leaders had left them largely in the dark about the extent of suffering in the country. The generals had failed to provide even the most basic data, including the number of children orphaned, the instances of disease and the situation in refugee camps. &quot;Even the death toll has not been confirmed,&quot; said Steve Marshall, a UN official who has just left Burma. &quot;Everyone is still using a range of figures because we don&apos;t have data yet. Access is making that difficult. We simply don&apos;t have the information, and I can&apos;t say when we will have it.&quot; The risk of outbreaks of disease among survivors &quot;increases with each passing day&quot;, said Amanda Pitt, a UN spokeswoman in Bangkok, Thailand. The junta could not say whether all the survivors were in refugee camps, on the move or still living in destroyed villages in the Irrawaddy delta, the area hit hardest by the cyclone, the UN said. John Holmes, the UN undersecretary general for humanitarian affairs, is due to go to Burma on Sunday to try to convince the generals to grant more access for relief workers and sharply increase aid efforts. The move is a measure of the international community&apos;s increasing desperation at being forced to sit largely on the sidelines as a humanitarian catastrophe unfolds, the vast bulk of its potential relief effort blocked by a regime deeply suspicious of the outside world. The UN and aid agencies on the ground in Burma said more aid was getting to the country, but that it was as little as a tenth of that required to meet the needs of those affected by the disaster. The Burmese prime minister, Thein Sein, was reported on state television saying the emergency phase of the cyclone disaster was over and that the country was now in the rebuilding phase. The UN said this was nonsense, and that there was still a critical need for far more aid. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has not even been able to talk to Senior General Than Shwe, Burma&apos;s military dictator, on the phone. The government said at least 43,318 people were killed and nearly 28,000 went missing when the cyclone hit, turning the low-lying delta into a quagmire of devastated villages and squalid refugee camps. British aid agency estimates put the death toll at 216,000 or more. Outbreaks of potentially life-threatening cholera have been confirmed among the survivors, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said today. But officials said the number of cases was in line with previous years, suggesting there may not be an epidemic of the waterborne disease, as aid agencies had feared. &quot;We do have some confirmed cholera,&quot; said Maureen Birmingham, a WHO representative in Thailand. &quot;We don&apos;t have an explosion of cholera. Thus far the rate of cholera is no greater than the background rate that we would be seeing in Myanmar [Burma] during this season.&quot; She said WHO staff were treating cases of diarrhoea that might be cholera, with antibiotics. The WHO said cholera was endemic in the Irrawaddy delta. There were reports of a cholera outbreak in the region in the days after the cyclone struck. The International Red Cross today warned that a lack of clean water would be the biggest killer in Burma in the coming days.

The club are looking at alternative venues - with Huddersfield Town&apos;s Galpharm Stadium under consideration - amid concerns that the pitch at Eastlands will not be ready in time. City discovered yesterday that they had edged out Fulham as England&apos;s Uefa Cup fair-play representatives and will feature in the first qualifying round of the competition on July 17. That is 25 days after a Bon Jovi concert at the City of Manchester Stadium and leaves the club in a race against time to re-lay and prepare the pitch. There has been no official announcement but City are sounding out other clubs to see where they can play the home leg. Manchester United will not be considered. The club had initially believed there was plenty of time to prepare the pitch before the start of the season but at that stage they had little idea that England would be allowed an extra place in the Uefa Cup. City did not even have the best disciplinary statistics in the Premier League but the five clubs with better records - Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool, United, Arsenal and Everton - have already qualified for Europe. &quot;It&apos;s like the dream came true,&quot; City&apos;s manager, Sven-Goran Eriksson, currently on tour with the team in Bangkok, said last night. &quot;Our dream to play in Europe has been strong all season. At one point we thought we were almost sure to get there, at other points we&apos;ve been almost out of it, but now this news is absolutely fantastic for the club, for the fans and for everyone. &quot;It is a step in the right direction because the target for this club in the future is to play in the Champions League. The Uefa Cup is a very good school to learn about European football. It is a confirmation that we are a good team but also a team that behaves well on the pitch.&quot; Despite his outward happiness, Eriksson is under no illusions that he is unlikely to be around when the draw takes place on June 30. His position has not been discussed during his dealings in the Far East with City&apos;s owner, Thaksin Shinawatra, which have largely been restricted to some awkward photo-shoots and publicity events. However, Eriksson hopes to have a proper meeting with Thaksin after today&apos;s friendly against a Thailand All-Stars team. City, meanwhile, are taking legal advice about reports that Thaksin had put the entire first-team squad up for sale. &quot;There is absolutely no truth to this story or any of the allegations,&quot; said Thaksin.", "publicationDate": "2008-05-16T23:04:48Z", "tags": ["Manchester City", "Europa League", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport", "Bon Jovi"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/may/17/manchestercity.uefa", "title": "City's Uefa Cup plans rocked by Bon Jovi concert", "sentences": ["&quot;It&apos;s like the dream came true,&quot; City&apos;s manager, Sven-Goran Eriksson, currently on tour with the team in Bangkok, said last night."]}, {"article": "The reclusive, xenophobic generals who rule Burma are denying entry to aid workers and disaster specialists trying to reach the areas devastated by Cyclone Nargis. Those who do get visas are normally restricted to the capital, Yangon [Rangoon]. It appears to be the worst-ever case of aid blockage - even trumping the hermit state of North Korea during its famine crisis. Pyongyang did at least allow World Food Programme officials into the country. That is the bad news. The moderately good news, reported by Red Cross and UN agencies, is that the number of aid flights has increased, some aid is reaching the desperate survivors, and that local staff and the Burmese Red Cross staff and volunteers are doing a &quot;heroic job in impossible circumstances.&quot; UN agencies and the EU have held frantic talks to try and persuade the junta to open up Burma to disaster relief specialists. The regime&apos;s response - to ask for more aid, but refuse the accompanying workers entry - is totally unconvincing. They fear US-led aid will lead to the overthrow of their regime, and that prospect alarms them far more than the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Burmese who lack shelter, clean water and adequate food. The junta&apos;s intransigence has forced the UN and the aid community to do some brainstorming about how to deal with the aid obstructions. Many are convinced that the humanitarian imperative and the cause of saving lives should override the sacrosanct conventions of respecting national sovereignty. A Burmese dissident leader in Bangkok, Zaw Min, who is the foreign affairs chief for DPNS (Democratic Party for a New Society) told me: &quot;Countries with planes and ships should push aid into Burma without the consent of the junta. The international community tends to wait for huge number of deaths before acting. World leaders are just waiting for more bad news.&quot; But this is highly unlikely to happen. Only France and the US have suggested imposing humanitarian aid on a regime that is clearly dragging its feet. According to International Red Crescent and International Red Cross, many aid organisations are taking the more feasible option of training Burmese nationals to manage the relief operation and upgrade their skills in disaster management. While the military has hindered other voluntary aid efforts, the local Red Cross teams have managed to get aid to an estimated 500,000 of the 2.5 million extremely needy people. But nobody, excepting the junta, accepts that ad hoc reliance on overworked Burmese local staff of the UN and 20,000 Burmese Red Cross volunteers can substitute for all the expertise, coordination and planning that international staff can provide. The French foreign minister has invoked a UN clause which asserts that the international community has a &quot;responsibility to help protect people from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity when their own government is either unable or unwilling to do so.&quot; If there is a second wave of deaths directly caused by the regime&apos;s deliberate obstruction of international aid, what has come to be known as R2P may apply. It does not authorise military intervention, as many mistakenly believe, but it would assess whether crimes against humanity are being committed through a denial of aid and/or other atrocities. However, the credibility of calls for humanitarian intervention and the UN&apos;s &quot;mandate to protect&quot; have not been helped by their association with Nato&apos;s war in Kosovo and Tony Blair&apos;s attempt to justify the invasion of Iraq on humanitarian grounds. Aggressive anti-junta rhetoric by the US has certainly not helped. A stronger UN consensus depends on aid operations being clearly separated from US politics and the agendas of western powers. Zaw Min agrees that any humanitarian intervention in Burma that sidestepped the generals&apos; sovereignty &quot;should not be led by the US&quot;. Fortunately, other countries also have helicopters and ships. Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and India all have a good number of planes and boats and given their friendly relations with the regime they have more chance than the UN of getting a green light. But they have failed to respond with any sense of urgency. The Asean (Association of South-East Asian Nations) countries that should have taken the lead as a regional organisation will convene their first emergency meeting on Burma on May 19 - 17 days after the cyclone struck. The rich island of Singapore has offered only a miserly $200,000 in aid. Sadly for the suffering and the destitute victims of uncaring regimes, a strong UN-mandate based on a compelling humanitarian consensus is still a long way off.

Eriksson and Thaksin were scheduled to meet after the game at the Rajamangala Stadium to discuss the Swede&apos;s increasingly farcical position at the club, and the mood at that meeting will not have been helped by a limp City performance. Eriksson is already planning for a future away from Eastlands, although he has managed to put on a brave face during the club&apos;s promotional tour of Asia.

Yet it is from Geneva that Dr Supachai Panitchpakdi runs the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad), the agency charged with ensuring that developing countries &apos;integrate into the world economy on an equitable basis&apos;. The irony of his idyllic Alpine base is not lost on the 61-year-old former deputy Prime Minister of Thailand - and neither is the challenge of living up to his brief. Increasing food shortages and rising fuel bills threaten to wipe out fragile economic improvements made by some of the world&apos;s most vulnerable nations. Recent humanitarian catastrophes compound the situation. &apos;The issue is not exaggerated. We need proportionate treatment,&apos; he says in his trademark politically sensitive, occasionally ambiguous, language. &apos;About 10 sub-Saharan economies are suffering from malnutrition all the time.&apos; Panitchpakdi is more likely to be found in a first-class aeroplane seat than at his Swiss base; the past 10 days have seen him not so much globe-trot as gallop. His schedule took him to Accra, Ghana to oversee Unctad&apos;s quadrennial conference of developing nations, back to Geneva, then to New York for the inaugural meeting of the recently constituted UN food security task force with secretary-general Ban Ki-moon. On Wednesday, when we spoke, he was in Geneva before boarding another plane to Tirana in Albania. Panitchpakdi&apos;s immediate challenge is to address the spiralling food prices he believes have been exacerbated by turmoil in the credit markets. He is concerned at how the US sub-prime disaster has contributed to rocketing commodity costs as investors pile out of mortgage securities into wheat, rice and oil.  In the course of our rare interview, he estimates that up to 20 per cent of the rice price increase (it currently stands at about $19 per 100lbs) is down to speculators. Opportunistic financial raiders need to be reined in, he argues, if this latest phase of the commodity boom, driven also by droughts and rising world demand, is not to spark more rioting around the world. India, he says, is considering temporarily closing futures markets in a bid to reduce commodity prices, an agenda he approves of: &apos;There should be measures to regulate and track the futures market.&apos; Cash from high crop prices has not flowed to smallholder farmers: &apos;When you deduct fertilisers, transport and middlemen, farmers are not making gains.&apos; He believes the short-term food crisis will be assuaged by an American grain harvest projected to show a 10 per cent increase on last year&apos;s, and he believes &apos;rice production in Asia will make substantial gains&apos;. But better harvests this year should not allow for any easing in the drive to improve food supplies: &apos;Even if prices come down, we can&apos;t relent, not least because of the rising world population.&apos; Increasing supply, he says, requires a new political and economic philosophy to augment the free market. Powerful global institutions have spent the past two decades laying the ground for market liberalisation. Now the agenda is shifting, Panitchpakdi believes. What&apos;s emerging is &apos;the era of the enabling state&apos;, a drive to make governments the delivery agent for infrastructure improvements, as well as making strategic interventions to catalyse markets that the private sector cannot or does not want to touch. In this way, he argues, economies can help the two billion people who have to survive on less than $2 a day - at least that&apos;s the theory. &apos;The Eighties and Nineties were the decades of liberalisation,&apos; he says. &apos;I would say most work has been directed at making market mechanisms work as best we can. It&apos;s not a 180 degree turn, but what we established at Accra is the era of the enabling state. We don&apos;t want to neglect market developments, but we need to start activating this to help reduce poverty.  &apos;More incentives. More agriculture. We need the public sector; the private sector doesn&apos;t do this. In Accra we established a new wave of globalisation with a human face. What we are now dealing with is climate change, migration and the means of getting involved with smaller players.&apos;  To put that into practice, Panitchpakdi is proposing major investment in modern farm technology in the way that many Asian countries have successfully started to do. This needs to be transferred to African nations.  &apos;I say we need to provide humanitarian assistance that has durable solutions to food security,&apos; he adds. &apos;We need to spend much more effort on agriculture. As we can see, this has been neglected in the past two decades.&apos; At Accra, Panitchpakdi launched the World Investment Forum, which, for the first time, saw African leaders and more than 100 chief executives from the world&apos;s top companies meet to improve investment opportunities. A second conference is now scheduled in two years. It is on this agenda that the secretary-general and the organisation he leads face charges from some influential quarters that Unctad is freezing out representatives of civil society and is an irrelevance to poverty alleviation as it &apos;panders&apos; increasingly to big business. Panitchpakdi calls such talk naive and says big business is one of the main forces through which economic transformation will be made. But he is conscious that the architects of the global economy have done little to help smallholders who, in the developing world, constitute the largest grouping but the most deprived economic force. Linked to spiralling food costs are the huge trade-distorting subsidies doled out to European and American farmers which have lowered the supply of crops in emerging economies. Panitchpakdi, who, as former director-general of the World Trade Organisation, knows more than most about the intricacies of the multilateral trading system, is all for subsidies that encourage farmers to improve the environment or aid research: &apos;Of course we have to give real incentives to farmers.&apos; It is the European Union&apos;s Common Agricultural Policy and the billion-dollar cheques written out to US farmers that need urgent fixing. The refusal of the EU and US to do this unless they were granted access to emerging economies&apos; markets was the main reason for the virtual collapse of the last major trade talks - the Doha round, which was supposed to be &apos;pro poor&apos;.  The current high food prices, which are not cyclical but a &apos;long-term shift&apos;, provide an opportunity, says Panitchpakdi, to make real progress on finally forging a world trade deal. &apos;Because of this, negotiators should be under less pressure to protect their subsidies.&apos; Most commentators believe that President George Bush will not risk the wrath of largely Republican American farmers in an election year by ditching his generous cash support for them. But Panitchpakdi is not so sure: &apos;It&apos;s in the common interest to reduce budget deficits. That could be derived from subsidy reduction so the dollar can be stabilised. &apos;The dollar&apos;s movement might have too much impact on energy and food prices. To get to this situation will be in their interest. I think the US administration sees it that way and the Americans are doing a lot to seek a solution.&apos; Panitchpakdi&apos;s stance on China&apos;s engagement with Africa is fascinating. Through his eyes, it is possible to see China as a far more progressive customer of African oil and minerals than both Europe and the US. &apos;They are more responsive to the requirement of Africans,&apos; he says. With Chinese petro- and copper dollars comes much-needed infrastructure - no questions asked. Panitchpakdi identifies a host of oil-rich African nations that are doing well from the commodity boom. He is encouraged that Nigeria is starting a fund to invest in economic diversification while northern African states are enjoying healthy budget surpluses. At the same time, he is concerned that commitments to write off the debts of poor countries by rich nations made at Gleneagles three years ago have replaced additional promises of increased aid. That aside, the rise of the new south will be the defining factor in the future of capitalism, he believes. &apos;We are talking of a situation in which a third of the world&apos;s export markets will be developing countries. Western companies will need to take notice of the weight and implication of companies coming from the south.&apos; The CV Name Supachai Panitchpakdi Born Bangkok, 1946 Education MA in econometrics and development planning and PhD in economic planning and development at Netherlands School of Economics.

Lord Malloch-Brown, a foreign minister with responsibility for Asia, said after talks with Burmese ministers in Rangoon that there had been a turning point that would shortly enable the delivery of more aid, with Asian countries taking the lead. The glimmer of hope two weeks after Cyclone Nargis struck killing an estimated 128,000 people came as the UN&apos;s head of humanitarian affairs, Sir John Holmes, arrived in Rangoon last night for three-day talks on speeding up the dismally slow aid effort hamstrung by Burma&apos;s generals. Holmes is due to tour the worst-hit areas in the Irrawaddy delta ahead of the arrival of the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, in Burma later this week to coincide with a donor pledging conference in Bangkok slated for Saturday. Already the British-based charity Save the Children says that some children under five may have died from starvation as they await relief, and thousands more could be at risk in the coming weeks. The latest UN assessment of the situation in the Irrawaddy delta estimates that just 20% of as many as 2.5 million people gravely affected by the disaster have so far been reached with aid. The official toll of dead and missing has risen to 133,653, while the number of injured has leapt from 1,403 to 19,359. Burma&apos;s leader, General Than Shwe, made his first visit to cyclone survivors in camps on the outskirts of Rangoon. Relief supplies are only trickling into the country. The UN World Food Programme said it had distributed enough rice, beans and high energy biscuits for 212,000 people, about a third of those thought to be in the most desperate need. The UN and aid agencies reiterated their alarm that the amounts of aid were insufficient and too slow in arriving even as the diplomatic dance with the generals goes on and the warnings of a second man-made catastrophe grow more urgent. Amid concern about a &quot;second wave&quot; of death brought about by hunger and disease, Save the Children warned that thousands of the most vulnerable children under five could starve to death in the coming weeks. It identified 30,000 malnourished youngsters in the Irrawaddy delta even before the cyclone. &quot;With hundreds of thousands of people still not receiving aid many of these children will not survive much longer,&quot; said Save the Children. &quot;Children may already be dying as a result of a lack of food.&quot; Burmese charities supported by Christian Aid have already discovered children and the elderly dying in villages in the Irrawaddy delta that have received no aid, or help to provide clean water, 15 days into the tragedy. &quot;The Burmese authorities are allowing our partner organisation to distribute water and water purification tablets,&quot; said a Christian Aid worker in Rangoon. &quot;The villagers have dysentery and are dying. In one, some young children and a 70-year-old man died.&quot; Malloch-Brown offered some hope that help might be at hand after meeting four Burmese ministers.  The minister passed on a letter from the prime minister, Gordon Brown, who had warned that the natural disaster was in danger of becoming a man-made catastrophe because of the regime&apos;s &quot;inhuman&quot; foot-dragging. &quot;I delivered to them a letter for the senior leader Than Shwe from Gordon Brown insisting that this was a humanitarian enterprise and that we put politics aside to help the victims of the cyclone,&quot; said Malloch-Brown. &quot;I think they are responding in kind to this on the terms we are offering it.&quot; He said he was &quot;confident&quot; that the Burmese had agreed to a diplomatic compromise that could resolve the impasse to get substantial amounts of relief into the country under the supervision of Asian countries, rather than the western countries that the regime views with suspicion. &quot;We found a middle ground,&quot; he said. &quot;Through the leadership of Asian neighbours, India and China and Asean [the Association of South-east Asian Nations] countries like Thailand and Indonesia, in partnership with the UN, there is now a leadership which the Burmese can accept and we can work through to deliver aid.&quot; Despite his cautious optimism, Malloch-Brown acknowledged it was coming &quot;incredibly late in the day&quot; and accepted that Burma&apos;s suspicion would ensure that far fewer foreign aid workers would be involved than had been seen in comparable disasters in Asia. Foreign ministers from the 10 Asean countries, including Burma, are due to hold an emergency meeting today in Singapore to discuss their response to the disaster.

The outbreak of bickering between the three major UK television news providers over their coverage of the cyclone in Burma and the Chinese earthquake may be a sign that the competitive pressures in covering the two disasters in difficult conditions are starting to show. TV news budgets are also being strained by the two Asian disasters, together with the longer than expected US Democratic presidential primary process, and recent crises in Zimbabwe and Lebanon, with warnings that smaller stories later in the year might suffer as a result. In an internal staff email, seen by MediaGuardian.co.uk, veteran news executive Mannion said ITV News&apos; coverage of the Chinese earthquake had &quot;comprehensively&quot; beaten the BBC, while the corporation and Sky News had been left &quot;floundering&quot; in covering the Burmese cyclone. &quot;The brilliant and rapid reactions of the foreign desk coupled by the extraordinary endeavour and bravery of the team in Burma left not only the BBC and Sky floundering; it produced the only first-hand television account of events in that closed country,&quot; he added. &quot;Once again we comprehensively beat the BBC [on the Chinese earthquake], despite their huge resources and the numbers they have in Beijing. Sky too were unable to match us for both speed of response and quality of work.  &quot;Our partner news broadcasters around the world have been fulsome in their praise, as has ITV&apos;s new programme boss Peter Fincham.&quot; ITV News correspondent Neil Connery reported from inside Burma from May 7 to last Thursday, May 15, when he flew to Bangkok. The broadcaster&apos;s China correspondent, John Ray, and his team are reporting on the earthquake.  The international editor, Bill Neely, and his crew are also in China for ITV News, which is supplied by ITN. However, the BBC&apos;s world news editor, Jon Williams, refuted Mannion&apos;s allegations, although he also praised ITV&apos;s coverage. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t say we have been floundering. I am quite happy with what we have done,&quot; Williams said. &quot;We were in Burma before ITV got there, but their coverage has been nothing less than impressive. It is that sense of competition that is good for the audience,&quot; he added. However, sources say that questions have been raised internally within the BBC over its coverage of the disasters, although a spokesman denied this amounted to any sort of formal review. &quot;We assess coverage every day, but this does not equate to a review,&quot; he said. The BBC has also been stymied by having two of its correspondents - Andrew Harding and Paul Danahar - deported by the Burmese authorities.  An on-air apology also had to be issued by the BBC on Friday after it mistakenly used a still photograph of the 2004 Asian tsunami before a report about the Burmese cyclone during Thursday night&apos;s 10pm news on BBC1. The BBC spokesman said the corporation currently had &quot;small undercover teams&quot; in Burma, while in China its Beijing bureau team - James Reynolds, Michael Bristow, Dan Griffiths and Paul Danahar - has been covering the earthquake. Williams said he wanted to get more people into both Burma and China but visa restrictions meant it was difficult. Meanwhile, on the BBC news website&apos;s editors&apos; blog, Williams also seemed to criticise Sky News for some of its coverage of the Burmese cyclone. &quot;A number of reporters are also operating inside Burma. But don&apos;t believe everything you see on television!&quot; he wrote. &quot;While the BBC and most other UK broadcasters are reporting from Rangoon or the Irrawaddy delta, this weekend one news channel set foot across the Thai border, many hundreds of miles away from the areas worst hit by the cyclone, and claimed to be reporting from &apos;inside Burma&apos;,&quot; Williams added. &quot;It&apos;s not a lie - but it is misleading. Burma is a big place - &apos;day-trippers&apos; are allowed to go to some tourist parts of the country. But it doesn&apos;t equip those who travel there to comment on what&apos;s going on elsewhere. The truth is not always as it appears.&quot; A BBC source later confirmed that Williams was referring to a Sky News report on May 10.  A Sky spokeswoman declined to comment on Williams&apos;s allegation. But she said the broadcaster was covering the two disasters with two correspondents in China - Peter Sharp and David Bowden - while it also had a reporter and producer on the ground in Burma, although she declined to name them for security reasons. The costs of covering the two disasters are putting strains on the budgets of all the UK&apos;s main news broadcasters. &quot;This stuff is expensive, but that is the business we are in,&quot; Williams said. &quot;We are not not spending money, we are throwing money at these stories. If we have to make some difficult choices later in the year about the smaller stories that is an issue we will return to.&quot; \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.

Shortly after touching down in Rangoon, he visited the country&apos;s most sacred shrine, the gilded Shwedagon Pagoda, where he laid flowers in memory of victims of the cyclone. The secretary general donated money for survivors and told trustees that he was bringing &quot;a message of hope&quot; for the 2.4 million people left destitute. &quot;I am confident we will be able to overcome this tragedy,&quot; he said. &quot;At the same time, I hope [the] government can coordinate the flow of aid so the aid work can be done in a more systematic and organised way.&quot; Ban said only a quarter of those needing help had been reached after a disaster the Burmese authorities have acknowledged is unprecedented. Twenty days after the cyclone struck, Ban was taken on a four-hour helicopter tour of the Irrawaddy delta, the area hit hardest by the storm. The disaster is believed to have killed as many as 134,000 people. The official toll stands at 77,738 dead and 55,917 missing. After visiting the village of Kyondah, where he spoke with some of the 500 people huddled in blue tents, Ban said: &quot;I&apos;m very upset by what I&apos;ve seen.&quot; The settlement, which has electricity and clean water, was selected for visits by senior junta members and representatives of international aid organisations last week.

Naturally, much aid and goodwill is pouring into the region. It&apos;s been heartbreaking to watch parents who lost their children, and children surviving their parents killed in the quake. But little is known about another group of children in China: kids who have lost their mothers not to a natural disaster, but to the blanket enforcement of a Chinese policy, with no attention from local or international media. Take Sun Hwa (not her real name), a seven-year old girl, for example. She was born in China, to a Chinese father and a North Korean mother. Under Chinese law, she is entitled to Chinese nationality at birth. But it wasn&apos;t until a few months ago that she was registered under the Chinese household registration system or hukou. Sun Hwa&apos;s father had faced two terrible options: registering her at the risk of exposing her North Korean mother, who could then be arrested and repatriated, or not registering her, and thus denying his daughter a legal identity and legal access to education. The concerns faced by Sun Hwa&apos;s parents are not unfounded. For years, China has been arresting and summarily repatriating many North Korean women living with Chinese men, including those with children. To save children like Sun Hwa from a likely lifelong separation from their mothers, the Chinese government doesn&apos;t need to send food aid or firefighters to their rescue. It does not even need to change its laws. In fact, all it has to do is to respect its own laws on nationality and education, and the international treaties it ratified. Ironically, the choice for Sun Hwa&apos;s family became somewhat easier when rumours started of massive crackdowns against North Korean refugees. &quot;People said the police would come and get all North Koreans before the (Beijing) Olympic Games,&quot; Sun Hwa&apos;s father, a 36-year-old farmer, said. &quot;We decided it&apos;s best for the child&apos;s mother to leave.&quot; The last time he heard from her, in October 2007, Sun Hwa&apos;s mother told him she was in Bangkok, waiting to reach South Korea as an asylum seeker. He promptly registered his daughter on his hukou. Most of these North Korean women like Sun Hwa&apos;s mother escaped a famine at home that killed about one million people, or about 5 percent of the population, in the 1990s. Once in China, some of these women formed relationships with Chinese men voluntarily, while others did so as victims of trafficking. The Yanbian area of China&apos;s eastern Jilin province, which borders North Korea, suffers from a serious gender imbalance, thanks to an exodus of local women seeking better-paying jobs elsewhere, creating a demand for the North Korean women as wives and farm workers. The Chinese government insists they are economic migrants, but leaving North Korea without state permission is a crime, at times considered an act of treason, which carries heavy penalties. North Koreans who are repatriated are subjected to harsh interrogation, mistreatment, and sometimes torture, followed by lengthy terms in prison and forced labour. This serious risk of persecution means many North Koreans in China are refugees, and China, as a state party to the 1951 Refugee Convention, has an obligation to offer them shelter and protection. The deportation of such women not only violates China&apos;s international legal obligations towards them as refugees, but forcibly separates children from their mothers, often never to see each other again. Chinese laws state that all children are entitled to nine years of free, mandatory education regardless of the child&apos;s legal status. In reality, schools demand hukou verification for entry and continued schooling. In the case of children born in North Korea living in China, they have little hope of ever being registered since they have no claims to Chinese nationality. &quot;There are two things I pray for - for my son to have hukou, and for me not to be repatriated,&quot; a 39-year old woman from North Korea said, echoing the words of many like her in China. Her wishes are humble. And it is in the interest of the Chinese government to grant them. Nobody wins by separating children from their mothers, or by denying them legal identity and education.", "publicationDate": "2008-05-23T17:30:00Z", "tags": ["China", "North Korea", "Politics", "Children", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/23/unusualcruelty", "title": "Unusual cruelty", "sentences": ["&quot;We decided it&apos;s best for the child&apos;s mother to leave.&quot; The last time he heard from her, in October 2007, Sun Hwa&apos;s mother told him she was in Bangkok, waiting to reach South Korea as an asylum seeker."]}, {"article": "When Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull hits our screens this week, we can be sure of one thing: it will be quite unlike any other Indiana Jones movie.

A year ago, eBay customers were bidding \u00a3200 for an Anya Hindmarch &apos;I&apos;m Not a Plastic Bag&apos; eco-bag, with &apos;We Are What We Do&apos; written on the inside, even though they knew it had just cost the eco-seller \u00a35 from Sainsbury&apos;s. Today, that exact same &apos;I&apos;m Not a Plastic Bag&apos; bag brand new(ish), with tags, may be had for around half that or less, although inevitably there are rumours that some of these cheaper &apos;I&apos;m Not a Plastic Bag&apos; bags are in fact cynical, if hard-to-spot, copies, good for absolutely nothing but carrying groceries home in. But consumer fear of being sold a fake (tip: watch out for zips and deformed apostrophes) cannot explain entirely the plummeting value of this once-sacred tote. The credit crunch is already known to have had an impact on bag fever. And one which is likely to be exaggerated when the bag in question is, like the INAPB, so plainly last year&apos;s model. (Of many new and attractive fair trade options, one is made, according to the Ethical Superstore, &apos;by a co-operative in Bangkok from 100 per cent recycled grain sacks&apos;.) But Anya prices might also have suffered from widespread consumer disillusion. Some ethical shoppers are minded, apparently, to return bags which have conspicuously failed, even after a whole year of regular use, to save the world. When the INAPB was introduced by an organisation called We Are What We Do, many bag devotees clearly believed that it might not be beyond a truly special tote to succeed - where Al Gore, James Lovelock and the Smythson&apos;s Nancy Bag have so far struggled - in accomplishing &apos;small changes and big differences&apos;. One scholar, from think-tank Ekklesia, drew a parallel between this practical bag-engagement and Diognetus&apos;s doctrine of praxis. Hymning the bag after it appeared on the arm of Keira Knightley, the Sun newspaper told readers: &apos;Being green has never been more cool.&apos; It would be unfair, of course, to blame the bag alone for the notably tepid interest in saving the planet recently expressed in a survey conducted by Opinium Research. Something else must explain why, after years of environmental consciousness-raising, supported by an increasingly unanimous scientific community whose chilling prognostications are now regularly proclaimed by everyone from George Monbiot to Nicholas Stern, 72 per cent of the population said they did not want to pay any green taxes. Almost as many thought the green agenda has been hijacked by the government as a dodge for raising taxes. On the other hand, researchers found the public is not suffering from a comprehensive ethical breakdown. The great majority of consumers, some 94 per cent, revealed some awareness of what Lovelock has called &apos;the ineluctable consequences of destruction&apos;, and therefore &apos;aim to behave in an environmentally friendly manner themselves&apos;. An understandable approach when you think how many times politicians, eager to delegate an unpopular task, have reminded the public that with climate change, every little really and truly helps.  &apos;Each of us can make a difference,&apos; Gordon Brown likes to drone, without ever saying what he has in mind. Should we be hanging 4x4 drivers from their own bull bars? Or taking cold showers, maybe once a week, just to show China we mean business?  No one would deny, however, that the personal, praxis-based approach to tackling climate change has made a difference. Without it, there would be, for instance, no fair trade fashion, no eco-jewellery made by peasant collectives, none of the magazines and websites where concerned consumers can find out how to save the planet in ways that won&apos;t involve politics or membership of some austere group such as Friends of the Earth with its Big Ask.  Why not start, instead, with a really weeny ask, then work up? Something like Ethical Living magazine&apos;s poser of the month: &apos;Is your sex appeal sustainable?&apos; No? Then invest in some new &apos;ethical undies&apos;. Though there are many cheaper expressions of virtue. Pesticide-free tampons, for instance. Every little helps. Even when that little would be, outside this strictly ethical context, an exercise in supremely fatuous self-regard.  A website called Do the Green Thing applauds the most microscopic acts of altruism. Such as walking (&apos;whenever possible&apos;). Its latest proposal is &apos;Stick With What You&apos;ve Got&apos;. &apos;Buying too much stuff puts an insane strain on the environment.&apos; That sticking with what you&apos;ve got and, indeed, with where you are should be so much less challenging during an economic slowdown has led some greens to welcome the prospect of recession, since a collapse in growth would inevitably slow energy consumption. This turns out to be a dream shared by that nice Michael O&apos;Leary from Ryanair. &apos;In many ways, we would welcome a chill or something even colder,&apos; he said recently. &apos;We would welcome a good, deep, bloody recession in this country for 12 to 18 months. It would help see off the environmental nonsense that has become so popular among the chattering classes.&apos;  A somewhat graceless comment, perhaps, given the broadmindedness that has allowed these same chattering classes to continue to use O&apos;Leary&apos;s airline for their European mini-breaks, no matter what the cost to their most cherished principles. This liberal attitude may also explain why holiday companies can still boast of being, possibly unlike ethical living, recession-proof. We are what we do. The piercing wisdom of the Anya Hindmarch bag in relation, at least, to middle-class green consumers is confirmed yet again by new figures showing a decline in sales of organic food and, outside the home, by a general apathy in the face of Heathrow&apos;s third runway and the exclusion of airline emissions from the watery I&apos;m Not a Climate Change Bill. Events in Crewe and Nantwich illustrate the difficulties of politicians intent on doing anything, such as carbon-taxing to avert catastrophe since a) no one really believes it&apos;s coming, b) they&apos;ll be dead anyway, c) the recession has left them much too fearful and poor to care, and d) they won&apos;t vote for anyone who tries to make them. So Brown won&apos;t make himself more unpopular by reducing airline emissions or introducing personal carbon allowances. Neither he nor Cameron nor Clegg will, to their collective shame, unite behind an effective carbon policy which, appearing identically in every manifesto like the nasty nougat in every box of chocolates, may put the interests of future generations before contemporary self-pity. And when Cameron, versatile friend of both glacier and motorist, finally prevails, his strategy for &apos;green growth&apos; has as much chance of holding back the rising seas as did the Anya Hindmarch bag. And fair play to the bag: at least you could carry stuff in it.", "publicationDate": "2008-05-24T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Green politics", "Ethical and green living", "Environment", "Politics"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/25/greenpolitics.ethicalliving", "title": "Catherine Bennett: Green politics, like all fashions, has proved sadly transient", "sentences": ["(Of many new and attractive fair trade options, one is made, according to the Ethical Superstore, &apos;by a co-operative in Bangkok from 100 per cent recycled grain sacks&apos;.)"]}, {"article": "Thailand&apos;s most senior military commander yesterday refused to rule out a fresh coup, five months after elections restored democracy.

Every year they say this has been done and every year I turn up at the airport to find that there&apos;s nothing for me to eat. This year I will be travelling from Glasgow to Saigon, which will involve three flights - rather a long time to go without even a plane meal. Glasgow to/from London will be with BA, and Heathrow to Bangkok, then Bangkok to Saigon will be with Thai Airways. Do you have any advice?Jane Wood, by email As an avowed carnivore, I asked my long-veggie brother if he had the same problem as you and he reeled off a long list of delicious meals he&apos;s been served on planes. So your question is baffling - either your agent is consistently inept or you are very unfortunate. First things first: double-check that your agent has placed this request. This is straightforward and if not done at the time of booking can be done before you fly. Or do it yourself. If you have a reference number for your booking with British Airways, you can use this at www.ba.com to request a special meal. You can also do it by phone on 0844 493 0787. With Thai Airways you can reserve your meal by calling their reservations line on 0870 606 0911. Confirm your requirements at check-in, and with a member of the cabin crew. Even after all this mistakes can be made, but this will minimise your chances of going hungry.My husband, myself and our 12-year-old son have been living in Ireland for nearly three years. We came to Dublin for my husband&apos;s job from Melbourne, Australia. My son and I will be returning to Australia to live in Western Victoria later this year (probably September/October) while my husband will remain in Dublin for at least another year.  Do you have any suggestions as to an interesting way to see a few different countries en route to Australia. A slow boat to China? Train to Russia? We are open to any combination of travel, so what is the best way to get from one side of the world to the other while enjoying the in-between? Is there anything that is a happy medium between a cruise ship and a container ship? What would you do?Jayne Irvine, Dublin I feel duty-bound to remove some of the mystique from this journey. Wonderful as it sounds, an overland journey will be much more expensive than flying, and will require a lot of upfront planning. In particular, your son may be bored to tears by 10 days on a train trundling through Siberian forests. And even if you can get on a ship from Asia to Australia, the sea passage in particular will be another long journey for you both with few distractions.  As there&apos;s no &apos;happy medium&apos; between cargo vessel and cruise - and availability on the former often requires reservations up to 12 months in advance - my suggestion is to tackle a chunk of the route overland, say to Beijing or Hong Kong. Make your way as you please across Europe into Russia, then take the train east into China. Taking a month or six weeks over the journey will keep everything moving fast and you can fly, or go by boat, to Australia from there.

The fresh lese-majesty complaint made by the police lieutenant-colonel, who claimed to be acting in a private capacity, accused the south-east Asia correspondent Jonathan Head of criticising the monarchy. But in a statement the BBC said the charges, which accused Head of being part of anti-monarchy &quot;conspiracy&quot; involving the deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, were groundless. Thailand&apos;s lese-majesty laws are among the toughest in the world, carrying a prison term of up to 15 years. But because anyone can file a complaint, they are often misused for ulterior, political motives. Last week cabinet minister Jakrapob Penkair was forced to step down after police decided to press formal charges on a complaint made by the officer, Watanasak Mungkijakandee, who filed the allegations against Head. In April, Watanasak filed a lese-majesty complaint against Head for remarks he made while moderating a discussion &quot;Coup, Capital and Crown&quot; at Bangkok&apos;s Foreign Correspondents&apos; Club six months ago. Police are still investigating its merit. But Watanasak made new and more wide-ranging allegations against Head last Friday, citing that his reporting between 2006 and 2008 had &quot;damaged and insulted the monarchy&quot;. In support of his complaint he submitted 11 articles from the BBC website - some not written by Head - and a picture of the correspondent shaking hands with Thaksin ahead of a 2001 interview. The policeman maintained in his submission that this showed Head was &quot;very close&quot; to Thaksin, who lacked &quot;loyalty to the royal institution&quot;.  In fact, Head&apos;s reporting often mentioned the corruption allegations swirling around the former prime minister ousted in the 2006 coup. &quot;The allegations made against Jonathan Head are completely unfounded,&quot; said the BBC South Asia bureau editor, Paul Danahar, in statement. &quot;The BBC understands that the police in Thailand are required to investigate all complaints of lese-majesty and will cooperate with that investigation.  &quot;But it is very upsetting that his work should be incorrectly presented in this way and it has caused great distress to both him and his family.&quot; \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.

Hughes yesterday held extensive talks with City which continued in London into the evening, when the club hoped to agree terms on a four-year contract. Hughes received a ringing public endorsement from Thaksin, the City owner, who made the appointment sound a certainty. &quot;He&apos;s an outstanding manager who has achieved many things with Blackburn,&quot; Thaksin said from Bangkok. &quot;Mark was always the first choice of our new executive chairman, Garry Cook. Together they will make a great team. They will both prove to be excellent acquisitions, I&apos;m sure. These are exciting times for Manchester City and I hope the supporters can understand that I share their goals. &quot;That sometimes means making ruthless decisions. Now we can go forward to a new era with a new management structure and great hope and ambition.&quot; Thaksin was sure that Hughes would succeed Sven-Goran Eriksson even though a vacancy remains at Chelsea, where Hughes is on the shortlist. He seemed convinced the former Manchester United forward would not delay giving them an answer in the hope of being turned to by Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea owner. A compensation package has been agreed between City and Blackburn and Hughes has informed the club of the players he would like to sign. His first target would be Blackburn&apos;s England midfielder David Bentley, although it is not thought Roque Santa Cruz figures on the list at a time when City have secured a deal, close to \u00a320m, to sign Jo, the Brazilian striker, from CSKA Moscow. Thaksin and his associates, chief among them the increasingly influential agent Kia Joorabchian, have also not given up on Ronaldinho and a delegation from City hopes to meet the former world player of the year in Brazil this weekend.  The priority, however, is to confirm a successor to Eriksson, who was last night confirmed as Mexico&apos;s head coach. The arrival of Hughes would also lead to the arrival of four members of his backroom staff - Mark Bowen, Glyn Hodges, Kevin Hitchcock and Eddie Niedzwiecki. The appointment of all five would cost Thaksin about \u00a35m in compensation and Eriksson, whose sacking was confirmed on Monday, will receive a pay-off of \u00a31.5m. The former England head coach was initially due \u00a31m but is entitled to a \u00a3500,000 bonus because of City&apos;s qualification for the Uefa Cup, albeit for finishing sixth in the Fair Play League. &quot;The deal with Sven is amicable, it is friendly,&quot; he told the Daily Mail. &quot;We&apos;ve agreed to the bonus because he deserves it. He did take us into Europe. We must respect him for that. Now he has a new job and I wish him well. We wish him well.&quot; Eriksson&apos;s appointment with Mexico was made after the owners of the country&apos;s 18 top-flight teams unanimously approved him. Eriksson, speaking in Spanish, said: &quot;I accepted because it is a big challenge. Mexico is a big country. Our goal, everybody&apos;s goal, is to play in the World Cup in 2010.&quot; Meanwhile Blackburn are considering replacements for Hughes. Sam Allardyce, who has been out of the game since his sacking by Newcastle in January, has let it be known he would relish the opportunity to revive his career at Ewood Park but the club intend to explore other possibilities. Those likely to be considered include the former England manager Steve McClaren, Celtic&apos;s Gordon Strachan and Zenit St Petersburg&apos;s Uefa Cup-winning coach, Dick Advocaat.

She co-curated the Freeze exhibition that launched the YBAs on to an unexpecting British public and found fame as a result.

Her ability to negotiate both art and fashion led Tom Chapman at Matches, the high-fashion boutique, to invite her to create an installation for their new Marylebone Street store.

His paintings and prints appear to have emulated something of the early Renaissance master&apos;s spatial elegance and almost theatrical momentousness. Chambers&apos; works are metaphorical, moments taken out of time and defying gravity.

Taking her cue from Degas, Granstr\u00f6m&apos;s semi-naked women are glimpsed as they wash each other&apos;s backs and climb into stockings.

The title of Francis Al\u00ffs&apos;s piece, Sometimes Doing Something Poetic Can Become Political And Sometimes Doing Something Political Can Become Poetic, indicates the often oblique perspectives taken by the seven international contemporary artists in posing artistic questions while positing no clear-cut cultural answers. Lidwien van de Ven&apos;s photographic installation presents a series of deceptively muted images that are resonant with historical traces and present disquiet, and Yael Bartana&apos;s video installation Wild Seeds (pictured) blurs game-playing with reality and represents the effect of environment on behaviour.

Unlike the surrealists, Aldworth has taken a more forensic approach to this phenomenon, working in collaboration with doctors, neuroscientists and neurophysiologists, as well as musicians and other artists.

Did anyone taking a gap year ever discover the meaning of life? Did they ever go on to win a Nobel prize? Did they heck. Before they knew it, their gap year had changed into gap years, soon to become a gap lifetime. The television company Endemol is very good at paying lazy people to do nothing, as yet another Big Brother (the ninth) bears witness. The world is never short of volunteers to drop out of normal life in the pursuit of fame, and now, in conjunction with the website Bebo, the company has found yet another vehicle featuring people being paid not to work. The Gap Year, which launched on May 21 on Bebo, has given six young people from different countries an all-expenses-paid, six-month trip to pastures new. Although dubbed &quot;explorers&quot; on the website, think less Ranulph Fiennes and more the EastEnders planning a trip up west for the night. There are photos, blogs and videos on the individual profile pages, and already a substantial fan-base is building. So, who are these &quot;explorers&quot;? The site calls them &quot;intrepid&quot;, which, according to the thesaurus, means adventurous, bodacious, bold, brave, daring, doughty, fearless, gallant, game, gutsy, heroic, nervy, resolute, vigilant. Let&apos;s be honest, they can&apos;t and won&apos;t be: not least, because you can&apos;t be any of those things when there is a camera crew constantly at your heels and a production manager insisting that everyone stick to the terms of the insurance. The drama, therefore, has to be imposed from without, under very controlled circumstances, and as a result is, so far, rather dull. Cara Cloni is the one you most want to slap. An American, for her, the trip is &quot;awesome&quot; and, as a woman whose profile states that she likes all things Disney, she must really mean it. Cara is loud. Very loud. Just when you thought she was at her loudest when being greeted by a goat called Satan, she was taken shark diving and screamed even more. Fearless? Gutsy? Not really. Seen it all before. Got the T-shirt. That is The Gap Year&apos;s real problem: most things, so far, we have seen thousands of times before. The footage is bog-standard travel stuff - cars streaming up a hot street, sharks under water, miles of salt flats - and the six characters do not deliver enough to add a new dimension to the familiar material. The under-reaction of most of the six is indicative of a world in which the young can have pretty much anything they want and go anywhere they choose; hence, there is precious little feeling of adventure or excitement as this mob set about their travels. Andre Tardiff was distinctly low-key about the considerable attention he was getting from girls in a Bangkok bar, and no amount of prompting from what I presume was the cameraman was going to drag the slightest sense of wonder out of him. He did nothing, he said, because &quot;I&apos;m Canadian&quot;. &quot;What does that mean?&quot; asked the cameraman. &quot;We&apos;re pure. With integrity.&quot; Bloody hell, he&apos;s going to be great TV. I was hoping for something more from Australian Amy O&apos;Connor, who we see touching snow for the first time. Describing herself as &quot;vivacious, ambitious, fun&quot;, she said her time in Iceland was &quot;a beautiful experience&quot;, &quot;awesome&quot;, &quot;amazing&quot;. Clearly auditions for The Gap Year were not quite as rigorous as those for Big Brother. There are a couple of shining lights in among the tedium, in particular 18-year-old Londoner David Brett, who has a natural ease in front of the camera and is a born entertainer. The film where his locker is broken into in Vancouver, resulting in his losing all of his belongings, owes much to his contribution, but is also a beautifully made, exquisitely edited story, capturing the spirit of each moment of his trauma as he seeks to get a new passport.

Some of Bollywood&apos;s biggest names - virtually unknown in the west but huge stars across Asia - arrived in Bangkok last week to promote the industry, which has had a lean year thanks to the arrival of the country&apos;s wildly popular domestic cricket league, which has kept audiences out of cinemas for the past six weeks. Launched by the International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) eight years ago, the event has become a pit stop for global cinema buffs. The inaugural ceremony was held in London and in past years has been to Amsterdam, South Africa and, in recognition of the British diaspora&apos;s contribution, Yorkshire. Although Thailand has not traditionally provided big Bollywood audiences, police struggled to control the crowds who turned up to see the stars attend the Sarkar Raj preview on Friday. The dark political thriller, based on the real-life controversy around an Enron power plant built in India a decade ago, is the kind of new-wave cinema Bollywood wants to show the world - an Indian movie with an international feel that goes beyond the traditional song-and-dance format. The movie, which stars Indian megastar Amitabh Bachchan, is the follow-up to the 2005 film Sarkar, which borrows heavily from American classic The Godfather. Another mould-breaking movie is likely to be the slick sci-fi flick Love Story 2050 and the much-hyped thriller Mission Istanbul. The Indian film industry, which churns out hundreds of movies a year, has revenues of more than \u00a31bn, a fraction of what Hollywood earns. However, sales are growing. Bachchan told reporters that the unique culture of Bollywood has protected it from being subsumed by the Hollywood movie machine. &quot;The way Hollywood was able to destroy most of the other cinemas in the west - whether it was Italian, French or German, or British even - it will have a tougher time in India because there is a cultural difference.&quot; Keen to associate themselves with global causes, the big names of Bollywood, including Salman Khan, Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra, waltzed down a green carpet, instead of red, to spread awareness about global warming. On Friday, the head of the UN&apos;s Nobel-prizewinning climate panel took centre stage to call for greater efforts to stop climate change. Rajendra Pachauri accepted a special global leadership award and praised the event&apos;s host, Bachchan, for advocating action against climate change during the weekend gala. &quot;Change in the climate system of the world is unequivocal,&quot; he said after accepting the award. &quot;We rapidly have to bring about the stabilisation of Earth&apos;s climate.&quot; He also delivered a presentation highlighting the science behind his panel&apos;s forecast for the world.", "publicationDate": "2008-06-08T23:08:13Z", "tags": ["Film", "India", "World news", "Thailand", "Culture", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jun/09/news.india", "title": "Bollywood stars out in force for film industry awards in Bangkok", "sentences": ["Some of Bollywood&apos;s biggest names - virtually unknown in the west but huge stars across Asia - arrived in Bangkok last week to promote the industry, which has had a lean year thanks to the arrival of the country&apos;s wildly popular domestic cricket league, which has kept audiences out of cinemas for the past six weeks."]}, {"article": "Already 2008 has proved a tumultuous year in terms of global perceptions of China, and there are still 59 days to go until the Beijing Olympics. The tragedy of the Sichuan earthquake followed hard on the heels of the riots in Tibet and the demonstrations surrounding the Olympic torch relay. Sympathy and compassion, combined with admiration for the rescue efforts of the Chinese government, served to soften the harsh memory of the riots in Lhasa and the blue-tracksuited Chinese officials. The world is having a crash course on China. Inevitably, our view of these events is shaped by our western mindset. The problem is that as the global centre of gravity tilts away from the west, it is becoming increasingly important to look beyond our assumptions and gain a wider picture. We failed miserably in this respect on the Burma cyclone, behaving as if all that counted were western attitudes and aid, and only belatedly recognising that the key to unlocking the junta&apos;s resistance was the cooperation of its neighbours, together with the UN. In our indignation over Tibet we also largely failed to notice that in a large majority of cities the demonstrations in support of the Olympics were much bigger than those against. True, in London, Paris, Athens and San Francisco pro-Tibet demonstrators greatly outnumbered those expressing support for the games. In Canberra, however, 10,000 demonstrated in favour of the games, hugely outnumbering the protesters. In Seoul thousands turned out in support, as they did in Nagano in Japan, in both cases dwarfing the number of protesters; likewise in Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City and Hong Kong. Everywhere, those demonstrating support for the Beijing games were overwhelmingly comprised of Chinese - either students from the mainland or people from the local Chinese community.  The Chinese diaspora is long established in many countries, sometimes dating back to the 19th century, or much earlier in south-east Asia. It is often very diverse, combining several-generation settlers from Hong Kong and southern China with a large wave of new migrants, many poor and illegal; growing numbers of students; and those connected with China&apos;s burgeoning overseas economic interests, who are especially to be found in the countries around its borders. It is estimated that there are now at least half a million Chinese living in Africa, most of whom have arrived very recently. There are more than 7 million Chinese in each of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, more than 1 million each in Burma and Russia, 1.3 million in Peru, 3.3 million in the US, 700,000 in Australia and 400,000 in this country - about 40 million in all, which is almost certainly a considerable underestimate.  Notwithstanding the diversity of their communities - in terms of origin and length of stay - the overseas Chinese enjoy an extremely strong sense of shared identity as well as a powerful attachment to China, feelings that tend to override regional and political differences. This affinity finds expression in many ways. The overseas Chinese have played a crucial role in China&apos;s economic growth, providing the lion&apos;s share of inward investment since the late 1970s. According to the World Bank, in 2007 China received more remittances - nearly $26bn - than any other country except India.  In the case of many diasporas, those living overseas tend to enjoy greater prestige than those at home; the reverse is true of the Chinese. Status emanates from the Middle Kingdom, to the extent that more recent migrants tend to enjoy higher esteem than longer-established members of an overseas community. Until recently, indeed, China tended to look down upon those who had left its territory, but since the reform period began almost three decades ago the government has increasingly come to value Chinese overseas communities and sought to establish closer cultural and economic links with them. It is not difficult to imagine the pride that many overseas Chinese take in China&apos;s rise. After two centuries during which their homeland was synonymous with poverty and failure, it has risen to a position of great global prominence and allure in a remarkably short space of time. Television channels the world over are pouring out programmes about China, and in many countries people are signing up in large numbers to learn Mandarin. Not surprisingly, the gravitational pull exercised by China on its overseas communities has increased markedly as a result. My son&apos;s Sunday Mandarin school decided to cancel lessons for the day in order to proudly join the London festivities for the Olympic relay. For them China was coming home and being embraced by their adopted city. There was genuine delight in China&apos;s achievement and the global recognition that the Olympics signified. In taking to the streets in so many cities and in such large numbers in support of the Beijing Olympics, the overseas Chinese proved a powerful political force both in their adopted countries and for the Chinese government. This kind of phenomenon, of course, is neither new nor particularly Chinese: diasporas in many countries have long played a significant role in support of their homeland, the most striking recent example being that provided by the Jewish diaspora for Israel.  The Chinese diaspora, however, has three characteristics that together mark it out as distinct. First, it is numerically large and spread all around the globe, from Africa to Europe, east Asia to the Americas. Second, for historical and cultural reasons, it enjoys an unusually strong identification with the Middle Kingdom. Third, China is already a global power and destined to become perhaps the most powerful country in the world. And as its rise continues, as Chinese worldwide interests grow exponentially, the Chinese diaspora is likely to expand greatly; become increasingly prosperous, buoyed by China&apos;s own economic success; enjoy growing prestige as a result of China&apos;s rising status; and feel an even closer affinity with China.  Even then, however, to retain a sense of historical proportion, the Chinese diaspora will remain far less influential than the European diaspora. Such is the latter&apos;s ubiquity and longevity that we tend to take it for granted, often even failing to recognise its existence, let alone its huge influence and unique nature. Unlike the Chinese diaspora, whose growth hitherto has overwhelmingly been driven by China&apos;s poverty, the European diaspora was largely a function of Europe&apos;s colonial expansion. The European diaspora&apos;s most important monuments are those countries in which white settlers managed to establish themselves in the majority, once they had effectively eliminated the host population; namely the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  Today we habitually speak of the west and the western world, but these, in fact, are more or less synonymous with Europe and its diasporic lands, or what the economic historian Angus Maddison describes as &quot;western offshoots&quot;. That west, as we are aware, has dominated the world for the past 200 years. However powerful China might become, it seems inconceivable that its diaspora will ever exercise the kind of influence that Europe&apos;s has.  \u00b7 Martin Jacques is a visiting research fellow at the Asia Research Centre, London School of Economics  Martinjacques1@aol.com", "publicationDate": "2008-06-10T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/11/china.comment", "title": "As China's power grows, the diaspora starts to flex its worldwide muscle", "sentences": ["In Seoul thousands turned out in support, as they did in Nagano in Japan, in both cases dwarfing the number of protesters; likewise in Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City and Hong Kong."]}, {"article": "The Philippines became the latest country to be hit by protests over soaring fuel prices today when hundreds of lorries and mini-buses blocked roads leading to the presidential palace in Manila. Traffic was brought to a standstill around the Malacanang Palace as the demonstrators demanded a sales tax on fuel products be dropped to ease the burden of a 24% leap in pump prices this year. Riot police prevented a convoy of trucks and mini-buses reaching the palace, but the protesters carrying placards and streamers got their message on the country&apos;s independence day. Petrol prices in the Philippines are not subsidised and have risen 14 times in less than six months, fuelling the country&apos;s inflation and prompting President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to announce subsidies for the poor. Police in Malaysia have also tightened security in the capital ahead of a tomorrow&apos;s rally against a dramatic spike in fuel price. Protests over the 41% hike in petrol and 63% in diesel have been muted so far. But there is a deep well of anger that forced embattled prime minister Abdullah Badawi to promise no further fuel price rises this year. However, opposition politicians are hoping at least 20,000 demonstrators turn up after Friday prayers at a mosque in a poor Malay district of Kuala Lumpur. Up to 2,000 police have been drafted into the capital where roads may be shut to stop marchers reaching the Petronas Twin Towers in the city centre.

Motorists queued for petrol yesterday amid fears that the action by 650 drivers who deliver fuel to more than 900 Shell garages across the UK would lead to shortages and price rises. Many drivers yesterday ignored a &quot;don&apos;t panic&quot; plea from Downing Street as they topped up half-full tanks in preparation for a long weekend of industrial action.  Lines of cars stretched around filling stations in areas including Blackpool, Exeter, north Wales and Cambridgeshire, and the UK Petrol Industry Association reported a surge in sales. Filling stations in Liverpool and south Wales ran out of diesel after panic buying doubled the number of customers.  Last night the union Unite confirmed that talks with two haulage companies delivering to Shell garages had broken down after nine hours of negotiation yesterday. The pay row erupted over Unite&apos;s claims that tanker drivers are paid the same now as in 1992 - just under \u00a332,000 a year - despite working longer hours. But Shell claims average pay is more than \u00a336,000 and would have increased to around \u00a339,000 under an offer rejected by the union. A senior Unite official present at the negotiations said: &quot;We were prepared to go into negotiation and we made alternative proposals, and they hardly moved at all ... They offered us a 0.5% increase [on pay], which is not negotiating as we see it.&quot; He said the main reasons negotiations broke down was the failure of Shell to intervene. &quot;They make more than \u00a33bn profits and it would have cost them a tiny fraction of that to make the difference.&quot; Shell, which was not directly involved in the talks, said: &quot;It is regrettable that inevitably the action will have a significant impact on our petrol stations.  &quot;In the meantime we urge both parties to continue talking to find a resolution and will be working to ensure contingency plans are in place.&quot; The news prompted fears that non-Shell filling stations will be affected as employees refuse to cross picket lines. Shell runs one in 10 of about 9,500 filling stations across the UK, and the Petrol Retailers Association said a strike by 641 truck drivers would not affect supply if people buy according to &quot;normal requirements [because] there will be another nine out of 10 stations to choose from&quot;. But the assurances went unheeded by hundreds of motorists. Rural regions and places with a high concentration of Shell garages look likely to suffer the effects of any shortages. Acknowledging that Shell garages are mainly located in south-east England, the north-west, central Scotland and the Midlands, Unite said: &quot;Some areas are only supplied by Shell and they are the ones that will really be in trouble.&quot; Drivers in isolated rural areas take extra care not to let their tank run dry when there is any indication of impending shortages, according to consumer group PetrolPrices.com. A spokeswoman said: &quot;Motorists in some areas of the country where Shell stations are isolated may have no alternative filling stations.&quot; Filling stations could also take advantage in areas not directly affected by the strikes, she said. &quot;Even if there were one or two alternative stations in the area, motorists could still be hit by the strike if the other stations decide to put their prices up - drivers will have very little choice but to pay. Motorists need to stay vigilant to avoid being victims of profiteering.&quot; The breakdown of attempts to avert a walkout by employees of Hoyer UK and Suckling Transport means the strike will run from 6am today until 6am on Tuesday, despite Gordon Brown&apos;s claims that a deal was within reach. Painful memories of the panic buying and fuel rationing that followed blockades of oil distribution depots in 2000 may have fuelled fears over pumps running dry again. The government has drawn up contingency plans, allowing suppliers to share information about stocks without falling foul of competition laws. Fuel supplies to the emergency services would also be maintained. Protests over the price of fuel have spread across the world. Yesterday the Philippines became the latest country hit when hundreds of lorries and minibuses blocked roads leading to the presidential palace, in protest at 14 price rises in less than six months. Police in Malaysia tightened security in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, in advance of an opposition-inspired fuel price rally, while the Thai capital, Bangkok, is also bracing for action unless the government agrees to fuel subsidies.  Portuguese truckers yesterday agreed to end a three-day strike after the government offered a package of relief. But Spanish truckers were persisting with action that has generated shortages in petrol stations, food shops and markets. Panic stations Heath, Cardiff A Texaco station was one of several south Wales forecourts to run out of diesel yesterday. Newport, Shropshire A filling station manager described the level of anxiety yesterday as &quot;horrendous&quot; and warned of supplies running low.

In what they term their &quot;operation escargot&quot;, French truckers are urging motorists to join them at a snail&apos;s pace to paralyse traffic on ring roads and city centres. Hauliers want to force the government to lower fuel prices and tax, and harmonise the cost of diesel and petrol across Europe. This comes after a week of protests that have seen truckers paralyse Toulouse&apos;s ring road during rush hour, Bordeaux gridlocked by protesting hauliers, tractor protests in the north of France and the Spanish border route sealed. Angelique Chrisafis Barcelona Spain and Portugal are still reeling after lorry drivers&apos; strikes caused widespread disruption this week. Blockades across major routes in both countries cut food supplies and left shoppers facing empty supermarket shelves. Petrol stations ran dry as panic-buying spread, tourists faced delays as Lisbon airport ran out of fuel and car companies, Nissan, Seat, Ford and Citroen, closed due to lack of parts. Tonnes of fresh food were dumped while shoppers faced price rises. In Alicante fruit sellers said prices had gone up 50%. Two strikers were killed, near Granada and north of Lisbon, as they tried to stop vehicles passing picket lines. After thousands of police cleared blockades clashes with pickets led to 101 arrests and 605 fines for disorderly conduct. Lorry drivers protesting against rising fuel costs vowed to carry on their stoppage. Graham Keeley Caracas Sporadic protests over soaring fuel prices have paralysed motorways and cities across Latin America this month. A truckers&apos; strike in Chile shut main transport arteries, causing supermarkets to run out of meat, service stations to run out of petrol and a risk that hospitals could be left with no oxygen. The national confederation of truckers demanded that the government cut diesel taxes and road tolls to cushion a 50% rise in diesel prices. Goods piled up at ports and some bus companies cancelled services when an estimated 6,000 trucks camped on roads and motorways. The government offered a $1bn (\u00a3513m) fuel price stabilisation fund but truckers rejected that as too feeble. Transport workers in Nicaragua and Panama marched to demand government help to protect their livelihoods. Traffic jams snarled up Panama City, and in Managua the vehicles of strike-breaking taxi and truck drivers were stoned. In Venezeula bus drivers went on strike after the government ordered them to cut prices, a decision swiftly rescinded. Rory Carroll Asia Countries across south-east Asia are reeling from protests over fuel price rises after governments lifted subsidies that had cushioned the poorest consumers. Thailand is planning cash handouts for up to a year for food and fuel in an effort to mollify truckers threatening to bring Bangkok to a standstill on Tuesday. Indonesia, which had some of the lowest pump prices in Asia, raised prices by an average of 28.7% in May, sparking protests. Police in Malaysia braced for a mass opposition rally yesterday in Kuala Lumpur after petrol prices were raised by 41% and diesel by 63% last week when government subsidies were removed. In the Philippines, where pump prices have risen by 24% this year, demonstrators demanding that a sales tax on fuel be dropped brought traffic to a standstill around the presidential palace on Thursday. Ian MacKinnon Beijing China has put a six-month freeze on prices but state-run oil refineries and suppliers are complaining that they are making a loss, even with government subsidies and tax breaks to ease the pain. Many have slowed supplies, forcing petrol stations in some areas to close for long stretches of the day or to impose limits.

After weeks of trauma, they must now work out how they can repay the tens of thousands they borrowed to pay medical fees and expenses - because, despite being well travelled, they did not have insurance.  When Brenda&apos;s family rushed out to be with her, they found there was little support. &apos;We felt we were fumbling in the dark,&apos; says her sister, Christine O&apos;Connor, who lives in Langer, Nottingham. &apos;Initially nobody wanted to know because Brenda didn&apos;t have insurance. The hospital wouldn&apos;t treat her until they got paid.&apos;  For the family, that meant finding about \u00a33,000 a day for her care and some way to raise \u00a345,000 for an air ambulance to bring her back to the UK. They managed to scrape together the amount needed, but the morning she was due to fly, she died. There was still one final sting: because the flight had already left base, the family couldn&apos;t recover the fee, nor could they convince the ambulance to fly her body home.  &apos;They said Brenda&apos;s body was considered cargo and they couldn&apos;t carry her because they didn&apos;t have the licence to do so,&apos; says Christine. &apos;We had to find another \u00a36,000 to fly her home.&apos; Despite the efforts to raise money through events and an online appeal, they have been left with severe debts. Now struggling even to find the money for Brenda&apos;s funeral, they argue that travellers should be forced to prove they have insurance before they fly.  &apos;I don&apos;t want this to happen to another family,&apos; says Christine. &apos;It&apos;s just not fair on the people left behind.&apos; Brenda&apos;s case is rare, but not unique. In Lancashire, for instance, another family is currently facing bills of \u00a355,000 after 23-year-old Ryan Neale had a moped accident in Bangkok last month and was left in a coma. Although he is now back in the UK, his family still have no idea if he had insurance.  In the year to April, some 3,689 British nationals were hospitalised while overseas. Department of Health research suggests 2.4 million British people have needed medical assistance overseas and discovered that they did not have adequate cover.  While the majority of travellers take out cover of some form, according to the Association of British Insurers, the fear is that the number of those who don&apos;t bother may actually be growing. Foreign Office research published at the beginning of this year showed 28 per cent of people travelled uninsured, the highest level since it began tracking this five years ago. Younger travellers and those over 55 are particularly likely to risk travelling without cover. The problem, say insurers, is that often people don&apos;t appreciate the cost of medical treatment abroad. In some countries, particularly the US, it can easily run to seven figures.  &apos;We&apos;re a bit closeted in the UK because of the NHS,&apos; believes Nick Potter, general manager at Bupa Travel Services. &apos;We don&apos;t really understand the money involved.&apos; One Bupa policyholder is currently in an American intensive-care bed that costs $25,000 (\u00a312,700) a day. Flying them back to the UK will cost a further $100,000 - even an air ambulance from the Canary Islands back home would cost more than \u00a315,000. In Europe, of course, travellers are partly protected if they have a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), which replaced the E111 form. Indeed, even if you have travel insurance, your policy may require you to take one with you when you go abroad. However, the protection it provides is by no means comprehensive. For a start, it won&apos;t provide any cover unless it&apos;s valid, and the Department of Health recently found that half of travellers don&apos;t realise the cards have an expiry date. Even then, though, the card only entitles the holder to the free or subsidised emergency medical care they would get as a local.  As Brian Brown at financial services research company Defaqto points out, this means there&apos;s no cover for missed flights or to get you home afterwards. &apos;If you break your leg, then the EHIC will only guarantee you the minimum standard of medical care in that country,&apos; he says. &apos;Once they repair your leg and it gets a bit better the hospital staff will wheel you to the door and say goodbye.&apos; At the very least, you&apos;re probably looking at paying for two or three seats on a plane home so you can travel in plaster. If it&apos;s more serious, you could find yourself sitting in a hospital in southern Greece for three months. That&apos;s a significant price to pay for the sake of a premium that could be under \u00a310 and would ensure you were brought home for treatment.  Indeed, increased competition in recent years has seen the cost of travel insurance plummet. According to Defaqto&apos;s recent review of the market, prices are at their lowest level ever. Only annual cover for trips to the US has increased slightly, and even that is still below the price it was in 2003.  &apos;It&apos;s ridiculously cheap now,&apos; says Perry Wilson, managing director of Insure and Go, the largest travel insurer in the UK selling direct to the public. In 2000, when the company entered the market, the average price for a week&apos;s cover in Europe was \u00a347. Now his company offers the same cover for \u00a313.  Which? recommends, however, that travellers take out comprehensive, not just cheap, cover. It suggests buying a policy that has at least \u00a31m of medical cover in Europe and \u00a32m in the US, and a limit of at least \u00a31,500 for baggage and belongings, plus additional cover for money.  Even older travellers and those with pre-existing medical conditions, who have traditionally paid much higher premiums, have a much better chance of finding affordable insurance, although upper age limits vary between providers. Barclays has an upper limit of 69 on its annual and single travel insurance policies, Marks and Spencer has a limit of 70 on its annual policies. Bupa will not insure anyone over 79. NatWest, Saga, Intune, Age Concern and Co-operative Insurance, among others, have no upper age limits on their travel policies.  Insurance company Insure Pink has recently launched a policy for male cancer sufferers who may have been turned down for travel insurance or faced exorbitant premiums elsewhere. It is called Insure Blue, and is the &apos;male&apos; version of Insure Pink, which offers travel insurance to women who suffer from breast cancer or have a history of it. The male policy aims to offer affordable cover to men with testicular and prostate cancer. Of course, this competition isn&apos;t all good news: The big players argue that the range of cover offered by some of the cheapest policies isn&apos;t great, which can be a problem as many don&apos;t read the policy details. There is also some suspicion that the companies supplying the insurance are likely to take a much harder line on claims for some losses, such as those for luggage. Even a cheap policy, however, should cover medical expenses, and with prices as low as they are at the moment, there is little excuse for not taking one out - and every reason to do so. As Brenda&apos;s sister Christine puts it: &apos;Just don&apos;t take the risk, because you never know what could happen.&apos; Ticket to the best deal Shop around online There is more choice in the travel-insurance market than ever - good news for those paying over the odds buying policies from their travel agents, according to Peter Gerrard, head of insurance research at Moneysupermarket.com. &apos;In some cases you could actually end up paying the equivalent price of the holiday again just on the insurance through a travel agent,&apos; he claims. Think about multi-trip policies If you&apos;re going on two or more trips a year, it&apos;s worth considering annual cover, says Chris Price, head of travel at RBS Insurance. This will often be cheaper than two single-trip policies.  Don&apos;t just shop on price Policies vary wildly when it comes to cover for baggage, cancellations and delays, for example. Cheaper policies may severely limit cover in certain areas or impose a number of separate excesses for different sections of cover - for your passport, baggage and cash, for example. Some simply exclude cover in certain areas entirely. &apos;The policies aren&apos;t all the same,&apos; warns Chris Collings at Swinton Insurance. &apos;There are a lot of cheap policies out there, but ask yourself why they&apos;re so cheap.&apos;  Don&apos;t rely solely on the cover you get free with your card Brenda French&apos;s family say she usually took out travel insurance, but might have thought she was insured because she booked the trip on her credit card. In fact, this only covered her if the trip was cancelled. Read the policy At least read the sections that are most important to you. This won&apos;t just let you know whether you&apos;ve got the cover you expected; it will tell you what you need to do to make sure your claim is successful. You will, for instance, need to make a report to the police to claim for theft. &apos;It&apos;s in English; take the time to read it,&apos; advises Wilson at Insure and Go. &apos;It&apos;s better not to leave it until you actually come to make a claim and find you&apos;re not covered.&apos;", "publicationDate": "2008-06-14T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Travel insurance", "Insurance", "Money"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/jun/15/travelinsurance.insurance", "title": "How a \u00a310 policy could save a lot of heartache and thousands of pounds", "sentences": ["In Lancashire, for instance, another family is currently facing bills of \u00a355,000 after 23-year-old Ryan Neale had a moped accident in Bangkok last month and was left in a coma."]}, {"article": "Thaksin says stars foretell easing of protest turmoil The ousted Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a firm believer in astrology, said yesterday that the realignment of stars in early July will help defuse political tensions as anti-government protests in Thailand enter a fourth week.

In 2006 peaceful mass protests against prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, citing his abuse of power and rampant corruption, culminated in a military coup. Thaksin went into exile, and plotted his return to Bangkok via Maine Road and his takeover of Manchester City football club.  Now Thaksin has returned to Thailand and his cronies are back in government. After an interlude of a military-appointed ineffectual transitional government, which solved nothing beyond returning the country to democratic rule, we are back to where the protests started two years ago. Meanwhile the courts ruled that Thaksin, who had achieved unprecedented power during his five years in office, is barred from political activity for four years. Veteran rightist politician Samak Sundaravej, the new prime minister, is widely viewed as no more than a &quot;stand-in&quot; for the ambitious Thaksin waiting in the wings. Now the Samak government is under siege from both the anti-Thaksin movement and trade unions protesting over rising prices. Inside parliament the main opposition party the Democrat Party, has filed motions for a parliamentary debate and a vote of no confidence with the government, squirming to advoid any debates at all. Trade unions are also mobilising to support anti- government protests as rising food and fuel prices are beginning to further impoverish workers. The pressure is clearly building up from all directions against the unpopular leadership of prime minister Samak, still remembered by for his involvement in Thailand&apos;s most bloody coup in 1976 \u2013 the lynching of pro-democracy students and killing of farmers&apos; leaders.  The area around the prime minster&apos;s office has now been surrounded by demonstrators and all government meetings have been forced to move to other venues.  The threat of another military coup has receded, although in a country that has suffered 18 military coups and attempted coups since 1932, it can never be ruled out. The coup in 2006 failed to solve the bitter divisions between the rural people, especially in the north-east where there is overwhelming loyalty to Thaksin, and those in the urban areas who hate the man and his myriad business tentacles for using his premiership to consolidate his stranglehold on both political and financial power.  Thaksin is known as the Berlusconi of Asia \u2013 both of them billionaire tycoons with media interests that give them with a huge propaganda advantage over other parties. Such is the uncanny parallel in their careers \u2013 they both became prime minister in 2001 and both suffered defeat in 2006. In Thailand&apos;s political seesaw, the post-coup election in December 2007 also failed to bridge the gulf between urban and rural areas. The electorate returned Thaksin&apos;s men to run the country thanks to their popularity with the rural poor, guaranteeing the early resumption of hostilities between the pro- and anti-Thaksin camps.  The new Thaksinian government \u2013 with Thaksin lurking in the shadows \u2013 has lost little time in proposing amendments to the constitution that could help to get Thailand&apos;s billionaire tycoon off the hook in a string of corruption charges, with 16 cases currently pending before the courts.  These moves designed to rehabilitate Thaksin, inevitably incensed the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD) supporters to resume the battle for the nation&apos;s future in the streets of Bangkok. On May 20 the anti-Thaksin yellow brigades (yellow is associated with the royal family) attempted to lay siege to Government House as part of a final push to bring down the government. So we are back to square one.  Thaksin and the future of Thailand, just as in 2006, are the focal point of the daily protests. The sense of national crisis has resulted in a plunge of the Bangkok stockmarket, with investors getting the jitters over the political paralysis and chronic instability.  PAD demonstrators accuse Thaksin of wanting to destroy the country&apos;s revered monarchy, and the 2006 coup has been widely viewed as the culmination of a bitter division within Thailand&apos;s ruling class between the old establishment of traditional feudal rulers based around the monarchy, the bureaucracy and the military, and Thaksin&apos;s new modernising corporate elite \u2013 the nouveau riche plutocracy.  King Bhumiphol Adulyadej celebrated his 60th anniversary on the throne in 2006. He is revered by many Thai people, but any debate or criticism of the king is strictly forbidden. An interesting book on the Thai king called The King Never Smiles by Paul Handley is also banned. The coup-makers that ousted Thaksin from power claimed royal patronage and legitimacy. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a professor of political science at Chulalongkorn University commented: &quot;The role of the king was critical in this crisis, and is widely seen as having implicitly endorsed the coup&quot;.  The anti-Thaksin demonstrators always deck themselves in a profusion of yellow \u2013 yellow T-shirts, headbands and other dress \u2013 as a sign of monarchical fervour that characterises their anti-Thaksin protest. Increasingly rightwing in its ideological flavour, leaders call for oaths to taken to the trinity of nation, religion and king.  Seldom have Thai people been so fearful and nervous about the future. The only unifying figure in the whole country is King Bhumiphol, who has been on the throne for 62 years and is now in his 80th year and suffering several health problems. Between the two poles of the Thaksinites and the royalists, a group of Thai university academics have tried to chart a &quot;Third Path&quot; out of the deadlock. They have called on the government to stop meddling in the court cases pending against former prime minister, to stop tampering with the constitution and let the trial of Thaksin be solely determined by the judges. And they also called upon the other side \u2013 the anti-Thaksin yellow brigade to cool down and adhere to democratic path. If that advice were followed some semblance of peace and political consensus might return to Thailand and things might move forward. But with stubborn leaders on both sides, the battle of the old right versus the new rightists may continue for some time in the absence of any strong movement truly representing the interests of poor farmers, workers and the vast majority of Thai people.", "publicationDate": "2008-06-20T18:30:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/20/thailand", "title": "Tom Fawthrop: Thailand's own Berlusconi", "sentences": ["The spectacle of daily demonstrations in Bangkok once again demanding the removal of the elected prime minister makes it seem like 2006 all over again.", "Thaksin went into exile, and plotted his return to Bangkok via Maine Road and his takeover of Manchester City football club.", "These moves designed to rehabilitate Thaksin, inevitably incensed the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD) supporters to resume the battle for the nation&apos;s future in the streets of Bangkok.", "The sense of national crisis has resulted in a plunge of the Bangkok stockmarket, with investors getting the jitters over the political paralysis and chronic instability."]}, {"article": "Political tensions in Thailand grew yesterday when thousands of protesters, demanding that the five-month-old government quit, pushed through police lines to lay siege to Government House.

Humans are portrayed as irrational captives to their background and identity, unable to be objective. I do not share this view.Seven years ago, I founded Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia in which any reasonable person can join us in writing and editing entries on any encyclopedic topic. We are a charitable humanitarian effort to create and distribute a free high-quality encyclopedia to every single person on the planet. Already, we are the biggest, fastest-growing, and most popular general reference work in the world. Wikipedia attracts 683m visitors annually, with more than 10m articles in over 150 languages. Today, there are around one billion people online. In the next five to 10 years, the next billion people will be joining the great global conversation by coming online to participate in blogs, mailing lists and, of course, Wikipedia itself. If we look beyond the languages of Europe plus Chinese and Japanese, most Wikipedia projects are small but fast growing. Where the German Wikipedia is today, with more than a half million articles, the Hindi and Swahili editions of Wikipedia will be in just a few short years. If we were to take seriously the ideas of those who view all human activity through a lens of irrationalism and conflict, we would imagine that all of this would be impossible. But my experiences with Wikipedia have given me great optimism \u2013 optimism grounded in direct observation of the facts of reality \u2013 that the vast majority of people around the world are comfortable with the idea of working hard to present facts objectively. From Bangkok to Bogota, people can exchange ideas and share experiences. To the extent that we are thoughtful and reflective, we can learn from the best among us. To the extent that we are committed to reason and the non-initiation of force as fundamental organising principles for a free world, we can come together to create values that would be impossible for people dedicated to eternal class or ethnic conflict. Some are concerned about the erosion of local culture in the face of a world of hyper-connectivity. But the evidence so far suggests that people everywhere are rational enough for this to take place when it is a good thing, and to not take place when it is a bad thing. As people become more educated, more in tune with the idea that knowledge is a good thing, they tend to throw out the worst elements of their culture (such as rights violations and ignorant prejudice) and preserve that which has genuine value (such as science and art). I believe we are already beginning to see the fruits of this change worldwide. China has been widely, and properly, criticised for their extensive censorship of the internet, but it is not the criticism that is causing them to begin to dismantle that censorship. It is rather, I believe and hope, a growing understanding and appreciation for the power of a culture of communication both for prosperity, but also for the valid preservation of what is valuable in local culture. In an effort to begin to resolve the long-standing Tibetan problem, China has recently committed, in partnership with the Louise T Blouin Foundation, $70m to Tibetan cultural preservation. In my view, this reflects a preliminary but increasing understanding on the part of the Chinese leadership that free expression, particularly of the type fostered by projects such as Wikipedia with a kind focus on a loving effort to share knowledge, will lead to a stronger China. I hope that they will soon recognise the right of the Chinese-speaking people to assist in explaining China to the world by ending their ban on participation in Wikipedia. Wikipedia is booming in the languages of the developing world. People are writing in their own languages. This is the opposite of the monolithic culture which would have been the product of a top-down broadcast-oriented media. One important fact about participatory media is that people will participate in their own ways, expressing and preserving the best things that they care about. I advocate for the value of a universal encyclopedia which is accessible to everyone and which rationally puts forward the basic facts about various arguments and controversies in such a manner that newcomers to an issue can understand what the disagreement is about. Don&apos;t tell me what to think, don&apos;t feed me one side of the story; give me actual facts and I will think for myself to decide. And I respect you as a human being enough to return the favour. Wikipedia tends to be written by people who are significantly more educated than average, by people who are passionate about ideas, about getting it right. This is a good thing. Because thinking is not automatic, the avoidance of bias is not automatic. A ruthless precision in thinking is a great virtue in the project. And you have to bring that kind of precision because, unlike the comfortable writers of a classic top-down encyclopedia, you are likely to be contacted and challenged if you have made a flawed argument or based your conclusion on faulty premises. Such is the virtue of the marketplace of ideas. On any Wikipedia entry, if you wonder who wrote it and why, you can click on the history tab and see every change made to the article and who made that change. You can visit that person&apos;s user page and ask them a question. You can, for the first time, directly engage in the validation of the work before you. Or, just as we are normally too busy to attend jury trials, you can take comfort in the fact that there is a process, a system, a genuine social design behind the project which seeks to empower and preserve the possibility of improvement when there is an error. The overall lesson of Wikipedia is one of great humanitarian opportunity and hope. Tyrants and politicians have traditionally divided us and pushed us into war. People have been enslaved and abused in countless horrific ways. Ignorance and poverty, which go hand in hand with totalitarianism and control, continue to be widespread. And yet it turns out that as we have given a voice to millions of people with a mission to build &quot;the sum of all human knowledge&quot;, nearly all of them are able to do so with kindness, compassion, and thoughtfulness. Genuine collaboration is possible, and comes natural to us. Aristotle defined man as &quot;the rational animal&quot; and he was right. And when we set out in a spirit of genuine inquiry and respect for humanity, we can achieve great things. Each of us, coming to a project like Wikipedia for our own reasons, can help to build something that, I think, shows the promise of the future, our dreams of peace, to be within reach.

Samak Sundaravej, whose office remains under siege by tens of thousands of demonstrators who broke through police lines on Friday, is accused of being a proxy for Thaksin Shinawatra, the billionaire former prime minister ousted in a 2006 coup. Samak, defending his record before members of the senate, Thailand&apos;s upper house of parliament, was at pains to distance himself from Thaksin, the Manchester City football club owner who faces corruption charges at home. &quot;We are different,&quot; Samak was quoted as saying by AFP. &quot;The members of our political parties may come from the same groups but it&apos;s normal in Thai politics for people to change parties.&quot; Samak, a 73-year-old political veteran, took office after his People&apos;s Power party won the most seats in a December general election, the first since Thaksin was ousted by the military following large-scale protests against his rule. Critics accuse Samak of effectively governing on behalf of the ousted prime minister and obstructing investigations into Thaksin&apos;s alleged corruption, as well as more general incompetence and mismanagement, notably in economic matters. Four weeks of street protests calling for Samak&apos;s resignation culminated on Friday with activists breaking through police lines to blockade Government House, the seat of Thailand&apos;s government.  The demonstrations are headed by the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy, which spearheaded anti-Thaksin protests before the coup. The current political uncertainty, which has seen almost 13% knocked off the value of the Bangkok stock market in a month, has prompted concern that the military might take action again. The more immediate peril for Samak comes in parliament. After today&apos;s grilling in the senate, the more powerful lower house is due to take up the no-confidence motion tomorrow, with a vote expected on Thursday. In his weekly televised address to the nation yesterday, Samak said he would step down if the vote went against him, although this appears unlikely given that his six-party coalition holds around two-thirds of the seats in the lower house. He pledged to see out the protests and return to work at his besieged office, saying: &quot;I&apos;ll be patient for our country and will see who can be more tolerant.&quot; Samak said he would not send in either the police or the army to remove the protesters.", "publicationDate": "2008-06-23T09:59:59Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Politics", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/23/thailand", "title": "Besieged Thai PM defies critics over links to Thaksin", "sentences": ["The current political uncertainty, which has seen almost 13% knocked off the value of the Bangkok stock market in a month, has prompted concern that the military might take action again."]}, {"article": "The Glastonbury festival stomps defiantly into action this weekend, but the odd druid, &quot;chanting dome&quot; and James Blunt aside, you can rest assured that the truly weird festival action is happening elsewhere. 1 Boryeong Mud Festival, South Korea The rainy Glasto swamp has nothing on Boryeong city in the Chungcheong province, three hours from Seoul, which has 9.9million square metres of squidgy brown mineral-rich mud on nearby mud flats.

The latest manifestation of China&apos;s burgeoning gay scene is the emergence of gay tourism. In recent years, travel companies have begun offering tour packages to gay visitors to the Middle Kingdom, which is slowly - if awkwardly - coming to terms with homosexuality. In late 2005, Go Pink China (gopinkchina.com) became the first China-based travel company to offer gay-friendly tours. Accompanied by gay, English-speaking guides, Go Pink offers its primarily western clients city tours of Beijing, Shanghai and Xi&apos;an and custom adventure trips to the Silk Road, Yunnan, Sichuan and elsewhere. Sightseeing is enlivened with &quot;insider stories about gay empires, gay affairs in the Forbidden City and the gay history of China.&quot; Go Pink also introduces visitors to local nightlife, and fosters connections with the gay community. In Beijing, clients can network with Promen, and join volunteer programmes.  In 2006, Go Pink had 100 clients. Last year it had about 300. Purple Dragon (00662 238 3227, purpledrag.com), Asia&apos;s oldest and largest gay travel company, based in Bangkok, now sends some 600 clients a year to China, and Tongzhi Holidays (00852 29828281, tongzhiholidays.com) offers gay packages to Hong Kong and Macao.  Western travel companies also offer gay-friendly China packages. Man Trav (0845 0266 906, mantrav.co.uk) has three packages to China, including a 13-day Yangtze Passage cruise, \u20ac2,295 for two. Florida-based Hanns Ebensten Travel (001 866 294 8174 hetravel.com), the world&apos;s oldest gay travel company, has a 15-day, US$4,585 trip centred around a Yangtze River cruise. Last year, Wil Maxino, an economist who lives in London, took a one-week tour of Shanxi province in northeast China with Go Pink, visiting landmarks such as the Yungang grottoes, a Unesco world heritage site, and Pingyao, a picturesque town that was once the financial hub of the Qing dynasty.

You see, we had this lovely review in the Guardian ...&quot; Today&apos;s obscure little treasure is the Number One Cafe, named not after its self-evaluation, but its address in a road on the hoodie-infested outskirts of Notting Hill. Locally, it isn&apos;t obscure at all (Smythson babe Sam Cameron, no less, has been spotted eating there), yet it has never before been reviewed in a national newspaper. This suggests that so-called rivals lack my selfless commitment to providing a service, because Number One Cafe is in every regard a magnificent restaurant. Large portions of authentic, sensational and preposterously cheap Thai food with the odd Malay twist are charmingly served in a simple, airy room - paper flowers adorning doorways, open-plan kitchen, obligatory portrait of Thai king, big windows on to adjoining park. An eccentric policy of charging \u00a30.00 corkage for the booze you have to bring yourself - handily, there&apos;s an offie next door - is the final piece in a dazzling mosaic. When friends from the Porchester Spa Turkish baths in nearby Bayswater recommended the place to me, the detail that really sold me on it was this: the female half of the couple who opened it long ago, originally as a greasy spoon, has certain curry pastes sent to her weekly from Bangkok. Isn&apos;t that a glorious expression of perfectionism? She can&apos;t find the right herbs and spices in London, so she has her mother freeze-dry the mixtures and pop them in the post. The night four of us went, she was there in a corner, carving turnips into exquisitely elaborate roses (quite a Thai tradition; they&apos;d get a Michelin star for that alone if only they poncified the dishes and sextupled the prices), while her Malay husband ran the show. We ordered enough for six, and loved just about everything, not least for the vibrancy of the flavours. The one let-down was gang jerd, a clear soup with glass noodles, although its blandness came to seem a bonus given the extreme heat of zingingly fresh papaya salad with bird&apos;s eye chillies, peanuts and lemon juice. Chicken satay was tender and delicious, as was a dish of marinated sirloin strips in another opinionated chilli sauce (the cuisine here is predominantly from the north-east of Thailand, where they like things fiery), known for obvious reasons as Weeping Tiger. After that little lot, I was almost blubbing myself, what with the pores having already been opened by an afternoon in a broiling steam room, so the technically correct reply, when the jolly young waitress in a red ethnic blouse asked if we needed anything else, was, &quot;You&apos;re very kind. Just the water cannon, thank you.&quot; The main courses also tended towards the fiery, and of these the champion was gaeng penang, available, like many dishes, with several choices for the main ingredient. We opted for the prawn version, which came in a red curry paste sent over from Bangkok - a rich, sweet, garlicky, coconut-milky and generally fabulous sauce with a stunning depth of flavour. That underrated fish the pomfret came served whole and stir-fried with black fungus and ginger in a black bean sauce, and even if it was minutely overcooked, this proved another great dish. As were ped makarm, succulent slices of duck laced with tamarind (often cloying, but not here); gaeng pa, a herbal curry based in this case on luscious aubergine; and prig Thai sod, which turned out not to be Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson&apos;s nickname for Thaksin Shinawatra, but squid, mussels and prawns stir-fried in peppercorns, lime leaves, yet more chillies and &quot;holy basil&quot;. A vegetable side dish of water spinach and yellow beans was also a delight. What a sumptuous meal this was, what a restaurant this is - and what a man I am (though I say so myself, even though I know I shouldn&apos;t) for placing duty to you, the reader, high above personal gratification. Still, if anything could sustain me through the five years until a table is next available at Number One Cafe, it is the memory of that wondrous curry sauce airmailed by mother in old Siam.

Photograph: Russell Matcham Although it is heartening to see pictures from Katine of new school buildings being constructed as a result of the Amref&apos;s development project in northern Uganda, it is perhaps a pity that little thought has been given to how the bricks are made. These clay bricks, used in their hundreds of thousands in response to an urgent need for housing and schools, are devastating the Ugandan environment as they are fired in kilns requiring tonnes of firewood to fuel them. Recent research suggests that nearly 1kg of firewood is needed to make a single brick. So for the 10,000 bricks required for a small, two-roomed house, that&apos;s also nine tonnes of wood. Not only does this cause serious deforestation, but vast quantities of carbon dioxide (CO2) are emitted in the process. Using a calculation from carbon off-setters Climate Care, it is estimated that more than 14 tonnes of C02 is emitted in the firing of 10,000 bricks. That&apos;s the equivalent of a person taking six return flights to Bangkok. There is, however, a simple and sustainable alternative to this damaging use of clay bricks, in a country where the population is set to double in the next twenty years with its obvious need for homes and classrooms. Oblong blocks are made by compressing in a mould a moistened mixture of sub-soil (marram), and a little cement. These are then cured in the sun rather than fired. This technology has an additional interlocking feature, developed by Dr Moses Musaazi, an engineer at Makerere University in Kampala, which gives it both strength and simplicity of construction. Because the interlocking blocks are uniform in shape, unlike clay bricks which are often misshapen, they require much less mortar, reducing the cost still further. Not only that, the interlocking blocks are made on-site, whereas clay bricks are transported from their producers, pushing up transport costs with a significant number of bricks broken on the way. A second soil block press makes a curved block, which is used for constructing water storage tanks, with rainwater harvested from roofs providing an additional source of clean water for communities where a borehole or spring may be some distance away. Water tanks can range in capacity from 5,000 to 50,000 litres, for domestic or institutional use. This sustainable Interlocking Stabilised Soil Block (ISSB) technology has already been successfully adopted in parts of Uganda, with the additional benefit of school pupils earning a little cash by making blocks at the weekends, while learning of the need for sustainable development in the process. Because of its simplicity and the low costs involved, ISSB technology offers opportunities for community participation and income-generation. It is both appropriate and sustainable, responding to basic humanitarian needs in a country which has a beautiful but fragile biodiversity. The Haileybury Youth Trust is currently extending the buildings at a vocational college in Jinja, Uganda, using environmentally-friendly materials, while also training communities on the benefits of adopting sustainable technologies", "publicationDate": "2008-07-01T14:38:00Z", "tags": ["Society", "Katine"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/katineblog/2008/jul/01/whyamrefshouldbeusinggree", "title": "Amref should be using greener materials in Katine", "sentences": ["That&apos;s the equivalent of a person taking six return flights to Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Jamie Murray fell one match shy of defending the mixed doubles title he won 12 months ago with Jelena Jankovic when he and Liezel Huber were beaten 2-6, 7-6, 6-4 in last night&apos;s semi-finals by Bob Bryan and Samantha Stosur. After an assured first set Murray and Huber stood firm throughout the second when their opponents improved, only to allow the tie-break to slip away.

At four-all in the third Stosur and Bryan began to exert some pressure of their own with their returns and took their second break point when Murray double-faulted. Murray and Huber mustered two break-back points when Bryan served for the match in the next game to offer the Centre Court crowd hope but it was soon snuffed out by Bryan&apos;s powerful serve. &quot;It&apos;s been a good journey and I felt we played our best match of the tournament and were the better team but sadly we were not able to go through,&quot; said Murray. &quot;They played tough on the big points and ultimately we came up a little short.

There are pupils writhing on the floor in front of me, twisting their bodies into letter shapes to spell out countries&apos; names. This is a year seven drama lesson. The girls wriggle, their legs clad in the woolly white tights that the Daughters of Mary and Joseph - the order of nuns who founded this south London school in 1869 - decided would keep pupils safe on dark nights. You can see a Coloma girl&apos;s legs in a blackout. Suddenly, I remember a far-off drama lesson, more than 30 years ago, that saw me lying in a hall like this one, for a graveyard scene in Maurice Maeterlinck&apos;s The Blue Bird. Coloma is not my old school. I went to its smaller sister school, St Anne&apos;s College. In those days, they shared a &quot;drama and elocution&quot; teacher, the redoubtable Miss Cecily Skinner, who not only directed the school plays but also put us through drama festivals, not to mention London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art exams. &quot;Intercostal diaphragmatic breathing with abdominal control,&quot; was her war cry. The fact that I can still quote large chunks of poetry is entirely down to her. &quot;Shakespeare,&quot; insisted Miss Skinner, &quot;was for performing, not reading.&quot; I still think she was right. Soon after I left St Anne&apos;s, it amalgamated with Coloma, and the St Anne&apos;s site was sold off. The spot where I gave my Lady Macbeth is now a three-bedroom executive home. My old school&apos;s spirit lives on in Coloma, though. A voluntary aided comprehensive that sits high in the league tables and is hugely oversubscribed, Coloma also has specialist music-college status. More than half the 1,000 pupils are in one of the choirs, singing everything from Handel&apos;s Messiah to gospel. The headteacher, Maureen Martin, wants to introduce plain chant. There are two orchestras and several chamber orchestras. There are music studios and facilities for computerised composition. Last year, the girls took part in 48 concerts. The Addington hills are alive with the sound of music. So perhaps it&apos;s unsurprising that theatre is not as central as it was in my day. Mrs Martin says she would like more drama, but &quot;we don&apos;t have the time, the teachers or the space&quot;. Coloma tries, though. Dance is on the PE curriculum, but drama is tightly squeezed - even though the girls love it. The year sevens cite it as their favourite lesson. Clearly, lying on the floor pretending to be a letter beats algebra. It is only because of pupil pressure that, in future, drama will be available beyond year seven and before the start of GCSE drama and performing arts options. Coloma has a wide social mix, with many pupils coming from homes where theatre-going is part of family life, even if theatre is not on the doorstep as it was when I was a child. Back in the 1970s, Croydon&apos;s Ashcroft theatre had everything from Agatha Christie thrillers to Shakespeare and Chekhov. Now it&apos;s just Beauty and the Beast on Ice and The Lady Boys of Bangkok. Still, many of the year sevens have seen at least one big West End musical, and a high proportion perform out of school. Those studying GCSE drama and A-level theatre studies get a chance to attend a wide range of work, from the ubiquitous Woman in Black and Blood Brothers (shows entirely kept afloat by school parties) to more challenging fare, such as Brecht&apos;s The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui or Levi David Addai&apos;s play House of Agnes. Last year, head of drama Gill Tipper organised no fewer than 27 theatre trips. Shows are, however, vetted for suitability - which reminds me of the scandal I unleashed in the lower sixth when I staged Sylvia Plath&apos;s poem Three Women. Its allusions to abortion created uproar among the nuns. Late last year, I attended a research session for the McMaster report on excellence in the arts. Brian McMaster, a former director of the Edinburgh international festival, asked everyone there - all arts professionals - how they had become involved in the arts. In every case, the route was through participation, most often through school. In the past, artists and theatre-makers have been nurtured in schools. The difference between what happens today at Coloma and what happened when I was there is that drama and theatre have now been &quot;academicised&quot;: they exist only because you can take a GCSE or an A-level in them. In my day, it was just accepted that theatre was part of school life. Every summer term, each class would participate in the drama competition, putting on a play from scratch. By the time I&apos;d left St Anne&apos;s, I had been involved in devising, writing, directing, designing, acting in and stage-managing seven plays, with almost no adult input. I wouldn&apos;t be doing the job I do today without that experience. Mrs Martin says, sorrowfully, that today this would be impossible. &quot;There are too many exams, not just in the summer but throughout the year. There just wouldn&apos;t be the time.&quot; So the Coloma girls end up creating performance and theatre not for the sake of it, not because they really want to, but because it can be marked and graded, in what seems to be the GCSE equivalent of Pop Idol. As I take my leave, I can&apos;t help thinking the girls aren&apos;t as fortunate as I was - at school in a time before endless tests and league tables, when we could spend our days spouting poetry, putting on plays and seeing as much theatre as we could afford for the sheer pleasure of it. It was great fun. Little did I know how useful it would be.", "publicationDate": "2008-07-07T15:16:48Z", "tags": ["Art", "Schools", "Education", "UK news", "Culture", "Art and design"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/jul/07/art.schools", "title": "Lyn Gardner: What on earth would Miss Skinner think?", "sentences": ["Now it&apos;s just Beauty and the Beast on Ice and The Lady Boys of Bangkok."]}, {"article": "The former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra today went on trial in Bangkok&apos;s supreme court accused of corruption. The criminal trial is the first against Thaksin, the billionaire owner of Manchester City football club, since he was ousted from office in a pro-royalist military coup in 2006.The former prime minister is accused of having corruptly used his position to help his wife, Pojaman, to buy land. Prosecutors told the court the 772m baht (\u00a311.6m) she had paid the Financial Institutions Development Fund for 5.5 hectares (13.5 acres) of prime real estate in central Bangkok represented only a third of the land&apos;s true market value.The couple, who face up to 13 years in prison if found guilty, have denied any wrongdoing. They did not attend today&apos;s session, which heard contradictory evidence from two former prime ministers, Banharn Silapa-acha and Chuan Leekpai. Banharn, a political ally of Thaksin, told the court he could have had little influence on the process of buying land. However, Chuan, of the opposition Democrat party, said Thaksin had been able to influence the agency involved in the sale.  More than 40 witnesses are expected to testify during 13 days of scheduled hearings over the next two months. The case is one of many being brought against Thaksin and his allies, and threatens to bog down a new government, led by Thaksin loyalists, which is already facing mass street protests. When Thaksin was ousted, two years ago, royalist generals accused him of widespread corruption, undermining the nation&apos;s democracy and insulting the Thai king.There is no chance of an appeal if Thaksin and his wife are convicted, and they have already suffered several setbacks in the run-up to today&apos;s hearing. Three of Thaksin&apos;s lawyers were jailed last month amid claims they tried to bribe a judge.  More than $2bn of the former leader&apos;s assets have been frozen, and he and his wife have been barred from leaving the country. The corruption hearing started on the day two other cases involving Thaksin allies closed with findings against the defendants, among whom was the current prime minister, Samak Sundaravej. The verdicts could bring down the coalition government. The constitutional court today opened the door to impeachment proceedings against the entire Thai cabinet. The move came after judges ruled that Samak&apos;s government had wrongly signed an agreement to back efforts by neighbouring Cambodia to win UN recognition for a 900-year-old temple on the border without first getting parliamentary approval.The supreme court also delivered a guilty verdict on electoral fraud charges against the former parliamentary speaker today.  Convicted of buying votes, the deputy leader of Thailand&apos;s People Power party (PPP), Yongyut Tiyapairat, was banned from politics for five years.  The ruling could force the dissolution of the main party in the coalition government, forcing new elections.", "publicationDate": "2008-07-08T11:25:58Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/08/thailand", "title": "Thaksin Shinawatra: corruption case against former Thai PM begins", "sentences": ["The former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra today went on trial in Bangkok&apos;s supreme court accused of corruption.", "Prosecutors told the court the 772m baht (\u00a311.6m) she had paid the Financial Institutions Development Fund for 5.5 hectares (13.5 acres) of prime real estate in central Bangkok represented only a third of the land&apos;s true market value.The couple, who face up to 13 years in prison if found guilty, have denied any wrongdoing."]}, {"article": "During Tyrone Edgar&apos;s rise to the top of the British sprint scene he took extra motivation from the exploits and glory of Tim Montgomery and Marion Jones. &quot;You watch them and you say &apos;I want to be there one day, I want to do that one day.&apos; I still would have been where I am, but they kind of forced the situation,&quot; he said. Although Montgomery and Jones, the two best sprinters in the world in their time, are now behind bars with their careers disgraced by drugs, they remain a driving force for Edgar, who is determined he can make an impression at the Olympic Games in Beijing next month. &quot;It just urges me on to know that if they had to do whatever they did or whatever they were taking, and you do it clean, you give yourself a pat on the back because you are the better athlete,&quot; he said.  &quot;I admired [Montgomery] running 9.7sec and Marion winning five medals [at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney]. That stuff really inspired me. When the truth came out, you get upset. I am self-minded. I am a focused athlete and I try not to let any of it get to me. The quicker it goes out of my mind, the better.&quot; Just days before the biggest race weekend of his career, Edgar uses the word &quot;cool&quot; umpteen times. His concentration is geared on one outcome in the 100m at the Aviva Olympic trials in Birmingham which start on Friday night. &quot;I am not going there to lose,&quot; he said. Edgar, 26, set the standard which Dwain Chambers has had to follow in Britain this summer, clocking 10.06sec to top the rankings until his fellow Londoner ran 0.01sec quicker to overtake him. &quot;Times do not mean anything at the weekend,&quot; said Edgar. &quot;It is all about placing. It will be a big occasion for me because I am top-three in the country and I want to stay there.&quot; Self-belief is his watchword. When he was 20, he decided that he would be better off training in America and, after packing up his job in a sports centre, he flew to Kansas where he began a university course in agricultural development. He is now based as a full-time athlete in Los Angeles where he is coached by Darrell Smith, nephew of the American athletics guru John Smith and husband of Tasha Danvers-Smith, Britain&apos;s top woman 400m hurdler. &quot;I see myself as British,&quot; he says. &quot;It is where I am from. I just went out to America for business. I felt it was a better place for me to be so I can run faster. I needed at the time to run against people who are 10.1 or 10.0. I wanted to be able to train in one facility instead of going from north to south to east to west, which I was doing when I was here. That was when I went to Kansas. &quot;I have never looked back. I knew it was going to be a struggle for the first couple of years but I have matured more. Being able to live by myself and do stuff for myself gave me an opportunity to go from a boy to a man.&quot; Edgar is not new to the international scene. He ran his personal best of 10.04 in 2003 and reached the quarter-finals of the European Championships two years later. But for eye-catching performances, this season has been his best. At the end of last month he won the 100m at the European Cup in Annecy on an afternoon when he produced a stunning second-leg run in the 4x100m relay, a performance which alone should book him his spot for Beijing. He could not plan for what would happen next, though. At the grand prix meeting in Lille, he injured his back by running into a shot-putter during his warm-up. &quot;I kind of bumped into him but got out of the way at the same time and jerked my back a little bit,&quot; he says. He is back in training, though, and nothing will break his concentration if he lines up alongside Chambers for the 100m final on Saturday. That is the way it will probably be but whatever the hype or tension on what will be some occasion, he will block it out. &quot;I am not thinking about that,&quot; he says. &quot;He [Chambers] has done his time and now he is back. If he had not done his time, it would be a different a story. I have confidence in my talent.

We were going to come up with a complicated Uefa coefficient-style scoring system based on the goals per game average, length of the streak, the level of opposition and so on and so forth, but in the end (well, after five minutes of trying) we decided simply to present our favourite 10. 1) Masashi Nakayama (Jubilo Iwata, Apr 15-Apr 29 1998, 16 goals in four games) Owen Goodyear and Stephen Whitehurst write in to offer Japanese poacher Nakayama&apos;s short and sweet streak back in 1998. &quot;As my Japanese ex-girlfriend reminded me on an almost hourly basis, he scored hat-tricks in four consecutive J-League games - 16 goals in all,&quot; writes Owen. &quot;Oh, and he has the fastest ever international hat-trick for good measure, three minutes and three seconds against Brunei in 2000.&quot; His streak: 5, 4, 4, 3. 2) Coen Dillen (PSV Eindhoven, Jan 27-Mar 31 1957, 20 goals in nine games) &quot;He doesn&apos;t beat George Camsell, but Coen Dillen deserves a mention,&quot; writes Martijn ter Haar. Dillen, nicknamed &quot;Her Kanon&quot;, banged in 43 goals in the 1956-57 season, an Eredivisie record. His streak: 3, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3. 3) Gerd M\u00fcller (Bayern Munich, Sep 27 1969-Mar 3 1970, 23 goals in 16 games) Der Bomber&apos;s stunning scoring streak certainly beats Camsell for longevity. Oliver Alexander wrote in to suggest this six-month spell as the swinging 60s gave way to the savage 70s. &quot;Note that the actual sequence of matchdays was quite a bit shuffled due to inclement wintery conditions,&quot; writes Oliver. &quot;Also, M\u00fcller missed one match due to injury.&quot; The story of that season, with Bayern missing out to a Berti Vogts-inspired Borussia Monchengladbach, is here. His streak: 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1 4) Owen Coyle (Airdrie, Sept 15-Sept29 1990, 12 goals in four games) Not a name you&apos;d expect to see on this list, it&apos;s fair to say, but Coyle had a remarkable fortnight early in the 1990-91 season. &quot;He went supernova scoring 17 goals in Airdieonians&apos; first seven games,&quot; writes Steve Guy, &quot;and only scored three more in the league for the rest of the season.&quot; His best uninterrupted run came after a hat-trick against Forfar. His streak: 3, 2, 3, 4 5) Steve Bloomer (England, Mar 9 1895-Mar 20 1899, 19 goals in 10 games) &quot;As a Derby County fan it&apos;s always useful to look up Steve Bloomer&apos;s record in these cases,&quot; writes David Hopkins. &quot;Bloomer scored in each of his first 10 England games - 19 goals in total.&quot; And that&apos;s as good an international spell as we can find. His streak: 2, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2 6) Refik Resmja (Partizan Tirana, Feb 18-Mar 4 1951, 24 goals in four games and May 5-Jun 10 1951, 18 goals in six games) Probably our favourite name on this list, if only because of the improbable 14-year-old-playing-in-the-Under-9s scoring figures. The opponents weren&apos;t of a particularly high standard (Puna Gjirokaster, Spartaku Qyteti Stalin and so forth), but his flurry of goals has no equal in top-flight world football. Even then, his tally of 59 goals in 23 games in a team total of 136 in 26, weren&apos;t enough to bring Partizan the title. They finished two points behind city rivals Dinamo. His streaks: 6, 7, 7, 4 and 3, 4, 1, 4, 5, 1. 7) Jos\u00e9 Saturnino Cardozo (CD Toluca (Mex) Sep 21-Nov 24 2002, 19 goals in 11 games) Cardozo began his streak on September 21 with a solitary goal against Queretaro and ended it on November 24 with a goal against Santos in the final game of the regular season. In between, the Paraguayan banged in 17 goals in nine games. He also scored six goals in five post-season games to help his side to the title. His streak: 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1 8) Dave Mooney (Cork City, Jun 1-present, 11 goals in six games) Mooney makes this list by virtue of potential. The Cork City striker, writes Lorcan Connolly, has scored five braces in his last six games and once in the other. &quot;With City&apos;s next two games being against whipping boys Cobh and Finn Harps, there&apos;s every reason to believe his remarkable run will continue,&quot; writes Lorcan. Mooney didn&apos;t play in Monday&apos;s 1-0 win over Cobh, so his run his still alive. His streak: 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2 ... 9) Rodion Camataru (Dinamo Bucharest, May 17-Jun 25 1987, 21 goals in seven games) One of the greatest Romanian forwards of all time, Camataru hit a purple patch in a prolific season at the end of 1986-87. The striker scored a remarkable 21 goals in the final seven games of the season, finishing the campaign with 44, exactly double the number of his nearest rival, the current Romania manager and then Steaua Bucharest forward Victor Piturca. His streak: 1, 3, 3, 2, 4, 5, 3 10) Mario Jardel (FC Porto, Oct 29 1999-Jan 15 2000, 18 goals in nine games) It&apos;s sometimes easy to forget that the portly figure who warmed the Bolton Wanderers bench in 2003 and 2004 was once the most lethal striker on the planet. At the beginning of the new millennium, the Brazillian was in the middle of a nine-game scoring spree that included three hat-tricks in four games leading up to Christmas. His streak: 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2 AT LAST - FOOTBALL ALL YEAR ROUND &quot;The Uruguayan championship 2007-08 started on August 18 2007,&quot; Pablo Miguez wrote last week, &quot;and finished last Wednesday with Defensor Sporting crowned champions. Now, a mini-league with the top six teams will be played to see which teams will play the international competitions. It will end on July 20. That means the season will be 11 months and two days long. Which makes me wonder, has there ever been a longer season?&quot; Well, Pablo, two readers have pointed us toward seasons that can out-last the Uruguayan marathon. Firstly, Ian Williams writes to explain the remarkable 1997-98 season in South Africa. &quot;Back in 1997-98, the South African League season kicked off on August 1, running through until May, with the cup final taking place on May 17. Unfortunately, the rules were such that, when the final finished in a draw, even after extra-time, a replay was the only way by which the contest could be resolved. However, due to preparations for the 1998 World Cup, a national training camp was scheduled for May 19. As the two finalists, Sundowns and Orlando Pirates, had players with the national team, the replay could only take place on July 26.&quot; But, Jostein Nygard can beat that. The Norwegian FA found itself in a mess when it tried to bring in a revised league system. &quot;Before the Norwegian FA introduced a nationwide first division playing from spring to autumn in 1963, they had to finish off the old two-group &apos;Main League&apos; which ran from summer to summer,&quot; says Jostein. &quot;What they did in the last season of the &apos;Main League&apos; was to combine the two eight team groups into one 16 team league, starting on July 30 1961, and ending on 21 October 1962. This works out at 14 months, 21 days.&quot; KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;Is Verein f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach the longest team name in football?&quot; asked Robert Bashford and Justin Walker, back in 2005. Far from it chaps. &quot;I&apos;d like to nominate my team, UCD, in the League of Ireland Premier Division,&quot; said Kevin Burke. &quot;Under some universities act a few years ago, we officially became University College Dublin, National University of Ireland Dublin, Association Football Club (81 letters). There are some who&apos;ll suggest that, with that hideous new crest, it should now (unofficially) be University College Dublin Dublin, National University of Ireland Dublin, Association Football Club (87 letters). This would translate into Irish as Cumann Sacair Ollscoil na h\u00c9ireann Baile \u00c1tha Cliath Baile \u00c1tha Cliath, Ollscoil N\u00e1isi\u00fanta na h\u00c9ireann Baile \u00c1tha Cliath, which is 102 letters and a comma.&quot; Not bad, Kevin, but a rival school of learning trumps it. &quot;I think you&apos;d have to go some to beat the full name in Thai of Bangkok University FC,&quot; claimed Liam O&apos;Brien. &quot;This would include the longest place name in the world, using the official Thai name for Bangkok.

The atmosphere on the Kippax was spicily hot as the tepid hosts, with one point from the opening three games of the season, were outclassed by Blackburn Rovers. At half-time, as Reid was exhorting more effort from his players, chairman Peter Swales&apos; recently-appointed general manager and hatchet man John Maddock was walking around the pitch, getting a taste of the sentiments on the terraces. Reid was fired the next day. The ex-Everton and England midfielder may smile at the thought that if, as expected, he takes the Thailand national team job next month, his new salary could be bankrolled in part by City owner Thaksin Shinawatra. Football Association of Thailand (FAT) president Worawi Makudi hinted as much earlier this week, saying: &quot;Thaksin loves football, he loves his country and he has offered to help us, with anything.&quot; Reid, however, may have to build a few bridges after indulging in a spot of the Noel Gallaghers when protesting the exit of Sven-Goran Eriksson in May. &quot;[Thaksin] has got to get a life. [He&apos;s] got to get a grip. It&apos;s alright running a country, sometimes it&apos;s harder to run a football club,&quot; Reid raged. He may also need to brush up on some homework because, though he has been appearing as an English Premier League analyst in Singapore, that is about as far as his Asian football experience goes - although he did turn down the Iran job earlier this year. But Reid should be warned that, while expectations aren&apos;t as high in Bangkok as in Tehran, they aren&apos;t low either. &quot;We expect to qualify for the 2014 World Cup with Peter Reid. The whole nation will be behind him,&quot; Ongart Kosinkha, FAT general-secretary, told me. Though talk of the 2014 World Cup may seem premature, it&apos;s now Thailand&apos;s focus after 2010 slipped from the agenda after five defeats in six third-round qualification matches prompted former manager Chanvit Phalajivin&apos;s resignation in June. It means that Reid&apos;s long-term task will be to edge the Thais nearer to the global stage - if, of course, he can first manage to inspire them to break out of south-east Asia and on to the continental scene. In the short-term, Reid&apos;s mission is to reassert Thailand&apos;s regional dominance at December&apos;s ASEAN Championships, a tournament they have won three times from 1996 to 2002 before Singapore claimed the last two. Perhaps part of the problem lies at the Thais&apos; failure to travel well. Certainly in England few have settled. Kiatisuk &quot;Zico&quot; Senamuang had a very short spell with Huddersfield in 1999 but didn&apos;t fare well. &quot;I wasn&apos;t happy, I wasn&apos;t good enough, it was too cold and I was homesick. I learned how tough English football is,&quot; he admitted. Three Thai internationals - Suree Sukha, Kiatprawut Saiwaeo and Teerasil Dangda - signed for City earlier this year but, no sooner had they set foot in England than they were sent on loan to the continent. But though Thais may not have found much success in England, Thailand has seen great success with an Englishman. Perhaps Reid could turn to fellow Scouser Peter Withe, Thailand&apos;s most successful manager after delivering two regional titles in 2000 and 2002. &quot;The game in Thailand was in a mess when I took over,&quot; Withe said in 2005. &quot;They had been suspended by Fifa, along with Indonesia, over a 1998 Tiger (ASEAN) Cup match which neither side wanted to win. Victory would have meant going to play Vietnam in Hanoi.&quot; It was a fate both teams were keen to avoid as, with qualification already assured, neither wanted to face the stronger Vietnam when the weaker Singapore offered greater chance for progression. Playing Vietnam would also have meant moving their training base from Ho Chi Minh City. The result was one of the most notorious games in Asian football history. Thailand won 3-2 thanks to a deliberate own goal scored, despite the Thais best efforts, by Indonesia&apos;s Mursyid Effendi. Withe&apos;s relationship with the FAT was sometimes as stormy as the furore which followed that game. He was once given a touchline ban by the FAT for wearing shorts rather than a suit. &quot;It was never about the shorts,&quot; says Withe, though FAT comments about his dress style had been circulating in the Thai-language press for some time. &quot;It was because we&apos;d lost to the United Arab Emirates and failed to qualify for the Olympics&quot;. Perhaps he has a point as it was after that 4-1 first-leg loss against the UAE in September 2003 that FAT president Vijitr Getkaew (who forced Withe to take a 25% pay cut when renewing his contract in 2002) complained: &quot;Peter should have reported to me after the first match about everything that happened but he did not come ... This means that he was not interested in the result. Prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra wants to see the Thai team go to the World Cup finals so we must try our best to reach this target.&quot; Getkaew wanted a style more suited to the physique of Thai players than Withe&apos;s English way. It led to, in early 2003, the appointment of Brazilian Carlos Roberto Carvalho on the coaching staff and, soon after, reports of meddling in team selections surfaced. There was even talk of giving Carvalho responsibility for the Olympic team before the UAE match. According to cynics, though, as defeat was expected, it would have robbed the FAT of its reason to end its relationship with Withe, who was eventually suspended for the last two months of his contract, while Carvalho was given the job. It would perhaps serve Reid well to heed such cautionary tales. With FAT boss Worawi also not slow to voice an opinion - and with his job supposedly not as secure as it once was - the pressure will be on the new Thailand manager to hit the ground running. He will at least inherit a team that have displayed talent, as the 2007 Asian Cup, co-hosted in Bangkok, proved. A draw against eventual champions Iraq was followed by victory over Oman. And though the 4-0 defeat handed out by Australia in the final group match may have seemed emphatic, in reality it was a game in which Thailand more than matched the Socceroos for 80 minutes. Thai club teams have demonstrated that they can compete in the Asian Champions League - up to a point. Thai title-holders Chonburi FC this year drew with Japan&apos;s Gamba Osaka and Korea&apos;s Chunnam Dragons before defeating Melbourne Victory. The flipside is that Krung Thai Bank FC conceded 17 goals in their two games against Japanese champs Kashima Antlers. Then, despite Chonburi&apos;s exploits, Thailand&apos;s league wasn&apos;t deemed strong enough to warrant an automatic place in the revamped 2009 version, after being ranked 13th in Asia by the Asian Football Confederation behind Singapore and Indonesia. A lack of good facilities, professional coaches and a structured youth system is holding the nation back. Skill, though, is not a problem. Players like Suree and young striker Teerathep Winothai, who spent time with Everton and Crystal Palace&apos;s youth teams, are as technical as any on the continent. Strength is an issue, however, as the team can be out-muscled by both east and west Asian opponents. And discipline can be a problem. In the first leg of the 2007 ASEAN final, the Thai players left the pitch for 15 minutes in protest at a penalty awarded to Singapore. Reid&apos;s no-nonsense approach appeals to the FAT, which may or may not have seen his colourful half-time team talks at Sunderland in the Premier Passions documentary, but he has to prove that he is, as Ongart Kosinkha believes, &quot;the right man for the job, an ex-footballer with lots of coaching experience&quot;. The Thai media, too, are uncertain. The Nation called Reid&apos;s potential appointment a &quot;coup for Thai football&quot;, saying he is &quot;the first foreigner with a proven managerial record to take over as coach of the team&quot;. However, The Bangkok Post wanted the other candidate Holger Osieck. The German, who dropped out of the running late on, took Japan&apos;s Urawa Reds to the 2007 Asian title and, though the newspaper conceded that Reid was the bigger name in Thailand, it said: &quot;Whether Reid is a good coach is highly debatable. He has coached Manchester City, Sunderland, Leeds and Coventry as well as England&apos;s Under-21 side - with little success. Osieck was probably a better choice. Osieck has a much better CV than Reid.&quot; This was countered by Worawi, who said Reid&apos;s record had the usual &quot;ups and downs&quot;. The only certainty? That it will be fascinating to see which way Thailand go under old Monkey Heed.", "publicationDate": "2008-07-11T13:41:18Z", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jul/11/3", "title": "Football: John Duerden on how Peter Reid would fare as manager of Thailand", "sentences": ["But Reid should be warned that, while expectations aren&apos;t as high in Bangkok as in Tehran, they aren&apos;t low either.", "He will at least inherit a team that have displayed talent, as the 2007 Asian Cup, co-hosted in Bangkok, proved.", "However, The Bangkok Post wanted the other candidate Holger Osieck."]}, {"article": "Only for the most unambitious student deadbeat is the summer vacation a time for relaxing. Instead, it is a chance to work harder than ever on collecting CV-boosting experiences - the kind that can fill a job interview with memorable anecdotes illustrating leadership skills in the face of a raging polar bear or dysentery. There is only one exception to this rule, which applies to students whose close friends happen to spend every summer at a family home in the Maldives. Those students can holiday with little more to worry about than their suncream factor, and still put on their CV &quot;networking skills&quot;. They also win out because the other point of having a holiday as a student is to spend as little money as possible. Many students find that what they remember most about a mind-expanding round-the-world trip is the really cheap pizza they found near Venice&apos;s St Mark&apos;s Square, or the free accommodation at a brothel in Bangkok. After a few weeks of penny pinching, you will find yourself arguing that it is clearly more sensible to choose the \u00a32 rather than \u00a310 hotel room, even if it means you miss out on seeing the Taj Mahal and will be staying in a war zone. For this reason, it is important not to get so obsessed with saving money that you fail to take out insurance. You must also make sure that this covers not only all the countries you plan to visit, but all the activities in which you plan to take part. Scan your insurance details along with those of your passport, travellers&apos; cheques and travel itinerary, and email them to yourself, leaving a hard copy at home. You can also store the scanned documents in myonlinesafe.co.uk run by STA Travel. Appealing as it is to be spontaneous, it is wise to pre-book your first night or two of accommodation and get hold of some local currency before you leave. It is also sensible to arm yourself with several different sources of money - cash, travellers&apos; cheques and a credit card - so that it won&apos;t be too much of a disaster if you lose one, and look into any discount cards it might be useful to carry, such as the International Student Identity Card or YHA card giving access to international youth hostels. Also consider getting an STA Travel cashcard, which allows you to hold up to \u00a35,000 in a secure online &quot;e-ccount&quot; and move the money on to your card by text, telephone or via the internet. Meanwhile, make sure family and friends know where you are and what you are up. Telephone them regularly or set up a blog. Or even better, take some of your friends with you.

A Thai army chief immediately denied any incursion but said its soldiers had taken up positions near the 11th-century Hindu temple on Thailand&apos;s soil to protect its territory. The Preah Vihear complex - long a source of bitter wrangling between the neighbours - was awarded world heritage site status by the UN&apos;s cultural organisation last week. A Cambodian official claimed the troops entered the temple complex following the arrest of three Thai protesters who managed to sneak across the border. Hang Soth, director general of the Cambodian authority responsible for the Preah Vihear complex, said the Thai troops had crossed the border near the temple site. &quot;Confrontation is occurring between Thai troops and our Cambodian troops,&quot; he said. &quot;Our troops have been ordered to be on alert but not to shoot first.&quot; He added that Cambodian guards had stopped the protesters - a Buddhist monk, another man and a woman - and were willing to hand them back immediately. Cambodia closed the temple to visitors from Thailand late last month. The festering row over the site was reignited after the then Thai foreign minister Noppodol Pattama backed the Cambodian application for world heritage listing. He was forced to step down after a Thai constitutional court ruled he had overstepped his authority by offering the government&apos;s backing without consulting parliament. Anti-government protesters, who have been staging demonstrations in Bangkok for weeks, seized upon the dispute as yet another means to attack the ruling People Power party coalition. The protesters claimed the prime minister Samak Sundarvej&apos;s government had lent support to Phnom Penh&apos;s listing application in return for business concessions in Cambodia for the ousted premier Thaksin Shinawatra. The dispute between Thailand and Cambodia centres on land around the temple complex, which is situated on a cliff-top. Because of the difficult terrain, access for visitors is vastly easier from the Thai side. Thai troops occupied the temple complex in 1954 after the withdrawal of French troops from Cambodia. Phnom Penh protested to the international court of justice in The Hague in 1959, prompting a severing of diplomatic relations and threats of force by both sides. But in 1962 the international court ruled that the temple, whose Hindu roots echo the more famous Angkor complex, lay on Cambodian soil, to the anger of many Thais.

Photo: Tang Chhin Sothy/AFP/Getty Images     Preah Vihear, a stunning temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, is perched on a Cambodian cliff-top straddling the Thai border. It was finally awarded World Heritage status this month, despite fierce protests from ardent Thai nationalists and the parliamentary opposition in Bangkok. Now, according to a Cambodian official, 40 Thai troops have crossed the border and entered the temple complex. The temple&apos;s ornate structures date back to the eleventh century, but the site was occupied two hundred years earlier. Preah Vihear has become an explosive issue in domestic Thai politics. It has also exposed how narrow-minded nationalism can obstruct efforts at world conservation. Indeed, according to the Thai opposition leader Abhisit Vejjajiva, the dispute over the temple&apos;s ownership is the &quot;knockout punch&quot; that could bring down the Thai government. Unesco&apos;s World Heritage Committee should be congratulated for their refusal to bow down to frenzied claims that Thai sovereignty is being compromised. Much of the furore has focused on the 4.6 kms of disputed land surrounding the temple, which is claimed by Thailand. But the UN committee judged the Cambodian claim \u2013 pending since 2001 and repeatedly delayed by Thai objections - on its merits, and refused to cave in to the barrage of Thai petitions and political pressure. The foreign minister was forced to resign over his inept handling of the issue. Cambodia and Thailand share much in common - culture, Buddhism and many traditions - but rivalry has led to centuries of distrust and simmering border disputes. Cambodians remember with pride that the temples of Angkor were the foundations of southeast Asia&apos;s greatest empire, the Khmer, which took in parts of what are today Laos, Thailand and Vietnam and Burma. Preah Vihear is now added to the legendary Angkor Wat at the heart of this Khmer civilisation. The death blow to 400 years of Khmer rule was dealt by an invasion from Siam in 1431. Since the decline and fall of the great empire of Angkor during the 14th and 15th centuries, Cambodia has suffered a series of invasions and loss of temples and territory. The only victory achieved by the Khmer people during this long period of humiliation and retreat was won not on the battlefield but in the courts. In 1962, the International Court of Justice in The Hague made a landmark ruling that Preah Vihear \u2013 then under Thai military occupation - was a Khmer temple and part of Cambodia&apos;s heritage. The Thai dictatorship reluctantly complied with the judgment, removing Thai soldiers from the temple, while the ownership of the surrounding 4.6 kilometres was left unresolved. During the last 46 years Thailand has shown little interest in helping to preserve the temple. Khmer Rouge forces seized it in 1993 under the noses of a Thai military base stationed nearby. Pol Pot&apos;s soldiers were not there to engage in archaeological pursuits, but to deny the Phnom Penh government control over a sacred and symbolic site as part of an insurgency backed by the Thai military. This policy of complicity with the Pol Pot forces led to further Khmer disgust with their more powerful neighbour. The centuries of accumulated grievances felt by ordinary Cambodians erupted in 2001 when they burnt down the Thai embassy in Phnom Penh. Even today, most Thais still have little or no idea why their embassy burnt down, much less why Cambodians feel that Thailand has engaged in cultural chauvinism. According to several Thai historians, Thai schools teach a very partisan version of events in which Cambodia&apos;s vast contributions to Thai culture and society are scarcely mentioned, much less acknowledged. Historian and author Professor Thongchai Winichakul recently said he believed the Preah Vihear World Heritage issue &quot;has gone beyond technicalities. It is abused to arouse delusion that the temple belongs to Thailand and a desire to revive the claim. The purpose is to generate hatred in Thai politics.&quot; Ultimately, World Heritage sites like Preah Vihear are supposed to transcend national squabbles and boost conservation efforts in both Thailand and Cambodia. But despite Thailand&apos;s rapid economic progress, this centuries-old vendetta drags on.", "publicationDate": "2008-07-15T19:00:00Z", "tags": ["Cambodia", "Thailand", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/15/cambodia.thailand", "title": "Tom Fawthrop: The row over Preah Vihear has simmered for hundreds of years", "sentences": ["It was finally awarded World Heritage status this month, despite fierce protests from ardent Thai nationalists and the parliamentary opposition in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Tensions over a disputed border temple escalated yesterday after a Cambodian official claimed 40 troops from neighbouring Thailand had crossed the frontier.

This is not true. Between 1927 and 1951, eight planes operated by Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services had fatal accidents, costing 62 lives. Half of these were during the second world war involving Qantas planes seconded to the Australian air force. What is true is that the Australian carrier has never lost a jet plane in a major crash, and it has not had a fatal crash since 1951. However, this jealously guarded reputation for safety has come under strain.     Qantas had a near-miss in Thailand. Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty    In September 1999, Qantas Flight 1 overran the runway while landing at Bangkok airport during a heavy thunderstorm and ended up on a golf course. The airline paid a reported $100m to repair it, way above the value of the Boeing 747-400, apparently so it could preserve its &quot;never lost a jet&quot; status. It was one of three incidents involving Qantas Boeing 747s within the space of eight months. A few weeks earlier, a pilot scraped an engine along the runway when he came in to land at Perth airport during heavy turbulence. Seven months later, a landing gear strut collapsed as a plane taxied for take-off at Rome airport. There has been media scrutiny of Qantas&apos;s outsourced maintenance programme. A leaked audit carried out last year of the airline&apos;s maintenance contractor in Singapore raised questions about whether it was meeting its own safety standards and those of the civil aviation regulator. Last month, according to the Age newspaper of Melbourne, a Qantas 737 returned from overseas maintenance with 60 defects. The first loss of a jet carrying the airline&apos;s livery could be announced soon. In February, a heavy landing by a Qantaslink Boeing 717 at Nhulunbuy airport in the Northern Territory wrinkled the airliner&apos;s skin and may have damaged its frame. The huge cost of repair is expected to leave it a write-off, taking with it the airline&apos;s right to say it &quot;we have never lost a jet in a crash&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2008-07-25T10:31:56Z", "tags": ["Australia news", "Airline industry", "World news", "Travel", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/25/australia.theairlineindustry", "title": "Airline that has never lost a jet", "sentences": ["Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty    In September 1999, Qantas Flight 1 overran the runway while landing at Bangkok airport during a heavy thunderstorm and ended up on a golf course."]}, {"article": "It was January 2001 and I was training students to teach English as a foreign language. The year before, when I&apos;d arrived in Bangkok, the newspaper headlines were full of reports about Eric Rosser, a convicted paedophile from America. He was due to stand trial for child molestation, rape and pornography, but had jumped bail and escaped. I&apos;d like to say it was easy to spot something strange about Peter Hill when he showed up in my class. But it wasn&apos;t like that at all. He was quiet at first; he&apos;d sit alone, reading the Bangkok Post, and never went outside during breaks like my other pupils. But once he got into the swing of class, everyone liked him. He was personable, an average-looking guy in his 40s. He was clean, neat and did his homework on time. On the first day of class, I asked my 10 students to pair up, interview each other and introduce their partner. Peter&apos;s partner told us that Peter was a musician. He wanted to help Thai people, and the best way to do that was to teach English to children. Next morning, I sat next to Peter during break to chat. He said he was a British citizen. I asked why he didn&apos;t have a British accent and he said he&apos;d moved to the US aged five. I asked if he had a green card and he said he didn&apos;t need one. I knew that he did, but I changed the subject by asking the class to go upstairs. Soon after, I asked the trainees what classes they wanted to teach. I could always guess what they&apos;d choose: men preferred adult conversation and business classes; women enjoyed teaching children. I was right about all the trainees, except Peter - he wanted to teach 10- to 12-year-old children. At this point, I felt uneasy, but nothing more - until one Sunday evening a few weeks later. I was watching the TV show America&apos;s Most Wanted, and halfway through was the story of Eric Rosser, one of the FBI&apos;s 10 Most Wanted. There he was, on television. I was in shock; I couldn&apos;t believe it. This man was in my classroom every day, hoping to get a job teaching young children. Worse still, I knew I couldn&apos;t tell anyone. I had to act on my own. If &quot;Peter&quot; thought anyone knew who he really was, he would run. I had to gather more information. I didn&apos;t want to go straight to the FBI unless I was sure I had the right man. I couldn&apos;t bear the idea of making a mistake and ruining someone&apos;s life. All my life, I&apos;d been a detective fan and read so many whodunits, so I spent a long time thinking about how I&apos;d get the right information. I told the trainees I needed copies of their passports for my files. They all brought them in, except Peter, who had only a photocopy. His British passport showed that his birthday was July 8, but he&apos;d told me it was January 17. The FBI&apos;s wanted poster had the same birthday: January 17 1958. I started a special file on him. I even brought my camera and told my class that I kept photos of each group I trained. I got his fingerprints, a tape of his voice and handwriting samples.  Then I called the FBI. We arranged to meet and they asked me to bring everything I had. When I showed Agent Robson the passport copy, she gasped, &quot;It&apos;s him. It&apos;s him.&quot; She went to see Agent Cahill, who was also on the case. He called me later and asked about Peter. &quot;What does he usually wear? What time does he usually arrive at the college? What direction does he come from?&quot;  Rosser arrived at 9.45am the next morning. I knew the police would turn up any minute and I was nervous. How would he react? Would he try to run away?  Soon enough, six policemen came, along with the FBI. As they took him away, he turned and shouted, &quot;It&apos;s all lies! I&apos;m really a good person!&quot; I&apos;ll remember those words for the rest of my life. Especially the way he looked. He was shouting but pleading at the same time. It was spooky. I felt sorry for him in a way - there were so many mixed emotions I still find difficult to explain. Of course, I never saw him again. A month later I found out that Rosser had been convicted of all the charges against him in Thailand and the US. He&apos;ll be out in 2018, something I try not to think about too much.  The police told me that Rosser thought his Thai wife had shopped him to the FBI. I think he probably knows by now that it wasn&apos;t. I just wonder if he knows it was me. \u00b7 Do you have an experience to share?

But devotees across Asia could be taking their life into their hands every time they go to a temple to pray, according to a study by a Thai doctor. Burning joss sticks lit as an offering in shrines and temples fill the air with cancer-causing toxins that are every bit as deadly as traffic fumes and cigarette smoke, says Dr Manoon Leechawengwong. Dr Manoon, who has just completed a two-year study of temple workers tasked with clearing the smouldering sticks, found the cocktail of chemicals in the smoke put them at risk of leukaemia, lung, blood and bladder cancers. &quot;One joss stick creates the same amount of cancer-causing chemicals at one cigarette,&quot; said Dr Manoon, who led the research. &quot;I knew there would be some carcinogens, but I was surprised by the levels.&quot; Joss sticks are a type of incense used in worship in many Asian countries. In Buddhism they are believed to aid spiritual communication and serve as an offering. Dr Manoon&apos;s study was conducted among 40 workers in three temples at Ayutthaya, Chachoengsao and Samut Prakan, sites chosen deliberately far from Bangkok&apos;s traffic pollution. The findings were compared with another 25 people living in a joss-stick free environment. Temple workers were exposed to high levels of benzene, also known as petroleum ether, related to leukaemia; butadiene involved in blood cancer; and benzo[a]pyrene that can cause lung, bladder and skin cancers. The level of benzene in the temple workers was four times higher than normal, butadiene was 260 times higher, and benzo[a]pyrene - the most dangerous carcinogen - 63 times greater. Analysis of the temple workers blood and urine samples discovered damage to their DNA, with a correspondingly lower capacity of their bodies to repair that damage. &quot;We know from our study that there&apos;s DNA damage,&quot; said Dr Manoon. &quot;But what we don&apos;t know is if they will develop cancer. Certainly they have a greater risk. It&apos;s like smoking. Not all smokers get cancer, it&apos;s about 20% .&quot; But Dr Manoon urges worshippers to reduce the risks by extinguishing the scented joss stick immediately after use, rather than leaving it standing pots of sand as it burns down. Manufacturers could also produce sticks that burn for a minute or less. &quot;It&apos;s not necessary as part of the ritual for these traditional joss sticks to burn down,&quot; he said. &quot;By putting them out after a minute or so the air pollution would be cut by 30 to 40 times.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-07-30T11:51:55Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Religion", "Health", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/30/health", "title": "Burning joss sticks 'as deadly as traffic fumes or cigarette smoke'", "sentences": ["Dr Manoon&apos;s study was conducted among 40 workers in three temples at Ayutthaya, Chachoengsao and Samut Prakan, sites chosen deliberately far from Bangkok&apos;s traffic pollution."]}, {"article": "Avram Grant has publicly stated his conviction that Luiz Felipe Scolari will claim the Premier League title for Chelsea, though his diplomacy has not been matched by his former charges after Nicolas Anelka became the latest player to criticise the Israeli&apos;s reign at Stamford Bridge. Grant, lecturing a group of Thailand Premier League representatives in Bangkok, insisted that Chelsea under Scolari are stronger than the other title contenders. &quot;In the last few months there have been big changes at Chelsea,&quot; he said. &quot;I think they are now better than Manchester United or Arsenal. Scolari is a good coach and can bring success. Chelsea have a good chance of winning the Premier League.&quot; The Israeli was sacked having narrowly failed to deliver silverware on three fronts - the Carling Cup and Champions League finals were lost, while Chelsea finished two points adrift in the Premier League - despite having signed a four-year contract midway through last season. He is still contesting the compensation package on offer from his former employers with no agreement reached as yet. Yet while Grant has been stoically tactful since departing the club in May, his former players have broken ranks in recent days to offer subtle criticisms of his eight-month reign. John Terry stated earlier this week that Chelsea now boast &quot;a manager who can lead the team as well&quot;, while Scolari himself suggested that Florent Malouda, a \u00a313.6m signing from Lyon last summer, had been &quot;wasted&quot; last season. Anelka&apos;s complaints were more specific. The France international was the only signing Grant made who featured in the first team, the striker having moved from Bolton in January for \u00a315m, yet managed only two goals in his first five months at the club. His form was not helped by the manager&apos;s insistence on using him as a wide attacker in a front three, most often flanking Didier Drogba, with his season culminating in the decisive penalty miss in the European Cup shoot-out in Moscow against Manchester United. &quot;I&apos;d never played on the right or the left since first coming to England, and it was all new to me,&quot; said Anelka, who has scored twice under Scolari during a pre-season tour of China and Malaysia. &quot;It was difficult because, when you come to a new club, you want to play in your best position and you&apos;re desperate for success. For it to be such a new role when I arrived from Bolton made things harder. Perhaps the new manager will understand me better. &quot;I know what I want. I want to play in my position ... I have enjoyed this pre-season tour so far because I have been playing up front, somewhere I didn&apos;t play last year. There is a very good chance I will be starting in my natural position next season, and ... I see no reason why I can&apos;t show my quality at Chelsea.&quot; Anelka returned to Moscow with his team-mates last night for the Railways Cup, which begins with a game against Lokomotiv tomorrow, attempting to exorcise the demons of that defeat in May. While the focus at the time was on Terry, whose penalty would have claimed Chelsea their first European Cup had it been converted, it was the Frenchman who suffered the indignity of missing the last spot-kick and therefore handed United the trophy. &quot;I didn&apos;t want to take it,&quot; he added. &quot;That&apos;s why I was sixth or seventh up. For John it was hard [to miss] ...I was new so, for me, I think it was more difficult. But, sometimes, you have bad moments in your life.

There have, of course, been loads of my namesakes; the steroid-smuggling silver medallist has been around for aeons now, and the perhaps heretical Bishop of Durham hung up his mitre 14 years ago - though not before I, then a toiler on a religious affairs programme for Granada TV, had him deliver a 10-minute homily to camera solely so that the credits could read, &quot;Presented by David Jenkins ... Researched by David Jenkins&quot;. As for the David Jenkins who wrote a pre-Lonely Planet guide to Laos - well, I remember shuffling down the main street in Vientiane one sultry day in 1975 with my friend Bruce Palling, then the BBC&apos;s stringer in Bangkok. A young man approached: &quot;David Jenkins!&quot; cried Palling. &quot;Meet David Jenkins.&quot; Perhaps it was that David Jenkins the Jakarta Foreign Correspondents&apos; Club were looking for when they emailed me a couple of months ago, asking if I had been their founder back in the 70s. They&apos;d lost touch with me (or him) and was I him (or me, if you see what I mean). I wasn&apos;t, but if that David Jenkins is out there, the chaps are looking for you. But this new David Jenkins ... He writes for Time Out, as I used to, and he writes about film, as I have done. At first, I shrugged it off; it was, it&apos;s true, mildly embarrassing to have friends ask if I had really liked some particularly dour example of Slovenian cinema, but I could rise above it. After all, when I had first hit the London magazine scene in the early 70s there was another and much revered David Jenkins on the scene, operating as features editor of Nova, the hip &apos;n&apos; happening periodical of the time.  Anyway, that David Jenkins didn&apos;t seem to pay any heed to my acidulous scribbling in IT and Time Out. Indeed, the only contact I had with him was tangential: I once met an attractive young woman at a noisy party. &quot;Hello,&quot; I shouted, &quot;I&apos;m David Jenkins.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; she yelled, &quot;I divorced him last week.&quot; She was, of course, Valerie Jenkins, now Valerie Grove, sometime writer for all the best newspapers as well as the acclaimed biographer of Dodie Smith and John Mortimer. In fact, it&apos;s just possible that her David Jenkins had reacted to the hot breath of my hackish prose for he had by then given up journalism in favour of writing books - first, Black Zion, about Judaism in Africa, and then a study of Patti Hearst that took him to California and marriage to June, who ran the San Francisco Women&apos;s Choir. That didn&apos;t last, and he ended up in Kyoto, translating haikus. He died, much mourned, in 2000. So, I decided to take a lofty view of the new David Jenkins. Or I pretended to: actually, the frequency of being asked, &quot;Is it you who writes that stuff for Time Out?&quot; was beginning to grate. And then came the remake of Flight of the Red Balloon. The 1961 original was itself a byword for nauseating sentimentality but it was at least well made. This year&apos;s version wasn&apos;t just pass-the-sickbag-Alice twee, it was also abysmal. And David Jenkins liked it. Loved it. Raved about it. I had to do something. I&apos;d already tried to mess with his mind a little by writing a piece on mumbling in the movies for G2, wondering how he&apos;d feel when he saw a piece about film, under his name, that he hadn&apos;t written. Would he pale? Think he&apos;d turned to automatic writing, in his sleep? Start worrying about his alcohol consumption? He&apos;d be forgetting his own name next. Then I started publishing pieces about my drug-addled days on the hippy trail; let&apos;s see how he&apos;d like to be thought of as a 60-year-old man in a young man&apos;s body.  It wasn&apos;t enough. So I phoned Tony Elliott, who owns Time Out and whom I&apos;ve known for a long time. What was this David Jenkins like, I asked. Tony emailed me a photo of my doppelganger: fresh-faced, trusting, kind - clearly not me. But I&apos;d scratched the itch; I had to know more. I had to meet him. So I phoned Time Out and I got his voicemail and it said, &quot;This is David Jenkins,&quot; and I said, &quot;This is David Jenkins,&quot; and he called back, and we made a date. And I prepared myself. I phoned Andrew Martin, journalist and author of the excellent Jim Stringer novels. He had an authorial namesake, didn&apos;t he? Two, actually: one who writes about sport and one called Andy Martin: &quot;Thank God, it&apos;s sufficiently distinct.&quot; He paused, and then summoned up the mildly dyspeptic attitude with which he faces the world. &quot;Actually, he&apos;s a rather good-looking blond chap who&apos;s a very good surfer and a Cambridge don. So when people talk to me, you can sense their rising disappointment when they realise I&apos;m not him.&quot; He sighed and told me that his father had nearly called him Martin Martin; he wished he had. Later he sent me a lugubrious email. Since we&apos;d spoken he&apos;d read an article about Cy Twombly; there was a name. Then there&apos;s the Duncan Campbell who writes for this paper. He&apos;s famously confused with Duncan Campbell, the expert on espionage and surveillance. Once, Guardian Duncan told me, they&apos;d worked together on a story about arms dealers. When they went to interview their subjects, espionage Duncan said, &quot;Hi, I&apos;m Duncan Campbell and this is my colleague, Duncan Campbell.&quot; Their interviewees never recovered their poise. At one point espionage Duncan used to write for the New Statesman while Guardian Duncan played for the Statesman cricket team. Opponents would ask Guardian Duncan how to tell if their phones were tapped and be shocked when he said he hadn&apos;t got a clue. Each has been invited to lecture, only to discover that their audience was expecting the other Duncan Campbell. And of course Guardian Duncan has long been the partner of Julie Christie; a South African magazine once ran a &quot;where is she now?&quot; piece, illustrated by two photographs. One showed a former Christie boyfriend, Warren Beatty, gorgeous in bow tie and dinner jacket; the other showed espionage Duncan, in glasses, on a bike, wearing a nerdy university-style striped scarf. &quot;From this (Beatty) to this (Campbell)&quot; the caption read. Who else? Well, Natasha Walter had a younger Natasha Walter snapping at her journalistic heels, but her double got married and changed her name. But, still in the world of letters, there are Dan Franklin, publishing director of Jonathan Cape, and Dan Franklin, assistant editor at Canongate, who on his first day at work was made to ring up his grander namesake. In fact Franklin Major suspects Canongate hired Franklin Minor so that Franklin Minor would get Big Dan&apos;s emails. Big Dan also gleefully remembers a launch party he gave that was attended by him, little Dan and Dan Franklin, the august writer for the Economist. All those I spoke to seemed to accept the situation with good grace, but it was chipping away at my sense of authenticity. When I finally met the young David Jenkins, how would I cope? In the flesh, he seemed a very pleasant fellow - if a little insensitive. An example: he had, he said, been told by his tutors on the City University journalism course that &quot;there is another, big David Jenkins&quot; out there, writing, but he&apos;d soldiered on regardless. What, I asked, if he had been called Martin Amis? &quot;Oh yeah, of course I&apos;d have changed my name. Or if I&apos;d been called Brad Pitt - it&apos;s not going to do me any favours.&quot; (Too right, sonny. In fact, it reminds me of the experience my friend Charles Sturridge had at LA airport. &quot;So, you&apos;re a film director, are you?&quot; said the immigration officer. &quot;Yes,&quot; said Charles. &quot;Why do you ask?&quot; &quot;Well, I write scripts,&quot; said the official, entry stamp in hand. &quot;And what&apos;s your name,&quot; asked Charles, smarmily. &quot;Paul Newman,&quot; the officer replied, &quot;but I can&apos;t call myself that.&quot;) My David Jenkins had sound views on Eric Rohmer, a wobblier take on Jean-Luc Godard and a very po-faced attitude to Judd Apatow. What else? He had never met anyone of the same name before, and he had never read Scoop, Evelyn Waugh&apos;s brilliant satire of journalism, the plot of which turns on one namesake being sent to do the other namesake&apos;s job. That piece on mumbling in the movies? &quot;It was the first time I got general recognition from my peers - lots of emails, phone messages. That was pretty exciting.&quot; And someone had come up to him in the Time Out lift and congratulated him on a profile of Eva Green I&apos;d written for Vogue - that had been amusing. He was, he said, enjoying our meeting, now; when he had got my call, he had thought it all a bit mysterious. Indeed, he and his section editor had worried that I might serve a writ on him. His background? Born in Edmonton, lives in Highbury and Islington with his girlfriend, read history at Liverpool, wrote some DVD reviews there for the student newspaper: &quot;Golly!&quot; he said. &quot;The first time you see your name in print ...&quot; Make that my name, buster. I had one more thing to ask him about. A friend of mine had mentioned a travel piece about Havana, by David Jenkins. It didn&apos;t, she said, seem much like me ... I&apos;d called the piece up online, and pretty ropey it was too. And at the end it had said, &quot;David Jenkins&apos; debut novel, The Four-Letter Countries, is published by ...&quot;  So, I said to my newfound namesake, what&apos;s this novel of yours about? &quot;What novel?&quot; he said. &quot;I thought that was you.&quot; It wasn&apos;t me, and it wasn&apos;t him, and it wasn&apos;t in fact a novel; but there is a travel book out there, called The Four-Letter Countries, and it&apos;s being plugged on the radio by yet another David Jenkins. And he&apos;s not the steroid smuggler. And he&apos;s not the bishop. And he&apos;s not the men&apos;s figure-skating champion of the 1950s.

Pojaman Shinawatra, 51, a major political and business figure, looked stunned as a judge in Bangkok&apos;s criminal court passed the sentence. Her stepbrother, Bhanapot Damapong, and secretary were also sentenced to jail for the 1997 deal, which had been scrutinised and dismissed by Thailand&apos;s constitutional court while Thaksin was in office. &quot;The actions by the three defendants are serious violations of the law,&quot; said judge Pramote Pipatpramote as he read today&apos;s verdict. &quot;The court has decided the three defendants were guilty of tax fraud.&quot; All three were given bail of five million baht (\u00a375,000) and allowed to leave the court - a smiling Pojaman flanked by her son and two daughters - into a throng of 500 cheering supporters outside. A lawyer for Pojaman said she would appeal against the sentence. But the conviction is a major blow for Thaksin, who returned from self-imposed exile following the 2006 coup that ousted him, vowing to clear his name of corruption allegations. Thaksin, 59, who bought Manchester City football club during his 17 months out of the country, faces three abuse of power cases before the supreme court. He is due to testify in August in another case involving his wife, who is accused of using her husband&apos;s influence to buy a piece of prime Bangkok land from the state at one-third of its estimated value. They face 13 years in jail if convicted. After today&apos;s hearing, Thaksin&apos;s spokesman, Pongthep Thepkanjana, said the former prime minister and his wife were not concerned about the verdict. &quot;Thaksin is not disheartened,&quot; said Pongthep. &quot;They respect the court ruling but it is not the end. We will fight until the end.&quot; Pojaman, who appeared in a dark suit and wearing a string of pearls, has 30 days to appeal as do the other defendants. It could take up to five years to exhaust all legal avenues. The allegations focus on a transfer of shares in Shinawatra Computers, later to become Shin Corp. It was Thailand&apos;s biggest telecoms firm before its sale for almost \u00a31bn in 2006. In 1997, the Shinawatra family listed the transfer as worth about \u00a311 million in shares. Share transfers within the stock market are exempt from capital gains tax. But after Thaksin was deposed in the 2006 coup amid allegations of rampant corruption, Thailand&apos;s assets examination committee took a fresh look at the deal and the family altered its story. Pojaman claimed she bought the shares from a family maid and transferred them to her adopted brother as a gift, which is tax-exempt. But the committee discovered the cheque to the maid was deposited in a bank account belonging to Pojaman. The committee said Pojaman and her brother misrepresented the deal to evade taxes and was liable for back dues of \u00a38.2m.

Beijing Downtown Backpackers Accommodation Visitors to this charismatic part of old Beijing should not kid themselves that they are taking a potter through the past; the street was given an old-world makeover after the area became popular, reinventing itself faster than a gap year student. So, like the ubiquitous T-shirt says, it is &quot;same, same, but different&quot; and now lined with funky boutiques, bars, cafes and restaurants making it a favourite haunt for Beijing&apos;s foreign residents and visitors alike. This well-run backpackers offers free breakfast and is the pick of the street&apos;s crop of hostels, attracting a young crowd who can get rowdy in the basement bar despite nearby competition from many pubs and Beijing&apos;s best music venue, MAO Livehouse.  \u00b7 Dorms RMB65/75 (200/300); double RMB190-300 (RMB1,000-1,500). 85 Nanluoguxiang, Dongcheng District; +86 10 8400 2429; downtown@backpackingchina.com; backpackingchina.com 4. Saga International Youth Hostel Located up a quiet side street, this hostel is well placed for cheap eating options and handy for the CBD, yet a 20-minute tramp away from Beijing&apos;s underground rail network and a good walk from the main train station. A small common area offers TV, internet and a caf\u00e9 selling the usual backpacker fare; but the rooms are relatively cheap and clean. If this is full, walk 200 metres up the road to the New Dragon Hostel, more of a hotel, but slightly cheaper and just as good. \u00b7 Dorm RMB65 (RMB328); Private room RMB198-288 (880-1,380RMB).

Drum Tower Youth Hostel This favourite is situated on ancient Beijing&apos;s prestigious north-south axis, which runs from the west gate of the Temple of Heaven, through the centre of the Forbidden City to the north and what is now the main Olympic site. A great location (near Houhai and across the road from the Drum and Bell Towers and the city&apos;s surviving hutong districts) offers pottering potential; the hostel also has good clean and air-conditioned rooms - essential in Beijing&apos;s humid summer \u2013 as well as a full range of services that can include airport pick-ups. As Olympic fever has clearly affected the management&apos;s pricing policy, a good bet might be the adjoining 7 Days Inn \u2013 a chain hotel that is, remarkably, cheaper, probably because they saved so much on the sub-Ikea decor. \u00b7 Dorm RMB55 (RMB220); Double with bathroom RMB180 (RMB900); Triple room RMB260 (RMB1,000). 51 Jiu Gulou Dajie, Xicheng District; +86 10 6403 7702/9907; drumtowerutels@hotmail.com \u00b7 7 Days Inn 47 Jiu Gulou Dajie, Xicheng District; +86 10 6405 8818; 7daysinn.cn; Double room RMB248 (RMB847)  6. Perfect Inn The Perfect Inn may fall short of its ambitious title, but it is friendly, well appointed and has a good location on a street of restaurants and music, clothes and computer shops. The clean rooms are equipped with a bathroom, TV and air-conditioning; breakfast is free and the reception offers all the services one expects from a well-run small hotel. The big screen TV lounge will show Olympic coverage every night and an open bar is promised on opening and closing nights.  \u00b7 281 Gulou Dong Dajie, Dongcheng District; +86 10 6401 3699 / +86 10 8402 3699; standard deluxe RMB340-400 deluxe (RMB1400-2000)perfectinn@live.com; beijingperfectinn.com   7. City Central Youth Hostel The City Central Youth Hostel is big, anonymous and soulless, but it&apos;s wide range of facilities more than make up for any lack of character and the fact that its name makes it sound like a jail. A location right opposite the main train station make this a good no-nonsense option. The fact that City Central isn&apos;t crammed into a picturesque hutong is its biggest advantage \u2013 the rooms are a bit bigger and it will still have rooms while the cutesy places fill up first. \u00b7 Dorms RMB50-70 (RMB300); Single RMB140 (RMB800); Double RMB298 (RMB1,200); Deluxe RMB368 (RMB1,848)1-5 Beijingzhan Qianxijie, Dongcheng District; + 86 10 8511 5050, + 86 10 6525 8866/8066; reserve@centralhostel.com; centralhostel.com  8. Leo Hostel Cheap prices, a great location near Tiananmen Sq and a friendly atmosphere ensure that this hostel is full all the time; so come the Olympics space is going to be tight. The level of capital expenditure needed in the Olympic city will keep the stingiest backpackers out of Beijing until September, leaving places like this up for grabs for those who just don&apos;t want to fork out for a hotel \u2013 but make sure you book, and pay, ahead. Leo Hostel ticks all the usual boxes, and the English-speaking staff seem keen to sort out any request you may have.  \u00b7 Dorm RMB45-70(RMB225-350); Double RMB240 (RMB1,100); Triple RMB300 (RMB1,500).

Golden Pineapple Youth Hostel If you book a bed at this spotlessly clean new opening, you may well be the first person to ever sleep in it. Two months after they first threw open their doors, the Golden Pineapple is still empty, despite being the best place to stay in the vicinity. And what a location \u2013 tucked away up a quiet, leafy side street between Dongzhimen and Dongsi Shitiao subway stops, the hotel is a five-minute walk from Olympic football venue, the Workers&apos; Stadium, boxing venue, the Workers&apos; Gymnasium and a short stumble home from Sanlitun, Beijing&apos;s nightlife district. Not that you necessarily need to head out on the town \u2013 the hotel has a great attached bar with dive bar prices, cosy booths and a free pool table \u2013 all it&apos;s missing is punters.  \u00b7 Dorm RMB70 (RMB240); double RMB320-480 (RMB960-1,440); Two adjoining rooms - family suite RMB680 (RMB2,040).18 Xinzhong Jie (beside supermarket next to Sun City building, opposite No 55 Middle School), Dongcheng District; +86 10 8447 2899; bih-yh@sohu.cm; utels.com 10. Harbour Inn The Harbour Inn is not going to win any prizes for its d\u00e9cor; but it is very cheap, sort of cheerful and relatively comfortable, not to mention conveniently located opposite Gulou tube station, two ring roads directly south of the Bird&apos;s Nest. The cheapest rooms are windowless cells familiar to anyone who has stayed at the bad end of Bangkok&apos;s Khao San Road; the better rooms have a view of the grass growing through next door&apos;s ancient roof. But the owners have tempered their Olympic greed from shameless avarice to mild opportunism and have roughly quadrupled the price of the rooms, so they remain relatively affordable \u2013 just make sure you have a packed itinerary as this is no place to kill time.  \u00b7 Dorms RMB50 (none during Olympics) Double room with bathroom RMB180 (RMB640); 18 Yuge Hutong, Jiu Gulou Dajie, Dongcheng District; +86 10 8402 5925; harbourinnbj@hotmail.com; beijingharbourinn.com", "publicationDate": "2008-07-31T08:52:55Z", "tags": ["Beijing holidays", "Hotels", "Budget travel", "Top 10s", "China holidays", "Travel", "Olympics 2008", "Hostels", "Olympic Games"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/jul/31/beijing.hotels", "title": "Top 10 hostels in Olympic Beijing", "sentences": ["The cheapest rooms are windowless cells familiar to anyone who has stayed at the bad end of Bangkok&apos;s Khao San Road; the better rooms have a view of the grass growing through next door&apos;s ancient roof."]}, {"article": "The Newcastle United midfielder Joey Barton has been charged with violent conduct by the Football Association following his assault on Ousmane Dabo 15 months ago. The 25-year-old was given a four-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, on July 1 after admitting assault occasioning actual bodily harm on his former Manchester City team-mate during a training session in May last year. The new charge from the FA comes as a result of that hearing at Manchester crown court after football&apos;s governing body received all the relevant documentation from the case. Barton has until August 13 to respond to the charge. There is no maximum sentence which could be issued to Barton by the FA and, given the severity of the attack on Dabo. a lengthy ban and possible fine would be the likely outcome were he found culpable. The case will be heard by an independent regulatory commission on an as yet unspecified date. It is understood that the FA will strongly contest any claim by Barton that further punishment for the offence would be a case of &apos;double jeopardy&apos;, given that an employee in any industry would expect to suffer professionally for a criminal offence committed at work. Newcastle responded to the charge by questioning why they should be penalised for an incident which took place so long ago, and while the player was at a different club. &quot;Newcastle United can confirm that it has received documentation from the Football Association stating that it is charging Joey Barton with misconduct in relation to the incident that occurred with Ousmane Dabo in May 2007, at a time when he was a registered player of Manchester City,&quot; read the statement. &quot;The club has sought clarification from the Football Association as to why this decision has been reached now, given the incident occurred nearly 15 months ago. Joey will be requesting a personal hearing in relation to the charge and the club will be making no further comment on the matter at this time.&quot; For its part, the FA insists its hands were tied while the criminal investigation was ongoing, and that with no video footage of the incident, they were unable to interview players who were central to the police&apos;s case. The midfielder was released from Strangeways prison in Manchester on Monday after serving less than three months of a six-month sentence for a separate charge of assault. There is no direct precedent for a case of this nature. When Eyal Berkovic was kicked in the head by his West Ham United team-mate John Hartson during a training session in October 1998, he was fined \u00a320,000 and banned for three matches the following February. And when then Manchester City defender Ben Thatcher knocked out Portsmouth&apos;s Pedro Mendes with a forearm smash during a game two years ago he was banned for eight games, with a further 15 suspended for two years.  It is believed the Dabo incident is regarded at Soho Square to be of at least equal severity, although it will be up to the independent commission to decide if the two attacks are comparable.  The FA&apos;s charge comes three days after Barton was released from Strangeways prison in Manchester after serving 74 days of a six-month sentence for beating up a teenager in Liverpool city centre last December. Newcastle wasted no time in offering their support to the controversial midfielder who earned a solitary England cap in February 2007 although Barton&apos;s boot sponsor, Nike, yesterday confirmed it had terminated its deal with the player.  Barton&apos;s career has been dogged with trouble.

Pojaman Shinawatra, 51, looked stunned as a judge in Bangkok&apos;s criminal court handed down the sentence. It could herald disaster for Thaksin, who faces a series of unrelated corruption charges. Her stepbrother, Bhanapot Damapong, and secretary were also jailed for the 1997 deal. &quot;The actions by the three defendants are serious violations of the law,&quot; said Judge Pramote Pipatpramote as he read yesterday&apos;s verdict. All three were given bail of 5m baht (\u00a375,000) and allowed to leave court - into a throng of 500 cheering supporters outside. A lawyer for Pojaman said she would appeal. But the conviction is a major blow for Thaksin, who returned from exile vowing to clear his name of corruption allegations. With his People&apos;s Power party allies in office, analysts say Thaksin thought the charges would be dismissed. But the judges, whose powers were increased after the coup which ousted Thaksin in 2006, have shown an independent streak unusual in Thailand. Thaksin, 59, now faces three cases centring on allegations of abuse of power. This month he is also due to testify in another case involving his wife, who is accused of using her husband&apos;s influence to buy a piece of Bangkok land from the state at one-third of the estimated value. They face 13 years in jail if convicted.

All while drinking gin and tonic and serving Ferrero Rochers. And possibly playing bridge. Or croquet. But when Tom Carter, the new British high commissioner to Zambia, takes up his post at the end of the month, his wife, Carolyn Davidson, will not be scuttling about in the background. She will be running the show. That&apos;s because although Carter has the top job, so does Davidson. They are the first married couple to job-share a head of mission posting at a British embassy or high commission. It&apos;s quite a development. As recently as 1972, women were expected to give up their Foreign Office jobs when they got married. The first British woman to serve as a head of mission was Eleanor Emery, who was appointed high commissioner to Botswana in 1973. Though senior women diplomats are not so rare these days - 23 women lead British missions abroad, out of a total of 189 - the Foreign Office said Carter and Davidson are unique. Unlike a more conventional job-share, where both parties divide a week between them, Carter and Davidson have opted to divvy the year up into thirds, each doing a four-month stint before handing the high commission keys over. And they have decided that when they and their two sons, Matthew, eight, and Mark, 10, touch down in Lusaka in three weeks, it will be Davidson, 44, who will get to be the first high commissioner. So while she busies herself with being the diplomatic queen bee, Carter, 54, will resign himself to being &quot;simply&quot; her spouse. Which, the pair are keen to stress, is far from a glorified house-husband role, and is a full-time job in itself. &quot;The spouse has traditionally carried a major burden and has contributed to the success of the other half&apos;s job,&quot; said Carter. &quot;I suspect being the spouse will, in some way, be every bit as a challenging as being high commissioner.&quot; No power but lots of tedious responsibility seems to be the spouse&apos;s lot. An unfailing ability to feign interest in the face of abject tedium is essential, according to Brigid Keenan, a seasoned ambassador&apos;s wife who wrote a book, Diplomatic Baggage: The Adventures of a Trailing Spouse, about her adventures. &quot;[One] trial of being a diplomat&apos;s wife is having to make polite conversation at these terrible dinner parties. I remember in Syria I found myself at a table with the Indian ambassador and some other people who didn&apos;t speak very good English. There was a deathly silence that I thought I should fill, so I started talking about markets in different countries. I was gabbling away about potatoes when I suddenly noticed that the Indian ambassador had fallen asleep,&quot; said Keenan. &quot;Once I started to tell the story of the Pied Piper of Hamlin and all the people on my table thought that it was something that had happened last week and that this terrible paedophile had made off with all these children.&quot; Nonetheless, the couple are optimistic they will still be able to enjoy free time when not being the boss. As well as spending time with their sons, both are keen to crack on with their Open University courses - the pair have opted to study for the same qualification, an MBA, which they feel will dovetail nicely with their day job. You often meet unhappy diplomatic spouses who are quietly resentful of what they have had to forego so that their partner can carry on globetrotting - to work for the Foreign Office you have to agree to move country every couple of years. The joy of this new arrangement, say the couple, is that they both end up fulfilled. &quot;So often in Foreign Office marriages there is perhaps one less-happy partner and one very-happy partner, with the less-happy partner enduring living somewhere where they don&apos;t really want to live for their partner&apos;s sake, because they know that it&apos;s exactly what he or she wants to do,&quot; said Carter. &quot;You have to have a very good marriage to be a diplomat&apos;s wife because it can be very lonely,&quot; said Keenan. Davidson added: &quot;The difficulty is that the sort of life that we lead, where you are always moving around, makes it very difficult for anyone to have a career as, say, an accountant or a lawyer. We have managed to get the best of both worlds, which is great.&quot; This is the couple&apos;s second diplomatic job-share. Five years ago, they were appointed joint deputy head of mission at the British embassy in Bratislava. The idea came about when the couple were working in Thailand in 2003. Carter was head of the British embassy&apos;s political section in Bangkok; she was working part-time in a non-diplomatic job.  &quot;We were thinking about what we would do next. We would both have horrid days in our respective environments and Tom said, well, what about doing something where we can share?&quot; said Davidson. &quot;From that grew the idea that we could apply for our next job together. Because we were both at the same level we thought we could do it as a job-share.&quot; Given the Foreign Office&apos;s rather fusty reputation, it may come as a surprise to learn that it was very supportive of the idea. &quot;I think the reason our job-share got so much support from the Foreign Office was that it ticked so many boxes,&quot; said Davidson.  The pair admit there was some scepticism in Bratislava when they rocked up as this &quot;double-headed monster&quot;, as Carter puts it. &quot;I think there was a certain amount of anxiety among staff at the embassy when they heard we were going to be coming up over the horizon. But very quickly feedback became very positive, particularly on the management side.&quot; One benefit colleagues noticed was that both were very focussed during their four-month stints. &quot;I don&apos;t know if you work harder, but if you are only working for four months you have targets for what you want to achieve within those four months. And our previous boss used to say that she got an injection of energy every four months,&quot; said Davidson. The pair really do seem to divide everything equally, even conversation. Ask them a question and they will take it in turns to answer. They claim to have never had a professional disagreement; they are simply not a quarrelsome couple and never have been, since falling in love at the British embassy (where else?) in Bonn in the early 1990s. Unsurprisingly, the arrangement has caused quite a stir in the diplomatic community, said Davidson. &quot;Certainly other diplomats that we&apos;ve met, yes they have been envious. Particularly when they have been forced to have one of them posted to one country and another to a neighbouring country and ended up having to split the family up.&quot; This was the case with their last boss, Judith Macgregor, Britain&apos;s ambassador to Slovakia, whose husband John works in Vienna 50 miles up the road, as the UK&apos;s envoy to Austria. But what do the children think? &quot;If one of our children wakes up in the night because of a scary dream or a nose bleed, they will generally get into our bed on the side of whichever of us is on home duty,&quot; Carter told the Financial Times in 2006. &quot;They just sense and accept it as it is.&quot; Both maintain they have generally been well-received. &quot;The only thing I have noticed is that I get asked a lot what on earth I do for the four months when I am not at work,&quot; said Carter. &quot;Carolyn has never been asked that.&quot; Diplomatic doubles Lord Thomas Elgin and Mary Nisbet, Countess of Elgin, enjoyed a luxury lifestyle during his tenure as British ambassador to Constantinople (1799-1803), but he is best remembered for removing from Athens the sculptures now known as the &quot;Elgin marbles&quot;.

Many airports try to funnel their passengers through one security area, but Haneda has six or seven, which means you can get from kerbside and past security in 90 seconds. It&apos;s the fourth-busiest airport in the world, but it&apos;s primarily a domestic airport, and doesn&apos;t have a massive duty-free area. Instead there&apos;s an amazing grocery store.

Police who caught the 18-year-old at the scene said he confessed to having planned the attack to find out if robbery was as easy as depicted in the violent game. Phalawat Chinno, who played the game obsessively for hours every day, bought two knives and chose his 54-year-old victim carefully as he believed he would be too old to fight back, police said. The secondary school student said the killing was a robbery that went wrong. New Era Interactive Media, the Thai distributors of Grand Theft Auto, which recently launched its fourth edition, has asked shops to withdraw copies from sale and video arcades to suspend the game. &quot;We are sending out requests ... to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games,&quot; said Sakchai Chotikachinda, the marketing director of New Era.  Three years ago the families of two police officers and a police switchboard operator gunned down in the US filed a multi-million pound lawsuit in Alabama against the game&apos;s makers and distributors. The victims were shot by an 18-year-old who played the game constantly. Thai investigators said that Phalawat - who allegedly spent eight hours choosing the pair of knives for the attack - had confessed to being inspired by Grand Theft Auto, which allows players to adopt the role of an urban criminal and engage in often violent and destructive, and sometimes murderous, crime sprees. &quot;He said he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game,&quot; the chief investigating officer, Veeravit Pipattanasak, told Reuters. Late on Saturday night Phalawat flagged down one cab, but backed out of attempting to rob the driver as there were too many people around.

Still, for the many millions whose gaze was diverted elsewhere here is a brief summary of the events leading up to the match and the great event itself: United, alerted by a recent Foreign Office warning that all British nationals should leave the Niger delta, arrived in town accompanied by a hostage negotiator; Portsmouth played Kano Pillars FC in the opening game of a three-team competition in what the local press described as a &quot;near-empty&quot; stadium; before Sunday&apos;s match, between the two English clubs, 10,000 fans rioted outside amid complaints that ticket prices were as high as 50,000 naira (\u00a3215 - almost twice the average monthly wage in Nigeria); then, to quote another local newspaper, &quot;security men had to run for their lives when they could not withstand the militancy of the spectators who forced their way into the stadium thereby causing a stampede&quot;; the 10,000 non-paying customers increased the attendance to 35,000, in a 60,000-capacity stadium; and the tournament organisers lost money. Oh yes, and United won 2-1 thanks to goals by Chris Eagles and Carlos Tevez. Most people might read this summary and conclude the Tinapa Invitational Soccer Fiesta was something of a shambles, but then most people weren&apos;t in Abuja to chaperon the United squad at the personal invitation of Sir David Richards, the chairman of the Premier League. Garth Crooks, the former Tottenham and United player, was and here is what he had to say about the event: &quot;It wasn&apos;t just a success, it was a resounding success, one of the best friendlies I have ever seen.&quot; As for crowd control problems, Sir David&apos;s man on the spot had this to say: &quot;The more chaos at matches, the more Africans enjoy it.&quot; We could spend the rest of the column discussing the casual - some might say offensive - characterisation of Africans and their alleged enjoyment of chaos at football matches but then we would have little room left to examine what might be one reason for Crooks&apos; proselytising for English teams playing against each other on foreign soil. &quot;I&apos;m in absolutely no doubt whatsoever it [the tournament] would be a success, whether in Australia, Asia or Africa,&quot; he said - a conveniently upbeat interpretation of an inconveniently chaotic weekend in Nigeria which dovetailed nicely with the news that the Premier League is considering introducing a winter break in 2011 and using the time to stage a series of &quot;mini tournaments&quot; around the globe. Thus the discredited &quot;39th game&quot; concept is reborn, albeit in a form that would not upset home-and-away symmetry which is integral to the League. Nor will those loyal fans need worry about missing a vital game because they cannot afford the flight to Bangkok. Why would they bother to travel so far for a meaningless friendly between two sets of players who would rather be spending their break on the beach in Dubai? For this we should all be thankful. We should also congratulate the Premier League for its tacit acknowledgment that its original plan was flawed and its decision to press ahead with a more modest proposal. Yet Sir David and his colleagues should move cautiously. It takes a rare kind of self-denial to herald the Tinapa Invitational Soccer Fiesta as a template for the future of English football abroad, just as it takes a dangerous self-belief to think the rest of the world is beside itself at the prospect of mid-season friendlies between Manchester United and Portsmouth, never mind Wigan and Hull City. Last weekend&apos;s shambles in Abuja should be confirmation of that, but anyone seeking conclusive proof should take a look at the Champions World Series - a series of games featuring the likes of United, Chelsea, Celtic and Barcelona staged in North America earlier this decade. Heralded as the future of soccer in the US, the series ended in ignominy as the company behind it went bankrupt. There were many reasons for this commercial failure, but the most serious was that those involved over-estimated the demand for meaningless games featuring European clubs. Bold James shows the colour of his money In the long and sometimes inglorious history of sport it is hard to think of a more cynical outlook on the world beyond the locker room than that expressed by Michael Jordan who, when asked to endorse a black Democrat candidate against a nasty, racist senator called Jesse Helms, replied: &quot;But Republicans wear sneakers too.&quot; Thus, the greatest basketball player who ever lived established the rule for other superstars who did not want to comment on political matters, among them his friend Tiger Woods, who is resolute in his refusal to engage in even the mildest form of political discourse. That is Woods&apos; right, of course, although it might be enlightening if he took the trouble to explain why, when he was the victim of racism as a youngster, he has nothing worthwhile to say on the subject of race in 21st-century America. If it is the case that the world&apos;s most recognisable athlete is concerned that by speaking out he might endanger his commercial contracts then he need worry no longer. Last month the basketball player LeBron James, seen by many as Jordan&apos;s rightful heir, donated $20,000 to the presidential election campaign of Barack Obama. Twenty-thousand dollars is loose change to James but it was enough to let the nation know where he stood. So Tiger take note: not one of James&apos; sponsors has cancelled his contract. Why Hammers got off lightly with Ljungberg Nothing will salve the pain West Ham United must be feeling today after handing Freddie Ljungberg \u00a36 million to go away, but let me try anyway. At the start of the season, the Los Angeles Dodgers gave centre-fielder Andruw Jones a two-year contract worth $18 million (\u00a39.3m) a year - the highest annual salary in the club&apos;s history. Since then Jones has produced what one newspaper columnist described this week as &quot;the worst season by a centre-fielder in major league history&quot;, as well as being christened &quot;Tubbo&quot; by no less an authority than the sports pages of the LA Times. Then there is the sad story of Barry Zito, given a $126 million (\u00a364.6m) contract to be the ace pitcher for the San Francisco Giants and who turns out to be even more useless at striking out major league batters than Ljungberg is at tormenting Premier League defences. There is little consolation to be had from the misfortune of others but it will surely come as a relief to those in charge at West Ham to know they do not have a monopoly on mindless profligacy. Goodbye and good riddance to the torch relay It is too early to argue that China&apos;s Olympics have been an overwhelming success, so we will play it safe and merely say that at least one good thing has emerged. The IOC&apos;s decision to dispense with the torch relay before the 2012 Games is welcome indeed, and not just because it is the most tangible remaining link with the Nazis who dreamed it up to adorn the 1936 Games in Berlin. The relay was commercialism dressed up as &quot;tradition&quot; - a cynical, exploitative and pretentious marketing exercise which should have been abandoned long ago. lawrence.donegan@theguardian.com", "publicationDate": "2008-08-06T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Football", "Premier League", "Sport", "European club football", "Premier League 2008-09"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/07/premierleague.manchesterunited", "title": "Forget the 39th step, the rest of the world just isn't interested", "sentences": ["Nor will those loyal fans need worry about missing a vital game because they cannot afford the flight to Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Do Chinese leaders ever wish they had never agreed to stage the Olympics? Probably not, but they may well have mixed feelings. On the plus side, China has built some nifty-looking stadiums, there has been an outpouring of national pride - especially among the young - and it sets the seal on China&apos;s ambition to be a global mover and shaker. Yet, the games have been a right pain too for the Chinese leadership. The event has turned into an irresistible magnet for human rights activists to protest many issues from Tibet to Darfur. Today, Christian activists were arrested at Tiananmen Square, where hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators were killed in 1989.  Yesterday, four pro-Tibet demonstrators were deported after unfurling Free Tibet banners on a lamp post. For groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch and celebrity campaigners such as Mia Farrow, the Olympics has been an unparalleled opportunity to get their message across about human rights abuses in China and unsavoury regimes that Beijing supports. China has had to endure criticism not just from activists but from those higher up the food chain. George Bush today had some blunt words for China saying the US firmly opposes the detention of political dissidents, human rights advocates and religious activists. It could have been worse. Bush chose to speak in Bangkok rather than waiting to arrive on Chinese soil to sound off, so as not to rub Chinese faces in the dirt. But the Chinese are notoriously thin-skinned to criticism and will not appreciate Bush&apos;s words no matter where they were said. In Chinese eyes, what countries do at home is their own business; Chinese leaders don&apos;t pass judgment on others&apos; domestic policies and they don&apos;t expect other governments to comment on China&apos;s internal affairs. This is the doctrine of state sovereignty at its most rigid.  China&apos;s sensitivity to foreign criticism can also be attributed to past humiliation at the hands of outsiders. As Orville Schell reminds us this week in the New York Review of Books:   &quot;A particularly important element in the formation of China&apos;s modern identity has been the legacy of the country&apos;s &quot;humiliation&quot; at the hands of foreigners, beginning with China&apos;s defeat in the opium wars in the mid 19th century and the shameful treatment of Chinese in America.&quot;  Little wonder then that China puts so much importance in not losing face. China of course can hit back at the likes of the US for double standards. As Bush was calling on China to allow more freedoms to its own people, Osama bin Laden&apos;s driver was convicted of supporting terrorism - although he was cleared of more serious conspiracy charges - by a much-criticised military commission at Guantanamo Bay. The Chinese may also want to remind Bush once he arrives in Beijing - gently or not so gently - that he was the one that invaded Iraq in a war that Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, called illegal. Some commentators believe that the Olympics has actually prodded China to become a better international citizen. Victor Cha this week wrote in the International Herald Tribune that China has taken away incentives for Chinese companies doing business in Sudan and cut arms sales to Burma after its crackdown last year against demonstrators, including monks. Others are downright dubious about holding the Olympics in China. In a piece for the Los Angeles Times, Heather Havrilevsky, wonders what on earth possessed Olympic organisers to award China the games. &quot;That good old Olympic spirit, set against the backdrop of the deeply depressing realities of life in China, makes this summer&apos;s festivities feel about as uplifting and cheerful as an accidental shooting at a wedding reception,&quot; she writes. The piece would have been more effective if she had not gone into overkill by talking about the &quot;systematic oppression of 1.3 billion people&quot;. That is patent nonsense. This is a country that has lifted 250 million people out of poverty in the last 30 years, which is an incredible achievement. Most of Africa would not be in such a mess if African governments had shown the same zeal in fighting poverty. As a Somali told me recently: &quot;The difference between China and Africa is that when Chinese leaders see the economic pie in front of them they want a small slice, but African leaders want the whole pie for themselves.&quot; But that is another debate. For the time being, the Olympics should be seen as a foretaste of what China can expect if it wants to assume a leadership role on the world stage. For China to expect that its domestic policies should not be criticised is totally unrealistic. Those who harbour pretensions to leadership are subject to scrutiny whether they like it or not. Notwithstanding all its past history of humiliation, China will have to acquire the political maturity to withstand criticism - fair or unfair - that comes with growing international power and prestige. Or as Truman said: &quot;If you can&apos;t take the heat get out of the kitchen.&quot; The Olympics will be a good training ground for China to endure the barbs that will come its way in the years to come.", "publicationDate": "2008-08-07T11:39:00Z", "tags": ["World news", "China", "Olympics 2008", "Sport", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2008/aug/07/theolympicsischinasowntra", "title": "Olympics is China's training ground for world leadership", "sentences": ["Bush chose to speak in Bangkok rather than waiting to arrive on Chinese soil to sound off, so as not to rub Chinese faces in the dirt."]}, {"article": "Everton are close to easing their transfer frustrations by signing the Brazil striker Vagner Love on a season&apos;s loan. The club has proposed a temporary deal for the CSKA Moscow forward with an option for a permanent \u00a315m move next summer, and Alan Smith and St\u00e9phane M&apos;Bia are also expected at Goodison Park before the transfer window closes. The 24-year-old Love is due to meet Everton officials today and will become the club&apos;s first signing of a problematic summer should he accept the personal terms on offer. Negotiations with the Russian club and Love&apos;s advisors have progressed smoothly since they opened on Friday and, despite Love&apos;s previous reluctance to leave CSKA for the Premier League, his willingness to travel to Liverpool has encouraged Everton to believe a deal could be concluded before Saturday&apos;s season opener against Blackburn. The Rio-born forward may require a work permit, however, before he is cleared to play. Though central midfielders are still the overriding priority for Everton&apos;s manager, David Moyes, who had no option but to start 17-year-old Jack Rodwell in Saturday&apos;s 1-1 draw with PSV Eindhoven, he has been left short in attack following last week&apos;s sale of Andy Johnson to Fulham, Victor Anichebe&apos;s Olympic commitments and with James Vaughan facing a possible three-match suspension for a pre-season dismissal in the United States. Love rejected the chance to join Manchester City last season but has since seen his compatriot and former CSKA strike partner Jo leave for Eastlands and may be ready to sever his ties with the Moscow club, whom he joined from Palmeiras in 2004 and where he has scored 44 goals in 90 league appearances. Everton also hope to conclude a deal of about \u00a36m for the Rennes midfielder M&apos;Bia, who has informed the French club of his wish to move to the Premier League, and the Newcastle striker Smith is close to joining Everton in a \u00a32.5m move, although the transfer is being stalled by Kevin Keegan&apos;s reluctance to lose the former England forward without a replacement at St James&apos; Park. Moyes&apos; interest in Joao Moutinho looks to be over, however, after Sporting Lisbon insisted on receiving the bulk of the \u00a318m fee up front. Fresh doubt was cast over Manchester City&apos;s financial future last night amid claims that the club&apos;s owner, the former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, would not return home to face corruption charges and is seeking exile in London. Shinawatra did not take his scheduled flight to Bangkok yesterday and Pracha Prasobdee, a member of the pro-Thaksin party that won the post-coup election in December, later announced: &quot;He will not return to Thailand again.&quot; The City owner had vowed to clear his name and thereby release about \u00a31bn of assets frozen by the Thai government last year. Without those assets Shinawatra is worth an estimated \u00a3200m and will struggle to finance his ambitions of turning City into a Champions League club.

The couple had been due to return from the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics to appear before the supreme court this morning to give evidence in a corruption case over a dubious land deal.

No mention was made of seeking political asylum in Britain, where the former telecoms billionaire owns a lavish house. He spent most of his self-imposed exile in the UK after being deposed in the bloodless 2006 coup, buying Manchester City football club for \u00a381.6m in the process. Rumours were rife that the couple would flee Thailand after Pojaman, 51, was convicted of evading millions of pounds in taxes in connection with a 1997 shares transfer deal. Aides to the family emphatically scotched the suggestion. The day after Pojaman was sentenced along with her step-brother, Bhanapot Damapong, and former secretary, Kanchanpana Honghern, Thaksin left for a speaking engagement in Japan before travelling to China. Pojaman, her step-brother and former secretary boarded a flight for Beijing on Thursday to meet Thaksin. She left with nine suitcases and was given a tearful send-off at Bangkok&apos;s airport by her three children, son Phantongtae and daughters Pinthongta and Paethontan. Thaksin&apos;s children face several corruption allegations, but it was unclear if the reference to his &quot;family&quot; in his dramatic statement meant they too had travelled to Britain to escape the charges. The divisive former prime minister, who held office for five years, said he would remain in Britain indefinitely, but hoped he would be able to his homeland one day. &quot;My wife and I have travelled to reside in England,&quot; he said in the statement. &quot;If I still have luck, I would come back to die on Thai soil like every other Thai person.&quot; Five months after returning from exile to a hero&apos;s welcome, he railed that the Thai judicial system was stacked against him, despite his allies in the People Power party winning December&apos;s election. &quot;What happened to my family is like fruit from a poisonous tree - the fruit will also be poisoned,&quot; he said. &quot;There is a continuation of dictatorship managing Thai politics ... which is followed by interference in the justice system.

In what would be an unprecedented case the Premier League would take legal advice before making a decision that could result in Thaksin having to sell his stake in Manchester City. Whether the league would recognise a conviction in Thailand should Thaksin receive political asylum has yet to be determined. The league could yet be spared that difficulty if Thaksin elects to sell the club, although a City spokesman yesterday said the businessman has no such plans.

Thaksin lived in exile in Britain for two years after he was ousted in a 2006 military coup. He returned to Thailand this year to face corruption charges against him after his political allies won new elections and formed a coalition government.  But just five months after returning to a hero&apos;s welcome, Thaksin railed against the Thai judicial system that he said was stacked against him, despite his allies in the People Power party winning the election in December. The swift action against the pair yesterday suggested that almost \u00a31bn of Thaksin&apos;s assets frozen in Thai bank accounts could be at risk, though he is believed to have significant funds salted away in banks outside the country. Chris Baker, Thaksin&apos;s biographer and a political analyst, said of the statement: &quot;Clearly Thaksin is very angry by the way things have turned out. He is obviously extremely emotional. There&apos;s a fighting tone; he&apos;s not given up completely.&quot; But after Pojaman&apos;s conviction Baker said the writing was on the wall for the former leader. He said Thaksin did not want to take any chances with the verdict of a corruption case about an allegedly dubious land deal, due in September, because the verdict, for which there would be no appeal, would be decided by the supreme court. The arrival in London of the telecoms tycoon could present the British government with a diplomatic dilemma. Thailand has had an extradition agreement with the UK since a 1911 bilateral treaty.  The Thai authorities could apply to have their former prime minister extradited, although it would be a lengthy procedure and one which Thaksin would resist on the grounds that the judiciary were allegedly leading a witch-hunt against him.  The legal proceedings also raised questions about the tycoon&apos;s ownership of Manchester City football club and what effect his departure may have on his financing of it.  Thaksin bought Manchester City for \u00a381.6m during his 17-month exile in the UK. It is thought that the Premier League must now ascertain whether he remains a &quot;fit and proper person&quot; to run the club.  Fans have also questioned whether the tycoon&apos;s latest move and the freezing of his assets could put in jeopardy the funds he had hoped to make available for the purchase of new players.  The club, which kicks off its premiership season this weekend, declined to comment on Thaksin&apos;s status yesterday. Backstory Thaksin Shinawatra, 59, a former policeman from Chiang Mai who made a fortune in telecoms, was the first Thai prime minister to win two terms of office. He went into politics in 1994, becoming foreign minister, and then founded the Thai Rak Thai party in 1998.

Skipping bail and fleeing to Britain, the former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra poses fresh problems for the image of British football. If he is convicted as charged by the supreme court in Bangkok on a corruption case about an allegedly dubious land deal, to what extent does Frank Sinatra, as he is known by fans, remain a &quot;fit and proper&quot; person to own Manchester City football club? Mr Scudamore will not have to wait long. The court is due to decide in September. Thailand has an extradition agreement with the UK dating back to 1911. Its government is elected - indeed it was the formation of a coalition government composed of the former prime minister&apos;s allies in the People Power party that persuaded him five months ago to return home and face justice. Jumping bail was not unexpected. His wife Pojaman had just been sentenced to three years in jail for evading millions of pounds in taxes in connection with a share transfer deal in 1997. Pojaman was sentenced along with her stepbrother and former secretary. The tycoon&apos;s son and two daughters also face corruption charges. Thaksin has given two reasons for his sudden return. The couple said they had faced death threats, and claimed their political enemies continued to interfere in Thailand&apos;s justice system. As a result, they said, the court paid scant attention to the rule of law, facts or due process. This may be. British magistrates have shown themselves to be more than willing to reject extradition pleas on the grounds that criminal charges were politically motivated. But if the supreme court finds Thaksin himself guilty, a verdict for which there would be no appeal, the Premier League also faces a legal test. Attached to the Premier League&apos;s regulations for the fit and proper test is a whole appendix of disqualifications, including convictions for conspiracy to defraud, obtaining by deception, theft and fraudulent evasion of duty. Reading it, you would be convinced that the owners and directors of football clubs are squeaky clean. The question is whether this is just a pro-forma blessing, a way of concealing bad smells with an incense burner from the high church of football, or whether the fit and proper test is one that is applied at all. If football clubs are to be more than just the plaything of the highest bidder, and an easy way of acquiring international respectability, British courts should pay attention to what happens in Bangkok.", "publicationDate": "2008-08-12T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Manchester City", "Football", "Sport", "Premier League", "UK news", "Thailand", "World news", "Premier League 2008-09", "Manchester", "Asia Pacific", "Greater Manchester"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/13/manchestercity.internationalcrime", "title": "Editorial: The former Thai prime minister and Manchester City owner poses problems for British football's image", "sentences": ["If he is convicted as charged by the supreme court in Bangkok on a corruption case about an allegedly dubious land deal, to what extent does Frank Sinatra, as he is known by fans, remain a &quot;fit and proper&quot; person to own Manchester City football club?", "If football clubs are to be more than just the plaything of the highest bidder, and an easy way of acquiring international respectability, British courts should pay attention to what happens in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Kristian Digby, presenter of BBC1&apos;s To Buy or Not to Buy University of Westminster Film, video and photographic arts (1995-98)Degree: 2:1 My first year was quite an experience. Being meek and from the West Country, suddenly living in a house-share in London with 15 other students was a shock.  Our house was the most unhygienic property I have ever been in. For some reason, we were obsessed with filling the house with &quot;objets de street art&quot;. I remember coming down one day and finding a whole bus shelter (later joined by a bus stop).  I was a bit geeky and hadn&apos;t caught on to not washing or ironing clothes. I would press my slacks before lectures. But we had a real rat problem, and the landlord brought in Rentokil. I will never forget going to pull out my iron from the kitchen cupboard and realising a rat had rotted over the iron cord. It put me off ironing for a long, long time.  I really enjoyed my course, but for me the really great thing about uni was learning to be in London, how to be an adult, to cook, to go out socialising - and I also discovered my sexuality. Top tip My sister gave me a Student Emergency Kit - full of things like vitamins and a \u00a320 note in an envelope that said &quot;Do not open except in emergency&quot; - and it really did save my life on a number of occasions.

But when I was doing my A-levels, I had a panic when I realised that the alternative was to get a job.  I moved from Maidstone in Kent. From the minute I got to London, it was about clubbing and going out. My fondest memory from that whole period - this is so gay - is meeting Naomi Campbell in a nightclub.  In the last semester, I realised that I was going to get a third and I was mortified. I knuckled down, and once I started going to lectures I started to really enjoy it. So my regret is that I didn&apos;t work harder.  Top tip You&apos;ll never get some opportunities again because you&apos;ll be at work. So if you want to go out clubbing every night, go for it - but make sure you make the most of the people you meet.  Judge Jules, Radio 1 DJ London School of EconomicsLaw (1986-88)Degree: 2:1 I was from London and went to university there, so in my first year all my mates who hadn&apos;t gone on gap years were still around and that gave me a real advantage. I didn&apos;t feel the pressure to meet people straight away.  I did get very involved in running the clubbing side of the student union. I was very keen on the DJ side of things, not least because it got me free records.  The most significant thing was moving away from home. In my case it was very emotional because my mother died a month after I went to university - I had just left home for the first time.  I never actually practised law, but some aspects of my degree have proven invaluable in running a small business. But I was putting on illegal raves throughout university.

The university is very keen that people don&apos;t slip through the net and become lonely, so every minute is accounted for, but the idea that they would provide a structure for us to get to know each other really didn&apos;t appeal. And sportsmen spend so much of their time in enforced sociability that I didn&apos;t need more of it. I was lucky because I was at a small college and there just weren&apos;t enough sportsmen to create a clique. I ended up with friends from all over the place. I&apos;m still in touch with my closest friends from Peterhouse, Rob Ashforth and Jonathan Shapiro. In the first year, the three of us lived in a late regency terrace, St Peter&apos;s Terrace - I had a bedroom on the top floor and a sitting room downstairs, and I installed a phone, which in those days was very exotic.  I enjoyed Cambridge life and the people who taught me history - notably Tim Blanning, Brendan Simms and John Adamson. John was a great don to know because his gift was to make academic life unintimidating and encourage irreverence.

I was quite fearful of going away from home - we were quite a connected family and I spent the first week or so very puffy-eyed.  I lived in an all-girls&apos; hall because I had been at an all-girls school and the idea of being near boys filled me with terror. It was very nice, everyone ate together and watched EastEnders and Blackadder - and it meant that I didn&apos;t have to look at any boys. I did actually have a long-term boyfriend, but I still didn&apos;t know how to actually talk to boys. There were so many clubs and societies you could join. It was a bit like being in a candy shop - I did trampolining for a bit.  The course at Birmingham was, and is, great - it&apos;s the most practical academic course you can do, so we did lighting, stage management and a lot of performance in the second and third year.  Although I found freshers&apos; week difficult, it has stood me in good stead because it is exactly like any first week on set.  Top tip Smile. Make eye-contact.

Some people had amazingly beautiful rooms looking out on to a sunken garden, with an ensuite - but I was in an attic with paper-thin walls and a sink in the cupboard.  I found it hard to get up in the morning, hard not to put on weight from drinking, hard not to leave things to the last minute. There were lots of things that were really good about being at Oxford. I lived next to a park and the river. The libraries were amazing - you could order up these 17th-century popular magazines and they would just turn up in a box for you.

I thought it would be a fun place, and it was. But in the first week it rained so heavily, I thought I&apos;d made a terrible mistake and had a bit of a cry. I hung out with a lot of people from my course, and because I was an indie kid, that&apos;s who I gravitated towards. We found all the indie hangouts and I also got into the Manchester comedy scene, going to see Steve Coogan and Caroline Ahern.  I also acquired my taste for strong liquor. One of the first nights, I drank more Bailey&apos;s than a human being should ever consume, though really no one should drink more than one glass.

Welcome to Thailand&apos;s raucous yet surprisingly sweet, West-meets-East sex industry, which often breaks hearts on both sides. &apos;Fall in lust, don&apos;t fall in love&apos; is a frequent warning. Pretending to be the idealised girlfriend - all coos and kisses, giggles and gaga-eyes - a Thai bar girl allows a man to believe he is a dazzlingly debonair, undiscovered celebrity. &apos;Where else can an old man go to bed with a beautiful 20-year-old girl?&apos; one elderly Brit asked me with a gleam in his wrinkled eyes. &apos;Do they love it? Why not?&apos; he laughed. &apos;I pay them enough.&apos; The Thai bar girls we interviewed said British men are usually the most polite. Instead of haggling about prices and positions - which some foreigners do - Brits may instead ask if they would simply like to spend the evening together. While most tourists go home with the memory of an adventure or mishap from their Thailand trysts, a small minority of foreign men do fall in love, sometimes for all the wrong reasons, including a delusional desire to &apos;rescue&apos; a girl, even though the man soon becomes the one in need of a life-saver.  Worst-case scenarios include men who admit they poured much of their savings into buying a house for their beloved, only to find that she was secretly married to a Thai who helped her secure the land ownership documents, abandoning the foreigner to contemplate shame or suicide. Best-case romances allow women to escape the grimy bars and grim HIV statistics, and develop their potential as a wife, mother or worker. Each coupling offers a unique story, with some women saying they believe in their foreign boyfriends, and innocently marrying into what may or may not be a happy-ever-after life in Britain or elsewhere.  Other girls have become so jaded that when a hopeful admirer offers to buy them a drink, they will add his details to their database and then squeeze out as much as they can, while whispering whatever he wants to hear. \u00b7 Richard S Ehrlich is the Bangkok-based co-author and co-photographer, along with Dave Walker, of a book of investigative journalism entitled &apos;Hello My Big Big Honey!

What did he expect?&apos; Sitting on the ground floor of his home - a two-storey house squatting in a rice paddy in Isan, north-east Thailand - Herrington, aged 51, was talking about his friend and neighbour, Ian Beeston, who was found murdered last weekend after predicting that his Thai wife would kill him. Beeston, 69, a retired design engineer, had been beaten and stabbed in his house - police say he took seven hours to die. His wife, Wacheerawan, 42, and her Thai lover, Somchit Janong, 48, confessed and have been charged with murder. In bizarre and macabre fashion, Janong even re-enacted for police and photographers the manner in which he had clubbed Beeston to death. This was no isolated romance that culminated in a tragedy. The British embassy in Bangkok processes the wedding documents of up to 70 couples each week. The requests are almost exclusively from older British men - among 860,000 UK tourists each year - hoping to marry younger Thai women. But for any British man hoping to follow in Beeston&apos;s footsteps and build a new better life in Thailand, his death was a stark reminder of how badly things can go wrong.  Three of the group of worried farangs - the Thai term for foreigners - who had gathered in Isan, have invested a hefty chunk of their life&apos;s savings building houses nearby on the fringes of Suwannaphum village, deep in Thailand&apos;s poorest province, Roi Et. Beeston&apos;s house, which swallowed up all of his \u00a3250,000 retirement nest egg, was described locally as &apos;palatial&apos;. Unsurprisingly, in the wake of the killing, a siege mentality has taken hold.  &apos;Wanna&apos; was indeed a bar girl, a prostitute. She met Beeston in a bar in Beach Road, Soi 2, in Pattaya, the garish beach resort in southern Thailand, when he was still coming to the country on holiday. The resort is notorious for go-go and hostess bars with a &apos;sin city&apos; reputation that surpasses that of Bangkok. Eventually, his marriage having fallen apart, Beeston took early retirement from his job at the Ford motor plant in Dagenham, Essex, and moved to Thailand. In 1999 he married Wanna and paid for her two grown-up children to be put through university. The good life hit the buffers when he discovered Wanna had secretly sold his Suwannaphum property. As foreigners are barred from owning land in Thailand, he had put everything in her name. All his savings from working as a design engineer, first at Perkins and then at Ford, had gone. Worse, the new owners of his house were agitating to move in. Four months ago a furious Beeston banished Wanna to a corrugated shack in the back garden. Friends feared then that he had signed his own death warrant. In a letter left with lawyers, Beeston predicted his own grisly fate. &apos;It is just a matter of time now,&apos; he wrote. &apos;I am in real fear for my own life.&apos; Beeston&apos;s romance, like so many others involving Western men escaping loneliness at home, began with a stroll down one of the hundreds of neon-lit strips in Thailand&apos;s tourist-friendly sex quarters. The ratio of male tourists to Thai women is almost two to one. Walk down Bangkok&apos;s Soi Cowboy or Patpong any evening and it is easy to see how masculine fantasy can take flight. Ageing, unprepossessing foreign men are fawned over by lithe young Thai women wearing broad smiles and revealing clothes. The prospective clients are beckoned through curtained doorways to a dimly lit world where bar girls dance suggestively on a tiny stage and strip. Others chat up the punters in rudimentary English. The price of all this attention is just the cost of a drink for the girl, perhaps a tip. The often unspoken element is that the girl will go back and spend the night at his hotel. Cash is rarely mentioned, and there is no unseemly haggling, but the going rate is little more than a &apos;present&apos; of \u00a320. &apos;[The men] are often not the most handsome of all, they are usually in the latter years of their life, they are bald, unattractive and quite lonely in their own little society,&apos; writes Thai anthropologist Dr Yos Santasombat in Hello My Big Big Honey!, an anthology of love letters penned to Bangkok bar girls. &apos;When they come to Patpong, they&apos;re struck with girls who are all over them.&apos; The appeal of easy, cheap sex is evident the next morning. The same men hold hands with their bar girls skipping down the pavements of Bangkok&apos;s tourist haunts. &apos;Often they extend their relationship for a number of days or weeks or even years,&apos; writes Yos. &apos;Sometimes the farang himself ends up spending the entire vacation with one girl and sometimes comes back. Sometimes she becomes his mistress or even a wife.&apos; Romance with a Westerner in such circumstances can come perilously close to a game of mutual exploitation. Nearly all of the girls have flocked to the cities and resorts to escape their own prison: an impoverished existence in Thailand&apos;s rural expanses, whereas a night&apos;s takings from the city bar could sustain a family for a month. From Isan&apos;s desperately poor, rice farming villages, where hunger is the norm, the bars of Bangkok or Pattaya are a welcome escape. For girls with little education they provide an opportunity to shine and have the honour of providing for their families by sending new-found riches back home. &apos;They do it because it&apos;s an easy life,&apos; said John Burdett, a British lawyer-turned-novelist who has interviewed hundreds of bar girls for books such as Bangkok Haunts. &apos;You don&apos;t want to be a subsistence rice farmer. It&apos;s very, very hard. Village life&apos;s claustrophobic. Bar girl work isn&apos;t dirty. It&apos;s not strenuous. They don&apos;t have dozens of partners; maybe one or two a week. The rest of the time they&apos;re getting men to buy drinks and existing on tips. In the village there&apos;s a kind of omert\u00e0, where no one talks about it. But they send money home to care for people, so they&apos;ve big status. &apos;A bar girl in her early or mid-twenties has a 10-year window of opportunity to get out of poverty,&apos; said Burdett. &apos;So if she spends time with a guy she is using up her chances. She sees that as an investment and she&apos;s entitled to something in return. The car and the house may be in her name. In the West we&apos;ve lost our intuitive understanding of how poverty shapes thinking. So, if after 10 years together the foreigner decides to move out, leaving her with little to show for it, that&apos;s a problem. She&apos;s lost face and that&apos;s terribly important. Her image has been damaged and it might even lead people to kill.&apos; Stephen Treharne Jones, 63, was a former neighbour of Beeston. Jones met Lamyai, then 32, in a Pattaya bar and sought to &apos;rescue&apos; her and send her home to Isan. &apos;When I met my wife, Lamyai , she had nothing,&apos; said Jones. &apos;I paid her out of a sex bar in Pattaya and told her to go home. When I visited her home she was living in a room with her two children. There was no bathroom or toilet facilities, no doors, no tiles, no electricity, just a mattress and blankets on the floor. So I bought a big home for both of us and bought the land off her relatives.&apos; Jones&apos;s world collapsed when he asked his wife to sell a piece of land he had bought. Lamyai refused, saying it was impossible. Only when he went with a lawyer to the land registry did he discover he never owned it. He bought it from Lamyai&apos;s family, but allowed them to keep it in their names because of foreign ownership prohibitions. When challenged, Lamyai threw him out of their luxury villa in Kalasin, an hour from Suwannaphum. Penniless, he scuttled back to King&apos;s Lynn, Norfolk, two months ago. He now lives there in sheltered accommodation. &apos;Looking back now, I know my Thai wife had set me up from day one,&apos; said Jones last week. &apos;In Kalasin I know of three other foreigners who were kicked out by their wives after they completed property purchases. They say there&apos;s no fool like an old fool. But I did genuinely love Lamyai. I was sold a dream, I guess. A quiet life in the country where food and drink was cheap, the women attentive and the weather warm. But that&apos;s not the reality. The reality is that one becomes a captive.&apos;  Lamyai has a very different account of the breakdown in relations. &apos;If Stephen had been a good husband I would not have asked him to leave,&apos; she said. &apos;But when he argued he called me a thief and a prostitute. We were quite happy for four years, even though he spent a lot of time going out drinking with his farang friends in the area. Stephen had a house he could have lived in all his life if he respected me as his wife, but at the end I was just his servant.&apos; As his own marriage became a bitter property dispute, Beeston saw trouble coming. Exiled to the garden shed, his wife had installed her lover, Janong, and they kept Beeston a virtual prisoner in his own home with taunts and attacks. In a letter to his lawyers, Beeston told how his wife had started a money lending business - lending his money - and had paid off local police so she could run an illegal lottery. &apos;My wife threatened me with a gun,&apos; he said in the letter, detailing a series of attacks on his house involving &apos;stones, lumps of wood, fireworks and even a tin of paint&apos;. The house was also frequently burgled, he said. Like so many Britons and other expatriates living in rural Thailand who are unable to converse in Thai, it appears Beeston may have been the unwitting victim of a sting his wife had been waiting for years to bring off. According to his friends, the whole town, even the police chief, knew but nobody said anything. &apos;I thought she loved me, but she only wanted my money after all,&apos; Beeston had told his Australian neighbour, Bill Lamb.  &apos;He told me he thought his wife was about to kill him,&apos; said Lamb. &apos;My feeling is that Ian had been paying for Wanna&apos;s daughters from a previous marriage to go to university. This year they both graduated. I just don&apos;t think he was needed any more. She had it all. To be honest - the life of a foreigner isn&apos;t worth much around here.&apos; Back in Herrington&apos;s Suwannaphum house, fists were clenched as the group discussed a fitting revenge for the perpetrators of the callous act. The palpable sentiment was: &apos;It&apos;s them or us.&apos; But the bitter consensus was also that after all the publicity had died down Beeston&apos;s wife would be granted bail and freed. &apos;She&apos;s got the money, and with money cases just get dropped,&apos; said Herrington. Then the conversation turned to the future and who was &apos;next for the bullet&apos;. They agree they know the identity of the marked man. He lives about 20 miles away and is having some major problems with his Thai wife. &apos;Yep,&apos; they chorus, &apos;for sure.&apos;", "publicationDate": "2008-08-16T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Women", "World news", "Life and style", "Relationships", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/17/thailand.familyandrelationships", "title": "Bar girl and the expat: a Thailand killing foretold", "sentences": ["The British embassy in Bangkok processes the wedding documents of up to 70 couples each week.", "The resort is notorious for go-go and hostess bars with a &apos;sin city&apos; reputation that surpasses that of Bangkok.", "Walk down Bangkok&apos;s Soi Cowboy or Patpong any evening and it is easy to see how masculine fantasy can take flight.", "&apos;[The men] are often not the most handsome of all, they are usually in the latter years of their life, they are bald, unattractive and quite lonely in their own little society,&apos; writes Thai anthropologist Dr Yos Santasombat in Hello My Big Big Honey!, an anthology of love letters penned to Bangkok bar girls.", "The same men hold hands with their bar girls skipping down the pavements of Bangkok&apos;s tourist haunts.", "From Isan&apos;s desperately poor, rice farming villages, where hunger is the norm, the bars of Bangkok or Pattaya are a welcome escape.", "&apos;They do it because it&apos;s an easy life,&apos; said John Burdett, a British lawyer-turned-novelist who has interviewed hundreds of bar girls for books such as Bangkok Haunts."]}, {"article": "The Post-grad Gapper&apos;After my masters, time for something really different&apos; Mushtaq Patas, student, 22, from Leicester The brief: &apos;I&apos;m studying at Nottingham University for an MA which finishes in October, and after working for six months, I&apos;m planning a six-month trip. I really want to go to South America, and am particularly interested in the Galapagos Islands. I would love to spend some time volunteering there. I&apos;d also like to learn Spanish and travel around the region. But I would consider other destinations, such as India and Sri Lanka.&apos; Budget: At least \u00a34,000 The solution: Lonely Planet&apos;s Abigail Hole: &apos;There are lots of volunteer projects available on the Galapagos Islands. Mushtaq could try the Darwin Foundation (darwinfoundation.org), though it requires a minimum commitment of six months (volunteers pay their own transport, living expenses and insurance). Gap-year providers such as i-to-i.com or gapyearforgrownups.co.uk offer places on various projects, i-to-i has one- to eight-week conservation projects (from \u00a3385 for the first week, \u00a385 a week thereafter, excluding flights).  &apos;He could start in Quito (return airfare \u00a3500-800) and sign up for a language course (doing so on arrival means he can compare schools before committing), often the school can sort out a homestay too. He can then head off to travel around South America. The Gap Year &amp; Round the World branch of Lonely Planet&apos;s Thorntree website (lonelyplanet.com/thorntree) is a good source of ideas.  &apos;Or he could fly to Delhi from London, exploring India overland before flying from Chennai in the south to Sri Lanka. (Flying London-Delhi, then Chennai-Colombo-London will cost around \u00a3750; if he decides to visit only India, London-Delhi costs from \u00a3400 return.) The Confederation of Voluntary Associations (covanetwork.org) could match Mushtaq with a programme that requires his skills.&apos;   Real Gap&apos;s Helen Guyver: &apos;Mushtaq could start by learning Spanish at our school in Quito (from \u00a3449 for two weeks, \u00a3999 for four), then choose between our Galapagos Giant Tortoise Volunteer Project (from \u00a3899 for two weeks or \u00a31,199 for up to four weeks - he can combine this with the language school and get a discount), or teach English to children in the Galapagos (from \u00a3849 for two weeks or \u00a31,099 for four weeks). On either project he would be working alongside international volunteers, many of whom would be travelling independently afterwards. Then he could head back to the Ecuador mainland and down through Peru and Bolivia. In Bolivia he could volunteer at the Sucre orphanage (\u00a3799 for two weeks&apos; language school and four weeks&apos; volunteering).&apos;   Year Out Group&apos;s Richard Oliver: &apos;India is a very popular destination for volunteers, Sri Lanka less so, not least because of the security situation. The key to a successful placement is research. Year Out Group&apos;s website lists a huge range of volunteering organisations, and has a planning checklist. Mushtaq should also ask to be put in touch with someone who has recently returned from that placement.  &apos;Changing Worlds offers childcare, medical, journalism and teaching placements in India from \u00a32,665 for three months, including flights, a two-day course in the UK, three-day familiarisation on arrival and basic food and accommodation. Projects Abroad offers placements in India and Sri Lanka in teaching, care, conservation, journalism, business and veterinary medicine starting at \u00a3845 for a month and \u00a31,395 for three months (slightly more for Sri Lanka). The price includes food and accommodation, transport to and from the airport and insurance. Placements can be extended for \u00a3395/\u00a3495 a month.&apos; The Big Spenders&apos;Six months to see the world&apos; Jackie, 60, speech and language therapist, and Warwick Turnball, 61, university social work tutor, from Leeds The brief: &apos;We&apos;re planning a six-month trip from around November 2009. We&apos;re both in good health and young in attitude. We&apos;d like to include south-east Asia. New Zealand is also a must, probably touring in a camper van. We would like to include South America, particularly Machu Picchu in Peru and the Galapagos Islands. But we&apos;re open to suggestions.&apos; Budget: \u00a330,000 The solution: Lonely Planet&apos;s Abigail Hole: &apos;The first step would be to pick up a round-the-world ticket - try Western Air (westernair.co.uk), Round the World Tickets (roundtheworldtickets.com) or Round the World Experts (www.roundtheworldexperts.co.uk). A route might be Manchester-Bangkok-Singapore-Sydney-Auckland-Santiago-Lima-Quito-Manchester (around \u00a32,250). They could do the Bangkok-Singapore section overland or arrange a tour from Bangkok to Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia, with Explore (explore.co.uk). Then they could fly to Singapore, and train, bus or boat it to Malaysia (try the Perentian Islands). After touring in New Zealand, they can fly to Santiago in Chile, then fly or travel overland to Lima and Machu Picchu, then Ecuador for a cruise around the Galapagos Islands (try happygringo.com).&apos; Real Holiday&apos;s Philip Davies: &apos;The oneworld airline alliance, which includes BA and nine other carriers, offeres a &apos;Global Explorer&apos; multi-stop ticket at just over \u00a32,000, allowing up to 10 stopovers. I would suggest they start in South America, hitting New Zealand for Christmas and south-east Asia in the spring when the weather&apos;s perfect. They could start in Quito, Ecuador, with Imaginative Traveller&apos;s (imaginative-traveller.com) 23-day &apos;Galapagos and Inca Explorer&apos; trip (it includes Machu Picchu). We could tailor a 14-day trip in Chile taking in the Atacama Desert, the lakes and Santiago. Next they could fly to Auckland, stopping off on Easter Island and Bora Bora in French Polynesia. In New Zealand we could tailor-make a trip, but a camper van gives flexibility. They could drop the van in Christchurch and fly to Thailand via Sydney. That would leave \u00a39,000 for an independent adventure around Indochina.&apos; Trailfinders&apos; Andrew Appleby: &apos;To make the most of each region, they should book open-jaw flights and travel overland between the main cities. We&apos;d recommend flying into Bangkok, out of Singapore, into Auckland, out of Christchurch and into Santiago and out of Lima. A British Airways &amp; Qantas World Discovery ticket for the basic route costs from \u00a31,549; we can add other flights. Trailfinders offers a range of tours such as a seven-day independent Peruvian tour with GAP Adventures covering Cuzco, the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu, from \u00a3755 per person. Or we can tailor-make an itinerary - with their budget, the sky is the limit. If they tour New Zealand in a camper van, they should be sure to take in the dramatic scenery around Queenstown and Lake Wakatipu on South Island. Vans cost from \u00a340 a day.&apos; A Solo Trip&apos;Getting under the skin of a place&apos; Susan Thompson, 59, NHS business manager, from Chester The brief:  &apos;I&apos;m looking to set myself a new challenge. I&apos;m planning a solo trip next year of between three and six months and am flexible about where to go, although my first call will be Japan as I have family there. I&apos;d prefer to travel slowly in a couple of countries and really get to know them and the culture. I want to do some voluntary work and I&apos;d like the money I spend to benefit local people.&apos; Budget: \u00a36,000 The solution:  Lonely Planet&apos;s Abigail Hole: &apos;Susan should buy a flight to Japan via Bangkok (\u00a3800). On the return leg, she can explore south-east Asia, perhaps heading for Malaysia or Vietnam to volunteer, as these are particularly unthreatening countries. A good place to start research into voluntary work is lonelyplanet.com/volunteer, which advises on how to best benefit local people. I-to-i (i-to-i.com) offers possibilities such as building homes in Vietnam (\u00a3595-1,595/two-12 weeks). For other building projects try Habitat for Humanity (habitatforhumanity.org.uk), which runs building projects (\u00a31,876/two weeks in Cambodia). Or in Pokhara, Nepal, she could help at the Rainbow Orphanage (orphancarenepal.org/volunteer.php - \u00a3350/two months).   Real Holidays&apos; Philip Davies: &apos;Susan could book a return flight with Sri Lankan Airlines from London to Tokyo via Colombo. If she departs in late September and stays for a month she will enjoy the autumn colours, and have time to see her family and travel. She can then use the Tokyo-Colombo leg of her ticket to connect to Cochin in southern India and join a 29-day North and South India Trip with Intrepid Travel (intrepidtravel.com). Susan could jump ship at the end of the southern section at Masinagudi, close to the Jungle Retreat in the Nigiri Hills for wildlife experiences - where dormitory accommodation costs less than \u00a310 a day. Then she could fly from Bangalore to Delhi to pick up the northern half of Intrepid&apos;s trip, with its Moghul and Rajput highlights. It ends in Delhi so she could fly south to Colombo in January and start six weeks of volunteer work organised by i-to-i (details as before). With international flights at \u00a3810, internal flights at \u00a3400, Intrepid&apos;s tour at \u00a3890, a week at the Jungle Retreat from \u00a350 and a six-week children&apos;s home volunteering placement coming in at \u00a3695, Susan will still have half her budget left for travelling in Japan.&apos;  Gap Year for Grown Ups&apos; Helen Guyver: &apos;She could fly from London to Tokyo, then to Auckland, on to Adelaide, overland to Perth, then back via Bangkok and Delhi for around \u00a32,200. After two weeks in Japan she could join our &apos;Grand Island Explorer&apos;, a 21-day adventure tour of New Zealand which costs \u00a31,499, followed by the &apos;Ultimate Road Journey&apos; in Australia, taking nine days to explore the southern coast, with bush walking, swimming with dolphins and camel trekking. She could then spend four weeks doing community development work in Thailand, teaching English, with a week on a beach too, for \u00a3999, and possibly finish off with four weeks&apos; volunteering in India at the Kanjar Community Development in Rajasthan for \u00a3649. If this is too much she could just choose parts of it and stay longer.&apos; The Green Travellers&apos;We don&apos;t want to fly&apos; Lise Hovesen, 22, and Temujin Doran, 24, art students, from Falmouth, Cornwall  The Brief: &apos;We&apos;re planning a round-the-world trip by land and sea \u2013 we don&apos;t want to fly \u2013 starting in October . We need to start in Berlin and would then like to travelto St Petersburg and on to Moscow for the Trans-Mongolian train to Beijing. We&apos;d like to spend some time in China and about a month in Asia, possibly getting a ferry to Japan. We have heard that some people will take you on as crew on boats \u2013 is this &apos;sea hitch-hiking&apos; viable? We like the idea of a cargo ship across the Pacific from Hong Kong to Canada and would like to spendtime in Canada and America, possibly looking for work to top up our budget. &apos; Budget: \u00a36,000-plus between us The solution: Ed Gillespie: &apos;For the Trans-Siberian and Mongolian railways they need to book well in advance through a Russian agent (G&amp;R International via hostels.ru/en); both get very busy. Ferries to Japan from China go from Tianjin or Shanghai to Kobe and Osaka, take around 48 hours and are good value (try shanghai-ferry. co.jp ). They can get a cargo ship from Japan to Canada (freightertravel.co.nz) but freighters cost \u00a360-80 a day. For security reasons cargo ship &quot;hitchhiking&quot; is not possible these days, but they maybe able to ride free on a yacht (crewseekers.net) . They should not tiethemselves to an itinerary - half the fun lies in plans changing!&apos; Lonely Planet&apos;s Abigail Hole: &apos;They could look for work teaching English in China or Hong Kong (overseasjobcentre.co.uk). Some freighter ships accept paying passengers (http://studenttravel.about.com/od/boardaboat/a/boattravel.htm) but they&apos;re no bargain when a Tokyo-California voyage lasts 13 days. Work permits for Canada or America are tricky; they could try Australia instead, applying for aworking holiday visa (immi.gov.au/visitors/working-holiday) before they go.&apos; Rough Guide&apos;s Doug Lansky: &apos;After the trans-Mongolian to Beijing, they should head to Shanghai or Hong Kong to catch a freighter to Australia (strandtravel.co.uk, freighterworld.com, freighter-cruises.com), or continue to Singapore and pick up a boat there. From Adelaide they can take a container ship to Auckland (six days) and try to hitch a ride on a yacht to Tonga, Fiji, Hawaii or the US from Auckland, Opua or Whangarei. Or they could stay in Australia and look for a ride from Townsville, Airlie Beach or the Whitsundays. In the US, take Greyhound buses (greyhound.com), Amtrak trains (amtrak.com) or do a driveaway (driving someone else&apos;s car ) to cross the country. For driveaway sites try roadtripamerica.com&apos;. The Student Adventurer&apos;I want to climb some seriously high mountains&apos; Sam Hewlings, 18, student, Barnet, London The brief: &apos;I&apos;m taking a gap year prior to university and am currently working to fund it. I am hoping to climb three of the Seven Summits (the highest mountains on each of the seven continents) \u2013 MountElbrus in Europe (5,642m) , Kilimanjaro in Africa (5,895m ) and Aconcagua in South America (6,962m ). I have some climbing/mountaineering experience, but training is something to consider. I&apos;ll be travelling alone, but will most likely join a guided group.&apos; Budget: Around \u00a35,000 (excluding equipment) The solution: KE Adventure Travel&apos;s Pete Royall: &apos;None of these three summits is technically difficult but all require good fitness and stamina, mainly to deal with the effects of high altitude. Of the three, Elbrus is the only one where Sam will definitely need crampons, ice axe and basic mountaineering skills. He could perhaps enrol on a winter skills course before attempting this peak. The budget is not really enough for all three peaks as they are on different continents; I would suggest he concentrate on the highest two and enjoy travelling in Africa and South America . He will have the best chance of success if he joins an organised expedition. This will ensure a good acclimatisation programme and he&apos;ll share the adventure with like-minded people. KE Adventure Travel offers a nine-day ascent of Kilimanjaro for \u00a3795 excluding flights, and park fees will add another \u00a3370. KE&apos;s 22-day Aconcagua ascent costs \u00a31,995 excluding flights, and climbing permits are \u00a3165 in December or January, or \u00a3115 in February. With careful selection of routes and airlines Sam should be able to keep total flight costs under \u00a31,500. The best season to climb Aconcagua is December to February. Kilimanjaro can be climbed pretty much all year round, though it would be sensible to avoid the two wet periods of April/May and November.&apos; Climber magazine&apos;s Kate Burke: &apos;The obvious route for Sam is to join a guided group. Companies such as Jagged Globe run trips to the Seven Summits, providing not only a guide, but also porters, food, permits and even equipment . The full cost of a trip to one of these peaks with a UK organisation could be in the region of \u00a32,000 . See climber.co.uk/marketplace for a list of companies offering expeditions. Finding a guide or group in the nearest town (eg. Moshi for Kilimanjaro) may be cheaper, but he won&apos;t know the credentials of the guide. Kilimanjaro does not require technical ability, but a high level of fitness is essential. Aconcagua is much more challenging: as well as fitness and mental strength, experience with crampon and ice axe is useful, as is experience of moving together roped up. It may be worth going on a winter mountain skills course beforehand. Plas y Brenin in Snowdonia and Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore offer a range of courses. Sam may struggle to find an expedition to Elbrus, as the Foreign Office currently advises against travel to this area [the Caucasus], due to political problems.", "publicationDate": "2008-08-16T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Gap year travel", "Ethical holidays", "Adventure travel", "Budget travel", "Travel", "Green travel", "Ethical and green living", "Backpacking holidays"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/aug/17/gapyeartravel.ethicalholidays", "title": "Need big ideas for your gap-year adventure?", "sentences": ["A route might be Manchester-Bangkok-Singapore-Sydney-Auckland-Santiago-Lima-Quito-Manchester (around \u00a32,250).", "They could do the Bangkok-Singapore section overland or arrange a tour from Bangkok to Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia, with Explore (explore.co.uk).", "We&apos;d recommend flying into Bangkok, out of Singapore, into Auckland, out of Christchurch and into Santiago and out of Lima.", "I want to do some voluntary work and I&apos;d like the money I spend to benefit local people.&apos; Budget: \u00a36,000 The solution:  Lonely Planet&apos;s Abigail Hole: &apos;Susan should buy a flight to Japan via Bangkok (\u00a3800).", "With international flights at \u00a3810, internal flights at \u00a3400, Intrepid&apos;s tour at \u00a3890, a week at the Jungle Retreat from \u00a350 and a six-week children&apos;s home volunteering placement coming in at \u00a3695, Susan will still have half her budget left for travelling in Japan.&apos;  Gap Year for Grown Ups&apos; Helen Guyver: &apos;She could fly from London to Tokyo, then to Auckland, on to Adelaide, overland to Perth, then back via Bangkok and Delhi for around \u00a32,200."]}, {"article": "Gary Glitter was today released from prison in Vietnam after serving most of his three-year sentence for child sex offences. The former glam rock singer, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was driven from Thu Duc prison to Ho Chi Minh City airport, from where he will be deported back to Britain. Vietnamese authorities have forced Glitter to travel economy class after blocking his preferred choice of first or business class. The executive class ban for Glitter, traveling on passport number 761028553 issued to him while he was in prison, came after lawyers attempted to book a ticket back to Britain on Qatar Airways, via Dohar. Qatar Airways refused to take him. He will instead take a Thai airlines flight via Bangkok, where authorities said they would ensure he boarded the second leg of the journey.  Sudarat Sereewat, a member of the Thai National Human Rights Committee, said she would be at the airport when it landed together with Thai immigration police. &quot;We are aware of his passport number and will happily assist Mr Gadd to the intended destination in case he has second thoughts about stopping off here,&quot; she said. Glitter is due to leave Ho Chi Minh City at 8.50pm (2.50pm BST). He is booked on a flight to London Heathrow, arriving at 7.15am tomorrow. He is expected to be met at Heathrow by police and required to sign the register of sex offenders. He will then be subject to monitoring and will have to tell the police where he plans to live and if he plans to go abroad. He could also face an order prohibiting him from going near children or using the internet. Glitter, 64, was jailed in March 2006, after he was convicted of molesting two girls aged 10 and 11 in the southern coastal city of Vung Tau. His sentence was later reduced for good behaviour. His lawyer, Le Thanh Kinh, said Glitter was looking forward to returning to Britain: &quot;He is OK but he is worried about his health. He has problems with his hearing and his heart.&quot; In a recent interview with the Vietnamese newspaper Cong An Nhan Dan (People&apos;s Police), Glitter said he was thinking about resuming his singing career and that he might move to Hong Kong or Singapore. However, last week he said he wanted to come back to the UK to take advantage of the health service. Kinh said Glitter left prison at 11.30am (5.30am BST) and that he was being driven the 90 miles to the airport. Thu Duc is the biggest prison in Vietnam, with more than 10,000 prisoners - including about 100 foreigners. It is in Binh Thuan province, 87 miles north of Ho Chi Minh City. In his 1970s glam rock heyday, Glitter performed in glittery jumpsuits, silver platform shoes and bouffant wigs. He sold 18m records and recorded a string of top 10 hits. His most successful song, the crowd-pleasing anthem Rock and Roll (Part 2) cracked the top 10 in the US, where it continues to bring sports fans to their feet with its rousing one-word chorus: &quot;Hey!&quot; During the 1990s, Glitter&apos;s career faltered, although he appeared on occasional quiz shows and made variety show performances. Glitter&apos;s fall from grace began in 1997, when he took his laptop computer to a repair shop and an employee discovered thousands of hardcore images of children. Two years later, British authorities convicted him of possessing child pornography, and Glitter served half of his four-month jail term. He later went to Cambodia but was expelled in 2002 after children&apos;s rights advocates protested about his presence in the country. Glitter subsequently moved to Vietnam, where he took up residence in a seaside villa in Vung Tau, a resort town popular as a weekend getaway for residents of Ho Chi Minh City. Neighbours said they often heard the bald and burly Glitter singing loudly by his swimming pool and entertaining teenage girls. In November 2005, police launched a week-long manhunt for Glitter after allegations arose that he had been molesting girls at his villa. He was arrested at Ho Chi Minh City airport, where he was trying to board a flight to Bangkok. He was convicted in March last year, when the trial judge denounced him for &quot;disgusting and sick&quot; behaviour. The court said Glitter had molested the girls repeatedly at his villa and in nearby hotels. His sentence was reduced by three months last year for good behaviour during Vietnam&apos;s annual lunar new year prison amnesty.", "publicationDate": "2008-08-19T10:00:00Z", "tags": ["Crime", "Music", "Child protection", "UK news", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/19/ukcrime.childprotection", "title": "Gary Glitter: Thailand on alert to ensure disgraced star completes return to UK", "sentences": ["He will instead take a Thai airlines flight via Bangkok, where authorities said they would ensure he boarded the second leg of the journey.", "He was arrested at Ho Chi Minh City airport, where he was trying to board a flight to Bangkok."]}, {"article": "The Spanish basketball players who made &quot;slitty-eyed&quot; faces for the photographers have reacted with a combination of contrition and hurt feelings; it was simply a gesture of &quot;affection, friendliness and recognition&quot;. And now the torch of affection has been passed to the Argentine women&apos;s football team, who would appear to have been reading from the same joke book. The International Olympic Committee has expressed its displeasure, which has been echoed in much of Europe and North America. But in Asia, home to most of the people who might be seen as targets for this casual racism, the response has been rather more laid back. The thing is, in much of the continent, racial stereotypes tend to be tolerated with little or no comment. Government leaders have over the years made comments that would be unthinkable from their western counterparts: consider the former Japanese prime minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, who suggested that the US population was becoming less intelligent because of increasing numbers of blacks and Hispanics; Singapore&apos;s Lee Kuan Yew and his acceptance of Murray and Herrnstein&apos;s bell curve hypothesis; the Jewish conspiracy rants of former Malaysian leader Mahathir Mohamad. It&apos;s only when western media got hold of these remarks that any sort of condemnation was forthcoming.  The Olympics themselves offered a pretty good representation of the dominant Chinese wisdom about racial diversity: the children carrying the flag at the opening ceremony were not, as was claimed, representatives of every ethnic group in the People&apos;s Republic, but exclusively Han Chinese. This isn&apos;t to suggest that all Asian societies are nests of eugenicists and supremacists; it&apos;s just that words, images and gestures that might be judged as deeply offensive in London and Los Angeles don&apos;t raise many eyebrows in Beijing or Bangkok. What are we seeking to protect when we complain about athletes doing crass, schoolyard Charlie Chan impressions? The Chinese people, who apparently aren&apos;t all that bothered; or our own liberal self-image, with all the notions of equality and fraternity that implies? Let&apos;s be clear: I thought the pictures were deeply unpleasant; and Spanish sport in particular has some pretty murky undercurrents that it needs to address. But isn&apos;t it up to the Chinese people themselves to decide how to respond?

The former glam rock singer, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was driven from Thu Duc prison to Ho Chi Minh City airport and put on a Thai airlines plane to Bangkok.  He is expected to arrive back in Britain at 7.15am tomorrow, where he is likely to be met by police officers at Heathrow airport.  The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said she did not want him to be allowed to leave the country again. &quot;We need to control him, and he will be, once he returns to this country,&quot; Ms Smith told the radio station TalkSport today.  &quot;It certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that he&apos;s got, he shouldn&apos;t be travelling anywhere in the world. I want Gary Glitter to be controlled whilst he&apos;s here and I don&apos;t want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children.&quot; He will be made to sign the register of sex offenders, requiring him to tell the police where is living and notify police if he plans to go abroad. He could also face an order prohibiting him from going near children or using the internet. Vietnamese authorities forced Gadd to travel economy class after blocking his preferred choice of first or business class. The executive class ban for Gadd, travelling on passport number 761028553, issued to him while he was in prison, came after lawyers attempted to book a ticket back to Britain on Qatar Airways, via Doha. Qatar Airways refused to take him. He instead took the Thai flight via Bangkok, where authorities said they would ensure he boarded the second leg of the journey. Sudarat Sereewat, a member of the Thai National Human Rights Committee, said she would be at the airport when it landed together with Thai immigration police. &quot;We are aware of his passport number and will happily assist Mr Gadd to the intended destination in case he has second thoughts about stopping off here,&quot; she said. Gadd, 64, was jailed in March 2006, after he was convicted of molesting two girls aged 10 and 11 in the southern coastal city of Vung Tau. His sentence was later reduced for good behaviour. His lawyer, Le Thanh Kinh, said Gadd was looking forward to returning to Britain: &quot;He is OK but he is worried about his health. He has problems with his hearing and his heart.&quot; In a recent interview with the Vietnamese newspaper Cong An Nhan Dan (People&apos;s Police), Gadd said he was thinking about resuming his singing career and that he might move to Hong Kong or Singapore. However, last week he said he wanted to come back to the UK to take advantage of the health service. Kinh said Gadd left prison at 11.30am (5.30am BST) and that he was driven the 90 miles to the airport. Thu Duc is the biggest prison in Vietnam, with more than 10,000 prisoners - including about 100 foreigners. It is in Binh Thuan province, 87 miles north of Ho Chi Minh City. In his 1970s glam rock heyday, Gadd performed in glittery jumpsuits, silver platform shoes and bouffant wigs. He sold 18m records and recorded a string of top 10 hits. His most successful song, the crowd-pleasing anthem Rock and Roll (Part 2) cracked the top 10 in the US, where it continues to bring sports fans to their feet with its rousing one-word chorus: &quot;Hey!&quot; During the 1990s, his career faltered, although he appeared on occasional quiz shows and made variety show performances. His fall from grace began in 1997, when he took his laptop computer to a repair shop and an employee discovered thousands of hardcore images of children. Two years later, British authorities convicted him of possessing child pornography, and Gadd served half of his four-month jail term. He later went to Cambodia but was expelled in 2002 after children&apos;s rights advocates protested about his presence in the country. Gadd subsequently moved to Vietnam, where he took up residence in a seaside villa in Vung Tau, a resort town popular as a weekend getaway for residents of Ho Chi Minh City. Neighbours said they often heard the bald and burly Gadd singing loudly by his swimming pool and entertaining teenage girls. In November 2005, police launched a week-long manhunt for Gadd after allegations arose that he had been molesting girls at his villa. He was arrested at Ho Chi Minh City airport, where he was trying to board a flight to Bangkok. He was convicted in March last year, when the trial judge denounced him for &quot;disgusting and sick&quot; behaviour. The court said Gadd had molested the girls repeatedly at his villa and in nearby hotels. His sentence was reduced by three months last year for good behaviour during Vietnam&apos;s annual lunar new year prison amnesty.", "publicationDate": "2008-08-19T14:49:07Z", "tags": ["Crime", "Music", "Child protection", "Society", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/19/ukcrime.childprotection1", "title": "Gary Glitter: home secretary Jacqui Smith says disgraced singer should be banned from leaving UK", "sentences": ["The former glam rock singer, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was driven from Thu Duc prison to Ho Chi Minh City airport and put on a Thai airlines plane to Bangkok.", "He instead took the Thai flight via Bangkok, where authorities said they would ensure he boarded the second leg of the journey.", "He was arrested at Ho Chi Minh City airport, where he was trying to board a flight to Bangkok."]}, {"article": "The disgraced glam rock star Gary Glitter last night appeared to have dodged deportation to the UK after refusing to get on a connecting flight from Bangkok and asking Thai officials to allow him to enter Thailand. After a series of confrontations involving flustered British embassy officials, police and Thai immigration officers, Glitter whose real name is Paul Gadd, collapsed in an airport hotel room complaining of a heart ailment.  Glitter had earlier been released from a Vietnamese prison where he had served two-and-a-half years for sexually abusing children, and was expected to arrive at Heathrow shortly after 7am today, having been released from Thu Duc prison, north of Ho Chi Minh City. He was jailed in November 2005 after being convicted of repeated sexual assaults on two girls, aged 10 and 11. His return was thrown into confusion last night, however, when he reportedly collapsed in room 6000 of the Louis Tavern, a hotel sited at the airport but which is in a &quot;no man&apos;s land&quot; between disembarkation and immigration, so not officially in Thailand. In the early hours of this morning he was attended to by a doctor on call at the airport and paid for his treatment in cash. He has demanded to be taken to hospital today. If he is allowed he will have to pass Thai immigration.  Sudarat Sereewat, secretary of Thailand&apos;s Fight Against Child Exploitation group, who was present said: &quot;At first he asked to be allowed to enter Thailand. But he was refused. He said he had not committed any offence here, but he was told he was not wanted here.&quot; Unable to enter Thailand Glitter then demanded to fly on to Singapore but was advised that there was no flight until much later in the morning. He then demanded that he be treated as a first class passenger. &quot;I am not getting back on the plane with all the press there,&quot; he said. &quot;And I&apos;m not going to the first class lounge to be hassled by them. And I&apos;m not going to London. You can&apos;t make me. I have done my time, I am a free man.&quot; After complaining of fatigue and dizziness he was escorted by two Thai immigration policemen to Louis Tavern, a VIP area with small bedrooms in which transit passengers can lie down. Rooms are usually rented by the hour with three hours costing the equivalent of \u00a350. Glitter rented a room for eight hours for \u00a3100.  A British police officer from the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre who had been sent to escort Gadd back to the UK was asked to persuade him to get on the flight, but was unsuccessful. He told Thai officials that Gadd should return to London.  Two Thai Immigration police who were sent to collect him to put him back on the flight to London refused to use force to take him back on the flight. And when the British police officer was asked if he had any paperwork, he admitted he had none except an order to bring Gadd home. He also admitted he had not legal jurisdiction, and he returned to the departure gate to wait.  As Glitter was due to fly home the Home Office announced a series of measures that would make it easier to monitor sex offenders and prevent them committing further crimes in Britain or overseas. They include removing the need for recent evidence when police are seeking to bar offenders from areas frequented by children, for instance, requiring registered offenders to notify police earlier if they want to travel abroad, and allowing the authorities to remove an offender&apos;s passport if he has been banned from travel.  Foreign travel orders, which prevent abusers travelling to specific countries or leaving the UK altogether, will be extended from their current limit of six months.  &quot;I want to see anyone who poses a threat to our children dealt with as firmly as possible,&quot; the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said. &quot;I&apos;ve spoken to child protection experts and the police and they have told me that these changes will further restrict the ability of child sex offenders to harm children both here and overseas.&quot; Glitter, who also served a short sentence in the UK in 1999 for possession of more than 4,000 images of child pornography, had been expected to be met on arrival by Metropolitan police officers, and will be required to sign the sex offenders&apos; register and remain under supervision for the rest of his life.  Under Mappa, the multi-agency public protection arrangements by which sex offenders are monitored, it is understood he will be considered a level 1 risk, requiring the lowest level of monitoring by police and probation officers. This means he must register an address with police and notify them if he moves or stays away for more than a few days. Reports that the former star would go to a hostel in the West Country were unconfirmed. He retains his British passport, however, and, visas permitting, will be free to travel overseas unless a specific order bans him from doing so.", "publicationDate": "2008-08-19T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Child protection", "UK news", "World news", "Society"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/aug/20/childprotection", "title": "Child protection: Glitter evades deportation by refusing to board flight", "sentences": ["The disgraced glam rock star Gary Glitter last night appeared to have dodged deportation to the UK after refusing to get on a connecting flight from Bangkok and asking Thai officials to allow him to enter Thailand."]}, {"article": "The disgraced former glam rocker Gary Glitter could find himself behind bars again after refusing to board a flight to London following his deportation from Vietnam after serving a jail sentence for sexually abusing children.

The mid-range, two-engine, one aisle jet, built by McDonnell Douglas of Long Beach, California, was introduced in 1980. Nearly 1,200 were built until production ceased in 1999, two years after McDonnell Douglas&apos;s merger with Boeing.  MD-80 series aircraft carry up to 172 passengers, depending on seat configuration, and require a minimum crew of two pilots and four cabin staff. Spanair has 36 in its 65-aircraft fleet. The plane that crashed in Madrid today was an MD-82, one of the later variants of the MD-80. Spanair has not suffered a fatal accident since being formed in 1986, although the Aviation Safety Network website lists an incident in May 2001 when the landing gear of an MD-83, which was carrying 57 passengers and crew, failed on touchdown at Liverpool International airport.  AirDisaster.com ranks the MD-80 series as the second safest plane in the skies. It also lists 18 major accidents involving the model since its introduction.  The first was in December 1981, when an Inex-Adria Aviopromet MD-81 crashed into Mont San Pietro, Corsica, while in a holding pattern for landing at Ajaccio.  All 180 passengers and crew were killed, and investigators concluded that the pilots had failed to observe altitude and speed restrictions.  A crash at Milan&apos;s Linate airport in October 2001 killed all 118 people aboard a Scandinavian Airlines MD-87.  Taking off in heavy fog, the plane collided with a Cessna business jet following a misunderstanding between air traffic controllers and the smaller plane.  Both planes broke up and skidded off the runway into a nearby baggage hangar, which partially collapsed.  A China Northern Airlines MD-82 crashed near Dalian in May 2002, killing all 111 people on board.  The Chinese authorities said a fire had been deliberately started on board the aircraft by a terminally ill passenger who had taken out a number of flight insurance policies.  In August 1987, a Northwest Airlines MD-82 crashed shortly after takeoff from Detroit&apos;s Wayne County airport, clipping lampposts and a rooftop before coming to rest upside down on the airport entrance road.  The only survivor was a four-year-old girl.  The cockpit voice recorder showed that the crew had not completed their pre-takeoff checks and the wing flaps were not configured for departure.  An Alaska Airlines MD-83 ditched in the Pacific Ocean shortly before attempting an emergency landing at Los Angeles International airport in January 2000, killing all 88 people aboard.  The crew reported problems with the stabiliser trim, leaving them at 28,000 feet and unable to control the pitch of the aircraft. At the last radio contact, the plane was at 17,000ft and travelling at an unusually slow 119 knots. A park ranger and other pilots flying nearby reported seeing the aircraft plunge into the water. Investigators found poor maintenance had caused crucial parts to become excessively worn.  In August 2005, engine failure caused a West Caribbean Airways MD-82 to crash into mountains near the Colombia-Venezuela border, killing all 160 passengers and crew.  The crew of the passenger flight, from Panama City to Martinique, reported trouble with one engine to Venezuelan air traffic control and diverted to Caracas. Shortly afterwards, they reported that the second engine had gone.  A domestic flight from Bangkok crashed on landing in Phuket, Thailand, in September 2007, killing 88 of the 130 people aboard the One-Two-GO by Orient Thai MD-82.  As the crew attempted a second go-around in adverse weather, the plane was unable to climb, fell back on to the runway and broke up, with the burning wreckage coming to rest in the grass.  Two months later, all 57 passengers and crew died when an Atlasjet Airlines MD-83 on a Turkish domestic flight crashed into mountains near Isparta.  The plane broke into two, and the wings and engine were found on top of a hill with the fuselage 500ft down the slope.  In March and April this year, American Airlines cancelled thousands of flights after a safety audit raised questions over the safety of hydraulic wiring in MD-80s.  No aircraft were grounded, but each inspection took several hours, making cancellations necessary.  American Airlines has the largest number of MD-80s - 300 of its 655-strong fleet. Delta Airlines also cancelled hundreds of flights while inspecting its own fleet of 117 MD-80s.", "publicationDate": "2008-08-20T15:59:05Z", "tags": ["World news", "Madrid air disaster", "Spain", "Travel", "Europe"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/20/madrid.spain1", "title": "MD-80 ranked second safest plane in the skies", "sentences": ["A domestic flight from Bangkok crashed on landing in Phuket, Thailand, in September 2007, killing 88 of the 130 people aboard the One-Two-GO by Orient Thai MD-82."]}, {"article": "Gary Glitter was refused entry to Hong Kong from Thailand last night after Thai officials had earlier failed to persuade the disgraced singer to board a flight to London.

The 64-year-old singer, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was released by Vietnam after serving two years and nine months of a three-year sentence for sexually abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11. He claimed to have had a heart attack in a hotel room in &quot;no man&apos;s land&quot; between disembarkation and immigration at Bangkok airport, but after he was seen by a doctor his demands to be taken to hospital were rejected. He spent some 20 hours in the transit lounge as Thai officials tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to board a flight to London. Colonel Puttipong Musikul, of the Thai immigration police, said Gadd had been in &quot;a great mood, laughing and chatting with our negotiators&quot;, who were trying to persuade him to change his mind. Just before 10pm local time, he finally boarded a flight to Hong Kong.

A Home Office spokeswoman said that the government could not force him to return, and denied claims that he had been able to avoid returning to the UK after the Home Office issued him with a passport in November last year, while he was still in jail. The spokeswoman said Gadd had been issued with a passport in 2002 and the only method by which the government could remove an individual&apos;s passport was through the use of the royal prerogative, which was used &quot;mainly on national security grounds&quot;. If and when he arrives in the UK, he will be met at the airport by police officers and served with an order which effectively will put him on the sex offenders&apos; register. As Gadd was refusing to board the plane to Britain, Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, announced a crackdown on the movements of paedophiles, including increasing from six months to five years the duration of travel orders which prevent convicted paedophiles from travelling abroad. She had earlier told GMTV that Gadd was &quot;despicable&quot;, and said it was &quot;pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again&quot;.  Gadd was convicted of downloading child pornography in the UK in 1999 after a computer repair shop found more than 4,000 images on his laptop. He served two months of a four-month sentence. He then left the country and moved to Spain and Cuba before travelling to south-east Asia. He was expelled from Cambodia in 2002 after the government deemed he posed &quot;a threat to the security of the country&quot;. He was arrested in November 2005 as he tried to board a flight to Thailand from Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. Gadd was investigated on suspicion of rape of minors, but only charged with obscene acts. He pleaded innocent, claiming he was teaching the two girls English, but was convicted and sentenced to three years in jail in March 2006.

He was kicked out of Cambodia after facing allegations of sex crimes and moved to the Vietnamese coastal resort of Vung Tau.  The two girls at first made allegations of rape, which carries a death sentence, but were reportedly paid off with \u00a31,175.  Gadd was arrested trying to leave the country and stood trial, pleading not guilty and claiming he was teaching the girls English. He was convicted and sentenced in March 2006 to three years&apos; jail.  The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said Britain could not enforce Gadd&apos;s return but must have a plan if he did.  On his arrival in the UK, he is to be met at the airport by police officers and served with an order that will effectively put him on the register of known sex offenders. Dr Zoe Hilton, a policy adviser at the NSPCC, said: &quot;This clearly illustrates why it&apos;s so important to have binding agreements between countries which will prevent sex offenders hopping from one place to another and possibly going underground where they will pose a serious threat to children.  &quot;Offenders like Glitter can and should be chaperoned while being deported back to the UK where they can be properly monitored.

He was due to arrive at Heathrow shortly after seven o&apos;clock this morning, to be met by police and served with an order placing him on the sex offenders&apos; register.  The chief of Thailand&apos;s immigration police, Lieutenant General Chatchawal Suksomchit, said Gadd was denied entry because under Thai laws those convicted of child sex abuse in a foreign country could be barred. Another officer, Colonel Worawat Amornwiwat, urged Thai Airways to ensure he went back to England. &quot;There is no choice for him now.&quot;  Gadd was convicted of downloading child pornography in the UK in 1999 after a computer repair shop found thousands of images on his laptop.

The 64-year-old former rock star, whose real name is Paul Francis Gadd, arrived at Heathrow airport just after 7am. Wearing a light blue baseball cap and white T-shirt, Glitter was met by eight uniformed police on leaving the plane. In a brief court hearing at Uxbridge magistrates court, which Gadd did not attend, he was ordered to register as a sex offender within three days. Speaking outside the court, his solicitor, David Corker, said: &quot;Mr Paul Gadd did not come to court because he felt his safety might be in jeopardy. Mr Gadd is not a well man, he appears hard of hearing.&quot;  Corker said his client may have contracted tuberculosis (TB) while serving a prison term in Vietnam.

He said that if Gadd&apos;s conviction had been in the UK and not Vietnam he would have to sign the sex offenders register for life.  Corker told the court that his client&apos;s conviction in Vietnam had been &quot;obtained in appalling circumstances&quot; and was &quot;a travesty of justice&quot;. A district judge, David Simpson, ordered that Gadd sign the sex offenders register for life. Outside court, Corker said Gadd had promised to cooperate with police. &quot;He wanted me to tell you that he did not commit the offences he was convicted of in Vietnam. It was a show trial.&quot; Gadd was previously on the sex offenders register for seven years after being convicted in the UK of downloading child pornography after a computer repair shop found thousands of images on his laptop in 1999.

This week, it&apos;s a triple threat match - Lisa, Sara and Nicole (booo) face the pooblic voooote. Whooo gooooooos? You deciiiiiiiiiiiiiide. Sorry, I lost it there for a moment there didn&apos;t I. I&apos;ll be here, providing a running online commentary or &apos;liveblog&apos; as it&apos;s also known, from 9-10, then I&apos;m back at 10.30 for the evictee interview. Remember to refresh, leave hilarious/abusive comments and drink plenty of water in order to get the most out of tonight&apos;s festivities.  Last week, in an inexplicable turn of events, bufftins hottie and all round nice guy Stuart was voted out ahead of most-irritatingly-nice-person-in-the-world Rachel. For those of you who&apos;ve missed out, imagine a female Ned Flanders, but without the edge. When asked to choose her favourite song and drinks for her party last week her answers were &apos;anything by Britney Spears&apos; and &apos;bottled water&apos;. Seriously. She&apos;s one of those people that&apos;s so unrelentingly chirpy that if you repeatedly slapped her your hand would get sore before she asked you (politely) to stop. If you haven&apos;t already guessed, I&apos;m not a big fan of Rachel. But the general consensus seems to be that Nicole is the real villain in the house at the moment. For some reason verbally abusing a blind person just isn&apos;t acceptable like it used to be. Political correctness gone mad, I say. Essentially, Nicole&apos;s a bit rubbish but rather pretty so I&apos;m willing to forgive her. Is that wrong? It&apos;s been an eventful week all things considered. Taking a lead from Lisa, housemates caked themselves in makeup to make surreal, zombie-like cyphers of themselves, and learnt a dance routine to Michael Jackson&apos;s Thriller (insert your own Darnell Black or White gag). Rex and Nicole argued every day. Mohammed and Rex argued about ciders and fags every other day. Lisa flouted conventional scientific reasoning by suggesting a single wasp sting would kill her. And, my personal highlight, Mo ate one of Mikey&apos;s bogeys in order to earn an extra cider. That&apos;s right, Mo, a 24 year old man, ate one of Mikey&apos;s bogeys. Don&apos;t let anyone tell you Big Brother doesn&apos;t have highbrow cultural significance. So, with the evictee pretty much sewn up tonight, points of interest are as follows: 1. Will Nicole get one of the worst receptions ever? Does she deserve it? 2. What will Nicole and Rex argue about in today&apos;s highlights? Anyone willing to take a bet that they&apos;ll bicker before the first ad-break? 3. Can you imagine ever wanting a cider enough to eat a bogey? Is Mo an alcoholic? Here&apos;s something odd involving Mikey and Darnell&apos;s nipple to keep you going &apos;till I return. Toodle-pip. 21.01 &apos;Time to sharpen your claws. Tonight it&apos;s a good old fashioned cat-fight&apos;. It begins. I&apos;ve been told it&apos;s customary at this point to make some comment about Davina&apos;s clothes. Well, they&apos;re black. It looks a bit like she&apos;s wearing a bin-liner. And her hair looks ... nice. Any more specific than that and I&apos;m in way over my head I&apos;m afraid. I met someone who works on BB and asked them who writes Davina&apos;s so-bad-they&apos;re-supposed-to-be-funny-but-arent-really links. Turns out she writes them herself. Figures. Colonel Mustard? Come again? Anyway, it&apos;s our first chunk of action from the house and Darnell&apos;s comforting Sara about the prospect of eviction by telling her she&apos;ll probably get booed. Why? Because she&apos;s a &apos;newer&apos; housemate. Not, definitely definitely not because he&apos;s secretly in love with her and likes making her upset. 21.07 &apos;Come on pretty&apos; &apos;Don&apos;t touch my hair&apos;. A nice little snapshot of Rex and Nicole there. They&apos;ve argued within an hour of waking up. A new record? What would their composite couple name be when they come out? Nix? Rexole? Rexole sounds a bit like &apos;Rex&apos; and &apos;Arsehole&apos;. Quite apt actually. Rex has to do that chalkboard thing with this week&apos;s shopping budget and receives a shocking announcement from Big Brother - he has to pay to get the luxury bedroom and Nicole&apos;s beloved hair straighteners. Why are they even bothering to try and create conflict between Rex and Nicole? The two of them couldn&apos;t go a day without arguing for all the hair straighteners and ... um ... big white chef hats in the world. 21.14 Rather than annoy his girlfriend Rex chooses to pay for the luxury bedroom and buy loads of cider and special prizes. They must be regretting offering those to the housemates, having to buy 99 individually hilarious gifts must be an absolute nightmare. Conflict! Wow, those BB producers have the housemates dancing like puppets on a string. Turns out, Rex&apos;s decision to take the luxury bedroom upset some people. And they&apos;re arguing! A bit. &apos;It&apos;s a pile of piss decision&apos;, offers Mikey, sagely. 21.20 Mikey tactfully brings up, in front of Nicole, Rex&apos;s sleeping in the same bed as attractive blonde ex-housemate Steph in the first week. Nicole is not happy. I predict pouting and possibly tears. Nicole and Rex discuss matters, and once again meet a mutual agreement to repress all the problems in their relationship so they don&apos;t look silly on national television. They dry hump instead. As an aside, have you noticed how they always say &apos;national&apos; television? As if there&apos;s a regional Big Brother only available in Yorkshire that barely as many people watch? I&apos;d quite like that actually. Sara&apos;s having a chat with Big Brother. Her voice is so unbelievably irritating it&apos;s almost completely put me off going to Australia. No one spoke like that on Neighbours. She&apos;s upset about something or other, Darnell, yada yada yada. I quite hope she goes. But she won&apos;t will she. Perhaps I could put teletext on? 21.26 Ad for some godawful Nicolas Cage film Bangkok Dangerous - &apos;The only way out, is to break all the rules&apos;. Dennis should go and see that. And Alex. Ha. 21.29 Darnell, Mikey and Mo discuss Sara. They all quite fancy her, but haven&apos;t gotten anywhere, so they do the logical thing and slag her off a bit. &apos;She&apos;s only interested in money and fame&apos; suggest the three contestants in the \u00a3100,000 celebrity making game show. 21.33 The prizes arrive. They&apos;ve given up a bit and given them loads of potatoes. I feel cheated. Darnell grabs a burger and enjoys it a little bit too much. It&apos;s quite clearly a Whopper but they&apos;ve put black tape on to hide the logos. Bless. Within a minute of alcohol entering the house, an argument erupts. Since when is cider so great? It&apos;s all those trendy Magners ads, I tell ya. Mo&apos;s fairly pathetic attempt at hiding the ciders fail. &apos;It&apos;s my rotation&apos; he insists. Nicole bursts into tears. She clearly doesn&apos;t think it&apos;s his rotation. It must be tough being Nicole, constantly petted by Rex, so emotionally fragile that she&apos;ll get upset at the slightest thing. Outside, Darnell&apos;s angry and speaking the truth, but with his mouth full, which lessens the impact somewhat. Sara doesn&apos;t understand what he was talking about. Neither do I. 21.46 Why does Mo keep getting angry when he&apos;s called greedy? He&apos;s quite clearly greedy. The cider row is rumbling on. Meanwhile Sara&apos;s crying in the diary room ... I feel bad now. I didn&apos;t mean what I said about her voice, she could definitely be on Neighbours. As one of Stingray&apos;s bogan girlfriends or something. Darnell enters the diary room to give his two cents. He&apos;s quite frustrated ... but not because he loves her. No. Clearly not. She can &apos;kiss [his] ass&apos;. I imagine he&apos;d quite enjoy that to be honest. 21.54 Right, highlights over, its eviction time. Unnecessary dramatic pause.... Nicole! Wow. Oh wait. No, that&apos;s not surprising at all. Nicole gives a fake little yes punch that she almost sells but doesn&apos;t quite. Rex is gutted as he knows he&apos;s not quite as popular as he thought. And that wraps up the first hour. I&apos;m off to find some food - I&apos;ll be back at 10.30 for boos, placard waving and a Paxman like grilling from Davina. 22.34 Hello again. We&apos;re not getting a lot of Nicole love in the comments. Someone must like her? No? Fair enough. I&apos;m going to stick up for her. I like her hair. She&apos;s in touch with her emotions. She seems to be in good health, generally. Apart from the smoking. And she doesn&apos;t seem to have any violent tendencies. Come on guys, she&apos;s no Dennis or Alex, surely. Rexole are spending the last few minutes of their time together arguing. Naturally. It does seem to be Rex&apos;s paranoia that starts most of these. A little sympathy for Nicole in this respect? No? Not at all? I give up. She&apos;s a bellend isn&apos;t she. The crowd .... unanimously agrees. And expresses this sentiment via the medium of booing. 100s of angry villagers shouting &apos;burn the witch&apos; at a scared blonde girl. I could make some point about how far we&apos;ve come in 200 years but Davina&apos;s flapping wardrobe malfunction distracted me. From the comments box: &apos;It looks like an oil slick has vomited over Davina&apos;. Indeed. Do you think she always wears black in real life? She didn&apos;t in Streetmate. 22.42 Or was it Streetdate? I don&apos;t remember. I must admit, I&apos;m a big Davina fan. She brings a lot of energy and facial expressions and stuff. When she&apos;s replaced with Justin Lee Collins we&apos;ll be begging her to come back. Davina&apos;s got her mean face on. Is their much juice she can get out of Nicole really? She&apos;s only been in their three weeks. Nicole seems remarkably composed for someone who&apos;s just got such a negative reception. One negative comment on this blog and I&apos;d be in tears. Seriously. I&apos;m tempting fate aren&apos;t I. What must it be like to watch a highlights package of how rubbish your relationship is? &apos;Cringe&apos; apparently. 22.52 Nicole&apos;s ears are quite strange and pointy. Davina&apos;s tackling the Mikey abuse - serious face again. She&apos;s not giving Nicole an inch. Nicole apologises, though to whom I&apos;m not too sure. The blind community? I thought she came across rather well - especially compared to Steph who, as another 19-year-old girl, seemed like a rabbit in the headlights in her post-eviction interview. 22.58 Well that&apos;s it from me. Thanks all for the comments, it&apos;s been a ball. &apos;Vina&apos;s confirmed the Mario proposal on Sunday, so don&apos;t miss that. I&apos;ll wager it tips firmly in one direction on the scale from romantic to cheesy. But which way? Hmmmm.

Between the crowds of sombrero-wearing, surfboard-wielding travellers, Paul Francis Gadd, better known as Gary Glitter, was nowhere to be seen. But then the 64-year-old convicted paedophile and glam rocker had made different arrangements for his feverishly anticipated arrival back in Britain, or had different arrangements made for him.  When Thai Airways flight TG910 touched down at 7.09am, Gadd was not met by friends or relatives. His welcoming committee comprised eight Metropolitan police officers who escorted him from the plane ahead of the other passengers and whisked him away from a frustrated gaggle of reporters, photographers and television crews. It was an abrupt climax to a bizarre week which has seen Gadd shunted from Thailand to Hong Kong and back to Thailand as he searched for a hiding hole after serving almost three years in a Vietnamese prison for committing obscene acts with two young girls.  By 9am, with the disgraced rocker still nowhere to be seen, the press pack had decamped to the rainswept surroundings of Uxbridge magistrates court, where, rumour had it, he would appear to find out whether he would be put on the sex offenders&apos; register for the rest of his life. Again, Gadd failed to materialise, apparently preferring to stay in an immigration office at Terminal 3.  His lawyer, David Corker, told the court that his client had been wrongly convicted in Vietnam and questioned the conviction&apos;s legality under British law. &quot;This was a conviction obtained in the most appalling of circumstances. My client feels it was an unfair trial and a travesty of justice. We need to inquire whether this conviction should be recognised by this court.&quot;  The Vietnamese justice system was &quot;far, far below what is acceptable in western European standards&quot;. Rajeev Shetty, counsel for the Metropolitan police, said the case was clear. &quot;The fact remains that Mr Gadd was aware what the police were intending to do at least three or four days ago. Mr Gadd&apos;s situation is clear. Mr Gadd has been convicted of a relevant offence and the fact of that conviction cannot possibly be challenged.&quot; District judge David Simpson rejected the request, saying the conviction was not disputed and the conditions for an indefinite notification order had been met. Imposing the order that requires Gadd to sign the sex offenders&apos; register within three days, he added: &quot;Mr Gadd has demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court.&quot;  Under the terms of the order, Gadd will have to tell police where he plans to live and inform them of any travel plans. He will have 21 days to appeal. The cat-and-mouse hunt for Gadd continued into the afternoon, with reports that he had been spotted getting out of a taxi in Tooting, south London. &quot;He didn&apos;t seem to have any bags and was shouting at the taxi driver, asking him where he was,&quot; said Bob Bennett, a local, who added: &quot;He asked me the way to Tooting Broadway. I told him to hop on the number 76 bus. The kids at the bus stop were asking their mums &apos;Is that Gary Glitter?&apos;&quot;  Corker said his client was happy to be back in Britain and insisted that Gadd&apos;s days in international limbo, including the abortive trip to Hong Kong and the 20 hours he spent in the transit lounge of Bangkok airport, had not been wasted. &quot;It enabled Mr Gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival. Mr Gadd is not a well man, he needs medical attention and is also, unsurprisingly, concerned about his safety and these past few days have enabled the Metropolitan police and I, on his behalf, to put into place a proper procedure for his protection and his wellbeing.&quot; The Vietnamese legal system had, he said, subjected Gadd to a &quot;show trial&quot;. He added that Gadd hoped to have an opportunity to test his Vietnamese conviction in a British court. He said his client now had three days to work with the police.  A spokesman for the Metropolitan police declined to comment on the case or on whether police protection was being provided.  Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of the probation union, Napo, said that if reports that Gadd had millions in the bank were correct, any protection was unlikely to come out of the public purse.  He added that Gadd&apos;s case was different to those of Maxine Carr, the ex-girlfriend of the Soham murderer Ian Huntley, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, who killed the Liverpool child James Bulger. &quot;They had their identities changed, but here we have someone in the public eye and in terms of a new identity, you can&apos;t really give him one. I would have thought that the police will conclude that the measures they have to put in place will be minimal.&quot; Some reports yesterday suggested Gadd was considering a move to the West Country. How long he can keep his new location a secret is another question. Unwelcome traveller Tuesday, August 19  After being released from jail Gadd leaves Vietnam for Thailand.

Manchester City will always be the attractive, loveable losers while, down the road, their enemies get all the trophies. City get by on spirit and gallows humour and a general acceptance that things will always go wrong. It is all part of the charm, the endearing qualities that have led their former manager Joe Royle to talk of a disease called &quot;Cityitis&quot;, Sir Alex Ferguson to nickname their stadium the &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; and their supporters to fear they will always be in the shadow of their overbearing neighbours. And then there is Garry Cook, headhunted by Thaksin Shinawatra three months ago to become their executive chairman and clearly a man who wants to look at the stars in the sky rather than the mud in the gutter. A man who believes City can be the biggest club in Manchester. &quot;And we will,&quot; he says. &quot;Can we be as big, or bigger, than Manchester United? Yes. Can we win the Premier League? Yes. Can we win the Champions League? It will take time, probably 10 years or more. But if I didn&apos;t think that, I wouldn&apos;t be here.&quot; It is a staggering prediction at a time when Thaksin has \u00a3800m of assets frozen in Thailand and Mark Hughes&apos;s body language is so downbeat. Yet Cook is deadly serious. &quot;The truth is that this club is not going out of business, it is not bankrupt and we currently have good offers in for four players. I know what&apos;s ahead and I know Thaksin&apos;s ambitions. He still wants to buy the Ronaldinhos of this world and he knows he can do that only if he has an abundant amount of cash.&quot; There is, he admits, a &quot;cash challenge&quot; in the short term. City have taken out a \u00a330m bank loan to help them through, he confirms. &quot;Do we have \u00a340m in the bank to buy new players? No.&quot; Yet Cook is encouraged because Thaksin is talking to some of the world&apos;s richest men about investing in the club. They have had &quot;Dubai, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on the phone&quot; and met &quot;the second richest man in China&quot;. Funding is on its way. &quot;We have five or six different options and we want to get it done in the transfer window because we need three or four players.&quot; The important thing is that Thaksin will continue to bankroll the club. &quot;As he resolves his issues in Thailand, the anticipation is that he will get some of his money back.&quot; Does the one-time billionaire have bank accounts outside Thailand? &quot;I&apos;m going to assume he doesn&apos;t,&quot; says Cook. &quot;All I know is that he has some very wealthy friends.&quot; Thaksin is &quot;embarrassed about the indignities he has brought on the club&quot; and willing to stand down as a director. Yet Cook has misgivings about the Premier League&apos;s fit-and-proper-person test. &quot;It is a very loose term, almost tongue-in-cheek, because there have been plenty of unfit and improper people in the league over the last 10 years.&quot; He talks of a sport rife with &quot;greed and jealousy - I won&apos;t use the word corruption but wherever there&apos;s greed and jealousy there will be something else that follows it&quot;. As for working for a man who has been described by Human Rights Watch as a &quot;human rights abuser of the worst kind&quot;, Cook replies: &quot;He&apos;s embroiled in a political process and I&apos;ve chosen to stay out of it. Is he a nice guy? Yes. Is he a great guy to play golf with? Yes. Does he have plenty of money to run a football club? Yes. I really care only about those three things. Whether he [Thaksin] is guilty of something over in Thailand, I can&apos;t worry. I have to be conscious of it. But my role is to run a football club. I worked for Nike who were accused of child-labour issues and I managed to have a career there for 15 years. I believed we were innocent of most of the issues. Morally, I felt comfortable in that environment. It&apos;s the same here.&quot; Not everyone will be satisfied, but Cook is more bothered about the &quot;10-year plan&quot; to become a &quot;global empire&quot; and bringing in a box-office signing. &quot;We need a superstar,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ve talked about this a lot to Mark and he sort of understands. China and India, 30% of the world population, need a league to watch and we want Manchester City to be their club. To do that, we need a superstar because, no disrespect, Richard Dunne doesn&apos;t roll off the tongue in Beijing.&quot; The obvious question is: shouldn&apos;t it be up to Hughes who they sign? Cook says there would be a &quot;heated debate&quot; if Hughes objected. &quot;When we talked to Mark about coming to this club we said, &apos;Don&apos;t come if you don&apos;t think you need a superstar.&apos; He said he wanted to challenge himself by managing the best players.&quot; Yet Hughes was lukewarm, to say the least, about the drawn-out pursuit of Ronaldinho. As Cook admits, the former Blackburn manager has simpler tastes. &quot;Mark is adamant he wants Premier League experience because that is what let us down last season. Mark&apos;s a homegrown lad, very old school. He&apos;d rather sign players he knows, even overpay. That&apos;s an endearing piece of what he&apos;s all about. He doesn&apos;t like the unknown because it takes him out of his comfort zone. He jumps out of his comfort zone when we say to him, &apos;Hey, you&apos;ve got to change this up a little bit.&apos; But he can&apos;t have Roque Santa Cruz so now he&apos;s back in his &apos;uncomfortable zone&apos;, which is that he will have to bring in someone new and develop them.&quot; Hughes, he says, was unfortunate because Sven-Goran Eriksson&apos;s recruiting from abroad meant City had &quot;players who weren&apos;t right for the club&quot; - especially in &quot;the dead of winter when the players are putting on gloves and tights, there are five games in 10 days and it&apos;s bloody tough&quot;. Hughes was said to be against City&apos;s plans to sell Vedran Corluka and Stephen Ireland. Cook&apos;s take is very different. &quot;Mark&apos;s assessment was that he had seen the players he wanted to keep and the areas where he felt we could do better. There were a couple of players we looked at [selling] because Mark said he wanted to bring in better. We went out to sign those players, they didn&apos;t come and we were left holding the baby.&quot;  It hardly represents a vote of confidence for Corluka and Ireland, but Cook is unapologetic. &quot;Everyone&apos;s for sale. If they want to stay at this club they will have to aspire to it.&quot; The better news for Hughes is that Thaksin will not, according to Cook, automatically sack him if City fail to reach the last six. &quot;Thaksin has said himself, &apos;I probably made some mistakes last season.&apos; He realises he needs to give the manager more room, be more patient.&quot; Thaksin, however, has not had a complete change of personality. As Cook says: &quot;If I were to ask him, &apos;Is it true we haven&apos;t got any money?&apos; he&apos;d fire me on the spot.&quot; In pursuit of a global brand By his own admission, Garry Cook has radical views on football that not everyone will agree with, not least his belief that there should be a new top division of 10-14 elite clubs with no promotion or relegation. &apos;The fans,&apos; he says, &apos;would find a way to get passionate about it.&apos; A Birmingham City fan, with a part-West Midlands and part-American accent, Cook previously worked in an executive role for Nike in Portland, Oregon, becoming president of the Nike Jordan Brand. The Premier League is &apos;10 years behind&apos; the US in merchandising. &apos;This is the most powerful sports league in the world but also the most undervalued.&apos; Manchester United had not &apos;even scratched the surface and if anyone&apos;s got a headstart it&apos;s them&apos;. As for City, he says their behind-the-scenes operation is a &apos;shock to me&apos; explaining: &apos;You look at our brand and it&apos;s Thomas Cook. There&apos;s something not quite right about watching us in a bar in Beijing or Bangkok or Tokyo and seeing &quot;Fred Smith&apos;s Plumbing, call 0161 ...&quot;&apos; He was angry when a side of ex-players won the Masters tournament &apos;using our name and our badge when they had nothing to do with us - then, lo and behold, we congratulate them in the programme.

Mark Hughes will certainly be grateful to have come up against such obliging opponents as this rudderless West Ham side on the day Manchester City banished a few more of their early-season problems and Thaksin Shinawatra decided it was safe to show his face again. City&apos;s owner had been warned to keep away for his own safety but changed his mind after a security meeting and, as well as his usual phalanx of bodyguards, the former prime minister of Thailand brought with him a block booking of supporters from Bangkok. Naturally, this group was in a strategic position to be seen by the television cameras and, after every goal, a banner was lifted proclaiming: &quot;We support Thaksin.&quot;  It will not sit easily with every City supporter but, politics aside, Thaksin chose a good day to return. Ignoring, for one moment, West Ham&apos;s wretchedness, this was exactly the football he had promised to deliver - slick and entertaining - with two goals from Elano and a left-foot strike that demonstrates why the 18-year-old Daniel Sturridge is rated so highly.  The one downside for City was the sight of Micah Richards lying unconscious on a stretcher, wearing a neck brace and an oxygen mask, after a clash of heads with his team-mate Tal Ben Haim. Yet the overall feeling was one of intense satisfaction, Hughes describing the performance as &quot;excellent&quot; after three goals in an 11-minute spell of a game that saw Mark Noble become the first Premier League player to be sent off this season and an incensed Alan Curbishley questioning his entire team.  &quot;I can&apos;t look at any of them and say they can hold up their hands and say they performed,&quot; said the West Ham manager. Noble had been booked in the 34th minute after stumbling over the ball and then grabbing out at it to prevent Vincent Kompany, City&apos;s accomplished debutant, taking possession. Three minutes later, the midfielder lunged in at Michael Johnson and connected with the player&apos;s instep. Curbishley thought it was harsh at first, but withdrew his complaint after watching the video replay. The red card gave City all the encouragement they needed although Curbishley was looking agitated even before then. His team began sluggishly and got worse from there. Their passing was poor, their movement one-paced and, after somehow holding out for the first 65 minutes, they collapsed after Sturridge latched on to Matthew Upson&apos;s poor clearance and lashed a shot into the roof of the net. By then, City had already struck the woodwork twice, first when Callum Davenport got a decisive block on Ben Haim&apos;s goalbound shot, then when Martin Petrov curled a free-kick against Robert Green&apos;s left-hand post. Davenport also cleared a Stephen Ireland shot off the goalline as it dawned on City that their opponents were there for the taking. Once the penny had dropped, they never looked back.  If Curbishley had had his spies at City&apos;s previous home game, the 1-0 defeat to FC Midtjylland in the first leg of a Uefa Cup qualifier, he would have seen a team booed off by their supporters and utterly devoid of confidence or imagination. This time, at least half of Hughes&apos;s side were playing at the point of maximum expression.  Petrov, in particular, made it a chastening experience for Valon Behrami, West Ham&apos;s \u00a35m recruit from Lazio. Ireland was superb on his return to the team and, on this form, he and Vedran Corluka are entitled to feel they proved a point after the executive chairman, Garry Cook, stated at the weekend that Hughes was trying to replace them with &quot;better players&quot;. Both of Elano&apos;s right-foot finishes were created on the right, teed up by Ireland after foraging runs by Corluka. &quot;I know it&apos;s early days,&quot; said Curbishley, &quot;but that performance was not good enough.&quot; Man of the Match Martin Petrov (Man City)His direct running and ability to play telling crosses were a problem for West Ham all afternoonBest moment Knocking the ball one side of Valon Behrami, then running the other side to regain possession in a show of speed, skill and determination", "publicationDate": "2008-08-24T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Premier League", "Manchester City", "West Ham United", "Football", "Sport", "Premier League 2008-09"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/25/premierleague.manchestercity", "title": "Football: Thaksin Shinawatra picks a good day to return as City thump toothless Hammers", "sentences": ["City&apos;s owner had been warned to keep away for his own safety but changed his mind after a security meeting and, as well as his usual phalanx of bodyguards, the former prime minister of Thailand brought with him a block booking of supporters from Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Anti-government protesters have stormed the compound of Thailand&apos;s prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, as part of demonstrations across Bangkok today aimed at forcing his resignation.

Leaving aside any moral consideration of the extra-judicial murders alleged against the former Thai prime minister&apos;s regime by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch - which he denies - Thaksin&apos;s takeover was fraught with some very practical difficulties.  He was living in exile in London having been deposed in a military coup in September 2006. That had followed a public outcry in Thailand at reports that the Shinawatra family had paid almost no tax when they sold the family telecommunications business, Shin Corp, for $2.1bn to a Singaporean company, Temasek. The new military government had established a commission, the Assets Examination Committee, specifically to investigate Thaksin and his family, how they had amassed their fortune while he was the country&apos;s prime minister, and to recommend criminal charges if any corruption was suspected.  In June last year, while Thaksin was deep in negotiations to buy City, he was charged by Thai prosecutors with two corruption offences, and his money in Thailand, reported to be \u00a3800m, was frozen. Yet still City&apos;s directors pressed on. On June 26, John Wardle, City&apos;s chairman, wrote to all shareholders - many of them lifelong fans holding a few shares - saying the directors &quot;unanimously recommend&quot; that they should all sell to Thaksin.  Thaksin was described as &quot;a passionate follower of English football,&quot; who had &quot;received accolades for being businessman of the year in Thailand and abroad&quot;. He had promised that after taking City over by buying all the shares for a total \u00a321.6m, and repaying Wardle and his fellow major shareholder David Makin \u00a317.5m of their outstanding loans, Thaksin&apos;s company would &quot;commit further significant sums&quot; to buy players and invest in City&apos;s academy.  Just a paragraph was devoted to the remarkable circumstance that Manchester City was being sold to a man with momentous legal and political troubles hanging over his head. It acknowledged that the Assets Examination Committee had frozen Thaksin&apos;s bank accounts and assets in Thailand &quot;in relation to alleged conflicts of interest, corruption and related offences&quot;. However, all was apparently well, because the allegations were &quot;entirely refuted&quot; and he would be &quot;vigorously defending&quot; them.  Wardle and Makin had agreed to sell their 29.9% of City for \u00a36.45m and all the other directors had committed to selling their shares too. The directors apparently received legal advice that if Thaksin had the money to buy the shares they had to recommend him to shareholders because there was no other formal bid. The former City player Ray Ranson had offered the same price, 40p per share, two months earlier, but his bid was not pursued. As shareholders, the directors could have refused to sell, however, and Wardle is described as having agonised before agreeing to the Thaksin deal. There was no public indication that the human-rights allegations weighed too heavily on anybody&apos;s mind at Eastlands. The corruption charges, the money frozen in Thailand and the potential impact on the club were considered, but they seemed far-away and complicated issues. Thaksin argued, as he still does, that the proceedings were politically motivated, and Wardle was persuaded that once elections were held in Thailand and a democratic government restored, Thaksin would be in the clear.  The single most persuasive factor of all, of course, was that City&apos;s directors believed they had bagged one of the international billionaires then cheerily buying Premier League football clubs. Thaksin had money (even if much of it was frozen), and was promising to buy players for City, so they sold the club to the man despite his combustible baggage, and hoped for the best.  Nobody at City then wanted to talk about Thaksin&apos;s difficulties. Wardle offered no public explanation of his reasoning. The official line was that the corruption charges were being brought under a military government and so had no validity. Within days Sven-Goran Eriksson was the manager, Elano, Martin Petrov and Vedran Corluka were signed, City won their first three games including a 1-0 victory over Manchester United, and the sun shone at Eastlands.  With some exceptions, the fans were oblivious, or unconcerned, about the controversies attached to the new owner. Thousands of them had accepted the invitation to Albert Square for a free Thai buffet, and Thaksin was given the fond nickname Frank (Shinawatra - Sinatra: geddit?). At the time, the top two YouTube clips for Thaksin were of anti-Thaksin demonstrations in Bangkok just before the coup, and the love-in for him in Manchester.  Now, it is clear, the course of that love has not run so smooth for City, Thaksin, Wardle or the supporters. Elections were held in Thailand last December; the PPP, a party sympathetic to Thaksin, was elected, but that did not stop the legal authorities&apos; prosecution of the Shinawatras. Last month Thaksin&apos;s wife, Pojaman, was convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to three years in prison. The verdict in the first case against Thaksin is expected on September 17, but rather than stay and face it, he and Pojaman have fled back to London. Thai prosecutors this week asked the supreme court to seize ownership of the frozen money, arguing it was corruptly earned. He still denies all charges.  Even allowing that Thaksin&apos;s human-rights record, the corruption charges against him and his frozen assets were not considered by City&apos;s directors and major shareholders as barriers to him becoming the club&apos;s new owner, we now know that the wads of his money they hoped for never materialised. Well-placed sources say Thaksin did loan City money to support last summer&apos;s flood of signings - although the headline \u00a347m in transfer fees was not paid, but around \u00a312m in initial payments. City&apos;s wage bill has climbed and further instalments are due on players, but City&apos;s new chairman, Garry Cook, has acknowledged that Thaksin is not funding the club now. Last month City took out a \u00a325m loan facility with Standard Bank, mortgaged on the club&apos;s Premier League TV payments, to cover cash shortfalls. Wardle himself is understood to have loaned the club \u00a32m three times in the last year - not what he expected to be doing when he sold City to Thaksin last June. All of the loans are understood to have been repaid and Cook is clear that City are not in financial difficulties. The Thaksin takeover was allowed according to the Premier League&apos;s rules; its &quot;fit and proper person test&quot; bars only convicted criminals, not people subject to criminal investigations or even prosecution. It was, though, open to Wardle and the other major shareholders not to sell to Thaksin because of all the controversy and uncertainty swirling round him.  If it seems bizarre that Manchester City, the club of Bert Trautmann, Colin Bell and Blue Moon, is owned by a fugitive former Thai prime minister facing corruption charges and seizure of assets, it is more bizarre still that this was all known and quite predictable, when the club&apos;s then owners recommended him and accepted his money, with their eyes wide open. Testing times City&apos;s chairman Garry Cook said last week that Thaksin may step down from the board if he is considered too much of an embarrassment, but still retain his ownership of the club. However the Premier League&apos;s &quot;fit and proper person test&quot;, which bars convicted criminals from being directors, also applies to 30% shareholders. City is owned by a holding company, UK Sports Investment Holdings, in which Thaksin has a small stake, with the majority held by his son and daughter, Panthongtae and Pintongta. There are also 41,667 preference shares held by a Bangkok registered property company owned by Thaksin and his immediate family. The Premier League says it will be guided by the government as to the validity of any conviction if Thaksin is found guilty on September 17. If he is barred under the test from owning 30% of City, the Premier League may then be faced with unpicking the detail of Shinawatra&apos;s ownership, and forcing him to sell his holding.", "publicationDate": "2008-08-26T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Manchester City", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport", "Premier League 2008-09"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/27/manchestercity.premierleague", "title": "Football: Manchester City face up to uncertain future as Thaksin awaits verdict", "sentences": ["At the time, the top two YouTube clips for Thaksin were of anti-Thaksin demonstrations in Bangkok just before the coup, and the love-in for him in Manchester.", "There are also 41,667 preference shares held by a Bangkok registered property company owned by Thaksin and his immediate family."]}, {"article": "     A court in Thailand today issued arrest warrants for nine anti-government protesters whose followers have taken over the prime minister&apos;s office compound. Up to 30,000 supporters of the right-wing People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy are in a standoff with thousands of riot police after occupying Government House yesterday afternoon.  The deputy police spokesman, Major General Suraphol Tuanthong, said those involved faced charges of insurrection, which can carry a sentence of death or life imprisonment.  The nine alleged leaders also face charges of conspiracy to commit insurrection, assembling 10 or more persons to cause a public disturbance, and ignoring a lawful order to disperse.  The protest group&apos;s most high-profile leaders are Chamlong Srimuang, an influential former politician and army officer, and Sondhi Limthongkul, a newspaper owner.  Chamlong told a crowd assembled inside the compound in the country&apos;s capital Bangkok: &quot;We are ready to spend time in jail. The (alliance) will continue to protest until our demands are met. This government has to resign.&quot; The alliance has been organising protests against the government since May. In 2006 its demonstrations helped undermine the government of the then prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra. Now it is attempting to force the prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, and his government to step down. The group claims his administration serves as a proxy for Thaksin, who was ousted in a 2006 coup and faces corruption charges.  The interior minister, Kowit Watana, has appealed to the several thousand protesters encamped outside Samak&apos;s offices to leave immediately. Samak has refused to sanction force to remove them, claiming organisers are attempting to incite violence that could prompt conditions for another coup.  About 2,000 Thai police continue to face the demonstrators on the grounds of Government House, but alliance leaders said the protest would continue even if they were arrested.  Last night around 500 riot police forced their way into the compound and clashed with the crowd. Fighting stopped after a few minutes and police were able to take up positions inside. The alliance, which is loosely aligned with conservative factions of the monarchy and the military, said its protests were a &quot;final showdown&quot; in efforts to oust the government.  &quot;If we leave before this government resigns, that means we are defeated,&quot; Chamlong said.  The takeover of Government House is the latest twist in a political crisis that began in early 2006, when critics of Thaksin first sought to force him from office over allegations of corruption and abuse of power.  After Thaksin was deposed in the bloodless coup, his party was dissolved and he was banned from public office until 2012.  But Samak led Thaksin&apos;s political allies to a December 2007 election victory, and their assumption of power triggered fears that Thaksin would make a political comeback. He remains popular with the rural majority.  The alliance responded by resuming its protests in May, accusing Samak of trying to amend the constitution to free Thaksin from a string of corruption charges.  Thaksin left Thailand before his corruption hearing and went to England, claiming he would not get a fair trial in his own country.  Samak told reporters yesterday that the government would not use force to eject the protesters, but was preparing legal action against them. &quot;They want bloodshed in the country. They want the military to come out and do the coup again.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-08-27T13:01:15Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Protest", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/27/thailand", "title": "Thai court orders arrest of nine anti-government protesters", "sentences": ["Chamlong told a crowd assembled inside the compound in the country&apos;s capital Bangkok: &quot;We are ready to spend time in jail."]}, {"article": "Neither deaf nor mute but still murders his lines ... Nicolas Cage in Bangkok Dangerous &quot;My job takes me to a lot of places. The work is steady, the money&apos;s good...&quot; Here we go again. Nicolas Cage stars in Bangkok Dangerous, the Pang brothers&apos; forthcoming Hollywood remake of their own 1999 Thai movie of the same name, which was about a deaf-mute hitman. To judge by the trailer Cage isn&apos;t deaf-mute. (A shame, because even in the trailer his emotionless monotone is already getting on my nerves.) But he is a hitman. What is it about hitmen? (And apologies to all you feminist hitwomen out there, but &quot;hitperson&quot; lacks that je ne sais quoi, so I&apos;m sticking to the masculine form.) They&apos;re all over the bloody place - and, pace Tom Cruise in Collateral, they&apos;re hardly ever villains. They&apos;re loveable and bumbling like Colin Farrell in In Bruges, loveable and inebriated like Ben Kingsley in You Kill Me, machinelike but principled like Timothy Olyphant in Hitman, or possessed of fabulous superpowers, like James McAvoy and Angelina Jolie in Wanted. How is it that characters who are, essentially, mercenary murderers are nowadays being offered up to us as heroes, whose killing skills we are expected to applaud and admire? Few of us have ever (knowingly) met a hitman, and yet they&apos;re so ubiquitous in today&apos;s action-adventure genre that if you were a Martian observer, watching movies to pick up tips on how we earthlings live, you might be forgiven for concluding it was a viable career choice, up there with firefighter or teacher. Indeed, contract killing being a job like any other was part of the central joke of Grosse Point Blank, in which hitman John Cusack confides in his shrink, attends his high-school reunion and turns down an invitation to join the union. Hitmen are descendants of Western gunslingers like Gregory Peck in The Gunfighter or Alan Ladd in Shane, though even when those films were made, a half-century ago, there was acknowledgement that such killers had already outlived their usefulness and had no place in civilised society. But modern cinema, evidently, isn&apos;t so civilised, because professional killers are thriving in it. Sometimes they&apos;re avatars for aficionados of shoot-em-up computer games (as is clearly the case with Hitman), or macho wish-fulfilment figures like James Bond, whose licence-to-kill credentials were depicted more explicitly in Casino Royale than in earlier Bond films. There&apos;s a substantial sub-subgenre, pioneered by the French in films like Le Samoura\u00ef or Leon: The Professional, in which the hitherto infallible killer gets softened up by love or children, which invariably makes him more human and leads to his demise. (And we&apos;re expected to weep for him, not rejoice that a cold-blooded murderer has been taken out of circulation.) In another popular variation, the hitman is double-crossed by his paymasters and finds himself pitted against other assassins who are trying to take him down (the Bourne films, Kill Bill). There is, admittedly, a thrill to be had in watching a task well done, like Forest Whitaker executing his contracts in Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (for which, incidentally, Jim Jarmusch &quot;borrowed&quot; most of his elaborate set-pieces from Seijun Suzuki&apos;s delirious 1967 masterpiece Branded to Kill, probably the first movie to posit the idea of a Hitman League Table). He is supremely versatile, equally at home in science fiction (The Terminator movies), horror films (John Carpenter&apos;s Vampires, Van Helsing) or comedy (The Matador, The Whole Nine Yards). But at bottom may I remind you, he is someone who kills for money. Whereas this might once have been cause for contempt, nowadays, perversely, it makes him more trustworthy. In a world of ambiguous and constantly shifting morality - one man&apos;s terrorist is another&apos;s freedom fighter, one man&apos;s democratic government is another&apos;s imperialist tyranny and so on - the hitman&apos;s purely financial motives and lack of emotional or ideological ties equip him with a form of objective moral code, making him a fixed point of identification amid all the betrayals and double-dealings. But far from being a romantic rule-breaker, ronin or rebel operating beyond the restraints of society, he is a mere tool of the system. The ultimate businessman, in fact. Isn&apos;t it about time we stopped treating him like one of the good guys?", "publicationDate": "2008-08-27T23:00:01Z", "tags": ["Film"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2008/aug/28/mostwanted", "title": "The curious allure of hitmen at the movies", "sentences": ["Neither deaf nor mute but still murders his lines ...

The demonstrators, estimated to number almost 15,000, stormed the grounds of Government House in Bangkok on Tuesday afternoon in what they called a &quot;final showdown&quot; following three months of demonstrations to try to remove the administration of Samak Sundaravej. Samak, a 73-year-old political veteran who has been prime minister for seven months, has insisted he will not use force to remove the demonstrators. But yesterday a court issued warrants for the arrests of nine protest leaders on charges of insurrection.  Late last night another court ruling ordered the activists to leave the compound immediately.  &quot;The prime minister said it has to end,&quot; Samak&apos;s chief spokesman told Reuters. &quot;Thousands of police will be deployed to move the protesters out of the Government House.&quot; The demonstrators vowed defiance. &quot;We will not allow police to arrest our leaders,&quot; Samran Rodpetch, one of the organisers, told a cheering crowd. &quot;If the police want to arrest them, come here and do so, or if they want our leaders to give themselves up that is fine, but the government has to resign first.&quot; The best-known leader of the group, Chamlong Srimuang, who headed anti-government protests in 1992 that ended in troops firing on crowds, said they would remain.  &quot;If we leave before this government resigns, that means we are defeated,&quot; he said. The action is led by the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy, which spearheaded the mass protests in 2006 that paved the way for the military coup overthrowing the then-prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra. Thaksin, the billionaire telecoms tycoon and Manchester City football club owner, faces corruption charges at home. He has skipped bail and is now based in the UK. Earlier this month a Thai court said he and his wife would be tried in their absence. Thaksin insists the charges are politically motivated.  Samak took power after his People&apos;s Power party won the most seats in a December general election, the first since Thaksin was ousted.  The People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy claims his government is effectively a proxy for Thaksin, who remains popular with many Thais, and has obstructed investigations into the former prime minister&apos;s alleged misdeeds. Four weeks of street protests calling for Samak&apos;s resignation culminated with activists breaking through police lines to blockade Government House, the seat of Thailand&apos;s government. The group previously laid siege to Government House in June, following weeks of anti-Samak protests. At the time, the prime minister sought to distance himself from Thaksin. The current action has thus far been mainly peaceful and Samak has said he does not want to use force, claiming the demonstrators are seeking violence in the hope of provoking another coup.  The head of the military, General Anupong Paochinda, said this week that troops would remain in barracks. But attitudes appear now to be hardening, with the prime minister&apos;s spokesman promising &quot;decisive action&quot; in the event of any violence. Last night Thai television was reporting that doctors and ambulances were on standby at police headquarters as police trucks massed near the prime minister&apos;s compound. The protest alliance, which allies itself with conservative elements in the military and the country&apos;s hugely influential royal family, has also briefly seized a government-run TV station and besieged four government ministries. Its mass support, however, appears shaky. One survey suggested that almost three-quarters of people in Bangkok opposed the protests.

The demonstrators from the rightwing People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy are calling on the prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, to resign, accusing him of being a proxy for former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 coup and, from his exile in Britain, faces several corruption cases. Samak ordered 1,000 riot police to close in on the Government House compound yesterday but has deliberately refrained from ordering the use of force.  &quot;I have a sword, but I have chosen not to use it,&quot; he told reporters from his temporary headquarters in a military compound in a north Bangkok. &quot;It will be too dangerous.&quot;  He has accused the protesters of seeking to provoke a violent government response in the hope that the military will step in with another coup. The army commander has publically insisted that troops will not get involved. Overnight, dozens of protesters wearing military fatigues and armed with golf clubs, batons and bamboo sticks stood guard around the compound. They locked most of the gates and built up makeshift barriers of tyres in anticipation of a police raid. Thousands more protesters poured into the occupied area in response to the court order, and many formed a human chain overnight around the group&apos;s top leaders to prevent them from being taken away. Observers put the total number at around 10,000.  The atmosphere was a cross between a festival and a political rally as they listened to to folk music and vitriol against Samak and his elected government. Retired general Chamlong Srimuang, an influential former politician and army officer and one of the top alliance leaders, said the protesters are doing nothing wrong. &quot;We are staging a protest because the government has made too many mistakes and has no legitimacy to run the country,&quot; he said. But deputy police spokesman Maj Gen. Suraphol Tuanthong said the arrest warrants against the leaders were for insurrection, conspiracy, illegal assembly and refusing orders to disperse. Insurrection, which is the legal equivalent of treason, carries a maximum penalty of death or life imprisonment. Samak initially said he hoped the protesters would be out ahead of a ceremony on Saturday for Thailand&apos;s royal family. But today he proposed moving the royal procession to another site. The climb-down only intensified speculation that Samak and the government are under pressure from anonymous PAD backers thought to come from the anti-Thaksin business elite, army or even the palace. Revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who is officially above politics but who has intervened several times on a variety of sides during his six decades on the throne, has made no public pronouncements since the PAD launched its assault on Tuesday. Alliance leaders said the group planned to appeal the court order to vacate the government compound.

A state of emergency would allow the government to deploy soldiers to disperse the protesters, although army chief Anupong Paochinda said the situation did not warrant it. Less than two years after a coup against the former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, Anupong said another putsch would not resolve the deep divisions in Thai society. &quot;A coup would not solve anything. It will hurt the country&apos;s image and worsen the country&apos;s situation,&quot; he told reporters.  The Thai police surrounding the 11 acre Government House compound which was occupied by thousands of protesters on Tuesday have been told not to provoke a confrontation.  But there were scuffles and around two dozen people were arrested when the police delivered an eviction order against the supporters of the conservative People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy who are seeking to oust the government. And, according to Reuters, about 2,000 demonstrators were sprayed with tear gas when they were repulsed from an attack on Bangkok&apos;s police headquarters. There were also reports of protesters trying to blockade two southern airports and a partial strike by state rail workers.  The PAD, whose 2005 protests against then prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra contributed to his removal in a coup a year later, urged more supporters to gather at the compound until the current elected administration fell. &quot;Move in and circle around me.

Detroit can&apos;t make a car anyone will buy, and half the Big Three&apos;s car plants are offshore where cheap labour abounds. What Americans wear on their backs or plug into their walls is made in Asian sweatshops and factories, which screws up the trade balance and slashes domestic jobs.  Now consider the Los Angeles-based movie industry as a kind of stand-alone nation-state economy and one finds that all of this is replicated. Bangkok Dangerous is the latest in a long series of Asian thrillers remade for the American market, a kind of imported brainware to which the American buyers have added no creative input or value. The Pang brothers were also behind the The Eye, now remade with sequel to boot. Hideo Nakata&apos;s Ringu and Dark Water have both been rancidly remade, along with Takashi Shimizu&apos;s Ju-on: The Grudge series.  And they&apos;re just part of a flood. Among the Asian titles already released or licensed for future remake are Mirrors (with Kiefer Sutherland), The Lake House (with Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves), Old Boy, Addicted, Chaos, Shutter, A Tale of Two Sisters and many more. Even Korean monster movie The Host, not exactly crying out for a remake after its success last year, is getting the deluxe retread treatment. The Departed, Scorsese&apos;s Oscar-winning rehash of Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs, has a lot to answer for. And meanwhile the jobs go elsewhere. Toronto and Vancouver look just like America once you tear down all that bilingual signage, and have their own moviemaking infrastructures and film commissions. And take Shreveport, Louisiana, where tax incentives have drawn producers for years. Factory Girl, The Cleaner, The Guardian, Homeland Security, Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay, D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu and even the Bush biopic W, were all shot there. Back in LA the industry&apos;s skilled blue-collar footsoldiery - set builders, sound designers and so on - is tightening its collective belt every day. No wonder writer-director Jon Favreau is heading an initiative to keep production in Los Angeles. Movie stars are Australian, South African and Canadian. Major villains are Brits (as usual), cameramen are Italians and Germans, and so on. Ideas keep coming from elsewhere, and projects get filmed elsewhere. David Simon&apos;s Wire follow-up Generation Kill was made by Brits in South Africa, The Office is a British import. And since Hugh Laurie in House and Ian McShane in Deadwood, every network has two or more new dramas starring Brits like Rufus Sewell, Damien Lewis, Lena Headey, and Jonny Lee Miller.

Some 15,000 people were turned away from the airport on the holiday island of Phuket after protesters from the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD) stormed the runway and terminals. Stranded passengers had to carry their bags through cordons to a nearby road where they were forced to hail cabs to take them back to their resorts. The chaos has sparked concerns that thousands of children will now miss the start of the British school term. The airports at Krabi, now rivalling Phuket as Thailand&apos;s No 1 tourist spot, was also closed, as was the airport at Haad Yai in the south. Last night demonstrators were also heading for Surat Thani airport, around three hours north of Phuket. &apos;We want to bring government corruption to the attention of the world,&apos; said a PAD spokesman. Having spent their holiday cash, many tourists were wondering how they would get home and find accommodation in the interim. The Tourist Authority of Thailand has asked hoteliers to give stranded tourists discounted or free accommodation, but almost all those from Britain have lost connections on to London which they booked months in advance. Last night many tried to make their connections by bus, minibus and taxi in a 13- hour road trip to Bangkok, but PAD said they were also setting up road blocks on major roads into the capital. They insisted however that they were not targeting tourists and the protests have remained largely peaceful, though further chaos is predicted. Thailand&apos;s railway system is already 70 per cent out of action due to action by unions in support of the PAD demonstrations. Unions at the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, have threatened action against the national grid and the Thai Airlines union is threatening to join the protests. The PAD began their massive demonstrations four days ago demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej and his cabinet. The group argues that corrupt politicians have been able to buy themselves into power. PAD leaders claim that Samak and his cabinet intend to plunder the country, a charge which they brought against the former Premier Thaksin Shinawatra, now owner of Manchester City FC. The protesters are angry that Thaksin and his wife Pojaman were allowed to flee Thailand after she was jailed and he was charged with corruption.  As the government battles to restore its authority, arrest warrants for treason have been issued against the PAD leaders, who include media magnate Sondhi Limthongkul, former Bangkok governor Chamlong Srimuang, Pibhop Dhongchai, an academic, and labour leader Somsak Kosaisuk. However, police have so far been unable to serve the warrants.  After meeting King Bhumipol Adulyadej at his summer palace in Hua Hin, Samak insisted he would not back down. Bhumibol&apos;s support is crucial. Although he is a constitutional monarch with no formal political role, he has repeatedly brought calm in times of turbulence during his 60 years on the throne. &apos;I, the Prime Minister, have come to office in the righteous way and I won&apos;t resign,&apos; Samak said. &apos;I will not back down. I will rule this country and will lead it through all of the problems.&apos; He also defended himself against critics who say he should not have let protesters overrun Government House in Bangkok: &apos;I have been very patient and have refrained from using force.&apos;  But Samak&apos;s position looks fragile. Army commander General Anupong Paochinda has rejected his request to declare a state of emergency, and the Chart Thai Party, a member of Samak&apos;s six-party coalition, said it was ready to suggest the Prime Minister step down. Last night thousands of protesters remained camped out at Government House, where leaders called for a million people to join their ranks and demand an end to Samak&apos;s seven-month tenure. &apos;The protest has already developed into a people&apos;s revolution,&apos; said protest leader Sondhi Limthongkul. &apos;I do believe that Samak is going to resign.&apos;", "publicationDate": "2008-08-30T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Travel", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/31/thailand", "title": "Thousands of UK tourists trapped by Thai protests", "sentences": ["Last night many tried to make their connections by bus, minibus and taxi in a 13- hour road trip to Bangkok, but PAD said they were also setting up road blocks on major roads into the capital.", "As the government battles to restore its authority, arrest warrants for treason have been issued against the PAD leaders, who include media magnate Sondhi Limthongkul, former Bangkok governor Chamlong Srimuang, Pibhop Dhongchai, an academic, and labour leader Somsak Kosaisuk.", "I will rule this country and will lead it through all of the problems.&apos; He also defended himself against critics who say he should not have let protesters overrun Government House in Bangkok: &apos;I have been very patient and have refrained from using force.&apos;  But Samak&apos;s position looks fragile."]}, {"article": "Early on Friday 1 August 2008, Nicholas Rice made a mistake that may just have saved his life. He spilled a pan of water. The Californian was sitting in his tent at Camp IV on the shoulder of K2&apos;s south-east ridge, preparing to leave for the summit. Getting ready to do anything at 7,900 metres above sea level takes a long time. Melting the snow for that pan of water must have taken an hour. It&apos;s as if time accelerates, leaving you plodding along behind, taking an age to put on boots, an epoch to fasten crampons and zip up clothing. To a brain fogged from lack of oxygen, mistakes come easily. Rice had planned to be on his way at 3am, but the mishap set him back. As he fumbled the pan, water had slopped over his socks. Stuffing his feet into high-altitude climbing boots when they were wet did not appeal. He risked frostbite setting out like that, so he decided to dry them out first. For a 23-year-old, Rice has a lot of high-altitude experience and a wise head on his young shoulders. K2 would still be there next year. The trick, as British mountaineer Don Whillans used to say, would be to make sure that he was. Once his socks were dry, Rice headed out into the freezing Karakoram morning. With around 30 climbers ahead of him, the route to the summit was clearly marked. From the tents at Camp IV, a snow slope steepens gradually as it rises to meet a band of rock about 250m up the slope. Kicking his feet into the steps left by the other climbers, Rice began to follow them. He was the last man to leave for the summit that day. The steps led to a snow-filled gully in the left-hand end of the rock band that sits beneath an enormous ice cliff, called a serac, some 90m high at its apex. A serac forms when a glacier pushes over a steep drop on a mountainside. As this ice creeps down the mountain, chunks drop off without warning. Warmer conditions can provoke a serac fall, but they also happen in the dead of night. What tons of falling ice will do to a body does not take much imagination. For this reason, mountaineers avoid climbing underneath seracs - if they can. Yet, sometimes, the only practicable route means exposing yourself to the possibility that a huge mass of ice might break off and crush you at any moment. The top of the south-east ridge on K2 is one of those places. It is the kind of situation in which you have to make a simple calculation: is this worth it? Rice knew that where the gully ran up against the gleaming grey ice of the serac, the footsteps would turn left to where the ice cliff diminished. The ground here is more awkward and steeper. It takes climbers to the ridgeline above the vast gulf of the mountain&apos;s south face, a drop of 3,000m to the glacier. It is also the key to passing the overhanging serac and reaching the easier-angled slopes above, which lead to the summit. This section is called the Bottleneck. Even before this summer, more than 10 climbers had died here. After an hour&apos;s effort, Rice began to reconsider his attempt. He was not using bottled oxygen and, despite the effort of punching up the snow slope, his hands stayed frozen. &apos;I could have summitted,&apos; he told America&apos;s NPR radio via satellite phone a few days later, &apos;but I wasn&apos;t going to lose a finger. Not even the tip of a finger.&apos; Rice could feel the day turning against him. He could see dozens of climbers ahead, in their own private worlds as they struggled towards the summit. Their sheer number was a threat. He could feel his fingers wooden inside his mitts. His instinct nagged at him to descend, so he did. Released from the agony of grinding uphill, Rice was soon back in his sleeping bag. Little more than a day later, 11 of the climbers gasping in the thin air above Rice&apos;s tent were dead, turning the 2008 season into the second-worst on record.  K2. &apos;K&apos; for Karakoram, which is the name of the range of mountains, &apos;2&apos; as opposed to K1, which, as the 1856 Survey of India discovered, had a local name, Masherbrum. K2 was just too remote for the locals to bother. Those who see it up close for the first time are left in a state of mild shock. At Concordia, where the Baltoro Glacier meets the Godwin-Austen Glacier flowing from K2, it fills the sky. Reinhold Messner, the first person to climb all of the world&apos;s peaks over 8,000m, once said: &apos;An artist made this peak.&apos; Its irregular triangle snags a climber&apos;s mind like a barbed hook. On the Pakistan side, the altitude at Concordia is 4,700m, just three hours from base camp, while the summit rises up almost another 4km into the deep blue of high altitude. On its steeper north side, in China, it climbs 3.2km in just 3km of horizontal distance. The Australian Greg Child, who reached the summit by its north ridge in 1990, summed up the appeal: &apos;K2 just has something about it. Partly it&apos;s the shape and beauty and symmetry of the thing. And partly it&apos;s the infamy - the stories of what&apos;s happened to people who&apos;ve tried it: how fucked up they&apos;ve become and how many have died. K2 is simply not an amateur&apos;s mountain.&apos; The bald statistics are bad enough. There have been around 300 ascents of K2, and 77 deaths. Journalists frequently divide the first number by the second to come up with a death rate of one in four. That is way off the mark. The first figure does not include those who don&apos;t reach the summit. Even so, the fatality rate among those who do make the top is around 11 per cent, worse odds than one in 10 and an indication that it is in the descent that many of the dangers lie. When friends go to Everest, it does not trouble me. On the far fewer occasions one goes to K2, I feel anxious. I felt it most strongly talking to English climber Alison Hargreaves, just before she left in 1995 on the second leg of her attempt to climb the three highest mountains in the world in one year. She was blasted off the summit ridge by hurricane winds on 13 August, killed along with five others. Eight died that season, five the year before. And five the year before that. When Nicholas Rice moved up to make his summit bid, he had been on the mountain for more than two months. K2 base camp is not an easy place to be for that length of time. After two months, sleeping in a tent and defecating al fresco begin to grate. Jim Curran, who witnessed the 1986 tragedy, when 13 climbers from nine different parties died, and wrote a definitive history of the mountain, saw first-hand the slow mental attrition of waiting for a chance at the summit. From Everest base camp, he explains, you can walk four hours and be lounging on grass, drinking beer with trekkers. It takes more than a week to trek the 40 miles from the last village to K2 base camp. &apos;K2 stands absolutely on its own. The approach is hard. The base camp feels like the Moon. The mountain itself looks utterly impregnable, and there&apos;s no easy way up the thing.&apos; Worse, the weather is like a slow form of torture. Once acclimatised, climbers wait in nervous anticipation. On Everest, weather patterns are predictable. Climbers expect a weather window during the latter half of May. On K2, you cannot be sure when, or even if, good weather will arrive. Three seasons this decade there has been no ascent at all. That has not happened on Everest since 1974. &apos;The problem is that the good weather spell is often enough to get to you to the top but not to get you down again,&apos; Curran says. Of course, given that no one knows for sure how long the good weather will last, when - if - it arrives, those climbers still interested rush up the mountain. That is why K2&apos;s accidents often happen all at once and it is what happened at the end of this July. A number of teams converged at Camp IV on the shoulder of the south-east ridge, some via the Abruzzi Spur, others up a parallel route on a spur to the left called the Cesen Route. The latter included Wilco van Rooijen from Holland and members of his international team. Van Rooijen had been to K2 before and had climbed Everest without oxygen. Irish climber Gerard McDonnell was part of this group. They had been on the mountain longer than anyone else, the first of a reported 16 expeditions to climb on K2 this season, and were making their third attempt on the summit. With that number of expeditions there were bound to be tensions. You need to co-operate, but you do not want to let a less competent party spoil your summit bid. Especially if you have been waiting two months. Rice also used the Cesen Route. Joining him was a Frenchman, Hugues d&apos;Aubar\u00e8de, an insurance agent from Lyon, aged 61 and on his third expedition to K2. At that age, time was not on his side. He had come alone with two Pakistani porters to support him, Meherban Karim and Jehan Baig. D&apos;Aubar\u00e8de said that over the course of the expedition he came to regard Rice like a son. A Korean team had fixed rope on the Abruzzi Spur and they, too, were at Camp IV. There were also teams from Italy and Serbia, and strong Norwegian and Basque climbers. One of the Italians was a professional mountain rescuer, Marco Confortola; the Norwegians included 33-year-old called Rolf Bae and his new wife Cecilie Skog, a former nurse who is the only woman to have completed the so-called &apos;explorer&apos;s grand slam&apos; (climbing the highest peak on each continent and reaching both poles). Bae, a world-class polar traveller, had just spent 27 days climbing a vertical and overhanging granite wall called Great Trango Tower in northern Pakistan, a climb far harder than K2. Finally, there was an American-led expedition that included Australians and a Swede, Fredrik Strang. Later, from his hospital bed, van Rooijen would say that there had been too many climbers on the mountain that day. Some of these expeditions were marriages of convenience, sharing the cost of logistics to achieve a personal goal. Some were close-knit teams from the same country. Some climbers were much stronger than others. And some, according to comments Confortola made later, were not as good as they thought they were. He called these, sarcastically, &apos;professori&apos;. Critically, all these groups understood co-operation was vital, especially in the business of fixing ropes. But things don&apos;t always work out that way, especially when language differences mean K2 is, most years, a 4km-high tower of Babel.  At 11pm on the night of 31 July, as Nicholas Rice rested in his tent, he was disturbed by Sherpas and Pakistani porters getting ready to leave for the upper section of the mountain. Although none of these expeditions was a commercial guided trip of the kind now seen on Everest, many of them had hired one or two Sherpas, flown in from Nepal to add logistical muscle. Victor Saunders, an experienced Everest guide whose company Basecamp is organising an expedition to K2 next summer, says bringing one Sherpa over costs around \u00a35,000. But they are worth the money. &apos;When the Pakistanis are good,&apos; he says, &apos;they are very good. But currently they are not as reliable or experienced as the Sherpas.&apos; Given that the local population and the Sherpas both speak a dialect of Tibetan, the two groups, Muslim and Buddhist, can work together well. But on the morning of 1 August, the Sherpas were anxious because, according to Rice, the Pakistani porters were slow to get going and in poor morale. It was these porters&apos; job to go ahead and fix ropes at the steeper sections of the Bottleneck, to give those that followed extra security and a fast way off the mountain. A complex deal, some of which was lost in translation, had been agreed between the Dutch, Italians, Koreans and Americans about who would do what to ensure that sufficient rope was properly fixed and that the route was marked. Some K2 climbers may feel this was asking for trouble. It seems the first Western climber to leave was the Basque, Alberto Zerain. He alone would have a perfect summit day. At around 2.30am, Rice heard the Dutch team, d&apos;Aubar\u00e8de and the Serbians leaving camp. Later, the Italians, Norwegians and finally the Americans left, crampons squeaking in the snow, breath rasping in the dry air, as they climbed off into the night, their headlamps points of light on the black mountain.  At 7am, after his aborted attempt, Rice woke in his tent. The Americans were coming back. They told him that the Sherpas and Pakistanis had not fixed the rope at the top of the snow gully and across the traverse, but lower down where it wasn&apos;t needed. Not wanting to stand around while the ropes were brought up and fixed on the more difficult traverse, and anxious about the numbers of climbers, they had decided to go back to Camp IV. Other teams waited. That, at least, is what Rice put on his blog when he got back to base camp. But it&apos;s not what Confortola said in a phone interview after his agonising descent. He said that five Sherpas had been assigned to fix the traverse out of the Bottleneck, but that others had completed this task using low-quality anchors fixed into the ice and cheap rope. &apos;You couldn&apos;t even tie hay bales with it.&apos; Who fixed these ropes is one of several unanswered questions, but if it wasn&apos;t the Sherpas, it was most likely the Pakistani porters. Sorting these ropes out took time and slowed the climbers down. Getting up and down in daylight was everyone&apos;s priority. At around 8am, a Serbian, 32-year-old Dren Mandic, became detached from the fixed rope and fell, his body accelerating down the slope before coming to rest above Camp IV.  Accounts differ as to how he came to be off the rope - perhaps he was trying to overtake another climber - but van Rooijen said: &apos;That was a really stupid accident. These accidents are not supposed to happen on K2. People are not used to climbing these technical parts. Everest you can climb without technical experience.&apos; Traversing out of the Bottleneck, he said, is &apos;a very technical traverse at 8,200 metres&apos;. The other Serbians and their porters descended to help Mandic, but he was already dead. Two of the American team who had returned to Camp IV, Strang and Eric Meyer, climbed back up to see if they could help bring Mandic&apos;s body down, only to find a chaotic scene. In the rush to help, one of the porters, Jehan Baig, also lost his footing and fell to his death. When Strang brought news of this back to Camp IV, Rice packed at once to descend. His K2 season was over. Confortola says it was he who refocused the group on getting busy with the climb and, once they did, progress was better. The Koreans were using oxygen and drew ahead of the Norwegians, followed by the Dutch, Confortola, d&apos;Aubar\u00e8de, and McDonnell. But the first to reach the summit, at 3pm, was Alberto Zerain. Not bothering to wait while the ropes were sorted out, he had climbed on, reaching the top with plenty of daylight left to make a safe descent. Two of the Norwegians, Cecilie Skog and Lars Naesse, reached the summit two hours later. Oystein Stangeland had turned back earlier, for reasons that have not yet become clear, while Rolf Bae, perhaps exhausted from his climb on Great Trango, had fallen behind on the ascent. According to a spokesman for the Norwegians, Bj\u00f8rn Sekkes\u00e6ter, the three reconvened just below the summit and made the descent together with Bae in the lead. As he crossed back into the Bottleneck, he caught the full force of a huge chunk of ice that peeled off the serac some time in the early evening. &apos;Cecilie was behind Rolf, attached by rope, and she felt a shiver,&apos; Sekkes\u00e6ter reports. &apos;It only took Rolf; the rope snapped under the weight of the ice.&apos; Bae was killed outright.  One can only imagine what Skog must have been feeling; the couple had been married since just May 2007. However, she needed to continue the descent and the ropes that had been set up earlier had now been washed away by the ice slide. She and Naesse used a 100m Kevlar rope to abseil down one of the steeper sections, but the line was not long enough. They were forced to climb down backwards until they reached the less precarious part of the shoulder on the south-east ridge. They eventually reached Camp IV between 11pm and midnight. &apos;Rolf&apos;s accident was pure bad luck,&apos; Sekkes\u00e6ter told OSM. &apos;He didn&apos;t trip, he didn&apos;t make a mistake. Other people died from doing the wrong thing, like unclipping themselves from the rope... But he wanted to be on K2, so he was on the right spot at the wrong time.&apos;  In a seemingly unrelated incident, Jumic Bhote, one of the Koreans&apos; Nepalese porters, was also hit by ice, and a second Nepalese, Pasang Bhote, tried to help him. Both fell to their deaths. Above the Bottleneck, a number of climbers were either just reaching the summit or were on their way down. These included Wilco van Rooijen and Cas van de Gevel with their Sherpa Pemba Gyalje, Gerard McDonnell - the first Irishman to climb K2 - Marco Confortola, and Hugues d&apos;Aubar\u00e8de with his Pakistani high-altitude porter, Meherban Karim. &apos;I&apos;m too cold,&apos; d&apos;Aubar\u00e8de told friends at home from the summit via satellite phone. &apos;I&apos;m too happy.&apos; Three of the Koreans, Park Kyeong-hyo, 28, Kim Hyo-gyeong, 33, and Hwang Dong-jin, 44, were also still descending to the Bottleneck.  Confortola knew they had to hurry. He reached the top at 7pm in temperatures of -20C. As night fell, this would plummet to something like -40C. In down suits but with no tents or sleeping bags, or a stove to melt snow, surviving the night would be a bitter struggle. All the climbers had missed the previous night&apos;s sleep. None would be able to get much rest that night either. And they were still above 8,000m. In the death zone. &apos;I was with the Dutch,&apos; Confortola says. &apos;I kept looking at my wristwatch. We were so late. On the top I&apos;ve literally taken four pictures, and then we started down. Problem was, during the descent, no one had the route flags we had agreed to bring. I had a few in my sack, but not enough. And during the night, a bit tired, a bit confused because we climbed without oxygen, disaster struck.&apos; There was no moon as he descended with McDonnell. The two had become good friends, despite the language barrier, and Confortola had nicknamed McDonnell &apos;Jesus&apos;, because of his beard. At 8.30pm, still above the serac barrier, Confortola heard a sound and told the Irishman to stop. Below, they could see the three Koreans had fallen or been hit by ice. Assuming they could not survive the fall, Confortola decided enough was enough, and suggested they bivouac. They would go on when they could see what was happening.  Later, reports claimed that the 10 climbers were trapped above the Bottleneck because the ropes had been swept away when Rolf Bae died. But Cas van de Gevel and Sherpa Pemba Gyalje managed to use what light was left to descend to Camp IV that evening. It was the lack of visibility that stopped the others. In the morning they would be able to see to climb the difficult ground back to the gully leading down to Camp IV. Confortola dug shallow pits to sit in, perched above the huge drop of the south face. He extended McDonnell&apos;s a little because the Irishman was suffering more. Wilco van Rooijen, similarly disorientated, also bivouacked. Hugues d&apos;Aubar\u00e8de, older and running on empty, seems to have collapsed and died on the descent from the summit. His porter Meherban Karim fell, attempting to climb down without him. During the night Confortola had rubbed the Irishman&apos;s legs while he made himself shiver to keep his body temperature up. In the morning, he and McDonnell were in a state of abject exhaustion. At first light, he saw van Rooijen descending. They tried to talk to each other but, Confortola says: &apos;My English is awful.&apos; After the Dutchman was gone, McDonnell moved across the slope to urinate and spotted the Koreans. They were still alive. He called out to Confortola. Struggling down the ropes, Confortola and McDonnell tried to improvise a rescue. The Koreans had spent the night hanging off a fixed rope and were most probably beyond saving. At least one was badly injured, and two were unconscious. Confortola noticed one had lost his gloves and boots, so he stuck a spare glove on his exposed foot. The Koreans&apos; limbs would have been frozen solid, but still, Confortola tried to get them upright. Time seemed to slide past unnoticed. At 3pm, four Sherpas arrived to help and Confortola abandoned his efforts to save the Koreans in order to save himself. &apos;I tried everything and more, but I simply couldn&apos;t do it, could not take them back home. In my role of mountain rescuer I felt worthless, I felt useless. I come down, do the traverse, descend the Bottleneck, and then at the bottom I hear this big booming noise. I look up and 400 metres above there&apos;s this big avalanche coming down from the serac, and below some boots. I&apos;ve recognised them - it was Jesus.&apos; With the Koreans beyond help, and McDonnell dead, one of the Sherpas, Pemba, brought Confortola down to Camp IV. Even then they were hit by another fall of ice. Then Pemba went out to look for van Rooijen, who had failed to find the camp. They missed each other. Van Rooijen had descended on the wrong side of the ridgeline as clouds gathered, obscuring features that could have guided him home. He was forced to spend a second night out, his lips and tongue blistered from dehydration, his mind hallucinating wildly as exhaustion took its toll. Next day he stumbled into Camp III on the Cesen Route, where team-mates fed him drink and oxygen. The combination of the high death toll and K2&apos;s grim reputation put the tragedy high on news bulletins around the world. Stories of desperate rescue attempts and climbers trapped high on the mountain were fed by phone calls and emails from base camp. Very quickly, those early news stories gave way to gloomy commentaries on the credentials of those tackling the mountain. After putting the story on the front page, the New York Times website was filled with readers&apos; comments, mostly saying the same thing: &apos;Utterly pointless&apos;; &apos;Reckless incompetents commit utterly predictable suicide&apos;; &apos;No sympathy. Sorry.&apos; Under the headline &apos;Does Climbing Matter Anymore?&apos;, the paper quoted veterans including Reinhold Messner railing against what climbing on K2 had become: &apos;People today are booking these K2 package deals almost as if they were buying some all-inclusive trip to Bangkok.&apos; Mountaineer and historian David Roberts warned that money was warping the motivation of those on the highest peaks. True, there were some old-school climbers around, &apos;but now climbers are sponsored. They are making big bucks on speaking tours. There is a whole new breed of wannabes who see it as a shortcut to fame or at least notoriety.&apos; To older mountaineers, there were some obvious ironies in these comments. Messner, after all, has made a fortune from sponsorship deals and lecture tours. He had dubbed K2 the &apos;mountain of mountains&apos; on the cover of one of his many books. In the building of K2&apos;s brand, the Italian lent a considerable hand. To suggest K2&apos;s slopes were clogged with incompetents was laughable. Still, it must be irksome for those who have shared in K2&apos;s greatest triumphs, the noble rescues, the dedicated teamwork, to see that heritage diluted by the image of lesser talents who buy and bluff their way to the kind of glory true heroes earned the hard way. Imagine if you could pay cash to play in a rematch of the 1966 World Cup final. And now imagine how Bobby Charlton would feel about that. As it happens, those mountaineers breaking new ground are rarely found on K2 these days. They do not rely on ropes fixed to the mountain by someone else. They do not use porters. K2 was first climbed as long ago as 1954 via the Abruzzi Spur. It&apos;s tough, it&apos;s dangerous even by Himalayan standards, and it gets respect from the very best. But standards have moved on since 1954. A lot. Messner, however, has left a curious legacy. A dozen or so others have now repeated his feat of climbing the 14 peaks over the height of 8,000m, including Briton Alan Hinkes. The simplicity of the idea and the fact that most of these peaks are well known makes it an easy sell to sponsors. It&apos;s like a freakishly dangerous form of Munro-bagging. Partly thanks to Messner&apos;s list, many of these giant peaks - Everest, K2, Nanga Parbat - are fixed in the public&apos;s imagination. The routes of their first ascents, done more than 50 years ago, attract more climbers than all the other thousands of peaks in the Himalaya put together. A small semi-nomadic international community of high-altitude climbers return again and again to these Himalayan giants like bees to a flower. The attrition rate seems quite horrendous to outsiders, but it&apos;s a dramatic, adventurous life that attracts dramatic, adventurous people. The aftershocks of this year&apos;s season on K2 will resonate for a long time. Marco Confortola remains depressed and angry, particularly about the death of McDonnell. He must face up to a long and painful recovery from frostbite, as does Wilco van Rooijen. Both men were evacuated by helicopter to hospital in Islamabad. Cecilie Skog flew back to Norway within days of reaching base camp, escaping the media to be with her family. Many questions remain. No version of events has emerged that answers all the contradictions and gaps in the narrative. It is possible, given the confusion generated by exhaustion and hypoxia, it never will. Facts and the memory of them can seem hazy at sea level, let alone among a strung-out group of climbers whose brains are dying. Those who believe high-altitude mountaineering has become a selfish and consumerist travesty of itself will find the facts to fit their theories. But it is worth stating that among the climbers on K2 this year, Rolf Bae was truly gifted, while van Rooijen and Confortola showed incredible stamina. Many climbers and porters fought hard to help each other, at grave risk to their own safety.  Climbers die in the Karakoram every year. But then climbers die on Mont Blanc or in Scotland. Mountain climbing is a dangerous sport, whether practised by saints or sinners. Many climbers, I would guess, would be only too pleased if newspapers listened to the readers of the New York Times and stopped reporting accidents. Nicholas Rice, meanwhile, is thinking about going back. &apos;Maybe not next year. Maybe not the year after. But I can say for sure I&apos;ll come back. It&apos;s always been a dream of mine to be up there.&apos;  K2: Death and the mountain 1953 On one of the earliest expeditions, injured American Art Gilkey is in a makeshift stretcher when he slips from the mountain and disappears. The memorial at base camp to all K2&apos;s dead is named after him. 1986 Alan Rouse becomes the first Briton to conquer K2, on 4 August. He dies six days later, trying to wait out a storm. Thirteen people died on the mountain in this year. 1995 &apos;Summit or die, either way I win,&apos; says Rob Slater before tackling K2. Ominous words: the American and six others, including Briton Alison Hargreaves, are killed in a freak storm. 2004 Seven climbers die from June to August, including three South Koreans, found in a crevice in their sleeping bags, and Manel de la Matta from Spain, who develops appendicitis during his descent as part of a Catalan expedition. 2006 Four Russians die 200 metres from the summit when struck by a &apos;silent&apos; avalanche.", "publicationDate": "2008-08-30T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/31/9", "title": "K2 claimed 11 lives last month.

The political chaos that has engulfed the capital, Bangkok, and regional cities in the past week threatens to unseat the prime minister.  Three major Thai airports - Phuket, Krabi and Hat Yai - were closed for most of the weekend and the state&apos;s rail network paralysed by strikes coordinated by the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (Pad). At the heart of the dispute is the role of Thaksin Shinawatra, the former prime minister who was deposed in a 2006 military coup. Thaksin, now owner of Manchester City football club, fled to Britain to escape an array of corruption charges. The protesters allege that the current coalition government in Bangkok is operating as his political proxy. The movement&apos;s decision to target the wealth-providing tourist industry indicates how much is at stake.  &quot;We closed the airports to tell them we can do this on a much, much bigger scale if they don&apos;t listen to us,&quot; said the alliance&apos;s founder, Sondhi Limthongkul, at the weekend. For several days Phuket and Krabi airports were blockaded and protesters staged sit-ins on runways. As many as 20,000 passengers, many tourists, were prevented from boarding flights home. On Saturday, the protesters released their grip on the southern airport of Hat Yai. Yesterday PAD supporters withdrew from terminals at Phuket and Krabi. Thousands of Britons are believed to have been caught up in the turmoil, which came in the closing days of the summer holiday season. Many were forced to hire taxis for the 10-hour ride north from their hotels direct to Bangkok airport. There were reports of PAD supporters setting up roadblocks on routes into the capital. Alex Reynolds, 53, an exhibitions organiser from Kensington, London, was sitting in O&apos;Tool&apos;s bar in Phuket yesterday hoping the chaos had cleared in time for his flight home. &quot;A lot of people paid 15,000 baht [\u00a3240] to hire taxis to make sure they got their connections in Bangkok,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s been difficult. Protesters were sitting on the runways but they have reopened the airport just in time. People were trying to get us to sign petitions. I didn&apos;t want to get involved. I didn&apos;t expect an [attempted] coup here.&quot;  The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said many package holiday firms paid for tourists to stay extra nights or organised buses back to Bangkok. &quot;It&apos;s been an inconvenience rather than a disaster,&quot; a spokesman said.  The Foreign Office cautioned tourists to &quot;avoid large demonstrations&quot; and the central area of Bangkok. &quot;The situation is changing by the minute,&quot; an official said. More than 800,000 Britons visit Thailand every year. Thailand&apos;s parliament went into emergency session last night trying to resolve the crisis, which has prompted thousands of demonstrators to occupy the compound surrounding the prime minister&apos;s house. The People&apos;s Alliance began the demonstrations last week, demanding the resignation of the prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, and his entire cabinet. Protesters, some wielding golf clubs, stormed national radio stations while others clashed with police. Arrest warrants have been issued against protest leaders but police have been unable to enforce them.

A six-year-old lad puts on his beloved team&apos;s kit, clutches the captain&apos;s hand and walks on to a Premiership pitch as the crowd roars its welcome. He&apos;s ball boy for the afternoon, famous for two minutes in a small, touching ritual you&apos;ve seen a hundred times - the familiar moment when our greatest game seeks to show a soft heart.  And - oh yes! - it cost his dad \u00a3200 cash, up front. Doesn&apos;t the relentless, tatty avarice get you down? We&apos;re repeatedly urged to get angry about sky-high City salaries: which I am, except that the only top earners I know are out of a job at the moment. We&apos;re told to punish the BBC for giving Jonathan Ross \u00a36m a year. But look at Frank Lampard - taking a million or so more than that for every one of the next five years on a fixed, unsackable contract. Look at John Terry, leaving Wossie far behind. Look at Cristiano Ronaldo, openly hankering after Real Madrid&apos;s \u00a3180,000 a week (and limping by on a mere \u00a3119, 000 while he gets his foot fixed). This is the worst recession since Alistair Darling began, our glum chancellor claimed over the weekend. The years of plenty and facile, unrealistic assumptions are over. The crunch has bitten Ally&apos;s legs. But why, pray - how, pray - in a nation supposedly on its knees, with repossessions soaring week by the week and political fortunes plummeting, could 34,000 turn out at Goodison this weekend, paying \u00a330-plus a head, to see an enfeebled Everton walloped by Portsmouth? This is Merseyside, for heaven&apos;s sake, the brokest of the broke. But zip goes another million.  Of course, in theory, it can&apos;t go on. Harry Redknapp at Pompey says he&apos;s all spent out. The squabbling Americans who own Liverpool have put moving from Anfield on hold. Out of the Premier spotlight, the likes of Coventry and Luton scrabble for survival. And yet it does go on. Those Lampard and Terry salaries are new. And just sit down with your calculator at midnight tonight, counting as the transfer window snaps temporarily shut. Who can compete with Tottenham, more than \u00a350m already spent? What am I finally bid for this brooding Berbatov or flamboyant Robinho? Anyone fancy Titian and Veronese to shore up their back four? Liverpool can&apos;t afford Stanley Park, but can somehow manage \u00a312m for another Spanish import? The great transfer game, in short, finds business much as usual - and played out on an ocean of debt. Chelsea had a net borrowing of \u00a3620m as they began last season (on Deloitte figures) and it took a personal loan of \u00a390m from Roman Abramovich to keep them moving on. Liverpool found themselves \u00a356m adrift on the loan front and need that bigger capacity ground to make any financial sense of the next five years. Wages alone at Villa, Everton and Wigan easily exceeded revenue. Manchester City, West Ham and Middlesborough owed \u00a3330m between them. It&apos;s a story to make Northern Rock seem a bastion of prudence by comparison: total profligacy inviting certain retribution. But the whistle never blows. Sometimes - as this season - TV rights come to the temporary rescue. Sometimes, in happier years, a chummy bank manager will do. Often a saviour - Russian oligarchs, Icelandic entrepreneurs, ex-prime ministers of Thailand - will emerge when the going is roughest. The carousel of cash and heedlessness never stops. Wage inflation may not be hitting the 20% level of years just gone by, but it can still make millionaires of pretty ordinary journeymen in the Coca-Cola Championship - and League Two (ie Third Division) cloggers take home twice as much as Gordon Brown. It&apos;s idiotic. It bears no relation to the bad times that wash around us. Crisis, what crisis? Go out and see whether \u00a320m will buy a new striker. Football has become a parallel universe inhabited by excess, groin strains and continuing England international failure. The whole creaking edifice needs a short, sharp shock to make Darling quail. Not Luton&apos;s or Bournemouth&apos;s tiddlers tottering near the brink, but an Enronic apocalypse, a giant bubble burst with a bang. Send Abramovich back to Siberia as Georgia tit for tat? Move Manchester City to south Bangkok? Close Liverpool until its owners get their act together? There has to be a moment when reality finally bites soccer&apos;s legs; when the cost of this three-ring circus bears some relationship to the price of bread.

We were on the last leg of our US holiday and driving around a remote lake called Coeur d&apos;Alene in Idaho. There wasn&apos;t another soul in sight.  I tried to reassure him that everything was going to be all right as I quickly weighed up our options. Should I turn back to the city to get help, or push on in the hope of finding a hospital? His face had turned grey, and he was sweating profusely. I had a sense it was a life-or-death decision, so I took a deep breath and carried on going. Within minutes, Albert was unconscious. I kept one hand on the wheel and the other on his wrist, feeling for his pulse and willing him to stay alive.  Eventually, I found a post office and went inside to get help. The woman behind the desk directed me to a hospital 60 miles away. I knew that Albert wouldn&apos;t make such a long journey, so the woman called for her colleague who had trained in first aid, and he arrived equipped with an oxygen tank. It kept Albert going while we waited for the ambulance.  I insisted again that Albert was in no fit state for a long journey so the driver reluctantly agreed to take him to a much smaller hospital 17 miles away. I followed the rather rickety-looking ambulance in our hire car. The tiny hospital was at the bottom of the lake that we had been driving around. As I ran inside, a tall Native American man stopped me in my tracks. He would be treating Albert. Dark braids ran down the sides of his Hawaiian shirt; he wasn&apos;t wearing scrubs. In all the confusion I wondered whether Albert had been brought to a conventional hospital. The young man obviously sensed my unease.  &quot;Don&apos;t worry, I trained at the Mayo Clinic,&quot; he told me. I had heard of this renowned American medical school and immediately felt reassured. The doctor gave Albert an injection to keep him alive and called for an air ambulance to take him to a much bigger hospital in Idaho&apos;s neighbouring state, Washington. It all felt so surreal, as if I was watching the drama unfold from the outside, rather than being in the centre of it all.  The doctor came outside to talk to me. He told me his name was David Baines and explained the route I needed to take into Washington. For the first time since Albert fell ill my nerves failed me. How was I going to make it there on my own? David was quick to reassure me again.  &quot;You&apos;ve been so very calm so far,&quot; he said. &quot;I know you&apos;re going to be fine.&quot; He was right. I got to the hospital without any trouble. When I arrived, a surgeon explained that Albert needed an emergency double heart bypass operation otherwise he was going to die. It was touch and go whether he would make it. I immediately thought of our 29-year-old adopted son David who was travelling at the time, with his first wife. It was 1989 - long before mobile phones and the internet - and it took two weeks to track David down to Ko Samui, off the coast of Thailand, but he immediately made his way to Bangkok where he caught the next flight to America. Meanwhile, Albert survived the operation, much to the surprise of many of the doctors who had treated him. He came out of hospital five weeks later and our insurance company put us up in a hotel while he recovered enough to make the journey home.  I kept thinking of Dr David Baines back in Idaho. It was his quick thinking that had saved Albert&apos;s life and I wanted to thank him. He was delighted to hear that Albert had pulled through, and I invited him to come and have lunch with us in Washington. The two Davids were around the same age and really hit it off. By the time we left for England, more than three months later, we had all become firm friends with the doctor and invited him to come and stay with us in Warwickshire. David came to visit a year after our return. As we became closer, he opened up about his family history. He explained that his great grandfather had been given the name Baines by an Anglican missionary named William Duncan. Sadly, David had no idea what his family&apos;s Native American name had been  before that, but he remained close to his roots, wearing the traditional clothes and performing the dances. He told us that his childhood had been tough and that he had been brought up by an uncle, which is why he enjoyed spending time with us so much. It was fascinating listening to David talk about his life and he was just as interested in our own story, especially of how we had come to adopt our son. I told him all about how Albert and I had first met our David. Back then we ran several businesses together and didn&apos;t have any children of our own. One year, we decided to give a boy or girl from a nearby children&apos;s home a traditional family Christmas. We were paired up with David who, at four, was the most self-possessed little boy I had ever met. When Christmas was over he started to stay for weekends and soon made it clear that he wanted to stay with us rather than go back to the home. Despite never planning to have a family, we fostered him full-time before eventually adopting him. It was the 60s, and in those days it was considered an unusual step because David was mixed race and it was obvious that he wasn&apos;t our natural son. We had endured our fair share of prejudice about it and, being from a minority, this was something David Baines could identify with.  On the last day of his visit, we all got up early before David left for Heathrow. I was in the kitchen when he came to talk to me.  &quot;Can I ask you something, Maureen?&quot; he said, sounding very serious. &quot;Will you adopt me?&quot; At first I thought David must be joking. After all, he was in his 30s, hardly a child. But as he explained, I realised what he meant. He wanted us to bring him into our life, just as we had brought in our David all those years before. We had become very close during his stay and I knew his difficult childhood had probably inspired this rather unusual request. It didn&apos;t even enter my head to turn him down. After all, he had saved Albert&apos;s life. It was the least we could do. &quot;Albert and I will &apos;adopt&apos; you - in inverted commas,&quot; I told him. &quot;From now on you&apos;ll always be considered a member of the family and we&apos;ll always be there for you.&quot; Over the years since then, Albert and I have come to think of David as our second son. As his career developed, he was often sent to the UK for conferences and he would always come to see us. When he married and had a family of his own, he made sure they became part of ours, too. He even sends me Mother&apos;s Day cards. I know our situation might seem a bit odd to some, but our friends and family have always accepted it. I think it&apos;s because we&apos;ve never been what you would call a conventional family. I grew up in Lancashire during the second world war and my own parents often took in children who had been evacuated from the cities during the bombings. We made them feel part of the family, so I&apos;ve always known that you don&apos;t have to be related by blood to consider someone as kin. Even as a child I remember telling my mother that I would adopt children rather than have my own. It&apos;s almost 20 years now since David came into our lives and I am now a proud grandmother to four children. My first adopted David has five-year-old twins, Amelie and Finley, while my second has Cooper, five, and Alexander, two.  Meanwhile, the grandchildren have inspired me to take up writing. Three years ago I was diagnosed with cancer, and during my stay in hospital I started writing children&apos;s stories using all my grandchildren as characters. When I was well again, I got them made up into a book called Granny&apos;s Bedtimes stories, which I now sell on behalf of various charities. So far I&apos;ve managed to raise nearly \u00a320,000.  Two years ago the entire family was brought together for our 50th wedding anniversary. It made me think about how much I owe David Baines. Albert is 85 now and I am 75. He gave us so many more years of life together.  They say that you can&apos;t chose your family but my two Davids chose theirs, and I feel tremendously proud of that. \u00b7 Maureen Morgan was speaking to Danielle Wrate.

Writing about Paul Gadd (alias Gary Glitter), recently released from a Vietnamese jail where he served nearly three years for sexual offences against girls of 10 and 11, the Daily Mail columnist Amanda Platell demanded: &quot;Who gave this reptilian exhibitionist the oxygen of publicity? Who propelled him to world notoriety and made his claims for state protection legitimate?&quot; Well, let&apos;s a hazard few guesses. Could it be the Sun&apos;s Virginia Wheeler who got to sit next to Gadd on a flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Bangkok and reported how she &quot;shuddered&quot; as he &quot;stroked my arm and called me &apos;sweetie&apos;&quot;? Or some of the 20 or so other hacks on the flight? Or the Mirror which revealed how he &quot;shamelessly acted the prima donna by signing autographs&quot; on the flight? Could it even be the Mail itself which pictured Gadd on the front page, alongside the Olympic winner Christine Ohuruogu under the headline &quot;Best of British, Worst of British&quot;? None of these. According to Platell, the guilty party was the home secretary Jacqui Smith who announced, as Gadd left Vietnam, that she wanted to stop convicted paedophiles travelling abroad - which was exactly what a Sun leader demanded the same morning. This was &quot;sickening opportunism&quot; and &quot;high-profile paedo-bashing&quot; which &quot;helped whip up&quot; a &quot;frenzy&quot; that will mean taxpayers have to pay to protect him, said Platell. No doubt it was Smith who provoked the Sun into putting Gadd on its front page five times in the past two weeks; the Mail into tracking down a son he left in Cuba after an eight-year affair; the News of the World into interviewing - with their faces fully exposed in a two-column picture - the two Vietnamese girls he molested. As John Junor used to say, &quot;pass the sickbag, Alice&quot;. Last week, the Sun, whose editor Rebekah Wade is said to be passionate about protecting children, devoted considerable resources to tracking Gadd&apos;s whereabouts on his return to the UK. It found him in Hampshire and pictured him disguised by &quot;an absurd ginger wig and straw hat&quot;. The headline was &quot;You can run but you can&apos;t hide.&quot; Wade would argue her paper was performing a service by informing the local community of Gadd&apos;s presence - &quot;disturbingly, kids&apos; toys litter the front lawn. . . next door&quot; - and stopping him molesting more children while living incognito. But the disguise is made necessary by the hatred created by media coverage, which threatens mob violence and even murder - and surely makes it more likely that Gadd will eventually move somewhere the Sun can&apos;t find him, adopt an effective disguise and thus get more opportunities to attack children, possibly overseas.  That leaves two solutions: either Gadd - who has been found guilty only of downloading child pornography under British law - is locked up for life, or he is left to the mercy of what the Telegraph columnist Simon Heffer calls &quot;most rational people [who] would find it quite acceptable if he were to be taken out and shot in the back of the head&quot;. But &quot;pervs&quot; will always be a subject of redtop fascination. This applies particularly to those, such as Gadd, who have fallen from the pinnacle of success. As Sam Warner, a psychologist, suggested in the Independent on Sunday, Gadd embodies elemental public fears about paedophiles who worm their way into our lives, behaving oddly but quite lovably, while secretly planning to damage our children. In his 1970s heyday, Gary Glitter was hugely popular with under-16s while being regarded by anybody older (and more sophisticated children) as a bit of a laugh, if a harmless one. The press colluded in creating that image. In 1973, for example, the Sun interviewed &quot;the rock &apos;n&apos; roll Daddy who makes little girls ask to see more of his hairy chest&quot;, a wish the paper happily granted with a picture. The Sun added, innocently (well, if it wasn&apos;t innocent, it&apos;s a scandal): &quot;Gary Glitter thinks a lot about kids.&quot; In the same year, the Mail&apos;s Roderick Gilchrist was sold a tale about a &quot;wild man of rock&quot; who, in &quot;real&quot; life, discussed Marx and Lenin, played Beethoven&apos;s violin concerto (&quot;it has humour and tenderness&quot;, Glitter confided) and went fishing in the country. The headline, again presumably innocent, was &quot;When a pop star stops rocking, you&apos;d be surprised at what he gets up to&quot;. Glitter was even interviewed in 1977 by the Express&apos;s Jean Rook, then known as &quot;the first lady of Fleet Street&quot;. She found him &quot;astonishingly modest and gentle&quot;. Reading it all now sends shivers down the spine - but it was a standard example of the PR fluff fed to the press, then as now, about most celebrities. No wonder newspapers sound as if they have been almost personally violated. Moreover, &quot;pervs&quot; play an important role in defining the boundary between the respectable folk who read and produce redtop papers and what sociologists call &quot;the other&quot;. The Sun may publish revealing pictures of women just above the age of consent, as well as of flat-chested models, sometimes dressed as young schoolgirls. Anybody who objects is roundly denounced as &quot;politically correct&quot;. But to assure us they are not encouraging paedophilia, the redtops must denounce, even more vehemently, anybody who lays a finger on anyone aged 15 years 364 days or less. This explains why Glitter&apos;s name can never appear without being shepherded by such words as brute, evil, foul, depraved, monster, scum and, specially brought out by the Sun&apos;s Lorraine Kelly for the occasion,&quot;toxic effluent&quot;. Because nobody wants to be accused of even a smidgen of sympathy for paedophiles, it is hard, from what we are told of his misdemeanours, to defend Gadd or argue that people like him deserve human rights.  Since I never liked the look (still less the music) of Glitter anyway, I&apos;m not even going to try. But popular hatred, once aroused, can be hard to control. The Sun implicitly invited readers to look out for Gadd, asking for pictures of him &quot;out and about&quot;. The false sightings could exceed those of Madeleine McCann. Let us hope that one of Heffer&apos;s &quot;rational people&quot; doesn&apos;t get the wrong person. Subs are the future After 15 years, it seems the newspaper price war, in the quality market at least, is over. By raising the Times cover price to 80p, Rupert Murdoch has brought it back into line with its rivals. The surprising thing is it has taken him so long. The price cut gave the Times a dramatic boost, moving its circulation ahead of the Guardian and Independent, but never, as Murdoch hoped, threatening the Telegraph. That paper kept sales buoyant with a heavily-discounted subscription scheme, binding readers of the daily paper into taking the weaker Sunday as well.  Now Murdoch has followed with his own seven-day, voucher-based subscription scheme, more flexible than the Telegraph&apos;s, which doesn&apos;t give you a voucher you can use at different newsagents. Readers pay \u00a35.50 a week for the two papers, instead of \u00a36.90. He has also copied the Independent&apos;s offer of free home deliveries.

As thousands of demonstrators remained in the main government compound in Bangkok this morning, a small bomb exploded in a police booth in the city. The blast damaged windows, but caused no injuries.  This development prompted a senior government source to claim that the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD) campaigners were taking protests to another level. &quot;The PAD has launched a guerrilla war,&quot; the source said. &quot;They want to show that the government and the police are too weak to protect the people,&quot; the national police spokesman Surapol Thuanthong told Reuters. &quot;It is something we expected.&quot; But General Jongrak Jutanond, who was named Bangkok&apos;s new police chief today after his predecessor was sidelined, repeated the government&apos;s line about police restraint. &quot;We have enough reinforcements to prevent violence and to disperse protesters. Police will not harm the protesters.&quot; A PAD spokesman denied any responsibility for the bombing. &quot;We had no reason to do that. It would only scare away protesters, not bring more people to join. We have other effective civil disobedience measures to fight the government without planting a bomb,&quot; Parnthep Pourpongpan said. The PAD, a group of conservative businessmen and activists whose campaign against the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra led to his overthrow in a 2006 coup, has always espoused peaceful protest, although last week men used knives and clubs to storm the state television centre.  The protests are the climax of a campaign calling for the resignation of the prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, who is accused of being an illegitimate proxy for Thaksin and his perceived corrupt regime. Thaksin, who owns Manchester City football club, is in exile in London.  Trade union support for the protesters continues to grow, with railway, water and power workers taking part. Hundreds of employees of the State Railways of Thailand continued a strike that has halted service on dozens of train lines, cutting off most long-distance connections between Bangkok and the far northern and southern parts of the country.  Somchai Srinewest, the head of the union at Thailand&apos;s Waterworks Authority, said: &quot;The tap water at the national police headquarters and at provincial administration offices will be cut off starting Monday.&quot; Sirichai Maingam, the union leader at the state power producer Egat, urged back-room staff to take a holiday but said production workers would carry on as normal. &quot;We are not going to hurt the people as our strike aim is to slow down the government&apos;s work,&quot; he said. In one positive development, there was temporary relief for thousands of tourists stranded in the country. Airport blockades were lifted on Sunday at Phuket and Krabi, two of Thailand&apos;s popular beach destinations.  In his weekly radio address on Sunday, Samak repeated that his patience was wearing out. &quot;I am not afraid but I am concerned about chaos in the nation,&quot; he said. &quot;We cannot let the seizure of Government House continue indefinitely without taking action.&quot; During an emergency debate in parliament he accused protesters of wanting to destroy democracy. &quot; I love this country as much as anybody. But I love democracy much more, more than anyone who told me to resign. &quot;I will not resign or dissolve parliament. I will not be defeated by those protesters,&quot; he said.", "publicationDate": "2008-09-01T10:54:58Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/01/thailand1", "title": "Bomb targets police in Thai protests", "sentences": ["As thousands of demonstrators remained in the main government compound in Bangkok this morning, a small bomb exploded in a police booth in the city.", "&quot;It is something we expected.&quot; But General Jongrak Jutanond, who was named Bangkok&apos;s new police chief today after his predecessor was sidelined, repeated the government&apos;s line about police restraint.", "Hundreds of employees of the State Railways of Thailand continued a strike that has halted service on dozens of train lines, cutting off most long-distance connections between Bangkok and the far northern and southern parts of the country."]}, {"article": "Another Premier League season, another little heard of Arab takeover looms into view. In echoes of the protracted love triangle between Tom Hicks, George Gillette and DIC over the ownership and future of Liverpool, another rich consortium on the banks of the Persian Gulf has dipped its toe into the waters of Premiership club ownership. This time, though, the Abu Dhabi United Group for Investment and Development [Adug], has met with markedly less resistance. Thaksin Shinawatra, the controversial ex-PM of Thailand who has been at Manchester City&apos;s helm for little more than a year, clearly thought it in the best interests of his club to step aside. With $3bn worth of assets still frozen by the Thai government, anti-Thaksin protests crippling Bangkok and a member of the Man City board having to throw in the odd \u00a32m loan to make sure the tea lady got her wages on time, it was clear his financial muscle had been curtailed. This is not a problem that Adug is ever likely to experience if, as expected, Man City&apos;s accounts are in order and it takes control of the club in two weeks time. But what do we know about the new owners? Initially, it appeared that the bid came from an offshoot of Abu Dhabi&apos;s huge sovereign investment fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. The United Arab Emirates is made up of seven small emirates, each run by its own absolute monarch. But Abu Dhabi is the biggest and most powerful of the seven, bigger even than Dubai. It is the seat of power, the nation&apos;s capital and also the emirate where almost all of the country&apos;s vast oil reserves, estimated at almost 10% of known oil worldwide, resides. It is thought that the Emir, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahyan, owns the richest sovereign fund in the world. Yet the Adug consortium has initially denied that the deal is connected to the government. According to Sulaiman Al Fahim, who brokered the deal and sits on Adug&apos;s board, it is merely a group of &quot;prestigious businessmen&quot;. But in a society where patronage and royal decree are the driving forces behind business success, those closer to the deal suspect differently. &quot;This is all the Abu Dhabi royal family,&quot; explained Anil Bhoyrul, the former Mirror journalist who broke the story for his Dubai-based magazine Arabian Business. &quot;This [Adug] is essentially an investment vehicle set up for Man City and funded by sheikhs in the royal family. It&apos;s not exactly clear which sheikhs it is yet but this is the Abu Dhabi royal family.&quot; It is no surprise either that the deal has followed on the heels of DIC&apos;s attempts to buy Liverpool. Since the country&apos;s creation in 1971 \u2013 a move driven by Sheikh Khalifa&apos;s father, the revered late Sheikh Zayed \u2013 Dubai and Abu Dhabi have competed against each other for the world&apos;s affections, a rivalry that has gone into overdrive since the turn of the century. When Dubai built its own seven-star hotel, the Burj Al Arab, Abu Dhabi responded with its own, the Emirates Palace. When Dubai embarked on huge, glamorous construction projects that stole headlines across the world, Abu Dhabi followed suit with plans to build a Guggenheim and a Louvre. Even sporting events have witnessed this economic one-upmanship, with Abu Dhabi setting up a rival to Dubai&apos;s PGA tour golf event and tennis tournament.From the outside, it appeared that Abu Dhabi resented the success of its glamorous neighbour. Dubai&apos;s royal family had been so successful in branding the emirate that many assumed that it, and not Abu Dhabi, was the capital of the UAE. So when DIC, itself an investment arm of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum&apos;s sovereign fund, tried and failed to buy a Premier League club, Abu Dhabi just had to keep up with the Joneses. Well, the Maktoums. &quot;DIC was actually looking at Man City, and then the Abu Dhabi people came in,&quot; explains Bhoyrul. &quot;Apparently they were told by Man City that they couldn&apos;t deal with them at first as they were already dealing with someone from Dubai! But that changed when they explained they were from Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi is competing with Dubai to be a global player. There is a huge rivalry between the two.&quot; Man City fans have already come to terms with the fast-paced life of being a petrodollar plaything: a top-four finish this season has been promised with Champions League football to follow. And if Dimitar Berbatov&apos;s move goes through before the deadline it will represent only the start of a huge recruitment drive. Already a list of six players has been drawn up to be targeted in the January transfer window. The list, Bhoyrul says, will &quot;make Berbatov&apos;s signing pale in comparison&quot;. Of course, rich sugar daddies have come in before with their smooth moves, making grand promises and wooing us with some intoxicated lovelorn chat only to sneak out in the morning with the family silver while we&apos;re still sleeping. But there are signs that this investment has a stronger footing than, say, Hicks and Gillette&apos;s investment in Liverpool. The aim of any business is to turn a profit, but there are far more important forces at work. The motivation here has a tinge of nationalism. Buying Man City is as much about putting Abu Dhabi&apos;s flag in the sand. The emirate wants to be a global sports hub, and there&apos;s no better way of fast-tracking that than buying one of the grande dames of English football. It is also ample evidence that the world&apos;s financial power base is shifting eastwards. But more importantly than that, the capture of Man City gets one over on Abu Dhabi&apos;s glamorous neighbours over their Eastern border. And that, they will conclude, is worth any price.

Thailand declared a state of emergency early today after the worst violence since an anti-government campaign began in May. Up to 400 soldiers were drafted in to help police the area around Government House, which protesters have occupied for a week. The violence erupted as 500 Samak supporters - some carrying sticks and wearing helmets - tried to remove the opposition People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy from the government compound. Police and anti-government activists stopped them and fighting between the two sides ensued.  The clashes took place after state workers, acting in solidarity with anti-government demonstrators, threatened to cut off water, electricity and phone services at government offices and disrupt flights of the national airline from tomorrow. A coalition of 43 unions representing state workers said the move was justified because the government had beaten protesters. The alliance claims the government is corrupt and too close to the former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 military coup and recently fled to Britain to escape corruption charges. The same group organized the massive anti-Thaksin protests in 2006 that helped spark a bloodless coup. Protesters say that western-style democracy gives too much weight to Thailand&apos;s rural majority, who protesters say are susceptible to vote buying that breeds corruption.

The bookmakers seem confident enough, quoting odds of 1-4. They may have to reassess if Fabio Capello&apos;s side lose to Croatia next week, regardless of the scoreline against mighty Andorra this Saturday. Either way Capello&apos;s honeymoon period is over. We are about to discover whether the latest shipment of expensive imported coaching brains can make the slightest difference.  If only it were as simple as, say, hiring Jamie Oliver to bring a touch of Italian freshness to the lumpen diet which, with the odd brief exception, has been English football&apos;s staple since 1966. A metaphorical sundried tomato here, a dash of extra virgin olive oil there and we would be queuing around the block. Instead Signor Capello finds himself confronted with the equivalent of two tins of spaghetti hoops and a few stale breadsticks. As yet there have been no reports of parents slipping burgers through the perimeter fence at training sessions but give it a month or two. Luckily Capello already seems braced for the messy collision between national expectancy and the reality - that England have been stuck in an under-performing rut for a decade. &quot;I know if we win I will be the best and if I lose I am the stupid man,&quot; he confirmed, pausing only to omit Michael Owen and pick the world-famous Jimmy Bullard. More worryingly, he is already complaining about a lack of time with his players. Did he not study the Premier League fixture list before accepting the job? It seems we are condemned to another weary cycle of cultural cringing and all-too-familiar tears. The reason, of course, is that the mainstream of English football remains stubbornly out of kilter with the rest of the world, which is not exactly Capello&apos;s fault. Nor have enough people been brave enough to criticise the mass influx of non-qualified players into the Premier League which has left Capello desperately seeking any fit midfielder who can hum God Save the Queen. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has been at Arsenal for 12 years and has groomed only Ashley Cole to be an England regular. It makes the job of international coach virtually untenable. No wonder certain players have the look of men who know they&apos;re making the best of a bad job. Personally, I fear Capello has his work cut out. Five friendlies have provided little succour and if England play dull, low-scoring football for the next 12 months, his tenure will be as far removed from la dolce vita as is humanly possible on an annual salary of \u00a36m. The published extracts from Gabriele Marcotti&apos;s new book Capello: Portrait of a Winner do not suggest a man who exhibits patience in the face of criticism. It is not hard to imagine Joe Dolce&apos;s Shaddap You Face becoming the soundtrack to his press conferences. And if it does all go avocado pear-shaped, it will again fuel the argument as to whether any imported European club coach can possibly bring the snarling three lions to heel. Some will cite Kevin Pietersen&apos;s recent contribution to English cricket but he has done it by deed and example, not man-management. Outsider coaches have succeeded in cricket, rugby, cycling and rowing but English international football remains stubbornly immune. Peter Reid&apos;s appointment as Thailand&apos;s manager is an hilarious case study in reverse, surely a triumph of wishful thinking over common sense. Thai supporters must be thrilled that their new messiah&apos;s first outing in riot-torn Bangkok was to a karaoke club where he sang &quot;You&apos;re just too good to be true&quot; without, apparently, a hint of irony. &quot;The one thing you do notice is the heat,&quot; Reid said.  Blimey, who would have thought it? Capello also faces a steep learning curve with no guarantee of a happy ending in Zagreb, Minsk, Almaty and Kiev. Absolutely Fabiolous? Not necessarily. Jonah Ecclestone puts foot in his motormouth  Those of us lucky enough to be in Beijing have all come home saying the same thing: London has to do it differently in 2012 or risk uncomfortable comparisons. The &quot;Party Games&quot; has a certain ring to it, with round-the-clock fun to distract visitors from pesky little details like endless traffic jams, teeming rain and budgetary black holes. If any member of the IOC family needs entertaining, a hastily-arranged night out with Pete Doherty should do the trick. What a letdown, then, to hear that nice, cuddly Bernie Ecclestone is advising everyone to abandon all hope now. All credit to the admirable Jim Rosenthal for supplying the interviewer&apos;s rope but Bernie&apos;s recipe for salvaging London&apos;s pride - &quot;They&apos;d better pray there&apos;s going to be an earthquake so it doesn&apos;t happen&quot; - has installed him as the killjoy&apos;s killjoy for the foreseeable future. How they must be smiling, too, in the quake-hit region of Sichuan province where almost 70,000 people died in May and a further 27 perished at the weekend courtesy of another tremor. Ecclestone also went on to suggest - I&apos;m paraphrasing slightly here - that Britain&apos;s sporting leaders would struggle to stage a small village fete. Bovver-boy Bernie&apos;s potshot at Usain Bolt&apos;s 2012 hosts may yet prove accurate, of course. But how depressing that someone so intimately acquainted with the sharp end of international sporting affairs should instinctively dismiss London&apos;s charms. If I were Lord Coe, I&apos;d pin the quote up on the office wall for hourly motivation. Moose-slaying makes Palin an elk of a running mate Journalists love to indulge in pithy shorthand and John McCain&apos;s Republican running mate, Sarah Palin (&quot;a 44-year-old moose-hunting mother of five&quot; - The Times), is perfect raw material. Even the most cursory study of moose-related websites, though, elevates the governor of Alaska into the Premier League of sporty politicians. In Norway three years ago two moose took on a dogsled being pulled by 12 huskies, 24 hours after another moose had broken into a children&apos;s clothing shop in Lillehammer. Hunting such militant big beasts is by no means a walk in the tundra and Mrs Palin&apos;s other favourite sport - riding a snowmobile with hubby Todd - also sets her somewhat apart from the country club golf set. Nor is her decision to name her eldest child Track - whatever happened to twin sister Field? - the act of a natural couch potato. All the Republicans need now is a loose moose in the White House and Obama is toast. Wildcard squabble was all mouth and trousers It was hard not to be entertained by the wonderful hissy fit involving Colin Montgomerie and Ian Poulter before the Ryder Cup team announcement. &quot;Self-praise is no praise,&quot; muttered Monty, implying Poulter had been talking himself up without proper foundation. Faldo&apos;s subsequent wildcard selection of Poulter and Paul Casey doubtless caused as much joy in Montgomerie-shire as the click of a camera shutter halfway down his backswing. Faldo, of course, had no option but to leave at least one of the combatants behind for the sake of team unity. What a shame. If anything was guaranteed to unnerve Europe&apos;s opponents it would be the sight of a perspiring Monty squeezing into a pair of Poulter&apos;s trousers.", "publicationDate": "2008-09-01T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["England", "Sport", "Football", "Fabio Capello"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/02/englandfootballteam", "title": "Football: Fabio Capello cannot succeed when the game is immune to the cure", "sentences": ["Thai supporters must be thrilled that their new messiah&apos;s first outing in riot-torn Bangkok was to a karaoke club where he sang &quot;You&apos;re just too good to be true&quot; without, apparently, a hint of irony."]}, {"article": "     Is there a single cinematic hitman who doesn&apos;t have a conscience? For a supposedly ruthless profession their blood does run pretty milky in the movies. John Cusack&apos;s Martin Blank would rather go gooey over Minnie Driver than cause carnage in Grosse Point. Jason Bourne is as interested in finding himself as your average Goan hippy and even Agent blooming 47, out of a film actually called Hitman, is distracted from his true calling by the love of a good Russian. So the question has to be asked as to whether &quot;Joe&quot;, as played by Nicolas Cage in the remake of the Pang Brothers&apos; 1999 success Bangkok Dangerous, is about to redress the balance. Will he put finally put a touch of dehumanised sadist back into the killer for hire?     Some kind of Nighthawk    0.10: The initial signs are good. Joe, just Joe thank you very much, is sat alone in a diner late on, like some kind of Nighthawk. He is gazing into the distance, contemplating the futility of human existence. We presume. &quot;My job takes me to a lot of places,&quot; Joe intones. &quot;The work is steady, the money&apos;s good, but it&apos;s not for everyone.&quot; Why&apos;s that then? Oh. Is it because you sometimes have to leave what you&apos;re doing and, from the top of a tall building, shoot a man dead in the head? That&apos;s it, isn&apos;t it. 0.19: &quot;My name is Joe ... This is what I do.&quot; Yes, that seems clear now.     We're in the Far East!    0.21: A flash of studio ident and the roar of a jumbo jet signify a jump in the storyline. Joe, it seems, is flying abroad \u2013 probably on a job of killing \u2013 but where precisely is he going? &quot;Purposs of your bizit to Bangkok, Mr Lincent?&quot; &quot;Holiday.&quot; Ah, thanks, helpful customs official! Your inability to say the letter V has clued us right up. We&apos;re in the Far East! 0.26:Now we are treated to a montage. This is to confirm, if there had been any doubt, that this film is called Bangkok Dangerous for a reason. First we see a shot of an alluring, mysterious Asian woman (or young man - we&apos;re not prejudicial here); then Joe awkwardly attempting tai chi; and, finally, some kick-boxing. We are in Thailand. 0.34: After a motorbike-based murder that proves once and for all that Joe was not telling the whole truth to the customs official, we are once again in the company of a Thai national with stereotypically poor English. He is setting Joe up with his next target, whom he describes thusly: &quot;This guy, he fight bad guys, and helps the poor.&quot; Cue picture of dignitary waving to crowd from seat of convertible like a chubby, Asian JFK. All the while, Joe&apos;s eyes are widening. He&apos;s realising, with wearisome predictability, that he&apos;s not a cold-blooded killing machine. No, he&apos;s a man, with a conscience. Damn.     The highly predictable bit    0.40: What follows now is typical; Joe tells his paymasters he&apos;s not happy - &quot;Political assassination wasn&apos;t part of the contract&quot; \u2013 and lots of shooting, blowing up and nervous looks over the shoulder ensue. At one point Joe constructs a home-made bomb, throws it down some stairs and then hides from the shrapnel in a bath. It&apos;s improvisation like that which has taken Joe to the top of his profession. 0.55: The explosions continue as Joe reveals his four rules for a successful career in assassination: 1. Don&apos;t ask questions;2. There is no right and wrong;3. Don&apos;t take an interest in people outside of work (oops!);4. Know when to get out and walk away rich.     Oops    The word &quot;oops&quot; is appended to rule number 3 because Joe&apos;s voiceover is spliced with an image of him sitting alone with a beautiful young woman and looking a little soppy. Unless Joe is trying to lure her into a false sense of security before poisoning her with rare mushrooms, it appears rule 3 has been compromised. 1.05: &quot;Nothing is deadlier than a hit man who hits back&quot;, reads the tagline, slightly less than convincingly. What about a hitman who isn&apos;t compromised by conscience in the first place? Surely they&apos;re more dangerous? Or a 50 foot-high lizard that breathes fire?     Snazzy action sequences    1.12: No answers are proffered, but we do get some snazzy, slow-mo, stylised action sequences, in order to remind us that this is an Asian action movie, remade by the Pang brothers themselves. One of the brothers calls himself Oxide Pang Chun. His mother must be proud. 1.25: &quot;Well what is your work?&quot; asks an old lady, who is actually quite good with her Rs. &quot;Banking&quot; replies Joe, with an earnest smile. That&apos;s the second time in a minute he&apos;s done the ironic What&apos;s My Line routine. If you extrapolate that to 90 minutes, we&apos;ll have 180 inaccurate job descriptions. &quot;And why are you here at this top secret mafia hideout?&quot; &quot;I&apos;m selling buildings insurance&quot; 1.35: The trailer comes to an end in a fury of late-90s electronica (a bit like Chemical Brothers circa Dig Your Own Hole, music fans) and an original, if bizarre, piece of CGI wizardry: namely a shot that pursues a bullet all the way from a rifle into the skull of our AJFK. It moves fast and the rendering of the scene is convincing. The only thing that&apos;s odd is the trajectory of the bullet, which seems to wobble up and down like a new ride at Alton Towers (The Assassin&apos;s Bullet).

Samak empowered the army to restore order on the streets of Bangkok following the fighting, the worst violence seen since the anti-government campaign began in May. The dramatic turn came after 400 troops in riot gear were deployed to separate the mobs brandishing clubs and sticks as they fought a brief pitched battle on the broad avenue that runs outside the regional headquarters of the United Nations. A number of shots were fired by several of the protesters armed with pistols in an escalation in the scale of the violence. In the swirling turmoil of Thai politics, the prime minister was also faced with the prospect of his eight-month old coalition being dissolved after the Election Commission recommended today that the supreme court disband his ruling People Power party for electoral fraud. However, the decision will take months to play out. Earlier Samak declared the emergency rule in morning broadcasts branding it the &quot;softest means possible&quot;, though he gave no timescale except to say that it would be over relatively quickly. In the televised news conference Samak said that he had hoped to avoid emergency rule, but the rising violence that left one dead and 34 injured - two from gunshot wounds - had forced his hand. &quot;No one has the right to do such a thing as they have done,&quot; he said. &quot;I had no other choice but to declare a state of emergency in Bangkok in order to solve the problem once and or all.&quot; Samak gave the army&apos;s commander in chief, Anupong Paojinda, sole responsibility for enforcing the emergency rule in the capital, saying troops would assist the police in maintaining calm.

Photograph: Murdo Macleod Chances are you haven&apos;t come across the Lady Boys of Bangkok in the arts pages of national newspapers. But the show was one of the big sellers at the Edinburgh Fringe, and has been for years. Back in May it was also a hit at the Brighton Festival Fringe, where it&apos;s also a regular visitor. And those are just two stops on its nationwide tour that lasts until Christmas. By chance, the Lady Boys were my introduction to Edinburgh. My colleague Clifford Bishop (whom I call Culture Boy), writing for the Independent on Sunday, had already been at the festival for a week, by which time he&apos;d had enough of dance and physical theatre and needed a break. &quot;I got tickets to the Lady Boys of Bangkok,&quot; he said. &quot;Want one?&quot; And so I found myself watching a troupe of &quot;kathoeys&quot; (male-to-female transsexuals/transvestites) lip-synching to hits from Bassey to Beyonc\u00e9 and beyond. The Lady Boys were accompanied by Gent Boys who also got their own spots with such outr\u00e9 macho turns as Bat Out of Hell, Relight My Fire and YMCA. One number showed a Lady Boy turning into a Gent Boy; another featured a character who was half Lady, half Gent. One Lady Boy was certainly no lady, nor indeed gent, but rather a big bruiser in heavy slap who did a mean Tina Turner. What surprised me most was not the show but the audience: overwhelmingly women. Mostly they were in big, intergenerational hen-party style gangs, and I pegged the few men as mostly husbands and boyfriends. But basically, the Lady Boys pull in the ladies. (And, I should add, the locals. Though not, I think, the lesbians). I am neither lady nor local, and was struggling to understand the show&apos;s X-factor. It&apos;s not a drag act, nor is it panto. It&apos;s quite karaoke, and has more than a touch of circus/freakshow (Exhibit A: the midget who humps a Lady Boy leg). So, what was its particularly feminine appeal? You may have other answers, but here&apos;s what I came up with. For women, it&apos;s risqu\u00e9, but not risky: they are almost completely outside this particular web of identification and objectification. The &quot;women&quot; on stage aren&apos;t actual women, and so provide neither competition nor identification nor aspiration. The men on stage are &quot;playing&quot; men (and, I&apos;m guessing, are mostly gay), so there&apos;s no danger that the women&apos;s gaze will be returned (Exhibit A: the YMCA number). The gendered safety zones are made even clearer during the audience participation. Occasionally a Lady Boy would go into the audience to single out a man (Culture Boy got a smacker from Ms Turner); sometimes that man would be brought on stage to become an object of fun/innuendo/humiliation (made to take off his shirt and dance, for example). But when the women came up, it was in groups who joined in the singing (YMCA, again); they were invited to be one of the girls, in on the act. As the show ended I turned to a grinning Culture Boy and said, &quot;You&apos;re very heterosexual - but not very straight&quot; (he was well chuffed). Then I looked around at the exuberantly swaying women - and their somewhat cowed menfolk - cheering the outlandish spectacle of gender-bending impersonation and lipo-sucked lip-synchery and I thought no, it&apos;s more than that ... heterosexuality itself is not very straight.", "publicationDate": "2008-09-02T10:00:00Z", "tags": ["Edinburgh festival 2008", "Dance", "Stage", "Culture", "Edinburgh festival"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/theatreblog/2008/sep/02/ladyboysofbangkok", "title": "Do the Lady Boys of Bangkok light your fire?", "sentences": ["Bangkok dangerous ... the Lady Boys getting ready for a show at the Edinburgh festival.", "Photograph: Murdo Macleod Chances are you haven&apos;t come across the Lady Boys of Bangkok in the arts pages of national newspapers.", "&quot;I got tickets to the Lady Boys of Bangkok,&quot; he said."]}, {"article": "     Thailand&apos;s army chief said today he would refrain from using force to break up anti-government protests, despite the state of emergency declared hours after one demonstrator was killed and dozens injured in violent clashes.

But even after Samak said the state of emergency would last only a &quot;few days&quot; there seemed no easy way out of the crisis with the prime minister and his government refusing to step down and the army allied to Thailand&apos;s revered king showing little inclination to evict the entrenched anti-government protesters. Samak acted swiftly to declare the state of emergency in an early morning broadcast within a few hours of the violence that left one 55-year-old man dead - reportedly beaten to death with golf clubs - and 43 injured. &quot;I did it to solve the problems of the country,&quot; said Samak. &quot;I had no other choice.

The prospect of Thailand&apos;s army returning to the streets evoked memories of the military coup two years ago that removed Samak&apos;s predecessor and ally, Thaksin Shinawatra, who fled to the UK last month to avoid corruption charges. But Gen Anupong, who held his own briefing shortly after the prime minister, ridiculed suggestions that the army was preparing to grab power yet again. He said if troops were deployed to curb violence they would only be armed with shields and batons.  &quot;If we thought we could use police and soldiers to get them out with a peaceful conclusion, we would do it,&quot; he said. &quot;But we think that would create more problems.&quot; Inside the Government House compound occupied a week ago, thousands of Peoples Alliance for Democracy (Pad) demonstrators - clad in yellow shirts to show allegiance to the king - had secured the gates with steel hawser, and helmets, makeshift riot shields and golf clubs lay in piles to repel any attempt to remove them. Outside, barricades of tyres and razor-wire ringed the approach roads. Helmeted sentries armed with sharpened pipes and clubs manned the entrances as others passed out golf clubs, the &quot;3 wood&quot; apparently the weapon of choice. &quot;We will stay and fight,&quot; protest leader Chamlong Srimuang urged the thousands-strong throng. &quot;Stay calm. Don&apos;t fear ... Can you be brave a little longer to save our country?&quot; But the anti-government protesters have less to fear from the army than their opponents in the Democratic Alliance against Dictatorship, camped just half a mile away. It was they, clad in red shirts, who played a cat-and-mouse game with police before breaching their lines in the early hours of yesterday to clash with the Pad protesters manning their barricades to repel the security forces. Middle-aged Pad stalwarts were adamant their opponents were paid by agents of the government to provoke violence to give Samak the excuse to declare emergency rule, in the hope of evicting them and ending the stalemate. &quot;I&apos;m a manager at a factory in Samut Sakhon,&quot; said Pad protester Nat Rantphrakul, 55. &quot;Some of my workers were paid 1,000 baht [\u00a315] each to come to Bangkok.

Pressure had been building for more than three months, as yellow-shirted protesters styling themselves as the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy appropriated royalist colours and nationalist language to oppose the government of prime minister Samak Sundaravej and his People Power Party (PPP). Late last year, Samak proclaimed himself a nominee of the party&apos;s mentor and financier, the former PM and now ex-Manchester City owner Thaksin Shinawatra. Although he was ousted in a military coup in 2006, Thaksin&apos;s five-year premiership has cast a long shadow over Thai politics. As the first recent PM to threaten the symbolic dominance of the monarchy, he remains a controversial figure. He was supported initially by two main groups: elements of the middle class and the business community, many of Sino-Thai descent; and rural voters from the populous north and northeast. Both groups, who were exasperated by the bureaucratic and military establishment, saw in the billionaire telecoms tycoon someone who could restore national pride after the 1997 Asian economic crisis. A former policeman fond of swift action and populist mobilisation, Thaksin threatened the core elite - monarchists who occupy key formal and informal positions in the country. Protests against Thaksin and Samak reached new heights after Thaksin fled in August to escape a series of corruption-related court cases. Samak has since been publicly distancing himself from Thaksin, and paradoxically, the PAD demonstrations have served his purposes well, giving him a pretext to drop Thaksin loyalists from his cabinet. Samak, an ultra-conservative, has cultivated army commanders in a bid to avert a further coup, something the PAD has been trying to trigger. In much of this, Samak has been advised by a leading power broker, tough-guy ex-minister Newin Chidchob, who has links to the shadowy &quot;pro-Thaksin&quot; Democratic Alliance Against Dictatorship, which was involved in the fatal clash with the PAD. What does the PAD really want? It has advocated a &quot;new politics&quot; based on a parliament with a 70:30 formula: 70% appointees, 30% elected representatives. PAD supporters are drawn largely from the south, where they have blockaded airports, creating chaos for tourists. With Thaksin gone, the movement&apos;s call for a &quot;general uprising&quot; seems rather desperate, and its substantive demands - beyond Samak&apos;s resignation - are confusing. Whereas previous demos involved clear clashes of ideas, neither the PAD nor the DAAD advocate any recognisable form of democracy; Thais are deeply divided into pro-PAD and pro-Thaksin camps. Those on the streets are not the main protagonists in this struggle. The real players are working behind the scenes. On some level, the PAD is receiving moral support from the monarchical network yet the monarchy itself remains sniffy about street protests and sceptical about the real motives of the PAD leadership. Newin Chidchob is rumoured to be coordinating events from a suite at the luxury Pullman Hotel; many senior police officers are personally loyal to him.  Meanwhile Thaksin is holed up in his Surrey mansion and has applied for political asylum in the UK. He is another potential beneficiary: the newly declared state of emergency in Bangkok may strengthen his claim that he should not be sent home just yet. \u00b7 Duncan McCargo is professor of Southeast Asian politics at the University of Leeds comment@theguardian.com", "publicationDate": "2008-09-02T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/03/thailand", "title": "Duncan McCargo: Thaksin's long shadow", "sentences": ["When the first fatality occurred in the clashes between rival &quot;pro-democratic&quot; forces in Bangkok early yesterday morning, people were shocked but not exactly surprised.", "He is another potential beneficiary: the newly declared state of emergency in Bangkok may strengthen his claim that he should not be sent home just yet."]}, {"article": "Amid the deluge of news as Manchester City became an oil-rich club it was striking that the new Abu Dhabi owners did not speak too sweetly about the club itself, its heritage and identity, or the sentiments of its supporters. In most football club takeovers new owners carefully stress how much they value the traditions of the club, and cherish the fans&apos; loyalty. Think of Thaksin Shinawatra&apos;s purchase of City last year or when Tom Hicks and George Gillett walked on to the Anfield pitch wearing Liverpool scarves. Little of that featured in Sulaiman Al Fahim&apos;s statements about the purchase of City by his Abu Dhabi United Group, a vehicle, apparently, for some of the trillion pound oil wealth amassed by the principality&apos;s ruling Al Nahyan family. Al Fahim said he would &quot;solve all the club&apos;s problems&quot; and &quot;clear any pending payments,&quot; suggesting that City were indeed seriously overspending under Thaksin, and he backed his bold talk of making City a top-four team by pouring enough money in to pluck Robinho out of Roman Abramovich&apos;s wallet. Al Fahim was perhaps being more honest than most buyers, not claiming there was anything special about City, acknowledging that his backers &quot;were attracted to the Premier League itself&quot; and might have bid for Arsenal, Liverpool or Newcastle United. Nor did he declare that he or any Al Nahyan is, or has ever been, a dedicated follower of English football. The reason for the purchase of City was made quite clear: it is for the greater glory of Abu Dhabi. &quot;By engaging into sport&apos;s investment, ADUG aims to reinforce Abu Dhabi&apos;s position as a capital of both sport and economic development through ... supporting the emirate&apos;s sports,&quot; the group&apos;s statement said, &quot;and attracting the world&apos;s attention to the United Arab Emirates through this purchase of one of the oldest English clubs.&quot; This extraordinary acquisition, the first by Arab potentates, looks to be launching the Premier League into yet another new financial era, in which more top clubs are likely to be bought as &quot;trophy brands&quot; - owned for the glory they reflect - by the billionaire sheikhs of the Middle East. Dubai International Capital, the investment arm of Dubai&apos;s ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is still holding out to buy Liverpool from Hicks and Gillett, and with the credit crunch squeezing the money available to western investors, these &quot;sovereign wealth funds,&quot; investing rulers&apos; fortunes, are wielding burgeoning power. For decades, England&apos;s professional clubs were owned by local businessmen - also buying prestige - until in the mid-1990s, after the Premier League clubs broke away so as not to share the new TV fortunes paid by BSkyB, several chairmen made millions by floating their clubs on the Stock Exchange. The City quickly lost interest in all the football plcs except Manchester United, but even though the others struggled to make a profit as they spent to compete, their value, and attractiveness to investors, grew because of the Premier League&apos;s glittering success, beamed worldwide by satellite. The recent buyers have been a mix; Abramovich, the Russian oligarch, bought Chelsea as a hobby, and, many have speculated, to gain acceptance in the west. Hicks and Gillett, and the Glazer family who bought Manchester United, did so for business, purchasing prime &quot;brands&quot; whose values will rise in a globally expanding sport. Thaksin Shinawatra&apos;s acquisition of City last year was also financially driven - and he appears to have turned a meaty profit by selling to ADUG, despite this being much sooner than he would have liked and in adversity. Thaksin is also assumed to have wanted City to boost his profile in Thailand, where he was fighting for his reputation, money and freedom, after being ousted as Prime Minister in a military coup, charged with corruption offences and having had his assets frozen. Yet all the goodwill trips by City to Thailand, the hosting of the Thai national team, the happy birthday message to the king of Thailand on the Eastlands scoreboard, have not helped Thaksin fight off prosecution, or gain access to his frozen money. Reluctantly he was forced to sell, and he and his associates turned to the sheikhs, who are said to regard Thaksin well. The executives he installed at City are also well-connected in the region. Pairoj Piempongsant, who was pictured concluding the deal with Al Fahim on Monday holding the blue shirt with Abu Dhabi United on the back (an image which perhaps did not send quite the signal they intended), has been particularly influential. A businessman who gained prominence during Thailand&apos;s 1980s economic boom, Pairoj and another of Thaksin&apos;s City appointments, the Yale and Harvard educated Jack Srisumrid, are directors of Empire Asia, a financial consultancy with offices in Bangkok and Dubai, which specialises in takeovers and claims &quot;an extensive network of relationships&quot; in the Middle East.&quot; Pairoj has made good on the promise to find for City a phenomenally wealthy backer. Sources close to the deal say Thaksin will retain 25% of the club, and Al Fahim said Thaksin would have a position as &quot;honorary president&quot;, with no decision-making power. So Thaksin will retain his involvement and association with Manchester City, but be clear of the Premier League&apos;s &quot;fit and proper person test&quot; if he is convicted of the first corruption charge when the verdict is delivered in a fortnight. The test excludes anybody with a criminal conviction, but applies only to directors and holders of over 30% of a club&apos;s shares. The Abu Dhabi ruling family will take possession of a solid Premier League &quot;brand&quot;, in a new 48,000 capacity stadium already built - by Manchester City Council. The Al Nahyans buy familiarity in the west, too; Amnesty International submitted a report to the United Nations in July raising concerns about alleged human rights abuses in the UAE, including execution by stoning, the flogging of a teenage girl for &quot;illicit sex,&quot; torture of prisoners and harassment of human rights activists, in a country a long way from democracy. Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE&apos;s current president, is a reformer, who has promised &quot;a political system based on consultation, justice and security,&quot; but not votes for the people. As Al Fahim said, ownership of City &quot;attracts the world&apos;s attention to Abu Dhabi&quot; - via one of the globe&apos;s most seductive entertainments, Premier League football. In its essence, this motive is not so different from the social climbing of the old style chairmen, like Peter Swales, who made his fortune, such as it was, in rented tellies in the 1960s. He was City&apos;s intensely unpopular chairman for years. Football club ownership, though, has become global, involving dizzying amounts of money, and mass ownership of television has made it happen. For City fans, the dominant moods yesterday were, withouth doubt, giddy and delighted. There are, though, a drowned-out few feeling uneasy, that when they fell in love with football and the sky blue shirt many moons ago, were not signing up for a game of my-billionaire-is-richer-than-yours.", "publicationDate": "2008-09-02T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Premier League", "Manchester City", "Football", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/sep/02/aneweraforfootballhowcit", "title": "How City became a trophy brand for greater glory of Abu Dhabi", "sentences": ["A businessman who gained prominence during Thailand&apos;s 1980s economic boom, Pairoj and another of Thaksin&apos;s City appointments, the Yale and Harvard educated Jack Srisumrid, are directors of Empire Asia, a financial consultancy with offices in Bangkok and Dubai, which specialises in takeovers and claims &quot;an extensive network of relationships&quot; in the Middle East.&quot; Pairoj has made good on the promise to find for City a phenomenally wealthy backer."]}, {"article": "All too often, politicians and businessmen have said to me: &quot;You&apos;re a businessman, so surely you&apos;re opposed to the green agenda?&quot; They think: &quot;You cannot make a profit and go green.&quot; They think: &quot;A consumer society cannot be a green society.&quot; And they believe that developing economies cannot afford to go green. From my perspective, this is all muddled thinking. I fundamentally disagree, and say that if we want long-term growth, we must go green. Why? Because only by acting now on cutting emissions will we save money in the future. For every \u00a31 we spend now on tackling climate change, we are saving our children anywhere between \u00a35 and \u00a320 at today&apos;s value. Failure to act means risking economic and social disruption on the scale of the great wars and economic depression of the last century. The means to tackle climate change does not just lie in the hands of politicians or regulators, the UN or the G8. If climate change is to be tackled successfully, we need a new framework in which governments, business and consumers each play their part. This is not simply about dividing up responsibility between these groups, as though government is responsible for this, or business for that. I am not advocating a diminished role for government. The role of government in tackling climate change is vital. But it must be fulfilled in ways that meet the needs of our time. Politicians are good at emphasising climate change as the greatest threat of the 21st century, but too often they fail to adapt to this new challenge 20th-century the tools of tax and regulation designed for high-carbon economies. If we are to move to a low-carbon economy, policies - such as tax and planning - must reward low-carbon activities and investment. And too often governments fail to harness the 21st-century power of consumers, incentives and markets, and bring these to bear on tackling climate change too. You may be thinking: &quot;Consumers - aren&apos;t they part of the problem, not the solution?&quot; I see things differently. Consumers account directly and indirectly for 60% of carbon emissions. Get the consumer on side and the task of tackling climate change becomes possible. Lifetime customer loyalty I trust and listen to consumers. I believe in the power of consumers. Tesco&apos;s core purpose is to create value for customers to earn their lifetime loyalty. Customers tell us that they want to go green and do their bit to protect the environment. The challenge for us retailers is to help them do that. Tesco is a global company: each week, over 30 million people shop in our stores around the world. To serve them, we employ 400,000 people. Then there are the countless people who work in firms and businesses, supplying our stores. Imagine if all those people acted to cut carbon emissions in all they did. This would be true collective action. The supply chain, and gradually the economy as a whole, would begin to turn green. Business also has a crucial leadership role to play in empowering consumers, by overcoming barriers of price, incentivising customers to buy greener products, providing better information and innovating through new products and services. If consumers are able to purchase lower-carbon products and services, they will reward the businesses that produce these products. This will encourage competition between businesses to produce more environmental alternatives to current products and services. It will stimulate the research and development to bring forward even better products. And we will begin to create a mass movement in green consumption. So our strategy at Tesco falls into three parts. First, greening Tesco itself. Second, helping turn the supply chain green. And third, helping our customers by making green choices easier and more affordable. To turn Tesco green and reduce our carbon footprint, we need to know which actions emit greenhouse gases and which don&apos;t. So we have measured our carbon footprint, which was 4.47m tonnes of CO2 equivalent for the entire Tesco Group in 2007. To cut this, we have set the entire group some clear targets, with 2006 as our baseline. For example, we aim to halve emissions from our group&apos;s stores and distribution centres by 2020. To halve the carbon emissions from all new stores we build between now and 2020. To halve, by 2012, the amount of CO2 used in our distribution network to deliver a case of goods. To achieve these goals, we&apos;ve changed every aspect of how Tesco operates. We are saving energy in our stores - [by] hanging curtains on freezer doors, for example, and using better insulation, low-energy lighting and new refrigeration systems. In South Korea and Thailand, we are using ice thermal storage, and creating biogas from recycled waste. In China, we are installing energy management systems on the refrigeration in all of our existing stores this year, which will reduce the power consumption of these systems by 15%. Next year, we will expand this to include the air-conditioning. We are reducing the number of empty trips our vans make by ensuring our vans - and our suppliers&apos; vans - are fully loaded, and, in the UK, using our own train and canals to transport goods. We are saving water. Next year, our Chinese business will begin rainwater harvesting and using grey water [non-industrial waste water] for things such as car washing and toilets. We&apos;re using energy-saving technology when we build new projects. In California, our distribution centre has one of the largest solar panel roofs in the US. We&apos;ve set up a \u00a3100m sustainable technology fund to support low-carbon technologies such as wind, solar and ground source heat. In Thailand, we aim to plant 9m trees by 2012: this alone will help reduce CO2 in the atmosphere by 9m tonnes over 40 years. And in the UK, we have invested \u00a325m in the new Sustainable Consumption Institute, to research how we make the transition to a low-carbon economy, and the role that sustainable consumption can play in this. This will aim to contribute to the development of an internationally recognised carbon footprint methodology, and help us understand how customers read labels and respond to them. All the SCI&apos;s research will be released on an open source basis - published as soon as it becomes available, and accessible to all as soon as it is published. It will be led by Mohan Munasinghe, a leading scientist and economist, and vice-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. By the end of this year, our UK energy use per square foot will be half what it was in 2000. Last year, our group carbon intensity per square foot of sales space fell by 4.7%. We are achieving this while Tesco grows. That&apos;s the critical point: the choice is not &quot;green or grow&quot;. That is a false choice. You can do both - and you must do both. Reducing emissions does not merely fight climate change, it also cuts costs. But a green Tesco is only one-third of our ambition. Just as important is greening the supply chain everywhere. In some ways, this is easier to achieve in the developing world. Old practices do not have to be changed. Instead, we can simply apply what we have learned elsewhere. Just as some countries could leapfrog the laying of telephone lines and go straight to the mobile, digital age, there is no reason why, when we set up in developing countries, we cannot create new, green supply lines from scratch. Meanwhile, we&apos;re developing a label that will tell customers the size of a product&apos;s carbon footprint. Armed with that information, they can begin to choose products with smaller footprints. This information revolution is beginning to gather pace worldwide. Bumpy patch People&apos;s values do not change simply because the economy is going through a bumpy patch. What does change is their ability to live up to those values. If the budget for the weekly shop becomes tighter, we need to be sure that going green is not seen as an expensive optional extra. Take energy-saving lightbulbs. They don&apos;t just cut carbon but also cut fuel bills. So in the UK we have permanently halved their price. We&apos;ve sold over 10m in the UK in just over a year, up from 2m the year before. Or carrier bags. In the UK, in just two years, we have saved almost 2bn bags. In Poland, by providing a greater range of reusable bags, we have saved 400m. If retailers help customers, customers will go green. The green agenda is not something that consumers only care about in the US and Europe. It is absurd to think that people in Bangkok, Seoul or Tokyo don&apos;t want a healthy and clean environment just as much as people in Budapest, Warsaw or Los Angeles. Billions of purchases send a signal to cut carbon right down the supply chain and right through the economy. Each time a product is swiped through a checkout, that sale can reduce CO2 emissions. Each consumer who buys a green product is joining the mass movement in green consumption. That movement is what we are seeking to create. A mass movement in green consumption - a movement that shows it is possible to consume, to be green, and to grow.  \u00b7 Sir Terry Leahy is chief executive of Tesco.

He is a wanted man, facing two cases of corruption before the Thai courts, and probable extradition proceedings. But the anti-Thaksin movement in Thailand not only wants to prosecute the former prime minister for fraud and corruption, but is also intent on bringing down the current government in Bangkok, widely viewed as a &quot;proxy&quot; regime, composed mostly of the former prime minister&apos;s acolytes and supporters. Several days ago, the tenacious anti-Thaksin protest movement the PAD (People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy), seized the prime minister&apos;s office, Government House, in Bangkok.  Airports have also been disrupted, hitting Thailand&apos;s tourist industry by leaving thousands of holidaymakers stranded. A frustrated prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, declared a state of emergency from September 1, empowering the military to dislodge PAD protestors. The latest news is that the government has sought court orders to shut down around 400 websites. Thaksin, who dominated Thailand&apos;s politics as elected prime minister for a record five years, is now a wanted man in Bangkok. Ousted by a peaceful military coup in 2006, Thaksin opted for temporary exile in London and bought Manchester City FC. Meanwhile the deposed PM had been under investigation for fraud, corruption and tax evasion, in relation to his actions during his term of office, from 2001-6. By 2007 he had been charged with abusing his position as PM to benefit his business interests, and strengthen his near-monopoly over Thailand&apos;s telecommunications industry.  After his wife was recently found guilty of tax evasion and sentenced to three years&apos; imprisonment, Thaksin sensed that the Thai courts, which in the past had never dared to jail the rich and powerful, might be on the brink of establishing a new precedent. Thaksin had always denied all charges of wrongdoing, but he failed to turn up for his next court appearance and fled back to the UK, issuing a statement that the courts were biased against his family. This has prompted the sensational sale of Manchester City to Abu Dhabi United Group. It was a shrewd move, with the Football Association about to turn up the heat on whether Thaksin&apos;s role at the club fell foul of the requirements that owners and major shareholders should be deemed to be &quot;fit and proper persons&quot;. Now Thaksin has taken a back seat, becoming honorary director, while still retaining a 30% stake in the club. At the same time he has clearly pulled off a financial coup. Given that \u00a31.2bn of his many assets had been frozen by the Thai courts in 2007, he has probably turned in a handsome profit on the sale.  But the Thaksin legend is not just about buying football teams, TV stations and votes from poor farmers at election time. Earlier this year, several lawyers acting for Thaksin were convicted of trying to buy justice when a cake box was discovered in the precincts of Thailand&apos;s supreme court. Inside the box, instead of a cake, were bundles of cash, worth around $60,000 (\u00a330,500). If the court in Bangkok convicts Thaksin of corruption in a land deal on September 17, then the attorney general in Thailand will be obliged to proceed with an extradition request. Lawyers for the deposed premier have been preparing papers for that eventuality and filing a request for political asylum. Before anyone begins to feel sorry for him, let us remember that any claim to be a political refugee, hounded by enemies, fails to take into account not only the unscrupulous pursuit of his business greed, but also the thousands of drug suspects affected by his infamous 2003 &quot;war on drugs&quot; \u2013 a lethal clean up campaign. At the height of his power, he incited police chiefs and governors to demonstrate rapid success rates, rather than respecting human rights and the law. Thaksin still exercises massive influence on the current Thai government, and plots his comeback. The Thaksin legacy has polarised the nation, with most of Bangkok and the middle class wanting to see him behind bars, while the poor majority of the nation see him as the only prime minister who delivered cheap public healthcare and low-interest loans for farmers.  In spite of a state of emergency, neither police nor military want to attack the well-connected PAD leaders and so the PM&apos;s office is still in the hands of the anti-government protestors. Thailand&apos;s coup-prone military is split between the government side, and those top generals who favour the opposition, thus neutralising each other. Some of King Bhumipol&apos;s privy councillors are also deeply opposed to Thaksin&apos;s influence on the country.  The nation&apos;s development has been paralysed, caught between the pro-Thaksin rightwing government and the equally conservative PAD, which has metamorphosed from a populist peoples&apos; power movement into an fanatically royalist\u2013led ideology based on the Thai trinity of nation, religion and monarchy. Some PAD leaders even advocate a reduction of democracy, by limiting parliament to only 30% elected by popular vote and rest appointees. Such reactionary nonsense only plays into the scheming hands of Thaksin and further cements his bonds with the common Tao \u2013 the masses.

No date was set for the referendum but it could be held within 30 days of the Senate passing an enabling law. A cabinet minister said it would ask a range of questions on whether the government should step down or dissolve parliament. But in a rambling 50-minute address to the nation Samak dashed expectations that he would resign, saying he had a mandate to govern and needed to protect democracy.  &quot;I will not abandon the ship, and I will take responsibility for the crew on board,&quot; he said in the almost jocular address that appeared to taunt his opponents. &quot;I can tell you I will not quit. I will not dissolve parliament. I will stay to protect democracy.&quot; The thousands of protesters who have occupied the grounds of his Government House offices for the past 10 days greeted the address, relayed to them on loudspeakers, with jeers and resolved to stay until Samak meets their demand to quit. &quot;As long as he insists on staying on, we will not go anywhere,&quot; said Sondhi Limthongkul, a Peoples&apos; Alliance for Democracy (PAD) leader, told the cheering throng of demonstrators. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter how many days or years, or even into the next life.&quot; Two students among about 100 planning to march on Samak&apos;s residence to press him to quit were slightly wounded tonight after gunmen on a motorcycle fired on the procession at it gathered. Both male students from Ramkhamhaeng University were only slightly wounded but the incident showed the potential for violence that could spiral out of control in the volatile political situation.  The move to hold a referendum appears to be an attempt by the prime minister to regain the initiative. The declaration of emergency rule failed to change the status quo when the army refused to use force to evict the protesters. Earlier court orders obtained by the government to clear the grounds and arrest the protest leaders also had little effect after the police were unable to serve the notices or dislodged the thousand camped inside the barricaded compound. Emerging from today&apos;s cabinet meeting Somsak Kietsuranond, the culture minister, said the government had agreed in principle to stage the referendum. Samak&apos;s People Power party, which leads the six-party coalition government elected last December with a substantial majority, would be likely to win any referendum because of its loyal support among the rural poor.  But while it is being organised, the political stalemate will grind on for weeks, a prospect that Samak brushed aside. &quot;While waiting for the result of the referendum, the protesters can demonstrate,&quot; he said. &quot;I can wait.&quot; In his national address Samak confirmed the resignation of his foreign minister, Tej Bunnag, who said he was leaving his post to care for his ailing wife. But the veteran diplomat was known to have close ties to the palace of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, to whom the anti-government protesters pledge allegiance. &quot;[Tej] has come under pressure from all fronts, so much so that his wife collapsed,&quot; Samak said. &quot;I want to avoid bloodshed. I want to avoid a crisis.&quot; But he described the PAD as a lawless mob and said it was time for Thais to decide which side they were on in the crisis that has pitted the urban elite anti-government demonstrators against the rural poor.

Bangkok Dangerous stars Nicolas Cage as \u2013 wait for it \u2013 a tough guy assassin with a conscience. Cue sarcastic slow handclap. What a stretch for Cage, whose earlier roles include an arms dealer with a conscience in Lord of War, a supernatural vigilante with a conscience in Ghost Rider, a master car thief with a conscience in Gone in 60 Seconds, a dodgy detective with a conscience in Snake Eyes and so on ad infinitum. Has Cage done anything interesting in the last 13 years apart from Adaptation and Leaving Las Vegas, which earned him the Oscar? I don&apos;t think so; but the blame doesn&apos;t rest solely on his shoulders. Over the years directors have failed to push him in new directions and learned instead to commodify a once promising actor as a hack who lurches from wide-eyed animus to gormless neutrality to heavy-lidded existential misery. Don&apos;t expect anything new in Bangkok Dangerous, which US pundits believe will open in the $9-12m range. That could be enough to earn it top billing in the charts, given that Tropic Thunder will begin to slow down dramatically as it enters its fourth weekend and the highest new release last weekend was Babylon AD on $9.4m. Bangkok Dangerous is being released by Lionsgate and the studio, perhaps mindful of what may lie ahead over the next three days, has skimped on its marketing spend. Another reason the studio might be holding back is because it&apos;s releasing so many films these days. In fact Lionsgate is in the midst of a prolific spell unlike any seen by a distributor in years. The spurt began on 1 August with the horror story Midnight Meat Train starring our very own Vinnie Jones and continued last week with the spoof Disaster Movie. Next week sees the arrival of the comedy Tyler Perry&apos;s The Family That Preys followed in successive weeks by the romantic comedy My Best Friend&apos;s Girl, road movie The Lucky Ones and Larry Charles&apos; Borat follow-up documentary Religulous. After a week&apos;s hiatus Lionsgate opens Oliver Stone&apos;s highly anticipated W on 17 October, followed by Saw V a week later and finally the horror title Repo: The Genetic Opera on 7 November. Lionsgate has always been ambitious but this is ridiculous. The studio carved a niche for itself in recent years as a purveyor of hard R horror (R being the rough equivalent of an 18 certificate) like the Saw franchise and arthouse films like Girl With A Pearl Earring but now it&apos;s trying to be all things to all filmgoers. A couple of points are worth mentioning. Lionsgate would appear to be sticking to its hard R horror roots with the upcoming Saw release but the franchise took a dip with the last film and it will be interesting to see whether the fifth instalment performs well enough for studio chiefs to greenlight yet another episode. Word is the studio may be losing its taste for blood and guts as evidenced by the limited release of Midnight Meat Train, which caused uproar among horror fans. One of the most profitable lines in Lionsgate&apos;s stable is the Tyler Perry series of comedies, named after the African-American film-maker and actor whose penchant for gentle proselytising couched in family friendly stories has been generating solid numbers in theatres over the past couple of years and, more importantly, buckets of money on DVD. The Family That Preys should deliver a decent result as Hollywood heads into the autumn season and audiences search for more mature entertainment in the aftermath of the excessive summer. Lionsgate wants to be in business with Perry as long as it can and back in July signed a first-look deal with the filmmaker that will see him provide at least three additional films after his next one comes out in February 2009.

Not to say he&apos;s got any new ideas, but he has at least got a great cast and plenty of energy.

The aim is to become &quot;the Virgin of Asia and the world&quot; with a major re-branding that will involve, among other things, City 24-7 energy drinks, branded Mini Coopers, official club scooters, telephone cards and a chain of City Eating fast-food stores. The proposals demonstrate the ambition of the Abu Dhabi United Group and their unshakeable belief that they have the financial clout to see City catch, then overhaul, Manchester United as the world&apos;s most popular club, first on the pitch and then in terms of commercial income. How City plan to do this is revealed in an 83-page blueprint, A New Model for Partnership in Football, which was influential in convincing the Abu Dhabi royal family to buy the club from the previous owner Thaksin Shinawatra. It is understood the document was put together by the ultra-ambitious Garry Cook, a former Nike executive who was recruited by Thaksin earlier in the summer and whose vision of football involves a Premier League structure with 10to 14 clubs and, most controversially, no promotion or relegation. Cook&apos;s determination to &quot;think global&quot; can be gauged by his recent statement that City&apos;s behind-the-scenes operation had been &quot;a shock&quot; to him when he joined the club as executive chairman, explaining: &quot;You look at our brand and it&apos;s Thomas Cook. But there&apos;s something not quite right about watching us in a bar in Beijing or Bangkok or Tokyo and seeing &apos;Fred Smith&apos;s Plumbing, call 0161...&apos;&quot; He also stated that the Premier League was &quot;10 years behind&quot; the US in merchandising terms. Manchester United, he said, had &quot;not even scratched the surface&quot;. His plans for City include a partnership with Red Bull to bring out drinks called City Powered, City Energy and City 24/7. There are plans to open designer clothing stores and tap into the Indian market, via the Tata Motors Group, by bringing out a range of cars and other vehicles, as well as branded motorcycle helmets. A deal is being discussed with China Mobile to sell City-branded phone cards and Ricky Hatton has been identified to help City Training fitness schemes. At the same time, City genuinely believe enough money will be ploughed into the club to win the Premier League within two or three seasons and, thereafter, be in contention for the Champions League. However, the men in power at Eastlands are also finding out that the rest of the football world is still viewing the new, super-wealthy City through sceptical eyes. One confirmed target, Cesc Fabregas, has described the idea of joining City as being &quot;suicidal&quot; for his career, while another, Klaas Jan Huntelaar, has talked of a &quot;second-rate club&quot; wanting to make him &quot;very rich&quot; on transfer deadline day. Dr Sulaiman Al-Fahim, the billionaire businessman behind the takeover, said last week that City would bid \u00a3135m for Cristiano Ronaldo but the reaction at Old Trafford has been more of bemusement than concern.

Thai politics have been paralysed for weeks by anti-government protesters whose street campaigns demanded the renowned gourmand quit on the grounds he was corrupt. Demonstrators occupied Samak&apos;s compound and the protests turned violent, invoking the declaration of a state emergency. But in the end it was his cookery show that was Samak&apos;s undoing.

The declaration of emergency rule failed, too. But yesterday the Thai prime minister was thrown out of office - for hosting a TV cookery show. The country was cast from political turmoil to high farce after the constitutional court ruled that the embattled prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, and his entire cabinet must quit over the programme. The nine judges in one of Thailand&apos;s highest courts decided that Samak must go immediately for hosting four episodes after taking office, breaching rules that bar ministers having business links. Samak&apos;s ministers must also resign within 30 days once a caretaker administration is appointed to run the country, which has been beset by political crisis since demonstrators took to the streets demanding the prime minister step aside. But government opponents hoping the bizarre twist might resolve the deadlock appear set for disappointment after Samak&apos;s People Power party unanimously pledged to renominate him for prime minister, a role he took up just seven months ago. &quot;This is a complete farce,&quot; said Giles Ungpakorn, a political scientist. &quot;This law was drafted to reduce big business&apos;s influence in government. But here a cooking programme is being equated with big business and the minutiae of the law is being used to get the government out, and the judiciary&apos;s taking part in the farce. It should have been thrown out of court.&quot; Government opponents from the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD), which has occupied the grounds of Samak&apos;s offices for two weeks, failed to dislodge the PM, whom they accuse of corruption and being a puppet of his ousted predecessor, Thaksin Shinawatra.  Clashes between PAD protesters and government supporters left one dead and dozens injured, prompting Samak to declare emergency rule.  But yesterday the court declared that Samak&apos;s &quot;position as prime minister has ended&quot; over his part in the long-running cookery show, Tasting, Grumbling. Samak, 73, had hosted the television programme for the past eight years while he was Bangkok&apos;s governor, but gave up in April two months after becoming prime minister. The popular show featured the passionate foodie wrapped in an apron whipping up traditional Thai recipes - pork leg in Coca-Cola is a favourite - before indulging in a ranting monologue on subjects of his choosing.  The grumpy rightwinger would often visit restaurants or food stalls offering cooking tips. His other preferred haunts were Bangkok&apos;s &quot;wet&quot; food markets, where he would cast an expert eye over the produce. But the \u00a3270 he received for travelling expenses and buying the ingredients for each of the final shows after he assumed office was his undoing. He denied he had been moonlighting in the employment of the show&apos;s producers. The court disagreed, saying that Samak had &quot;fabricated his evidence&quot; and presented &quot;conflicting testimony&quot; to conceal the truth.  &quot;His employment at the company can be considered employment,&quot; said Chat Chonlaworn, the chief judge. The judges ruled he had breached the clause in the constitution, which was rewritten after the 2006 military coup. It was designed to eliminate the conflicts of interest that bedevilled the rule of the telecoms tycoon Thaksin. However, the new constitution stipulates no further sanction for the prime minister, beyond being forced to stand down. It allows his party to choose him once again, as its leaders say they will when they meet on Friday . After initial jubilation the demonstrators occupying Samak&apos;s compound began to realise the ruling was unlikely to significantly alter the landscape or break the stalemate. &quot;Samak was ousted by the court,&quot; said a PAD spokesman, Suriyasai Katasila. &quot;But there is no guarantee he will not return in the next few days.

Samak Sundaravej will surely go down as the only prime minister anywhere who has lost office for culinary reasons. His cookery show on television was yesterday deemed to offend against a law which stipulates that the prime minister must not engage in private business. No matter that Mr Samak did the show for fun and because it helped give him a jovial political profile, or that he gave the few baht he earned for it to his driver. Justice is not to be mocked and Mr Samak and his cabinet have to step down, although they may well all be reappointed in a couple of days after a fresh vote in parliament.  Needless to say, it was not Mr Samak&apos;s recipe for leg of pork cooked in Coca-Cola, one of his more unwise suggestions, which constituted the real offence, but his recipe for ruling Thailand. Samak came to power as a liege man of Thaksin Shinawatra, the populist politician who dominated the political scene in Thailand before he was deposed in a military coup in 2006. The generals and their civilian allies ruled for a while and then held fresh elections, thinking that with Mr Thaksin in exile and his party banned, they could get a result to their liking. But Mr Thaksin&apos;s political party simply renamed itself, swept the board again in the polls, and put Mr Samak in his place to keep his seat warm until legal problems arising from corruption charges against him and his wife could be sorted out. But those who had brought down Mr Thaksin in the first place were not ready either to let him return or to allow a Thaksin government under another name to stay in power. A campaign of protests by the so-called People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy similar to that which had helped push Mr Thaksin out was now aimed at Mr Samak. The protests got larger, spilled on to the prime minister&apos;s lawn, and led to counter protests, an unfortunate development given Samak&apos;s small but well remembered role in the political crisis which led to the October 1976, massacre of students in Bangkok by rightwing militia. It is true there are some murky episodes in Mr Samak&apos;s history, but that is also the case with almost everybody else in this drama on both sides, including Mr Thaksin and General Prem Tinsulanonda, the influential adviser to the ailing King.  Some of leaders of PAD have meanwhile demonstrated their ignorance of what they are supposedly defending by demanding an appointed corporatist legislature of the kind once favoured by European fascists. Mr Thaksin was a flawed politician who broke rules and cut corners, and Samak is his henchman, but both were elected by a large popular vote and that is, or ought to be, the bottom line.", "publicationDate": "2008-09-09T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/10/thailand", "title": "Editorial: Cooks, courts and coups - how the Thai prime minister's cookery programme lost him his office", "sentences": ["The protests got larger, spilled on to the prime minister&apos;s lawn, and led to counter protests, an unfortunate development given Samak&apos;s small but well remembered role in the political crisis which led to the October 1976, massacre of students in Bangkok by rightwing militia."]}, {"article": "In the mix ...

His critics allege that he was actually never more than a puppet stooge of one Thaksin Shinawatra, the former PM who was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and now purportedly pulls the strings from exile in the UK.  It strikes me that Samak&apos;s saga could be played as a classic love triangle, with our hero caught between two masters and acting like a fool. Who&apos;s his real boss? The deposed Thaksin or the rapacious executives at Coca-Cola Global, insisting that he takes time off from a crucial summit to televise another pork stewing session? I think the film needs a goofy, quirky approach. Someone like David O Russell could make a good fist of it. As to the casting, we note that Samak is actually of Chinese descent.

Somchai Wongsawat, 61, a former bureaucrat and long-serving judge who is married to Thaksin&apos;s younger sister, won the support of most of the six-party governing coalition&apos;s MPs. The vote appeared to heal rifts that surfaced even within his own ruling People Power party (PPP), which had wrangled for five days to choose a new candidate after Samak Sundaravej was forced to quit as prime minister for hosting a cookery show while in office. The urbane and softly spoken Somchai - in stark contrast to the abrasive Samak - immediately crossed the floor of parliament to shake hands with the opposition leader, Abhisit Vejjajiva. Somchai appealed for unity to heal the divisions that have paralysed Thailand&apos;s political landscape. But anti-government demonstrators of the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy - who occupied the prime minister&apos;s compound in an effort to evict Samak, accused of being a Thaksin stooge - immediately targeted Somchai. Somchai was derided by the protesters&apos; leaders as yet another crony from the Thaksin administration deposed in the 2006 coup. They pledged to continue the three-week sit-in until the PPP-led government is swept away. &quot;Thaksin needs someone he can control,&quot; the protest leader, Somsak Kosaisuk, told the throng camped at Bangkok&apos;s Government House. &quot;He might have a gentlemanly nature and a soft-spoken style and be better than anyone else [in the PPP], but blood is thicker than water.&quot; The continued opposition does not augur well for Somchai, who vowed to try to see out the government&apos;s term, which runs until 2012. Analysts give him a matter of months, with the PPP facing the prospect of dissolution by the courts on the grounds of electoral fraud in last December&apos;s poll. Somchai - who was education minister and became caretaker prime minister after Samak - is likely to adopt a more conciliatory style that will help hold together the fractious coalition. His 20 years in the judiciary puts him in proximity to Thailand&apos;s powerful royalist-military elite. But his Achilles heel - as opponents see it - is his marriage to Thaksin&apos;s sister, Yaowapa Wongsawasdi. She was a senior figure in Thaksin&apos;s Thai Rak Thai party and one of 111 MPs banned from politics for five years in the wake of the coup.

Photograph: Pornchai Kittiwongsakul/AFP/Getty    Bout was seized at a Bangkok luxury hotel in March in the culmination of a year-long sting by US agents. He said nothing as he arrived for the hearing, which had been repeatedly delayed. His defence lawyer, Preecha Prasertsak, announced he had petitioned the court to dismiss the proceedings on four terrorism conspiracy counts filed in the US on the grounds the former Soviet air force officer had been held illegally. The judges adjourned for 30 minutes but then said they would consider Preecha&apos;s appeal at another hearing to be fixed later. &quot;My client is innocent,&quot; Preecha said. Bout has denied any wrongdoing. He has long been one of the world&apos;s most wanted men for arms smuggling. He has a reputation for busting UN weapons embargoes to supply infamous warlords like Liberia&apos;s Charles Taylor. If extradited to the US and convicted he faces life imprisonment on indictments including conspiracy to kill US citizens and providing material support to terrorists. The charges are based on conversations recorded at a Bangkok luxury hotel in March between Bout and US Drug Enforcement Agency agents who were posing as Colombian Farc rebels. Washington lists Farc as a terrorist group. US prosecutors allege Bout offered to supply 700 surface-to-air missiles, guns, state-of-the-art helicopters and aircraft capable of firing missiles. The undercover agents had penetrated Bout&apos;s inner circle and won his trust, prosecutors say. Bout maintains he has been held unlawfully on &quot;fabricated American accusations&quot;. He stands accused of being a global gun-runner to Africa, the Middle East and South America, running a fleet of cargo planes since the early 1990s.

By &quot;waste&quot; she doesn&apos;t mean the stuff that goes into wheelie bins or on to landfill sites; she means the unmentionables we flush down the loo - supposing we&apos;re lucky enough to have one.  &quot;Shit&quot; is her preferred usage, rather than excreta, faeces or stools. The topic invites euphemism or tittering toilet humour, but she has an answer to those who think it beneath their dignity: how a society disposes of its sewage tells you a lot about its economy, politics and religion, she says. Disgust may be an understandable reaction (&quot;Oh! Celia, Celia, Celia shits,&quot; Jonathan Swift cried in horror), and the author is no coprophagist. But without rubbing our noses in it, she shows how the problems associated with shit are impacting on the Earth. The statistics are horrifying: 2.6 billion people - 40% of the world&apos;s population - with no access to a toilet or latrine; 90% of our sewage discharged, untreated, into oceans, rivers and lakes; 10 million viruses and 1 million bacteria in each gram of faeces; every 15 seconds a child dies of diarrhoea caused by contaminated water. In the face of such facts, polite avoidance of the subject seems irresponsible. But persuading people to discuss it openly (as they have learned to with formerly taboo subjects such as sex and death) is a struggle. An advertisement for Velvet toilet tissue in 2002, with artily photographed bare bottoms and the slogan &quot;Love your bum&quot;, was the second most complained-about ad that year. Celebs will do their bit for WaterAid but not for sanitation. Even those in the industry are shy about admitting it, for fear the rest of us will back away. With no qualifications except an intrepid spirit and a resolve to look and learn, George visits some of the dirtiest places in the world. She goes down among the turds in London&apos;s sewers, finding the air surprisingly wholesome but the number of employees or &quot;flushers&quot; (a mere 30-odd for the whole of the capital) alarmingly small. She inspects school lavatories in South Africa (where they exist, and are clean, the attendance rate is higher), mingles with untouchables in India (though officially they no longer exist), samples a biogas stove in faeca-philiac China (it runs off converted human excrement), watches latrine pits being emptied in Dar es Salaam (sledgehammers and kerosene do the trick), and handles the sludge used as a fertiliser by American farmers (&quot;It looks and feels like a crumbled brownie&quot;). Less gruellingly, she samples state-of-the-art lavatories in Japan, which can check your blood pressure, play music and automatically put the seat down for you, but which have had no more success as an export to the US than the bidet did - to middle America, anal washing seems pervy and louche. Australia is about the only place George doesn&apos;t visit, though she does talk to Aussies in the business. Whenever there&apos;s a toilet conference, be it in Moscow or Bangkok, there she is with her notebook and an ear cocked for absurdity.  Along the way, she explodes a number of myths. That we in the west are well sorted in terms of &quot;watsan&quot; (water and sanitation), for instance. Not so: recent years have seen outbreaks of disease from Galway to Milwaukee and catastrophic sewer overflows in London and New York. Nor are developing countries as indifferent to hygiene as popularly alleged: George meets countless evangelists waging war on ignorance, not least in India, where local initiatives have brought sanitation to villagers who used to squat in the bushes or next to ponds. The dream is to create a continent that&apos;s ODF, open defecation-free - no more bottoms discharging on to the railway in the slums of Mumbai and elsewhere. Though charmed by the evangelists, George is sceptical of their claims to lasting success. And having listened to the arguments on both sides, she can&apos;t decide where she stands on biosolids: are the Americans and Chinese who use human shit as fertiliser noble recycling pioneers or dangerous polluters? The book seems repetitive at times, because of its structure - part travel book, part reportage, part polemic - and it&apos;s a pity the notion of waste wasn&apos;t broadened out. It&apos;s an invaluable contribution nevertheless. &quot;Shit&apos;s shit,&quot; Andrew Motion once wrote (poets seem better at facing the issue head-on), &quot;and what we desire in the world is less, not more, of it.&quot; Less won&apos;t happen, with the global population expanding at its current rate. But given that &quot;sanitation is one of the best investments a country can make&quot; (good for health, tourism and the economy), it&apos;s bewildering how little is spent on it - whether in Pakistan (which spends 47 times more on its military, despite 120,000 diarrhoea-related deaths a year) or in the UK (where sewage systems in many cities haven&apos;t changed since Bazalgette). Rose George doesn&apos;t pretend to have the answers. But as she prods, pesters and provokes, she proves an excellent shit-stirrer.  \u2022 Blake Morrison&apos;s South of the River is published by Vintage", "publicationDate": "2008-09-26T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Science and nature", "Books", "Culture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/27/scienceandnature", "title": "Review: The Big Necessity by Rose George", "sentences": ["Whenever there&apos;s a toilet conference, be it in Moscow or Bangkok, there she is with her notebook and an ear cocked for absurdity."]}, {"article": "Goldfinger Sport Golf Against Auric Goldfinger Prize A bar of Nazi gold Does Bond win?

An early win nets him a baddie&apos;s sports car, but then he gets cocky and loses a crucial game to Le Chiffre. For once it isn&apos;t part of a complicated bluff; Bond simply gets stiffed by a four-of-a-kind. After drinking poison, dying and being resuscitated, he returns to the table and wins the pot with a running flush. Bonus sport Parkour.

The overall experience gave her a special perspective on the crucial importance of building peace and understanding, which made her one of the most valuable members of British Red Cross in her retirement. Having seen so much deprivation across the world, in 2000 she also readily agreed to work as a trustee for the Beit Trust and the Chalker Foundation for Africa, which seeks to develop and support medical knowledge and training on the continent. Maeve enthused all who worked with her. We first met when she headed the West Africa department of the Foreign Office, some months after I became minister of state for Africa and Europe in January 1986. We first travelled together to Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Benin, and she put me to shame, managing to eat snails, cutlets of snake and other such delicacies on the tables of leaders and presidents, while I failed. To this day, former President Obasanjo of Nigeria teases me about her fortitude and my delicate appetite. In later years we shared the frustration of seeking ways to bring the rival Frelimo and Renamo movements together in Mozambique to end the civil war, but also the good fortune of the protection of Britain&apos;s military police when we travelled to &quot;difficult&quot; places. These bodyguards, who Maeve referred to always as &quot;my boys&quot;, helped keep her sane when life became claustrophobic in Beirut by taking her on weekend picnics in the mountains, always with her adored dog Chloe. It was in South Africa that Maeve found a whole new world of friends and experiences. Arriving there in 1996, she became a valued discussant of Nelson Mandela and his ministers. She opened her home and her diary to the widest range of South Africans and to many official and private visitors. Indeed, I once had the temerity to suggest that perhaps she should have a little more time to herself. Such an idea was kindly but firmly rebuffed, for she prided herself on being &quot;in the know&quot; about anything and everything that would assist the British-South African relationship. Her encouragement to her staff and friends marked Maeve out as a wise leader. Whether it was in negotiation, in presenting an unwelcome message to a host government, in reorganising a part of her office, or in planning a major event, she gave her best. Born in Liverpool, the only child of a hospital administrator, she attended Nantwich grammar school but left early to go to Trinity College Dublin when she discovered that the college did not then require A-levels. After graduating in English and French, she took up a French government scholarship at the Sorbonne. She was reportedly advised that she had no hope of getting into the Foreign Office - being both a woman and a non-Oxbridge candidate - but in the event she became one of 12 successful entrants to the FO junior grade in 1962. Maeve worked her way through the ranks, serving in New York, Bangkok, Bonn and Lagos, before in 1978 joining the UK mission to the UN, where she established herself as a sensitive negotiator, particularly in the Namibian contact group, which sought to help achieve peaceful inependence.  In 1982 she spent a year at the Royal College of Defence Studies, followed by a posting to Santiago, before returning to London in 1986 as head of the west African department and concurrently non-resident ambassador to Chad. She then became ambassador to Mozambique (1989-92) and Lebanon (1992-96), and high commissioner to South Africa (1996-2000). She was also one of the few people to become a &quot;double dame&quot;, being made a DCMG in 1998 for her government service, and the following year a DCVO, a decoration awarded specifically by the Queen. All who worked with Maeve found her an inspiring and fun friend as well as a sound team leader. She never lost a friend, wherever they came from, although she sometimes suffered considerable frustration with her computer and email address list. Technology was not her friend, so she was ever grateful to her good neighbour in London who spent many hours sorting out her technical &quot;limitations&quot; in recent years. She was a great party giver and goer, always at the centre of the best conversations, great storytelling, yet she listened to the needs of friends with deep compassion and, when asked, gave sound advice. When troubled by a problem, she often pottered in the garden of the overseas residence or, later, her home in France.  Her kindness to her friends was legendary, and also to her staff. Her concern for others after the appalling fire in the Cape Town residence in 1999, despite the total devastation of her possessions, are lasting reminders of this.  This wise and loving lady will be sorely missed by all who knew her. \u2022 Maeve Geraldine Fort, diplomat, born November 19 1940; died September 18 2008", "publicationDate": "2008-10-01T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Foreign policy", "Politics", "South Africa", "United Nations", "Mozambique", "UK news", "World news", "Africa"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/02/foreignpolicy.southafrica", "title": "Obituary: Dame Maeve Fort", "sentences": ["Maeve worked her way through the ranks, serving in New York, Bangkok, Bonn and Lagos, before in 1978 joining the UK mission to the UN, where she established herself as a sensitive negotiator, particularly in the Namibian contact group, which sought to help achieve peaceful inependence."]}, {"article": "Sheila Hancock&apos;s The Two of Us, about her life with the actor John Thaw and her convulsive grief at his death, sold more than 700,000 copies in hardback and won her the 2005 Author of the Year award. Now comes Just Me, which deals with the years since Thaw&apos;s death and her various strategies for moving on.  Once again it has the passionate appeal of their love story and is infused with humanity, self-perception and honesty. The thousands of people - many of them widows - who wrote to her following the earlier book will again find solace and comfort in what she has to tell them. But so will many others - those who warm to her gift for directly communicating the open-heartedness and spirit of adventure with which she confronts her life.  This time there is less of Thaw, though &quot;Mr Um Er&quot;, as he was known because of his dithering, remains the touchstone for her sorrow and is always in the background, with his &quot;bah humbug&quot; attitude to Christmas. He is the man, she writes, who &quot;thought she was beautiful and never stopped saying so&quot;. But he is gone and she must move on. She does so through travel, both as a tourist to a multitude of destinations and into her own character and past. She is also determined to make something positive of life as a woman of 75 living alone. Since she had few holidays as a child, and few as an actor, many places are new and fresh to her eyes. And she is no passive traveller. She joins a Solo tour group to Budapest and gets into a fine old row with the guide - &quot;a plump, rather dour little woman&quot; - who insists that a certain bridge across the Danube is a copy of Barnes Bridge, when Hancock knows it is Hammersmith. She is arrested in Bangkok because her two names, Thaw and Hancock, strike the authorities as suspicious. She rides an elephant, and kicks off her shoes to nuzzle its skin - &quot;he acknowledges this with a backward swing of his trunk&quot;. She visits Venice and tackles the art, favouring the paintings of Carpaccio and falling for his little white dog, then heads to Milan in pursuit of Bellini. When snooty guides put her down she bounces back: &quot;Stuff that. I am a novice and enjoy the pictures on my own terms.&quot; And we are cheering her on. Most movingly, and in the book&apos;s finest descriptive passage, she writes of tracing her roots to Germany, a country for which she retains a visceral hatred born of a wartime childhood. Taking part in BBC1&apos;s Who Do You Think You Are? has revealed an ancestral family of Germans, the Zurhorsts, and she goes in search. In the strange silent farmlands of Westphalia she trudges through ploughed fields and arrives at &quot;a place that seemed to be a restaurant&quot;, where a surly waiter serves bad food and shows her a letter that concludes &quot;Heil Hitler&quot;. Finally, as she crosses an area where workmen are demolishing a building, one of them makes a deliberate run at her with his digger. She stands her ground. &quot;It dawned on me that in rural Germany I am still the enemy.&quot; This calls for a total rethink of her own attitudes, and by the end her blind hatred has been swept away. She is a woman of easy and impulsive reactions, given to immediate impressions and thankful to see good in other people. She speaks of her Quaker background and its injunction to &quot;live adventurously&quot;. But there is something else that makes her story so appealing to so many. And she herself spots it. &quot;An actor like me is inclined to overdo the empathy because it is part of our job to put ourselves in other people&apos;s shoes.&quot; It&apos;s an empathy that extends to all sorts and conditions of people.  She does it for me when she talks of life as an older woman. At an Italian spa for the beautiful people, she slinks to a lounger away from the pool and lies down &quot;very quickly, because when you lie flat the slack of your skin drops back and you look smoother than when you&apos;re standing up&quot;. Not that anyone notices. As she says: &quot;It is a proven fact that after 50 women do dissolve.&quot; Later, another spa and a more resigned attitude: &quot;I neither expect nor hope to be noticed.&quot; Women need to be noticed in restaurants, though, and there is a caustic account of trying to catch the eye of gossiping waiters in one of London&apos;s most famous fish restaurants. &quot;Hello, I&apos;m here. I thought I was invisible.&quot;  Sheila Hancock is not invisible at all: she is still acting - last year she won an Olivier award for her role as Fr\u00e4ulein Schneider in Cabaret - she mentors a child through the charity Kids Company, and is chancellor of Portsmouth University. She is also strangely self-deprecating - &quot;most of my achievements are mediocre&quot; - and given to Shakespearean musings: &quot;What a piece of work is man&quot;; &quot;Lord, what fools these mortals be!&quot; But she has an ability, shared with Tracey Emin, to spill her ideas, thoughts and feelings directly on to the page. It is the stuff of bestsellers.  \u2022 Joan Bakewell&apos;s The View from Here: Life at Seventy is published by Guardian Books. \u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday October 7 2008.

Those days of wine and roses were never going to last forever. The time when the world was our oyster and a pearl could be prised from it with a mere flick of a credit card has well and truly passed. The wheels have come off the economy, and our travels have ground to a halt.  At least that&apos;s what it feels like.  Now, I hate to sound like some latter-day Pollyanna but the cloud under which the words &quot;credit&quot; and &quot;crunch&quot; have been joined in unholy matrimony may yet prove to possess a silver lining. Looking back in a few years&apos; time there&apos;s just a chance we might come to recognise this as the moment we rediscovered something that we&apos;d lost amid our frenzied consumption of travel. Let me take you back to Rimini in the late 1980s. Bored to distraction on a package holiday, I decided to slip away for a couple of days&apos; hitchhiking. As the sun began to set, one kindly driver invited me to dinner with his relations. This turned out to be an extended affair conducted, depending on which family member was speaking to me, in irreparably broken English, French, German, Latin, cod Latin and, usually most profitably of all, hand gestures. Needless to say, we never got around to discussing the latest discoveries in the world of particle physics or the competing merits of Caravaggio and Titian. However, that happy evening is the one vivid memory I retain from that holiday. Perhaps it&apos;s not a coincidence that it was also the only evening that hadn&apos;t been organised for me by the tour operator and, incidentally, hadn&apos;t cost me a penny either. That&apos;s not to say, of course, that all budget holidays are fabulous and that spending a bit of extra money won&apos;t get you a nicer holiday. It&apos;s just that it might not get you a better holiday either - very often, all it will do is make the experience more comfortable. Flashing the cash might spare us the bumpy seats and disconcerting smells of third class, but holed up with the other tourists in first we miss the interactions with the food sellers, the woman sitting on the crate of chickens, or the children who want to try on our sunglasses. We&apos;re there, but we&apos;re not really there. There&apos;s another upside to our new found austerity. If we have to start rationing our travel there&apos;s more chance that we&apos;ll make sure we enjoy those trips we do take to the full. It&apos;s like chocolate. Now that we eat it all year round it&apos;s still pleasant but it&apos;s not that special: in the days when, for most people, it was a once-in-a-blue-moon treat it was something to be relished.  So, as the nation resounds to the tightening of belts, what do cheapo holidays in this not so brave new world look like? Actually, pretty attractive. In these stressful times, we yearn for a chance to slow down, and happily it&apos;s the cheaper ways of getting around - bicycles and walking boots - that are also among the slowest. We want to have our faith in humanity restored. So ditch the beautiful but expensive hotel and go couchsurfing. We want to try out what it&apos;s like to live somewhere else. Do a house swap and find out. And there&apos;s really no need to fork out on a long haul flight to find something fresh and new. Madly, many of us know Bangkok and New York better than the towns and cities just up the road - why not give them a go? You won&apos;t have to change your money or pack a phrase book, and the locals probably won&apos;t bite. If you prefer to lose yourself in nature there&apos;s more good news - this island&apos;s absolutely brimming with the stuff. Beaches, mountains, forests, meadows, hills, rivers - take your pick, they&apos;re all here, there&apos;s no entry fee, and the chances are there&apos;s a cracking hostel or campsite just around the corner. But perhaps the best thing is that wherever you go to - be it somewhere close at hand or some far flung slice of exotica - having to stick to a budget when you get there can make travel the adventure it once was. It&apos;s not about doing the backpacker slumming it thing either. Just by having to be creative about how you engage with your new surroundings you allow them the time and space to work their particular magic on you. Whisper it, but you might have a lot more fun too.  \u2022 Dixe Wills, writing as Johnson P Johnson, is the author of The Armchair Naturalist (Icon, \u00a37.99). \u2022 Read about bargain beach holidays here\u2022 Find out more about cheap European City Breaks here\u2022 Find out how to get cheaper flights here\u2022 Find out how you can take the family on holiday without breaking the bank here\u2022 Read about adventure holidays at bargain prices here", "publicationDate": "2008-10-03T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Budget travel", "Travel"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/oct/04/budget.holidays", "title": "Dixe Wills on cheap holidays", "sentences": ["Madly, many of us know Bangkok and New York better than the towns and cities just up the road - why not give them a go?"]}, {"article": "Ricky Walden, the world No35 from Flint, more than quadrupled his previous best pay day by beating Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan, the world&apos;s No1, 10-8 to win the \u00a352,000 first prize in the Shanghai Masters. Beaten for only the ninth time in his 33 ranking finals, O&apos;Sullivan took \u00a325,000 as runner-up. Quoted at 80-1 prior to the tournament, Walden had previously reached only one ranking quarter-final but after winning a six-reds tournament in Bangkok in July and the non-ranking Belgian Open last month he had come to Shanghai with high expectations. &quot;To be honest, I&apos;ve been coming to events for about three years now, thinking I could win them,&quot; said the 25-year-old. Wins over Stephen Hendry, 5-4, Neil Robertson, 5-4 from 4-1 down, Steve Davis, 5-2 after losing the first two frames, and Mark Selby, the Masters champion, 6-4 from 4-1 down, meant he became the last obstacle to O&apos;Sullivan, winner of the world championship at the end of last season and the Northern Ireland trophy at the start of this, emulating Davis and Hendry with a hat-trick of world-ranking titles. O&apos;Sullivan&apos;s best is unstoppably sublime but even he cannot play to that standard all day, every day. The closing phase of his semi-final against Stephen Maguire, his closest pursuer in the rankings, was outstanding as consecutive breaks of 141 and 84 put him 4-3 up, only for Maguire to reply with 101 and 76 before O&apos;Sullivan seized his 6-5 victory with 87 and 145. Although he had his moments in the final, with a 108 break to lead 6-5, he was unusually prone to unforced errors as Walden won four of the next five frames to go two up with three to play. Two frames later Walden clinched victory in style with a break of 108 to rise to 17th in the provisional rankings, going into the Royal London Watches grand prix, which starts on Saturday.", "publicationDate": "2008-10-05T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Snooker", "Sport", "Ronnie O'Sullivan"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/oct/06/snooker", "title": "Snooker: Walden topples O'Sullivan in Shanghai shock", "sentences": ["Quoted at 80-1 prior to the tournament, Walden had previously reached only one ranking quarter-final but after winning a six-reds tournament in Bangkok in July and the non-ranking Belgian Open last month he had come to Shanghai with high expectations."]}, {"article": "At least 65 people were injured in Bangkok today after riot police broke up a blockade of parliament using teargas. Seven protesters were seriously injured including a man whose left leg was blown off at the knee by gunfire, and another who was hit in the chest with shrapnel. Bangkok&apos;s deputy policy chief, Umnuey Nimmanno, defended the use of teargas and denied any other weapon had been used. &quot;It is conventional practice in dispersing a crowd. We did not use disproportionate force,&quot; he said. After the rally dispersed, 5,000 demonstrators regrouped to shout down the first policy speech to parliament by Thailand&apos;s new prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat. They also blocked all four entrances to the parliament building, locking MPs and ministers inside and cutting off their water and electricity supply with the help of sympathetic state utility workers. At one point a sewage lorry tipped its load outside the building, according to Reuters. Somchai opened the parliamentary session after a 90-minute delay but as he spoke unrest spread outside.  &quot;We will be here all day today. We will fight here,&quot; said Sirichai Mai-ngam, one of the leaders of People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy, who organised the protest. The latest violence comes after six weeks of political crisis that has gripped Thailand and virtually paralysed the government. The alliance claims that Somchai is a proxy for his brother-in-law, the former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who was overthrown by the military in 2006. An army spokesman, Colonel Sansern Kaewkamnerd, said the military was &quot;concerned&quot; about the violence against unarmed protesters and that any serious injuries should be investigated. He dismissed speculation of a military intervention to end the unrest in Thailand. The military has staged 18 coups since the country became a constitutional monarchy in 1932. The alliance wants a major overhaul of the electoral system. Protesters claim Thailand&apos;s rural majority is too poorly educated to responsibly choose a government and is susceptible to vote buying. There are also demands for some MPs to be chosen by professions and social groups.  Somchai was sworn in as prime minister on September 25 but has been forced to run the government from a makeshift office at Bangkok&apos;s airport. When protesters originally took over the grounds of government house in August their intention was to oust then prime minister Samak Sundaravej whom they also accused of being a puppet of Thaksin.

Announcing the prize, Horace Engdahl, the permanent secretary of the Nobel judges, saluted him as an &quot;author of new departures, poetic adventure and sensual ecstasy, explorer of a humanity beyond and below the reigning civilisation&quot;. Le Cl\u00e9zio is the first French writer to take the 10m Swedish Krona (\u00a3815,000) prize since the French-Chinese author Gao Xingjian in 2000, although he was reluctant to identify himself strictly as a Frenchman. &quot;I started in France, but my father was a British citizen, born in Mauritius. So I see myself as a mix, like many people currently in Europe.&quot; &quot;I am very touched and very emotional, it is a great honour for me,&quot; he said, adding that he had been busy writing when the call came through. &quot;(I felt) some kind of incredulity, and then some kind of awe, and then some kind of joy and mirth,&quot; he told reporters at a press conference in Paris on Thursday afternoon. Asked if he deserved the prize, he replied &quot;Why not?&quot; Born in 1940, Le Cl\u00e9zio first found fame aged 23 with his debut novel Le Proc\u00e8s-Verbal, which was awarded the Prix Renaudot for its depiction of a young man who ends up in a mental hospital. Compared to Sartre&apos;s Nausea and Camus&apos;s The Outsider, the book introduced one of Le Cl\u00e9zio&apos;s major preoccupations, that of the flight from the norm to extreme states of mind. It is still regarded as one of his best pieces of writing. His real breakthrough as a novelist came with 1980&apos;s D\u00e9sert, whose tale of a lost culture in the North African desert and a Europe seen through the eyes of immigrants won him a French Academy prize. As well as living in France, the UK, Bangkok, Mexico City and Boston, between 1969 and 1973 Le Cl\u00e9zio lived with the Embera Indians in Panama. He has written of his time there in Ha\u00ef and Voyage de l&apos;autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, and has also translated some of the major works of the Indian tradition, such as Les proph\u00e9ties du Chilam Balam. His Le r\u00eave mexicain ou la pens\u00e9e interrompue shows his fascination with Mexico&apos;s past. The theme of the natural world is a unifying one for his writing, which spans some 50 novels, essays and short stories - although much of it is unavailable in print in the UK today. &quot;There are two phases to Le Cl\u00e9zio&apos;s career,&quot; said Adrian Tahourdin, French editor of the Times Literary Supplement. &quot;There&apos;s the early, more experimental work up until the early to mid 70s, and then he switched to much more lyrical, traditional narrative style, and started exploring other cultures more.&quot; Tahourdin said Le Cl\u00e9zio was a &quot;very worthy&quot; winner, although he was surprised by the choice. &quot;You can never second guess the sages of Stockholm, but he&apos;s a very good choice, he&apos;s a very good novelist,&quot; he said, adding that Le Cl\u00e9zio fitted the Nobel prize criteria of finding a body of work moving in an &quot;ideal direction&quot; rather well, writing as he does from the perspective of the downtrodden and dispossessed. One of Le Cl\u00e9zio&apos;s English translators, Alison Anderson, said she was &quot;absolutely over the moon&quot; at the news. &quot;I think the Nobel committee has made a choice for a voice of reason and compassion and empathy, which is not necessarily fashionable in literature, but is very important,&quot; she said. Anderson met Le Cl\u00e9zio when her English translation of his Onitsha was published, and said he was a &quot;very charming man - not reserved, but self-effacing&quot;. She described Onitsha as the work she was most proud of translating; &quot;he writes very classical, beautiful French...it&apos;s very slow and incantatory so to keep that rhythm is a challenge, but very rewarding,&quot; she added. She hopes the win will mean more of his writing is translated into English. &quot;I always thought he was underacknowledged in the Anglo Saxon world. I continued to read his books after I translated Onitsha and I always thought they were wonderful - very quiet and moving.

The latest culprit is that monster of depravity Harry Enfield, whose show Harry and Paul has aroused the wrath of the Philippine ambassador to the UK, Edgardo Espiritu, with its allegedly racist depiction of a Filipina housemaid.  Last year, similar protests drew a craven apology from the US network ABC, over the disparagement of Philippine medical schools in Desperate Housewives. But here, Mr Espiritu appears to be on shakier ground. The most cursory examination of the offending sketch suggests that the real target of the satire is Enfield&apos;s wealthy character, who has a &quot;pet Northerner&quot; that he tries to mate with a neighbour&apos;s maid. The satire is social, not racial, attacking those who see the poor as being somehow less than human. I&apos;ve known several Filipinos, mainly journalists and salespeople, and I&apos;ve asked them why they wanted to leave their homeland. One immediate response is that they&apos;re sick of the endemic corruption; as one colleague remarked, if you come to Bangkok to avoid economic skulduggery, things must be pretty bloody awful at home. But a more deep-seated problem is the concentration of wealth and power among a few established families, meaning that bright people from humbler backgrounds have limited options for serious advancement. The hacks I meet are the lucky ones; the less educated become maids, construction workers and, yes, prostitutes; remittances to the Philippines from overseas workers still outstrip foreign direct investment into the country. Add to the mix a neo-colonial preference for pale skin, endemic throughout south-east Asia, and hostility and suspicion towards Chinese and Muslim minorities, and you&apos;ve got an inflexible social hierarchy where the underlings are expected to know their place, and the top dogs seem blissfully unaware of just how lucky they are.

The move comes as Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the former deputy prime minister, told a Thai newspaper that a military solution was the only way to solve the political crisis.  Sondhi Limthongkul, one of nine heads of the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (Pad), and six others were bailed for inciting unrest and illegal assembly after recent demonstrations in the capital, Bangkok. The charges carry between three and seven years in jail. &quot;Everything is done. There is no detention,&quot; Sondhi said. &quot;It is the final war. We cannot lose. If we lose, the country will be gone.&quot;  Pad is calling for sweeping electoral changes and trying to force the resignation of the new prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, whom it sees as a puppet of his brother-in-law, the deposed former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The reopening of Thailand&apos;s parliament on Tuesday saw the latest in a series of violent clashes between police and anti-government protesters, which left two people dead and more than 400 injured, including one police officer skewered on a flagpole.  Protesters also targeted police headquarters and set fire to cars. In a move that Somchai described as the &quot;international standard&quot;, police used teargas to clear a path for MPs. One protester lost his foot from a teargas grenade and a female demonstrator was killed. The seven men were originally charged with treason in August, the day after Pad protesters stormed a state television station and overran the prime minister&apos;s official compound, but the charge was quashed by the Thai court of appeals yesterday. The decision was seen as a major blow to the government and the police who were hoping to lessen Pad&apos;s power by weakening its leadership. The court also called for the authorities to use &quot;soft means&quot; to deal with demonstrations. It dismissed charges of insurrection, stockpiling of weapons and refusing to disperse. Two other Pad leaders who were arrested on charges of inciting unrest were freed yesterday. In a front-page interview with the Bangkok Post, Yongchaiyudh, the chief negotiator with Pad who resigned as deputy prime minister after the protests on Tuesday, said: &quot;After the military steps in, power should immediately be returned to the people and an interim government can be formed in which every party takes part.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-10-10T12:53:10Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Protest", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/10/bangkok-thailand-pad-protests", "title": "Bangkok protest leaders bailed after handing themselves in", "sentences": ["Sondhi Limthongkul, one of nine heads of the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (Pad), and six others were bailed for inciting unrest and illegal assembly after recent demonstrations in the capital, Bangkok.", "In a front-page interview with the Bangkok Post, Yongchaiyudh, the chief negotiator with Pad who resigned as deputy prime minister after the protests on Tuesday, said: &quot;After the military steps in, power should immediately be returned to the people and an interim government can be formed in which every party takes part.&quot;"]}, {"article": "&quot;Christianity reaches more people than healthcare,&quot; Stephen Waititi, a former church deacon and the medical director of Milmay Centre, an HIV/Aids clinic in Kampala, pointed out recently. What the churches say matters: not just because of their reach, but because of their authority. The message from the pulpit shapes the climate. The role of the church in the HIV/Aids epidemic is central. From the first recognition of the threat posed, above all, to the poor of the developing world, the churches have been at the forefront of the effort to provide care for the sick and to educate the healthy. The exception was the Christian evangelical movement, which by 2000 claimed not just the Ugandan president and his wife, Yoweri and Janet Museveni, but George W Bush, the president of the United States. Jerry Falwell, then the leading US televangelist, called Aids &quot;God&apos;s judgment on promiscuity&quot;, while senator Jesse Helms, a powerful Congressional ally of the evangelicals, argued against Aids funding for homosexuals because of their &quot;deliberate, disgusting, revolting acts&quot;. But, as Helen Epstein charts in her brilliant article in the New York Review of Books, the evangelical right soon saw that however morally reprehensible, HIV/Aids opened new avenues. &quot;It is true,&quot; wrote Ken Isaacs, of Samaritan&apos;s Purse, an evangelical charity run by Billy Graham&apos;s son, Franklin, &quot;that when we choose to act outside of God&apos;s mandate for sexual purity, we should be prepared to deal with the consequences. &quot;However,&quot; he went on, &quot;God calls Christians to tell others of the redeeming love of Christ and the eternal life they can have through him.&quot; And, with so many people on the verge of death, &quot;AIDS has created an evangelism opportunity for the body of Christ unlike any in history.&quot; The evangelical approach is now threatening Uganda&apos;s astonishing success in reining in HIV transmission. From the mid 1980s and the late 1990s, the number infected fell from an average of 17% of the population (and 30% in some urban areas) to little more than 6%. Academics, examining the phenomenon, pointed to the swift appreciation of Museveni of the challenge the country faced, the open and frank nature with which the epidemic was discussed and the extensive public education programme that was conducted in a non-judgmental tone in a wide range of mediums. But perhaps most important to the sense of urgency was the extent of the pandemic. HIV and Aids was affecting the whole country. Everyone knew someone, often in their own family, who was living with HIV or who had died from Aids. There was no room for doubt that something had to be done. By the end of the 1990s, Uganda was being held up as a shining example of what could be achieved. At about the same time, the evangelical wing of the Christian churches started to make rapid inroads among the faithful and the lapsed of Uganda&apos;s towns and villages. By some accounts, as many as half of Uganda&apos;s Christians are now &quot;born again&quot;.  Of all the messages about halting the spread of HIV and Aids, one particularly appealed to the evangelicals. &quot;As simple as ABC&quot;, declared the billboards, and Abstain, Be faithful and Condom use - simple and memorable - came to be singled out as the key to Uganda&apos;s unequalled success. A message that changing personal behaviour in line with the church&apos;s teaching brought salvation in this world was elevated and refined until, for young people, it became encapsulated in a single imprecation: Abstain. The person most identified with the message in Uganda is the president&apos;s wife, Janet. In 2003 she took the &quot;True Love Waits&quot; message to Washington in support of Bush&apos;s bid to Congress for $15bn of Aids funding. Although the great bulk of the funding was for the provision of antiretrovirals, $1bn was to support programmes promoting the message of abstinence - a message Bush was also encouraging to combat teen pregnancy in US schools. &quot;Religious organisations played a major role in prevention [of HIV/Aids] and had a strong influence,&quot; Janet Museveni told a Baptist conference in Washington DC. &quot;When we adopted the True Love Waits slogan, we found that the most important thing was focusing on our spiritual foundation and values.&quot; At the international Aids conference in Bangkok in 2004 the message was repeated by the Ugandan president, despite widespread criticism of the apparent downgrading of the importance of condom use, particularly in a country like Uganda that is in effect polygamous, and where women might abstain or be faithful, but with no confidence that their husbands will have done either. By 2006, the evangelical focus on abstinence was being challenged by other Christian churches, which recognised that the inequality of women made negotiating either abstinence or safe sex impractical. Supported by the African Network of Religious Leaders Living with Aids, a wider approach was devised, which included the core message of abstinence and fidelity, but in a non-hierarchical context. HIV is a disease, they argued, not a moral issue. SAVE (acronyms seem indispensable) stands for Safer sex, Available medication, Voluntary counselling and testing, and Empowerment and negotiation. In 2006, to strong criticism from the evangelicals, it was adopted by the charity Christian Aid. Beatrice Ware, a prominent Ugandan HIV campaigner, who has been infected with HIV by her husband, says: &quot;ABC stigmatises HIV positive women. It allows people to conclude that we are either promiscuous or unfaithful.&quot; Winnie Sseruma, a Ugandan who works for Christian Aid, says it also leaves children born with HIV in despair. &quot;How did I get it, they ask? They wonder what they did wrong.&quot; But evangelicals, like those in  Anglican Mainstream group, accuse Christian Aid of succumbing to political correctness. Not for the first time, the Christian churches find themselves torn between a compassionate approach and a strictly moral one. Sseruma believes it is not only the abstinence message promoted by evangelical Christians that is behind the halt in the fall of HIV transmission in Uganda. &quot;The evangelical churches distort the message around healing,&quot; she says. &quot;People take it to mean that prayer alone can heal, but it should be made clear that God can&apos;t do it alone. People must keep taking their medication.&quot; Most intractable is the fate of homosexual Africans, condemned by society in general and evangelicals in particular, unable to seek treatment and often compelled by peer pressure into marriage, ensuring the cycle of transmission is renewed. Sseruma fears that, encouraged by the evangelical churches, society is becoming less and less tolerant of those living with HIV. Individuals convicted of infecting someone can now be imprisoned. Soldiers are denied promotion. The open, non-judgmental approach to HIV education and treatment that saw such success in the 1990s is being progressively undermined in a politico-religious movement that is financially endorsed by Bush&apos;s Republicans.", "publicationDate": "2008-10-13T08:42:10Z", "tags": ["Uganda", "World news", "Religion", "Africa"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/katineblog/2008/oct/13/sexandreligion", "title": "Religion and sex in Uganda: The power of the pulpit's message", "sentences": ["&quot;When we adopted the True Love Waits slogan, we found that the most important thing was focusing on our spiritual foundation and values.&quot; At the international Aids conference in Bangkok in 2004 the message was repeated by the Ugandan president, despite widespread criticism of the apparent downgrading of the importance of condom use, particularly in a country like Uganda that is in effect polygamous, and where women might abstain or be faithful, but with no confidence that their husbands will have done either."]}, {"article": "Bearing in mind the imminent release of Oliver Stone&apos;s W., would I be right in assuming there is an entire alphabet of single-letter movie titles?Colin Marsh, Sutton Coldfield  Surprisingly, you&apos;d be wrong.

The Cambodian leader had vowed to turn the area into a &quot;death zone&quot; if Thailand failed to pull back its soldiers by noon, a threat Bangkok chose to ignore. Instead, it beefed up its forces and put jet fighters on standby along with C-130 transport aircraft ready to evacuate Thais living in the border area if the tensions escalated further.

Every year more than 800 million international travellers fail to undergo &quot;the most basic scrutiny&quot; to check whether their identity documents have been stolen, the global policing cooperation body has warned.  Senior figures want a system that lets immigration officials capture digital images of passengers and immediately cross-check them against a database of pictures of terror suspects, international criminals and fugitives. The UK&apos;s first automated face recognition gates - matching passengers to their digital image in the latest generation of passports - began operating at Manchester airport in August. Mark Branchflower, head of Interpol&apos;s fingerprint unit, will this week unveil proposals in London for the creation of biometric identification systems that could be linked to such immigration checks.  The civil liberties group No2ID, which campaigns against identity cards, expressed alarm at the plans.  &quot;This is a move away from seeking specific persons to GCHQ-style bulk interception of information,&quot; warned spokesman Michael Parker.  &quot;There&apos;s already a fair amount of information collected in terms of passenger records. This is the next step. Law enforcement agencies want the most efficient systems but there has to be a balance between security and privacy.&quot; The growth of international criminal gangs and the spread of terrorist threats has increased demand for Interpol&apos;s services.  Last year it carried out 10,000 fingerprint searches; this year the figure will reach 20,000.  An automated fingerprint identification system with far greater capacity, known as Metamorpho, will be installed next year. Earlier this month Interpol launched its &quot;global security initiative&quot; aimed at raising $1bn (\u00a3577m) to strengthen its law enforcement programmes. It claims to hold the &quot;names and identifiers&quot; of 9,000 terrorist suspects. Branchflower will speak at the opening of the Biometrics 2008 conference in Westminster about the possibility of extending its biometric database.  Before the conference he said that Interpol wanted to create a face recognition database, to match its fingerprint and DNA records, that could be searched and matched automatically.  &quot;Facial recognition is a step we could go to quite quickly,&quot; said Branchflower, &quot;and it&apos;s increasingly of use to [all] countries. There&apos;s so much data we have but they are in records we can&apos;t search.&quot; If Interpol had been operating a face recognition database linked to national border controls last autumn, he said, it might have picked up a Canadian teacher wanted for child abuse as he entered Thailand.

Thaksin, the first Thai prime minister to be convicted of corruption committed while in office, was found to have violated conflict of interest rules in helping his wife to buy land from a state agency at a reduced price.  Thaksin, who was forced out in a bloodless coup in 2006, has been accused of a number of corruption offences that he maintains are politically motivated.  The supreme court convicted Thaksin, 59, by a majority of five to four but cleared him of more serious charges of abuse of power to obtain the land.  The case centred on a 5.3 hectare (13 -acre) plot of land that Thaksin&apos;s wife Pojaman bought from a state financial institution for \u00a312.9m, a third of its estimated value, two years after Thaksin became prime minister in 2001. The panel ruled seven to two to acquit Pojaman, 51, of all the charges in connection with the land purchase, though she was sentenced to three years&apos; jail in July for tax evasion in a separate case. Thaksin dismissed the case as part of a plot against him. &quot;I&apos;m a politician and after I was toppled by the coup it&apos;s normal that they will try every means to justify it,&quot; he said. &quot;They don&apos;t use the rule of the law as evidence, they follow the politics.&quot; Prosecutors said they would file a formal extradition request with the UK to bring Thaksin back to Thailand to serve his sentence and face other charges.

The surprise was that the supreme court had allowed Thaksin and his wife Potjaman to leave the country in the first place. They were bailed on the pretext that they should attend the opening of the Olympics in Beijing, but they flew to London instead where they have been ever since. At the time, it was speculated that the couple had been given the nod to flee into exile in the hope of ending the political crisis. But the crisis continues. Thaksin&apos;s second stand-in as prime minister, his brother-in-law Somchai Wongsawat, is in as much trouble as his predecessor, Samak Sundaravej, who was sacked for moonlighting as a television chef. In the four weeks since he was sworn in, Somchai has been unable to enter his office, which is occupied by opposition supporters, and has been forced to climb over fences to escape protesters. Yesterday he fled an angry crowd who threw shoes and water bottles at him while shouting &quot;murderer&quot; - and they were state workers. If the rule of law were to be upheld, Britain should extradite Thaksin and his wife back to Thailand, the opposition should release its stranglehold on government and Samak should call fresh elections. But none of the likely outcomes are particularly appealing. Behind Thailand&apos;s violent political crisis lies a deeply entrenched power battle between an urban royalist and liberal elite, represented by the opposition, the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD), and the rural poor, championed by Thaksin&apos;s People Power Party (PPP). Both claim to represent the popular will -and each time an election is held Thaksin&apos;s party wins - but neither are democratic. PAD want a parliament that is 70% appointed and 30% elected, but a return of Thaksin is also troubling. He earned his popularity in the north and north-east of the country with low-cost healthcare and village development funds, but the populist tycoon has no legitimacy to rule while he has a case to answer before a court of law. The more violent PAD demonstrations become, the easier it will be for Thaksin to claim before a British court that the charges against him are politically motivated. Calling another election would also do little to alter the underlying dynamic, as a new government would inevitably contain pro-Thaksin factions. But allowing the violence to escalate would only create the conditions for another military coup. There have been 10 of them since 1932.

Mushtaq will be based at the national performance centre at Loughborough and will coach England players of all levels, but it is his relationship with England&apos;s senior spinner, Monty Panesar, that will attract most attention. Panesar&apos;s progress has slowed since his introduction to the Test scene and the perception that, for all his discipline and accuracy, he is a mechanical bowler who lacks imagination has become encapsulated by Shane Warne&apos;s observation that &quot;he has not played 33 Tests, but the same Test 33 times.&quot;  The England and Wales Cricket Board has yet to announce whether Mushtaq will join Panesar in Sri Lanka, where the Northants&apos; left-arm spinner will spend three weeks next month before England&apos;s two Tests in India. Since exploratory discussions with England&apos;s coach, Peter Moores, during his retirement celebration for Sussex at the end of last season, Mushtaq had been undecided whether to work with England or his native Pakistan, where he has been an assistant coach. He has opted for England, now that the thorny issue of his involvement with the Lahore Badshahs, members of the rogue ICL Twenty20 competition, has been addressed. The ECB stressed yesterday that Mushtaq will &quot;be taking appropriate steps to sever his ties with the Indian Cricket League&quot;. Hugh Morris, the ECB&apos;s managing director, said: &quot;It&apos;s critical that we nurture and develop the next generation of England spin bowlers using the expertise and knowledge of former players such as Mushtaq. Spin has been integral to the success of the world&apos;s best cricket teams and we are keen to ensure that there is a constant flow of spin-bowling talent into the England set-up.&quot; Mushtaq, 38, last played for Pakistan in 2003, the year that his 103 wickets for Sussex helped them to their first championship. He was their leading wicket-taker for four seasons in a row, a run of success that helped to establish Moores&apos; reputation at Sussex as one of England&apos;s brightest coaches. The ECB chairman, Giles Clarke, meanwhile rubbished claims made on the Indian TV channel CNN-IBN last night that England players were unlikely to take part in next spring&apos;s Indian Premier League after a stand-off between the ECB and Indian administrators. The report suggested the IPL had refused the ECB&apos;s stipulation on a reciprocal deal, namely that Indian players should be free to play in England&apos;s own Premier League Twenty20 competition when it launches in 2010. Clarke said: &quot;I&apos;m flabbergasted by the very suggestion. Discussions are still ongoing on many aspects of Twenty20 cricket. We had very friendly discussions with Indian representatives in Dubai last week and these are continuing.&quot; The announcement this week that Lancashire had signed VVS Laxman as an overseas professional for next season suggests that the Indian board&apos;s instructions that its players should not take part in county cricket have been watered down. One man who might soon feel the full weight of Indian power, however, is the chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket, Arjuna Ranatunga. A Sri Lankan delegation met IPL officials in Bangkok at the weekend with the hope of finalising a $40m [\u00a324m] deal to commit their players to the IPL for the next 10 years but that agreement has yet to be confirmed. That has led to speculation that the IPL&apos;s chairman, Lalit Modi, wants Ranatunga&apos;s removal before ratifying a deal discussed with the Sri Lankan players&apos; representative, Graeme Labrooy.

This is the new economic powerhouse. Its growth may slow a little while the West flounders, but it will emerge from this recession as the world&apos;s centre of economic and financial gravity. Goodbye, USA. Hello, the Chinese Communist party. It is fashionable foolishness that ignores some brute realities. The first is that Asia, except Japan, remains in essence a subcontractor to the West. Two-thirds of China&apos;s exports, for example, are made by foreign companies who essentially reprocess imports of semi-manufactured goods that are then shipped to Europe and the US. It is an economy that does not innovate - it is the great copier and counterfeiter of Western technology. This may change over the next 200 years, but not during the lifetime of most of the people reading this column. It is true there are Asian hot spots. South Korea is following Japan&apos;s lead, while India, whose foreign trade is smaller than Spain&apos;s, has promising companies and dynamic cities. Then there are Hong Kong, Singapore and Bangkok. But poverty, illiteracy, sexism and caste still dominate. The notion that mainland Asia is about to supplant the US, EU and Japan in the near future is risible.  Nor is Asia set to prop up the shattered Western economy. This is the other fashionable notion peddled until recently. Asia is now so strong and independent of the West, ran the argument, that it has &apos;decoupled&apos;. It would carry on spending and producing, so partly underwriting the world economy and ameliorate the worst of the coming recession. Asia&apos;s terrified financial markets, coming to terms with their region&apos;s vulnerability, are now testimony to this profound misunderstanding. Asia is an exporter and saver, of which the best example is China. It consumes a smaller proportion of GDP than it saves, with total consumption lower than Italy&apos;s. If its exports stagnate, as they have with the rise of the renminbi against the dollar and the slowing of American spending, then its economy slows down. The rate of growth has dropped by a quarter over the last 12 months and there is every prospect of a further sizable drop over the next 12.  Nor can investment rise to fill the gap. China is saturated with ports, highways, steel mills, cement and petrochemical plants that operate at a fraction of capacity. As the realisation has grown that capacity has run far ahead of now falling demand, China&apos;s bubble economy has burst rather like our own. Its stock market has crashed and property prices are collapsing. The manufacturing heart in the Pearl River area near Hong Kong is being destroyed. Half the 2,200 factories in the shoe industry have shut, as have a third of the 3,600 toy factories.  China&apos;s ever-growing demand for raw materials is easing. Although the Chinese government says its sheltered banking system is insulated from problems in the West, last week top Chinese investment firm CITIC reported a $2bn loss from taking &apos;unauthorised&apos; positions in the derivatives markets. China&apos;s banking system is a house of cards, with billions of dollars of toxic loans made at the party&apos;s request to loss-making enterprises set against tiny amounts of core capital. Some unexpected losses and the results could make the West&apos;s financial crisis look tame. The party is acutely aware of the risk, lowering interest rates and considering a big boost in infrastructure spending. Outsiders seem perplexed at the alarm that growth may subside to 7 per cent next year; would that Britain and the West will be so lucky. But bear in mind two key facts. China managed to grow throughout the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution at nearly 5 per cent per annum. The bulk of the adult population still farms tiny plots of hopelessly unproductive land in grinding poverty. All it takes is a tiny fraction of its workers moving from doing nothing in the countryside to doing something in the towns deploying modern technology to produce growth. In these conditions, only 5 per cent growth is a crisis.  If 7 to 8 per cent growth is better, it will still not stave off a sharp increase in unemployment. Already there is an explosion of what the Chinese call &apos;incidents&apos; - social unrest. As the Ministry of Labour has warned, China needs to create jobs with sky-high growth rates if it is to retain social stability.  In which case it must change. It has to consume more and become more innovative and productive. But communism stands as a roadblock.  The party is considering an amazing concession - allowing peasants to be able to buy and sell long leases on their land. This would be the biggest step towards granting property rights to 730 million rural peasants since the Revolution. The reason? The party needs them to use their land as collateral to save less and spend more. It is political dynamite, removing one of the key props of the party&apos;s support - its control of villages and land rights. But it must be considered. China is beginning the perilous path to becoming freer because the economy demands it. Then there is innovation, where its track record is abominable. China accounts for only 0.1 per cent of the world&apos;s patents that apply in Japan, the EU and the US. Economists believe the invention of general-purpose technologies, like the internal combustion engine, internet or aeroplane, that have massive general application, holds the key to growth and will accelerate in the decades ahead. Not one of this century&apos;s general-purpose technologies will be made outside the West and Japan, which have held a monopoly for 300 years. Their lead will widen rather than narrow.  The Chinese government knows it must unblock control of universities, laboratories and business if China is to change this dismal prediction and create the subtle combination of freedom to experiment and incentives in which innovation flourishes. Meanwhile, the West&apos;s financial travails are not for ever. Once they are solved, the West will be back, exploiting its capacity to innovate. Authoritarian Asian capitalism is not about to triumph over the Western liberal variant. China needs to change profoundly if it is to join the first rank of nations as their equal. Meanwhile, don&apos;t look to it - or the rest of Asia - to soften recession. The West made this mess. It must clear it up itself.", "publicationDate": "2008-10-25T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["China", "Global economy", "World news", "Market turmoil", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/26/china-global-economy", "title": "Will Hutton: Don't expect China to get the West out of this financial mess", "sentences": ["Then there are Hong Kong, Singapore and Bangkok."]}, {"article": "ADAMS PARKS With the assembled guests laughing uproariously at unfunny anecdotes being told by a man seated at the top table wearing a flower in his lapel, a purple waistcoat and a garish tie with a big fat knot, the unveiling of Tony Adams as Portsmouth&apos;s new manager was more like a wedding reception than a press conference. &quot;I think it is my time, I think I am ready,&quot; brayed the best man, who is now in sole charge of grooming Portsmouth&apos;s defenders in the art of taking one step forward while simultaneously raising their arms and looking to the left. &quot;I spoke to Arsene [Wenger] last night for advice and he said &apos;welcome to hell&apos;,&quot; revealed Adams, prompting the kind of excessively raucous guffawing that has long been the soundtrack of the Premier League pressroom. &quot;I said &apos;are you scared?

The announcement surprised nobody who witnessed the Toon&apos;s sorry capitulation at rivals Sunderland on Saturday, for only when Barton came on did the team manage to string together one pass in a row. &quot;I am pleased he is back in the fray,&quot; continued Kinnear, ever his own man. &quot;I&apos;m hoping all the supporters will get behind him and support him,&quot; were his final words on the subject, and ones he might as well have not bothered uttering, seeing as football supporters these days are so sensitive and sanctimonious that even the sight of a man kissing the badge of the club he is employed by can result in a stand-full of little sizzling faces being cooled down by floods of tiny-tot tears. But even Kinnear is not so headstrong as to consider giving Barton the captain&apos;s armband. With Nicky Butt out of action due to ankle-knack and thigh-thwack, and Michael Owen having died about four years ago, the team needs a new on-pitch leader to shout loudly at them for 23 minutes before dropping his head like everyone else when the third goal is conceded. &quot;I have two great candidates in Shay Given and Steven Taylor,&quot; mused Kinnear, before talking himself out of 50% of his options. &quot;Nobody needs to tell me what Shay Given means to this football club, both on and off the field. To tell the truth, I have never had a goalkeeper as my captain in either my playing or managerial career.&quot; So Steven Taylor it is, then. &quot;He&apos;s a Geordie boy and it would mean a lot to him.&quot; Because kowtowing to blind regional pride has stood the club in such good stead over the years, hasn&apos;t it? Follow Newcastle United v West Brom in this minute-by-minute report from 7.45pm ********************* THE RUMOUR MILL Having valued Lassana Diarra at \u00a325m just a few months ago, &apos;Arry Redknapp will attempt to bring him to Tottenham for considerably less in January. Diarra isn&apos;t the only Portsmouth favourite wanted by Redknapp. The new Tottenham boss also wants that tattooed bloke with the top hat, blue wig and annoying bell to buy a season ticket for White Hart Lane and start supporting Spurs. Good news for Aston Villa fans! Homer Simpson look-alike Marlon Harewood will be shouting &quot;D&apos;oh!&quot; after missing sitters in the Championship for Stoke, West Brom or Wolves next season. And having shelled out more than \u00a3100,000 for a tig-tease in a Birmingham bongo bar last week, John Carew&apos;s woe could be exacerbated by the arrival of Kevin Doyle, Roque Santa Cruz or Mr Em at Villa Park. ********************* NEWS IN BRIEF Gareth Barry is donning a sarong, growing ridiculous dreadlocks and telling England&apos;s Brave John Terry and Rio Ferdinand how he knows this totally authentic place on the Khao San Road that&apos;s the real Thailand, yeah? The Thai FA claims England will play a friendly in Bangkok next year, though a helpful FA suit emailed Fiver Towers to say it ain&apos;t so. Internazionale striker Adriano has been dropped for Wednesday&apos;s game with Fiorentina after reports in Italy said he turned up late for training. &quot;I talked to the players that I had to talk to, I talked to the team,&quot; said Il Speciale. He actually said a bit more but we were five hours late back from lunch. If you&apos;re looking for obscure-teenage-signing news then you&apos;ve come to the right place: Reading have signed 18-year-old striker Michail Antonio from Tooting &amp; Mitcham United. And a Moroccan schoolboy has been jailed after replacing the name of the king with everyone&apos;s favourite Catalan giants. The boy changed the phrase &quot;God, The Nation, The King&quot; on the classroom blackboard to &quot;God, The Nation, Barcelona&quot;. &quot;He&apos;d have got off if he&apos;d written Sporting Gijon,&quot; said a humourless Moroccan suit. ********************* STILL WANT MORE? Jawohl! Raphael Honigstein ist mehr oder weniger Geschmacksache. A rich and impetuous Italian billionaire with lilac-tinted spectacles has upset Rich Man&apos;s Plaything fan Benjie Goodhart. Here&apos;s why. Don&apos;t be surprised if Dorinel Munteanu has lost his job as Steaua Bucharest manager by the time you read this column about his appointment by the club&apos;s rightwing and utterly unsavoury owner Gigi Becali yesterday, writes Jonathan Wilson. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is no angel either, writes Sid Lowe, who likens him to an evil dead bloke named Jesus instead. A column about football in the West Bank and Gaza? That James Montague must be linking the credit crunch to the woes of troubled Geordie genius Paul Gascoigne. ********************* FIVER LETTERS &quot;Can I be the 1,057th person to decry the Fiver for the recent absence of any patronising words regarding my chosen team, those barrel-scrapers-turned-star-gazers of Hull City? I request, nay demand, articles that use phrases such as &apos;plucky journeymen&apos;, &apos;playing out of their skins&apos;, &apos;bubble about to burst&apos; and &apos;sunbed-loving tactical magician&apos;, so that I can be as infuriated by your coverage of the Tigers as I am by everyone else&apos;s in the media. If you could imply that Phil Brown is probably just making it up as he goes along and getting lucky, that would also be great, then round it off by deploying the much-favoured London 0 Hull 4 motif soon&quot; - Mike Scott. &quot;While I find the phenomenon of badge-kissing slightly ludicrous in view of the fact that these days any player who spends more than two seasons at the same club earns the epithet &apos;stalwart&apos;, it is, I suppose, preferable to badger-kissing. As the great Irish Times stalwart Myles na cGopaleen pointed out, one of those fellas will have the face off you&quot; - Marco Bonfiglio. &quot;To Jason Tew and the 1,056 others who want the Fiver to nip all talk of Liverpool being title contenders in the bud (yesterday&apos;s Fiver letters). Please explain how a team that is top of the Premier League after nearly a quarter of the season should not be considered genuine contenders?&quot; - Paul Sims.

More than 100 MPs stormed out ahead of the vote, saying that &quot;while the bill&apos;s final version removed contentious clauses regulating dress and social behaviour&quot;, it went against the country&apos;s tradition of diversity. The final version focuses instead on the dissemination of material containing pornographic images, gestures or even conversations. Those who break the law face a fine or prison. Associated Press, Jakarta Eta suspected after bomb explodes at university A large car bomb exploded at the University of Navarra in Pamplona yesterday, wounding 17 people, and setting a building and cars on fire. There was no claim of responsibility but officials pointed the finger at the militant Basque separatist group Eta. They said the blast could have caused huge bloodshed because it went off in a busy part of the campus. Alfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba, interior minister, said: &quot;Whoever placed the bomb gave a warning and either intentionally did not give all the information or made a mistake.&quot; The blast follows the recent arrest of suspected Eta members in Pamplona. Associated Press, Madrid Internet firewall to block websites insulting to king Thailand is to build a national internet firewall to block websites deemed insulting to the monarchy. The move appears to be the result of pressure on the government from the military to stamp out criticism of King Bhumibol Adulyadej. The \u00a31m firewall will also enable the authorities to block terrorist or pornography websites. Last year the government blocked the YouTube website for weeks for hosting a clip showing a picture of the king with a pair of women&apos;s feet suspended above his head. In Thai culture feet are regarded as dirty and the lowest part of the body. Ian MacKinnon, Bangkok New train service starts in capital to ease traffic jams A new train service started this week in Baghdad in an attempt to ease congestion along its crowded streets. The service comes as public irritation is mounting over traffic jams. The clogged streets are the result of better security in the capital and the numerous police checkpoints that help stop bombers but also slow down cars and lorries. &quot;We have launched this train to ease congestion and traffic jams on Baghdad&apos;s streets,&quot; said Abdul-Ameer Hamoud, director of central transport.

Little has changed in 600 years: flagged floors, stone walls and heavy beams. Duck into the cosy darkness of this quirky bar to find low ceilings, a roaring fire, small booths and an old piano at the end of the room. Pretty bedrooms, all above, are a steal.

Volunteering Street kids, India The warm and fuzzy feeling you experience at Christmas usually comes from overdoing it on the mince pies and sherry, but there is another way. On a volunteer scheme in India, you&apos;ll work with street kids and tribal communities on the outskirts of Udaipur in Rajasthan, as a teaching assistant in rural schools. Hindi lessons, cultural workshops and an overnight train trip to Agra to see the Taj Mahal and all meals are included. \u2022 Global Vision International (01727 250 250, gvi.co.uk), two weeks from Dec 13, \u00a3795pp, excl flights. Elephant tracking, Kenya Tell the kids they&apos;re being sent to work for Christmas and they won&apos;t be impressed, but tell them the work will be in Africa, and involves tracking elephants, and new Wii games and stocking-fillers might suddenly sound dull in comparison. The work element of this two-week family trip to Kenya is pretty low weight, with three days camping and volunteering in the Mwaluganje Elephant Sanctuary sandwiched between game drives in Tsavo East national park, time on Indian Ocean beaches and bush walks near Mombasa. It&apos;s a group trip for up to 20 people and the volunteer work may involve clearing paths, monitoring elephants and maintenance. \u2022 Departs Dec 19.

A new supper club invites you to join Brooklyn creatives for a dinner party In the dark we make our way along the deserted streets, past giant warehouses and overflowing trash cans. We find the building we&apos;re looking for, enter the bare corridor, squeeze past someone&apos;s bicycle and knock on the unmarked door.  It&apos;s hard to believe, but this obscure, pre-gentrified corner of Brooklyn is at the cutting-edge of New York&apos;s foodie scene. This is the home of Whisk and Ladle, a secret supper club run by three hip twentysomethings from their Williamsburg loft apartment.  Mark, Danielle and Nick have turned their love of entertaining into one of the city&apos;s exclusive nights out, charging a select group of people $40 a head to dine in their apartment. It&apos;s an odd concept, and not one you can readily imagine taking off this side of the Atlantic - sounds a bit too much like you&apos;re paying to make friends. But in New York, supper clubs are the hottest thing since organic sliced bread, so much so, the night I visited Whisk and Ladle I found myself unwittingly starring in a TV documentary about the trio.  So, what&apos;s the attraction of dining in someone else&apos;s home in a city with 9,000 restaurants (in Manhattan alone) - enough to eat somewhere different every day for 25 years? The novelty value, stoopid. Young New Yorkers don&apos;t have dinner parties because they live in shoeboxes. The idea of an intimate supper with fellow artists, writers, photographers, filmmakers (most guests work in the media or arts, making this prime networking territory too) is fast catching on. Other hush-hush restaurants that you&apos;ll need detective skills to track down include Chez Fisha - hosted in a wine store in Fort Greene - and roving secret dinnerclub Coach Peaches.  Whisk and Ladle itself caters for about 20 at their fortnightly suppers - but they receive close to 100 enquiries, selecting their guests according to whether they&apos;ve sent an enthusiastic enough email. Pretentious? You bet. I overheard one girl at dinner screeching &quot;God, real conversation, is, like, so boring,&quot; but as a visitor, it&apos;s also a fun insight into the city. And though there is an undeniable whiff of exclusivity about it, Whisk and Ladle, says Mark, is the precise opposite of uppity New York dining. It&apos;s a bit chaotic, laid-back and about simple, home-cooked food. The apartment is undeniably funky - with the huge windows, bare brick wall, beamed ceiling you&apos;d expect in any former industrial space, but it&apos;s also very lived-in. A skateboard leans against the wall, a candelabra made of metal bunnies hangs over three tables pushed together and a cluster of mismatched chairs. The kitchen shelves are heaving with food processors, spices and pans, and in the middle of it all is the serene Danielle, still managing to look gorgeous while wearing a pinny and doling out soup.  As for the other guests, I sat with Amanda, editor of food blog eater.com and her boyfriend, a musician in a local band; and David, a playwright and his partner Erin, who works for an advertising agency. They were interesting and approachable and, of course, knowing New York like the backs of their hands, they proved an invaluable source of local titbits. (I made a note to check out Amanda&apos;s favourite, Motorino&apos;s pizzeria in Williamsburg, for its wood-fired ovens and bring-your-own policy). I loved the fact that Nick, who works in a bar in the Hamptons, had set up his own makeshift bar next to his bedroom from which he plied guests with delicious cocktails.  And the food? Well, this is a bunch of friends who like cooking, and that is reflected in the food - a starter of gazpacho was delicious; but the risotto that followed was disappointing. I wolfed down pudding (pancake with ganache and chocolate sauce). My wine glass practically overflowed with refills - a different wine for each course. And $40 for five-courses and plentiful drinks is not to be sniffed at in any city.

La Meuni\u00e8re, Lyon Leah Larkin, food writer for France Magazine Those looking for low-budget restaurants can&apos;t go wrong with Lyon&apos;s bouchons - small bistros serving tapas-style dishes. They offer a convivial atmosphere, owners and waiters are super-welcoming and diners sit elbow-to-elbow on shared tables. Vegetarians should be wary though, there&apos;s often a fair amount of tripe, as well as other kinds of meat not often found on British menus. At family-run La Meuni\u00e8re restaurant, I like the queue de boeuf mijot\u00e9e (beef tail in tomato and shallot sauce), but the menu changes all the time. Diners can help themselves to their entr\u00e9e at the traditional d\u00e9fil\u00e9 de saladiers, a long table laden with large bowls of eight or nine different salads. \u2022 11 rue Neuve (0033 4 78 28 62 91, la-meuniere.fr). Limon Rotisserie, San Francisco  Michael Bauer, food and wine editor, San Francisco Chronicle  The best deal these days is this Peruvian-inspired restaurant with small plates for around $9.25, including smaller portions of classics such as lomo saltado, and generous portions of ceviche, all with fat Peruvian corn. There&apos;s one main course: a marinated spit-roasted chicken; the flavours are excellent and so is the price - a whole chicken with two side dishes is only $15.95. Half is $9.50.  \u2022 1001 South Van Ness Ave (001 415 821 2134). Bar Melos, Madrid Arturo Mu\u00f1oz of lacuchara.es, a Madrid food blog Bar Melos is top rated by readers of my blog. We call it a bar de raciones because all the food is suitable for sharing with friends; to find the real essence of Madrid you have to visit one of these places, which are always full of Madrile\u00f1os. There are a few tables but most of us order food to eat standing up. A must have is the zapatilla (literally a slipper or trainer) - a huge sandwich made of grilled tetilla cheese from Galicia and lac\u00f3n (cured shoulder of pork) between slices of rustic bread. Glorious, and only \u20ac7. The croquetas are also brilliant. \u2022 Calle de Ave M\u00e1ria (0034 91 527 5054). Lin Heung Tea House, Hong Kong Josh Tse of food blog chaxiubao.typepad.com  My all-time fave is Lin Heung Tea House in Central, a boisterous stalwart over 80 years old with decor that hasn&apos;t changed in decades. It&apos;s always packed and vibrant. Go for the most time-honoured and authentic dim sum treats in town; you have to fight for your seat, and practically have to fight for your food too. The best dim sum are steamed buns with lotus seed paste; thousand-layer sponge cake with custard and sui mai with quail&apos;s egg. It costs around US$10 for a filling selection. \u2022 160-164 Wellington St (00852 2544 4556). Primo al Pigneto, Rome  Luca Zanini, food critic, Corriere della Sera Chef Marco Gallotta is one of three owners - all under 35 - of Primo al Pigneto in the small, scruffy eastern suburb of Pigneto. The restaurant is smart but homely: old furniture, low tables and a long bar serving tapas and appetisers. You can get the typical spaghetti cacao e pepe (half parmesan, half pecorino cheese, lots of black pepper), followed by veal meatballs with cinnamon, celery and tomato, together with a glass of wine for \u20ac30. An even better bargain is \u20ac25 for octopus, potato and cherry tomato salad and a fresh egg pasta tonnarelli with scorpion fish, tomatoes, olives and capers. Don&apos;t miss the linguine with brothy clams (seasonal only), with rolls of swordfish stuffed with broccoli and toma cheese. \u2022 Via del Pigneto 46 (0039 067 013 827, primoalpigneto.it). Lau&apos;s Family Kitchen, Melbourne Rita Erlich, food writer for the Age The Lau family is well known: father Gilbert owned The Flower Drum, for years considered the best restaurant in Australia. His sons run this place, which is very different in style. It&apos;s a second generation restaurant, confident enough to go back to roots, but in an Australian context. The setting is casual, downbeat stylish (panels, screens, fabric), with dim lighting. The wine list is restrained, the food makes people smile. Try the tofu dishes, or any of the braised meats, especially the braised brisket. Main courses $21-$33. \u2022 4 Acland St, St Kilda (0061 3 8598 9880, lausfamilykitchen.com.au). Jay Fai, Bangkok  Ung-Aang Talay food critic of the Bangkok Post What makes culinary exploring in Bangkok so rewarding is that the best food is served not in elegantly decorated restaurants, but in simple, family-run shops where private recipes have been perfected over decades. It would be easy to walk right past Jay Fai without noticing it; it looks like a standard noodle shop, open to the street with functional tables and chairs and no air-con, but the cooking, done by Jay Fai herself, ranks with the finest in the city. Order the drunken noodles - spicy, with Thai basil.  \u2022 327 Mahachai Rd (0066 2 223 9384), open 3pm-2am, closed Sat. Riad Monceau, Marrakech Chase Gilbert, editor of Last Exit, Morocco&apos;s English language paper For a local but refined take on the traditional Moroccan feast, head to Riad Monceau, a gourmet restaurant three minutes from Djemaa El Fna. The Moroccan salads, thick harira soup, a savory and sweet tajine of slow-cooked lamb with dates or chicken with fresh, local olives, and a light cream pastilla are fantastic. Finish it off with mint tea, and orange slices with cinnamon. The taster menu is \u00a326pp, but a main dish is much cheaper. \u2022 7/8 Derb Chaabane, Riad Zitoun Lakdim (00212 24 42 96 46, riad-monceau-restaurant.com). Bentley&apos;s, Dublin Paolo Tullio of foodandwine.net Not many Dublin restaurants have main courses under \u20ac20, but there are a few.

Prosecutors in Thailand  have been pushing to have Thaksin, who until recently owned Manchester City football club, extradited from Britain. Last month he was  sentenced in Bangkok in absentia to two years&apos; imprisonment for corruption over the purchase of land by his wife while he was prime minister.  Following reports in the press, Thai foreign ministry spokesman Thoni Thong Phakdi told reporters: &quot;The foreign ministry has checked the reports with British authorities and they have confirmed that the visas were revoked.&quot; He did not know the reason for the visa withdrawal, and the British embassy in Bangkok has declined to comment.

It&apos;s a pity Roy Jones Jr couldn&apos;t shave a few years off for this fight \u2013 well actually, 15 years to be honest. He reminds me of Oasis, full of bluster in 2008, but with his biggest hits belonging way back in the mid-1990s. But when Roy Jones Jr was good, he was unstoppable.  The punch that floored the undefeated IBF super-middleweight champion James &apos;Lights Out&apos; Toney at the beginning of the third round in 1994 was like a bolt from the blue. It also announced him onto the world scene. And if anybody still needed convincing of his class, four months later, he knocked out Antoine Byrd in the first round with rare skill and raw power to defend the title.  Despite a disqualification defeat to Montell Griffin in 1997, Jones Jr dominated at both super-middleweight and then light-heavyweight through the late 1990s until his fading star burnt out with three defeats in a row in 2004-05 \u2013 two to Antonio Carver and one to Glen Johnson. These defeats, two knockouts and a points loss, effectively put an end to his reputation as a serious prospect. Now aged 39, and lacking the incredible speed in the ring that used to be his trademark, Jones Jr will have to draw on all his experience and ring craft to score a victory against Calzaghe. At the weigh-in he looked enormous, so perhaps he&apos;s hoping to conserve his energy and, like Bernard Hopkins displayed with some success, attack the Welshman sparingly, but with great power.  As for the unbeaten Joe Calzaghe, he has maintained a high level throughout his career. People first stood up and took note of his talent 11 years ago when he beat a below-par, but still dangerous, Chris Eubank over 12 rounds. He has grown into himself as a boxer in the years since, recovering from his first ever knockdown against big-hitting Byron Mitchell in 2003, to annihilate his opponent with  a deadly assault of 26 unanswered punches to claim victory just a little over a minute after tasting the canvas himself.  If the bout with Mitchell was evidence of Calzaghe&apos;s burning pride, his clash with Kenya&apos;s Evans Ashira in 2005, proved he had the heart and skill worthy of an undefeated champion. After breaking his left hand early in the third round, Calzaghe fought on for nine rounds with only his rapid right jab to win a unanimous points victory. This rare ability to fling out countless jabs, thus giving his opponents no let-up, has served him well over the years and came to the fore in career-defining points wins against the heavily fancied  Jeff Lacy  and the hard-as-nails Dane Mikkel Kessler, whom Calzaghe defeated to unify the WBA, WBO and WBC super-middleweight titles.  Calzaghe&apos;s biggest weakness could be a feeling within himself that he should have perhaps hung up his gloves after his brilliant win against Kessler. At light-heavyweight against the aged but crafty Hopkins, Calzaghe looked like he was winding down as he struggled to get inside the American. Thanks to a desperate flurry of punches late in the fight he won narrowly, and some would say fortuitously, on a split decision. I can&apos;t see that he will show any such complacency in his final ever fight this morning, but there is just enough doubt lingering around Calzaghe&apos;s brittle hands for me to believe that he&apos;ll have to go the full 12 rounds to end his career with a perfect record.  Right, I&apos;m back and fully loaded on coffee. In the pre-fight build-up Calzaghe has already intimated that he might continue fighting after tonight. &quot;This is probably my last fight,&quot; he said, much to the chagrin of his concermned mother I presume.  Here are some of your pre-fight emails: &quot;This reminds me a lot of the Lewis vs Tyson fight,&quot; says Chay in Chorleywood. &quot;A good British boxer who&apos;s not really had many decent opponents to face during their prime, and wants to be seen to beat a big name who was once one of boxing&apos;s best ever. And just like Lewis, Calzaghe will systematically take Jones apart until he can&apos;t take anymore. Maybe 6-8 rounds.&quot; Jeff Lacy was no mug Chay and Kessler gave Calzaghe one hell of a fight, but I agree that Calzaghe never got involved with the big names like Roy Jones Jr and Bernard Hopkins when they were at their best, and I doubt he&apos;d have been up to their level in the mid to late 90s.  &quot;I&apos;m Welsh and living in Los Angeles,&quot; says Michael Aston. My brother lives in LA Michael, say hello if you see him. He&apos;s got dark hair and - oh never mind... Continue. &quot;I want Roy to win this one. He is a most noble man and a truly great champion. The Italian/Welsh boy will have the greatest lesson there is: humility and respect.&quot; Interesting Michael. Doesn&apos;t Jones Jr cross the border to go dog-fighting in Mexico? Not much nobility in that. But anyway, an interesting switch of allegiances. I&apos;m not sure Tom Jones would be too thrilled with you backing Jones Jr though.  The Observer&apos;s Kevin Mitchell is at ringside and here is his scene-setter: All week, the word has been that the Garden would be half-full for this fight - but, whether or not the gate was papered over by complimentaries, it isn&apos;t a bad turn-out. And most of the singing, of course, has a Welsh lilt. The bars around the famous old barn have been heaving for hours. Calzaghe has been a 3-1 on betting favourite with most odds-makers, Jones a 3-1 outsider. However, early 50-1 odds on a draw have been cut to 20-1 now punters have seen the value there. So far there has been nothing on the undercard that you would remember for long, apart, maybe, from the performance of Emanuel Augustus, who is 33 and has been boxing since 1994. He hip-hopped, he shimmied and he banged as best he could, smiling all the time at his considerably younger opponent, Francisco Figueroa. None of which prevented his posting the 30th defeat of his 72-fight career. They never give it to the old guy if it&apos;s close. The celeb count isn&apos;t extraordinary, although Lennox Lewis got a good cheer as he strolled to his seat. Mikkel Kessler, who gave Joe his toughest fight, is at ringside, as is Bernard Hopkins, still angling for a rematch with whoever wins the main event. That won&apos;t happen.  More emails: &quot;Is this an exhibition match?&quot; barks Derek Talbot. &quot;We have one of the best pound-for-pound fighters ever reducing himself at 39 to fighting a slap/box boxer who always chooses the easy fight. Big deal if Calzaghe wins. He&apos;s won no respect regardless.&quot; It does have that Harlem Globetrotters feel in which names are used to sell meaningless contests. Let&apos;s hope Jones Jr has something left in the tank to make this mean something.  &quot;Hopkins is sticking by his prediction of a win for Jones Jr,&quot; says Kevin Mitchell, ringside in New York. As Calzaghe&apos;s last opponent I suppose Bernard Hopkins knows better than most how to give the Welshman a rough time, but surely a Jones win is a tall order.  The final fight on the undercard is still ongoing so we&apos;ve a while longer to wait before the main event gets underway. Meanwhile your predictions keep coming.  &quot;Jones before round eight is a worry,&quot; says Laurance Langdon. &quot;But Joe over the 12, thanks to his sheer work ethic.&quot; &quot;Having hopefully sneaked the fight on some illicit broadband network I&apos;m determined to stay awake,&quot; says tinternet criminal Paul Woods. &quot;I think Jones will knock Calzaghe down in the first couple of rounds but fancy Calzaghe to win the bout, assuming he gets back up again. I expect Jones to unload a few bombs from the outset and &apos;check the chin&apos; of Calzaghe. Calzaghe also has an unhealthy prediliction for standing toe to toe against stronger opponents which could find him out. I won some money on Samuel Eto&apos;o earlier and it&apos;s all going on a Calzaghe knock down, and Calzaghe on points.&quot; Illegal Internet sites, gambling, and staying up late? You live life on the edge Mr Woods.  &quot;Almost all boxers go on too long (some twice or thrice) - isn&apos;t this a fight to decide which is guilty of this inevitable hubris?&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;Because on that reasoning, Calzaghe should cruise it.&quot; All boxers are spurred on by pride and I can&apos;t blame somebody like Jones Jr wanting to restore some of his by taking on an undefeated fighter. It reminds me somewhat of a gambler who is losing heavily and tries desperately to win back his stake by going for broke. If he loses, his reputation lies ever more in tatters, if he wins, well he&apos;s either back in the game, or he can retire content.  4.22am: The final fight before the main event plods on. It&apos;s in round nine so hopefully not too long to go. Jones Jr had a bunch of cronies whoopin&apos; an&apos; a hollerin&apos; as he shadow boxed in preparation in his dressing room. Calzaghe looked ultra-relaxed. In fact, he looked a little too at ease - he ought to get pysched just a wee bit in my opinion.  Meanwhile, back in my inbox: &quot;I&apos;m stuck in Bangkok with no access to a TV with the fight on it,&quot; laments Ronn McMillan. &quot;I recall watching Jones Jr&apos;s finest/unfinest hour, when at the Seoul Olympics in 1988 he won his final easily, then had the gold medal handed to his Korean opponent. The Koreans were never too subtle when it came to cheating. I rate Calzaghe though, and want tonight to be his night. Go for it Joe.&quot; I might just add that it was Ron McMillan who intimated Koreans are fond of cheating, not me.  We&apos;re just about ready to rumble! But while the razmattazz builds up here&apos;s Laurance Langdon with career advice for Jones Jr and Calzaghe. &quot;Both of these guys are finishing on this fight, no matter what Jones may say. If Jones wins, his claim for the best of all time is cemented, if Calzaghe wins he can go out saying he beat them all, despite some being past their prime. It&apos;s a legacy fight, and a massive pay day to boot. It&apos;s freezing in Atyrau [Kazakhstan], so we need some excitement to warm us up.&quot;  Build-up: Jones Jr enters the ring wearing an orange hoody and looking particularly moody. He&apos;s greeted by a mixture of boos from the travelling Welsh support and cheers from the home crowd.  Calzaghe looks cock-sure in a ridiculous sequin vest. Not the best choice of attire for what is probably your final fight. Not that it matters if he wipes the floor with Jones Jr.  The national anthems are blasted out into Madison Square Garden. The ginger American woman wins the sing-off in my opinion. She empties her lungs with much more vigour than did the Welsh singer. Maybe that&apos;s an omen.  The orange tanned PA gives it his all as he presents the fighters. It takes him about five minutes to list all of Jones Jr&apos;s achievements. Calzaghe grins as he is presented as undefeated. He punches the air and we&apos;re ready to RUMBLE!  Ding ding! Round one: Calzaghe throws out his jab very early on and pins Jones Jr against the ropes and works at his body. Jones appears to weigh up his opponent and throws a rapid left hook in the centre of the ring. It doesn&apos;t connect but it acts as a warning. They both trade punches in the corner. Calzaghe works a neat combination into Jones&apos; body... then Calzaghe goes down! Amazing! After a quiet start Jones lands an straight left to floor Calzaghe in much the same way Hopkins did with his right in the first round. Calzaghe gets up gingerly and throws out some wild punches and manages to survive. What a start! My score: Calzaghe 8-10 Jones Jr  Round two: Calzaghe is the aggressor early in this round. Jones sucks it all up and waits like a coiled cobra to attack. The Welshman doesn&apos;t allow him too though as he throws Jones onto the ropes and follows up with a flurry of punches to score points with the judges. Jones sticks out his tongue as if to say &apos;you didn&apos;t hurt me&apos; but in my book Calzaghe won that round. This fight has been anything but a meaningless exhibition - in large part thanks to Jones, who looks much more youthful than 39. My score: Calzaghe 10-9 Jones Jr  Round three: Calzaghe flies out with intent and looks more spritely on his feet than he has in any other round. He pins Jones back into the corner and works Jones&apos;s body before landing a big right hand over the top. He grins as he dances into the centre of the ring and goes toe-to-toe with Jones, who has nothing in reply. This is much better from the Newbridge southpaw. He must have landed four times as many punches as Jones in this round and many have connected too. Calzaghe struts on the bell and wiggles his hips at his opponent who doesn&apos;t like that one bit. The bell goes and Calzaghe will regret showboating if he is dumped on his behind again.My score: Calzaghe 10-9 Jones Jr  Round four: This fight is echoing the Hopkins battle. Calzaghe is playing catch-up. Jones doesn&apos;t have the water-tight guard of Hopkins though and I expect him to have to take a few more on the chin than Hopkins did. Calzaghe ought to be careful not to pose too much though as one rapier-like punch from Jones will floor him. Jones does catch Calzaghe with two clean jabs towards the end of the round, but the Welshman laughs them off just before the bell calls time. Calzaghe&apos;s work rate wins him the round though. My score: Calzaghe 10-9 Jones Jr  Round five:  Jones takes the pace out of the fight, by allowing Calzaghe to back him into the corner. Calzaghe characteristically lands a machine gun-like flurry of punches in the corner but Jones covers up well. Calzaghe steps up the pace and lands through Jones&apos; guard and shakes the American. Right up to the bell the two of them trade punches. Calzaghe continues to land more blows but Jones always connects with the more accurate powerful shots. My score: Calzaghe 10-9 Jones  Round six: &quot;Slightly worrying how confident Joe is putting his unprotected face in Jones&apos;s all the time,&quot; says Alex Hughes. &quot;He looks great though. Either another Lacy performance or he&apos;ll look very stupid flat on his back. Don&apos;t want to take the mickey too much with someone of Jones&apos;s calibre.&quot; Agreed Alex. Enzo Calzaghe reckons Jones will run out of steam. He may do but while he is standing he is a great threat. Calzaghe continues to put in the work to the body with his combinations. Jones invites Calzaghe onto him and then lands a terrific uppercut. Calzaghe responds well in the corner but Calzaghe&apos;s chin must be wobbling after that. My score: Calzaghe 9-10 Jones Jr  Round seven: Jones Jr has already proved his doubters wrong with his performance so far. He looks like he has got a second wind and manages to stay up as Calzaghe lands a crushing left hand midway through the round which sends Jones crashing onto the ropes. Calzaghe pounces on the opportunity and lands a straight left hand which gouges a cut above Jones Jr&apos;s left eye. The American survives but he is left with blood all over his upper body. That was a great round for Calzaghe.My score: Calzaghe 10-9 Jones Jr  Round eight: &quot;Joe leading comfortably after six rounds,&quot; says the Observer&apos;s Kevin Mitchell at ringside. &quot;Five rounds to one, through sheer volume of punches, after coming through a nasty first-round knockdown, which he dropped 10-8. Pace relentless. Calzaghe super confident and Jones bemused by the number and quality of Joe&apos;s combinations.&quot; That&apos;s the ringside view. Meanwhile Jones has been shaken by that cut. He looks a mess with blood gushing from his eye. Calzaghe is like a predator playing with his injured prey. Jones can&apos;t see and Calzaghe continues to pound him with a relentless stream of shots. Jones bats him off with an uppercut but Calzaghe forces Jones to cling on until the bell. The doctor has got much work to do to clean Jones&apos;s cut up so he can continue. My score: Calzaghe 10-9 Jones Jr  Round nine: There&apos;s a delay as Jones has his cut worked on. A replay from the last round shows a left hand from Calzaghe tearing across the cut. It&apos;s enough to make me wince never mind Jones. The American dances around and manages to limit the damage in the early exchanges in this round. Calzaghe seems content to hold off and wait for an opportunity to connect. He goads Jones - somewhat disrespectfully I feel - by sticking his chin out at his wounded opponent, who thankfully gives Calzaghe a jab to the mush. Calzaghe has it on points now and only has to see this one home. Jones has to do something special through one eye.My score: Calzaghe 10-9 Jones Jr  Round 10: Mercifully for Jones, the pace has dropped. He clings onto Calzaghe, who backs off and lands some crunching blows to Jones&apos;s ribs. The American legend is showing tremendous bottle. The whole left hand side of his face is crimson with blood. The fight should be stopped in my opinion. Jones survives another round. Calzaghe could be more ruthless and finish this but perhaps he&apos;s trying to lengthen his career. My score: Calzaghe 10-9 Jones Jr  Round 11: There&apos;s another delay as Jones has a lot of first aid work on his eye. Calzaghe immediately homes in on the cut with his right hand, but Jones Jr connects with a single accurate left. Calzaghe lands a solid right jab which Jones bizarrely acknowledges by saying &quot;good shot Joe.&quot; Calzaghe showboats again and... again gets his just deserts as Jones swings a right hook his way and connects. I&apos;ll score the round as a draw for Jones&apos;s sheer bravery.My score: Calzaghe 10-10 Jones Jr  Round 12: There&apos;s a standing ovation as these two legends of boxing, who may never fight again, touch gloves for the final round. It&apos;s been a gruelling fight and a great spectacle. Calzaghe crouches low and invites Jones onto him. With his trademark lunge Jones almost dizzies Calzaghe with a crashing right which just grazes his ear. Calzaghe skips on the spot to prove how much he has left in the tank, but in my opinion he should fuel a couple of punches and try to down Jones instead. Like a bloodied warrior Jones has one final lunge at Calzaghe which misses and as the bell sounds the two fighters embrace.My score: Calzaghe 10-10 Jones Jr  My result: A quick tot up of my scores puts it at Calzaghe 117-113 Jones Jr  The judges&apos; result: All three have it at Calzaghe 118-109 Jones Jr  Joe Calzaghe wins comfortably after a shaky start. For his sake it&apos;s a blessing that he has an iron chin because he needed it after being floored midway through the first round.  Post-fight musings: &quot;I won&apos;t make my final decision yet,&quot; says Calzaghe when asked about his future. &quot;I&apos;ll go home and think about it.&quot; I think that&apos;s a clue that Calzaghe will have one last &apos;last&apos; fight. The PA suggests Chad Dawson. We&apos;ll have to wait and see who he will face if he does decide to continue boxing. After tonight&apos;s performance I hope he does.

What is certain is that the waterway was contaminated with factory waste and swarming with mosquitoes until the late 80s. After government efforts to clean up and revive the area, young entrepreneurs and designers from nearby fashion district Daikanyama decided to take advantage of the convenient location and low rents. Nakameguro has been picking up commercially since the mid-90s, and has recently gained attention from Tokyo&apos;s coolest artists, musicians, and designers. Too much attention for some.

En route we are spending two and a half days in Tokyo. We want to get a real taste of the city and what it has to offer. I&apos;d be interested to hear your recommendations on whether we should sign up for a guided tour to get our bearings and see some of the key attractions and landmarks or go it alone. I prefer to explore cities independently but with the limited time available maybe a half-day or day tour is the best way to see the city? Can you recommend some tour guides or should we just strike out independently?Dave Runacres, by email A Tokyo can initially confuse visitors but no more than any other big city. Signage is generally in English as well as Japanese and getting around by metro is straightforward. The city is best explored as a series of neighbourhoods - colourful Asakusa, pictured above, the shopping districts of Shinjuku and Shibuya, and the cultural attractions of Ueno. If you&apos;ve explored other cities independently, then there&apos;s no need to grab a tour here.

I like to stop over in each direction, but have no desire to make the stop in Dubai or North America.  I also hate Heathrow. Ideally, I would look for flights from a European hub with stops in Asia, buying a separate ticket from Glasgow to Europe and having a short stopover in Europe. However, I have repeatedly been told this is impossible, as the onward flight has to be with the same airline as that leaving the UK - so even flying KLM via Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur, I cannot stop over in Amsterdam. Is there any way round this, short of taking a separate trip to Europe, and booking my ticket there? Could it be done online or by phone? I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m the only person who would prefer to start a long-haul flight from Europe. Is there a good reason for what looks like protectionism, or am I just ignorant about how to achieve what I want?Helen Owen, by email A UK agents can only sell discounted tickets that originate in the UK. They can sell tickets originating overseas but at &apos;full published fares&apos;, which will be considerably higher. So planning an itinerary that starts with a return flight to Europe and subsequently booking a separate ticket to another destination is not impossible; it is just not going to offer value for money. However there are airlines and alliances that offer European and Asian stopovers en route to Australia. KLM does allow you to stop in Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur en route to Australia as it operates &apos;codeshare&apos; flights with Malaysia Airlines (the flight will be operated by Malaysia Airlines, but also have a KLM flight number). For example, Glasgow-Amsterdam-Kuala Lumpur-Sydney-Glasgow costs from \u00a31,424 return until 14 July 2009. And China Airlines&apos; agreement with KLM means you can fly via Bangkok, Hong Kong or Taipei. So Glasgow-Amsterdam-Bangkok-Sydney-Taipei-Glasgow would cost from \u00a3868 return.  If you want complete flexibility, you can book a multi-stop (or round-the-world) ticket. As long as you take one transatlantic and one transpacific flight you can choose from a range of stops.

Our hosts will show us around but what should we absolutely not miss? And are there a couple of overnight trips? This is likely to be the only time we are in the region.Ruth Coppard, Sheffield A Calcutta has its share of great sights - Kalighat Kali Temple, the Indian Museum and Victoria Memorial chief among them. But the real joy of the city comes in walking the streets. BBD Bagh, Park Street, Chowringhee Road and the Mullik Ghat flower market are good focal points, and will give you contrasting images of the city. Perhaps your hosts could get you in to a cricket match at the legendary Eden Gardens.  Popular excursions include a tour to the Sunderbans Tiger Reserve (see sunderbantigercamp.com). The terracotta temples of Bishnupur are a four-hour train ride away. It&apos;s worth taking an early train to see Calcutta&apos;s Howrah Station at its most boisterous. Q My partner and I want to get married in Las Vegas just before Christmas next year, travelling with about 10 friends. As it will be just before the festive season, will flights be cheap? And would we be better getting flights separately from hotel bookings?Nigel Van Beek, by email A The closer you get to Christmas the higher the fares. Fares for next December will go on sale in the new year. The earlier in December you fly, the better the deal. On the 14th you can fly for \u00a3372 with US Airways via Charlotte, North Carolina. A week later the cheapest fare is \u00a3473 with Delta via JFK.  Fares reach silly levels a few days before Christmas which, alongside Thanksgiving, is the busiest period to be travelling around the US. It can work out cheaper to book your flight and hotel together: for just \u00a3414, Opodo (opodo.co.uk) offers the US Airways flight above and five nights at the Circus Circus Hotel (based on two sharing) - meaning you get your hotel for less than \u00a310 a night.

At a time when airlines worldwide are either going bust or cutting flights to stay afloat, Emirates has ordered 58 A380 planes, the world&apos;s largest - and most expensive - new aircraft, to add to its 120-strong fleet.  Executives from rival airlines doubt that Emirates will be able to fill these new aircraft and others it has ordered as the global economic downturn reduces demand for air travel. Others in the industry try to explain away the Dubai airline&apos;s success by claiming that it is bankrolled by the ruling family.  Certainly, the airline&apos;s half-year results last week were mixed. It made a profit of $77m (\u00a351m), down from $643m last year, because of rocketing fuel prices. But, as Clark points out, the load factor - how full its planes were - held steady despite an increase in capacity and a hefty hike in air fares.  Clark, who has worked in the airline industry in the Gulf for more than 30 years, is used to criticism from rivals, which he puts down to envy. &apos;Europeans have been concerned about what we have done - expand and make money,&apos; he says.  &apos;The two cannot be reconciled in the minds of the legacy carriers. Rapid expansion to them means loss. Now they&apos;re saying &quot;How can it be?&quot; It doesn&apos;t fit so [they think] &quot;They must be cheating&quot;.&apos; Set up in 1985 with $10m from Sheikh Mohammed, the current ruler, Emirates is set to become the world&apos;s biggest airline in less than a decade. Its base is Dubai, flying to the Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Its strategy could be described as &apos;New World Order&apos; (rather than the Old World Order strategy of European national carriers like British Airways).  If you want to fly from Bogota in Colombia to Hydrerabad in India, why do you have to go via the US and subject yourself to iris scans and other onerous security checks when you can take the more direct route via Dubai, asks Clark. If you want to fly from New York to Tanzania, why not go via Dubai and save yourself the hassle of negotiating Heathrow?  Clark says that the European carriers have neglected developing parts of the world, particularly smaller cities in Africa and Asia. He says: &apos;Africa is so poorly served. The amount of Western capacity going there is abysmal. Traditionally, you have to go north to go anywhere from Africa. There are many areas where the incumbents have not touched or if they have have done badly.&apos; Moreover, in the New World Order where wealth is increasingly moving east, he questions why Asians should have to fly via the US or Europe to Africa and vice versa when - you&apos;ve guessed it - you&apos;ve got Dubai in the middle.  Emirates wants to turn Dubai into a &apos;truly global hub&apos;, but it does not suit all travellers. Andrew Fitchie, analyst at Collins Stewart, points out that business class passengers flying from Europe to Australia, for example, would prefer to pay more to take the shorter route, via Singapore or Bangkok. Passengers flying from the Americas to South East Asia might also prefer to fly west over the Pacific, not east via the Gulf, he adds. Although for many Dubai is a final destination in its own right, it&apos;s not the only reason people fly with the airline. You could almost think of Emirates as a bigger, long-haul version of Ryanair. It&apos;s hardly no frills - its business class service gets rave reviews - but it&apos;s certainly lower cost than most of its rivals. For example, Emirates is offering flights to Guangzhou in China from London next March for \u00a3575 return compared with Air France&apos;s cheapest return fare of \u00a3693. On other routes the discount is even bigger.  So how does Emirates manage? It depends who you ask. Rivals claim that it is bankrolled by the ruling family and receives subsidised fuel from the oil-rich state. Last week&apos;s profits showed that Emirates has been hit just as hard by the record oil price earlier this year, disproving these claims. But not entirely: while it is not subsidised, Emirates pays much lower landing charges than at most airports in Europe (50 per cent less than those at Heathrow, for example).  Emirates&apos; chairman Sheikh Ahmed also happens to be president of Dubai&apos;s Department of Civil Aviation, which sets landing charges. Asked if his duel role is helpful for Emirates, Clark replies: &apos;Of course it is. We can cross-fertilise between the two organisations.&apos; Emirates also has a young fleet which is more fuel efficient and cheaper to run. It also has lower labour costs than its European rivals. Clark is defensive on this point, not wanting to be labelled a &apos;low-cost operator&apos;, with the negative connotations it implies. &apos;This is one of the weapons in their [European carriers&apos;] arsenal. &quot;[Emirates] have lower costs because we exploit the workers, or the government gives us cheap fuel or we don&apos;t pay landing fees.&quot; That&apos;s complete baloney.&apos;  He points out that Emirates employs chauffeurs to drive its pilots to work, for example. He rejects claims that his airline exploits its staff, but admits that a 42- or 48-hour week is standard, much longer than the average working week for European carriers. There are no unions in Dubai which means fewer labour restrictions. &apos;We look after our staff. But our employees work harder and longer.&apos; Clark is not burying his head in the Gulf sands about the severity of the economic downturn. He admits that traffic from England, traditionally very strong, is &apos;down a tad&apos;, but says passengers from Russia and India are taking their place.  &apos;Who wouldn&apos;t be worried?&apos; he says. &apos;But my other dials on the dashboard are saying other things. People are still paying the fares even though they rose by 50 per cent this year.&apos; The delivery of the A380s has been delayed because of production problems. Clark denies this is a blessing in disguise, given the economic downturn, and claims he could fill plenty more flights if he had the capacity.  A bit like Ryanair&apos;s Michael O&apos;Leary, he argues that the crisis enveloping the airline industry will weed out the weaker competitors, eventually leaving the survivors much stronger. With 60 planeloads of extra capacity to fill in the next five years, his optimism will be sorely tested.", "publicationDate": "2008-11-16T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Business"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/nov/16/emirates-tim-clark-interview", "title": "Emirates keeps flying high", "sentences": ["Andrew Fitchie, analyst at Collins Stewart, points out that business class passengers flying from Europe to Australia, for example, would prefer to pay more to take the shorter route, via Singapore or Bangkok."]}, {"article": "First came the Polish plumbers, overturning the natural order by tackling U-bends in a more reliable and affordable way than their established British rivals. Now there is another field in which east Europeans are driving well-paid Brits out of work - on the frontline in Iraq and Afghanistan. The market in which ex-military can earn six-figure sums as private security guards overseas is drying up, with salaries in sharp decline and contracts increasingly being offered to cheaper foreign soldiers, the Guardian has learned. The National Association of Security Professionals (Nasp), an organisation for those working in the private security industry, said former British soldiers are being laid off by companies in Iraq who are turning to east Europeans instead. The number of Britons providing security in Iraq has fallen from a peak of about 5,000 in 2004-05 to nearer 2,000 this year. Mark Shurben-Browne, a director of Nasp, said the market had reached saturation point, with companies receiving 10-20 CVs a day. But many firms were trying to reduce costs by hiring staff from eastern Europe, particularly Serbs and Croats. &quot;One company sacked half their British workforce and replaced them with cheaper guys with a special forces background from eastern Europe,&quot; said Shurben-Browne.  &quot;The companies are mixing the teams up, keeping two or three expat or British guys on in a team with the rest from eastern Europe.&quot; Shurben-Browne, who served in the 2nd battalion, the Parachute Regiment in the Falklands and as a private security guard in Iraq, said he knew of about 200 ex-British solders waiting six or seven months for a contract to go back to Iraq. Changing conditions on the ground in Iraq have also had an impact on wages. Firstly, heavy insurgent attacks after the 2005 elections meant a lot of firms cut back because they could not send staff outside the safe zones. Now, with a reduction in enemy activity in Iraq and Iraqi security forces taking a more active role, there has been an impact on demand from private security firms. &quot;Jobs are hard to come by now,&quot; Shurben-Browne said.  Andy Bearpark, director general of the British Association of Private Security Companies (BAPSC), said: &quot;There may be some blokes in Iraq earning \u00a3100,000 a year tax-free, but \u00a350,000 tax-free is a much more likely figure now.&quot; Bearpark has heard of Fijians, Gurkhas, Ukrainians and Sierra Leoneans being employed, usually on much lower wages than British and US personnel. &quot;There was a US firm which was not even paying Sierra Leoneans 10% of what they paid their US staff,&quot; he said. While most former British soldiers only did the private security work for a fixed length of time, a few did keep returning to it, he added, usually because they had invested the money they made unwisely. &quot;It&apos;s not unusual for guys to go and buy shares in a Bangkok brothel and within three months they&apos;ve lost it all and then they have to try to get another contract to pay off their debts. They&apos;re not people used to handling a lot of money. The average guy is earning \u00a340,000-\u00a345,000 in Afghanistan, which is nothing like what people were earning in Iraq,&quot; said Bearpark. A former corporal in the Royal Signals regiment who worked for a private security firm in Iraq, said he noticed work was dropping off when he left in January 2006. The 29-year-old, from Bournemouth, identified only as Andrew, has now trained as a building surveyor. He said: &quot;I only wanted to do it for a fixed amount of time. It&apos;s dangerous work. The money&apos;s great but it&apos;s not worth it if you get killed.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-11-17T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Iraq", "Afghanistan", "Military", "World news", "UK news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/17/iraq-afghanistan-jobs", "title": "New taps?

The explosion \u2013 which activist leaders blamed on the government \u2013 was the latest attack on demonstrators occupying the grounds of Government House, but it was the first fatality and marked an escalation in the violence. Leaders of the People Alliance for Democracy (PAD) protest group held emergency meetings to discuss their response to the blast, heralding the prospect of further trouble amid Thailand&apos;s existing political turmoil. Sondhi Limthongkul of the PAD afterwards accused the &quot;murderous government&quot; of having a hand in the incident and called for a mass rally to parliament on Sunday to show the demonstrators&apos; anger. The death of the 48-year-old man brings to five the number killed in political violence as police, backers of the PAD and supporters of the government have clashed in vicious street protests. The bomb, shot from an M-79 grenade launcher positioned on a nearby building, according to the PAD, landed on an awning underneath which activists were lying listening to a band. The blast triggered pandemonium as people rushed to tend to the injured and ferry them to four hospitals in the area. The man who died was reported to have suffered shrapnel wounds to the throat. The violence came just hours after the end of a period of calm that marked six days of mourning for the cremation of the Thai king&apos;s beloved elder sister, Princess Galyani Vadhana. The PAD protestors who have occupied Government House since August are demanding that the prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, steps down, claiming he is merely a proxy for his brother-in-law, the former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra. Thaksin, who was deposed by a coup in 2006, has vowed to attempt a political comeback. But he is in exile in Dubai, a fugitive from Thai justice after being sentenced to two years jail in his absence for alleged abuse of power while in office, and recently had his British visa revoked. A week ago the 59-year-old former Manchester City owner divorced his wife of 32 years, Pojaman, for practical reasons, apparently to protect their vast assets and give him freedom to stage a political revival. He denies any wrongdoing and insists the criminal charges are politically motivated. The PAD, a motley alliance led by monarchist businessmen and retired security forces chiefs, has scored some successes. Its protests claimed the head of one prime minister and two ministers, and came close to fomenting another military coup. But the renewed violence may also lead to more determined efforts to dislodge the demonstrators from Government House, signalling further uncertainty of the kind that has already paralysed the country&apos;s political process.", "publicationDate": "2008-11-20T07:41:47Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/20/thailand-blast", "title": "Fatal grenade attack on Thai anti-government protestors", "sentences": ["One man was killed and 29 wounded today in a grenade attack on anti-government protestors laying siege to the Thai prime minister&apos;s office in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Thousands of anti-government protesters in Bangkok today forced parliament to shut down and a group of riot police to retreat in what activists called their &quot;final showdown&quot; to oust a corrupt administration. Parliament postponed a joint session of both houses after singing and dancing protesters wearing yellow shirts in dedication to Thailand&apos;s monarch surrounded its gates and reportedly cut electricity to the building. Riot police barricaded the parliament with metal barriers and stood guard inside the compound. Nearby, dozens of police in riot gear retreated inside Bangkok&apos;s police headquarters as several hundred protesters pushed past a metal barricade and blocked off the street with razor wire. Rallies were staged at the finance ministry and other key offices. The People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy has occupied the grounds of the prime minister&apos;s office for three months, virtually paralysing the government, which they allege is the puppet of the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Protesters accuse Thaksin, who was ousted by a 2006 military coup, of corruption and abuse of power. Thaksin is in exile, a fugitive from a two-year jail term imposed after he was convicted last month of violating a conflict of interest law. Today&apos;s protest was not the first time the alliance has called for a final showdown with the government, but it was spread across a wider area of the capital than earlier rallies. Protest leaders say their goal is to stop the government from functioning. &quot;One mission has been accomplished. We have won our victory here,&quot; a protest leader, Somsak Kosaisuk, said outside parliament. &quot;We&apos;ll keep doing this until they quit.&quot; He called on protesters to move on to the government&apos;s makeshift office at Bangkok&apos;s old international airport to interrupt a cabinet meeting. The protesters want the current prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, who is Thaksin&apos;s brother-in-law, to resign. Somchai was in Peru for a summit of Pacific Rim leaders and is expected to return midweek. The house speaker, Chai Chidchob, said the parliamentary session would be rescheduled &quot;when the situation returns to normal&quot;. The demonstrators initially called the protest to block parliament from debating a bill to rewrite the constitution, a measure they said would help Thaksin stage a comeback. Riot police armed with shields and batons were under orders to use &quot;as little force as possible&quot; and to try to avoid tear gas, said the Bangkok police chief, Lieutenant General Suchart Maunkaew. He said police were not carrying guns. The last time the group marched on parliament, police efforts to disperse them resulted in running street battles. Two people were killed and hundreds injured in the October 7 violence. The alliance has accused police of being behind an attack last week in which grenades killed two protesters during demonstrations at and near the occupied Government House. Authorities have denied the charge. Alliance supporters are largely middle-class citizens who say Thailand&apos;s electoral system is susceptible to vote-buying and that the rural majority, the Thaksin camp&apos;s power base, is not sophisticated enough to cast ballots responsibly.

Alistair Darling said the move would benefit the environment, but his decision to have a more draconian flight tax and to give only a small boost to a low-carbon economy angered the green movement.  The APD is presently levied at \u00a310 on an economy-class flight to European destinations and \u00a340 for long-haul flights. The chancellor has introduced four new bands with a starting level of \u00a311 on tickets for destinations within 2,000 miles of London; \u00a345 for flights of up to 4,000 miles; \u00a350 for 4,000-6,000 miles and \u00a355 for flights over 6,000. The changes do not come into effect until next November.  The duty will rise again the following year so by 2010-11, the tax on the lowest band will be \u00a312; band B will be \u00a360; a band C flight to Bangkok or Johannesburg will be \u00a375, and the top band will be \u00a385.  &quot;I have decided to reform APD into a four-band system ensuring that those who travel further and have a larger environmental impact meet that cost,&quot; Darling explained. His decision to drop a previously proposed airline duty worried airlines but delighted the Airport Operators Association, which said it had &quot;won the battle&quot;. The World Development Movement argued that the end of a possible airline duty was &quot;bad news for the UK taxpayer, the environment and the world&apos;s poor&quot;. The government did give a significant boost to the wind power industry by extending the Renewables Obligation (RO) of financial support until 2037.  Darling also brought forward what he said was more than \u00a3500m worth of spending to be used on insulating homes and other energy-efficiency initiatives. But there was no wider green New Deal, whereby large amounts of public money would be poured into creating a low-carbon future, as had been called for by environmentalists.  The chancellor said the RO, which legally requires electricity suppliers in Britain to source a growing percentage of their power from green sources, would run for a further 10 years to 2037. This would ensure &quot;investors can plan with confidence for the future&quot;, he said. The British Wind Energy Association said it was &quot;really encouraging&quot; and would stimulate those companies looking at plans to build expensive projects far out in the North Sea. &quot;Under the old regime, many companies were worried that the current RO was going to run out half way through their schemes,&quot; said a spokesman. Darling also said that \u00a3535m of capital spending to promote government environmental objectives would be brought forward to sustain 350,000 jobs in the low-carbon sector. About \u00a3100m of new money would be spent on helping 60,000 low-income homes cut their energy bills through insulation.  Despite these measures, John Sauven, Greenpeace executive director, said he was disappointed. &quot;This was an historic opportunity to invest billions in a low-carbon, high-technology future but the chancellor blew it. We can only hope that by the time he formulates the budget itself, he will have grasped the potential of hi-tech climate solutions to get us out of this recession. &quot;Once again the aviation industry has been given a free pass at a time when its contribution to climate change is rising.&quot;  The government also highlighted expected changes to the North Sea tax regime that are likely to please the oil and gas industry, which feared a windfall tax.", "publicationDate": "2008-11-25T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Economics", "Economic policy", "Airline industry", "Alistair Darling", "Tax and spending", "Politics", "Energy", "Business", "Environment", "Pre-budget report", "Pre-budget report 2008"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/nov/25/pre-budget-report-economics1", "title": "Duty on long-haul flights and funding for wind energy do not satisfy green campaigners", "sentences": ["The duty will rise again the following year so by 2010-11, the tax on the lowest band will be \u00a312; band B will be \u00a360; a band C flight to Bangkok or Johannesburg will be \u00a375, and the top band will be \u00a385."]}, {"article": "     Thai protesters opened fire on government supporters today as the six-month campaign to unseat the elected administration intensified.

The People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (Pad) is a loose coalition of conservative forces that wants to remove the prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, from office and overturn the Thai constitution. Its protests, which regularly mobilise tens of thousands of people, initially set the stage for the military coup that ousted the former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, in 2006. Pad activists maintain that Wongsawat, who was appointed in September, is a Thaksin proxy and accuse his government of corruption and vote-rigging. The alliance has many supporters in the main transport and energy trade unions as well as the business community. Analysts say it represents the old elite, alarmed by the widespread rural support for Thaksin&apos;s populist policies. What does the alliance stand for? Pad argues that western-style elections have only led to corrupt and ineffective governments. It wants an appointed parliament, dominated by bureaucrats and the military. It claims to be a guardian of the revered 80-year-old king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, against a supposed Thaksin campaign to turn Thailand into a republic, a charge denied by Thaksin and the government. Why are the protests turning violent? Alliance supporters, determined to shut down key government buildings, have launched what they describe as a &quot;final battle&quot; to topple Wongsawat. As the demonstrations have intensified, the political stakes have been raised. In October two protesters were killed outside the parliament building in clashes with police. Two more alliance supporters died in grenade attacks earlier this month.  Where is Thaksin? He is in the Middle East. After his party, Thai Rak Thai, was outlawed following the military coup, Thaksin initially went into exile in the UK and bought Manchester City football club. (His stake was later sold to a group led by members of the Abu Dhabi royal family.) Although banned from politics for five years, he returned in March after his political allies in the People&apos;s Power party set up a coalition government. In July, his wife, Pojaman Shinawatra, was sentenced to three years in jail for tax fraud and granted bail. After attending the Olympic opening in Beijing, Thaksin and his family fled back to the UK. Thailand&apos;s supreme court subsequently sentenced him in absentia to two years in prison for corruption. In early November, when he was out of the country, the UK revoked Thaksin and his wife&apos;s visas, preventing them from entering Britain. He has since resurfaced in Dubai, giving interviews criticising the UK for not respecting democracy. What were the charges against Thaksin? In October, he was convicted of violating conflict of interest rules by helping his wife purchase 13 acres of land in central Bangkok from a state agency at a reduced price. His former political allies still face allegations of abuse of power, concealing assets and tax evasion. Although the Thai authorities have frozen more than \u00a31bn of the family&apos;s assets, he is still reportedly worth \u00a3200m. The prime minister has declared a state of emergency. What does that mean? The emergency allows the use of military force in policing activities, and suspends certain civil liberties. Security forces can block roads and deny citizens entry to public areas and detain people without charge for 30 days with court approval. But the army has said its soldiers will not carry firearms or use inappropriate force against the protesters occupying the government compound.", "publicationDate": "2008-11-25T16:55:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/26/thailand1", "title": "Thai protests", "sentences": ["Who are the protesters in Bangkok?", "In October, he was convicted of violating conflict of interest rules by helping his wife purchase 13 acres of land in central Bangkok from a state agency at a reduced price."]}, {"article": "Who are the protesters in Bangkok?

The airports&apos; authority said it had no choice but to close Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport as the yellow-shirted protesters carrying iron bars smashed doors and roamed the concourses. The demonstrators from the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD), which is dedicated to bringing down the prime minister, caused mayhem across Bangkok as they fired on government supporters and left 11 injured, one critically. A PAD spokesman said last night that a bomb had been thrown at a group of its supporters outside the terminal, injuring three people.  Police lieutenant Suthep Wongsaeng said it was unclear what type of explosives were used in the early morning attack at the Don Muang Airport, nor who was responsible. The closure of the international hub, which hosts 14.5 million tourists each year, is one of the most disruptive actions the group has staged in six months of protests that have unseated one prime minister and two ministers. Last night leaders of the anti-democratic PAD vowed to keep the airport closed until the prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, who is due to arrive home from an official trip today, resigns. His spokesman said he would not land at Suvarnabhumi. The airport diverted incoming flights to Phuket, Chiang Mai and Singapore, after the departure area had to be closed because hordes of protesters pushed through lines of riot police, who were under orders not to use violence. Many demonstrators wore masks and goggles and attacked waiting taxi drivers with bats and golf clubs, before moving inside. &quot;There were a lot of people armed with sticks and baseball bats,&quot; said a Belgian tourist, Ben Creemers. &quot;They looked ready for a fight.&quot; The protesters, waving Thai flags and portraits of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, had blocked the motorway to the airport earlier. Many passengers had to drag heavy suitcases miles to the terminal in the hope of catching their flights, while others turned back or waited vainly by taxis. The airport siege capped a dramatic second day of protest - billed as a &quot;final showdown&quot; - that saw violent clashes and several other mass protests designed to disrupt the government. Earlier tens of thousands of PAD supporters picketed Bangkok&apos;s old Don Muang airport, which has become the temporary seat of power since the anti-government demonstrators occupied the prime minister&apos;s office in Bangkok last August. The protesters surrounded the airport&apos;s VIP building prevent a cabinet meeting yesterday, though no ministers appeared after the discussions were postponed. A day earlier there were similar scenes outside parliament, which was besieged by tens of thousands of protesters even as that session was cancelled. There, too, police melted away as the authorities feared a repeat of clashes last month that left two demonstrators dead. But yesterday some of the PAD mob made their way to Bangkok&apos;s army headquarters, where they believed the postponed cabinet meeting would be held. Others, riding in a lorry, were ambushed on a Bangkok highway by government supporters who threw stones and poles. The PAD fought back with stones, bars and catapults. At least two men were seen firing revolvers at their rivals. Hospital officials said 11 pro-government supporters were injured, eight with gunshot wounds. Earlier the PAD had urged government staff to strike to support their demand. The PAD&apos;s desperate tactics are aimed at provoking the army to mount another coup - following that which deposed Thaksin Shinawatra in 2006 - as a way to unseat the government. But the PAD&apos;s extreme actions are alarming its broader base and polls show support for it is dwindling.", "publicationDate": "2008-11-26T01:45:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Travel", "Bangkok holidays", "Protest", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/26/peoples-alliance-for-democracy", "title": "Rioting protesters close Bangkok airport", "sentences": ["The airports&apos; authority said it had no choice but to close Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport as the yellow-shirted protesters carrying iron bars smashed doors and roamed the concourses.", "The demonstrators from the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD), which is dedicated to bringing down the prime minister, caused mayhem across Bangkok as they fired on government supporters and left 11 injured, one critically.", "Earlier tens of thousands of PAD supporters picketed Bangkok&apos;s old Don Muang airport, which has become the temporary seat of power since the anti-government demonstrators occupied the prime minister&apos;s office in Bangkok last August.", "But yesterday some of the PAD mob made their way to Bangkok&apos;s army headquarters, where they believed the postponed cabinet meeting would be held.", "Others, riding in a lorry, were ambushed on a Bangkok highway by government supporters who threw stones and poles."]}, {"article": "     Thousands of overseas passengers were stranded at Thailand&apos;s main international airport today after all flights were halted because of an invasion by anti-government protesters. The takeover of Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights and represented a dramatic escalation of the demonstrators&apos; efforts to oust the government. Protesters from the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD) have been campaigning for six months to remove the government and would like to provoke the army to step in and depose the prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat. The army chief, Anupong Poachinda, has repeatedly said a military takeover will not resolve the fundamental tensions in Thai society. Today, he called a top-level meeting of senior officers, academics and officials. The protest turned violent again early today when a grenade was thrown at PAD protesters manning a checkpoint on the road to the airport. Two more grenades were tossed at PAD sentries on roads to Bangkok&apos;s second airport, injuring three people. At one point about 50 masked protesters demanded access to Suvarnabhumi&apos;s control tower to check the flight schedule in the belief the prime minister, due to return from an Apec summit in Peru, might consider landing there. No air traffic control staff were in the building to give them the information. The PAD vanguard - brandishing iron bars and wearing goggles and hard hats - last night pushed through the lines of riot police who were ordered not to use violence after two protesters were killed by faulty teargas canisters in clashes last month. They stormed into the airport and swirled around the sprawling concourse, first forcing the cancellation of outbound flights and then incoming services. Thai Airways rerouted 16 inbound flights to the old airport at Don Muang, while many other airlines cancelled services. The airport, an important regional hub, handles around 700 flights each day and almost 40 million passengers a year. Serirat Prasutanont, the airport director, said the action left the country&apos;s reputation in tatters. &quot;This incident has damaged Thailand&apos;s reputation and its economy beyond repair,&quot; he said. Some of the stranded passengers were being put on coaches today, destined for hotels in Bangkok or the resort town of Pattaya, with little prospect of the airport reopening quickly. Thousands of demonstrators, mostly sporting yellow shirts or armbands in allegiance to the revered king, settled in on the departure area or milled about the check-in desks as barricades blockaded the roads to and from the airport. Around 3,000 stranded and bemused passengers were given food handouts by the demonstrators, who apologised for the inconvenience and attempted to explain the motivation for the disruption. Many were angry and some scared, fearing a confrontation, particularly after a squad of riot police came to the outside of the terminal building at about 5am. &quot;People have told us to be careful that it could be dangerous,&quot; said Patricia Peel, 56, from Portsmouth, whose partner, John Vineal, uses a wheelchair. &quot;But this is absolutely disgusting. I&apos;ve spoken to many, many English people who said they&apos;d never, ever come to Thailand again.&quot; Passengers were angered by airlines&apos; inability to tell them what was happening or when flights might depart. Some feared going to a hotel in case they missed their plane. &quot;We came here at 5am,&quot; said Jason Melbourne, 40, from Belper, Derbyshire. &quot;But Qatar Airways have told us nothing. I&apos;d happily go and spend a couple of days in Bangkok, but we don&apos;t know what to do.

Earlier he called for fresh elections.  10:46am: A spokeswoman from British Airways has emailed to say &quot;few people would have travelled to Bangkok airport without being aware that the airport was closed to flights.&quot; She added: &quot;As a general rule, about 150 passengers per day are travelling to Bangkok as their final destination from London. Passengers who wish to travel to or from Bangkok are being given the option of re-routing or re-booking their flight to a later date.

It says:   A large number of demonstrators have gathered in the vicinity of Suvarnabhumi International Airport. Access to the airport is limited. Departures have been suspended and some arrivals are diverting to other airports in Thailand. You are advised to check with your airline carrier or tour operator if you are planning to travel via that airport.

That still stands,&quot; a spokesman told Channel 3 television.  11:17am: Protesters will not abide by the army&apos;s plea to leave the airport, an opposition leader told AP.  11:23am: Thai Air has posted this update on cancelled and re-routed flights.  11:26am: The Bangkok Post has condemned the protesters decision to block the airport as &quot;wrong and unnecessary&quot;.  Its editorial on the crisis says:   This move will only further erode the rapidly dwindling public support, a hard-earned provision that the protesters badly need especially at this critical juncture of its campaign. The damage to the PAD [People&apos;s Alliance fro Democracy] however, cannot compare with that caused to the country. Suvarnabhumi airport is the main gateway to the Kingdom.   11:32am: Thai media says the prime minister, who has been away at an Asia-Pacific summit, has arrived back in the country at a military airport in northern Thailand.  11:53am: Thai blogger Bangkok Buddy has spotted a potential Thanks Giving business spin off from the protests. &quot;With all these people not being able to leave by plane, that means the restaurants offering turkey dinners will be PACKED,&quot; he writes.  12:02pm: Most of the 3,000 passengers, who had been stranded at the airport, have now left according to a Thai tourism official. But the yellow-clad protesters have settled in for the long haul, according to AP.  12:14pm:  The protesters have issued an apology to passengers that sounds like a train announcement. It reads:   The people&apos;s alliance apologizes for any inconvenience the closure of the Suvarnabhumi Airport may cause to the public and international visitors to the Kingdom of Thailand. But the PAD believes the measure is crucial to bring an end to the traitorous-killer government.   12:29pm: The prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, has suggested he may consider the army&apos;s proposal to dissolve parliament.  Asked about the proposal, at Chiang Mai military airport, he said: &quot;I don&apos;t know. Let me see details first.&quot;  12:38pm: The Foreign Office says it is helping stranded tourists. &quot;We are monitoring the situation closely. Embassy consular staff are at Suvarnabhumi Airport offering assistance to British nationals affected by the protests,&quot; an official told Reuters.  12:54pm: Thai blogger Surawut describes the scene and the noise at the airport after picking up a friend. The detailed post is summed up like this: &quot;Altogether a very disturbing experience, and it must have been very frightening for people just wanting to get out of Thailand and go home to be trapped like that.&quot;  1:03pm:             AP has talked to more of the stranded passengers. One of them, Eric Jacobson, is worried about Thanks Giving. &quot;Tomorrow is a real big holding in the US and many people will miss it because of some cockamany little protest,&quot; he says.  1:26pm: The prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, is to make a TV address at 2pm GMT, an aide told Reuters.  1:29pm: A protester has been shot dead in Chiang Mai by a pro-government gang, Police announced.  2:17pm: Shots have been fired at the raid of anti-government radio station, according smartbrain on Twitter. No sign yet of the prime minister.  2:27pm: The prime minister&apos;s TV address has been cancelled, according to Reuters.  2:46pm: That TV address by the PM has been rescheduled to take place at 3pm. Apparently he has been meeting the King. Meanwhile, a post on News in Bangkok urges Somchai to stay put. &quot;Let us hope Somchai will remain resolute because dissolving parliament now would lead to chaos and, it seems likely, increased bloodshed on the streets,&quot; it says. It adds: &quot;There is a bit of a lull at the moment \u2013 perhaps people are awaiting news of the meeting? I cannot imagine anything other than a personal meeting being suitable. By the time I post again, I expect the PAD will be responsible for more deaths and misery.  3:06pm: The prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, is not standing down. In his TV address he says his government is legitimate and will continue to work for the country. He condemns the protesters for violating the law and urges them to disperse.  3:21pm: Macsf is providing Twitter updates to translate what Somchai has had to say.

Setanta have recently announced that David Haye could face Wladimir Klitschko next June, with Stamford Bridge a possible venue, while Ricky Hatton fought Juan Lazcano at the City of Manchester Stadium earlier this year and says he may take on Oscar De La Hoya at the Emirates Stadium in the future. But this business partnership between boxing and football is not new. It has been going on for nearly a century. In Britain the tradition of fights taking place at football grounds stretches back to the 1920s and beyond. The first card at Wembley came on August 9 1924 when Phil Scott fought Andre Anderson and there were also bouts at Bloomfield Road (1929), Carrow Road (1930), Selhurst Park (1929), Griffin Park (1929), Cardiff Arms Park (1914 \u2014 when Bombadier Billy Wells fought Frenchman Gaston Pigot), Vetch Field (1933), The Dell (1926) and Sincil Bank (1930). But the furthest we trace the roots back is July 31 1909 when Jimmy Britt lost to Johnny Summers in the ninth round of their 20-round contest at the Memorial Ground in east London. The ground was then the home of Thames Ironworks FC who went on to become West Ham United. In Europe, the Hohe Warte Stadium in Vienna, which opened in 1921, was the Austrian national side&apos;s home for much of the 1920s and 30s. The first and, as far as we can tell, only fights there occured on May 1 1924 with Poldi Steinbach&apos;s victory over Hans Wesselitsch topping the bill. Further afield Rama VI of Thailand (1910-25) gave permission for the first modern Muay Thai (Thai boxing) ring to be built at the Wang Suan Kulap football ground in Bangkok, though when exactly the first fight took place is unclear. More information about the stadium can be found here. Across the Pacific in America boxing was enjoying a similar rise in fortunes. The Polo Grounds in Manhattan was originally built in 1876 for, yes, the regal sport of polo but it quickly became a multi-purpose arena with the New York Giants baseball team moving in in 1883. Football (not the gridiron variety) was first played at the ground in 1894 when half a dozen baseball teams created their own mini-league in an attempt to fill the stands with spectators during the close season. The first boxing match at the stadium came on October 12 1922 and their were regular fights at the venue for the next 38 years \u2014 including the famous heavyweight championship fight between Jack Dempsey and Luis Firpo in 1923 \u2014 with Floyd Patterson&apos;s victory over Ingemar Johansson in June 1960 the final bout at the ground. Yankee Stadium, home ground of the New York Cosmos during the short-lived North American Soccer League, has also hosted 30 championship bouts. The earliest was Benny Leonard&apos;s defense of his lightweight title over Lou Tendler on July 24, 1923. Can you go further back?

And be sure to keep mailing us your queries as we will be giving away a free copy to our question of the week. CAPS BEFORE DEBUTS &quot;Following the example of Michael Mancienne, has anyone ever received an international call-up before making an appearance for their first senior club?&quot; asked Phil Myers last week. It&apos;s much more common than you might think, Phil, if the bulge in the Knowledge inbox is anything to go by. As you might expect, a number of Manchester United players have achieved the feat over the last couple of decades, including Ben Foster, Pat McGibbon, Jonny Evans and Phil Mulryne. Foster, as Jamie Woods points out, had been signed by two senior clubs, Stoke City and Manchester Unitred, but had played for neither when he won his first England cap against Spain at Old Trafford in February 2007. Given the distribution of talent, most examples come from the weaker nations. But, as Taha Saleh observed, Javier Mascherano did make his Argentina debut in 2003 before he had played for his club. Overall it&apos;s possible to put together a half-decent team of players: GK: Ben Foster DF: Ryan Green (made his only two appearances for Wales in 1998 before turning out for Wolves) DF: Jonny Evans DF: Pat McGibbon DF: Ryan McGivern (yet to play for Manchester City but was sent off on his Northern Ireland debut in August) M: Phil Mulryne M: Javier Mascherano M: Steve Morrow (made his Northern Ireland in 1990 but did not appear for Arsenal until 1992) M: Geoffrey Plumpton Wilson (played for England in 1900, making his debut for Southampton in 1901) F: Mark Kelly (played for Republic of Ireland in April 1988, a month before his Portsmouth debut) F: Billy Crone (made his debut for Ireland in February 1882, having only played only a handful of practice matches for his team Distillery. OK he was a defender, but we&apos;re desperate). BIG FOUR NO SCORE &quot;Following this weekend&apos;s results, when was the last time all of &apos;the big four&apos; failed to score on the same weekend/round of fixtures?&quot; asks Dean Gribben, Dave Stewart and a whole host of others This freak occurance is up there with Haley&apos;s Comet, solar eclipses and pies with flavour from football ground refreshment stands \u2014 you hardly ever see them, but when you do the wait makes it all the more satisfying. Nearly 16 years have passed since Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United all failed to score in the same round of fixtures \u2014 before this weekend it had not happened since February 8, 9 and 10 1993, when the scorelines read: Leeds 0-0 Manchester United Chelsea 0-0 Liverpool Arsenal 0-1 Wimbledon Of course, back then the big four were United, Norwich City, Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers, which just goes to show how times can change. Though Arsenal losing at home to mid-table opposition just shows how some things never change. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;Apparently (well, according to Wikipedia), polka dots first became common on clothing in the late 19th century in Britain.

The government and the protesters, led by the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy, are yet to respond to the compromise plan. Somchai is due to have an audience with King Bhumibol Adulyadej later today and it is unlikely his administration is unlikely to take any decision before that meeting. Reuters reported that sources within a pro-government protest group had said if Somchai quit they would regard it as a coup and immediately launch anti-military demonstrations. &quot;There will be war for sure,&quot; one senior member of the Democratic Alliance Against Dictatorship told the news agency. Thousands of overseas passengers, including many Britons, were stranded at Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport today after all flights were halted because of an invasion by the protesters, who have been campaigning for six months to remove the government. The clashes turned violent again early today when a grenade was thrown at PAD protesters manning a checkpoint on the road to the airport. Two other grenades were tossed at protesters guarding roads to Bangkok&apos;s second airport, injuring three people. At one point, about 50 masked demonstrators demanded access to Suvarnabhumi&apos;s control tower to check the flight schedule in the belief that Somchai, who was due to return from an Apec summit in Peru, might consider landing there. No air traffic control staff were in the building to give them the information. The PAD vanguard - brandishing iron bars, and wearing goggles and hard-hats - last night pushed through lines of riot police who were ordered not to use violence after two protesters were killed by faulty teargas canisters in clashes last month. They stormed into the airport and swirled around the sprawling concourse, first forcing the cancellation of outbound flights and then incoming services as well. Thai Airways rerouted 16 inbound flights to the old airport at Don Muang, while many other airlines cancelled services. The airport, an important regional hub, handles around 700 flights each day and almost 40 million passengers a year. Serirat Prasutanont, the airport director, said: &quot;This incident has damaged Thailand&apos;s reputation and its economy beyond repair.&quot; Some of the stranded passengers were being put on coaches today, destined for hotels in Bangkok or the resort town of Pattaya. Thousands of demonstrators, mostly sporting yellow shirts or armbands in allegiance to the revered king, settled in on the departure area or milled about the check-in desks as barricades blockaded the roads to and from the airport. Around 3,000 stranded and bemused passengers were given food handouts by the demonstrators, who apologised for the inconvenience and attempted to explain the motivation for the disruption. Many were angry and some scared, fearing a confrontation, particularly after a phalanx of riot police came to the outside of the terminal building at around 5am. For most, the source of their outrage was their various airlines&apos; inability to tell them what was happening or when their flights might depart, leaving them in limbo and fearful of going to a hotel in case they missed their plane.", "publicationDate": "2008-11-26T11:15:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/26/thailand", "title": "Thai military chief calls for dissolution of parliament and new elections", "sentences": ["Anupong Paochinda also ordered the anti-government demonstrators at Bangkok&apos;s international airport to withdraw after they forced its closure, leaving thousands of tourists stranded.", "Thousands of overseas passengers, including many Britons, were stranded at Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport today after all flights were halted because of an invasion by the protesters, who have been campaigning for six months to remove the government.", "Two other grenades were tossed at protesters guarding roads to Bangkok&apos;s second airport, injuring three people.", "Serirat Prasutanont, the airport director, said: &quot;This incident has damaged Thailand&apos;s reputation and its economy beyond repair.&quot; Some of the stranded passengers were being put on coaches today, destined for hotels in Bangkok or the resort town of Pattaya."]}, {"article": "His Majesty&apos;s loyal opposition: I&apos;d not understood how essential that concept was to parliamentary democracy, or how difficult it is to develop, until I spent 18 months working in Government House in Bangkok. As (officially) a Thai civil servant, I watched three elections and three governments \u2013 those of Chuan Leekpai, Banharn Silpa-Archa, and Chavalit Yongchaiyudh \u2013 come and go (this was in the late 90s, a period of relative stability for Thailand). After each election, there was an unseemly scramble to join the government. There were parties in Thailand who had manifestos, pledges and all the apparent machinery of democracy, but everyone knew that the second the trend of the voting was clear, every newly elected MP would be scrambling to make an alliance with the man who had, with his core supporters, won enough seats to form the next government. The &quot;opposition&quot; rump would consist only of those who through (sometimes) personal scruple, or more usually because of institutional or personal enmity, couldn&apos;t make that link-up through which the spoils of office would be distributed. It was democracy \u2013 free votes, changing prime ministers et al \u2013 in almost perfect framework, and yet almost entirely lacking in any substance. The voters \u2013 at least those voters who had been equipped to make a choice \u2013 might choose a particular direction, but that had nothing to do with how the government acted. I saw the voters of Bangkok trying \u2013 indeed straining every sinew \u2013 in 1995 to re-elect Chuan. His Democrats swept the city&apos;s seats, and they did stand for some basic decencies (if some of their candidate&apos;s halos were more than a little frayed). But although Bangkok is huge, its votes couldn&apos;t outweigh those of the peasant hinterland, where voters will generally act as their village headman tells them \u2013 and that headman acting as his local big man tells him. There was little or no coercion, or even threat of coercion in this, just a lack of understanding that the system should, or could, work any other way. This was what voting meant. Sustaining that belief was the limited and poor level of education. Schools, particularly in rural areas, were poorly equipped, their staff had low quality, if not necessarily quantity, of education, and the claim of near-universal literacy frankly laughable. But it was in the interest of the politicians who ran the system to keep it this way. Educated voters might be less compliant. It was a vicious circle sustaining a political system that has also proved an enormous economic handicap to Thailand. Then Thaksin Shinawatra came along to upset this unpleasant equilibrium. With an enormous family fortune arising from the boom years of the 80s and 90s, he surfed the discontent that followed the Asian economic crisis of 1997. Rural voters grasped his demagogic populism (and he did deliver cheap healthcare and genuine development funding). This was not something that was acceptable to the traditional ruling classes, or the military, which was always there as a check on the &quot;democratic government&quot; (although chiefly concerned with preserving its own prerogatives and perks) or indeed the educated urban middle class, with its contempt for the rural populace. They were not prepared to accept a spell of &quot;loyal opposition&quot;, a period when rural interests would hold sway over theirs. Which is how we arrive at the turbulent scenes at Bangkok airport today. Thailand is now perhaps almost ungovernable (as the military, with its refusal to stage another coup has tacitly acknowledged). Its rural/urban cultural split starting to look frighteningly like that which provoked the Cambodian &quot;Killing Fields&quot;. Yet this is a state that appeared to have everything going for it over the past couple of decades: relative ethnic and cultural unity; massive foreign investment since the Vietnam war and high levels of growth; integration into the international market and attractions that have brought the tourists flooding in; lack of a martial culture despite a powerful military; a relatively benign natural environment. The American National Intelligence Council last week came to the rather late realisation that the triumph of the western democratic model is far from certain; Thailand is there now, as a turbulent case study for that conclusion.", "publicationDate": "2008-11-26T11:31:19Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/26/thailand-bangkok-airport-military-dissolve-parliament", "title": "Natalie Bennett: The scenes at Bangkok airport suggest Thailand may now be ungovernable", "sentences": ["His Majesty&apos;s loyal opposition: I&apos;d not understood how essential that concept was to parliamentary democracy, or how difficult it is to develop, until I spent 18 months working in Government House in Bangkok.", "I saw the voters of Bangkok trying \u2013 indeed straining every sinew \u2013 in 1995 to re-elect Chuan.", "But although Bangkok is huge, its votes couldn&apos;t outweigh those of the peasant hinterland, where voters will generally act as their village headman tells them \u2013 and that headman acting as his local big man tells him.", "Which is how we arrive at the turbulent scenes at Bangkok airport today."]}, {"article": "The Foreign Office said today it was helping British tourists stranded at Bangkok&apos;s international airport after a siege by anti-government protesters. &quot;We are monitoring the situation closely.

It is unclear how many British travellers are caught up in the protests, which have forced international airlines to cancel flights to and from Bangkok. Thailand is the second most popular British long-haul destination after the United States and attracts around 750,000 Brits every year. Thailand&apos;s tourism industry is worth $16bn a year and the airport blockade deals another blow to an economy already suffering from months of political unrest and the global financial crisis. Some tourists who had been waiting more than 24 hours for a flight to London were instead being taken by bus to the city of Pattaya. A Thai tourism official said that by late afternoon local time most of the 4,000 travellers at the airport had left. Britons expressed their fear and frustration after being stranded.

The International Maritime Bureau said that what the Indian navy described as a pirate &quot;mothership&quot; was the Ekawat Nava 5, which had been seized by pirates off Yemen on November 18. Its crew were kidnapped at gunpoint and tied up. India&apos;s navy said last week that the Tabar, on patrol in the Gulf of Aden, had blown up one vessel and chased off two smaller pirate speedboats. It was the first major offensive by a country protecting shipping lanes across 2.6m sq km of ocean. Apparent inconsistencies in the story emerged when Bangkok-based Sirichai Fisheries, which owned the trawler, told maritime officials there had been a mistake. Wicharn Sirichaiekawat, the owner of the ship, said the Ekawat Nava 5 had left Oman for Yemen to deliver fishing equipment and had been taken by Somali pirates. &quot;The sunken ship, which the Indian navy claimed was a mothership of pirates, was not the mothership at all,&quot; he said. The only surviving sailor in the crew of 15, a Cambodian who spent six days adrift, is recovering in a hospital in Yemen. There is no word on any of the other crew. The Indian navy said the ship was a pirate vessel in &quot;description and intent&quot; and had opened fire first. A navy spokesman, Commander Nirad Sinha, said the Tabar had taken action only because pirates on board the ship threatened to attack. &quot;We fired only after we had been threatened and then fired upon,&quot; he said. &quot;This is self-defence. Our ship was attacked by rocket-propelled grenades.&quot; Naval sources said the Indian frigate hit the Ekawat Nava 5 several times and set off explosions. &quot;A fire broke out, probably due to the exploding ammunition,&quot; an officer from the Tabar said. Two speedboats were spotted breaking off to escape. If it was just another fishing ship why would it have men with rockets on board?&quot;  Other sources said the Tabar had successfully escorted around 35 ships. Somalia&apos;s lawless shoreline has made it a haven for pirates, who have been roaming further and further out to sea and attacking bigger ships. There have been 96 pirate attacks this year in Somali waters, resulting in 39 ships being hijacked. More than a dozen ships with almost 300 crew are still in the hands of pirates, who are demanding millions of dollars in ransom. Experts said the Indian navy&apos;s increasingly muscular approach to the problem could not be criticised. A third of India&apos;s 900 cargo ships are considered at risk from piracy. &quot;The route through the Gulf of Aden is a link to the Suez Canal; it is a vital link especially for India&apos;s energy needs. So they are trying to do something to protect their own interests and shipping,&quot; said Nimal Perera of Aitken Spence, a shipping agency in Colombo.

Trying to explain why they grounded flights, the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD) were handing out leaflets apologising for &quot;inconvenience&quot; caused by the unexpected closure of Suvarnabhumi airport. &quot;The alliance believes the measure is crucial to bring an end to the traitorous killer government,&quot; their flyer insisted.  Such hatred in Shangri-la is mystifying. Viewed from outside, the protracted political confrontations - which began two years ago and have escalated sharply in recent weeks - are in danger of destroying the country&apos;s reputation for sybaritic tranquility. In television images, Thailand appears increasingly polarised between yellow-shirted PAD protesters and red-shirted demonstrators who back the embattled government. There have been grenade attacks, shots fired and several activists killed. The bitter dispute tearing apart Thai society is exposing class and regional divisions that have emerged as the country engages with global economic forces. The appearance of Thaksin Shinawatra at the head of his Thai Rak Thai (Thais love Thais) party in the late 1990s crystallised resentment among the rural poor who felt excluded from the state&apos;s tourist and trade boom.  Thaksin scored a resounding victory in 2001, introducing a debt moratorium for farmers, radically cheaper healthcare for all and grants for village projects. His populist policies angered the establishment, including supporters of the royal family, middle-class Bangkok residents, academics, senior military officers and the Democrat party. In September 2006, when Thaksin was attending a UN general assembly meeting in New York, the army moved. Accusing the prime minister of widespread corruption and nepotism, soldiers seized power. Not a shot was fired. The army dubbed it the Silk Revolution. The division between Thaksin&apos;s supporters and opponents \u2013 between the rural and urban poor on one side and the Bangkok elite on the other \u2013 is what still divides the yellow and red factions battling it out on Bangkok&apos;s streets. Elections this year returned supporters of Thaksin to power and infuriated PAD activists, who portray the current prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat - Thaksin&apos;s brother-in-law - as a puppet of the exiled former politician. The PAD channelled its determination to overthrow the government into mass occupations of government buildings and a siege of parliament.  The army \u2013 reluctant to trigger mass bloodshed or mount a second coup \u2013 has so far declined to intervene decisively. Senior commanders are perceived by many to privately sympathise with the protesters. The call by General Anupong Paochinda for fresh elections today only reinforced such suspicions. The pro-monarchist street mobs, aware that they no longer command majority support in Thailand, have advocated a partly appointed parliament as a way around their democratic dilemma. Somchai&apos;s crumbling administration has in the meantime been forced to move out of Bangkok, holding cabinet meetings near an older out-of-town airport. The question facing the businessmen coordinating PAD demonstrations is whether things will get out of hand, inflicting severe damage on the economy and tarnishing Thailand&apos;s international image permanently. &quot;PAD simply cannot mobilise sufficient mass support to maintain a drawn-out campaign,&quot; said Andrew Walker, a Thailand researcher at the Australian National University. &quot;There is every chance that left to their own devices, the PAD will degenerate into a rather eccentric political cult with a bankrupt and self-absorbed leadership.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-11-26T15:29:44Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/26/thailand-crisis-background", "title": "Thailand: crisis exposes class struggle", "sentences": ["Outsiders - and the thousands of tourists stranded in Bangkok&apos;s main airport - are bewildered by the political turmoil convulsing Asia&apos;s most popular beach and jungle destination.", "His populist policies angered the establishment, including supporters of the royal family, middle-class Bangkok residents, academics, senior military officers and the Democrat party.", "The division between Thaksin&apos;s supporters and opponents \u2013 between the rural and urban poor on one side and the Bangkok elite on the other \u2013 is what still divides the yellow and red factions battling it out on Bangkok&apos;s streets.", "Somchai&apos;s crumbling administration has in the meantime been forced to move out of Bangkok, holding cabinet meetings near an older out-of-town airport."]}, {"article": "The embattled Thai prime minister appeared on television today to reaffirm his position as Thailand&apos;s leader and insist he would not step down.

The firm expanded rapidly into neighbouring countries, generating a family fortune that was at one stage estimated to be worth \u00a31.3bn. His business ambitions were soon global. Critics described him as arrogant when he made an unsuccessful bid for Liverpool football club in 2004. Three years later, however, he was able to buy Manchester City for \u00a381.6m and install two of his three children on the board. Refusing to be straitjacketed by existing political parties, he founded his own, Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais). Thaksin denounced his rivals as the complacent products of an establishment that had failed for decades to deliver sustainable development. His populist promises of cheap healthcare, village rejuvenation projects and a debt moratorium for farmers turned him into an overnight hero. In the 1999 general election, Thai Rak Thai swept into office with the first absolute majority in Thai political history. He later explained that his interest in British football clubs was intended to associate Thailand with world-class brands rather than world-class vices such as the sex industry and drugs trade. But Thailand&apos;s better-educated urbanites resented his success and were furious at the news that he had sold his stake in the family conglomerate to Singapore without paying any tax. He was overthrown by military coup on September 19 2006 while he was attending a UN general assembly meeting in New York. For a time he lived in exile in a \u00a34.5m mansion in Weybridge, Surrey, and later in a rented flat in Park Lane, London, owned by his friend and the Fulham FC owner Mohamed Al Fayed. In early November, the UK withdrew the visas of Thaksin and his wife after they were convicted of corruption by Thailand&apos;s supreme court. He is now living in the Middle East. Somchai Wongsawat     Somchai Wongsawat Photograph: Pilar Olivares/Reuters    Brother-in-law to Thaksin, Somchai Wongsawat is a former appeal court judge. He served as permanent secretary in the country&apos;s justice ministry under the Thai Rak Thai administration. He subsequently rose to be deputy prime minister in the cabinet of Samak Sundaravej, another Thaksin ally, who had succeeded the deposed businessman. Samak, by profession a television chef, was removed by the constitutional court in September for hosting cooking shows while in office. Somchai was appointed by parliament to take over the embattled post of prime minister. His relationship to Thaksin has opened him up to charges of nepotism but he insists he made his own way in government before Thai Rak Thai came to power. For the past three months his besieged administration has tried to avoid bloody military confrontations with demonstrators. The government has refused to reveal its location, effectively going into hiding to prevent protesters, who have blockaded parliament, from closing it down.

He has been a significant political presence behind the scenes, persuading rival politicians to negotiate. The yellow shirts worn by PAD protesters are a visible demonstration of their loyalty to the crown. Yellow, in Thailand, is seen as a royal colour. Born in the USA, he was educated in Switzerland. Within Thailand he is revered as a semi-deity. His title, Bhumibol Adulyadej, means Strength of the Land of Incomparable Power. His great-grandfather, King Rama IV, was immortalised for western filmgoers by Yul Brunner as the hero of the musical The King and I.   Protest leaders There are nine prominent personalities at the head of the PAD, which is calling for the overthrow of the government.

General Anupong Paochinda, the influential army chief, urged Somchai Wongsawat to resign and call snap elections to resolve the deadlock, but in a nationally televised address the prime minister said he would continue to work for the &quot;good of the country&quot;. The snub to the army chief heightened fears of an imminent coup as the anti-government demonstrators, whose invasion of Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport provoked the chaos, continued the occupation that halted flights and left thousands of tourists stranded. Last night most of the 3,000 stranded, many of them Britons, were taken by coach to hotels after spending up 20 hours caught in the mayhem. The protesters, who are well organised and funded, gave the tourists food and drink. Leaflets in English explained their campaign and apologised for the inconvenience. But many tourists were angry and some feared a confrontation, particularly after riot police arrived outside the terminal building at around 5am. &quot;People have told us to be careful, that it could be dangerous,&quot; said Patricia Peel, 56, from Portsmouth, whose partner John Vineal is in a wheelchair. &quot;But this is absolutely disgusting. I&apos;ve spoken to many, many English people who said they&apos;d never, ever come to Thailand again.&quot; For most, though, the focus of their outrage was the airlines&apos; inability to tell them what was happening, leaving them fearful of going to a hotel in case they missed their flights.  &quot;We came here at 5am,&quot; said Jason Melbourne, 40, of Belper, Derbyshire. &quot;But Qatar Airways have told us nothing. I&apos;d happily go and spend a couple of days in Bangkok, but we don&apos;t know what to do.&quot;  The Foreign Office said that those planning to travel to Thailand in the next few days should contact their airline or tour operator. &quot;The consular team at our embassy is offering assistance to British nationals affected, and liaising with the airlines,&quot; said the Foreign Office minister Bill Rammell. British Airways said: &quot;Because of the security situation we&apos;re going to have to make constant alterations to our schedules. We understand any frustrations, but I&apos;m sure customers will understand this situation is out of our control.&quot; The airport is a regional hub that handles 700 flights a day. It is vital to Thailand&apos;s tourist sector, which generates \u00a310bn a year - 6% of the economy. Anupong, who has repeatedly shunned calls for an army takeover to restore order, appeared to be trying to find a solution to the crisis by calling a meeting of military chiefs, academics and senior officials. He called on the demonstrators from the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD) to leave the airport. He suggested that the government, which was elected less than a year ago, should dissolve parliament and seek a new mandate in a fresh poll, which the ruling People Power party would almost certainly win. The general also proposed an interim appointed administration before the elections, raising fears among the government and its supporters that the powerful royalist-military elite would use the opportunity to tinker with the constitution to keep them out in a &quot;covert coup&quot;. &quot;There&apos;s no doubt this suggestion was not a very veiled threat by the army,&quot; said Chris Baker, a historian and political analyst. &quot;They&apos;re saying to the prime minister, if you don&apos;t go, there&apos;s the threat of a coup. I think it might happen.&quot; Within hours Somchai, who was forced to land at the northern city of Chiang Mai on returning from a summit in Peru, rebuffed the overture. He said the coalition had a mandate to govern. &quot;My position is not important, but democratic values are,&quot; he said. &quot;I reassure the people that this government, which is legitimate and came from elections, will keep functioning to the end. These protesters ... have destroyed democracy with mob rule.&quot; Even before Somchai, the brother-in-law of the deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, had spoken, the PAD leadership had dismissed demands that its supporters leave the airport peacefully. &quot;We sympathise with the passengers, but this is a necessary move to save the nation,&quot; the PAD leader Sondhi Limthongkul told supporters at the airport. &quot;If he doesn&apos;t resign, I will not leave.&quot; The stalemate between the opposing factions, with the army caught in the middle, threatened to spiral into violence across the country as government supporters shot dead a rival in Chiang Mai.", "publicationDate": "2008-11-27T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Thailand holidays", "Travel", "Protest", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/27/thai-thailand-airport-siege-protest", "title": "Thai PM snubs call to quit to end airport siege", "sentences": ["The Thai prime minister refused to step down yesterday after the country&apos;s army chief called for new elections, and anti-government protesters continued to lay siege to Bangkok airport, leaving thousands of tourists stranded.", "The snub to the army chief heightened fears of an imminent coup as the anti-government demonstrators, whose invasion of Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport provoked the chaos, continued the occupation that halted flights and left thousands of tourists stranded.", "I&apos;d happily go and spend a couple of days in Bangkok, but we don&apos;t know what to do.&quot;  The Foreign Office said that those planning to travel to Thailand in the next few days should contact their airline or tour operator."]}, {"article": "     Bangkok was effectively cut off today as the city&apos;s second airport was taken over by anti-government protesters who were already in control of the main international air hub. Don Muang airport, the former international airport, now mainly handles domestic flights. But it has recently played host to the Thai prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, who used it for temporary offices after demonstrators invaded the compound of his Government House headquarters three months ago. The double airport closure has left thousands of international travellers stranded for a third day. All flights at the international Suvarnabhumi airport have been halted as protesters from the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD) continue their occupation. The blockade of Don Muang was an apparent attempt to stop ministers flying to meet the prime minister, who has summoned his cabinet to the northern city of Chiang Mai to discuss the crisis and a looming military coup. Somchai&apos;s flight home from an overseas trip was diverted to Chiang Mai. A government spokesman said Somchai could declare emergency rule to evict the protesters, but when his predecessor tried the same tactic in September it had no tangible effect as the army said it was not prepared to act. Somchai has dismissed advice by the army chief, Anupong Paochinda, to dissolve parliament and call snap elections. The stand-off leaves Thailand in the grip of debilitating crisis just as its vital tourist industry enters the high season. PAD leaders have ignored the army&apos;s order to leave Suvarnabhumi airport, saying they are staying until Somchai steps down unconditionally. Airport authority officials are considering using the Thai airbase of U Tapao, 90 miles south of Bangkok. It has already received some diverted flights but passengers had to wait for six hours on arrival because of a lack of customs, immigration and baggage handling staff. British embassy diplomats have received anxious calls from people who have been stranded and fear they may run out of money. Thousands are being put up in hotels around Bangkok and the resort town of Pattaya, with their accommodation bill footed for the time being by airlines or the Thai government. One British visitor, Craig Boyle, 24, from north Wales, was offered a hotel but found his own accommodation after his Emirates flight to Manchester through Dubai was cancelled yesterday. &quot;It was suggested to me that an alternative route home was through Kuala Lumpur, but that&apos;s a long way,&quot; he said &quot;So at the moment I&apos;ll stick it out in Bangkok. It&apos;s not restrictive, so I&apos;m considering going north to Chiang Mai for a bit.&quot; There are fears that the situation will turn violent if the army mounts a coup. It held a bloodless coup in 2006 to unseat the former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra. A more immediate concern is potential clashes between government supporters and opponents, with tourists caught in between.

I rather doubt that. For one thing India has been suffering terrorist attacks almost since independence in 1947, some of them far bloodier, though few so theatrical. From Gandhi onwards there have been political assassinations. Where there is poverty, violence is often routine.  In its vastness and diversity, India will absorb the latest blow. The image I will retain from today&apos;s newspapers and TV is that of the well-fed young man in black and blue T-shirt caught on CCTV wielding a machine gun. Ah yes, I thought, that familiar figure: the middle-class radical who takes to violence. I wonder what his problem is. Unfair? Perhaps. But even a cursory glance at the crisis suggests political incoherence to the attacks. Islamic militants? Probably; that has been the recent pattern, coming off the back of what we might call al-Qaida chic, though Indian Muslims \u2013 after Indonesia, India is the world&apos;s No 2 Muslim country \u2013 enjoy full civil rights.&quot;Seeking out British and American passport holders&quot;? That seems to have happened too, which will encourage the usual suspects to say it was all our fault, as usual. But most of the 100-plus people killed in the attacks will almost certainly turn out to be ordinary Indians of all ethnic and religious persuasions who just happened to be in the wrong place. That&apos;s a pretty routine detail of contemporary terrorism too \u2013 from Nairobi to Bali via Omagh \u2013 one that barely provokes comment any more. Two bombs in Baghdad this week killed at least 20 people \u2013 many of them women going to work on a bus, as was the suicide bomber in one of the attacks. Women as targets and as mules, mentally disturbed bombers, the usual stuff of 21st century terrorism, and I expect they got their orders from a chain of command that included people like the well-fed young man caught on CCTV on Mumbai. The craze will pass \u2013 as will the underlying craziness that foments it. But it is always worth asking whether this kind of violence is productive or obstructive of social or political progress. After all, we are talking about India, where Gandhian non-violence eventually broke the British Raj. This very week a major political showdown in nearby Bhuddist Thailand is under way at Bangkok&apos;s airports through largely non-violent means. We do not have to approve of the protesters&apos; goals to applaud the absence of guns. So. Is Barack Obama&apos;s election to the White House (I can still hardly believe it) a tribute to Martin Luther King&apos;s ameliorative strategy of non-violence or was the militancy of the Black Panthers and Nation of Islam a vital part of the recipe for change?  You can pose the question pretty well anywhere where political stalemate offers the temptation to violence. South Africa, where both sides were surprisingly restrained, all things considered; even apartheid&apos;s knuckle-draggers refrained from killing Nelson Mandela. Contrast that with bloody intransigence on both sides of the Israel-Palestine divide. In our own recent Troubles, bad though they were, the Paisleys and McGuinnesses survived to cut a deal in the end \u2013 though I remain convinced that the IRA&apos;s military strategy to drive the Brits out was fundamentally counterproductive \u2013 and wrong. By chance a fascinating example of this eternal debate can be found in Baghdad today, where the Iraqi parliament is voting on the agreement whereby US forces will withdraw to their bases by June 2009, take military action only with the consent of the Maliki government and leave by the end of 2011. Jonathan Steele writes an upbeat account of the state of play in today&apos;s Guardian, proclaiming it a &quot;complete defeat&quot; for the US neocon project \u2013 not the first such imperial setback on the baking plains of Mesopotamia \u2013 and a success for the negotiating tenacity of the Iraqi team. Gosh, that sounds like politics to me, and I&apos;m all in favour of them. Jonathan says the deal &quot;gives Iraq&apos;s national resistance almost everything it fought for&quot; while expressing suitable distain for &quot;al-Qaida&apos;s infiltration and the sectarian conflict which its supporters and recruits successfully provoked in 2006 and 2007&quot;. Well, that&apos;s grand too, a wholesome triumph for Sunni and Shia fusion in defence of national sovereignty. Yet the formula may make light of fairly determined efforts by the once-dominant-but-now-overthrown Sunnis to wage war against their fellow countrymen in defence of their lost privileges, as well as against the invader. Whose bombs blew up those women on the Baghdad bus this week? Good question, Mike. It seems to have been linked to today&apos;s vote \u2013 on the grounds that the Americans are being allowed to stay at all until 2011. It&apos;s that wed-fed lad with the gun again, I expect. But the neocon world view, foolishly naive and unhistoric as it was, was never going to prevail \u2013 even before the fall of Wall Street, a better demolition job than 9/11 incidentally. The Americans said they would leave Iraq. Not all of them may have meant it, but leave they will. Obama wants them out even sooner than 2011, of course, which may or may not happen.

Preamble: Here we are then, the biggest night in Portsmouth&apos;s history, according to Tony Adams. The visit of the seven times European Champions to England&apos;s south coast has triggered the release of no end of patronising guff, with even David James suggesting the Italian aristocrats will be mystified and amazed by the pokiness of Fratton Park, seemingly unaware that every second week Milan play in some ramshackle Serie A stadium that wouldn&apos;t qualify as a bike shed in dear old Blighty.  Still, the views of James should always be respected given he is wearing a shirt once worn (sort of) by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who, of course, was the creator of Sherlock Holmes (who, unless I&apos;ve got my wires crossed, was inspired by another goalkeeping great, Joseph Antoine Bell).  Other facts you may or may not like to know: 1. Milan need just a point tonight to be sure of qualification for the next round. Indeed, they&apos;re probably already there: since the inception of the group stages four years ago, only one team has failed to reach the last 32 with six points. Hands up who knows the identity of that team? Stop giggling, Celtic fans.  2. Portsmouth have won their only European home game to date, beating Vitoria SC 2-0 in the first round of the UEFA Cup. They can therefore boast, of never losing a home European tie, or even conceding a home European goal. A bit like Blyth Spartans.  3. Over the last few months I have been experiencing lucid dreams and it&apos;s a lot of fun. I don&apos;t know how this came about \u2013 drugs, cheese or yoga were not involved, I assure you \u2013 but I am keen to move to the next stage and actually control my somnadventures*. Any tips?  * This word has just been willed into existence; once I gain dominion of my dreamscape, I shall be performing deeds much, much more fiendish.  8pm: Fratton Park is rocking and the (mostly second-string) players aren&apos;t even on the pitch yet ...  8.02pm: The teams are in the tunnel and Ronaldinho, a sub tonight, seems to have made a point of seeking out Distin. The pair have a great ol&apos; laugh, a quick hug and go their separate ways. They know each other, of course, from their days together at Newcastle. Yes, that&apos;s it.  8:07pm: It may be the biggest match in Pompey&apos;s history but that doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;re going to start it on time. Two minutes after the scheduled kick-off, the match has yet to begin. &quot;I experimented with lucid dreaming in high school and did a fair bit of reading on the subject,&quot; cooes Dwayne Mampe. &quot;I did have a fair bit of success with dream control, as I had this recurring nightmare that stopped recurring when I decided that there was a shotgun beside the door. That&apos;s probably all you need to know right there. Anyway Portsmouth should lose quite badly tonight but I hope for my wife&apos;s sake they give a good account of themselves, as she&apos;s a big fan.&quot; Do you actually have a wife, Dwayne, or did you just imagine that bit too?  1 min: No it&apos;s begun. And Channel Five&apos;s commentator, whose name I didn&apos;t catch but whose waffle I did, has just revealed that &quot;Milan will bring a potent mix of catenaccio and salsa tonight.&quot; Not to mention asinine cliches.  2 mins: Crouch and Kanu: is this the tallest strikeforce in the world? And, curiously, also one of the least menacing in the air? Though maybe the presence of Philpe Senderos in the Milan defence will make them more dangerous tonight.  4 mins: A bright start by Pompey, who fizzed the ball around nicely on the rain-slicked surface. No openings so far, though.  5 mins: Rapid, jagged run by Belhadj, showing why I recently recruited him to my fantasy football team. But his cross is not worthy of the top work that preceded it.  7 mins: Pompey continue to look adventurous, until Traore mislays an attempted pass to Belhadj.  9 mins: Hughes is booked for a dreadful late tackle on Flamini, which curtails a promising Milan break. &quot;Ronaldinho and Distin played together at PSG,&quot; lectures Matthew Charlesworth, who apparently believed that I thought Ronaldinho was once at Newcastle.  11 mins: Ooooh! What a miss by Inzaghi! A 30-yard Shevchenko freekick rebounded to the striker, who incredibly had managed to stay onside. But from 12 yards and with James on the ground having dived the other way, the striker scuffed his shot off the post and back into the prostrate keeper&apos;s grateful arms.  13 mins: Most of Pompey&apos;s positive stuff has come via Belhadj and Traore down the left. The pair are taking it turns to overlap and torment the defence. Senderos has just excelled to cut out a vicious Traore cross. &quot;Re: Samba stars - Why are foreign players frequently referred to with reference to some national dancing style, as though all denizens of that country spend their spare time engaging in enthusiastic and passionate gyrations, like uncontrollable children?&quot; howls Ceri Phillips. &quot;Does Fabio Capello send out his &apos;morris dancing maestros&apos; to do battle?&quot;  15 mins: Crouch tries his luck from 35 yards ... and it&apos;s in: because although the ball trickled harmlessly wide, the ref thinks it took a deflection and Pompey are gifted a corner. Which Antonini clears.  16 mins: Little lofts a decent cross towards the back post. Crouch peels off and knocks it back across the face of goal, but Dida pounces to smother the attack.  17 mins: Again Crouch peels off the back of the defence and this time it&apos;s Kanu who picks him out with nice crossfield ball. But the striker&apos;s miscues and Dida is again able to stifle the danger.  19 mins: A loose ball breaks to Shevchenko, who takes it nicely on his chest before attempting a spectacular volley from the edge of the box. His pitiful shot bobbles wide, drawing enthusiastic jeers from the home crowd.  20 mins: Can you believe it took 20 minutes for Inzaghi to be caught offside? Is this a new PB for him?  21 mins: Little and Johnson combine well before the latter tees up Kanu. The Nigerian feints past one at the edge of the box but then sends a weak shot straight into Dida&apos;s arms.  23 mins: Favalli shows the touch of a donkey to trap the ball out of play for a corner. Pompey take it short, and botch it.  24 mins: After patient build-up play by Milan, Kaka clips a ball towards Flamini, who had burst from deep. However, the former Gunenrs couldn&apos;t take it in his stride and it runs out of play.  26 mins: Excellent work down the left again by Belhadj, whose fierce cross spraks panic in the box. Crouch nearly turned the ball into the net, but his header was blocked by Senderos, who was looking the other way at the time.  27 mins: Kaka releases Inzaghi, who had made a lovely run . As James surges off his line to meet him, the striker lifts the ball gently over him ... and on to the crossbar!  28 mins: Emerson chips into the box for Favalli, who has hurtled up all the way from the back. Distin gets to the ball first but his header falls straight to Kaka. Slightly off balance, the Brazilian blasts high and wide from eight yards. But Milan are starting to get on top here ...  30 mins: Touchline report: Tony Adams is constantly conveying instructions with an array of flamboyant hand gestures, making him seem more like a cam orchestra conductor than a gritty English football manager.  31 mins: Flamini clatters into Johnson in a re-ren of Hughes&apos;s foul earlier on. For some reason the Frenchman does not get a booking.  32 mins: The rain continues to hurtle down but not as fast as Johnson just hurtled down the wing. The full-back then cut inside and chipped a ball over to Crouch, who again sent an attempted cross straight into the keeper&apos;s arms.  33 mins: Ferocious tackle by Antonini on Kanu - but it was perfectly fair and that&apos;s exactly what we want to see, isn&apos;t it? The rain lashing down, the match being played at a cracking pace and with much skill, and tackling full of gusto. Great stuff. And all in front of a crowd who are making a brilliant din. Who says the Uefa Cup is pap?  35 mins: Little takes down Antonini with a hard - and unfair - tackle. Carlos Ancelotti springs up from his bench to complain, but the ref waves play on.  37 mins: Venomous low cross by Zambrotta. James claims it at the second attempt and good thing too, because Inzaghi was waiting to strike.  38 mins: Little creates space for himself with a neat trick, and then frees Johnson with a sweet reverse pass. Crouch meets the fullback&apos;s cross, but can only poke it into the side-netting from seven yards.  40 mins: Belhadj and Traore again probe at speed down the left before the Algerian&apos;s cross is headed clear by Favalli. &quot;It will take time for Tony Adams to inflict his personality on this Pompey team,&quot; says Five commentator Stan Collymore, who&apos;s presumably no friend of Adams.  42 mins: Johnson sends in a loopy cross with his left foot and Crouch, having again peeled away from his marker, fires wide with one of those acrobatic overhead kicks that makes him look like a collapsing windmill.  44 mins: Johnson mis-directs a cross from deep but almost embarrasses Dida, dropping down just over the Milan bar.  45 mins: Flamini belts another Belhadj cross clear.  45 + 1mins: Zambrotta wrongly adjudged to have fouled Traore and, to compound that, he cops a booking. The free-kick is in a promising position for Pompey. It&apos;s rolled to Kaboul, whose thunderous shot is bravely blocked by Gattuso.  Half-time: It&apos;s been an entertaining game so far. Pompey have been spirited, speedy and skilful and have at times stretched their august visitors, notably down the left where Traore and Belhadj have been exhilarating. But Milan remain primed to counter and, indeed, should be in front given that Inzaghi had the two best chances of the half.  46 mins: Pompey gets the second half under way. No changes in personnel, nor to the atmosphere or weather. I am about to place a bet on Inzaghi scoring before the game&apos;s out.  47 mins: Kaka almost catches James off-guard with a wicked shot from 25 yards. The keeper recovers to push it around for a corner.  49 mins: Milan have monopolised possession this half without managing to open up Pompey.  51 mins: Diop does well to dispossess Kaka and then twist past the Brazilian and slip a nice ball infield to Hughes. Pompey rolick forward and work the ball out wide to Kanu, whose cross is met powerfully by Little on the far post. His volley smashes into the side-netting.  52 mins: Senderos slips and Hughes nips in to force a decent save from Dida with a long-range rasper.  54 mins: More tidy interplay by Milan but Pompey hold firm and eventually win the ball back, and immediately set Traore racing down the left. Favalli clears at a stretch. &quot;Ah lucid dreams,&quot; blahs Iain Kelly. &quot;I too am struggling to take it to the next level. Apparently meditation and keeping a dream diary is the key but I couldn&apos;t be arsed.&quot; Great, thanks for that, Iain.  56 mins: James crashes into Diop while coming to claim a cross and the Senegalese wardrobe is down and in need of repair. &quot;I&apos;m stuck out in Alberta and just so happen to be partaking in Movember, in a province that has a soft spot for the hairy lip,&quot; bristles Michael Harvey. &quot;Are there any moustaches on the pitch tonight?&quot; No, but there may be a few caterpillars hiding in the grass.  58 mins: A lull. &quot;A Mr. Carlos Castaneda wrote a book called The Art of Dreaming,&quot; states Emma Grimsdottir. &quot;Amongst other tips he suggests you touch the top of your tongue to the roof of your mouth. This should greatly increases the &apos;realness&apos; of the dream. Good luck with your somnadventures, i hope you enjoy yourself.&quot; I see, perhaps that&apos;s where I&apos;ve been going wrong: I usually have my tongue in my cheek.  60 mins: Antonini booked for coming straight through the back of Johnson. This is good because, unable to back Inzaghi as first goalscorer for some reason, I put money on there being a red card tonight.  GOAL! Portsmouth 1-0 Milan (Kaboul 62&apos;)  62 mins: Kanu rolled the ball out to Johnson on the right and the full-back fired in a first-time cross. Kaboul rose and banged a superb header past Dida from seven yards. The crowd go crazy and on the sideline Adams tries to whip them into an even greater frenzy!  64 mins: Pompey are continuing to come forward and as Kanu goes down in the box under a tackle from Zambrotta the crowd roar for a penalty. But the Belgian ref says &apos;non&apos; (or whatever the Flemish equivalent is).  66 mins: Milan change: gattuso off, Seedorf on. Pompey change: Little off, Mvuemba on.  67 mins: Kaka again fails to beat the first defender with a corner.  68 mins: Excellent cross by Belhady from the left. Favalli gets to it before Crouch.  69 mins: With his first touch Seedorf surrenders possession to Kanu, who almost puts Crouch through one-on-one. Bust doesn&apos;t.  70 mins: Pompey continue to pressurise Milan. Kanu held up in the box before dragging it around the defender and teeing up Hughes, whose rash shot flew over. &quot;Since Flemish is merely a dialect of Dutch, the word you are looking for is &quot;Nee,&quot;&quot; reveals Donato Jaggers.  72 mins: Olays (sorry, have to write it phonetically as there are no accents on this computer) from the Fratton Park faithful as Pompey knock the ball around playfully.  GOAL! Portsmouth 2-0 Milan (Kanu 73&apos;)  73 mins: Outstanding work by Johnson, who slalmoed past two defenders down the right and then invited Kanu to prod the ball into the empty net with a pin-point low cross. Pompey richly deserve their lead.  74 mins: Milan susbtitutions: Kaka and Shevchenko off, Pato and Ronaldinho on. &quot;Who are ya?&quot; cry the Pompey hordes.  76 mins: Portsmouth continue to dominate. They&apos;re simply outplaying Milan, who can&apos;t get the ball back at the moment.  78 mins: Senderos snuffs out another Pompey break, getting a foot to Traore&apos;s intended pass to Crouch.  79 mins: Wonderful clip over the top from Seedorf. Inzaghi meets it with a plunging heaader - but for a third time tonight he&apos;s denied by the woodwork!  80 mins:  Traore puts Zambrotta&apos;s cross behind for a corner, which is cleared by Crouch. &quot;Are you Bournemouth in disguise?&quot; chant the locals to Milan.  81 mins: Portsmouth switch: Kanu off, Davis on. &quot;This is unbelievable Paul, absolutely unbelievable,&quot; gushes Greg Webster. &quot;A defense with Senderos in it conceeding ... oh&quot;.  83 mins: More trickery from Belhadj, bringing whoops of delight from the fans. Pompey then work it to the other side, where Johnson yet again finds space. But this time the creator of both goals sends his cross into the crowd. Surprisingly, the return the ball, turning down a choice souvenir.  GOAL! Portsmouth 2-1 Milan (Ronaldinho 84&apos;)  84 mins: Ronaldinho sets Pompey&apos;s nerves a-jangling with an absolutely perfect freekick. From 25 yards he curled it dlicately into the top corner. Nothing James could do about it.  86 mins:  Pato wriggles into the box and tumbles with Diop in close proximity. The ref puts the whistle to his mouth .. but doesn&apos;t blow! &quot;I&apos;m currently in a car driving from Bangkok to Phuket to catch a flight (thanks People Against Democracy),&quot; fumes Anthony Barr. &quot;Pompey&apos;s performance is adding to the surreal nature of the evening.&quot;  87 mins: Milan are exerting huge pressure now. Antonini sends a low-flying rocket inches past the past.  89 mins: Milan are laying siege to the Pompey box now, but the home side are holding form. But it&apos;s tense. So, so tense. &quot;Can you give a shout out for folks near Portsmouth (Virginia) who are following this one and rooting for our namesake?&quot; booms Jami Taylor, possibly while ringing a loud bell. &quot;We are all big Tony Adams and name changing eejit fans!&quot;  90 mins: A groan resounds around the ground as the officials indicate there will be three minutes more to endure ...  90+1 mins: A cathartic roar as James soars to pluck a dangerous cross from the sky. Pompey race down the other ened and Antonini barges into Crouch, conceding a free-kick taht shosuld enable Pompey to wind the clock down.  GOAL! Portsmouth 2-2 Milan (Inzaghi 90+2&apos;)  90+2 mins: Senderos battles to regain the ball in the middle and then Zambrotta sneds a hopeful punt into the box. Inexplicably Inzaghi is able to take it down unmolsted. And from eight yards he slots the ball into the corner of the net, shattering the Pompey dream.  Full-time:  An agonising end to the game for Portsmouth, but their fans recognise a splendid performance and treat the players to a rousing ovation. Two fabulous finishes by Ronaldinho and Inzaghi capped a merciless application of realpolitik by the visitors. Terrific entertainment all round. Except perhaps in this here commentary.

In a televised address, Somchai Wongsawat said the emergency rule applied at the airports occupied by protesters from the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD). He described their blockade as &quot;very harmful to the country&quot;. The PAD occupied the international Suvarnabhumi airport on Tuesday in its efforts to force Somchai out of office. The airport&apos;s continued closure has led to all flights being cancelled and left thousands of international travellers stranded for a third day.  Protestors yesterday took hold of the smaller former international airport at Don Muang, which now mainly handles domestic flights.  But the airport has recently been used as temporary headquarters for Somchai after demonstrators invaded the compound of government house in Bangkok three months ago. The prime minister said navy personnel would help police in clearing Suvarnabhumi airport, and the air force would assist at Don Muang. He did not say when the authorities would act. His predecessor, Samak Sundaravej, tried the same tactic in September. But the move had no tangible effect as the army said it was not prepared to act. The airport closures have effectively cut off Bangkok. The blockade of Don Muang was an apparent attempt to stop ministers flying to meet the Somchai, who has summoned his cabinet to the northern city of Chiang Mai to discuss the crisis and a looming military coup. His flight home from an overseas trip was diverted to Chiang Mai. Somchai has dismissed advice by the army chief, Anupong Paochinda, to dissolve parliament and call elections. The standoff leaves Thailand in the grip of debilitating crisis just as its vital tourist industry enters the high season. PAD leaders have ignored the army&apos;s order to leave Suvarnabhumi, saying they are staying until Somchai steps down unconditionally. Airport authority officials are considering using the Thai airbase of U Tapao, 90 miles south of Bangkok. It has already received some diverted flights but passengers had to wait for six hours on arrival owing to a lack of customs, immigration and baggage handling staff. British embassy diplomats have received anxious calls from people who have been stranded and fear they may run out of money. Thousands are being put up in hotels around Bangkok and the resort town of Pattaya \u2014 with their accommodation, for now, being paid by the airlines or the Thai government. One British visitor, Craig Boyle, 24, from north Wales, was offered a hotel but found his own accommodation after his Emirates flight to Manchester through Dubai was cancelled yesterday. &quot;It was suggested to me that an alternative route home was through Kuala Lumpur, but that&apos;s a long way,&quot; he said &quot;So at the moment I&apos;ll stick it out in Bangkok. It&apos;s not restrictive, so I&apos;m considering going north to Chiang Mai for a bit.&quot; There are fears that the situation will turn violent if the army mounts a coup. It held a bloodless coup in 2006 to unseat the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. A more immediate concern is potential clashes between government supporters and opponents, with tourists caught in the middle. Overnight, four bombs exploded near PAD protesters occupying the government house grounds. Gunshots were heard but no one was hurt.", "publicationDate": "2008-11-27T16:21:18Z", "tags": ["World news", "Thailand", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/27/thailand-airport-protests", "title": "Thailand in state of emergency over protests at airports", "sentences": ["But the airport has recently been used as temporary headquarters for Somchai after demonstrators invaded the compound of government house in Bangkok three months ago.", "The airport closures have effectively cut off Bangkok.", "Airport authority officials are considering using the Thai airbase of U Tapao, 90 miles south of Bangkok.", "Thousands are being put up in hotels around Bangkok and the resort town of Pattaya \u2014 with their accommodation, for now, being paid by the airlines or the Thai government.", "&quot;It was suggested to me that an alternative route home was through Kuala Lumpur, but that&apos;s a long way,&quot; he said &quot;So at the moment I&apos;ll stick it out in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "      Thailand last night declared a state of emergency at Bangkok&apos;s airports, setting the scene for a showdown with anti-government protesters who have occupied both transit hubs, halting all flights and stranding tens of thousands of travellers. The cabinet resolved to use emergency powers and appeared to be preparing to send in police and some military units to clear the airports, the closure of which has been strangling the tourist industry. Earlier the prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, urged the military to remain in barracks as rumours of a coup reached fever pitch in the capital, with many offices, including those of the UN, closing early so staff could go home before dark. Bangkok was effectively cut off yesterday when its second airport, Don Muang, was closed after it was stormed by protesters who were also laying siege to the city&apos;s main international hub. Don Muang handles only a handful of domestic flights, but it has also served as the prime minister&apos;s temporary offices after demonstrators occupied his Government House headquarters compound three months ago. The blockade of Don Muang was an apparent attempt to stop ministers flying to meet Somchai, who summoned the cabinet for crisis talks in the northern city of Chiang Mai. The prime minister&apos;s flight was diverted there as he returned from an official trip. The crisis paralysing Thailand is the culmination of months of turmoil that has pitted the anti-government People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD), backed by the country&apos;s royalist-military elite, against the ruling coalition led by the People Power party, which derives most of its support from the rural poor. The highly organised and well-funded PAD, spearheaded by a business mogul and a former army general, regards the government as a puppet of the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a September 2006 coup, the 18th since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy 76 years ago. The prospect of another putsch capping the instability spawned by almost six months of sometimes violent street protests has raised questions about Thailand&apos;s reputation as a regional beacon of relative harmony and prosperity. With the closure of Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport for a third day, overseas passengers had little choice but to wait in the hotels provided, hoping for a quick end to the deadlock. Somchai vowed that the tense stand-off would be resolved peacefully. &quot;I have no intention of hurting any members of the public,&quot; he said, but added: &quot;I need to do something to restore peace and order.&quot; The state of emergency restricts mass movements, bans gatherings of more than five and allows the government to use the security forces to restore order. Last night ambulances were seen arriving at Survanabhumi and 30 medical teams were on standby, raising speculation of an imminent police assault that could turn bloody, as PAD leaders called on supporters to join the thousands of protesters occupying the airport. Protest leaders said they would not leave until Somchai resigned unconditionally. They shrugged off an order from the army chief, General Anupong Paochinda, to quit the airport. &quot;We will not leave,&quot; said the PAD&apos;s leader, Suriyasai Katasil. &quot;We will use human shields against the police if they try to disperse us.&quot; Somchai also dismissed the army chief&apos;s advice to dissolve parliament and call snap elections as a way out of the impasse. Fearing protracted deadlock, British embassy officials began considering ways to get stranded Britons out of the country, perhaps aboard special charter flights from Thai military bases. Thousands of stranded tourists are being put up in hotels around Bangkok and the resort town of Pattaya, with their accommodation bill footed for the time being by their airlines or the Thai government. One British visitor, Craig Boyle, 24, from Llangollen, north Wales, was offered a hotel after his Emirates flight to Manchester through Dubai was cancelled, but found his own accommodation. &quot;It was suggested to me that an alternative route home was through Kuala Lumpur, but that&apos;s a long way,&quot; he said. &quot;So at the moment I&apos;ll stick it out in Bangkok. It&apos;s not restrictive, so I&apos;m considering going north to Chiang Mai for a bit.&quot; FAQ Turbulent Times Who are PAD? The People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy is mobilising to oust a government it claims is a pawn of Thaksin Shinawatra, the former prime minister removed in a 2006 coup. The confrontation began three months ago when its members occupied the prime minister&apos;s office. Will they be evicted from the airports? The state of emergency would appear to make provisions for a forcible eviction by police and security forces. But the PAD is armed and fired on police lines last month. Do ordinary Thais support the anti-government protesters? PAD says it gets 1m baht (\u00a318,350) a day from the public. But anti-Thaksin interests are suspected of providing most of its funds. The airport siege may be costing it support - millions of Thais rely on tourism for a living. Is there a chance of a military coup? The army says not, but rumours mounted after Thailand&apos;s army chief General Anupong Paochinda suggested that new elections should be called. Thailand has had 18 coups or attempted coups in the past 76 years.", "publicationDate": "2008-11-28T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Protest", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/28/thailand-protests-state-of-emergency", "title": "Besieged prime minister declares state of emergency in showdown with protesters", "sentences": ["      Thailand last night declared a state of emergency at Bangkok&apos;s airports, setting the scene for a showdown with anti-government protesters who have occupied both transit hubs, halting all flights and stranding tens of thousands of travellers.", "Bangkok was effectively cut off yesterday when its second airport, Don Muang, was closed after it was stormed by protesters who were also laying siege to the city&apos;s main international hub.", "With the closure of Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport for a third day, overseas passengers had little choice but to wait in the hotels provided, hoping for a quick end to the deadlock.", "Thousands of stranded tourists are being put up in hotels around Bangkok and the resort town of Pattaya, with their accommodation bill footed for the time being by their airlines or the Thai government.", "&quot;So at the moment I&apos;ll stick it out in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Thai prime minister Somchai Wongsawat has sacked the national police chief after ordering police to handle the protesters besieging Bangkok&apos;s airports. A government statement said that General Patcharawat Wongsuwan has been moved to an inactive post in the prime minister&apos;s office. No reason was given for the move. The news comes as dozens of riot police with truncheons and shield gathered at Suvarnabhumi, Bangkok&apos;s international airport today after talks with protests from the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy failed to end a crippling blockade. Reuters reports that around 100 police set up a perimeter at the airport headquarters building, about 300 metres from where the PAD protesters had besieged the main terminal. Earlier, police said they hoped peaceful talks with protest leaders would end the siege, but warned they would &quot;take other steps&quot; if they failed.  &quot;We are asking them to allow the airport to resume operations,&quot; said Lieutenant-General Suchart Muenkaew, the chief police negotiator. &quot;We will keep talking, but if it fails we will take other steps. The last step will be to disperse them.&quot; Thousands of demonstrators have halted all international flights for a fourth day, leaving tens of thousands of travellers stranded. Expectations that the police and some military units were on the brink of evicting the protesters were heightened last night after Somchai declared emergency rule at Suvarnabhumi international and Bangkok&apos;s second airport, Don Muang. A similar emergency-rule order declared by the previous prime minister Samak Sundaravej in September failed to clear the demonstrators occupying the grounds of Government House, when the military refused to move against the protesters. Last night&apos;s tough talk followed by today&apos;s softer words raised questions about whether Somchai was fully in control of the security forces, a suspicion amplified by his decision to remain the northern city of Chiang Mai among his bedrock supporters. PAD &quot;guards&quot; in hardhats and goggles brandishing iron bars continued to man the five-lane airport approach highway, a barricade of razor wire and a fire truck blocking the road. Following a tense night, many protestors were subdued and lay around on plastic sheeting or mats, dozing and listening to fiery speeches broadcast from the makeshift stage. Long queues of demonstrators in yellow shirts, to show their devotion to the king, formed to pick up free clean clothing, toiletries, basic medicine and hot food from stalls that have sprung up. One woman even offered hair cuts among the silent check-in desks, while the arrival and departure screens still showed the cancelled flights from three days ago.", "publicationDate": "2008-11-28T10:19:35Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Protest", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/28/thai-protest-talks", "title": "Talks fail to quell Thai airport protest", "sentences": ["Thai prime minister Somchai Wongsawat has sacked the national police chief after ordering police to handle the protesters besieging Bangkok&apos;s airports.", "The news comes as dozens of riot police with truncheons and shield gathered at Suvarnabhumi, Bangkok&apos;s international airport today after talks with protests from the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy failed to end a crippling blockade.", "Expectations that the police and some military units were on the brink of evicting the protesters were heightened last night after Somchai declared emergency rule at Suvarnabhumi international and Bangkok&apos;s second airport, Don Muang."]}, {"article": "Jamie Peacock has gone from the bitter disappointment of England&apos;s World Cup campaign to a far more personal crisis as his heavily pregnant wife is stranded in Bangkok by the Thai political crisis with their four-year-old son and her mother.

Describing his conduct as &quot;inappropriate and offensive&quot;, Stuart said his emotions following Australia&apos;s 34-20 upset defeat to New Zealand on Saturday night had not subsided by the next morning. &quot;Still on my mind were the disappointed faces of my players who had worked so hard during the tournament,&quot; said Stuart, who is the subject of a Rugby League International Federation investigation following his outburst. Stuart said losing control was something he now deeply regretted. &quot;It&apos;s a hard thing for me to admit, but I was certainly not in control of my emotions at the time and acted irresponsibly and irrationally. But that&apos;s not an excuse for my behaviour.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2008-11-29T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Rugby league", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/nov/29/rugby-league", "title": "Rugby league: Jamie Peacock's pregnant wife trapped by Bangkok airport demonstrators", "sentences": ["Jamie Peacock has gone from the bitter disappointment of England&apos;s World Cup campaign to a far more personal crisis as his heavily pregnant wife is stranded in Bangkok by the Thai political crisis with their four-year-old son and her mother.", "The trio managed to find accommodation in Bangkok but Peacock is anxious to see his family and the other British citizens trapped in Thailand back home as soon as possible.", "What if my wife has to give birth in Bangkok?&quot; Australia&apos;s coach, Ricky Stuart, has apologised for his &quot;offensive&quot; behaviour towards World Cup officials."]}, {"article": "Sept 2006  Military coup ousts prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra May 2007 Thaksin&apos;s party is banned Aug 2007 Voters approve new constitution Dec 2007 Elections won by People Power Party (PPP), a pro-Thaksin bloc Feb 2008 Veteran politician and occasional TV chef Samak Sundaravej becomes prime minister July 2008 Thaksin corruption trial begins Aug 2008 Thaksin flees to Britain Sept 2008 State of emergency in Bangkok following week of protests calling for Samak to step down.

Somchai Wongsawat&apos;s decision to remove police general Pacharawat Wongsuwan was another sign of the deepening tensions between the government and the security forces that have raised fears of another coup.  But as the airport demonstrators were given an ultimatum to leave, riot police were seen gathering at Suvarnabhumi international, suggesting that they were preparing to clear the terminal, which had been shut down for a fourth day. In a move to rescue thousands of travellers stranded by the closures, passengers were being bussed from the nearby resort town of Pattaya to the Vietnam war-era naval airbase of U-Tapao, south of Bangkok, where 60 flights departed yesterday. Several Asian airlines were planning further flights today to rescue staff and passengers.  The Thai tourist authority hoped the aircraft might also bring in new arrivals for the start of the tourist high season, though the capacity of U-Tapao will be a fraction of that of the main airports. The removal of the police chief &quot;as a result of his performance during this crisis&quot; suggested that the four-day standoff between the government and protesters from the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD) might be moving towards a conclusion. As darkness fell last night PAD &quot;guards&quot; clad in hardhats and goggles brandishing iron bars, continued to man a razor-wire barricade checkpoint on the five-lane airport approach road. Just a few hundred metres away 200 police with batons and shields gathered and scores of ambulances were lined up, suggesting the security forces were preparing an assault that might turn bloody. The recently appointed police chief, an opponent of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra who was deposed in a coup in 2006, had joined Thailand&apos;s armed services chiefs last month on television, suggesting Somchai should step down. Despite the tough stand, the prime minister tried in another national address yesterday to reassure the public that a softly-softly approach would be used to clear the airports. &quot;Don&apos;t worry,&quot; he said. &quot;Officials will use gentle measures to deal with them.&quot; Earlier in the day police began negotiations by phone with the protesters&apos; leaders, who are demanding that Somchai&apos;s government step down unconditionally. Officers hinted of sterner measures if the demonstrators did not leave quietly. &quot;We are asking them to allow the airport to resume operations,&quot; said Lieutenant General Suchart Muenkaew, the chief negotiator. &quot;We will keep talking, but if it fails we will take other steps. The last step will be to disperse them.&quot; Somchai had declared a state of emergency on Thursday evening at Suvarnabhumi and Bangkok&apos;s second airport, Don Muang, leading to expectations that police and some military units were on the brink of evicting the protesters by force.

A similar emergency rule order declared by the previous prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, in September to clear the demonstrators occupying the grounds of Government House also fell flat when the military refused to intervene. The inaction after the latest emergency rule declaration raised questions about whether Somchai was in total control, a suspicion amplified by his decision to remain in the northern city of Chiang Mai among his bedrock supporters because of tensions with the military. The sacking of the police chief was clearly an attempt to wrest back the initiative. It prompted renewed speculation that the prime minister would also remove army chief Anupong Paochinda because of his criticism of Somchai, a scenario categorically denied earlier. But the new tougher stance drew a stern response from PAD, whose members said they were prepared to &quot;fight to the death&quot; if they did not get their way. &quot;We are ready to defend ourselves against any government&apos;s operations to get us out of those places,&quot; a spokesman said.", "publicationDate": "2008-11-29T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Protest", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/29/thailand-coup", "title": "Coup fears rise after Thai prime minister sacks police chief", "sentences": ["The Thai prime minister sacked the country&apos;s police chief last night after security forces failed to evict anti-government demonstrators from Bangkok&apos;s two airports, leaving the country all but cut off and thousands of overseas travellers stranded.", "In a move to rescue thousands of travellers stranded by the closures, passengers were being bussed from the nearby resort town of Pattaya to the Vietnam war-era naval airbase of U-Tapao, south of Bangkok, where 60 flights departed yesterday.", "The last step will be to disperse them.&quot; Somchai had declared a state of emergency on Thursday evening at Suvarnabhumi and Bangkok&apos;s second airport, Don Muang, leading to expectations that police and some military units were on the brink of evicting the protesters by force."]}, {"article": "If you&apos;ve never given anyone a talking book before, now&apos;s the time and here&apos;s the book. Christmas Crackers (Hodder, \u00a314.99) has absolutely nothing to do with skating vicars, flying snowmen, figgy pudding or any of the usual seasonal trimmings that every literary compilation published right now feels obliged to include. Thirty years ago, instead of a Christmas card, John Julius Norwich started sending his friends a personal collection of quirky snippets, poems, quotes and pastiches culled from newspapers and anthologies. The original homely pamphlets progressed to slim volumes and now, at last, to audio, read and occasionally sung by the compiler with exquisite timing and panache. The opening salvo, from an article in the Bangkok Post about a Bach piano recital that began with the second-octave D becoming stuck \u2014&quot;some who attended the performance later questioned whether the awkward key justified some of the language coming from the stage during softer passages of the fugue&quot; \u2014 and ended with the pianist attempting to destroy the piano with an axe, made me (and this is rare) laugh out loud. It gets better. There&apos;s a German translation of &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;, selected items from Princess Anne and Mark Phillips&apos;s wedding presents (a book called Understanding Cystitis, novelty handcuffs) and a piece by Winston Churchill on painting that includes a poem he liked to quote in an accent worse than Edward Heath&apos;s: &quot;La peinture a l&apos;huile / Est bien difficile / Mais c&apos;est beaucoup plus beau / Que la peinture a l&apos;eau.&quot; And then there&apos;s the extraordinary fate of Louis XIV&apos;s preserved heart, which was eaten, by mistake, by an Oxford don (he died the same night), and a letter to the Times dated June 25 1992, which starts: &quot;Sir, Last Sunday I dragged myself away from watching the end of the Test match at Lord&apos;s in order to preach at our evening service on the theme of &apos;what Christians believe about the Trinity&apos;. The last three balls I watched being bowled were by Ian Salisbury, England&apos;s exciting new spin bowler. The first was a leg spinner, the second a top spinner, the third a googly. I&apos;d been ferreting around for a helpful illustration of the Trinity ...&quot; I defy anyone not to cherish this dry, witty, erudite, quintessentially English (like its author) collection, whose profits go to the Venice in Peril Fund. In one bound, solve the perennial present problem, make someone laugh and save Venice. It has to make sense. And so does giving someone with specialist interests \u2014 wine, say, or cats or history \u2014 a book tailored to their preference. A Guide to Wine, written and read by Julian Curry (Naxos, \u00a316.99), is a chatty, moderately technical handbook with just the right balance of history, geography, anecdote and advice about every aspect of this vast subject, from how far apart to plant your vines to the ideal corkscrew. Champagne corks shouldn&apos;t pop, by the way, they should give a gentle sigh, he says, like a satisfied woman. Anyone with a cat will want to dip into How to Own a Human (crimsoncats.co.uk, \u00a39.99), an entertaining little anthology, with appropriate clarinet accompaniment from Peter and the Wolf, about various famous felines. There&apos;s Selima, Horace Walpole&apos;s unfortunate tortoiseshell immortalised in Thomas Gray&apos;s poem, and Sizi, Albert Schweitzer&apos;s moggy and companion at his clinic in Africa, to whom he was so enslaved that if she was asleep on his left arm (he was left-handed), he would continue writing prescriptions with his right. Lytton Strachey, Saki and Edward Lear wrote about cats, but no one defines the idiosyncratic feline mix of arrogance, inscrutability and independence better than Kipling in his Just So story &quot;The Cat that Walked by Himself&quot;, which is here in its glorious entirety. My two favourite histories this year were Tom Holland&apos;s searchlight beam into the dark ages, Millennium, and Juliet Barker&apos;s debunking of a national icon, Agincourt (both Hachette, \u00a316.99). Still in icon territory there&apos;s a crop of repackaged Letters from America to mark Alistair Cooke&apos;s centenary year (BBC, from \u00a38.99), the most relevant being his election reports, from Truman in 1948 to Bush in 2000. And there&apos;s a new Spoken Word edition of homegrown novelists (British Library, \u00a319.95), which includes Baroness Orczy explaining how the Scarlet Pimpernel first came to her out of the fog at Temple station and Nancy Mitford recalling the letter she received after she had written an article about English trains being dirty: &quot;Dear Miss Mitford, If you don&apos;t like what you find in this country please go back to the Paris brothels where you belong.

The government&apos;s decision to increase Air Passenger Duty has had the airlines up in arms and smaller operators are bracing themselves for hard times as short-break &apos;treat&apos; trips supposedly go out of the window and we all focus on our one week in the sun. But is it really all bad news?  Why are prices set to rise? For European holidays, the biggest reason is the exchange rate. At this time of year hoteliers are block-booking their rooms and striking deals for next summer. Sterling hit its lowest point against the euro in five years earlier this month (\u20ac1.2), which means that even if European hotels have kept their rates the same, the price in sterling will have increased.  Even if the exchange rate improves, tour operators won&apos;t change their prices; Thomas Cook&apos;s packages are up by around 8 per cent and Thomson by around 4 per cent, although they are increasing their all-inclusive programme as a &apos;value for money&apos; option. Have prices gone up across the board? One of the areas where there are real bargains available is cruising - traditionally one of the more expensive corners of the market. Oceania (01344 772344; www.oceaniacruises.co.uk) has savings of up to 50 per cent on its winter cruise programme, until April 2009: a 12-night cruise in Australia now costs \u00a31,499, down from \u00a32,542 and Silversea (0844 770 9030; www.silversea.com) is offering discounts of up to 30 per cent. Are long-haul trips getting cheaper? Financially, if not environmentally, long-haul is increasingly good value - with budget airlines such as Ryanair looking at routes to the US, and AirAsia (www.airasia.com) beginning flights this week from Stansted to Kuala Lumpur from \u00a399 one way. &apos;Long-haul currencies are generally unaffected by the weak pound,&apos; says Jonny Cudworth of Expedia. &apos;If you want luxury on a budget, you can get a five-star hotel in Bangkok for the price of a two-star in New York or London. There&apos;s more growth in long-haul because once you&apos;re there it&apos;s so much more affordable. A two-week holiday in the US is going to cost far less in terms of spending money than a trip to Europe.&apos; So will there be good late deals next summer? It&apos;s unlikely, mostly because there is a lot less availability. Major tour operator Tui has cut its summer programme by more than a quarter, and smaller companies, some of which are actually increasing their programmes for 2009, tend to discount relatively little. &apos;We have a high rate of repeat clients - almost 50 per cent - who are often early bookers, and we don&apos;t want to penalise those people by discounting later in the season,&apos; says Christopher Ellison of Vintage Travel.  If you want a specific holiday at a specific time in a specific place, you&apos;re better off taking advantage of early booking discounts; Thomson (www.thomson.co.uk) is offering good online deals for next summer (holidays start at around \u00a3180 for a week in May) with just \u00a350 deposit payable now. Will it be cheaper to book hotel rooms directly? The short answer is yes. &apos;Generally hotel rooms are cheaper now than this time last year,&apos; says Alison Couper of Hotelzone. &apos;I think 2009 is going to be a good year for consumers - if hoteliers have rooms to fill because they don&apos;t have deals with tour operators, they may have to reduce their rates.&apos;  Cudworth at Expedia agrees: &apos;Rates are down in North America by 15 per cent, and in Europe by 10-15 per cent.

This new feature will also create more opportunities for broadcasters and the media to generate exciting coverage.&quot; The leading Super League coaches are unlikely to share that enthusiasm, as the power to select their opposition, while giving them the chance to take into account other teams&apos; form and fitness, will also provide that opposition with unprecedented motivation. However, this is an undeniably imaginative attempt to devise atop-eight play-off series that provides suitable advantages to the teams who have been the most consistent during the season \u2014 a problem that has been causing controversy in Australia for several years, with both the National Rugby League and Australian Rules football struggling and so far failing to come up with a satisfactory system. The RFL had to do something different as the play-offs will be expanded from six teams to eight next season when the Super League grows from 12 to 14 clubs.  Finishing in the top four will guarantee a second chance, with first playing fourth and second playing third in the first round, while fifth plays eighth and sixth plays seventh in elimination matches. Then in the second round the two losers from the top four will have home advantage against the winners from the elimination matches in two more sudden-death fixtures, and it is after those games are played that the highest-placed winner from round one will choose which of the two qualifiers they will face in the semi finals. The two semi-final winners will then contest the grand final at Old Trafford in on October.

There is a danger the decision to ban the prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, from politics for five years will end up pleasing no one and add to the tensions in an already fractious country. The finding of electoral fraud by constitutional court has angered the red-shirted, pro-government United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), which has described it as a &quot;judicial coup&quot;, and there is anxiety about the how the government&apos;s rural support will react. But analysts say the ruling may also fail to placate the yellow-shirted, anti-government People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (Pad), despite the celebrations at the airports today. The governing coalition&apos;s plan to reform as a new party, called Peua Thai, will likely lead to further angry protests. However, it is unclear whether Peua Thai would be legally allowed to form a new government, and any such attempts are likely to be fiercely resisted. Protesters said this morning they would not abandon the current airport protests, but Pad has since said it will call a halt to them at midnight (5pm BST). Pad sees Somchai and his colleagues in the People Power party (PPP) as puppets of the former prime minister Thaskin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a coup in 2006, and there are fears of further clashes between the UDD and Pad. An anti-government protester was killed when a grenade was thrown from a flyover near the Don Muang airport. Today&apos;s Bangkok Post even raised the prospect of a civil war and warned that &quot;violence cannot be avoided&quot;. It urged the authorities to restore order. Talk of a civil war may be too pessimistic, but the country is certainly divided. The business elite and the military backs Pad, but the government enjoys widespread support among the poor, particularly in the countryside. Some are hoping the 80-year-old king, who is respected by both sides, will step in to resolve the crisis and recommend a government of national unity. He is thought to favour the protesters after he criticised the government&apos;s economic policy. He is also suspected of ordering the coup against Thaksin. In the past he has only made calls for national unity after violence has broken out. The prolific Thai blogger Bangkok Pundit puts the chances of royal intervention at only 5%. Despite its name, Pad is an anti-democratic movement that favours an appointed government. It claims democracy is unsuitable for Thailand because it leads to corruption of the kind highlighted in the case ruled on today. It has the support of the military. But the military has held back from intervening this time after a coup two years ago succeeded in removing Thaksin, but not his acolytes. Khi Kwai, another prominent Thai political blogger, argues today&apos;s &quot;judicial coup&quot; could represent the best hope for resolving the political crisis peacefully. Writing before the widely expected ruling, he predicted a court decision to dissolve the ruling PPP would give the party&apos;s leadership the chance to regroup and step down without giving in to Pad&apos;s demands. He said they could then potentially reclaim power with an even stronger popular mandate. But will Pad allow this to happen?

The couple said they were shocked at the lack of support and advice from the Foreign Office. They managed to get a flight back through luck, persistence and the help of their airline, Thai Airways. They arrived home in Colindale, north-west London, yesterday afternoon after a 36-hour journey. &quot;Honest to God, we&apos;re lucky to be home,&quot; said Malde. &quot;It wasn&apos;t frightening exactly, but it was a very anxious time to be stuck somewhere when there&apos;s a civil war going on. &quot;When you&apos;re abroad you think you&apos;ll always have the assistance and support of your government, so getting nothing from them was really disappointing. We had to do everything ourselves. &quot;I feel ashamed to say that it was such a poor service [from the Foreign Office], especially when we saw Australian and New Zealand officials taking people&apos;s details and giving out factsheets. There was no one from the British embassy.&quot; Malde, a pharmacist who turns 28 tomorrow, and Chandarana, a 30-year-old actuary, were looking forward to their honeymoon after it was postponed for more than a year due to family bereavement. They spent two idyllic weeks in Phuket and were due to fly out of Bangkok last Thursday. The flight was cancelled and the airport was blocked. They called the British embassy but were told by an official there was nothing he could do to help them and they should contact their airline instead. &quot;At that point we realised we were on our own,&quot; said Malde. After spending hours each day calling Thai Airways, the couple were offered a flight to Frankfurt, leaving on Sunday night from a military airport near Bangkok. The airport was too small to process passengers, who were checked in at a nearby hotel. &quot;People were pushing and shoving, it was hot and there was no water. We had moved three metres in three hours when there was this surge of people and we somehow squeezed through to the front. We must have been one of the last, if not the last, people to get on the flight,&quot; said Malde. After being driven to airport in a convoy of coaches protected by a police escort, the couple arrived to find more scenes of chaos, with several thousand people outside and several thousand more packed inside. &quot;We&apos;d seen some pictures on the news but the reality is ten times worse, it&apos;s complete chaos,&quot; said Malde. She saw no representatives from the British embassy either at the check-in hotel or the airport. &quot;If I could say something to the Foreign Office, it would be to show some sort of presence \u2013 to reassure people and to give what information you have. The worst thing is the uncertainty.&quot; The couple estimate that they have spent around \u00a31,500 on hotel and other expenses and flights from Frankfurt to London. They have been told by their insurer that they cannot reclaim the money because their policy excludes terrorism-related delays.

Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi International airport has now reopened. The thousands of yellow-clad demonstrators, who dramatically occupied and closed down all flights at the airport a week ago demanding the PM&apos;s resignation, won their demand to unseat the alleged &quot;puppet government&quot;.  The highest court in Thailand \u2013 the constitutional court \u2013 dissolved the three major ruling parties including the party of prime minister Somchai Wongsawat, Thaksin&apos;s brother-in-law, for vote-buying and corruption committed during the last election campaign in December 2007. The controversial court ruling was delivered at a time when PM Somchai&apos;s government had ceased to govern, amid escalating violence and mounting rumours of a military coup in this highly coup-prone nation. The last military coup was just two years ago when the military seized power, urged on by monarchists, leading to the ousting of billionaire prime minister Thaksin in 2006, accused of serial corruption, and offending the monarchy. Although PAD stands for People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy, PAD leaders would have welcomed a military coup once again, despite that fact the country has already endured 17 coups since the second world war. Thaksin, whose UK visa was revoked after he was found guilty in absentia by a Thai court and sentenced to two years&apos; imprisonment for corruption, is currently in Hong Kong. He mostly resides in Dubai and is reported to still be plotting a comeback. While the PAD has finally agreed to hand the international airport back to the Thai authorities, Thailand&apos;s bitter political polarisation and hatred between pro-and anti-Thaksin camps remains unresolved. The court&apos;s decision to effectively overturn the mandate of the people in the December 2007 election is only likely to inflame the pro-Thaksin camp. Mobilising against the yellow-shirts of the PAD are the red-shirted supporters of Thaksin, under the banner of the Democratic Alliance Against Dictatorship (DADD). Most of their support comes from outside Bangkok especially in the rural areas. Thaksin supporters have already vowed to fight a judicial ruling that they consider to be &quot;a back-door coup and conspiracy&quot; to undermine the results of the last election.  The wearing of yellow by the PAD signifies a deep reverence and allegiance to the king. The gap between these monarchists, the middle-class elite and the bright lights of Bangkok \u2013 the bastion of the &quot;yellow army&quot; \u2013 and the great marjority of citizens living in rural areas with insufficient schools and lack of affordable healthcare \u2013 the constituency of the &quot;reds&quot; \u2013 has become a mighty chasm of mutual class hatred which many fear could soon descend into mass bloodshed and civil war. Pad extremists dressed in yellow have killed the pro-Thaksin red-shirts and both sides have settled arguments with bullets in recent days. A series of grenades targeting PAD people have exploded, injuring scores of people and bringing Bangkok closer to gang warfare with both sides backed and funded by factions of the wealthy elite and ruling class. So, what next for Thailand? Groups of academics have appealed for reason and reconciliation to replace the hatred and bigotry dividing the nation into yellow and red camps and to create a new unifying force. But it will not be easy. Not only the economy, but all the institutions that should support democracy have taken a savage battering. First the Thai courts disbanded Thaksin&apos;s original populist party, Thai Rak Thai (Thai Love Thai ). Now the party&apos;s clone \u2013 the People&apos;s Power party \u2013 has met the same fate. The courts have lost credibility and are no longer accepted as neutral by millions of Thaksin supporters. Rather, they are seen as an instrument of anti-Thaksin forces and under the influence of some of the king&apos;s privy councillors. The political parties were seen to be corrupt, incompetent and unable to provide any way out of the crisis. It seems that only in Thailand can some 5,000 demonstrators overwhelm security forces at a major international airport in spite of all modern-day terrorist alerts, and so easily chase away attempts by the police to enforce a public emergency and evict the demonstrators. Senior police officers are fully aware that rich and powerful patrons have funded and sustained the airport seizure.  The army, while refusing to stage a coup, showed no interest in a more limited role of safeguarding the airport. The middle class in the developing world has long been identified as a major catalyst for democratisation against dictatorship. In 1992, against the rule of Thai generals, the rising middle class backed the pro-democracy demonstrations.  But electoral success in the vote-rich rural areas of Thaksin and Thaksin&apos;s allies, has convinced many sections of the middle class and the ruling elite to endorse a regression back to a more limited democracy, with only 50% of the country&apos;s lawmakers being elected. The PAD is clear in its intent to dilute the voice of the majority. Some power would be given to the monarch or the privy council, in order to balance the power of corrupt politicians. They have become contemptuous of the &quot;ignorant, easily-corrupted masses&quot;.  This attempt to thrust Thai democracy into reverse gear has already pushed Thailand to the brink. The only way to avert more bloodshed is for PAD to abandon its arrogant elitism and alliances with the military. The best antidote to Thaksin&apos;s people would be the building of bridges across the urban-rural divide and a much-needed dialogue and reconciliation with the countryside.", "publicationDate": "2008-12-02T17:37:54Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/dec/02/thailand", "title": "Tom Fawthrop: What next for Thailand?", "sentences": ["The Thai crisis that has paralysed Bangkok&apos;s airports, devastated the economy and polarised the nation between the monarchists and the pro-Thaksin Shinawatra camp is far from over, despite a court ruling disbanding three of the parties in the government coalition and forcing the prime minister&apos;s resignation.", "Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi International airport has now reopened.", "Most of their support comes from outside Bangkok especially in the rural areas.", "The gap between these monarchists, the middle-class elite and the bright lights of Bangkok \u2013 the bastion of the &quot;yellow army&quot; \u2013 and the great marjority of citizens living in rural areas with insufficient schools and lack of affordable healthcare \u2013 the constituency of the &quot;reds&quot; \u2013 has become a mighty chasm of mutual class hatred which many fear could soon descend into mass bloodshed and civil war.", "A series of grenades targeting PAD people have exploded, injuring scores of people and bringing Bangkok closer to gang warfare with both sides backed and funded by factions of the wealthy elite and ruling class."]}, {"article": "Ending the blockade will relieve more than 300,000 stranded tourists.

The People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy, which had demanded that the prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, quit and the government step down, claimed victory and said it would today end its week-long sit-in, which has left 300,000 foreign travellers stranded. But uncertainty surrounded the resumption of flights at Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi international airport. The airport director said he could not decide the restart date until sensitive systems had been examined. The sudden end to the dramatic standoff that has paralysed the country&apos;s lucrative tourist industry caught observers by surprise. The court&apos;s decision is unlikely to dramatically alter Thailand&apos;s political landscape, which is riven with divisions. The ruling also raised the spectre of street violence after government supporters angered by the judges&apos; decision surrounded the Bangkok court and refused to allow the judiciary to leave. Hours earlier a grenade was thrown at Bangkok&apos;s barricaded domestic terminal, Don Muang, killing one demonstrator and injuring 22. Judges from the constitutional court found the People Power party (PPP) and two senior coalition partners guilty of electoral fraud for vote buying in last December&apos;s general election and barred the prime minister from office for five years. Another 59 executives from the three parties were also banned from political office, among them 24 MPs who will have to resign their seats. Immediately after the decision to disband the PPP and the Machima Thipatai and Chart Thai parties, Somchai said he would abide by the rule of law and stand aside, describing it as &quot;not a problem. I was not working for myself. Now I will be a full time citizen&quot;. The ruling coalition&apos;s six parties immediately said they would reform under a new banner, a move not barred by the constitution. The PPP&apos;s surviving MPs are to join Puea Thai (For Thailand) and choose a new prime minister next week. But the PAD leadership embraced the court&apos;s decision, perhaps grabbing an opportunity to save face and remove itself from the airport siege that has seen its backing among Thailand&apos;s metropolitan monarchist-elite dwindling. &quot;We have finished our duty,&quot; said the PAD leader Sondhi Limthongkul, who had branded the government a proxy of the ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. &quot;If a puppet government returns or a new government shows its insincerity in pushing for political reform, we will return.&quot; The warning and the government supporters&apos; decision to continue their own protests against yesterday&apos;s court ruling herald the prospect of further turmoil, though both sides will take a breather for King Bhumibol Adulyadej&apos;s 81st birthday celebrations in two days. &quot;The divisions are so deep, it&apos;s difficult to see how it could be over,&quot; said Giles Ungpakhorn, a political analyst at Bangkok&apos;s Chulalongkorn University, who described the court ruling as a &quot;judicial coup&quot; to strip the PPP of power.

The airports authority warned it would be several days before the arrival of the first international flight, though the hope is normal services will resume soon to take 230,000 trapped tourists home. As People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD) demonstrators \u2013 who wear yellow in reverence of the king \u2013 packed up their tents and bedrolls, survivors of the ousted government began deciding on an interim leader.

The court ruling has defused the immediate crisis but demonstrators have warned they will return if things do not go to their liking. &quot;We will come back when the nation needs us,&quot; said Somkiat Pongpaibul, a key leader of the PAD, which pits Bangkok&apos;s urban monarchist elite against the rural poor who voted the government into power.

Airports are supposed to be high security areas, but not here, not if you have enough people, enough weapons and the right backing (which is the army and, to a greater or lesser extent, the conservative forces behind the army). Sunday&apos;s attempt to send in the police ended up with the cops getting beaten back and having their tyres slashed.  The police were largely resistant to using force, after their previous attempt to clear Government House with tear gas led to the death of a protester (highly explosive Chinese teargas canisters were to apparently to blame). Meanwhile, the Thai Chamber of Commerce suggested businesses refuse to pay their taxes until the government got the airport open. So the police were basically damned if they did and damned if they didn&apos;t. Politics in Thailand has in the past functioned via relatively weak coalition governments deferring to the holy trinity of the army, the bureaucracy and the monarchy. This changed with Thaksin, who became popular enough with the rural poor to achieve a large majority for his party (TRT). Able to push through any law he wanted, he deferred to no one, and by putting his people into all of the top positions within reach (the army, the legislature, etc), set about turning himself into a Thai version of Singapore&apos;s Lee Kwan Yew. He was the self-styled &quot;CEO of the Nation&quot;. (Note the implication of that title \u2013 the Thai citizens are his employees?) He ran a war on drugs that reduced the amount of amphetamine use in the country at the cost, it has been alleged, of very many police executions, often of the innocent, to achieve the quotas the police had been set.  He attacked press freedom, built Suvanaphumi Airport, the Skytrain, the underground, introduced cheap healthcare for the poor, and made sure all of his businesses did very well. (When he visited heads of state, it sometimes wasn&apos;t clear whether he was doing the country&apos;s business or Shincorp&apos;s.) Against a background of unease (largely middle-class) over the way Thaksin had centralised power, the protests of PAD began. From the start, they tried to ally themselves with the monarchy in the eyes of the people \u2013 for example, wearing yellow, the king&apos;s colour. It is not clear how much this support was actually reciprocated. When the PAD protester was killed by the teargas canister, the queen paid for her funeral, attended, and described the woman as a &quot;defender of the monarchy&quot;. Thaksin&apos;s reply to PAD&apos;s initial protests was to hold an election, which he inevitably won. There was some vote-buying by the TRT, and by everyone else, as there always is, but overall the election underlined his safety.  However, appointing his people to the top jobs in the army was a step too far. Hence the coup. When the post-coup elections were eventually held (with Thaksin holed up in England), they were won by a new party (the PPP) consisting mostly of ex-TRT MPs. The leader, Samak, was accused of taking his orders from Thaksin. Samak has now gone, having been found guilty of a conflict of interest (the conflict being the fact that he was paid for presenting a TV cookery show \u2013 count on a Thai court to keep a sense of perspective) to be replaced by Somchai, who, just for good measure, is Thaksin&apos;s brother-in-law. Somchai has now stepped down after the PPP was disolved by the Thai courts. Meanwhile, the PPP MPs left eligible by the courts have formed the Peuea Thai party, and are expected to form the same coalitions PPP did. This coalition will chose the next prime minister, and therefore leaves open the possibility of the protests starting all over again.  It&apos;s fairly clear that to win an election, you have to be allied to Thaksin in the mind of the people, whether or not you are following the man&apos;s actual instructions. The party of the holy trinity \u2013 the Democrats \u2013 led by Oxford-educated Abhisit is seen as an urban elite, out of touch with the concerns of the rural poor. Plus, over the last months, it has been fatally compromised by its closeness to PAD. Maj-Gen Chamlong Srimuang, one of PAD&apos;s core leaders, responded to this electoral lock-out by proposing a &quot;new politics&quot;, in which only 30% of the house is elected and the other 70% appointed by the great and good. The rationale is that the uneducated poor need to be protected from themselves. It will no longer matter if they vote for corrupt politicians: they will take what they are given. Meanwhile, just to add another element into the mix, the leader of PAD, a media mogul called Sondhi Limthongkul, is gradually starting to believe in his own culthood. Having convinced himself Thaksin was using Cambodian black magic from his mansion in Surrey, Sondhi performed a protecting ceremony involving placing used tampons around a statue of King Chulalongkorn. This is the man who shut down Thailand. One of the first things you are sure to be told, in this least nationalistic of countries, is that Thailand has never been colonised. But look closer. Thailand has, in a sense, been colonised by its own middle class, many of whom live in this country like colonial settlers. As with all colonisers, they see the true centres of culture and education as being elsewhere (the US, Britain, etc). They send their children to school abroad; they try to look as western as possible (white = attractive, brown = unattractive). They have the coloniser&apos;s exasperation and disdain for the natives, who are treated with paternal benevolence provided they know their place. Poverty in this setting is an ongoing problem; it is not to be solved but is to remain ongoing, since good works provide the middle classes with their validation: moments of up-country, genuine &quot;Thai-ness&quot;, before air-conditioned cars return them to their shopping malls.  To read the English-language Thai press is to appreciate the full depths of this disdain. From an article in the Nation (October 14 2008, before the airport takeover), written by Thanong Khantong, the Nation&apos;s editor, in favour of PAD&apos;s protests: &quot;I don&apos;t see Thailand backtracking against the democratic process ... It is a joke to believe that the rural voters love or have a better understanding of democracy than the Bangkok middle class ... The foreign media and foreign experts must stop distorting Thai politics with their convenient definition of democracy.&quot; From earlier in the article: &quot;A country can survive without democracy but it can&apos;t survive without law&quot; ... &quot;The politicians are the main problem and a liability in our democracy.&quot; The last two quotes are what I mean by fascism, since I don&apos;t know what else you&apos;d call it.  It is not possible to have contempt for democracy without first having contempt for people, since democracy is, after all, meant to deliver the people&apos;s will.

Within hours of the lifting of the blockade the first passenger service in a week arrived from the resort island of Phuket, and a Thai Airways flight left for Sydney. The end of the standoff - which left travellers frustrated and Thailand&apos;s tourist industry hamstrung - resembled a victory parade peppered with hugs and handshakes as the protesters declared they had won. Thousands of the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD) demonstrators left Suvarnabhumi international airport yesterday morning, a day after a court disbanded the governing party and barred the prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, from office for electoral fraud.  But as services resumed, the Thai airports&apos; authority said the arrival of the first three international flights would not happen until tomorrow - although the hope was that normal services could resume soon after to take home the estimated 230,000 trapped tourists. As PAD supporters, dressed in yellow as a mark of respect for the king, packed up their tents and bedrolls, government MPs met to choose an interim leader. The rump of the six-party coalition - led by the People Power party - plans to meet on Monday to select a new prime minister. It will be Thailand&apos;s third prime minister in three months and may spark fresh tensions. Although the end of the standoff has defused the immediate crisis, demonstrators warned they would return if need be, raising the spectre of further violence in the bitterly divided country. &quot;We will come back when the nation needs us,&quot; said Somkiat Pongpaibul, a key PAD member, an alliance of Bangkok&apos;s urban monarchist elite pitting itself against the rural poor who voted mainly for the government. There was a carnival mood yesterday as the remaining demonstrators sang and danced to a band on the makeshift stage outside the airport&apos;s departure areas. Queues formed before a table set up for PAD&apos;s co-founders, Chamlong Srimuang and Sondhi Limthongkul, who signed autographs. The international airport&apos;s manager, Serirat Prasutanond, predicted a speedy return to normality after inspecting the terminal.

King Bhumibol Adulyadej was due to address the country on the eve of his 81st birthday tomorrow and in the wake of anti-government protests that closed the country&apos;s main international airport for eight days. Suvarnabhumi airport&apos;s closure left more than 230,000 foreign travellers stranded. It reopened today with the departure of 36 aircraft, a fraction of its usual 700. The blockade of the international hub and Bangkok&apos;s Don Muang domestic airport was called off after a court sacked the prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, and disbanded the governing coalition for electoral fraud. Today, the government&apos;s spokesman said a parliamentary session scheduled for Monday to allow the six-party coalition to choose a new prime minister had been cancelled and a new date would be chosen. The session seemed set to inflame tensions as the surviving MPs from the disbanded People Power party and two other barred coalition partners had simply moved to new &quot;shell&quot; parties to enable them to conduct business as usual. Signs of frailty in the king - regarded as semi-divine - are a big cause for concern in Thailand. Its population is bitterly divided between the rural poor supporters of the government and Bangkok&apos;s monarchist-military elite, which backed the airport occupation. The world&apos;s longest-serving monarch has stepped in repeatedly during his reign to adjudicate, sometimes on the side of the military, sometimes for democrats. His absence from his traditional birthday address at a time of such heightened tensions is particularly alarming to Thais. Crown Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn reassured the kingdom over his health in remarks broadcast on national radio, explaining that the king had a throat infection and was weak but not seriously ill. &quot;Yesterday, when I saw him he looked OK,&quot; she said. &quot;He could eat and we served him, but today he had a throat infection so he could barely eat. Doctor prescribed him medicine and put him on a drip.&quot; Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, 56, who lacks the stature and popularity of his father, also addressed the country, passing on the king&apos;s thanks for his birthday wishes and urging &quot;everyone to have strong mental and physical health to perform their duties for the public&quot;. Concerns over the ageing king&apos;s health amplified fears of a potential political vacuum should he fall seriously ill so soon after the embarrassing airport debacle, which paralysed the vital tourist sector and damaged Thailand&apos;s export-driven economy. Tourists were still struggling to leave the country yesterday, with most forced to go through the overcrowded Vietnam war-era airbase of U-Tapao.

In a country whose leaders regularly consult astrologers and numerologists, that celestial smiley-face seemed auspicious to many after the following morning&apos;s events, when the constitutional court disbanded the ruling People&apos;s Power Party (PPP) and two of its coalition allies on charges of electoral fraud, leading to the resignation of the prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, and an end to the eight-day siege of Bangkok&apos;s airports by the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD). The crisis at the airports may be over but the political crisis in the country deepens; and it is a measure of its seeming intractability that some in Thailand looked heavenward for signs of relief. The PAD and their allies have now forced from office three democratically-elected governments in two years. There is little to suggest that this will be the last. Should fugitive former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra&apos;s allies re-constitute to form another ruling coalition under different party names (and all indications suggest that they will), the PAD and their armed security force will take to the streets again. Their leaders have promised as much. &quot;The PAD will return if another proxy government is formed or anyone tries to amend the constitution or the law to whitewash some politicians or to subdue the monarch&apos;s royal authority,&quot; Sondhi Limthongkul, one of the PAD&apos;s leaders, said on Tuesday, capturing succinctly the tensions and anxieties fuelling this crisis. This has never been an argument over the identity of the nation&apos;s political leader. It is an argument over the political identity of the nation. While the constitutional court ruling has defused the airport crisis, it has done little to resolve the argument over the country&apos;s political future \u2013 an argument of words and opinions that threatened this week to become a battle in the streets between Thailand&apos;s citizens. The PAD&apos;s criticisms and demands have never been limited to any particular government; they encompass the entire electoral process, with the emergence of Thaksin and his successors serving as primary evidence of its supposed flaws. The PAD seeks a radical restructuring of the country&apos;s political system \u2013 namely, a parliament composed primarily of appointees. PAD is therefore a misnomer. The protest leader&apos;s recommendations are often anti-democratic and anti-popular. Theirs is an autocratic if not occasionally fascist voice in Thailand&apos;s nominally democratic wilderness, and many believe that they have managed to rally the military and the palace&apos;s support to bolster that voice. When Queen Sirikit attended the funeral of a PAD supporter in October, many in the PAD interpreted her attendance as a tacit endorsement of the movement. (The queen also regularly supports the funerals of policemen and soldiers). It is the threat to the monarchy&apos;s authority in particular that has stirred such passion among the PAD&apos;s supporters, inflating Thaksin Shinawatra and his allies into political monsters of Judas-like, practically supernatural proportions. Thaksin, of course, is not the first corrupt politician to take charge of the country, by means fair or foul. Thai history is littered with corrupt leaders, democratically elected or otherwise, and charges of electoral fraud, for which the ruling party has been disbanded \u2013 under a constitution written with the 2006 coup leaders&apos; blessing \u2013 may be applied liberally to most political parties in the country. But the PAD find in Thaksin&apos;s overwhelming popularity among the rural poor, and the cult of personality that gathered around him during his tenure, a threat to the monarchy&apos;s authority. They accuse Thaksin and his successors not only of rampant corruption but also of plotting to overthrow the monarchy, a charge which Thaksin and his cronies vehemently deny. Nevertheless, it is the potent combination of both of these accusations, rather than charges of political corruption and nepotism alone, that has allowed the PAD to gather such political strength. In a country where convictions for lese majeste can result in up to 15 years&apos; imprisonment, claims of antagonism to the monarchy have historically carried enormous social and political power. Accusations of republicanism and lese majeste, for example, led to the mass lynching of leftists students in Bangkok&apos;s Sanam Luang by paramilitary groups in 1976; and in early November, a prominent social critic was arrested on similar charges. He remains imprisoned today. Make no mistake: the charges of corruption against Thaksin and his allies are well-founded. Thaksin&apos;s tenure in particular saw not only extraordinary government corruption and cronyism but also unpardonable human rights abuses. This latest legislative conviction, however, merely papers over the PAD&apos;s deep royalist anxieties about the monarchy&apos;s position in an electoral democracy. Given all of this, the PAD therefore continues to find fault not only with Thaksin Shinawatra and his allies but also with the rural population that continues to elect them: the movement&apos;s leaders have gone so far as to call the rural poor too ignorant and uneducated to vote in the country&apos;s best interest. It is class warfare in the guise of political reform. Their seizure of Bangkok&apos;s airports was a power-grab for the country&apos;s conservative business and royalist elites, and an incendiary rejection of the electoral voices of the rural poor, who have elected Thaksin and his successors repeatedly and overwhelmingly for close to a decade now \u2013 and will probably do so again when fresh elections are held early next year. Little wonder, then, that during the airport seizures red-shirted government supporters gathered in opposition to the yellow-shirted PAD. Shots were exchanged; bombs were thrown; knives and batons were at the ready. There were casualties on both sides. A widely-circulated video filmed on the day of the airport seizures showed a taxi driver being beaten by PAD men and pleading for his life as an assailant held a machete to his throat.  In the northern province of Chiang Mai, a local PAD supporter was dragged from his car, murdered, and beaten post-mortem by a group of red-shirted men. And on the night before the constitutional court&apos;s ruling \u2013 even as that smiley-face beamed above it all \u2013 a grenade thrown by an unknown assailant left one dead and 22 PAD protesters injured at Don Muang Airport.  The PAD may have begun as a movement to displace Thaksin and his allies, but its discourse \u2013 which often conflates the dangerous effectiveness of a corrupt political machine with the purported ineffectiveness of the rural poor&apos;s electoral intelligence \u2013 has created an enemy far larger and more difficult to contend with. Politicians may be exiled, banned, and disfranchised; populations, however, rarely do so without a fight. The PAD has won its self-proclaimed &quot;final battle&quot; against Somchai&apos;s government this week, but it may have also exacerbated the war. The tourists can now go home. But many of Thailand&apos;s citizens \u2013 clad in neither red nor yellow \u2013 may no longer be able to, regardless of any signs or wonders in the sky.", "publicationDate": "2008-12-04T20:30:02Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/dec/04/thailand1", "title": "Rattawut Lapcharoensap: Astrology and politics in Thailand", "sentences": ["In a country whose leaders regularly consult astrologers and numerologists, that celestial smiley-face seemed auspicious to many after the following morning&apos;s events, when the constitutional court disbanded the ruling People&apos;s Power Party (PPP) and two of its coalition allies on charges of electoral fraud, leading to the resignation of the prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, and an end to the eight-day siege of Bangkok&apos;s airports by the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD).", "Accusations of republicanism and lese majeste, for example, led to the mass lynching of leftists students in Bangkok&apos;s Sanam Luang by paramilitary groups in 1976; and in early November, a prominent social critic was arrested on similar charges.", "Their seizure of Bangkok&apos;s airports was a power-grab for the country&apos;s conservative business and royalist elites, and an incendiary rejection of the electoral voices of the rural poor, who have elected Thaksin and his successors repeatedly and overwhelmingly for close to a decade now \u2013 and will probably do so again when fresh elections are held early next year."]}, {"article": "Ill health forced the king of Thailand to miss a state-of-the-nation speech yesterday, which many had hoped would soothe the country&apos;s tensions.

For the past week, teams from 56 nations \u2014 48 men&apos;s teams, eight women&apos;s for the first time \u2014 have been competing in the sixth Homeless World Cup in Melbourne. Dozens of frenetic four-a-side games are being played daily on purpose-built pitches in the heart of the city&apos;s entertainment district and on the banks of the Yarra River. The tournament&apos;s Australian hosts have put on quite a spectacle, from the opening parade through the city centre to the enthusiastic commentators and the choice of music before and after games \u2014 The Proclaimers for the Scots, Thin Lizzy for Ireland, World In Motion for the English, AC/DC for the hosts. Thousands of people are flocking to watch the games for free as lives \u2014 and perceptions \u2014 are being changed. It&apos;s the biggest tournament since the first Homeless World Cup in Austria in 2003, dreamt up by Mel Young, the founder of Big Issue Scotland. &quot;We&apos;re being taken more seriously each year,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s about credibility. At the beginning a lot of people were confused by the idea of a Homeless World Cup and asked me if I was crazy, but we&apos;re into our sixth year now and have proved that we&apos;ve arrived.&quot; Examples from close to home confirm the annual fixture&apos;s credibility: the FAI has awarded all Ireland players full international caps; The first minister Alex Salmond sent the Scottish team a letter wishing them well and declaring his pride at being associated with the reigning world champions; Manchester United provided one of their foundation coaches to the England squad. The efforts have been rewarded, with all three teams playing some of the best football. Scotland, after a nervy penalty shoot-out defeat to Afghanistan in their first game, have gone on a winning streak that has them believing they can become the first nation to retain the trophy. The striker Michael Brannan, a 28-year-old recovering addict from Glasgow, said: &quot;It&apos;s amazing. The experience of coming to Australia and playing for my country is a dream come true.&quot; Men and women from Malawi to Mexico, Lithuania to Liberia, Philippines to Portugal are realising similar dreams in Melbourne. The tournament, which is open to people who have either been homeless at some point in the past year, make a living as a street paper vendor, are current or former asylum seekers or in drug or alcohol rehabilitation and have been homeless at some point in the past two years, is full of people with incredible tales to tell. Tawanda Karasa, Zimbabwe&apos;s manager, said: &quot;Our players come from squatter camps, some have lost their parents. Coming here is a lifetime opportunity for them. &quot;This will create an awareness of the issues we&apos;re facing in Zimbabwe while the players can be proud to have represented their country. When they return, they will be treated with respect and dignity.&quot; Before he can continue, a group of 11-year-old schoolchildren sweep him away, launching into an impromptu chant of &quot;ZIM ZIM ZIMBABWE!&quot; It is moments such as this that encapsulate what the founders are trying to achieve. There was also the steward who, after asking the Nigerian team and their support to calm their foot-stomping celebrations for fear of causing a temporary stand to collapse, was overheard explaining apologetically to her colleagues that she wished she could have let them continue. Then there was the tale of the Malawi team \u2014 competing at a World Cup for the first time \u2014 who took four days to arrive from Africa because of the protests at Bangkok&apos;s airports. It was an ordeal that would have tested the patience of the most seasoned traveller, let alone people taking their first ever flight, yet on arrival they ran to Mel Young, embraced him and told him how overjoyed they were to be at the tournament. There was the time Cambodia&apos;s wisp of a goalkeeper lost a boot and the game had to be stopped so he could ask a member of the coaching staff to undo and re-tie his laces. And when the tears flowed after they won their first match against Sierra Leone. &quot;Look at them,&quot; said Gaye Miller, the Australian who brought the team of teenage street orphans over to Melbourne. &quot;They&apos;re just little scraps who&apos;ve come from nothing.&quot; The sight of the former international referee Kim Milton Nielsen running the line in matches was arresting and that is why the likes of 66-year-old Scot Jim Gibson, originally from Clydebank but living in Melbourne, come to watch one game and end up staying for hours, if not days. &quot;It&apos;s fast-paced non-stop action,&quot; he said. &quot;When I first saw Scotland and they played Flower of Scotland before kick-off I had tears in my eyes.&quot; The players appreciate the support. The Irish captain Ross Crosbie, a 29-year-old recovering addict, says he feels like a celebrity. &quot;People used to run away from me but now they want photos.&quot; Crosbie, once isolated from society by his drug use, is now able mix with people again. &quot;I&apos;m learning how to cope with life,&quot; he said. &quot;When we return to Ireland we&apos;re hoping to stay in touch and in years to come we&apos;ll all be able to look back with pride and say that we went to Australia and represented our country.&quot; He may have friends for life from other countries too. The Irish coaching staff, veterans of several Homeless World Cups, became friends with the Kenyans at a previous tournament and introduced the two groups of players when the teams arrived in Melbourne. Shocked by the stories of the African players the Irish team had a whip-round and handed over $400, to much celebratory dancing. The Scots did the same for the Cambodians. &quot;You realise you&apos;re not really homeless when you meet people living in the slums of Africa because in Ireland someone will always find you a bed in a shelter,&quot; said 22-year-old Paul Farrell, a recovering drug and alcohol addict from Dublin. &quot;I was nearly in tears when we first met them to think that this still happens in this day and age.&quot; Despite tales such as this \u2014 and the fact that a great many of the players in previous tournaments have gone on to improve their lives \u2014 the Homeless World Cup still has its doubters, who question whether the money spent organising the tournament \u2014 around A$2.4m (\u00a31.05m) \u2014 and getting the teams to Australia could have been better spent elsewhere: on providing more homes or programmes to deal with homelessness. But, for Young, the benefits of the tournament, both in terms of tackling homelessness and financially, far outweigh those concerns. &quot;Homelessness isn&apos;t just about getting a house. People have become so marginalised in the process of becoming homeless that even if they get a house they might not be ready for it. This is a method of giving people life skills so they develop confidence and self-esteem. You can spend money on housing but I&apos;m not convinced it would solve the problem.&quot; He points to studies into the cost to society of homelessness and says research in New York found that on average each person living on the streets for a year cost $40,000 (\u00a327,000); in the UK similar research estimated the cost at \u00a3100,000 once police checks, health care, time in jail and hostel fees are taken into account. The organisers have been talking to spectators at the past two events, and found an overwhelming number of respondents said the tournament had changed their attitudes to homeless people. What&apos;s more, the cost of the Homeless World Cup pales in significance to conventional sporting events and the money pouring in from sponsors such as Nike and Uefa would have been channelled elsewhere without this event. The Street Soccer programmes it has spawned across the globe are booming; 3,000 people attended trials for the Homeless World Cup in Kenya alone. And, with the support of sponsors and, in particular, the Big Issue, players are going on to find jobs and homes. They are returning to their families and becoming mentors. Several former players have come back as their country&apos;s coaches. A French player went on to become a coach at Paris St Germain, but he still takes a week&apos;s holiday every year to work at the tournament. Plans are already in place for next year&apos;s tournament in Milan where there will be another women&apos;s tournament after the success in Melbourne. &quot;Professional players should come and look at the spirit in which the game is played here,&quot; said Young. &quot;It gives you faith in human nature.&quot; His sentiment is echoed throughout. Despite occasional discretions \u2014 England cancelled one pre-tournament coaching session at a Melbourne school to hold an extended team meeting over disciplinary concerns, the Scots dropped three of their players for the opening defeat after they broke a 10pm curfew while at least one player has disappeared and is expected to claim asylum \u2014 players from the most troubled of backgrounds have behaved impeccably. As the England player Romain Coleman, 23, from Birmingham, said: &quot;It&apos;s all about unity \u2014 how one ball can bring nations together.&quot; For more on the Homeless World Cup, visit www.homelessworldcup.org.

They take over the country&apos;s main airport, severing links with the outside world and throwing away millions in lost revenue from trade and tourism. They denigrate parliament, abuse voters as fools who should be stripped of their political rights, and make violent threats against anyone daring to stand in their way. In any other country, their feet, in the British army phrase, would not have touched the ground as they were hurried off for trial and well-deserved imprisonment.  But this is Thailand, where for two years a murky political conflict, played out both in the courts and in the streets, has been unrolling. In this strange drama, the police make no arrests, the military look the other way, and the judiciary shapes its decisions according to cryptic clues from behind the scenes. At one level the conflict is a personal one between a populist politician, Thaksin Shinawatra, and his followers, and a populist king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, and his family and advisers, both competing for the adherence of the rural masses, and both wishing to preserve for themselves the final political say. At another, it is a clash between the country&apos;s poorer, less educated classes, and the established Bangkok elites.  Thai country people used to refer to politicians as flightless birds. Each vote cast for them was like a feather, and when a politician had gathered enough he soared away to Bangkok, and you never saw him or heard from him again. But Thaksin, who invites comparison with such figures as Peron and Berlusconi, was different. He delivered and, in return, his rural voters have remained remarkably faithful, repeatedly voting for him, and for those he left in charge of his party after he was exiled. These verdicts were not acceptable to the other side. They have just succeeded, for the third time, in getting a prime minister banned from politics, but the problem is that no sooner are the Thaksin forces shown out of the front door than they reappear at the back. This being Thailand, the violence, while not absent, has so far been limited. But it is a dangerous situation, and one in which the king and the royal family bear a special responsibility. Thais had been waiting for a signal from him this week when he was due to speak on the occasion of his 81st birthday, but he did not appear.  Whatever the nature of his indisposition, this serves to underline the fact that the era characterised by his astute political manoeuvring is coming to an end.

Although talks are described as &quot;very early&quot; and several other companies are also in the frame, Etihad&apos;s links to the Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG) have established the airline as the front-runners to replace Thomas Cook as shirt sponsors. No figures have been agreed but City&apos;s immense financial power and marketability since ADUG&apos;s takeover has made them an attractive proposition going into a period when the club are expected to break spending records. That has led to several approaches from potential sponsors and means a new agreement could be the biggest of its kind in English football, beating Manchester United&apos;s \u00a356.5m four-year deal with AIG. Etihad is run by the Abu Dhabi government and, like City, backed by the royal family. The deal, however, would be a commercial one rather than just an opportunity to use one company to promote another. It would also be a further sign of the expansion into the &quot;global brand&quot; that the club&apos;s executive chairman, Garry Cook, spoke about earlier this season when it first became apparent that Thomas Cook&apos;s annual \u00a32.3m sponsorship deal would not be renewed next summer. &quot;The market is worldwide,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;You look at our brand and our brand looks like Thomas Cook.

My first thought was that Richey&apos;s body had finally been found. Reading on, it was almost a relief to learn that his parents, 14 years after he disappeared, had been granted a court order for Richey to be legally &apos;presumed dead&apos;. I photographed the Manics on many occasions, and it only seems a few years since I was walking around Bangkok at night with Richey, looking for suitably grubby locations in which to photograph him. The first time was in Paris in March 1991, early one morning. They&apos;d been out all night; it suited them to look wasted. Later I shot them for their first NME cover.  I loved the trash aesthetic of the band. It was all very obvious: Marilyn Monroe, Andy Warhol, and Jane Mansfield - tragic blondes. My idea was to shoot them lying on gold lam\u00e9 cloth.  I wanted it to look slightly tacky, camp. They arrived at the studio sporting several fresh love bites. Richey told me that they&apos;d been to some club the night before and asked girls to bite them in order that they&apos;d look sleazier for this, their most important photo session to date. I wrote &apos;Culture slut&apos; on Nicky Wire&apos;s chest in lipstick while Richey stared at himself in the mirror and scratched three letters into his neck with a school compass: VIH. I asked him what it meant.  &apos;Don&apos;t you know what HIV is?&apos; he asked. &apos;Er, yes. But you&apos;ve written it back to front.&apos; Richey was always a delight to photograph - he would do anything I asked of him. On one occasion I bought a rubber stamp featuring a Warhol-style picture of Marilyn Monroe&apos;s face and he let me stamp it all over his body.  Another time I photographed him clutching a statue of a nymph in a garden. While I was shooting he drifted off into his own world. He was holding the statue so tightly his knuckles went white. Tears streamed down his cheeks.  I felt guilty. I felt like I was intruding on a part of his life that was no business of mine. I was wondering how to tell him the session had finished - how to break the spell - when I heard Nicky Wire laughing. He shouted: &apos;Fucking hell, Richey.

The terrain isn&apos;t that challenging - so why is the pace slow? Specialist Cradle Huts runs tours, but is very expensive.Barbara Welford, by email  A Every estimate available agrees that five to six days is a reasonable length of time to cover the Overland Track which meanders through the Cradle Mountain, pictured above, Lake St Clair National Park and Tasmania&apos;s World Heritage Wilderness Area. Even though Cradle Huts (www.cradlehuts.com.au) has a six-day walk for $2,500 (\u00a31,200) with private huts, warm showers and guides, the trek is still not to be underestimated. Bad weather including snow - even in summer - is common. Independent hiking is possible but you&apos;ll need to carry everything with you. See the Overland Track FAQ at http://bit.ly/yUv7.

Q My wife and I recently returned from Thailand after being stranded there for a week because of the anti-government protests. We would like some advice regarding refunds from our airline EVA Air. We have had a lot of trouble trying to contact EVA - it took us five days and \u00a3250 of phone calls to get through - and we&apos;ll never fly with them again. On the other hand, staff at the Sheraton hotel in Krabi were fantastic and reduced their room rates for the extended stay. We&apos;d like to know if it is the norm to try to claim back the charges, and what our chances are of reclaiming our total costs of \u00a3700. Mr and Mrs Cherrington-Cook, by email A You have my sympathies for what must have been a very trying week. However, since many insurers are refusing to cover costs incurred by travellers stranded in Thailand you seem to have few options for claiming back this money. Your airline is unlikely to be willing to refund monies either for airfares or for additional costs incurred by you. I haven&apos;t been able to find any airline that was offering to pay out on anything related to the closure of Bangkok airport. As circumstances were beyond their control, they would argue that they have fulfilled their contract with you by getting you home at the first possible opportunity. Q We are considering visiting my brother in La Crucecita, southern Mexico, for a week or so around Easter. We&apos;d also like to do something cultural in Mexico City for a few days but neither of us speaks more than very basic Spanish and the thought of tackling one of the biggest cities in the world is a bit daunting. Could you advise us on travelling between there and La Crucecita, and suggest a tour firm who could organise things for us in Mexico City? Steve and Lisa Wood, by email A La Crucecita is the main service and transport town for the Bahias De Huatulco resorts in Oaxaca state. Flights with Mexicana start at \u00a3144 and are bookable at mexicana.com. Your brother may be able to book cheaper charter flights locally. Buses from Mexico City take around 14 hours and cost from \u00a325, though you should certainly consider upgrading to deluxe services if available. John Noble, author of Lonely Planet&apos;s Mexico guidebook, has some suggestions on visiting the capital. He says travellers &apos;can visit Mexico City safely, and the vast majority do. Many are surprised at how peaceable and normal the city seems. At least 10 tourist information offices are dotted around the city and English-speaking tourist police patrol the historic centre&apos;. He says visitors should &apos;use licensed taxis organised by their hotel rather than hailing cabs on the street&apos;, and take an official &apos;Transporte Terrestre&apos; taxi from the airport to the hotel. Leave valuables at home or at the hotel. Journey Latin America (020 8747 8315; journeylatinamerica.co.uk) is one well-established UK firm offering specialised travel services in Mexico. It can book hotels and internal flights. If you want airport transfers or local guides, start with your hotel for recommendations. If you&apos;re looking for an alternative to Mexico City, Noble recommends Oaxaca which, he says, &apos;boasts some charming and good-value places to stay, great restaurants and cafes (and cooking classes), a truly vibrant arts and crafts scene, and top-drawer museums, markets, galleries, colonial architecture and archaeological sites&apos;. Oaxaca is a half-hour flight or eight-hour bus ride from Huatulco. Q Having been stationed on Christmas Island in the Pacific with the RAF in the 1960s, my husband has expressed a wish to revisit the area. I&apos;ve managed to find out that the weekly flights to the island from Honolulu have been suspended because the runway at the island&apos;s airport is closed due to a cracked surface. Is there any painless way to fulfil my husband&apos;s wish? Morag MacCallum, West Lothian A Christmas Island is one of the remote Line Islands group belonging to the Pacific Ocean nation of Kiribati. Also known by its local name of Kiritimati, this is a tricky place to get to. The island was linked to both Nadi in Fiji and Honolulu in Hawaii by a weekly Air Pacific flight, but as you note this is currently suspended. Until this is repaired the only flights in or out of Christmas Island are by weekly charter Gulfstream jet from Honolulu. This jet is small enough to be able to land safely. The Kiribati National Tourist Office (00 686 81 091; tourismxmas@tskl.net.ki; visit-kiribati.com) can provide contacts for this service, but availability is very limited. The tourist office suggests normal air services should resume in February.

Eton and Oxford-educated Abhisit, who heads the opposition Democrat party, gathered 235 votes against 198 by the former national police chief Pracha Promnok, a loyalist of the exiled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Today&apos;s vote followed six months of instability caused by anti-government demonstrations that culminated late last month with a week-long takeover of Bangkok&apos;s two airports. Protests erupted again today as hundreds of pro-Thaksin supporters attempted to block parliament after the vote. The demonstrators threw rocks at vehicles but most dispersed peacefully, saying they would gather again later today in the capital&apos;s historic section. Some protesters in the crowd vowed to return to parliament in two weeks to disrupt Abhisit&apos;s maiden speech. Chanting &quot;Abhisit, army nominee&quot;, the red-shirted demonstrators denounced the new prime minister as a frontman for the military, which ousted Thaksin in 2006 and has been accused of political meddling ever since. Abhisit won support from 235 MPs from his Democrat party and a range of others, including a breakaway faction of the Puea Thai party that had backed Thaksin, who was convicted earlier this year on a conflict of interest charge. He needed a minimum of 219 votes to become prime minister. Abhisit has said reviving growth through increased government spending will be his priority. At a news conference immediately after the vote, he said he would not outline any ideas or initiatives until he was sworn in by King Bhumibol Adulyadej. He has suggested there could be some reallocation of regional spending, but that would be sure to outrage voters in the populous north and north-east, where support for Thaksin and loathing of Abhisit runs deep. Abhisit retains strong links with the UK: he was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and is a fan of Newcastle United football club. At 44, he is one of the youngest world leaders. Despite today&apos;s protest outside parliament, analysts foresee relative stability in coming months after political chaos and the airport siege, which ended after a court ruling two weeks ago dissolved the ruling People&apos;s Power party (PPP) and two coalition partners. The remnants of the PPP regrouped as the Phuea Thai party. The anti-Thaksin protest movement wants to purge politics of the former PM&apos;s influence and had threatened new but unspecified action if parliament elected a leader with links to him. Abhisit and his party enjoy strong support from the middle classes and many in the business sector. But Sukhum Nuansakul, a political scientist at Bangkok&apos;s Ramkhamhaeng University, said the hopes of many for a respite from political instability were likely to be short-lived. &quot;The fundamental problem has not been resolved,&quot; Sukhum said. &quot;A Democrat win sets the stage for another round of street protests, this time by pro-Thaksin groups.&quot; Panithan Wattanayagorn, a political analyst from Bangkok&apos;s Chulalongkorn University, predicted Abhisit would face &quot;among Thailand&apos;s roughest premierships&quot;. He said: &quot;His leadership qualities are untested. He has not suggested a bold solution [to the crisis]. A lot of people have no patience for that, especially when public opinion is so extreme on both sides. That is his weakness and that lack of decisiveness and clear political stance could turn against him very quickly.&quot; Thaksin&apos;s popularity among the rural masses remains strong even though he now lives in exile, having fled Thailand in October before he was convicted. He continues to play an active role in politics, and on Saturday he gave a pre-recorded video speech to a rally of more than 40,000 supporters at a stadium in central Bangkok. Thaksin decried inappropriate interference in the political process \u2013 a reference to the army&apos;s alleged intervention in favour of the Democrats \u2013 and denounced politicians who had been loyal to him but switched their allegiances. The army traditionally wields a great deal of influence in Thai politics. Abhisit told reporters yesterday his party would focus on national harmony and economic issues. Thailand&apos;s economy has taken a battering due to the global slowdown, a local climate of uncertainty and the seven-day stoppage of international flights that battered the country&apos;s essential tourism industry and stranded upward of 300,000 travellers. Some economists are predicting that south-east Asia&apos;s second-biggest economy will slip into recession next year.

Will his election end the turmoil in Thailand? In the short term, probably yes. The arrival of Abhisit is likely to calm the tensions that culminated in the eight-day shutdown of Bangkok&apos;s main international airport after it was invaded by yellow-shirted demonstrators from the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy. The demonstrators were opposed to the previous government of Somchai Wongsawat. His People Power party \u2013 which was allied to the exiled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra \u2013 is loathed by the Bangkok royalist metropolitan elite, which favours Abhisit. And in the longer term? Abhisit&apos;s election highlights the bitter divide in Thai society. Red-shirted opponents of Abhisit protested outside parliament today when they heard of his election. They and their followers among the rural poor feel they have been robbed by the courts, which disqualified two of their prime ministers in three months. But they are unlikely to take to the streets in the same way as their yellow-shirted rivals for the time being as they were hit hardest by the slowdown brought about by the airport closure that could shave 1% off growth rates next year. Can Abhisit bring something new to Thai politics? Politically it is difficult to say what Abhisit is about, although he presents a clean image in the rough and tumble of dirty and corrupt Thai politics. As leader of the Democrats \u2013 Thailand&apos;s oldest party \u2013 he pulled off a stunning coup in luring Thaksin loyalists across the floor of the house, belying his Eton and Oxford background. Known as &quot;Mark Vejj&quot; to British friends unable to pronounce his full name, he was a school contemporary of the London mayor, Boris Johnson, and a year ahead of the Conservative leader, David Cameron. Born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne to two medical professors, he remains a fan of the city&apos;s football team. So much for Abhisit, what about his government? Away from its leader&apos;s good looks, which made Abhisit a housewives&apos; choice, the Democrat party is stuffed with old powerbrokers in the traditional mould of Thai politics. It has now been saddled with an unwieldy coalition of interests said to have been offered \u00a31m each for their votes, the going rate for crossing the floor.

Abhisit Vejjajiva, 44, who was schooled at Eton and Oxford, hopes to calm the tensions that have beset Thailand since loyalists of the deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra took power earlier this year. Within minutes of his selection - by 235 votes to 198 - hundreds of red-shirted protesters showed their anger, throwing rocks at police barricades and laying siege to the parliament building to prevent MPs from leaving. The vote in favour of the minority Democrats - Thailand&apos;s oldest party - was a stunning coup. Thaksin loyalists were persuaded to cross the floor to support Abhisit, who was a contemporary of the London mayor, Boris Johnson, at Eton and a year ahead of the Conservative leader, David Cameron. Once Abhisit is formally endorsed by the revered King Bhumibol Adulydej, he faces an uphill task to unite a country bitterly divided between his supporters among Bangkok&apos;s urban elite and those among the rural poor who backed Thaksin and the last government. This faultline in Thai society was at its most visible two weeks ago when demonstrators from the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD) opposed to the then prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, seized the capital&apos;s main airport and shut it down for eight days, stranding 350,000 foreign travellers. Somchai was barred from office by the Thai courts - which critics maintain are in the sway of the royalist military elite - when his People Power party was found guilty of buying votes. Opponents said it amounted to a &quot;judicial coup&quot;. But Somchai stepped down, making him the second prime minister banned in the space of four months after Samak Sundarvej suffered the same fate for hosting a television cookery show. In the short-term at least, Abhisit&apos;s opponents among the rural masses are unlikely to take to the streets in the same fashion as their yellow-shirted PAD rivals, who are better organised and financed. For Newcastle-upon-Tyne-born Abhisit - known as &quot;Mark Vejj&quot; to schoolmates unable to pronounce his full name - there is also the tough job of managing the unwieldy coalition stitched together to win the vote. With the good looks that made him a housewives&apos; choice beloved of magazines, his clean image is refreshing in the dirty and corrupt world of Thai politics. But the Democrat party, out of office for eight years, is still stuffed with old powerbrokers in the traditional mould. Abhisit said a key priority would be to shore up the faltering export and tourism-driven economy, which took a big hit with the airport closure that economists believe may have helped push the country to the brink of recession. He may not get a chance to prove himself. Abhisit&apos;s slender majority may become thinner when byelections to choose 29 new MPs - to replace those sacked by the court ruling that brought down the government - are held on 11 January.

A charismatic and urbane man - known affectionately as &quot;Pak Ali&quot; - he was tipped to become the United Nations secretary general in the 1990s. But his boss, the Indonesian dictator Suharto, is said to have opposed the move, fearing it would shine a spotlight on the country&apos;s questionable human rights record in East Timor. Alatas was born in Jakarta. He graduated from the Academy for the Indonesian Foreign Service in 1954 and the University of Indonesia&apos;s law faculty two years later. A career diplomat, he was stationed in various embassies of Indonesia, including those in Bangkok and Washington DC, and he twice served as Indonesia&apos;s ambassador to the UN, in Geneva from 1975 to 1978 and in New York between 1982 and 1988. That year, in the final decade of Suharto&apos;s 32-year reign, he became Indonesia&apos;s foreign minister, serving another year under the dictator&apos;s successor, BJ Habibie.  Successive Indonesian presidents, including the current incumbent, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, valued his long experience and unflappable nature. Each ensured that he stayed around as a foreign adviser. Most recently, he was instrumental in seeing that the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) enshrined the values of human rights and democracy in a charter that came into force this week. He was also a board member of the Brussels-based International Crisis Group. Alatas was in recent years a UN special envoy tasked with drafting a report on security, development and human rights. But his soaring diplomatic career was always tarnished by Indonesia&apos;s abuses in East Timor, after it invaded and occupied the former Portuguese colony once it had achieved independence in 1975. Alatas&apos;s diplomatic skills were tested to the full by the Suharto regime&apos;s often brutal repression in East Timor, and elsewhere. Alatas admitted that the 1991 massacre of pro-independence demonstrators by Indonesian troops at the Santa Cruz cemetery in the capital, Dili, in which hundreds of civilians died, was a &quot;turning point&quot;. Even nations that had supported Indonesia were &quot;shocked&quot; by the carnage, which was captured on film by Max Stahl, a British journalist and documentary maker. It led to Indonesia&apos;s isolation by the west for years. International outrage over the deaths may have cost Alatas the top UN job, for which he was in the running in the late 1990s. Suharto reportedly vetoed his candidacy as he believed the role would have highlighted such abuses.  After his long stint as foreign minister under Suharto, who was swept from power in May 1998 by mass street protests, he served just one year as Habibie&apos;s senior diplomat. But it was an uncomfortable time; Habibie failed to consult him, notably on the decision to stage a referendum on East Timor that ended Jakarta&apos;s 24-year occupation in 1999. The mayhem that ensued, when more than 1,000 East Timorese died as Jakarta-backed militias went on the rampage, were a further stain on Alatas. In 2001, Alatas compiled a book, A Voice for a Just Peace that contained a selection of his speeches with some commentary, though only one passage on East Timor was included. It also highlighted Indonesia&apos;s desire for economic and social justice on a global scale, demanding an end to nuclear testing and the reform of the UN to end superpower domination. Indonesia&apos;s wish to discuss &quot;moral&quot; alternatives on the world stage was, however, blighted by East Timor. Yet five years later, Alatas&apos; ground-breaking work, The Pebble in the Shoe: The Diplomatic Struggle for East Timor, helped stir a wider debate about the occupation and forced Indonesia to start to re-examine its rule there. Some successes helped to underpin Alatas&apos;s reputation as an international statesman. His greatest triumph was his work with the Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen, who had been appointed by the invading Vietnamese in 1978; Alatas brokered the historic 1991 peace settlement at the Paris International Conference to end the war with the Khmer Rouge, though he had to share some of the glory with France, which joined the negotiations late in the day. Less successfully he also battled hard with Asean neighbour Burma for the release of opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who has spent 13 of the last 19 years under house arrest.  Alatas is survived by his wife and three daughters. \u2022 Ali Alatas, diplomat, born November 4 1932; died December 11 2008", "publicationDate": "2008-12-17T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Indonesia", "Cambodia", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/17/ali-alatas-obituary-indonesia-cambodia", "title": "Obituary: Ali Alatas", "sentences": ["A career diplomat, he was stationed in various embassies of Indonesia, including those in Bangkok and Washington DC, and he twice served as Indonesia&apos;s ambassador to the UN, in Geneva from 1975 to 1978 and in New York between 1982 and 1988."]}, {"article": "How much of a shopper are you?

But the source of excited anticipation was a political rally, not a football match. About 55,000 had packed the arena, many to acclaim Thaksin Shinawatra, the man they still see as the country&apos;s democratically elected leader. In a pre-recorded video message, Thaksin claimed the political woes of Thailand would come to an end only if the country&apos;s military ceased to meddle in political affairs. The crowd roared its approval. Before his enforced exile after being convicted in absentia for corruption, these were Thaksin&apos;s people. The strong smell of chilli rose from the woks of the food stalls, as giggling schoolgirls used their phones to take pictures of a group of policemen posing, their uniform shirts open to the waist to reveal, surprisingly, the red T-shirts of his supporters beneath. Families gathered to eat ho mok pla, the spicy seafood souffl\u00e9s, barbecue chicken and som tam, and booksellers and T-shirt sellers hawked their goods. A crocodile of teenage boys wended its way through the crowds with a poster depicting the Democrat party leader and new prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, as a reptile. An old woman was cheered as she struck the poster with one of her shoes - one of the rudest gestures a Thai can make. If the red-shirted crowds were in an angry mood last Sunday, it is hardly surprising. During the 80s and 90s, Thailand was a country on the rise. The economy boomed, incomes rose and tourists arrived in their thousands. Under the populist Thaksin, according to supporters, in recent years the wealth finally began to be spread around. That was then. Last week, in a vote skewed by the expulsion of 29 MPs over vote-buying allegations, Thailand&apos;s parliament voted for a new prime minister - its fifth in a little over two years - in the latest attempt to solve a political crisis that paralysed the country. This is a battle pitting the rural poor and their liberal allies against wealthy urban conservatives who now want to diminish the elected status of Thailand&apos;s parliament. It is fought on the streets between the left-wing red-shirts, whose power base is in the north-east, and the yellow-shirted royalists of Bangkok and the south. It is also a struggle for the soul of Thailand after Thaksin, the telecoms billionaire turned politician whose legacy has divided a country. The outcome will be studied with trepidation by a region with much to lose from the implosion of a former tiger economy. The appointment of the new PM - the Eton and Oxford-educated Abhisit - was judged by this crowd as effectively a coup performed by Thailand&apos;s urban moneyed elite, the armed forces and the right-wing People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (Pad), a curious grouping of royalists and a section of the Bangkok middle class. These were the yellow-shirted protesters who shut down Bangkok airport in order to force the previous Thaksin-friendly government out. The army and police refused to intervene and the Pad left the airport only after the constitutional court dissolved the government, paving the way for Abhisit&apos;s ascension. Pad is now demanding that the prime minister change the political system to allow 70% of any future parliament to be appointed, presumably in order to prevent further unpleasant surprises at the ballot box. In Bangkok stadium the talk is of a betrayal of democracy. &quot;Abhisit is a joke. Everyone is laughing,&quot; said Suphamee, a Bangkok housewife. &quot;He has not got this job in the correct way. We come every time to all the rallies to protect democracy. If everything is run by the generals and the rich there will be no law. We saw that when their people took over the airport. The generals let them do what they liked and never tried to stop them.&quot; These supporters of the fallen government, known as the khon sua sii daeng (the red-shirted people), are all too often dismissed as uneducated rice farmers from the north-east, but few were in evidence in this crowd. &quot;I&apos;ve never been involved in politics before, but now we have to do something. We are being affected directly by what they do, especially the closure of the airport,&quot; said Sarinee Nitanontawat, marketing director for a US company in Thailand. She and her friends were collecting, on their own initiative, names and addresses, mobile numbers and email addresses for a Barack Obama-style networking campaign. Abhisit, who squeaked over the line with a 37-vote majority in a parliament of 436, promises &quot;a grand plan of reconciliation&quot;, but few see how he can pull that off, hated as he is by such a large section of the electorate. The roots of the strife on Thailand&apos;s streets can be traced back to Thaksin, who used western-style political strategies to win the support of poor rural voters in the north-east, previously a largely ignored group, but one of the most important voting blocks in the country. It paid off. Thaksin became the first prime minister in the country&apos;s history to serve a full four-year term and then be re-elected in a landslide. It was a populist political triumph, albeit one tainted by allegations of corruption and vote-buying. It was also anathema to traditional power centres such as the military. The backlash took the form of a military coup and the dissolution of Thaksin&apos;s Thai Rak Thai (Thais Loves Thais) party in 2006. Thaksin&apos;s supporters did not give up. A year ago, in new elections, the People&apos;s Power party, featuring many former members of Thai Rak Thai, swept to power on the back of their votes. The battlelines were now drawn. Families, villages, communities and workplaces have all been turned upside down by the chaos, which continues. Even the monarchy, the cornerstone of modern Thailand, has come in for unprecedented criticism. While King Bhumibol Adulyadej remains idolised by nearly all Thais, there are growing grumbles about senior royalist officials who are seen as openly backing the Pad. It is a political baptism of fire for Abhisit, 44, the Old Etonian born in Newcastle upon Tyne who becomes the country&apos;s 27th prime minister. He is personable, clever, handsome and untainted by endemic Thai political corruption. But he lacks popular support and no one underestimates the mountain he has to climb. Tourism, representing 6% of the economy, lies in ruins. Arrivals that were supposed to be 20 million people by 2010 are now expected to be eight million for 2009. GDP growth, already downgraded for 2009 to 3%, may now be non-existent and hundreds of thousands of workers in exports are being laid off. Abhisit&apos;s political problems look, if anything, worse. He faces immediate scrutiny over the make-up of his cabinet, announced on Friday. In an interview with the BBC, an uncharacteristically touchy Abhisit said he had &quot;not sold his soul&quot;, but some of the appointments suggest he may have been forced to take out a heavy mortgage. Yesterday he unveiled his new cabinet on national television, having received the endorsement of King Bhumibol, and its members will be sworn in tomorrow. But its make-up offers few olive branches to his angry opponents. Abhisit owes his new job to intense horse-trading with his former enemies, in particular Newin Chidchob, a power broker of the old school with a scandal-ridden past and - until he crossed the floor - a close associate of Thaksin. Newin was not able to vote for Abhisit himself, after being banned from parliament on charges of vote-buying. He is now on bail on separate 1.44 billion baht (\u00a326.9m) corruption charges arising from a previous spell in government. Nevertheless, his proxies in parliament have been rewarded with two plum portfolios - transport and communications, with billions of pounds in lucrative infrastructure projects under their control, and the Interior Ministry. Abhisit may also find the Democrats&apos; links to the Pad something of a liability. One of his colleagues, Somkiat Pongpaiboon, is a Pad luminary, while his new foreign minister, former career diplomat Kasit Piromya, praised the closure of the international airport, which left more than 350,000 passengers stranded, as a &quot;new innovation for public protests&quot;, raising eyebrows even in Democrat circles. The Pad leaders have said they will continue to support Abhisit only if he reforms parliament. If he doesn&apos;t, they say, they will return to the airport. So much for the new prime minister&apos;s allies and supporters. Abhisit must also, of course, contend with the red-shirts like those who filled Bangkok stadium. Their leader is Veera Musigapong, 60, a softly-spoken, dark-skinned southerner who in the 80s was the Democrat party&apos;s secretary-general and deputy interior minister. No stranger to controversy, Veera lost that job after being jailed for l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 (one of four such spells in prison he has had under the country&apos;s draconian laws limiting comment on the royal family). He served a month before being pardoned by the king, but was banned from politics for five years. Nicknamed Kai Muk Dam (Black Pearl) for his maverick style and rousing public rhetoric, he then resurfaced with the New Aspiration party, which eventually merged with Thaksin&apos;s Thai Rak Thai, where he became an executive member of the party. Veera is still close to Thaksin and critics allege he is still funded by him, a claim he denies. Veera&apos;s office is a small crowded room, lined with a Buddha statue and images of revered monks, on the sixth floor of a suburban Bangkok shopping centre. Next door is the Major Bowl tenpin bowling alley and the scent of green curry wafted in from the stalls near by. &quot;We are going to be Abhisit&apos;s worst headache,&quot; he said. &quot;We will not accept him. He came to the job through injustice against the will of the people who did not vote for him. We have always vowed to protect the democratic system and that is what we will do. That is what we are protesting for - one man, one vote. It is as simple as that.&quot; According to Veera, the Pad&apos;s links to the Democrats should concern all Thais committed to universal suffrage. &quot;Some of those who voted for [Abhisit] and some in his party support the Pad, and that is totally unacceptable. The Pad wants to have parliament appointed. They don&apos;t want the people to have the power to vote for their leaders. &quot;A few protesters throw rocks after Abhisit is appointed prime minister and they are charged. The Pad close down the country for more than a week, attack and beat people and make threats and nothing happens to them. It is clear they have connections that protect them. All we want is one man, one vote, and for that principle to be respected.&quot; The contrasts between the urbane Abhisit and the rough-and-ready Veera are striking. The leader of the khon sua sii daeng has rarely travelled outside Thailand and speaks little English. The last time Abhisit went to the rural north-east that is Veera&apos;s heartland he was pelted with vegetables and driven away. Yet almost all observers agree that, if Abhisit is to gain any traction and win the popular mandate he so badly needs, he must take action to connect with ordinary Thais. Judging by his appointments since becoming prime minister, the chances of that are slim, particularly in the north. Last week, emerging from parliament minutes after Abhisit won his vote, Democrat MP Charoen Kanthawongs, a lawyer with the prominent firm Tilleke and Gibbins International, told a Malaysian newspaper, the New Straits Times, that he was not concerned by the opinions of the north-easterners who make up much of Veera&apos;s support. &quot;People in the north-east are employees of people in Bangkok,&quot; said Charoen Kanthawongs. &quot;My servants are from the northeast. Gas station attendants in Bangkok are from the north-east.&quot; The Democrats, with their own solid support in their southern heartland and Bangkok, hope instead to court the voters of the Central Plains. &quot;I think that strategy makes a lot of sense,&quot; said Chris Baker, a British historian and Thai political analyst. &quot;I think there is certainly room for the Democrats to capture quite a lot of support, but they need to get Abhisit out there. He is an asset but they have to make him visible.&quot; Some of the more thoughtful patrician Thais, while welcoming Abhisit for his intelligence and economic acumen, acknowledge that something has to be done to move the country to a more stable two-party system of government. It is a vision shared by one red-shirted investment banker, who did not want to be named because many of his clients are Democrat party, or Pad, supporters. But at the Bangkok stadium, he said the only way forward for Thailand was a good, clean fight between the red and yellow forces. &quot;I have never been involved in politics before, but I have come to two red-shirt rallies now. I am a capitalist through and through. But I believe true democracy is the only way to make money for everyone. The folks that have their wealth tied up as equity owners and shareholders in capital markets should realise this. I love this country and I love Thai people, but I cannot live in an undemocratic society.&quot; For now though, the colourful but destructive contrast of ideologies is set to continue. A huge red-shirt rally, called by Veera, is planned for next Sunday, the day before a policy statement by Abhisit. In response, the army has already warned that there should be no further &quot;confusion&quot; created in the country&apos;s politics. Thailand&apos;s long and painful political crisis is far from over. Anatomy of a crisis March 2005 Thaksin Shinawatra&apos;s new Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) party wins landslide victory. Early 2006 Thaksin sells his shares in Shin Corp, Thailand&apos;s biggest telecom group, for $1.9bn to Singaporean investors. Allegations of tax avoidance anger middle-class urban Thais.

September 2006 Thaksin steps down for a few weeks, but then returns to government. The military stages a bloodless coup while Thaksin is at the UN.

September Samak dismissed for breaching conflict of interest laws for appearing in TV cooking show. Succeeded by Thaksin&apos;s brother-in-law, Somchai Wongasat. October Thaksin convicted in absentia for breaching conflict of interest laws in land deal involving his wife.

One of these will be held on Christmas Eve. In the court American prosecutors will try, as they have for most of the past year, to have him removed to New York. They want to put him on trial for trying to collaborate with terrorists, the Colombian leftwing revolutionary movement Farc, to which the Russian (via an English envoy) reportedly tried to sell a huge arsenal of weapons in the course of assorted meetings in the Caribbean, Copenhagen, Bucharest and Bangkok. This is the tale of Viktor Bout, a larger than life character whose story tells of a darker side of globalisation. It might have been lifted from the pages of a John Le Carre novel and the tale has, already, provided material for one Hollywood blockbuster, Lord of War, starring Nicolas Cage. Bout labelled the film rubbish and said that he felt sorry for Cage (an actor whom the Russian otherwise likes, apparently). But it is most unlikely to be the last time that Bout sees himself portrayed, in some way or other, on the big screen. Look out for a new film about him starring Angelina Jolie as a determined UN arms trade investigator within the next year or two. Bout is an arms dealer and provider of large transport aircraft of some renown, who made himself extremely rich in the 1990s by trading all sorts of weapons and goods (including frozen chickens and precious flowers) in Africa, the Middle East and beyond. He is accused of breaking UN arms embargoes and of fuelling nasty civil wars by supplying a bafflingly wide array of combatants with weapons. He denies doing anything illegal and claims that for several years he has been out of the trading business. But Global Witness, a British activist group which has traced Mr Bout&apos;s career over the years, suggests that the Russian has been involved in wars across Africa and beyond. There is nothing that he hasn&apos;t done, sums up one spokesman. Bout enjoyed two big advantages: his access to a fleet of Soviet-era aircraft (which gave him the means to reach the most remote warlord or rebel army in the African bush) and his access to a huge stockpile of surplus Soviet weaponry (which gave him the goods to sell). One expert on his life describes him as a former member of the GRU, a part of Russia&apos;s secret service network (in British terms, a mix of the Special Air Services and MI6). In the 1990s he went into active reserve, making money by exploiting his close ties to the Russian military and his experience in Africa. He benefited, too, from a widespread neglect of Africa in the 1990s, when outside governments largely wrote off the continent as too poor and troubled to matter. That left political space open for private actors, mercenaries and arms traders to strike up close relationships with warlords, governments, rebels and more. From Africa he is accused of moving on, establishing a hub for his private airline in the Middle East, from where he became involved in flying goods to Afghanistan and later to America-run Iraq. Ironically, as one part of the American government was attempting to have Bout detained for his alleged nefarious dealings, another part of the American government was using Bout&apos;s services to fly goods to its soldiers in Baghdad. Bout may eventually be brought to New York, although the Russian government is determined to prevent that happening. If he does go on trial, perhaps next year, watch out for a colourful performance that may shed light on a whole range of dubious activities by African and western governments alike, by shady businessmen who prosper on the margins of wars and by intelligence agencies involved either in trying to pounce on Bout (which the British failed to do in Athens) or to use him as a partner in the fight against terrorists. Expect, too, the myth of Bout to grow. He is too strong a character to be neglected: he is dumpy, moustachioed, mysterious, intelligent (he speaks several languages fluently), mercurial (he reportedly has passports from five countries), anguished about conservation (he is said to be troubled about the state of the jungle in Congo and the plight of pygmies) and is rather charismatic. As important, as a Russian hunted by American prosecutors, he is caught within a story that has echoes of cold war clashes between the two large powers. No doubt the Americans are keen to see what intelligence value Bout might have, as well as to see justice done. The Russians are probably equally keen to prevent their citizen being taken to America for further investigations. Bout was nabbed by American Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents and Thai policemen after a remarkable sting operation that culminated in a luxury Bangkok hotel this year. That added another chapter to his incredible tale. The finale is yet to come. \u2022 Read a longer profile of Bout in The Economist&apos;s Christmas edition.", "publicationDate": "2008-12-21T16:00:00Z", "tags": ["Arms trade", "Russia", "World news", "Colombia", "Viktor Bout", "Europe", "Americas"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/dec/21/armstrade-russia", "title": "Adam Roberts on the extraordinary Viktor Bout", "sentences": ["This month a Russian businessman (as the Russian parliament likes to describe him) will sit through his latest extradition hearings in Bangkok, dressed in the prison garb of an orange T-shirt and shorts.", "They want to put him on trial for trying to collaborate with terrorists, the Colombian leftwing revolutionary movement Farc, to which the Russian (via an English envoy) reportedly tried to sell a huge arsenal of weapons in the course of assorted meetings in the Caribbean, Copenhagen, Bucharest and Bangkok.", "Bout was nabbed by American Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents and Thai policemen after a remarkable sting operation that culminated in a luxury Bangkok hotel this year."]}, {"article": "The man dubbed the &quot;Merchant of Death&quot; for his alleged arms smuggling activities took the stand today for the first time to fight extradition to the United States and deny charges that he conspired to arm Colombian rebels. Dressed in an orange prison uniform, Viktor Bout was shackled at the ankles but looked relaxed and spoke in mostly measured tones during his testimony at Bangkok&apos;s criminal court. The US is seeking the extradition of Bout, who was arrested in the Thai capital in a sting during which undercover US agents posed as Latin American rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or Farc. &quot;I never met or talked to anyone from Farc,&quot; Bout told the court. &quot;I didn&apos;t do anything wrong in Thailand. I have never been to Colombia or the United States.&quot; The 41-year-old Russian, who has long denied any involvement in illicit activities, was purportedly the model for the arms dealer portrayed by Nicolas Cage in the 2005 movie Lord of War. He was arrested in March at a Bangkok luxury hotel and subsequently indicted in the US on four terrorism-related charges. Bout identified himself to the court as &quot;a 41-year-old businessman&quot;. He spoke in Russian, which was translated to Thai. Asked to state his line of work, Bout replied: &quot;I am in aviation and construction.&quot; Bout said he had traveled to Bangkok &quot;to relax&quot; and to meet with &quot;a Thai businessman who wanted to buy airplanes&quot;. &quot;I did not commit any terrorist acts,&quot; said Bout, claiming he was a pawn in an American plot. &quot;The US is trying to use this to cover up its internal problems and prevent good relations between Thailand and Russia,&quot; he said, briefly raising his voice and shaking his finger as he spoke. He did not elaborate. At one point, Bout held up two fingers and flashed the victory sign to an acquaintance in the courtroom, where his mother and wife were present. After a two-hour testimony, the court adjorned for lunch and Bout smiled for cameras as police escorted him out. According to reports by UN agencies and several western governments, Bout has delivered arms to dictators and warlords in Africa and Afghanistan, allegedly breaking UN arms embargoes in the process. His extradition hearing started in June but has been repeatedly delayed, with a revolving door of defence lawyers. Bangkok&apos;s criminal court has said it expects the hearing to wrap up on Wednesday but one of Bout&apos;s lawyers, Preecha Prasertsak, said he planned to seek an extension to locate more witnesses. At an earlier hearing, an agent of the US Drug Enforcement Administration testified that his agency set up the operation that lured Bout from Russia to his arrest in the Thai capital. Robert Zachariasiewicz told the court that Bout faced US charges of conspiring to kill Americans, US officers or employees, conspiring to provide material support to terrorists, and conspiring to acquire and use an anti-aircraft missile. The maximum penalty is life in prison. The original arrest warrant issued in Thailand was based on a charge of using the country as a base to negotiate a weapons deal with terrorists. That charge was dropped in April and a second arrest warrant issued asking for his extradition to the US.

Josh Peck plays a busy pot dealer whose friendship with screwed-up psychiatrist Ben Kingsley provides the only working relationship in either of their lives.  Peck, talking like a blissed out Tim Westwood, has no friends, no sex life and no idea, but you get the hint that there&apos;s an ambitious nice guy buried under all his white boy, hip-hop front. Kingsley is also great value. Trapped in a loveless marriage and a meaningless career, he embarks on a cross between a midlife crisis and a full-blown mental breakdown. He accepts payment in drugs, takes up &quot;tagging&quot; and even attempts to get it on with hippy-chick Mary-Kate Olsen. This isn&apos;t a great film, but it is a good one. It&apos;s fun to watch, with uniformly excellent performances (Olivia Thirlby is one to watch as the object of Peck&apos;s fumbling lust). The old(ish) school hip-hop soundtrack, and the stylish, strangely nostalgic vision of the not-that-long-ago-really year of 1994 (apparently everything looked very brown in the 1990s) together provide an excellent framework for the characters&apos; hilarious, incident-filled and drug-fuelled adventures.

The demonstrators forced the new prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, to delay a speech outlining the new administration&apos;s key policies. &quot;If they want to go in they have to walk through us, including the prime minister,&quot; said one of the protest leaders, Chatuporn Prompan. The protest threatens to renew political turbulence that paralysed the previous government for months and climaxed in an eight-day occupation of Bangkok&apos;s airports. The protest group, which calls itself the Democratic Alliance Against Dictatorship, said it would stay at the parliament until the government called a snap election. The group had previously planned to stay for three days. &quot;We will celebrate New Year at parliament,&quot; Chatuporn said. The alliance has at least temporarily disrupted the government&apos;s plan to announce its policies, which by law it must do by 7 January. The deputy prime minister, Suthep Thaugsuban, said if the announcement could not be delivered today attempts would be made to enter parliament in the next few days, but through negotiation rather than force. &quot;We wish to deliver the policy statements before the end of the year,&quot; he said. The protesters, dubbed the &quot;red shirts&quot; for their protest attire, say Abhisit and his Democrat party came to power this month through a virtual coup d&apos;etat. The court ruling that dissolved the previous government, packed with Thaksin allies, was made under pressure from the military and monarchist forces, the group says. Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in September 2006 after being accused of corruption and abuse of power. &quot;We are here for democracy,&quot; said Narumol Thanakarnpanich, a 53-year-old university professor from Bangkok. &quot;We want a new government.&quot; Abhisit, the nation&apos;s third prime minister in four months, vowed in his inaugural address to reunite the deeply divided nation and restore Thailand&apos;s tourist-friendly image.

Abhisit Vejjajiva, who was elected in a parliamentary vote two weeks ago, had to deliver the speech before his government could formally start work on trying to revive an economy battered by political crises. Hundreds of red-shirted supporters of the ousted former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra moved to the ministry after news spread that Abhisit was there. But there were no clashes, the demonstrators abandoned the siege and the prime minister was able to leave shortly afterwards. In a speech broadcast live on television, Abhisit referred to repeated protests culminating in an airport blockade by anti-Thaksin demonstrators that crippled tourism and damaged Thailand&apos;s image. &quot;Political conflicts that have spread to civic groups could push the economy, along with the tourism industry, into recession if action is not taken quickly to resolve them and revive confidence among investors and foreign tourists,&quot; Abhisit said. &quot;These conflicts are the country&apos;s weakness, especially at a time the world economy is entering its worst crisis in a century.&quot; The demonstrators, angry at the dismissal of a pro-Thaksin government by the courts this month, had already forced the cancellation of the speech yesterday. They spent the night outside the gates of parliament, vowing to stay until Abhisit called fresh elections. The unrest in Thailand stretches back to 2006 when yellow-shirted protesters led by Bangkok&apos;s royalist and business elite triggered Thaksin&apos;s removal. Supporters of the exiled Thaksin accuse Abhisit of stealing power with the aid of the military, which they say pushed smaller parties to join his coalition two weeks ago. Abhisit denies this. The third prime minister in four months, Abhisit was formally named to the post on December 17 in what many hoped would be the end of months of turbulent, sometimes violent protests. But his party, which had been in opposition since 2001, heads a coalition that some analysts doubt is strong enough to last until the next general election in 2011. In his 50-minute speech, Abhisit outlined his plans to jump-start the economy, heal the country&apos;s political divisions, address a four-year-old Muslim insurgency in the south and repair Thailand&apos;s tattered image among tourists and business. &quot;There&apos;s no confidence among tourists who want to visit Thailand,&quot; said Prakit Chinamourphong, the president of the Thai Hotel Association. &quot;I just want to see a peaceful country without demonstrations so that the tourists will come back to Thailand again.&quot; The anti-Abhisit protesters call themselves the Democratic Alliance Against Dictatorship and are known as the &quot;red shirts&quot;. They are a mix of Thaksin loyalists, farmers and labourers from the cities, including the capital, Bangkok. Abhisit delivered his maiden speech less than a month after the last government was forced from office following six months of demonstrations by an anti-Thaksin group, the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy.
