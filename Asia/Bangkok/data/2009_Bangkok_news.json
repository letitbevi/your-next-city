The cause of the fire was unclear; some clubbers blamed it on fireworks while others said it had been caused by an electrical fault in the Santika club.  &quot;We were all dancing and suddenly there was a big flame that came out of the front of the stage and everybody was running away,&quot; Oh Benjamas told Reuters outside the smouldering wreckage of the club. Another told how the ceiling caved in, burying victims in the rubble.  Police Major General Chokchai Deeprasertwit said the fire may have been caused by firecrackers brought into the club by guests or by sparks flying from a pyrotechnics countdown on the stage. Chokchai said most deaths were caused by burns, smoke inhalation and injuries inflicted by the stampede to escape from the club, which had only one door for entry and exit. A firefighter at the scene, Watcharapong Sri-saard, said another door at the rear of the building was known only to staff. He said a number of staircases inside the club as well as bars across the second-floor windows had also made escape difficult. Dozens of bodies wrapped in white cotton sheets lay on the pavement outside the club as fire crews moved in. The Foreign Office said representatives were at the scene but it was unclear whether any Britons had been hurt. The club is based on Ekkamai, a street in central Bangkok&apos;s Thong Lor district, which is popular with foreign revellers and well-to-do Thais. Officials said many of the bodies had been charred beyond recognition. Rescue teams used pick-up trucks to ferry corpses from the scene while survivors were taken to 14 different Bangkok hospitals. Most of the bodies were found in the basement of the two-storey building.  The Thai capital was hit two years ago on New Year&apos;s Eve by a series of small explosions in which several people were killed and dozens injured. The blasts were blamed variously on fallout from the 2006 coup against the then prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, and Muslim militants who have waged a separatist rebellion in Thailand&apos;s southern provinces since 2003.", "publicationDate": "2009-01-01T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/01/thailand", "title": "At least 59 killed in fire at Bangkok nightclub", "sentences": ["At least 59 people died and more than 130 were injured in a fire at a Bangkok nightclub packed with New Year&apos;s Eve revellers, Thai police said last night.", "The club is based on Ekkamai, a street in central Bangkok&apos;s Thong Lor district, which is popular with foreign revellers and well-to-do Thais.", "Rescue teams used pick-up trucks to ferry corpses from the scene while survivors were taken to 14 different Bangkok hospitals."]}, {"article": "Dozens of charred bodies wrapped in white cotton sheets lay outside the Santika nightclub last night as the death toll in the Bangkok fire tragedy continued to rise and fire crews moved in to douse the embers of what remained of the building. At least 59 people who had gone to the club to welcome in the new year died in the blaze, which was thought to have been started by fireworks or an electrical fault; more than 130 were thought to have been injured.  Some of those who died had been trampled to death in the rush as clubbers surged towards the only open exit once the fire broke out. On the street outside, relatives of victims wept while rescue workers bundled bodies into the back of pick-up trucks to be driven away. One relative knelt on the pavement holding a dead loved one&apos;s hand as she lay on the pavement. Many of the victims were charred beyond recognition.  Survivors described how flames tore through the two-storey club, causing the ceiling to collapse and bury revellers in the rubble inside one of the city&apos;s top nightclubs. Oh Benjamas said guests were given sparklers as they entered the nightspot and fireworks were sprayed from the stage as people celebrated the new year. &quot;We were all dancing and suddenly there was a big flame that came out of the front of the stage and everybody was running away,&quot; Benjamas said. &quot;There was an explosion and people started running for the doors and breaking the windows.&quot; The bodies were propped up outside the club and laid in the street while taxi drivers and passersby joined in the rescue operation. Another guest, Tos Maddy, said he heard an explosion at around 12.30am, followed by a stampede for the exits. &quot;Everything went boom and people started running. The fire went very quickly,&quot; he said. Another clubber, who did not want to be named, said: &quot;People were falling over as they ran for the doors. They were being trampled on. It was horrific.&quot;  The injured were taken to 14 hospitals across the city and treated for various injuries. Montika Boontang, 28, spoke from her hospital bed where she was being treated for burns. &quot;I was in the bathroom and when I walked out, I saw flames in the roof and it fell to the floor,&quot; she said. A video given to AP Television News by one of the rescue workers showed bloodied, bruised and burned victims being dragged out of the burning club or managing to run through the door or shattered windows. Flames were racing through the building during the rescue operation and the roof of the concrete building later collapsed. Thai police say at least 59 people, including a number of foreigners, had died. Police say among the injured were nationals of Australia, Nepal, Japan and the Netherlands. The nationalities or number of foreigners reported to have died was not immediately known. The club was packed with about 1,000 people, the authorities said.  Rescue workers returned repeatedly to the club&apos;s basement where they believed up to 30 bodies remained in the rubble. Most of the dead were believed to be in their 20s. The club is based on Ekkamai, a street in central Bangkok, popular with foreign revellers and high-society Thais. Reviews of the club on the internet report that it attracts a mainly affluent Thai student crowd, &quot;with Euro models and westerners also popping in&quot;. Large speakers were suspended from the high-ceilings pumping out a mix of Thai music and international pop. The club is famous for its live band shows. According to its website, Santika is one of Bangkok&apos;s biggest mainstream nightspots, divided into two clubs. The bigger of the two clubs is decked out like a church with a big cross hanging on the wall, according to reviews. Bangkok&apos;s nightspots, some of which can accommodate several thousand people, have often been the subject of safety concerns although they have been incident-free for the last five years. &apos;Bodies were all around&apos; A British backpacker on holiday in Thailand described the aftermath of the Bangkok nightclub fire last night. Andrew Trainer, 26, from Southampton, had been at a nearby bar when he heard screaming and shouting and the wail of sirens. He told the Guardian: &quot;I ran into the street and could see smoke coming out of the building - there were people running out screaming. One girl ran out and you could see that she had been burned. Her clothes and face were black.  &quot;She collapsed on the street and her boyfriend was trying to revive her. He was kissing her cheek and crying. There were bodies all around, some were covered, some just lying there burned.  &quot;Another person ran out. She had her top ripped off in the stampede. She ran into the arms of a police officer. There were rescue workers going in and pulling people out on stretchers.

At least 200 people were also hurt in the blaze at the Santika club in the Thai capital&apos;s Thonglor district, including four British nationals, two of whom were in intensive care yesterday. But a diplomatic source said there did not appear to be any British deaths, contrary to earlier reports. Speaking from the intensive care unit of a private hospital in Bangkok as he was treated for burns and smoke inhalation, Alex Wargacki, 29, said the club was holding its closing party when the fire broke out. &quot;I guess I always knew the place was a bit of a death trap. But that&apos;s like so many places here. That&apos;s Thailand,&quot; he said.  Other survivors raised questions about the club&apos;s fire precautions, claiming there was no sprinkler system and that there were no signs pointing to the exits. The windows were also barred, they said. Wargacki, a City trader from north London, told how he was catapulted across the club at around 12:30am after someone lit a firework.  &quot;Suddenly to the right of the stage I saw a firework being let off among a crowd of partygoers. I shot right across the room,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t know exactly how long, but it seemed no time at all when the whole place, walls and ceilings were ablaze. &quot;Then everyone started running for the door. But the door seemed tiny and people were jammed up against it. If there was another way out, none of us knew about it, and all the windows were barred. &quot;There were flames from the floor to the ceiling. I could hear windows cracking and breaking in the heat. &quot;I felt myself going unconscious. I knew something was happening to my lungs. I could not breathe. I blacked out and fell to the floor ... I woke up and heard this voice saying, &apos;Come on, come on this way&apos;. Then I felt myself being dragged towards an exit. A crowd of people parted in front of me and then I was out in the open air.&quot; Wargacki was taken to the Samitivej hospital with fellow Briton Oliver Smart, 35, who last night was still unable to speak after his ordeal. A hospital spokesman said: &quot;One of his lungs totally collapsed. He has been only able to tell us his name, and that he was with his Thai girlfriend. She is being treated at another hospital.&quot; The other two Britons were named as Steven Hall, from south Wales, and Adam Butler.  Hall, who was treated at the Bumrungrad hospital for third-degree burns to his back and hand, said: &quot;About 12.30 or 12.45 I saw flames billowing out across the ceiling.  &quot;At first I thought it was part of the show, along with everybody else I think, but I noticed the look of terror on the people&apos;s faces on the actual stage and I instantly realised it wasn&apos;t. &quot;I could feel the heat almost straight away, but people weren&apos;t reacting. There was a girl behind the bar who was more concerned with getting the cash register out. &quot;It was pitch black, it was burning my back, I put my hand behind me on my head, and on the way to the hospital the skin was dropping off my hand.&quot;  Hall said there was only one way down from the balcony that ringed the top level of the club and one way up from the toilets in the basement, and that all the windows were barred.  &quot;The flames spread very, very fast. It went straight along the ceiling.&quot;  Thailand&apos;s new prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, yesterday visited victims of the fire at the nearby Camillian hospital. &quot;Why was someone allowed to let off a firework in the club?&quot; he asked. He also visited the burnt-out nightclub in front of which dozens of corpses wrapped in white sheets were laid out yesterday. A Thai forensics expert said it could take a week to identify nearly 30 of the most badly disfigured bodies. Thailand has a history of tragic fires. One of the most deadly was in May 1993 when a blaze caused the Kader toy factory to collapse, killing almost 200 workers and seriously injuring more than 460. Those who tried to flee from the fire found the exit doors on the ground floor locked and jammed shut.", "publicationDate": "2009-01-02T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "UK news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/02/thailand-firework-fire", "title": "British survivors tell of chaos escaping blaze in 'death trap' Bangkok club", "sentences": ["A Briton who survived the new year fire which killed at least 61 people in a Bangkok nightclub yesterday described the building as a &quot;death trap&quot;.", "Speaking from the intensive care unit of a private hospital in Bangkok as he was treated for burns and smoke inhalation, Alex Wargacki, 29, said the club was holding its closing party when the fire broke out."]}, {"article": " Preamble So what do you normally do on a Friday night? A few drinks after work? Dinner with the family? Catch up with the latest release at the cinema? Head home for a CSI:Miami marathon? Setanta reckons you should abandon all your plans and watch football instead but, thanks to the wonder of the internet, you can go ahead and do them anyway! Just keep your finger on the refresh button and half an eye on your laptop or other internet-enabled communications device and you can do anything you want and still keep bang up to date with this extremely exciting FA Cup third round fixture. I should warn you, however, that this might prove quite unpopular if you are in a cinema. If you aren&apos;t doing what you&apos;d like to be doing with your evening because of the scheduling of this all-Premier League thrillathon, I&apos;d be delighted to hear about it. In the meantime, here are your teams:  TeamsTottenham Hotspur: Gomes, Corluka, Bale, Dawson, Woodgate, Bentley, Zokora, O&apos;Hara, Modric, Bent, Pavlyuchenko. Subs: Alnwick, Lennon, Ghaly, Gunter, Campbell, Taarabt, Boateng.Wigan Athletic: Kingson, Boyce, Bramble, Scharner, Kilbane, Valencia, De Ridder, Brown, Palacios, Kapo, Camara. Subs: Pollitt, Taylor, Edman, Cywka, Figueroa, Routledge, Holt. Referee: Alan Wiley (Staffordshire)  -20mins: Between now and kick-off, I will mainly be eating a packet of yoghurt-coated peanuts and raisins. In an ideal world, I would eat all the raisins first, leaving me to enjoy the peanuts without fear of being raisined. I will also be entertained that Adel Taarabt, described by Harry Redknapp as &quot;a genius&quot;, &quot;a real talent&quot; and &quot;a match-winner&quot; earlier this week, isn&apos;t playing. Again. He is on the bench, though, which should be fun for him.  -10 mins: I&apos;ve so far eaten two peanuts and one raisin, and I&apos;m starting to get in a bit of a funk. I should probably point out that Wigan&apos;s Chris Kirkland, Emile Heskey and Amr Zaki are all injured, as are Tottenham&apos;s Ledley King, Tom Huddlestone and Jermaine Jenas.  -2 mins: Strangely, I&apos;ve been asked to comment on Chelsea&apos;s chances of winning the Premier League title this season. Well John, the answer is that I don&apos;t see why anyone would care because the Premier League is a non-event contrived to steal football from the nation and privatise it in the hands of the few, an increasingly objectionable conceit against which all right-thinking football fans should be taking to the streets in protest. But for what it&apos;s worth, I&apos;d say that as of this evening there&apos;s a 25% chance of Chelsea winning the league this year. I&apos;m also happy to report that I&apos;ve had a good run of raisins and am feeling much better  Kick-off: Hang on, isn&apos;t that Hossam Ghaly. It is! Didn&apos;t he leave Spurs? Have they just re-signed him? Anyway, he&apos;s on their bench tonight  4 mins: Ian Corfe writes from Helsinki, where it is -12C, wondering whether it&apos;s cold in London and if people are complaining about it. Well Ian, the bloke on the BBC news earlier said it would probably hit freezing before this game ends, and yes, people are complaining about it. The teams are currently exchanging throw-ins midway in the Spurs half  5 mins: Kilbane crosses, Henri Camara gets his head to the ball \u2013 a good chance, to be sure. The ball bounces wide  7 mins: Modric plays a one-two with Pavlyuchenko to outwit the Wigan defence on the edge of the area, but the Croatian&apos;s left-footed shot is mishit and it, too, goes wide  10 mins: Aaron Nesmith-Beck wonders how I would distribute the other 75%, if Chelsea have only a 25% chance of winning the Premier League. I&apos;d say, and I&apos;m doing all of this without having a proper think about things, that Liverpool have a 30% chance, Manchester United a 35% chance, and that there&apos;s a 10% chance that another club will storm through to take it, or that the global recession will provoke some kind of revolution which Premier League footballers won&apos;t survive. Now, can we stop discussing this? Or not, it&apos;s up to you  12 mins: Wigan have made seven changes, but they&apos;re knocking the ball around rather well in midfield. Eventually, however, they have to pass to Camara and he falls over  13 mins: Camara&apos;s bicycle kick hits a defender, Spurs run down the other end and Bent heads weakly at the keeper, but two half-chances in 20 seconds there. What you&apos;re up to tonight update: Gary Naylor is online while he watches the darts (Wade 2 sets to 1 up against Nicholson at the minute, since you ask)  16 mins: De Ridder swings in a corner from the left wing. I&apos;m sure I saw three ball boys sitting on a sofa by the corner flag. Can this be true?  17 mins: Another De Ridder corner from the left, and it&apos;s true! What on earth are they doing there? It doesn&apos;t look like the most comfortable sofa in the world \u2013 it&apos;s got no armrests, for a start, so some might just call it a padded bench \u2013 but it&apos;s not what you expect to see near a corner flag. Am I just naive? Are all top-flight corners equipped with sofas? The first corner was headed away, the second flew past everybody and out of play, by the way  20 mins: Bentley&apos;s free-kick from the right wing hits the one-man wall and goes back to him. The second attempt at a cross is much better and, though no Spurs player gets anywhere near it, Kilbane is quite close to scoring an own goal  23 mins: I&apos;m down to my last four yoghurt-coated objects now. If they&apos;re not all peanuts I&apos;m going to be very angry. Meanwhile, there&apos;s a good, open game of football going on  26 mins: Pavlyuchenko ushers the ball out of play, holding off Titus Bramble. He&apos;s only protecting the ball, but the linesman gives a free-kick against him. &quot;Ridiculous,&quot; blasts Chris Waddle. In other news, Fraizer Campbell is stripping off, so one of the Spurs strikers is presumably injured  27 mins: And it&apos;s Darren Bent, who is replaced by Campbell  29 mins: Bentley&apos;s having quite a decent game on the right \u2013 about time too as he&apos;s been rubbish of late \u2013 and from his cross Campbell almost scores with his first touch, but a defender beats him to it  30 mins: Igor Bratic is even colder than Ian Corfe, being as he is in Calgary, Cannada, where if it wasn&apos;t for the walls, ceiling and central heating that he&apos;s currently benefitting from it would be -22C. It must be great to be in a country where you can wear gloves while playing football without feeling like an idiot  35 mins: The match has descended into a bit of defences-on-top sterility, allowing the commentator to drone on about someone who played for Old Etonians in the 1870s, &quot;if you&apos;re interested&quot;. Not much chance of that, I fear  37 mins: Michael Brown handles the ball in the middle of the pitch. The referee gives a free-kick. Brown says it his his head. It didn&apos;t. It hit his hand. Everyone saw it. It&apos;s not a match-defining incident, but this is cynical lying. Can&apos;t we do something about it? Is it not, perhaps, ungentlemanly conduct to engage in blatant lying? Could Brown not be booked? We&apos;ve got to make an example of these people  42 mins: Sadly, no one has yet emailed to say that they&apos;re using this service to keep tabs on the game from an exciting, not-home-or-the-office location. This implies that Setanta have either succeeded in making everyone change their Friday night plans, or totally failed to make anyone give two hoots about the whole exercise. Now, which could it be? Mike Nicholson certainly hasn&apos;t changed his plans, as he is in bed with a nasty cold. Get well soon, Mike. To cheer you up, Didier Zokora is currently feeling worse than you, having been smacked in a very painful place by Dawson&apos;s forceful clearance  45 mins: O&apos;Hara miskicks a low cross that Pavlyuchenko dummies and goes to Modric. Bentley is unmarked and well placed to his right, but the Croatian spins and hits a first-time, really quite difficult even for a good player shot that the keeper saves easily. Bentley huffs  Half-time: The two minutes&apos; injury time are completed with nothing more dramatic than a De Ridder free-kick that Gomes claims comfortably, and a 30-yard Bentley left-footer that flew wide of the near post. The players troop off to cool down, or warm up, whichever, and I&apos;m off to get a drink. Back soon. They were all peanuts, by the way  Half-time thoughts: They couldn&apos;t sustain the promising start, sadly. Neither side have made a proper, good chance \u2013 a Camara header and a Modric snap-shot is about the sum of it, and in the last half-hour nothing very interesting happened at all. &quot;It&apos;s been pretty flat,&quot; says Les Ferdinand. I agree.  45 mins: The second half is under way, which at least means no more ads for another three quarters of an hour. Every ad break at the moment has three ads publicising the hilarious new comedy Sex Drive. Honestly, I feel like I&apos;ve seen the film twice. And I didn&apos;t like it. At the moment, only your contributions are keeping me from a pretty foul state of annoyance, so thanks in particular to Igor Bratic for making me laugh  47 mins: Philip Clarke says he&apos;s in Maui. And that he&apos;s sipping from a &quot;freshly macheted coconut&quot; while &quot;flexing my toes in the sand&quot;. Basically, I hate him. Unless he&apos;s lying, in which case I don&apos;t like him. Either way, Mr Clarke and I are not friends. Sorry, Phil.  48 mins: Wilson Palacios is booked for a foul on Luka Modric. It was a dire, unimaginative, contractual obligation of a challenge and thus sums up this heading-nowhere-fast match rather aptly  50 mins: Someone, apparently called rchljn, is following the game on Highway 78 in New Jersey and has sent me an email from his Blackberry. This is exciting. That&apos;s what my readers should be doing. Crikey, a penalty!  52 mins: Goal! Tottenham 1 Wigan 0 Campbell is played through, the keeper comes out and the substitute dives over him. I think it&apos;s a dive, pure and simple. The keeper is booked, then goes the wrong way as Pavlyuchenko tucks home the penalty  54 mins: Chris Waddle reckons he saw &quot;slight contact&quot; but that Campbell &quot;went down too easily&quot;. He collapsed quicker than a sloppy souffl\u00e9. Wigan will feel unhappy, and I&apos;m on their side  56 mins: Pavlyuchenko crosses, Campbell&apos;s header and it looks for all the world to be heading at some pace into the far corner but Kingston flings out an arm and diverts the ball wide. Very fine save, that one, and the best moment of the match, for me  60 mins: You people are so much more exciting than me. I&apos;m sitting at a desk in north London. Cindy Down is in Turangi, New Zealand. Mary is on the A43 being driven home from Cornwall by her boyfriend Dave. Hello Dave and Mary! Jason McGovern is in Bangkok. Philippa Booth is in France. Simon Brown has just woken up, so must be either somewhere very foreign or still readjusting after a brilliant New Year&apos;s Eve or narcoleptic. And a mighty fine Woodgate challenge prevents Camara from stuffing up his shot  61 mins: Hello Lou Roper. No, Spurs aren&apos;t playing in yellow, and Huddlestone isn&apos;t even playing. And it&apos;s not daytime. That photo was not taken at this game. Wigan are having a bit of a spell here, but Scharner just headed over  63 mins: News from elsewhere, in case any of you care: Ulrika Jonsson, La Toya Jackson and Coolio entered the Celebrity Big Brother House tonight. They were joined by ex-Sugababe Mutya Buena, former Liberty X singer Michelle Heaton and Mini Me from the Austin Powers films \u2013 Verne Troyer. So there you go  65 mins: Pavlyuchenko is played in by a long, hopeful clearance but doesn&apos;t have time to really decide what to do and tries to lift it over the onrushing keeper and into the net. The over bit he does very well. The ball loops very, very high. The into the net bit he fails at, and it bounces wide.  70 mins: Sorry about the delay, I was sorting out a more useful picture. Anyway, Spurs are pushing now but Pavlyuchenko was denied a good chance to score, or at least create, a goal by Bramble&apos;s challenge  72 mins: Jim Flatt gets a mention, for worrying about football while preparing a presentation on the epidemiology of oral contraceptive use, human papillomavirus infection and cervical cancer. Rather you than me, Jim. Wigan are wobbling a bit at the moment, and only the fact that Jamie O&apos;Hara can&apos;t kick the ball is stopping Spurs from adding to their single goal  74 mins: Figueroa replaces Scharner and De Ridder is replaced by Cywka as Wigan make a double change, within moments of which Pavlyuchenko outpaces a flat-footed Bramble but rolls the ball wide  76 mins: GOAL! Tottenham 2 Wigan 0 Luka Modric is lying on the floor as O&apos;Hara&apos;s shot hits the post, having slipped over, but it hits his head and bounces into the net  77 mins: Wigan aren&apos;t happy because Figueroa was lying injured as the goal was scored, after a collision with Dawson in Tottenham&apos;s penalty area from a Wigan corner. Gomes bowled the ball downfield to Bentley, he carries the ball to the edge of the area and set up O&apos;Hara, and the rest is history  80 mins: I hate to keep banging on about this goal, but Modric&apos;s header really is remarkable. It looks like he started diving for a diving header before O&apos;Hara&apos;s shot had even passed him. There doesn&apos;t seem to be any reason for him to fling himself to the ground at that point, other than the fact that he can see into the future and knows he&apos;ll score if he does it. Does Luka Modric have special powers? Is he, I wonder, Mystic Mod?  82 mins: Matthew Cobb is minded, given my commentary, to conclude that Spurs have scored one cheaty goal and one unsporting one. Matthew, the first was cheaty but for the second I think they were too busy honestly counter-attacking to know that anyone was injured  84 mins: I&apos;ve unfairly not mentioned several recent Wigan corners, from the latest Gomes was forced into a smart low save. Olivier Capo is being replaced by Erik Edman  86 mins: Thanks, by the way, to everyone who has emailed to let me know where they are and what they&apos;re up to. I am astonished that so many of you are either a) in Canada, or b) playing Football Manager. None of you, however, are playing Football Manager in Canada, as far as I can tell  88 mins: GOAL! Tottenham 2 Wigan 1 Three defenders, four attackers in the Spurs penalty area. Not a good situation. The ball bounces around a bit and Henri Camara finds himself in the right place at the right time to score with a low shot from six yards  91 mins: The chance Wigan were dreaming of. Rachubka! Palacios! Camara! The spin! The shot! The ball bobbling slowly and harmlessly back to Gomes!  94 mins: GOAL! Tottenham 3 Wigan 1 Spurs have been hanging on since the Wigan goal, but with Wigan overcommitted in attack they launch an attack and Roman Pavlyuchenko belts the ball past a strangely static keeper from 25 yards. The final whistle goes immediately, and Spurs become the first team to reach this year&apos;s FA Cup&apos;s fourth round. Oh, and Figueroa&apos;s absolutely fine, in case you were wondering  Conclusion: Wigan didn&apos;t really get what they deserved from this. A replay would probably have been fair, but a 3-1 defeat is a little mean for a side that played well despite the absence of most obvious matchwinners. Steve Bruce will be annoyed about the diving that went on in the second half: I don&apos;t think it was blatant enough to provoke huge controversy, but Campbell definitely dived for the penalty that put Spurs ahead, Modric certainly dived for their second (I&apos;ve still got some questions about that as well) and the Wigan keeper didn&apos;t dive for their third. For Spurs, Modric was good, Pavlyuchenko was better than usual, but both teams will be more motivated when they meet next week with three league points at stake.  And with that, I&apos;m off.

Discovering Rio de Janeiro in 2000. It&apos;s a vibrant city with wonderful beaches, great atmosphere and happy people with a zest for life. Like most cities, you have to be streetwise. Fortunately I never encounter any problems - perhaps because they think I&apos;m Jackie Chan! My most memorable meal was ...  In Hong Kong in 1981. One of the best food critics took me to try an old Cantonese chef&apos;s food at the King Bun restaurant. He cooked a braised lamb casserole with shredded lime leaves, chrysanthemum petals and fermented bean curd. It was amazing. My favourite restaurant is ... Yan Toh Heen, one of the world&apos;s best Chinese restaurants, part of Hong Kong&apos;s InterContinental hotel. I&apos;ve been visiting for 20 years and the cooking is refined, skilful and inventive. My favourite country for food is ... Hong Kong or Singapore; nowhere beats them. There is so much choice - around 19,000 restaurants in Hong Kong alone! In Singapore, there isn&apos;t much to do other than eat and they&apos;ve honed their cooking to a fine art.  My worst holiday was ... Marrakech in 1991. I found the food repetitious and local vendors a nightmare.  My favourite city is ... Bangkok. Everyone is so honest: the other day, I dropped some money in the street and this woman rushed up and gave it to me. It was about \u00a310, which is a lot in Thailand. I&apos;m not being derogatory, but it&apos;s like everyone is stoned because they&apos;re never in a hurry. my favourite hotel is ... The Copacabana Palace in Rio. Everybody who&apos;s anybody has stayed there. It dates from the 1920s and although it&apos;s been restored, its heart and soul have been retained. Its Olympic-size swimming pool is magnificent.  My first holiday ... Wasn&apos;t until 1983. I never holidayed as a child because my dad died when I was eight months old and we couldn&apos;t afford it. When I was working in Hong Kong friends suggested visiting Bali. I&apos;d never seen anywhere so exotic.  My idea of paradise is ... Anywhere exotic and relaxing. When I holiday I enjoy lying on a beach in the sun, perhaps catching up on some reading or dozing, rather than rushing around.  I always bring back ... Food. Recently, I visited Milan and brought back a stuffed pig&apos;s foot, while from Istanbul my suitcase was full of spices. The case had to be fumigated for my next trip. My last holiday ...

Bangkok."]}, {"article": "In mid-December, I was standing on a white sandy beach on the Thai island of Koh Samui, getting ready to take a dip in the crystal-clear sea. The deepest blue sky and gently swaying palms provided the exotic backdrop to a perfect day, but not everything was as it should be. The beach was empty. &quot;We had a very slow December,&quot; said Craig Douglas, the general manager of Sala Samui which, located on Samui&apos;s Choeng Mon beach, is the kind of luxury villa resort that Thailand has become famous for and which, at this time of year, would normally be packed. &quot;Occupancy picked up over Christmas and New Year but forward bookings aren&apos;t looking so great. We&apos;re putting together some special offers and should get through OK, but there has definitely been a downturn.&quot; The effect of the 10-day occupation that hit Bangkok&apos;s two main airports from late-November to early-December is now slowly filtering through the entire circulatory system of the Thai tourist industry. For each empty luxury villa, the knock-on is a cleaner laid-off and a farmer who can&apos;t sell his produce. The reality on the ground for the hundreds and thousands of Thais who work in the nation&apos;s huge tourist sector is stark with some analysts, such as Global Travel Industry News, predicting that up to one million Thai tourist industry workers could lose their jobs due to the combined effects of the deep global recession and the airport occupations. Only time will tell if the grimmest predictions come true but the immediate consequences have been serious.  While the airport occupation was in full swing, I was visiting the popular capital of northern Thailand, Chiang Mai, and the direct results of the kingdom&apos;s political upheavals were immediately apparent. Reliant almost entirely on connecting flights from Bangkok, the normally bustling streets were empty, and you could almost sense the fear. &quot;Because of the wider economic downturn, we&apos;ve just had one of the quietest low-seasons on record,&quot; said David Unkovich, an Australian ex-pat who has worked in Chiang Mai&apos;s tourist sector for 25 years. &quot;To follow that with a high-season like this will put a lot of people out of business.&quot; The tuk-tuk drivers I spoke to voiced similar fears: &quot;No tourists come here, many people lose their jobs,&quot; said one; while the Thai concierge at one of Chiang Mai&apos;s top hotels told me that occupancy rates were lower than for a bad day in the quietest part of the year. &quot;Only about 15% of our rooms have guests,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s terrible.&quot; Yet to paint an entirely negative picture would be inaccurate. While the luxury resorts and five-star hotels have been hard hit, the best-managed parts of the independent traveller sector have been robust. Take the popular Mut Mee guesthouse in the atmospheric Mekong River town of Nong Khai in Thailand&apos;s Isaan region, located far from the usual package tour destinations of Bangkok, Samui and Phuket. &quot;We had a slight drop during early December when the airport was closed,&quot; says Mut Mee&apos;s British owner, Julian Wright, &quot;but we are now fully booked again. On the days we have availability, we are filling up easily. Most of our guests - who range from young backpackers through to middle-aged, middle-income independent travellers - are pretty fearless and quite comfortable with changing circumstances.&quot;  And it is clear Thailand&apos;s political instability is far from over. The new government of Thai PM Abhisit Vejjajiva is dogged by uncertainty. A second wave of demonstrations have taken place in Bangkok and while another airport occupation seems unlikely, other factors, such as a 30% devaluation of sterling against the Thai Baht and  a fire at a Bangkok nightclub on New Year&apos;s Eve, which resulted in the deaths of 59 people, including several foreign tourists, are hardly creating a positive image of Thailand with overseas travellers. Over the past few weeks, the usually tourist-choked Sukhumvit and Khao San roads in Bangkok have been appreciably quieter, with some visitors to the Thai capital reporting an almost eerie atmosphere. Thailand&apos;s tourist industry is now slowly shaping its reaction to all of these events. Several of Bangkok&apos;s largest five-star hotels reveal that while almost none have dropped their walk-in prices, UK operators have started launching some offers. &quot;We are beginning to see an influx of fantastic deals from both hoteliers and airlines to Thailand,&quot; says Ben Briggs from Travelmood. &quot;For example, we now have a week&apos;s beach holiday in Pattaya from just \u00a3549 [which represents a deal of seven nights for the price of five].&quot;  Trailfinders says it has lots of deals coming through. For example, you can get seven nights for the price of four at the five-star Sala Phuket Resort and Spa, for \u00a31,169pp, representing a saving of \u00a3500pp. In addition, Trailfinders is offering return flights with Thai Airways from London to Phuket for \u00a3528 (inc taxes) - the same price as direct flights from London to Bangkok, meaning that the internal domestic flights are thrown in free. Kuoni is offering savings of up to \u00a33,000 on a six-night holiday in the Six Senses Destination Spa in Phuket in March - it now comes in at \u00a32,131pp. And you can get three nights free in the Grand Millennium Sukhumvit hotel in Bangkok, in May, in a deal which costs \u00a3632. While UK travel agents and tour operators might be trying to sound upbeat it&apos;s clear that Thailand&apos;s best hotels are being hit. &quot;Business levels have reduced by around 30-40% throughout all major hotels in Phuket,&quot; says Frank Grassmann, general manager of the Evason Phuket &amp; Six Senses Spa. &quot;The demonstrations and airport closure in Bangkok came at a critical time. Many guests redirected their Christmas holidays to other destinations such as Malaysia but reservations are now starting to come in again at a slow but steady pace.&quot;  Bizarrely, given all the troubles of the Thai tourism industry, the Thai immigration service has decided to reduce the number of days of a tourist visa from 30 to 15 for those crossing into Thailand from a neighbouring country \u2013 severely hindering Thailand&apos;s role as a regional hub for long-stay tourists visiting neighbouring countries such as Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. Yet, Thailand, for all the right reasons \u2013 excellent value, stunning locations and friendly people \u2013 is still likely to remain popular with British tourists.

Initial results from yesterday&apos;s polls showed the government of the British-born prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, scooped 20 of the 29 seats being fought. The poll verdict on the government, elected by parliament last month, offered the hope of stability after months of unrest that peaked when demonstrators opposed to the previous prime minister closed down Thailand&apos;s main international airport for eight days. But the results will be a bitter blow for allies of the ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who had hoped to narrow Eton and Oxford-educated Abhisit&apos;s thin parliamentary majority. Abhisit, 44, who plans to implement a \u00a36bn stimulus package to revive Thailand&apos;s flagging economy and boost his popularity with the rural poor, immediately hailed the results as a vote to heal the political divisions. &quot;The results show that the public wants the country to move forward,&quot; he said. &quot;People want to reduce the political rift. It also reflects that they want the government to solve the country&apos;s economic and social problems.&quot; Most of the byelections were triggered when a constitutional court toppled the previous pro-Thaksin government and barred dozens of MPs from office for electoral fraud during the December 2007 general election. Abhisit&apos;s Democrat party, which holds only 161 seats in the 480-seat parliament, cobbled together a parliamentary majority last month when it persuaded members of the previous governing party and some allies to defect. In a piece of fancy political footwork, Abhisit&apos;s coalition was able to muster 235 MPs, giving it a slender majority of 37 that left it vulnerable to pressure from its allies in smaller parties. The victory in Sunday&apos;s polls bolsters its majority. The result will boost the standing of the young and telegenic Abhisit, whose support is rooted in Bangkok&apos;s royalist elite, and may ease concerns that he lacks political experience. &quot;It will be easier [for the coalition] to pass measures to help boost the economy and ward off attempts to bring down the government,&quot; said Sukhum Nuansakul, a political scientist at Bangkok&apos;s Ramkhamhaeng University.

At the Premier League&apos;s headquarters in Gloucester Place, for one, there would have been silent cheers in the boardroom at the prospect of last year&apos;s world player of the year coming to England at the height of his career. At a time when the Premier League&apos;s crucial TV rights deal is out to tender, overseas rights are still to be sold and its current headline sponsorship deal with Barclays is up for renegotiation, anything that ups the glamour-quotient and boosts the perception that this season&apos;s increased competition at the top of the league will not be a one-off would be welcomed. In bars from Bangkok to Boston, the arrival of Kaka or a similar stellar name would refocus attention on the Premier League in a way that the signing of Craig Bellamy never could. And at a time when it is battling for eyeballs with not only other European football leagues but also US sports, the more individual superstars, the better. According to sponsorship experts, it will be the Premier League&apos;s brand that would be the immediate winner of such a deal. &quot;People will reel at the sums involved, but from the Premier League&apos;s point of view, it&apos;s fantastic,&quot; said Nigel Currie, a director at sports marketing agency Brand Rapport, which has Premier League sponsors Barclays among its clients. &quot;The top players are the guys who attract the big money, the sponsorship and the TV rights.&quot; He believed the digital revolution and the aggressive expansion of the Premier League into new markets had created a platform that Manchester City could exploit. &quot;The Premier League has provided the platfom, with global TV exposure and the internet, so that anybody in the world can engage with a club and feel part of it.&quot; It is only three years ago that Manchester City engaged a London advertising agency to position the club as an antidote to the global ambitions of its US-owned rival on the other side of the city, the arrivistes from the Kings Road and the brand building ambitions of Hicks and Gillette at Anfield. Billboards proclaiming &quot;Real City&quot; and &quot;Real Manchester&quot; were meant to play to its strengths as a community club but could now take on a different meaning as, fuelled by the wealth of Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, it throws itself ambitiously into the global race to establish itself among the dozen or so European clubs scrambling for global recognition. Tim Crow, chief executive of Synergy, said that while Chelsea&apos;s model had been much derided by some, it showed that with substantial investment on and off the pitch it was possible to gatecrash the party in a relatively short space of time. The London club is now ranked fourth in the world in terms of annual income, although there will be inevitable question marks over whether that position can be sustained if owner Roman Abramovich continues to reduce his investment or even sells up. Manchester City, meanwhile, didn&apos;t even make the top 20 last season, ranked below the likes of Werder Bremen and Schalke 04. &quot;In my opinion, within 18 months or two years the big four will have become a big five. The evidence is there: look at Chelsea. As far as the Premier League is concerned it&apos;s incredibly good news,&quot; said Crow. The comparison isn&apos;t exact - Chelsea were already a top four club and had a London address to trade on when Abramovich came into view, while City could point to a larger traditional fanbase and more room to grow - but provides an instructive parallel. Yet while Chelsea&apos;s growth curve has proved it is possible to develop a global fanbase in just five years, the flip side is that those fans could disappear as quickly as they arrived if a more glamourous, more successful rival emerges. And just as those companies who can afford to invest in a downturn tend to be better placed to come out of it in a strong position, so Crow suggests that City&apos;s suddenly swollen bank balance could be a disproportionately effective weapon during a downturn. &quot;At a time when others are pulling back, if you pay top whack to attact the best - you&apos;re going to get them.&quot; But, as Crow also points out, the best players in the world and all the branding consultants in Soho won&apos;t help you if nothing goes right on the pitch, as Sheikh Mansour and his management team are already finding. &quot;Of course, it&apos;s not just about the money, it&apos;s about what happens on the field. But I&apos;ve no doubt they&apos;ll get it right.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-01-14T15:48:07Z", "tags": ["Manchester City", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/jan/14/kaka-premier-league-manchester-city", "title": "Football: Owen Gibson on how the Premier League would benefit financially if Kaka joined Manchester City", "sentences": ["In bars from Bangkok to Boston, the arrival of Kaka or a similar stellar name would refocus attention on the Premier League in a way that the signing of Craig Bellamy never could."]}, {"article": "As expected, Andy Murray has been seeded fourth for the men&apos;s singles at the Australian Open. With the seedings following the respective ATP and WTA Tour rankings for men and women, world No1 Rafael Nadal has been named top seed for the first grand slam of the year, which begins in Melbourne on Monday. It is the first time in four years that Roger Federer, the world No2 and second seed, has not been on top of the draw. Serbian world No1 Jelena Jankovic is the top seed in the women&apos;s draw, with American Serena Williams seeded second. Murray, who is trying to become the first British man to win a slam singles title since Fred Perry in 1936, has won all of his eight matches so far in 2009, beating Nadal once and Federer twice. In fact, he has beaten Federer five times in their seven career meetings \u2013 his only defeats coming in their first meeting at Bangkok in 2005 and in the US Open final last year \u2013 and has been installed as joint favourite alongside the Swiss star for the title at Melbourne Park. Defending champion Novak Djokovic is seeded third behind Nadal and Federer, who is seeking a 14th grand slam title. Jankovic, who withdrew from a team exhibition event in Hong Kong last week due to illness, leads three-time champion Serena Williams, Dinara Safina, Elena Dementieva, Ana Ivanovic, Venus Williams, Vera Zvonareva and Svetlana Kuznetsova in the top eight. Defending champion Maria Sharapova&apos;s withdrawal from the tournament because of ongoing shoulder problems has allowed the rest of the field to move up, meaning world No11 Nadia Petrova moves into the top 10. World No20 Katarina Srebotnik, of Slovenia, will miss the tournament because of an Achilles injury and Li Na, of China, has been forced out with a knee injury. That has allowed Thailand&apos;s Tamarine Tanasugarn, the world No35, to make it in as the 32nd seed. The draw takes place in the early hours of Friday morning. Last year&apos;s runner-up Jo-Wilfied Tsonga could miss next week&apos;s tournament after a back injury forced him out of the Sydney International on Thursday. The Frenchman twice needed treatment to his lower back during his quarter-final win over Simone Bolelli yesterday and then pulled out of his semi-final against Jarkko Nieminen today after the problem deteriorated overnight. &quot;I decided this afternoon because the pain, it&apos;s too much, I cannot play,&quot; Tsonga told a news conference. &quot;I saw my physio a lot yesterday. I saw the physio from the ATP. I saw the doctor and they told me it&apos;s difficult to play like that. Tsonga, seeded fifth for the Australian Open next week, has been troubled by back problems in the past and was unsure whether he would be able to take his place in the first grand slam of the year, starting in Melbourne on Monday. I hope it will not affect me for the Australian Open but I don&apos;t know,&quot; he said. &quot;I had a problem with my disc a long time ago and sometimes it happens. &quot;I just have to wait and come back on the court when I feel better. I can&apos;t do anything for the next two days. I will stay maybe in my bed and hope I will be better.&quot; Meanwhile Australian Open organisers have dismissed suggestions from Roger Federer that the first grand slam of the year should be switched from its usual January time slot to February. Federer, president of the ATP Player Council, said he would like to see the Australian Open moved back a few weeks so the top players could enter warm-up events in the Middle East and Australia. Under the current schedule, players often choose between events but Federer, one of a handful of players who played at both regions, said changing the dates of the Australian Open would give all players the chance to play both. &quot;The calendar is always something we do talk about,&quot; Federer told reporters in Melbourne. &quot;I guess to fix the Australian Open problem, having more tournaments beforehand it, is to move it backwards a couple of weeks so you have more of an Australian swing coming, and maybe also the middle eastern tournaments.&quot; A number of top players, including Nadal, Murray, Andy Roddick and Venus Williams played warm-up events overseas instead of the Australian circuit. Australian Open organisers have long faced complaints from players about the timing of their summer circuit but Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley said there was nothing wrong with the lead-up events. &quot;This year Australia has showed the strength of their lead-in events,&quot; he said. &quot;From an operational point of view, our gates opened earlier by a week sometimes up to two weeks for transportation and accreditation than it has in the past so the interest in coming down to Australia has picked up and is more significant. There are events that are around the world as there are before and after the Australian Open, particularly in the Middle East but we don&apos;t see them as any threat at all to our lead-in series.&quot; The timing of the Australian Open has always been a sensitive issue. Local organisers like to run it in January during school holidays to attract bigger crowds, whereas players have long demanded that the first grand slam of the year be moved back to March when the weather is cooler. Tennis Australia officials did agree to push the 2007 tournament back one week but later scrapped the plan and reverted to the original dates.", "publicationDate": "2009-01-15T08:32:00Z", "tags": ["Australian Open 2009", "Australian Open", "Andy Murray", "Rafael Nadal", "Roger Federer", "Tennis", "Sport", "Australia sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jan/15/australianopen-andymurray", "title": "Tennis: Andy Murray seeded fourth for Australian Open assault", "sentences": ["In fact, he has beaten Federer five times in their seven career meetings \u2013 his only defeats coming in their first meeting at Bangkok in 2005 and in the US Open final last year \u2013 and has been installed as joint favourite alongside the Swiss star for the title at Melbourne Park."]}, {"article": "Running a country beseiged by protests, riots and general unrest requires a multitude of skills \u2013 but we&apos;re not sure listening to indie rock counts as one of them.

David Hare: Well, you can devote a season in 20 years&apos; time to Paul Abbott, whose work is as great as anything that&apos;s been written for television. State of Play and the first series of Shameless were the best writing in any medium that year. So great writing goes on, but largely in genre. Everything is labelled. Say, six lame plays about comics: Tony Hancock, Kenneth Williams. Or you take a known person and say, &quot;Lord Longford was interesting - we&apos;ll do a play about him. Mary Whitehouse was interesting - we&apos;ll do one about her.&quot; The thinking is: &quot;They&apos;ll be interested in this - they know about it already.&quot;  It&apos;s a very depressing approach to drama because the imagination has no currency. Whereas with Wednesday Plays and Plays for Today, the audience set off without the slightest idea of what they were going to see. Also, remember, everyone wanted to work in television because you were joining a tradition - plays by people like Neville Smith and Nell Dunn and Tom Clarke, who all wrote brilliant plays. At BBC Pebble Mill in Birmingham, in the canteen you&apos;d have lunch with Alan Bleasdale, Willy Russell and Mike Leigh, and you could talk about work. That culture has vanished. MB: I was struck the other day by something Michael Grade, chief executive of ITV, said. Drama is losing out to reality TV because scripted stories fail to offer the &quot;emotional drain&quot; provided by factual entertainment.  DH: Look, 25 years ago Bill Cotton said: &quot;I can&apos;t be bothered to watch a play - there&apos;s more drama in a first division football match.&quot; He obviously hasn&apos;t watched any first division football recently. MB: I take Grade to mean something even worse: that a fiction cannot have the emotional impact of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?  DH: Television has always been run by journalists. Journalists distrust the central claim of fiction: that by lying you get to the truth. The BBC is being incredibly stupid in pitching its claim for its own survival on news-gathering. All their propaganda is about, &quot;We&apos;re the greatest news-gathering organisation in the world.&quot; Frankly, the commercial sector can do news just as well. What we&apos;re talking about is an organisation that&apos;s lost its nerve. When Jonathan Ross offended the newspapers, Mark Thompson went traipsing round the studios and you just thought, &quot;This man can&apos;t speak. He can&apos;t articulate.&quot; And usually the reason you can&apos;t articulate is because you don&apos;t have an idea to articulate.  This is a period of brilliant arts impresarios. When you listen to Neil MacGregor talking about the British Museum, or Nick Hytner about the National Theatre, or Nick Serota about the Tates, you know what it is they want. But when Mark Thompson is asked, &quot;What is the future of the BBC?&quot;, he replies, &quot;Continuing to do everything that we&apos;re doing at the moment.&quot; That&apos;s not a vision. MB: One of the themes running through the BFI season - in Licking Hitler, in Brassneck, in Heading Home, even in The Absence of War - is a fascination with the second world war. Why does this period preoccupy you?  DH: Film more than theatre comes out of your subconscious. Nearly all good film has a subconscious power. The most significant event in my life had happened before I was born. And it was some Freudian adventure trying to understand and piece together that event. And in that adventure, the existing British cinema was no use to me whatsoever. Even as a boy, I knew The Dam Busters and Cockleshell Heroes smelled fishy.  MB: But you go on from that, don&apos;t you, to what happened in the immediate aftermath? A lot of your work, not least Plenty, is about the betrayal of that postwar idealism. DH: Well, there&apos;s this generation that returned from war radicalised. They went to war, they met the officer class, and they came back determined that the country should be changed. I mean, 72 million people died in the second world war; 78% of European Jews were murdered. So people came back feeling that this price must have been paid for a purpose. Yes, I do feel that suffering on that scale is owed some debt, I do feel that.  MB: In this season, they&apos;re showing Saigon: Year of the Cat, an extraordinary film that examines the emotional and political chaos during the fall of Saigon. The first thing that staggers me is how the film came to be made, because it is on a huge, dramatic scale. DH: We went out to Bangkok with Stephen Frears, who fell victim to pneumonia and became delusional. He would hold production meetings in which he would talk about the burning sampans scenes. And everybody had to say, &quot;I&apos;m sorry, there don&apos;t seem to be any burning sampans in the script.&quot; When he recovered, we started filming. Then Thames Television had a strike, and we had to complete the film nine months later in Battersea Park, which stands in for downtown Saigon. I watched it the other day, which I haven&apos;t done for 15 years, and it&apos;s just beautifully directed - you could not tell it had been this epic of difficulty. Pauline Kael, the New Yorker critic, said: &quot;There is no such thing as television film. There&apos;s television and there&apos;s film, and anything that&apos;s made for television isn&apos;t film.&quot; Now in Britain, we never accepted that divide. We always said, &quot;On the contrary, the vitality of British film came from television.&quot;  MB: It&apos;s both a deeply political film and a story about disappointed love. Do you consciously try to explore this interdependence between the personal and the political? DH: I dislike what I call bell-jar writing. In other words, I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything called &quot;the human condition&quot;. Who we are is hugely affected by where we live, when we live, what happened before we were born, who we meet, the culture that we grow up in. If you&apos;re a Chinese peasant, you will feel yourself to be significantly different from the people in this audience. I like history to be blowing through the room.  MB: Are there some areas where a work of the imagination cannot match recorded fact?  DH: Visiting Yad Vashem in Jerusalem did make me question exactly what it was I did for a living. The museum commemorates the murders in the camps with black and white photographs which have extraordinary power. And then there are also some godawful sculptures and paintings. You want to say to the artist, &quot;For God&apos;s sake, get out of the way. It&apos;s impertinent for you to interpose yourself between what we want to look at and our reaction to it.&quot; MB: I bring this up partly because of The Reader. Although it&apos;s dealing with the world afterwards, it still is raising ethical issues of the Holocaust. Did you have residual doubts about tackling this subject?  DH: Not in the slightest, but I had a lot of doubts about the manner. When the book was being adapted, the first thing people asked was, &quot;Well, of course, you&apos;re going to have flashbacks, won&apos;t you? It&apos;ll be very filmic if you flash back to the camps.&quot; But that&apos;s not my idea of filmic at all. The film isn&apos;t about the camps. It&apos;s specially original for being about those who were born in the shadow of the crime. MB: Have you been bemused or angered by the reaction to the film in Britain?  DH: Louis Malle was a great friend - I miss him every day - and he told me, &quot;The French will never, ever forgive me for Au Revoir les Enfants and most of all, for Lacombe Lucien.&quot; And I said that in Britain we think of Au Revoir les Enfants and Lacombe Lucien as great masterpieces. And he said, &quot;Not in France, they don&apos;t.&quot; I said, &quot;What is your offence?&quot; And he said, &quot;You must never suggest that ordinary people collaborated. You must never suggest that the people who committed crimes were not monsters but human beings under certain pressures who do not belong to a separate category but are completely normal people.&quot;  Now it turns out that a few broadsheet film critics in Britain do indeed belong to a category of people who would have resisted Hitler when he came to power. So the great shame is, clearly film critics should have been running Austria at the time, because Hitler would have represented no problem to them at all. [The Guardian&apos;s] Peter Bradshaw would have known exactly what to do, and he would not have been remotely fallible to any Nazi who threatened his life. No, he would have died in heroic acts of individual resistance. So it&apos;s a privilege to live among people who enjoy such moral certainty. MB: Would you ever go back to television if the BBC came knocking? DH: Yes, because it&apos;s the great popular medium. And the reason why I can&apos;t participate in that great popular medium now is because I can&apos;t face writing six episodes. It takes me so long to write.  MB: Any questions from the audience? Question: I&apos;ve often been at one of your plays and felt the impotent rage being stirred up in the audience, that feeling that they want to channel it but they&apos;re not sure how. What are your hopes for your audience, what are your feelings about the impotent rage that your plays can generate?  DH: Golly. I don&apos;t have any idea what the audience will take away. For me, the first preview is the most exciting moment in theatre. Because that&apos;s when I learn what the audience feel.  Question: You&apos;ve done quite a few scripts based on books by other people - The Hours, The Reader, Damage. Do these scripts feel as personal to you?  DH: It&apos;s a very interesting question. Film writing is now one-tenth writing, nine-tenths advocacy. I spend more time in meetings defending a script than I do writing it. So yes, I&apos;d rather defend my view on other people&apos;s material, because if I lose, I won&apos;t want to kill myself. Question: When your play Stuff Happens was at the National, you said you had problems getting the play on in the US. What was the final outcome?  DH: It ended with Gordon Davidson, who had run a theatre in Los Angeles for 35 years, daring to do it as his farewell show. He said, &quot;If the whole board protests, it&apos;ll be fine because I&apos;m off.&quot; Eventually the Public Theatre produced it in New York. And then in Central Park. We gave one performance in the open air and it did feel like community theatre at its very best, 2,000 people in the Delacorte Theatre, with thousands more trying to get in. One of those magic nights when being a playwright was a wonderful thing to be. Question: Will it be coming back to the National?  DH: Why don&apos;t you write to Nick Hytner and suggest that?  \u2022 This is an edited extract from the Guardian Interview with David Hare, at the BFI Southbank last week.

Harry Nicolaides&apos; sentence had been halved from six years by the five-judge panel in Bangkok because he apologised and pleaded guilty to the charge, which carries a maximum jail term of 15 years. The 41-year-old looked tense as he stood in orange prison-issue overalls \u2013 shackled at the ankles and handcuffed \u2013 while the judgment that he had insulted King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 81, was read out. Nicolaides, a teacher from Melbourne, who has lived in Thailand for several years, was accused of insulting the king, the crown prince and the monarchy in a self-published 2005 novel, Verisimilitude. The offending passage \u2013 read out in court \u2013 told of scandalous gossip about a fictional prince and the judge said it &quot;suggested abuse of royal power&quot;. The novel has sold just seven copies in Thailand. Earlier a tearful Nicolaides said he had &quot;unqualified respect for the king&quot; and had never intended to insult the man who is the world&apos;s longest-serving monarch. &quot;I would like to apologise,&quot; he said, as guards led him from the court. &quot;This can&apos;t be real. This is an Alice in Wonderland experience. I really believe that I&apos;m going to wake up and it will all be gone.&quot; His case comes amid a rising tide of lese-majesty accusations and prosecutions, apparently spurred by Thailand&apos;s political polarisation as complaints can be filed by anyone against another. Nicolaides still does not know who filed the complaint against him. He was arrested in August as he tried to leave Bangkok&apos;s international airport, oblivious to an arrest warrant issued in March over the book he describes as a commentary on social and political life in Thailand. He was indicted in November and denied bail. He said he endured &quot;unspeakable suffering&quot; during the five months he was in custody awaiting trial. As he left the court, the shaven-headed Nicolaides gave no indication if he would appeal against the sentence or apply for a royal pardon, saying only he wished his &quot;family the best&quot;.

Senior adviser Pete Rouse Rouse, 62, another in Obama&apos;s close coterie of &quot;senior advisers&quot;, was chief of staff in Obama&apos;s senate office. Before that he was a top aide to Democratic senators Tom Daschle of South Dakota and other Democratic politicians. He is one of the small group of advisers who helped Obama through the decision to run for president. He will occupy an office next to Axelrod. 14. White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel. In The West Wing: Leo McGarry Emanuel, 49.a former political aide to Bill Clinton, Illinois congressman and investment banker, takes the job described as &quot;chief javelin catcher&quot; in the White House. He will maintain a gruelling work schedule, tasked with briefing the president, managing the White House staff, and acting as gate keeper to the information and people that reach the Oval Office. He will occupy a large corner office down the hall from the Oval Office. White House counsel Greg Craig, 64, a former aide to Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy, will be the lawyer to the president, advising Obama on legal prerogatives and authority. As a civil and criminal attorney, Craig has had a hand in some of the most important national affairs in recent decades. He represented the father of Elian Gonzalez, the refugee child who was repatriated to Cuba over demands he stay in the US. Director of the White House military office Louis Caldera, 52, will run the White House military office, which handles the day-to-day operations of the White House - keeping its occupants fed and medically sound. In past administrations has been charged with handling the &quot;nuclear football&quot;, the briefcase of nuclear launch codes. Caldera was secretary of the army under Bill Clinton, and is former president of the University of New Mexico.  White House social secretary Desiree Rogers, 49,is a New Orleans native and former insurance executive. She is a long-time Chicago friend to the Obamas. She will be responsible for planning galas and state dinners at which Obama will host heads of state, governors, the world&apos;s cultural elite, and other VIPs. It is a enormous task - in one year alone, the Clinton White House threw 400 events.  Director of scheduling and advice Alyssa Mastromonaco, 32, was responsible for scheduling virtually every minute of Obama&apos;s time during the presidential campaign. Her role in the White House will be even more complex, as organisations like the secret service and speech writing offices will have a say in the president&apos;s day-to-day activities. She will oversee a staff of about 35 that will include a &quot;diarist&quot; to record the president&apos;s moves. Senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, 52, is senior adviser and Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Relations and Public Liaison. A real estate executive, lawyer and former Chicago city hall aide, Jarrett is a close confidante of Obama - he celebrated her birthday in Chicago in the days after the election.

Nicolaides&apos; Verisimilitude had a print run of 50 copies. He sold no more than 10. But something in the book allegedly insulted Thailand&apos;s royal family, and that was enough to have him chained at the ankles, shaven-headed and snivelling, remorseful to the heavens but too late to avoid some time in jail. Fair or not (and many Thais will insist that it is not), Nicolaides&apos; pitiable image is the current face of Thailand&apos;s lese-majesty law: frivolous and disproportionate, some would say ridiculous, maybe even funny, if it weren&apos;t so chilling. Those who find the international interest over Nicolaides unfortunate point out that few people actually spend any significant amount of time in jail because of the defamation law. Indeed, there is speculation that he may receive a pardon. Thailand&apos;s genuinely revered monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, has in the past been quick to reward remorse with mercy. (&quot;Just be careful next time,&quot; the police and politicians tend to tell those who are ultimately released. &quot;And \u2013 this goes for all of you paying attention \u2013 don&apos;t ever do it again.&quot;) The problem with broad and undefined defamation laws, of course, is that notwithstanding the examples made of writers like Nicolaides, nobody actually knows what to avoid in the future. Silence is the only reliable haven. Even though the king declared himself fallible in 2005 (it &quot;pains&quot; him, he said on his birthday, to be portrayed as above criticism) the environment encourages self-censorship. A December issue of the Economist was &quot;voluntarily&quot; withheld by its Thai distributors because it featured articles highlighting the influence of the monarchy in politics. Bangkok bloggers and popular aggregator sites often receive &quot;requests&quot; from government and/or military officials to take down commentary that is deemed disrespectful to the king, and they are quick to oblige.  Meanwhile, lese-majesty cases continue to hang over the BBC&apos;s correspondent in Bangkok, Jonathan Head, for stories that questioned the role or influence of the Thai monarchy in Thailand&apos;s recent coups and political crises. Within a week of being installed as prime minister in December, Abhisit Vejjajiva said that defending the monarchy would be a key aspect of his government. His information and communication minister added that internet censorship would be a priority \u2013 the agency had already blocked 2,300 websites as of mid-January \u2013 and put this agenda specifically in the context of a need to defend the royal family (from YouTube videos, for example). The charge of lese-majesty can be brought against anyone by anybody else. In the past year, police summoned an academic who questioned the royal family&apos;s involvement in Thailand&apos;s recent coups, and a former government official who took part in a media forum with some perspectives on republicanism. But charges have also been brought by fellow citizens against a man who, critical of recent coups, refused to stand in a cinema during the customary playing of the king&apos;s anthem, and then against a labour leader who appeared on a TV news programme to talk about an ongoing strike in a clothing factory. The labour dispute had nothing to do with the man who refused to stand in the theatre. But on TV the union leader happened to wear a shirt that read, &quot;Not standing up is not a crime&quot;, and that was all it took for her union-busting employers to bring Thailand&apos;s most notorious anti-insult law to bear down on the worker. Practically every Thai political camp routinely taunts the others with the charge. In other words, the self-interest that fuels accusations of lese-majesty is plain. And calls to review the law have become more explicit. Speaking to the Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand last week, Abhisit, a product of Eton College and Oxford, made no apologies for his pledge to defend the monarchy and the virtues of lese-majesty. But he also promised to defend free expression. To strike a balance, Abhisit said he had spoken to the national police chief \u2013 who must look into every report of lese-majesty \u2013 and suggested that while the law has a place and purpose in Thailand&apos;s culture and history, with a little discretion the abuses could be curtailed. One of the more prominent Thais facing charges, the academic and activist Giles Ungpakorn, who raised questions about the royal family&apos;s influence over Thai politics, says the government must go further. Ungpakorn is calling for an international campaign to take lese majeste off the statute books. He wants international scrutiny because plainly the arguments against any criminal defamation statute are rightly presumed to stand on universal principles of free expression. But the appeal is also to the international community, because it is hard to imagine reform will be popular within Thailand. Both the frailty of an adored 81-year-old king and the chaos to which Thailand recently descended (flirting, many said, with civil war) make Thais shudder. All the same, Ungpakorn&apos;s point is well made. Lese-majesty must be checked as the over-broad, undefined, and therefore dangerous legislation that it is. Whether or not it can be completely revoked, Abhisit&apos;s assurances of his own light touch will not do. If anything, his directive to the police emphasises how subject the law is to political influence. Lese-majesty in Thailand is a blunt instrument that is too easily picked up and swung \u2013 often, it seems, by everyone except the one man whom it was designed to protect.

In a message to subscribers the Economist explained that its Thai distributor had decided not to circulate the London-based international weekly. This week&apos;s issue published last Friday considers the fate of an Australian novelist, Harry Nicolaides, 41, who was jailed for three years for insulting the Thai monarchy. Last month the magazine published a critical analysis of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 81, and the monarchy&apos;s role in the political tumult that has beset Thailand over the past three years. The Economist&apos;s December issue also discussed the lese-majesty laws that threaten up to 15 years imprisonment and called for an open discussion of the monarchy despite the legislation that stifles debate. Publishers of the magazine decided not to send that issue of the magazine to Thailand out of consideration for its local distributor who would have risked falling foul of the laws. The latest edition discusses the case of Melbourne-born Nicolaides, who pleaded guilty to lese-majesty over a 103-word passage in his self-published novel, Verisimilitude, considered insulting to Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn. Nicolaides&apos; offending 2005 novel sold just seven copies in Thailand before it was belatedly withdrawn from bookshelves, though a copy is still available in Bangkok&apos;s national library. The Australian writer is one of few foreigners convicted of lese-majesty despite an increasingly febrile atmosphere that has seen thousands of websites critical of the monarchy blocked and many Thais prosecuted. Nicolaides is seeking a royal pardon, hoping to match a Swiss man pardoned and deported within a month of his lese-majesty conviction two years ago. This week&apos;s Economist article goes on to examine Thais&apos; changing mood. The piece says that following the prolonged political crisis \u2013 particularly the eight-day closure of the airport by royalist protesters \u2013 many ordinary Thais are more willing to openly discuss the monarchy&apos;s role in public life. The remarks appear to have been too risky or inflammatory for the Economist&apos;s Thai distributors. &quot;This week our distributors in Thailand have decided not to deliver The Economist in light of our coverage relating to the Thai monarchy,&quot; the publishers told subscribers in an apologetic email.

The investigation began after a man walked into the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington DC with the 400-year-old book, claiming to have discovered the volume in Cuba and asking for it to be verified as genuine. Experts suspected the book was stolen and called in the FBI. Scott will face an alternative charge of handling stolen goods.Press Association Disco kebab shop told to turn down the volume A kebab shop with late-night raves has been told to turn the music down.

In the last week or so, Kanye West has whined IN CAPITAL LETTERS on his blog about being misquoted, while Lily Allen has been slagging off Perez Hilton (again) on her MySpace. But the latest, greatest, fastest way to get beef cooking is on Twitter. The micro-blog site&apos;s profile has been gaining in popularity for a while now, with a number of British celebrities signing up to post tweets about their everyday minutiae.

Making hip-hop headlines at the moment, though, are a new Washington DC MC called Wale and BBC 1Xtras DJ Semtex. While interviewing Wale on his show last Saturday, Semtex noticed that the Mark Ronson protege had Twittered, &quot;Am i the only artist who hates doin interviews??&quot; After a brief chat about the Twit, with Wale whinging he was bored of being questioned about Barack Obama, the show ended amiably enough. But it soon kicked off online as Semtex Twittered Wale to say he couldn&apos;t use the interview because the rapper sounded so unenthusiastic. &quot;@WaleDC: I just caught a serious case of &apos;why did I bother,&apos;&quot; scribbled Sem. Within an instant, a flurry of messages flew between the two. &quot;WaleDC@Semtex: for u to try to make me look smug for no reason isn&apos;t fair... its like u WANT to start tension,&quot; grumbled Wale. &quot;@Wale DC: Im just saying, please give a f*ck when the next kid interviews you,&quot; Sem snapped back. Scores of comments soon appeared on Semtex&apos;s blog, many backing the DJ and writing the rapper off as arrogant. In a final Twitter tantrum, Wale signed off from the service, though he&apos;s since resurfaced. &quot;It probably isn&apos;t a good idea for an artist to post tweets like that while they&apos;re being interviewed - but there&apos;s no beef and I will continue to support Wale,&quot; says Sem, who adds that he&apos;s a firm fan of this method of social networking. &quot;The experience is far more intimate,&quot; he points out. &quot;You can follow the instant thoughts of your favourite artist, which is brilliant, as long as they remember that several thousand people are watching 24/7.

It&apos;s the capital of the minority Bai people in the southwestern province of Yunnan. The centre of the walled old town is China-lite, a tourist-friendly strip of hippyish caf\u00e9s, but outside it&apos;s pretty and relaxed, and the countryside around is breathtaking: in the dramatic Cangshan mountain range to the west I came across esoteric temples, guesthouse retreats, hot springs and even a secret monastery of kung fu monks. At the huge Erhai Lake, just to the east, I sat and watched locals fishing with trained cormorants.  As the closest uptight China gets to bohemia, the town has become the haunt of alternative types from the big cities, which makes the bar life intriguing, and I bumped into a few famous writers and bands, down to renew their creative juices.

The tourist police commander heading the inquiry, Col Archayon Kraithong, said that Richards had been charged with procuring sex and placing commercial sex advertising. &quot;He is under interrogation, but has been charged with procurement and commercial sex advertisements, which could land him 10 years in jail and a fine of up to 20,000 baht,&quot; Col Archayon said.

Book an apartment You might have to make your own bed, but at least you can lie in as long as you like. Increasingly, savvy travellers looking to offset the falling value of sterling are increasingly considering a holiday apartment rather than a hotel.  The economic slowdown has also seen a torrent of properties originally bought as investments or second homes flood on to the holiday lettings market. And many of the established websites specialising in holiday apartments have upgraded their offerings in recent months, presenting potential renters with the range of accommodation and level of functionality they&apos;ve come to expect when searching for hotels. In short, there&apos;s never been a better time to rent a holiday apartment. Kate Stinchcombe of holidaylettings.co.uk says it has witnessed almost 50% growth in the amount of properties listed on its website in the past year, with the UK in particular seeing an astonishing 73% increase, resulting in a classic buyer&apos;s market. &quot;Many are finding that they need to lower their prices to attract potential renters,&quot; adds Carol Mendelsohn, editor of slowtrav.com, which advocates living like a local on holiday. Finding a suitable apartment is easy, she says, as several websites are searchable by region and price and, increasingly, the big sites contain reviews written by recent visitors.  Marie and Jamie Dean from Hackney in east London rented an apartment during a trip to Tokyo over Christmas. Through the Japan Stay Club (japanstayclub.com) they found a third-storey apartment in a residential block in Ebisu for \u00a3600pw (including a &quot;hidden&quot; cleaning service charge), a quiet neighbourhood just two subway stops away from glamorous Shibuya Crossing. Staying in an apartment saved them money not only on accommodation, but also on overall living costs.  &quot;We ate out quite a lot,&quot; says Marie, &quot;but enjoyed being able to cook our own meals, too, making the most of trips to local markets and food halls.&quot;  Staying in an apartment also allowed their trip to alternate between &quot;one day exploring and the next day chilling&quot;, a godsend after a 14-hour flight, and gave them more space to relax and get a feel for neighbourhood. They say you do have to think carefully about the area you choose - hotels tend to be near transport connections, nightlife etc, though not all flats will be - but they would definitely do it again. Another tip worth bearing in mind is to use a site with a rental guarantee that will reimburse you should anything go wrong with the booking.  The downside of renting an apartment, particularly for those looking for city breaks, is that some owners still insist on a minimum of one-week rentals.

Ask for a no-frills alternative Tour operators are taking a leaf out of the supermarkets&apos; book by introducing value-brand holidays. Adventure operator Explore (0844 499 0901, explore.co.uk), for example, has launched 13 Back to Basics trips, where &quot;luxuries&quot; have been stripped back to make the holidays more affordable. Its Spirit of the Incas tour for \u00a31,595pp follows almost exactly the same itinerary (Cusco, Lake Titicaca and a train ride to Machu Picchu) as its existing Sacred Land of the Incas tour, which starts from \u00a32,195pp.  The \u00a3600 difference is due to more basic accommodation, use of local transport and because meals and some excursions are not included. In a similar move, Tribes (01728 685 971, tribes.co.uk) is launching a range of value holidays called Down to Earth (down-to-earth-holidays.com, will go live on 16 Feb), such as a week&apos;s Golden Triangle tour in India for \u00a3580pp (exc flights), using homestays instead of hotels.  3. Haggle for a hotel  Hotel rates are notoriously blurry. The rack rate quoted on a website is not necessarily the lowest rate available, so it is always worth contacting a hotel directly to ask what their best price is, and then asking whether that really is their best offer. In other words, you should haggle. We contacted several hotels in New York and each was prepared to offer deals that were significantly lower than the listed internet price. The W Hotel chain was prepared to shave 25% off one price - \u00a3360 down to \u00a3270 for two nights - citing a special offer that wasn&apos;t listed on the net. Even better, the Dylan Hotel (dylanhotel.com) in midtown Manhattan, offered us two nights for \u00a3245, when the listed price was \u00a3467. We found it helps if you are flexible with dates or have the nerve to book the hotel close to your departure.  4. Take a package Only lazy, unadventurous types who can&apos;t be faffed to make their own holidays go for packages, right? Wrong. Conventional wisdom used to dictate that DIY holidays always came in cheaper, but with operators desperate to get bums on seats, there are some startlingly cheap package deals out there - especially if you&apos;re looking to book last-minute. The mercurial &quot;I&apos;ll go anywhere&quot; function on Lastminute .com&apos;s holidays section is currently churning out some crackers; when we looked, there were seven days&apos; B&amp;B in Gambia from \u00a3399pp (departing 20 Feb), five-star all-inclusive Nile tours in Egypt from \u00a3529pp (23 Feb), and half-board Goa beach breaks (6 March) from \u00a3409pp, all including flights. On expedia.co.uk (0871 226 0808), deals include seven nights&apos; B&amp;B in Cape Town for \u00a3625pp at the four-star St George&apos;s Hotel , including Qatar Airways flights with from Heathrow via Doha, departing 23 Feb. 5. Join the club A number of websites collate the cream of the crop, and then fix deals with the hotels to ensure the best prices. I-escape.com, for example, is a collection of guest houses and boutique hotels around the world with honest reviews that lay out pros and cons. It&apos;s worth keeping an eye on its special-offer section. At the moment the Hotel Salvia in Soller, Mallorca, is on sale for \u20ac125 per night, a 50% reduction (valid 1 March - 15 May). Designhotels.com has 176 properties on its books and promises to match the price of a hotel  if you find it cheaper elsewhere within 24 hours. You don&apos;t have to join, but membership is free and entitles you to discounts. The hotels on mrandmrs smith.com tend to be pricey, but basic membership, at \u00a315 a year, means you hear about timely offers. Currently it has a two-nights&apos; B&amp;B-for-the-price-of-one offer at Seaham Hall, County Durham, for \u00a3360pp. Travel Offers (travel-offers.co.uk) charges \u00a344.95 to sign up, but members pay only for dinner and breakfast (ie the room is thrown in free) at more than 350 good UK hotels. Other sites worth bookmarking are: travelintelligence.com, a site founded by travel writers, among them AA Gill, and the American-based tablethotels.com. 6. Swap your home  Since the economy started to pinch, home-exchange sites have been doing a roaring trade. This is where holidaymakers swap homes (and often cars, sometimes even friends) with people in their destination-of-choice for a fixed period. Obviously, this saves heaps on accommodation. For example, if you live in Liverpool and want to go to New York for a week in April, you look for New Yorkers who want to visit Liverpool around that time, and get chatting. With the recent peak in membership, there are lots of new locations popping up day by day.  \u2022 homelink.org.uk. 7. Camp in the sun Camping is a great budget option as long as the sun shines. For guaranteed dry weather, you have to go further afield. A new website, goglamping.net from the same stable as holidaypad.net, is a great place to start. It features luxury sites cherrypicked from across the globe, including a desert campsite run by a nomadic family near Ouarzazate in Morocco (\u20ac28pp pn half board), pavilion tents with en-suite bathrooms and four-poster beds by the beach in Goa (\u00a3252 per tent per week, sleeps up to 6), and eco tents in the Australian outback (from A$87/\u00a341 pp pn).  8. Go all-inclusive It&apos;s 11am, it must be water polo ... Believe it or not, it is possible to stay in an all-inclusive that doesn&apos;t involve being frog-marched to the pool for fun games, all-you-can-eat buffets and the feeling that you&apos;re actually imprisoned on holiday. Upmarket operator Carrier (0161-491 7650, carrier.co.uk) has seven nights at the Sani Beach Club in Halkidiki, for \u00a3875pp including all meals at any of the Sani Resort&apos;s restaurants, unlimited premium-brand drinks, British Airways flights from Gatwick and transfers. Captivating Cuba (08444 129917, captivatingcuba.com) is offering seven nights at the five-star adult-only Hotel Melia Las Americas in Varadero for \u00a3875pp (saving \u00a3175pp) with Virgin flights from Gatwick, transfers and Visa (valid for departures 3 May-28 June).  9. Live it up in Vegas  There aren&apos;t many things falling as fast as sterling, but according to hotels.com, accommodation prices in Sin City has dropped by 20% in a year as Americans tighten their belts. The three-star Stratosphere Tower on The Strip has dropped to an average of \u00a330 a night (hotels.com), Virgin (virginholidays.co.uk) has four nights inc flights for \u00a3515pp at the 3.5 star Excalibur Hotel and Casino before 28 Feb (online only), while Best at Las Vegas (bestatlasvegasholidays.co.uk) has five nights for the price of four until autumn. Three-star Circus Circus is currently \u00a3425 inc flights before 31 March, so you will arrive with a healthy wallet, even if you don&apos;t leave with one.  10. Become a courier Courier flights - where you get a reduced price ticket in return for assisting in the delivery of a package to a destination - are not as common as they once were, but nor have they disappeared altogether. British Airways currently offers courier tickets on flights to Tokyo and Bangkok (the latter is only available until this spring). Travel writer Gemma Exley has booked a trip to Japan for April - peak season - for \u00a3320, when the normal online fare for the same flight was \u00a3910. &quot;As there&apos;s only one courier flight to each destination per day (only Tues to Sun for Bangkok), my friend is flying out on another ticket 24 hours later,&quot; she says. &quot;But since no responsibilities are required on the return leg, we can travel back together.&quot; As for those responsibilities, you don&apos;t come into contact with the package, but on arrival, you are required to collect a loading note which you must then hand to customs officials. Availability was plentiful at the time of writing - even for flights this month. \u2022 For more information call British Airways World Cargo on 0870 320 0301", "publicationDate": "2009-02-07T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Budget travel", "Self-catering", "Travel", "United States holidays", "United Kingdom holidays", "New York holidays", "Paris holidays", "London holidays", "Rome holidays", "Miami holidays", "Venice holidays", "Stockholm holidays", "Rio de Janeiro holidays", "Budapest holidays"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/feb/07/budget-travel-guide-credit-crunch", "title": "10 money-saving travel tips", "sentences": ["British Airways currently offers courier tickets on flights to Tokyo and Bangkok (the latter is only available until this spring).", "&quot;As there&apos;s only one courier flight to each destination per day (only Tues to Sun for Bangkok), my friend is flying out on another ticket 24 hours later,&quot; she says."]}, {"article": "Whenever anyone asks me why I still travel on a shoestring at the ripe old age of 38, I usually tell them about the time I learned how to play the bagpipes in Havana. Granted, I could probably relate a more typical story about the joys of budget travel - some tidy parable of money saved and experiences gained - but when I mention learning the bagpipes in Cuba it sounds like I&apos;m going to tell a joke, and people like jokes. The thing is, there&apos;s no punch line. My encounter with Cuban bagpipers wasn&apos;t memorable for its mere quirkiness - it was memorable because it illustrates how travelling on the cheap can offer you windows into a culture that go beyond the caricatured stereotype of what a place is supposed to be like. The travel caricature of Havana, of course, is an elegantly aged vision of cigars and classic cars, son and salsa, communist slogans and caf\u00e9 con leche. To actualise this vision, many upscale tourists head for the $120-a-night Hotel Nacional, a classic, mafia-era facility that features $8 mojitos and a lovely terrace looking out over the Malec\u00f3n and the Straits of Florida. Unfortunately, most Cubans don&apos;t have access to the Hotel Nacional, and - as is the case with luxury hotels in many parts of the world - it tends to create a travel experience based more on the idea of how the city should be than how the city is. I spent my nights in Cuba just up the street from the Hotel Nacional, shelling out just $15 a night to sleep at a casa particulare homestay in Havana&apos;s leafy Vedado district. I couldn&apos;t see the Malec\u00f3n from my bedroom, nor could I order room-service rum cocktails, but I did get to take part in the day-to-day home routine of my Cuban hosts. In the mornings I would have coffee with them and practise my Spanish; in the evenings we&apos;d watch the state-run TV station, trying to spot bits of real news through the haze of official propaganda. My host family cheerfully introduced me to various friends and neighbours, and within a few days my little social network had offered me access to underground poetry readings, pickup baseball games, and - on one fateful afternoon - a bagpipe performance at the Asturian Federation in central Havana. Where I come from in the United States, bagpipes are the pastime of earnest, middle-aged men with potbellies and Scottish surnames. In Havana, I discovered that bagpipes are the passion of wicked-smart twentysomething Havana University graduates with a love of music as deep and soulful as anyone portrayed in The Buena Vista Social Club. Instead of playing the Spanish guitar and African percussion that distinguish son music, however, these guys were channelling the Celtic rhythms of Spain&apos;s Asturias region, which sent tens of thousands of immigrants to Cuba in the late 19th century. When I befriended those hipster kids and began to learn how to play the gaita (an Asturian bagpipe with a single drone pipe), I discovered a side of Havana that was as authentically (if not stereotypically) a part of Cuba as baseball and rumba. Like the tourists in the Hotel Nacional, I still had plenty of access to son, cigars and salsa - but I also got to see a side of Havana that revealed the complexity of the city and its subcultures.  I&apos;m not saying that you have to hang out with bagpipers if you really want to experience Havana; I&apos;m just noting how spending less money has a way of paying off in original and memorable experiences. And shoestring travel is not just for long trips. Last summer, I travelled to the Czech Republic with my parents. We could have easily splurged on expensive hotels and guided tours during our time in Prague, but instead we bought a three-day tram-pass and checked into a hostel in the city&apos;s suburban Vinohrady district. Even though my parents are in their 60s, the youthful backpackers staying at the hostel treated them as one of their own, and offered travel advice on topics ranging from tourist destinations to experimental theatre to where one can sample the city&apos;s best absinthe. We ended up spending three days exploring various corners of the city on foot and by public transport. We stumbled across standard sights like Stare Mesto and the Charles bridge, of course, but we also happened upon children&apos;s school-jazz performances and a Czech Corvette-club rally. We admired the art nouveau styling of the Mayor&apos;s Hall, but we also marvelled at the casual art nouveau detailing in suburban post offices and pizza parlours. When we stopped into a random pub and used improvised hand signals to order Plzensky Prazdroj and knedliky, we felt as if we were the very first outsiders to discover the joys of Czech beer and dumplings. If it sounds to you like I&apos;m an ageing backpacker who never quite grew out of his shoestring ways, you&apos;d be exactly right. In many ways, my travel sensibilities have grown out of a journey I took 10 years ago, when I quit my job as an English teacher and took a journey across Asia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East. I probably had enough money saved up to invest in a three-month trip. As it turned out, I learned ways to stretch my travel budget into a life-enriching 30-month sojourn - and in all those months of travel, my day-to-day costs were significantly cheaper than day-to-day life would have cost me back in the United States. The secret to my extraordinary thrift was neither secret nor extraordinary: like many generations of backpackers and shoestring travellers before me, I was able to make my modest savings last by slowing down and forgoing a few comforts as I travelled. Instead of luxury hotels, I slept in clean, basic hotels, hostels and guesthouses. Instead of dining at fancy restaurants, I ate food from street vendors and local cafeterias. Occasionally, I travelled on foot, slept out under the stars, and dined for free at the stubborn insistence of local hosts. In what eventually amounted to over two years of travel, my lodging averaged out to just under $5 a night, my meals cost well under $1 a plate, and my total expenses rarely exceeded $1,000 a month. Instead of investing my travel budget in luxuries and amenities, I invested it in more travel time - and it never failed to pay off in amazing experiences. Perhaps my favourite budget destination in the world is Bangkok. The city may be chaotic, traffic-snarled and incomprehensible, but it never fails to amaze me. Over the years I&apos;ve found lodging in countless corners of the city - from the $4 backpacker dives of Khao San Road (which has gentrified a lot since my first visit in 1999) to the posh, five-star environs of the storied Mandarin Oriental Hotel. My favourite place to crash is the Atlanta Hotel, a curious little $15-a-night gem (complete with a courtyard swimming pool and an art-deco lobby) off on Sukhumvit Road. To the untrained eye, Sukhumvit Road could pass for a westernised strip of air-conditioned shopping malls and office buildings, but the area wears its globalisation in a distinctively Thai way. Sure, there are McDonalds and Starbuck franchises for those who choose to dine there, but there are also street vendors serving paad thai, fresh pineapple and grilled scorpion on a stick for pennies a serving.  It&apos;s been almost eight years now since I finished that extended stint of vagabonding, but the experience is still very much a part of me. In financial terms, I have the resources to sleep in five-star hotels and eat in expensive international restaurants, but I&apos;ve found I rarely choose such luxurious options. Given a choice between a $400-a-night hotel and an $18-a-night flophouse in Hong Kong, I tend to opt for the latter. Faced with the prospect of an all-inclusive dinner buffet in a Santo Domingo casino, I invariably find myself wandering outside to sample food from street vendors. Ultimately, the charm of budget travel has always been less about saving money than making the most of my time on the road. Travelling cheaply has forced me to be engaged and creative, rather than to throw money at my holidays and hope for the best. Freed from a rigid, expense-laden itinerary, I&apos;m more likely to be spontaneous, embrace serendipity and enjoy each moment of my journey. This notion of spending less and experiencing more holds true regardless of economic conditions, but in a time of global recession it makes even more urgent sense - not just for holidays, but for life in general. \u2022 Rolf Potts is author of Vagabonding, published by Random House, and Marco Polo Didn&apos;t Go There published by Travelers&apos; Tales", "publicationDate": "2009-02-07T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Budget travel", "Travel", "Cuba holidays", "Czech Republic holidays", "Bangkok holidays"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/feb/07/rolf-potts-budget-travel-guide", "title": "Rolf Potts on how to travel the world on a budget", "sentences": ["Perhaps my favourite budget destination in the world is Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Railway communications officer John Till and his wife Ann paid for business class flights back from Atlanta by recycling rubbish through a scheme run by Tesco &quot;My lightbulb moment came when I was filling the car with petrol and noticed that the recycling machine at our local Tesco was offering Clubcard points. When I got home I did some calculations and realised that if we recycled enough bottles and cans we would be able to fly back for free from our honeymoon on the Queen Mary. When I suggested it to Ann, she wanted to do it too. If anything, she was keener than I was - she&apos;s the more frugal one of us.  &quot;We collected rubbish from around Petersfield over a three-month period almost every evening, depending on the weather. I&apos;m not sure that I would have done it for any holiday but this was for our honeymoon and that was a big motivation.  &quot;The process was quite simple: we got loyalty points for recycling in the form of vouchers, which we converted into British Airways Air Miles, and booked our tickets.  &quot;It was very easy to do and only took a couple of weeks after we&apos;d received the voucher. We were lucky as just after we finished Tesco became more stringent with the scheme - anyone wanting to do it would have had to recycle more than we did. Still, it was nice to prove that where there&apos;s muck, there&apos;s brass.&quot; Dhala Campbell, a personal assistant, has saved money by going on several recce trips for adventure tour operator Wild Frontiers  &quot;The idea is that you&apos;re trying out a proposed trip to see whether it works as a holiday, so they tend to be much cheaper. You have to be prepared for anything: itineraries can change and timings can be loose while the logistics are being worked out, but you just have to go with the flow, and to be honest I find them more interesting than your average holiday. You&apos;re doing things for the first time and it feels more adventurous.  &quot;I&apos;ve been on several recce trips for Wild Frontiers, including the Chandrabhaga Camel Fair Horse Trek in Rajasthan, which I went on last year. The trip cost me \u00a31,725.

It&apos;s a hotel that also has an art gallery and they&apos;d created a replica hotel room on the ground floor as an installation. The only thing we had to do was to be in the room between 4.30pm and 7.30pm, which suited us fine as that&apos;s usually the time you want to head back to where you&apos;re staying for a rest.  &quot;We spent five days in the lap of luxury at an exclusive hotel for free - I estimate that we saved at least $500 each. Maids came in each morning just like in any normal hotel room. The only difference was that our room was on the ground floor and had two glass walls. For about 15 minutes each day we&apos;d be aware of the people outside the hotel, but we soon forgot about them and just behaved normally. We did have screens to surround the bed at night, though.&quot; Jamil Jivanjee, a freelance theatre producer living in London, travelled as a courier  &quot;I travelled to Tokyo last summer as a courier after reading about the possibility on the Japanese National Tourist Office website. I paid \u00a3310 for my return flight and probably saved about \u00a3600 on the usual fare. It was much like any other form of travelling. I paid for my ticket over the phone, checked in online and chose my seat like any other traveller. Even my luggage allowance was the same as that of any other passenger in economy.  &quot;I wasn&apos;t given anything to carry on the flight but when I arrived in Tokyo I had to meet a representative from a cargo company. However, that only took about five minutes. &quot;The only difference to a normal ticket is that, as a courier, you can&apos;t change the date of your outbound flight, although you can alter the date of the return leg for about \u00a350. Another difference is that if you have to cancel your flight you&apos;ll lose all your money. You have to be at least 18 years old and dress fairly smartly.  &quot;I&apos;d do it again but courier flights are becoming harder to track down.

Giles Ji Ungpakorn, 54, arrived in England at the weekend after being charged under the laws. He had been due to present himself to the police in Bangkok today and could have faced 15 years in jail if found guilty. &quot;I did not believe I would receive a fair trial,&quot; said Ungpakorn, an associate professor of political science at Chulalongkom University and a contributor to the New Statesman and Asian Sentinel.&quot; Ungpakorn, who has an English mother and son, and who studied at Sussex and Durham universities and the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, is the author of A Coup for the Rich, in which he criticises the 2006 military coup.

He claimed that the director of a university bookshop stocking his book had informed the special branch that it &quot;insulted the monarchy&quot;. The offending paragraphs deal with incidents around the coup. &quot;It is clear that the charge is really about preventing any discussion about the relationship between the military junta and the monarchy,&quot; Ungpakorn said. &quot;This is in order to protect the military&apos;s sole claim to legitimacy: that it acted in the interests of the monarchy.&quot; He said a website had been set up so people could inform on anyone alleged to have violated the law. &quot;There is a climate of fear,&quot; he said.

Whatever else one thinks of George Bush, few could deny the contribution he, and particularly his wife Laura, made to raising the profile of the suffering in Burma. In 2005, he spent almost an hour in the Oval Office with a young Shan woman activist from Burma, Charm Tong, and heard about the military regime&apos;s use of rape as a weapon of war. In 2006, a day after former Czech President Vaclav Havel and former Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu published a report calling for Burma to be placed on the UN security council agenda, the US declared its support for the initiative. The US consistently led the way in raising Burma at the security council and seeking a resolution, initially with slow and grudging support from its natural allies. The US has the only meaningful set of sanctions against the regime, and in the past two years it has sought to tighten and target them further.  Laura Bush became a particular champion of Burma, making personal telephone calls to UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon, hosting a roundtable at the UN in New York and holding her own press conference after Cyclone Nargis in which she strongly condemned the military regime&apos;s denial of aid to the victims. Last year, on a visit to Thailand, Mr Bush met Burmese dissidents in the US embassy in Bangkok, and his wife visited a refugee camp along the Thai-Burmese border. For all their faults, the former president and first lady were consistent in highlighting the crisis in Burma and increasing international pressure on the junta. As President Obama and secretary of state Hillary Clinton develop their foreign policy, they face many challenges, not least in the Middle East. Africa will understandably be a priority, given the scale of poverty on the continent and the president&apos;s own personal roots. Relations with Pakistan and China will be of strategic importance, and like Africa, the president will have a particular interest in Indonesia having spent part of his childhood there. But amid this long list of issues, the new administration must not lose sight of the dire situation in Burma. There are five key ways in which the new administration can build on the previous government&apos;s record on Burma. First, keep raising Burma at every opportunity, within the UN and with Burma&apos;s neighbours. Empower the US special envoy appointed in the final days of the Bush administration to accelerate and intensify the international effort for change in Burma. Second, don&apos;t let the increasingly vocal and misplaced criticism of sanctions and international pressure result in a change in the US sanctions, but rather focus sanctions more sharply at their rightful target \u2013 the generals. Third, step up pressure on the UN secretary-general, his special envoy and the security council to spell out meaningful benchmarks for progress, accompanied by a clear indication of the consequences if the regime fails to comply. The first such benchmark should be the release of political prisoners and the beginning of meaningful dialogue. Fourth, consider invoking the UN&apos;s &quot;responsibility to protect&quot; mechanism in regard to Burma. The regime is perpetrating crimes against humanity, including the use of rape as a weapon of war, forced labour, torture, forcible conscription of child soldiers, the use of human minesweepers and the destruction of more than 3,200 villages in eastern Burma alone. Over a million people are internally displaced, and thousands more forced to flee the country. The situation surely meets &quot;responsibility to protect&quot; criteria. Lastly, the US should abandon its previous opposition to the international criminal court and seek a referral of a case against Burma&apos;s generals for crimes against humanity.  Burma&apos;s suffering under military rule has gone on for almost half a century. But in the past two years, the junta has surpassed itself in its level of callousness and brutality. The brutal suppression of Buddhist monks in September 2007, the deliberate restriction and diversion of aid following Cyclone Nargis last year, the sham referendum on a new constitution, the sentencing of dissidents to 65 years or more in jail and the regime&apos;s failure to help Chin people in western Burma facing famine are all examples of its barbaric nature. The junta is gearing up to solidify and legitimise its rule through elections in 2010, but everyone knows what a sham the ballot will be. And yet various UN agencies, non-governmental organisations and academics have been painting an extraordinarily rosy picture of the situation, which has little relation to reality.

Thailand is going a step further: it has invented a new national cocktail, which it hopes will help visitors forget the hangover from the disastrous airport shutdowns late last year. Intended as an answer to Singapore&apos;s slings, Cuba&apos;s mojitos and the many manhattans downed in New York, the Siam sunray is intended to give tourists an instant taste of Thailand&apos;s charms. At the very least the drink&apos;s ingredients are far from bland: a shot of vodka, coconut liqueur, a dash of chilli pepper and sugar, lime juice, a few slivers of lemongrass and ginger, with the whole mixture shaken then strained into a glass with ice and soda water. Thailand&apos;s tourism authority formally rolled out the drink yesterday, grandly styling the concoction &quot;Thailand in a glass: the new punch in Thai tourism.&quot; Perhaps it is a long shot. But with the country&apos;s export-led economy taking a beating in the global slowdown and the vital tourism sector that once drew 14 million visitors to jungles and pristine beaches still suffering, anything is worth a try.  The hope is that the heady brew will ease the pain caused by 300,000 stranded foreign travellers at the start of the peak season when Bangkok&apos;s main international airport was closed by anti-government protesters for eight days.

The working day is much shorter and they tend to finish by 2pm, though their lessons are longer. Also, they don&apos;t move classrooms for different subjects. The whole experience was wonderful and Florence is such a beautiful city. We went to museums and galleries. When my exchange partner came over here we went shopping to Oxford Street and visited places such as Madame Tussaud&apos;s. I feel like I have seen a bit of the world and gained a lot of confidence. It was quite daunting at first, but I think I have made a friendship that will last for ever. Lewis Burt, 14, Litherland high School, Liverpool  My exchange to Bilbao, in Spain&apos;s Basque country, was one of the best things I have ever done. I really enjoy learning Spanish, so this was a great opportunity to improve my language. It was a bit awkward staying with strangers at first, because you worry you might do something wrong or that they won&apos;t like you. But by the time I left I really felt like one of the family and couldn&apos;t wait for my new friend to come to our house. The Spanish kids were a bit surprised that we couldn&apos;t stay out as late in Liverpool as over there, but we tried to plan as many activities as possible for them. The whole experience made me realise just how adaptable I can be. I never thought I could just turn up at a stranger&apos;s house and live there for a couple of weeks. Ryan Jones, 15, Ruskin sports and language college, Crewe, Cheshire I was really amazed how safe it felt in Norway. We went on an exchange to a place called Ski, which is about an hour from Oslo. Everything seemed to be so much more civilised than living here, and it even felt safe walking along the street at night. The family I stayed with were really nice and we got on very well. They really made me feel welcome and I felt liked I just fitted in with the family.  We already knew the people we were staying with because our friends had been over from Norway first. We took them into Crewe and went bowling. They were learning English so they found it useful. I still keep in touch with my friend by email. Maybe I&apos;ll go over and see him sometime.

The way people live there is completely different. Here I can walk to school, but in Bangkok we sometimes had a two-hour car journey because of the traffic. I usually fell asleep in the car. School begins at 8am and finishes at 4pm but students stay behind to study or to do extra-curricular activities, so often we didn&apos;t get home until 10pm or 11 pm.

It offers countless opportunities, over and beyond giving pupils first-hand experience of the foreign language they are learning. But change is coming. From this October, UK parents wishing to host pupils from exchange schools overseas will have to be vetted for their suitability. The move follows recommendations made in the Bichard Inquiry, which was set up following the 2002 murders of Soham schoolgirls Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells by their school caretaker Ian Huntley who, it later emerged, had a history of sexual allegations against him. The inquiry called for a new organisation to be set up to check people working with or those who have prolonged contact with children and vulnerable groups. The Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA), established under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, will be responsible for deciding who can be registered and who should be barred. Currently, about 6 million people - including teachers and other school staff - require Criminal Record Bureau checks before they can take up a job or role where they are in contact with children. From October this year, however, that will rise to 11.3 million school exchange hosts. Despite this, the Home Office says the new regulations would not affect the 90% of UK citizens who have no suspicion or black mark against their names. The hunt for hostsDebbie Richards, co-ordinator of the Bristol-Bordeaux Student Exchange, which has been organising exchanges between schools from the two regions for more than 60 years, predicts schools may have to work harder to find host families. &quot;Schools that use an organisation such as ours may find it easier to ensure every parent is vetted, but those who organise [exchanges] independently will have to work harder to convince parents it is something they should do. &quot;From our point of view, however, we welcome the ISA and the changes because it will be yet another check to ensure that pupils are kept safe,&quot; she says. Many schools have been doing their own checks until now, though whether they have been required to do so is a grey area. At South Dartmoor community college, in Devon, for example, families hosting students from the Satriwithaya girls&apos; school in Bangkok have gone through the school&apos;s own vetting process. Steve Dinnie, the college&apos;s director of sport and health, says: &quot;Our pastoral team plays a key role in identifying any potential problems in families that might make them unsuitable to host a child. Safety is our absolute priority. Host families will become self-selecting when you introduce an official vetting system because those who are sensitive about it won&apos;t put themselves through it. The challenge for us will be to ensure that children coming from such families are not disadvantaged and excluded from activities, and I hope we can find a way around that.&quot; Other schools are concerned that the extra vetting may put parents off. Ursula Morrissey, head of St Michael&apos;s Catholic grammar school for girls, in Finchley, north London, says it creates another hurdle for parents, many of whom are already worried about playing host. &quot;We already have to reassure parents concerned that their house is too small, or that they are not going to make good hosts. I am very worried this hurdle will be just too high for many of them to jump.&quot;  She adds that the UK regulations provided an imbalance in procedures, because few if any, exchange countries had similar arrangements of their own. &quot;If our parents were to ask about the suitability of families abroad, the only assurance we could give them is that they are chosen on the recommendations of the school.&quot; This also worries Bryan Carter, deputy head of Katharine Lady Berkeley school, in Gloucestershire. In one case at his school, a pupil travelling to France had to be removed from the host family after feeling &quot;uncomfortable&quot; around an elderly relative who had come to visit. It later transpired that the woman had killed her husband and had just come out of prison.  &quot;If this had happened in the UK, no check would have uncovered this situation because this was the grandmother who had come to visit, and she was not a permanent resident in the home and therefore not subject to any checks. I believe many of our families will feel quite indignant about the checks and the minor offences that may be revealed that might be embarrassing. It is excessive and we do not need more barriers to exchanges,&quot; says Carter. While Linda Parker, of the Association for Language learning, which represents language teachers, says the organisation is &quot;concerned that some families and schools will choose not to get involved&quot;, there are others who believe the checks will be worthwhile if they provide extra protection. Preventative measuresMargaret Morrissey, of the support group Parents Outloud, says: &quot;We know that Ian Huntley managed to escape detection, and I don&apos;t think any school or local authority could live with the guilt if something happened and there were checks in place that could be carried out but were not implemented.&quot; Chris Keates, general secretary of the teachers&apos; union, NASUWT, which campaigns about safety on school trips, says: &quot;The checks in themselves should not prevent exchanges. If someone is unwilling to participate then a question would inevitably be raised about their suitability. Why would there be a problem with a check if there is nothing to hide? &quot;I believe that the UK government should be arguing for a reciprocal arrangement on vetting across the EU.&quot; According to the Home Office, the government department responsible for the ISA, that may be in hand. &quot;We are making representations across Europe to iron out the variations in procedures in different countries because none are going to be as exhaustive as ours will be. However, even if a misdemeanour is discovered, this need not be a bar to registration. The process will check particularly for offences relating to violence and involving children.&quot; Weblinks Parents Outloud: parentsoutloud.com  Association for Language Learning: all-languages.org.uk  Bristol Bordeaux Student Exchange: bordeauxschoolexchange.co.uk Bichard Inquiry: police.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/operational-policing/bichard-inquiry-report Independent Safeguarding Authority: isa-gov.org.uk", "publicationDate": "2009-02-24T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["February 2009"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/schooltrips/perfect-host", "title": "The perfect host?", "sentences": ["At South Dartmoor community college, in Devon, for example, families hosting students from the Satriwithaya girls&apos; school in Bangkok have gone through the school&apos;s own vetting process."]}, {"article": "Next week, Laos will be connected to the outside world for the first time by rail when a new link opens across the Mekong river to Thailand.  Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn of Thailand will officially open the line on Thursday 5 March, and the first train to carry passengers in and out of Laos will start running on Friday morning, according to the Thai state railway. The people of Laos have been waiting a long time for this moment \u2013 around two years since the US$6m project first broke ground in 2007, and a year after the line was originally due to open.  The first train will leave Nong Khai in Thailand at 9.10am and arrive at its destination, Tha na Lang, at approximately 9.25am. We are talking about a 3.5km stretch of track here \u2013 one that runs over the Mekong, via the Friendship Bridge and connects the existing Thai line to Tha na Lang - its only stop - just outside the Laos capital of Vientiane. At the moment, Tha Na Lang is just a bright, shiny railway station; there is not much in the way of a village or town or anything else here. Undoubtedly, with the advent of the railway age, this will change as Tha Na Lang will become the preferred jump-off point for visitors to Vientiane, roughly 20 miles up the Mekong \u2013 travellers will likely take a tuk-tuk or bus for the short hop into the Laos capital.      A monk waits at Nong Khai station, border with Lao PDR.  Photograph: Luke Hoyland    Nong Khai, on the Thai side of the Friendship Bridge, is a different matter being a well-established travellers&apos; hub with great guesthouses, a handsome Mekong-side promenade and a run of French colonial architecture.  There are also plans to extend the line into Vientiane but, given the difficulties in opening this tiny stretch of track, that could be many years off yet. What is certain is that travellers will for the first time be able to take the train from the Thai capital to the Laos capital \u2013 almost. And the 620km rail journey from Bangkok to Nong Khai is worth making, as it winds its way through Thailand&apos;s largest region, Isaan, a vast plateau filled with antiquities, paddy fields and lush forest parks.  Isaan is also the least-visited part of the country \u2013 without beaches or luxury resorts and considered backward by the Thai establishment (the area was also a bedrock for Communist Party support during the 1970s) - it has never been given the attention it deserves. Yet, with the opening of the new line, Isaan is expected to become an essential stop for visitors travelling to and from Laos. Don&apos;t come to Isaan expecting anything to move very fast \u2013 even the Thai trains that plough their way through this stretch of north-east Thailand have a reputation for moving slowly. Very slowly. By the time I woke up, my train was almost five hours behind schedule. But I was grateful for this tardiness \u2013 without it, the landscape of lakes and light that unfurled through the morning mist would have been lost to the night or the Bangkok smog.  Thankfully, given their late running, Thai sleeper trains have a unique configuration that is well suited to lazy lounging. Buy a ticket for the standard second-class service and you&apos;ll find the beds lined up length-wise along an open carriage. Each berth - the upper ones fold down from the ceiling, the lower ones, which have windows, are two day-seats slotted together - has a privacy curtain and comes complete with sheets, blanket, pillow and an extra layer of mattress. This is a much more pleasant way to travel than on Thailand&apos;s insanely dangerous roads. The trains are also packed with locals following the decision in the middle of 2008 by Thailand&apos;s rail network to offer free third-class travel for Thai nationals on certain routes. Western travellers pay around 103 Thai Baht (just less than \u00a32) for the journey from Bangkok to Nong Khai, and while a third-class seat might be a tough option for an overnight journey (the second-class sleeper, lower berth, is the advised choice at 750 Thai baht), for day-time travel it&apos;s more than adequate. The Nong Khai line provides plenty of distractions if you want to explore at a more leisurely pace - you could base an entire week&apos;s travel on this route if you wanted. From the Bangkok end, your first stop should be the absorbing crumbling temples and antiquities at the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Ayutthaya, Thailand&apos;s ancient capital. Spend a night or two here before getting off at Pak Chong to visit the national park of Khao Yai, another UNESCO site. It&apos;s then a short hop to the earthy Isaan city of Nakhon Ratchisima - Korat for short - where you&apos;ll find lively markets, the nearby Khmer ruins at Phimai and 10th-century city walls.  Khon Kaen, a couple of hours to the north, is worth a visit if you hanker after Vietnamese food while Udon Thani has a night market that serves some of the best food in the entire region and also provides the jump-off point to visit the archaeological wonders at nearby Ban Chiang - the last UNESCO site on this route. The final thing to remember is to throw out the timetable - just be prepared for delays and stunning sunrises.

The wardens knew precisely what had happened. Poachers had trapped a tiger in a baited snare that had encircled one of its front feet with a cable and lifted the animal into the air. Coming upon the snarling tiger, the poachers had shot it, then proceeded to carve out its 22 to 26 pounds of bones, which \u2014 when ground up \u2014 would be sold to middlemen for the Chinese medicinal market. The poachers then cut off the tiger&apos;s penis, which would eventually be soaked in wine and the wine drunk as an aphrodisiac. Middlemen paid the poachers up to $15,000 for the bones and other parts of the tiger, an astronomical sum in a country where per capita income is around $400 a year. In China today, the remains of a tiger may fetch $70,000, with the ground bones highly valued as a cure for rheumatism, according to Arlyne Johnson, co-director of the Wildlife Conservation Society&apos;s Laos Program, which is trying to stem the flow of the illegal wildlife trade. Twenty-five years ago, hundreds of tigers roamed large swaths of relatively untouched jungle in Laos. But in recent years \u2014 particularly in the last decade \u2014 development, deforestation, and a booming traffic in wildlife have reduced Laos&apos;s tiger population to 50 or fewer individuals, according to Johnson and other scientists. The main driver of the rapid depletion of tigers and scores of other species of birds, animals, and reptiles is the growing affluence of neighboring Thailand, Vietnam, and especially China, where a vast new market for wildlife products has arisen. Nothing symbolizes this market more vividly than the so-called &quot;north-south economic corridor,&quot; a recently completed road that now connects once-sleepy Laos \u2014 and its timber and other raw materials \u2014 to China. With its booming economy, China is also the world&apos;s largest \u2014 and fastest-growing \u2014 market for wildlife. Laos is the latest front in the struggle to rein in an underground global trade that every year kills tens of millions of wild birds, mammals, and reptiles to supply multi-billion dollar markets around the world. The U.S. and Europe rank among the largest buyers of elephant ivory and tiger parts and also feed this illicit business with their demand for exotic pets. But as I learned on a trip to Laos earlier this year, it is the Asian market \u2014 particularly in China \u2014 that powers this trade. A major source of demand is traditional Chinese medicine, which is based on the belief that the parts of certain animals have curative properties \u2014 river otter tails for labor pains, bear bile for fever, shark fins for cancer. This trade is taking a heavy toll on wildlife not just in Laos, but around the world \u2014 in Southeast Asia, the Russian Far East, Africa, and even North America. The reasons for the rise of commercial hunting and trapping are not complex \u2014 rapid development and growing affluence that create demand; an increase in international trade; the emergence of increasingly sophisticated smuggling networks; an influx of weapons and technology; and easier access to wilderness areas because of road building by extractive industries. All drive overexploitation of wildlife, but addressing the trade in a manner that is effective but also fair to local people is a huge challenge. Until 1986, Laos was ruled by a communist government and was largely isolated from the outside world. But a change of government and an economic liberalization program began a trickle of investment in the country that has recently become a flood. Like other forest-dependent people, rural Lao long relied on hunting to supplement their rice-dominated diet with protein. But the opening of the economy put a price on the heads of virtually all animals, ranging from river insects to tigers. This, combined with an abundance of weapons from years of war and insurgency, gave hunters the incentive and the tools to convert Laos&apos; rich biodiversity into cash. Now the very resources upon which rural people have long depended are at risk. The situation is particularly grim along the recently completed north-south economic corridor \u2014 an 1,150-mile road that runs from Bangkok, Thailand to Kunming, China, passing through the heart of Laos. The corridor has spurred widespread deforestation and wildlife poaching. Vast tracts of forest along the corridor have been logged for timber and converted for teak or rubber plantations, while hillsides have been burned for sticky rice cultivation. The money comes from Chinese business owners who not only provide finance, but sell snares and traps and place orders for fresh wildlife, guaranteeing a market for hunters and smugglers. The situation deteriorated to such an extent that in 2005 the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) scaled back its project in Nam Ha National Protected Area, the largest nature reserve in the country at the time. Wildlife is commonly sold along the corridor, especially near the Chinese border. But other than dead animals in markets, I saw little evidence of animals and birds along the corridor \u2014 or, for that matter, in most of Laos. In eastern Laos, the Vietnamese are the main financiers of new roads intended to facilitate access to Laos&apos; resources; wildlife comes as a bonus. In Laos, like other countries, there is a strong synergism between road building and the wildlife trade. Loggers supplement their income with hunting and use logging trucks to transport bushmeat to traders and urban markets. Extractive industries like logging and mining also actively encourage human settlement, boosting demand for game as a source of protein. Cash-rich workers can afford to buy weapons, snares, headlamps, and outboard motors to speed wildlife depletion, especially in regions where arms are widely available. A study, soon to be published in the journal Conservation Letters, found pervasiveness of firearms to be a key contributing factor to Laos&apos; precipitous drop in wildlife. For poachers, the tiger is the crown jewel. But tigers in Laos and other countries also face a secondary threat \u2014 depletion of prey populations from unsustainable hunting, making it difficult for tigers to survive in what would otherwise be suitable habitat and pushing them into conflict with humans. Hunters are using livestock to bait tigers; the loss of a cow is a small price to pay for catching a big cat. Sometimes a cow or a pig is slaughtered, dragged into the forest, and wired with snares or explosives so that a tiger lured by an easy meal is quickly converted into a pharmacological product. Pangolins \u2014 scaly anteaters believed to cure blood circulation problems and skin conditions \u2014 are also highly prized. While commercial international trade in pangolins is banned under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), pangolins have been extinguished from much of Laos by poachers. The extent of the pangolin trade in Southeast Asia remains enormous. TRAFFIC, a wildlife trade-monitoring network, recently estimated that at least 100,000 pangolins \u2014 mostly from Malaysia and Indonesia \u2014 are killed each year to meet Chinese demand. More than 25 tons of pangolin parts have been seized in Vietnam in the last year alone, but the enforcement action demonstrated one of the major challenges facing those working to control the trade. Instead of destroying the pangolins, the Vietnamese government auctioned off the contraband, thus allowing the wildlife products to ultimately reach their intended destination. &quot;Selling off the seized pangolins sent out entirely the wrong message,&quot; said Sulma Warne, TRAFFIC&apos;s Greater Mekong program coordinator. Mixed signals from the government are not unusual. Reports from the Environmental Investigation Agency, TRAFFIC, and WildAid have cited complicity of authorities across Southeast Asia in the wildlife trade. Cross-border trade of large volumes of wildlife necessitates collaboration between traffickers and officials. Border agents in Laos and Thailand are known to impose a &quot;tax&quot; on wildlife products, regardless of their origin or legality. Those who run the trade tend to be influential, often with ties to corrupt government officials or the military, and don&apos;t limit themselves to wildlife; investigations have turned up links to other illicit trade, including weapons, drugs, and people. Some charged with carrying out the law act with impunity; forest rangers sometimes cite access to fresh meat as a chief benefit of a field assignment, according to Sarinda Singh, a University of Queensland researcher who conducted an assessment of wildlife trade in Laos. In many parts of Southeast Asia, depletion of rare species has only increased their value, encouraging hunting down to every last individual in some cases. The result: Many areas now suffer from &quot;empty forest syndrome,&quot; where wildlife densities are too low to support people or predators like tigers. Addressing the wildlife trade means attacking on two fronts: supply and demand. Reducing demand for wildlife products in consuming countries is a critical component to this effort. &quot;Wildlife trade won&apos;t end until people stop buying,&quot; said Troy Hansel, who works in wildlife trade monitoring for the WCS in Laos. The supply side is more complex. Trade restrictions eliminate a source of income for the rural poor. So in Laos WCS is taking a multi-pronged approach to dealing with the wildlife trade. In addition to working with the government to clarify laws and strengthen enforcement through training of wildlife authorities and customs agents, WCS has established a comprehensive program in local communities to explain which animals can be legally hunted and emphasize the consequences of wildlife depletion. The program includes registration of firearms, an informant network funded through collection of fines, and a system of forest stations from which rangers launch patrols into protected areas. Still, beyond enforcement and education, WCS&apos;s Johnson and Hansel believe it is critical to prove to the Lao people that wildlife is valuable as a living entity. The conservationists are planning to launch a small ecotourism project to help create a strong link between wildlife protection and well being of locals around Nam Et-Phou Louey. To date, WCS&apos;s efforts seem to be paying off. In parts of Nam Et-Phou Louey where it has conducted its outreach project and has a strong presence, WCS sees changes in wildlife behavior that indicate less hunting pressure, including more birds in villages and wildlife along rivers. A short foray into the park showed hopeful signs. During a single evening boat trip in Nam Et-Phou Louey, I spotted owls, civets, a pair of otters, and an East Asian porcupine. The day before, rangers even came across tiger tracks. &quot;Lots of good habitat remains,&quot; said Johnson. &quot;The recovery of wildlife populations is possible with proper management.&quot; \u2022 This article was shared by our content partner Yale Environment 360, part of the Guardian Environment Network", "publicationDate": "2009-02-27T12:36:11Z", "tags": ["Environment", "Wildlife", "Endangered habitats", "Endangered species"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/27/network-laos-illicit-wildlife-trade", "title": "Rhett Butler on Laos' illicit wildlife trade", "sentences": ["The situation is particularly grim along the recently completed north-south economic corridor \u2014 an 1,150-mile road that runs from Bangkok, Thailand to Kunming, China, passing through the heart of Laos."]}, {"article": "We need to know about your holiday.

Ayre, 45, was appointed primarily by Liverpool&apos;s co-owner Tom Hicks as the club&apos;s new commercial director 18 months ago, and is being touted for the job along with the former chief executive of the FA Brian Barwick. Parry announced last week that he will be leaving his post at Anfield this summer after 12 years in the job. However, despite the rumours surrounding his possible promotion, Ayre remains coy, insisting: &quot;At this stage I am just committed to driving forward the commercial operations of this football club.&quot; Ayre has confirmed that Liverpool have extended their \u00a35m deal with the Bank of America for a further four years, and also revealed the prospect of three other sponsorship deals soon, and a lucrative pre-season tour of the far east for Rafael Ben\u00edtez&apos;s team. BoA is the parent company of the Chester-based credit card firm MBNA who supply credit cards to Liverpool fans, and they announced major redundancies in December for their worldwide operation. Ayre, in an interview with the financial news agency Bloomberg, said: &quot;Other transactions are under discussion.&quot; They could involve the consumer electronics, gaming and automotive sectors. The far east tour will take place from 17 to 26 July, and will involve matches in Hong Kong, Singapore and Bangkok, and given the club&apos;s appeal throughout the world, its fanbase stretching far and wide, the trip should prove to be a money-spinner. &quot;If you are going to build a business overseas a key part is to allow people to touch and feel the product on a regular basis,&quot; said Ayre. &quot;What is clear is that there is an opportunity for Liverpool to do much better than they had in the past.&quot; Ayre appears to be clear in his ambitions to exploit the worldwide market for Liverpool&apos;s gain. According to a Deloitte report released last month, Liverpool are the seventh-richest club in the world, with revenues of over \u00a3200m, rising one place higher from the year before, and Ayre says sponsorship gains procured in the past 12 months mean he &quot;would be shocked if we did not climb further&quot;.

Shackled hand and foot and dressed in prison-issue orange overalls, Bout pressed up against the bars of a holding pen in Bangkok&apos;s criminal court, and shouted to reporters. &quot;If they say I am the biggest arms dealer, so, where is the proof?&quot; he said, describing the accusations against him &quot;lies and rumours&quot;. The hearing, which had been due to take place on the first anniversary of his arrest in a US sting operation was again postponed because Bout&apos;s wife was ill and could not testify. Hearings have been repeatedly delayed by changes of the defence team and the non-appearance of defence witnesses. Visibly irritated by the latest hold-up, the judge postponed proceedings again until Monday. Bout&apos;s lawyer argued that he was being detained illegally and should be released immediately. The judge said the petition would be considered. Earlier Bout, a former Soviet air force officer, described his detention as &quot;a theatre&quot;. Bout was arrested a year ago at a luxury hotel in Bangkok after agents from the US Drug Enforcement Administration posed as rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, Farc, looking to buy millions of dollars in weapons. Speaking in English, French and Russian he railed against US officials and the conditions of his incarceration in Bangkok&apos;s notoriously overcrowded Klong Prem prison. &quot;What about human rights?&quot; he asked. &quot;What about the rule of law?&quot; The US has indicted Bout on charges of conspiring to sell shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles to Farc, which could have been used to kill Americans. But Bout, who was the model for a Russian arms dealer played by Nicholas Cage in the 2005 movie Lord of War, maintains that he is nothing more than a businessman involved in the aviation transport business. In a statement issued ahead of today&apos;s hearing Bout said he was unfairly demonised in the film, and a book called Merchant of Death. &quot;I became nothing but a hostage to the &apos;demonic image&apos; first concocted in a book of a certain unscrupulous scribbler, and then repeated on the silver screen,&quot; the note said. &quot;Moreover, on every new stage of this production, this image became more and more brutal, sinister, and omnipotent, practically evolving into a centre of the &apos;world evil&apos; that &apos;needs to be destroyed&apos;.&quot; Bout, who stands accused of breaking UN arms embargoes to supply arms to some of the world&apos;s worst despots, faces life imprisonment if convicted.", "publicationDate": "2009-03-06T12:37:48Z", "tags": ["Arms trade", "Russia", "Thailand", "Colombia", "World news", "Viktor Bout", "Europe", "Americas", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/06/viktor-bout-arms-trade", "title": "Viktor Bout: Alleged arms smuggler denies selling weapons to Colombian rebels", "sentences": ["An alleged Russian arms smuggler dubbed the &quot;merchant of death&quot; today denied charges that he had plotted to sell weapons to Colombian rebels and denounced the conditions in his Bangkok jail cell as &quot;worse than Guant\u00e1namo&quot;.", "Shackled hand and foot and dressed in prison-issue orange overalls, Bout pressed up against the bars of a holding pen in Bangkok&apos;s criminal court, and shouted to reporters.", "Bout was arrested a year ago at a luxury hotel in Bangkok after agents from the US Drug Enforcement Administration posed as rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, Farc, looking to buy millions of dollars in weapons.", "Speaking in English, French and Russian he railed against US officials and the conditions of his incarceration in Bangkok&apos;s notoriously overcrowded Klong Prem prison."]}, {"article": "A British man holidaying in Thailand claimed he was beaten, handcuffed and jailed after Foreign Office diplomats mistakenly told Phuket immigration officials he was travelling on a false passport. Simon Burrowes, 44, also claimed that officials from the British embassy in Bangkok acknowledged their error only after he had spent 11\u00a0days in a cramped cell with 126 inmates. Burrowes, from Wembley, north London, has been barred from leaving Thailand and is on \u00a32,000 bail after being charged with insulting the immigration officials during the initial altercation over the passport. The 6ft 3ins Thai kick-boxing instructor admits he lost his temper as his flight left without him. But he must wait until the end of next month to appear in court and could face up to two years in jail. The nearest the embassy has come to apologising was a remark by the consular official in Phuket whom, he claims, said: &quot;I can empathise with your self-righteousness. It was a one-in-a-thousand glitch.&quot; Burrowes was ending a three-week working holiday as trainer to British kick-boxing champion, Michael Nagle, when he went to the airport to catch his flight home on a Friday and was arrested. &quot;Thai immigration officials were suspicious of my passport,&quot; said Burrowes. &quot;When they checked with the British embassy, an official told them my passport number didn&apos;t exist. &quot;I spoke to the embassy official. He said it didn&apos;t exist. I begged him to double check. But he refused because the embassy closed at Friday midday. They said they&apos;d prioritise the matter the following week, so I was sent to jail. Officials had all day in London to check. I can&apos;t believe they couldn&apos;t have done it.&quot; Burrowes, whose parents are from Guyana, says he was treated like a drugs&apos; smuggler and taken to jail because he did not have the \u00a32,000 bail the authorities demanded. &quot;From that moment on I was treated as someone less than human,&quot; he said. &quot;I\u00a0was handcuffed to another Thai and sent to court. As I was led into the court I was beaten by an official with a leather strap.&quot; Four days later the British consular official visited him in jail. It was a week later that embassy officials visited again, told him his passport had been verified as genuine seven days earlier. The officials then told him he was being detained on a charge that he was &quot;rude and aggressive&quot; to the Thai immigration controllers, which was the first he knew of it. Burrowes, concedes he used the words &quot;fucking&quot; and &quot;idiot&quot; in front of immigration officials when his flight, for which his ticket was non-refundable, left without him. &quot;They&apos;d kept me waiting an hour studying my passport with a magnifying glass,&quot; he said. &quot;I was angry. I grabbed my passport and walked out of the immigration area, saying, &apos;I&apos;m a British citizen who has come to your country to spend my money. Don&apos;t treat me like a fucking idiot.&quot; Thai immigration police say it was they who were called &quot;fucking idiots&quot;.

The Fiver knows all about the precariousness and tension of the uneasy peace. Take the time when, after a hard day nodding our head at meetings, we decided to interrupt our journey home with a tipple. As we swanned cheerily into our previously unfrequented local, the Proletariat &amp; Duck, whistling Brahms and wearing the Guardian standard issue of uniform top hat, tails and healthy contempt for people whose job requires them to be on their feet all day, an awkwardness hung in the air for at least seven seconds before we announced, &quot;Barman, might you present me with 568 millimetres of your most frolicsome alcoholic beverage perchance&quot;, at which point the barman looked us down and further down and served us the house cocktail, Whirling Haymaker, knocking us off our feet and back out the door. We&apos;re predicting a similar breach of the peace at Old Trafford on Wednesday. Since Internazionale and Manchester United were drawn against each other in Big Cup, Jose Mourinho and Lord Ferg, the world&apos;s two most celebrated managers, have been gently chiding each other in a mildly engaging, mildly amusing manner that reeks both of mutual respect and a barely concealed desperation to put one over on the other. It&apos;s all a bit too nice. But it can&apos;t survive one of them losing, can it? &quot;We are used to Jose.

In 1889 he took &quot;Buffalo Bill&apos;s Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World&quot; to Europe, and his sojourn in Gent, Belgium, made such an impression that the local football club changed its crest to a chilly blue Native American chief and have henceforth been known as De Buffalo&apos;s. Entertainers at the Wild West show, of course, included all manner of gun-slinger, rodeo-king and whiskey-swiller but not, so far as is known, a clown.

And it probably is now, for Mr Vervecken is a referee whose slapstick performance on Saturday did much to help visiting Tubize beat Gent 2-0. The highlight of his sketch came when visiting forward M&apos;baye Leye performed a preposterous triple pike back somersault tuck ... and was rewarded with a spot-kick. The gasps of astonishment from the crowd gave the official cause to wonder whether he&apos;d been duped, but after pausing for reflection he decided not to change his mind, reasoning, allegedly, that it would make infinitely more sense to instead ask the goalkeeper to bail him out. &quot;He pleaded with me to stop the penalty,&quot; revealed tell-tattle Gent keeper Nicolas Ardouin after the match. &quot;After whistling he said &apos;save me, stop the shot!&apos; It&apos;s the first time in my career that I&apos;ve come across such a thing.&quot; Though Vervecken admitted afterwards that he was wrong to blow for a foul, he denied asking Ardouin to come to his rescue. &quot;I simply told him to make amends for his mistake,&quot; simpered Vervecken. &quot;He must have misunderstood me.&quot; Unhappily for Vervecken, Gent suits have donned elaborate head-plumage, smeared their faces with mascara and launched into a war dance. &quot;We&apos;re asked to respect referees but they have to use all the tools at their disposal,&quot; raged one fiery blazer, a tomahawk in both clenched fists. &quot;He didn&apos;t even ask the linesman.

Photograph: C Colley     Approaching from Sihanoukville, the long gold beaches of Koh Ru (Bamboo Island) take the breath away. One of the first islands to capitalise on tourism, you might not be the only one on its two beaches, but you certainly won&apos;t be sharing with many. There&apos;s a small path through the middle of the island so you can hop between the two in only a few minutes should the crowds of 10 or so overwhelm you. If you decide you&apos;d rather not drag yourself away at sundown, there are a few bungalows on both sides of the island, but it&apos;s better to reserve in advance as these can get booked up.  Stay at: BimBamboo Bungalows, pretty turquoise painted bungalows on the beach (double rooms $12 (\u00a38.65) a night) or Coaster bungalows (double rooms $10 a night). Koh Ru Bungalows on the south side have the added bonus of being quieter and it&apos;s the place to be for watching spectacular sunsets (double rooms $10 a night; bookings@barrusihanoukville.com).  Getting there: Ana&apos;s travel agency in Sihanoukville will pick you up from your hotel ($15 for a day of island hopping including Koh Ru) or Coasters boat leaves every morning at 9.30am from Ochheuteal beach in Sihanoukville ($10 return to Koh Ru). Best for diving and snorkelling: Koh Tang      Lazy Beach guesthouse on Koh Rong Saloem    The waters around the uninhabited Koh Tang island are known as the site of the infamous Mayag\u00fcez incident of 1975 in which the Khmer Rouge captured a US ship. They also offer world-class diving, unspoilt by crowds. Five hours from the mainland and best visited as part of a live-aboard trip, divers are rewarded with a stunning diversity of corals and rocky reef dives where you&apos;re likely to see barracudas, octopus and seahorses. Nearby Koh Prins has two wrecks to dive. If you don&apos;t fancy a live-aboard, head to Koh Rong Saloem, much closer to Sihanoukville. Here you&apos;ll dive with kingfish, moray eels and a wide variety of nudibranch. The island is pretty enough to warrant a few nights of post-dive chilling. Stay at: The sumptuous Lazy Beach (doubles rooms $25 a night) on Koh Rong Saloem for total relaxation or Eco Sea Dive has simple bungalows (double rooms $30 a night; +855 12 606646). Getting there: Several tour operators based in Sihanoukville offer overnight trips. Try the friendly Dive Shop which has a stunning new live-aboard boat or the long established Dive Cambodia (Full day trip with two dives costs about US$85 (GBP41 or Euro58). Best for traditional village life: Koh Sdach Koh Sdach (King&apos;s Island) is a bustling fishing community off the coast of Koh Kong on the Thai-Cambodian border. Mostly made up of Khmers and Vietnamese, the village is centred around the rickety wooden dock you have to hop on to from the ferry. You can wander around the ramshackle town made up of huts on stilts or sit and watch the fishermen head out to sea in their long tail boats - and then enjoy their catch at one of the restaurants in the town. There&apos;s also some great snorkelling from the beaches. Stay at: Mean Chey Guesthouse (double rooms $5 a night; +855 011 788 852). Getting there: The Koh Kong to Sihanoukville ferry costs $20 and leaves every morning at 8am, stopping halfway at Koh Sdach (departs Sihanoukville to Koh Kong at 1pm).  Best for beachside bungalows: Koh Tonsay     Koh Tonsay. Photograph: C Colley    Only 20 minutes by boat from Kep, Koh Tonsay (Rabbit Island) was Cambodia&apos;s premier resort in the 1920s, and is now inhabited by only half-a-dozen Khmer families who run the beach-side huts and restaurants. The two palm-fringed beaches both have shallow waters perfect for snorkelling and there&apos;s nothing more demanding to do all day but swing in your hammock with a cold beer. Generator electricity is available only between 6pm and 9pm, but that&apos;s all the better for listening to the night cicadas and gazing at the starry skies. Stay at: Nyan Voyet Mai bungalows (double rooms $5 a night; +855 (0)12 893 102). Guesthouses in Kep also arrange stays at the island, try Botanica Guesthouse (double rooms $10 a night) or the pleasant Kep Lodge (double rooms $30 a night).  Getting there: Boats leave from Koh Tonsay pier in Kep for $10 return. Best for a deserted island experience: Koh Rong If you want to be literally the only person on the beach, then head to Koh Rong. Two-and-a-half hours by boat from Sihanoukville, it&apos;s arguably the most magnificent island off the coast. Dumbbell shaped with a dense jungle interior, Koh Rong is a pristine island rarely visited by other travellers. The beach on the southwest side is known as &quot;Snowdrift Bay&quot; and for good reason, its talcum-soft sand squeaks under foot and goes on for miles. There&apos;s no path to it, however, so get dropped off there or charter a boat from the fishing village where there&apos;s a shop to stock up on supplies.  Stay at: There are no guesthouses on the island, so take a tent, torch and provisions. Getting there: Charter a boat from Sihanoukville ($50-$80 depending on bargaining skills) or hitch a ride with a dive boat ($40).

For this week has been - an exhaustive search of the archives officially reveals - The Best Week of Animal Stories Ever (exclamation mark optional). Ah, animal stories - how we love thee! But why? Well, the shortest answer to this is, of course: &quot;Because we&apos;ve met people.&quot; The longer answer is - excuse me, but what is not to love about the story of Mayflower the pony who has such wee short legs that passersby who see her grazing in the salt marshes of Southampton keep calling the fire brigade because they think she is stuck in the mud? Look at her! A tiny little pony with even tinier little legs! And she has owners, so she&apos;s not going to be subject to brutal Darwinian filtering as she might in the wild. Instead, she grazes contentedly while acting as a conduit for other people&apos;s unselfish, if - happily - misguided concerns for her welfare. There is absolutely nothing bad in this story, just as there isn&apos;t in the tale of Hope the otter, who was found by Camilla Ravenshear near the River Exe and kept alive by her overnight until she could be handed over to experts at the Secret World Wildlife Rescue centre in Somerset. This story scores extra delightfulness points by being immediately transplantable into an interwar children&apos;s novel without even changing the name of the rescuer. Then there&apos;s the news of the two male ducks at the Arundel Wetland Centre who have thwarted the staff&apos;s attempts to get them to breed with a female by turning out to be gay. There is something irrepressibly joyful about the idea of gay ducks. It&apos;s not quite as good as gay penguins, but it&apos;s still pretty splendid. It has a small something to do with knowing that it is one in the eye for evangelical rightwing Christians who like to hold up the natural world as evidence of all that is holy and that human homosexuality is our own, evil choice, but mainly the appeal of their story lies in the general air of insouciant disregard of others&apos; wishes. It speaks to the id in all of us.  What else? How about Mosha, the elephant in Thailand who has been given a new false leg? That&apos;s right, a new one. She grew out of the old one, which was made for her after she stepped on a landmine on the Burmese border, so she&apos;s been upgraded. You could focus on the landmine issue here, of course, but let&apos;s not. Let&apos;s look upon Mosha as a rare symbol of the good we can do - or at least the harm we can undo - if we put our minds to it.           There is, however, a batch of animal stories with slightly more sinister overtones involving chimpanzees and our other hairy cousins. First, there were the reports that a chimp in Sweden&apos;s Furuvik zoo has taken to stockpiling stones overnight in order to throw them at visitors the next day, thus exhibiting the ability to plan for the future that experts had believed to be exclusively human. This news was swiftly followed by that of a monkey in Thailand who, after years of being beaten by his owner into harvesting coconuts, had killed him by throwing one of said coconuts at his head. By the time you add the macaques living in temple ruins outside Bangkok who are teaching their young to brush their teeth and use fallen human hair as dental floss, you can hardly avoid the conclusion that something is most definitely up. The next wave of primate evolution has begun. Perhaps all the warmly endearing animal activities have been deliberately undertaken to distract us all from ape plans for imminent takeover. Well, we&apos;ve had our chance at running the world, I guess, and a right bloody balls-up we&apos;ve made of it too. Good luck to them, I say. I only hope my own stumpy legs charm our new overlords into letting me graze in peace too.", "publicationDate": "2009-03-13T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Animals", "World news", "Animal welfare", "UK news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/13/animals-animalwelfare", "title": "Lucy Mangan: Is this the most important week ever for animal stories?", "sentences": ["By the time you add the macaques living in temple ruins outside Bangkok who are teaching their young to brush their teeth and use fallen human hair as dental floss, you can hardly avoid the conclusion that something is most definitely up."]}, {"article": "Flights Sydney or Auckland from \u00a3499rtn: This is one of a number of long-haul deals from Trailfinders.

But this unique corner of the world is threatened by a government plan to build a hydroelectric dam only a few kilometres upstream \u2014 a plan that has triggered a cascade of protests from environmental organisations and international scientists. If the dam goes ahead it will have a major impact on the Irrawaddy dolphins and another endangered species, the giant catfish. It will also severely reduce the flow to the Khone Falls, Asia&apos;s largest waterfall. Carl Middleton, the Bangkok spokesman of International Rivers, an environmental NGO said: &quot;This stretch of the Mekong is globally renowned for its biodiversity. Building the dam would block the massive fish migrations that help feed millions of people within the region. The stakes are huge. This is one dam that must never be built.&quot; On the Cambodian side of the border the Mekong river is recognised internationally as a conservation site by the UN&apos;s wetland conservation body, Ramsar. There are moves to do the same on the Laos side. In March 2006, the the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic (LPDR) signed an agreement with Mega First Corporation Malaysia, to do a feasibility study to build a 240MW dam across the Mekong&apos;s Hou Sahong channel, bordering Cambodia. A Project Development Agreement was signed in 2008, but as yet no final decision has been made by the LPDR. No construction has started on the dam yet. Tomorrow, International Rivers together with local NGO partners in Thailand and Cambodia will launch a campaign to stop the Don Sahong Dam project as part of a Save the Mekong Campaign. The launch coincides with the International Day of Action for Rivers. The fisheries expert who provided a report on the negative impacts as part of the Don Sahong dam&apos;s environmental impact assessment, who asked not to be named, said: &quot;If this dam goes ahead, it will be an ecological disaster for fish migrations routes between Cambodia and Laos. Over 300 species of fish would be adversely affected&quot;. He claims his objections to the project were not properly taken into account. Another report from the research body, the World Fish Centre, based in Penang, Malaysia, said the project &quot;would block the crucial passageway through the Hou Sahong channel, the only major channel of fish migration between Cambodia and Laos, causing havoc to the normal breeding cycles and put at risk 70% of the fish catch in the Lower Mekong Basin.&quot; The report says that wild capture fisheries in Laos amount to 64,600 tonnes \u2014 78% of the country&apos;s total fish production. Ian Baird, a Canadian fisheries expert, who has spent years researching the Mekong, explained: &quot;this dam does not only impact fishermen living in area of the dam but far beyond the 4000 Islands. Some species swim up from the estuary in Vietnam through Cambodia, all the way up to Luang Prabang in northern Laos. And 60 million people are dependent for their food and their livelihood on fisheries.&quot; The total catch from the river is between 1 and 2m tons a year. In a report for the World Fish Centre in 2007, Eric Baran and Blake Ratner calculated that the direct value to the Laos economy from wild fisheries is between $66m and $100m, contributing 6% to 8% of GDP. Landlocked Laos is one of the least developed countries in the region, and authorities have been eager to harness one of its few natural resources, an abundance of mountains and surging rivers. The World Bank and the ADB-Asian Development Bank have both pushed the Laotian government to embrace hydropower development and to supply power to their energy-hungry neighbours, Thailand and Vietnam. There are already seven hydroelectric dams in Laos and 11 more dam projects are planned. The massive Nam Theun 2 project, with a capacity of 1088MW, now under construction, will supply much of the growing energy needs of the region. Luesak Soumpholphakdy, who owns the Sahaphae Hotel on Don Kong island, said: &quot;after Nam Theun 2 [Dam] we have enough electricity. Why do we need a Don Sahong? I am worried about the fish and the dam.&quot; The LPDR tourism ministry is against the new dam because they believe it will undermine the country&apos;s huge potential for eco-tourism in Champasak province. The project is also in conflict with a joint agreement between Laos and Cambodia to work together on both sides of the Mekong for the protection of water resources, waste management, dolphin conservation and sustainable tourism. \u2022 This article was amended on Sunday 15 March 2009.

Bout is currently languishing in a maximum security prison in Bangkok after being arrested in March last year in a sting operation by American agents. The United States has requested his extradition and final court hearings are expected to take place next week. Bout said that the allegations against him were &quot;lies and bullshit&quot;. He said: &quot;I never supplied arms as such at all and I never especially never had any deal with al-Qaida.&quot; Asked if it was possible that planes owned by him carried weapons without his knowledge, he said: &quot;I could not exclude that.&quot; During four separate interviews with Channel 4 News, he later admitted that his planes did ship arms into Afghanistan in 1996 for the government during the civil war it fought against the Taliban. Bout, who has been nicknamed &quot;the Merchant of Death&quot; and &quot;the embargo buster&quot;, became a notorious figure during the 1990s, when he was accused of illegally smuggling arms to numerous African regimes and conflicts.  The UN has accused him of arming the alleged war criminal Charles Taylor in Liberia, as well as rebels in Sierra Leone and the Congo. He was arrested in a five-star hotel last March while allegedly discussing the sale of shoulder-launched missiles with US agents masquerading as Colombian rebels from FARC. The request to Thai authorities to arrest Bout says the US feared he was travelling on a British passport, number K163077. UK officials have declined to comment. His latest denials were treated with scepticism by those responsible for investigating his activities during the 1990s. Former foreign minister Peter Hain, who originally tagged him &quot;the Merchant of Death&quot;, said: &quot;He was fuelling the war in Sierra Leone, where terrorists with guns were cutting off the limbs of civilians and shooting the people of the country, and they would not have been able to do that if were it not for his arms coming in.&quot; Johan Peleman, who investigated him for the UN, said: &quot;I would not \u2013 like some \u2013 call him the McDonald&apos;s of the arms business. I think he&apos;s more a very talented and cunning businessman.&quot; In the orange shirt and shorts of a Thai prison uniform, Bout cuts a much slimmer figure than before. While happy to admit associating with warlords, he denies all accusations of wrongdoing.  Bout, 42, admitted he had worked for his &quot;very close friend&quot; Jean-Pierre Bemba, a warlord who became the vice-president of the Congo, who is now in the Hague awaiting trial for orchestrating rape, mass murder and child soldiering. Bout said: &quot;I know Bemba very well and I am telling you from any point of view he would never give any orders, especially to rape women in the Central African Republic&quot; \u2013 one of the crimes of which Bemba is accused. Bout&apos;s supposed client list reads like a Who&apos;s Who of the world&apos;s nastiest warlords but also includes Americans, Britons, Frenchmen and Russians. A former US deputy defence secretary, Paul Wolfowitz, has admitted that planes connected to his department did fly supplies into Iraq to aid the US occupation. Bout said it was possible that these deliveries were made by a company run by his brother, Sergei. He denied earlier reports that he shipped armoured cars into Iraq for Britain. He said the French government did hire him to fly its troops into the Congo in 1994 for Operation Turquoise, a relief mission after the Rwanda genocide.  Some analysts suspect that Bout&apos;s activities were linked to Russian intelligence. He denies this, but, asked if he worked for the Russian state, he said: &quot;Sometimes, yeah. We did the flights.&quot; His battle against extradition has now become intensely political. Some observers have speculated that he is of high value to the US because of his alleged links to Igor Sechin, a deputy to Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin and one of the Kremlin&apos;s most powerful figures. He denied any such links or ever meeting Sechin, saying that the two men did not \u2013 as is claimed \u2013 serve as intelligence officers in Mozambique at the same time. The last days of Bout&apos;s court hearings are on Tuesday and Wednesday and a decision is expected within a month. Although one estimate had his wealth at $6 billion, Bout said he was bankrupt. He said: &quot;I have my [principles], I did not do this just for money, otherwise I would be definitely way more richer and would not be in this position [in jail]. I did not move arms for the Taliban, I did not move arms for many other people.&quot; He added: &quot;I would do the same [all over again]. These are the decisions of my heart and my mind.

Perhaps I could, too. At the age of 21, knowing I needed a day job while I got on with writing poetry, I chose to train as a librarian. My decision served romantic as well as practical ends. I saw libraries as magical, enchanted places, palaces of the imagination; I recognised librarians as generous custodians of treasures. The training took two years: a stint of practical experience followed by study at library school. First, I became the Library Student in the department of printed books in the British Museum, having won the relevant scholarship. I began work at the enquiries desk in the domed, circular Reading Room, directing readers to bibliographies, or the subject index, or the catalogue, and answering letters. These flooded in, on every possible subject, and a courteous, helpful reply had to be written, however eccentric the question. In the autumn of 1970, the catalogue existed as heavy, folio-sized volumes arranged on circular shelves in the centre of the Reading Room. Within these fortifications, in a little glass-walled turret, sat the superintendent, a large burly man in a black suit, keeping an eye on everyone and everything.  As a librarian, I had a bunch of keys, and with these I could unlock any door, swing open any section of the bookshelves. I got happily lost in this labyrinth. Sometimes I came across scholars&apos; cubbyholes. George Painter, the biographer of Proust, worked in one of these hidden spaces. Howard Nixon, the Renaissance bindings expert, occupied another. Earlier this week, the British Library revealed it has, over the years, lost track of more than 9,000 books, many of them very valuable. The library&apos;s head of records, Jennifer Perkins, said that the books could have been misplaced, wrongly catalogued, that the labels might have fallen off. How does this happen? In the early 1970s, I met revolutionary librarians who were busy trying to get a richer variety of books on to the shelves, just as their 19th-century forebears had. Perhaps they &quot;lost&quot; some of these books? My second year of training, in 1972, took place at University College London. We had classes in cataloguing, classification theory, bibliography, management studies. We learned that libraries were beginning to communicate with one another by computer. This eventually made it possible to radically change old-fashioned, even reactionary, classification systems. For example, all public libraries in Britain used the Dewey decimal system, which categorised human knowledge as a pyramidal structure. Subjects were arranged one to 10, and under them came sub-divisions, and then sub-divisions of sub-divisions. The system locked subjects into fixed places. Under category seven, Sociology, you could find Women, alongside Lunatics and Gypsies. Men were nowhere to be seen: as designers of the universe, and of classification systems, they did not need to be visible. For my special subject at library school, I chose Women. Using a computer-based theory, I designed a revolutionary new library classification model that put women at the centre of world, as thinking subjects, and let women relate to anything they liked. These idealistic experiments needed to co-exist with reality. I spent a couple of weeks doing work experience in the public library on Holloway Road, but grew bored. I supported the socialist founding principles of public libraries - free knowledge for all - but had not sufficiently understood that it was the people who read the books, not the librarians. We issued and stamped the tickets; they lost themselves in novels. I sulked, spending long hours forced to shelve books according to reactionary old Dewey. I discovered the Fawcett Library, with its vast archive of suffragette history, mostly kept in cardboard boxes in a dusty back room, and discussed with comrades how we might set up a feminist library in Holloway. Now, of course, the great Fawcett collection has moved to the East End, renamed itself the Women&apos;s Library and is open to everyone. I did not survive long as a librarian. After a seven-month stint as the British Council&apos;s librarian in Bangkok (I blotted my copybook by sending the king and queen stern reminders that their library books were overdue), I returned to the UK and supported myself through part-time teaching and journalism. From time to time, I meet some of the librarians with whom I trained: they have had to become expert managers and ideologues in a free market, fighting the narrowing availability of public libraries and their reduction of stock, coaxing disaffected youngsters into Idea Stores, battling the contempt for intellectual life initiated in the Thatcher years.

It is a year since the elusive Russian was arrested in Bangkok, after a sting operation by agents from the American Drug Enforcement Administration. He was nabbed in a luxury hotel where he expected to sign off a lucrative arms deal with men who posed as representatives of a Colombian revolutionary group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc). He reportedly offered to supply them with millions of dollars&apos; worth of weapons and war machinery, ranging from rocket-launchers to helicopters. For years the moustachioed Bout has been a man of silence. He kept quiet as evidence and allegations piled up about his involvement in the sourcing and transport of weapons from eastern Europe to unsavoury characters in the Middle East and Africa. Activist groups such as Global Witness, as well as UN investigators, said he fuelled civil wars by supplying weapons to warlords and despots. He ignored them. He was accused of breaking UN arms embargoes, imposed to restrain hideous conflicts in Liberia and Sierra Leone, for example, but did not reply. Dubbed a &quot;merchant of death&quot; and an &quot;embargo buster&quot; by Peter Hain, then a foreign minister, he shrugged. When Hollywood produced a fictionalised account of his activities, Lord of War, he dismissed the movie as rubbish and said he felt &quot;sorry&quot; for Nicolas Cage, the lead actor. He did change his behaviour: retreating to Russia, evading repeated attempts by western security services who planned to nab him at Athens airport, then in Madrid. But he kept quiet, even after his arrest, and even as allegations spread that he had supplied weapons to the Taliban, to al-Qaida and to Islamic fundamentalists in Somalia. Perhaps he assumed that the less he said in public the greater his chances of getting protection from the Russian government. Now something has changed. This month he undergoes more hearings for extradition from Thailand to America (where he faces prosecution, and potentially life imprisonment, for offering to help terrorists). From behind his bars and dressed in orange prison garb, he has taken to shouting brief interviews to foreign journalists, switching deftly between English, French and Russian. He complains about harsh conditions in the high-security jail. He accuses prosecutors and journalists of generating &quot;theatre&quot;, with himself cast \u2013 so unfairly \u2013 as chief villain. Early in March he lamented that others were concocting a &quot;demonic image&quot; of him. Yesterday Channel 4 news broadcast the most revealing interview yet, in which Bout first denied all the accusations against him, calling them &quot;lie[s] and just bullshit, I never supplied arms as such at all and especially didn&apos;t have any deal with al-Qaida.&quot; But he also made some surprising admissions. After few gentle prods by interviewer Nick Paton Walsh, the Russian conceded that some of his planes might well have been used to fly arms, that weapons were indeed taken to Afghanistan in the 1990s (although he denies selling to the Taliban) and that he has spent time in Liberia and Congo. Had Bout worked for the Russian government? &quot;Sometimes, yeah.&quot; Most oddly, Bout chose to speak up for his &quot;close friend&quot;, the Congolese warlord Jean-Pierre Bemba, who is now on trial in The Hague for war crimes, murder and orchestrating mass rape during Congo&apos;s hellish civil war. The Russian is accused of supplying weapons that helped to keep that war going, and that in turn allowed horrors to be inflicted, mostly on entirely innocent civilians. On this occasion he had the sense, at least, not to mention his association with Charles Taylor, the Liberian former dictator, also now on trial for war crimes by a special court for Sierra Leone. Bout is also accused by activists and others of supplying weapons to Taylor and the militias he supported in Sierra Leone. It is late for Bout to try to polish his image. But he has realised that his growing notoriety might be problematic if he wants to claim to be nothing more than a logistics expert with an interest in exotic places. Thus he has launched a media effort to mirror his legal one. It isn&apos;t easy for such characters to adapt their image when talking to the press. Simon Mann, the Briton caught up in the &quot;Wonga Coup&quot; attempt to overthrow the president of Equatorial Guinea, tried to present himself to the press (and in court) as a jovial fool who meant no harm to anyone and is now terribly sorry. Bout tries to claim he is a mere businessman, whose good name has been besmirched by wicked journalists, activists and prosecutors. It is doubtful that many viewers or readers will be persuaded.", "publicationDate": "2009-03-18T10:30:00Z", "tags": ["Russia", "Arms trade", "Thailand", "War crimes", "World news", "Law", "Viktor Bout", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/17/russia-arms-trade", "title": "Adam Roberts: Russian arms trader is trying to shake off his demonic image", "sentences": ["It is a year since the elusive Russian was arrested in Bangkok, after a sting operation by agents from the American Drug Enforcement Administration."]}, {"article": "Give this hot share the cold shoulder I have been phoned by a stockbroker in Rome called Legacy Global Wealth. It offered shares in Caduceus Medical Technologies which, it said, would be a hot share when it came to the US Nasdaq stockmarket. But I can&apos;t find any independent information on either the broker, or the company, being sold. Is this worth a trip to Rome to find out?MK, London  Don&apos;t waste your money on a ticket to Italy, where it claims to have an office in Rome&apos;s via Barberini. If it does so, it will be no more than a maildrop. You have to go much further afield to find the real Legacy Global Wealth offices - as far as Manila, Philippines where you&apos;ll have to take the lift to the 20th floor of the Pacific Star Building in the Makati area. Legacy Global Wealth is an unregulated boiler room. Belgium&apos;s Banking, Finance and Insurance Commission has warned consumers against the firm - and &quot;against transferring money to any account number it might mention&quot;. One that it uses is a Barclays Bank Seychelles account in the name of ZRG Holdings. Little is known about ZRG, other than it has been connected to a number of unauthorised share approaches including &quot;offers&quot; from a number of other boiler rooms. One was Bangkok-based Jackson Cole, which enriched around 20 people in the few months it carried on business in 2003. According to one ex-employee, UK investors were paying in $1m a month for worthless shares - although a fair slice of that went towards police bribes and bar girls. Jackson Cole was run by Birmingham-born Paul Hilton (not his real name - the first rule of boiler rooms is that no name is genuine). He now runs Legacy Global Wealth.  As for Caduceus, it may or may not have a brilliant method of disposing of used needles. But it has no published balance sheet - and, so far, has not revealed if it has any sales. Avoid. I lost my keys - then my insurer lost my car  My house was burgled in mid-November. Among other items, my car keys were stolen. I contacted Direct Line, my car&apos;s insurers, who took the car away the next morning for new locks to be fitted. I haven&apos;t seen it since. Can you find my car?RS, Leeds  Direct Line acted correctly in wanting to replace your locks - after all the thief could have come back for your car at some stage. But then you lost your car for over three months. Two days before the break-in, you had booked your 2002 car into a Seat dealership for clutch work. You asked Direct Line to take the car there for its engineer to approve the locks, but no engineer ever went (there was nothing to look at, as there was no damage). So Direct Line failed to authorise the Seat garage to do the work.  Just after Christmas - and after Direct Line had paid \u00a370 in compensation for delays - the car was moved to Direct Line&apos;s own garage. You were given free hire of a Ford Ka, but that was too small for your mountain bike and 5.5-metre seagoing kayak - so you were deprived of your hobbies as well. December went into January and February and still no car. Then Capital Letters intervened. Direct Line found your car, blaming problems in sourcing Seat lock parts - the main dealer you wanted might have been better. The insurer has acknowledged your pain. As well as the cost of 80 days&apos; use of a hire car and the \u00a370 it paid in December, it will now pay \u00a3300 for the clutch repair you had previously arranged with the Seat dealer, refund the \u00a3225 excess you should have paid, and treat the incident as &quot;no fault&quot;, which will cut \u00a3105 from your renewal premium. And it will pay for the new locks. The total bill is more than your car&apos;s value. How low-cost flights become high-cost I booked two flights with BMI Baby from East Midlands airport.  The first was to Amsterdam, but was cancelled due to snow. I had paid \u00a3263.43. I was advised to rebook but then decided I did not want to go. I called BMI Baby&apos;s 35p-a-minute helpline, which told me to write in. The airline then deducted \u00a310 from my ticket price and said I had to use the remaining credit they offered me by 27 August 2009. I also wanted to go to Geneva later this month but my flight, which I had booked last October, has been cancelled. The new flight goes on a Friday (rather than a Wednesday), which is not suitable. I paid \u00a3102.35 for this but the airline will only refund me \u00a395.35. Please help.SE, Nottingham  This is another example of how low-cost airlines become high-cost.  The flights were cancelled through no fault of your own but, instead of immediately offering a credit card refund, the airline made you spend 35p a minute to call it - and then only refunded a proportion of your expense.This is nonsense. You paid for a service and the airline failed to deliver. It should make a no-questions refund. After a Capital Letters call, BMI decided to return your money in full. But there is no explanation for the deductions - nor any compensation for the wasted premium phone calls or time. Tipster service turned out to be a bad bet As a disabled pensioner, I get pleasure from placing small bets on televised race meetings. I recently received a mailshot from Brando Racing in Hove, a firm of tipsters which promised a 60-day free trial and &quot;an expert team of full-time professional gamblers, offering the ultimate inside information service to a select number of genuine, reliable and honest backers&quot;. I had to sign up with a \u00a397 a month standing order but after one month the success rate was rubbish, although it had claimed between 44% and 62%. Can I get my money back?JC, Worcestershire  Standing orders involve telling your bank what to do with your money - direct debits allow the other side to claim the money. But the real problem here is that Brando will not refund the first monthly payment you made, even though most of its tips were also-rans - almost anyone can pick the occasional odds-on winner. You are not the only one with Brando problems. But those behind it seem to have disappeared. Its literature does not have a phone number, so Capital Letters called another firm in the same Hove building, which said Brando had moved on. It had apparently only ever used the place as a mailbox. Don&apos;t keep sending good money after bad I took out an 11-year endowment with Britannic Assurance 10 years ago, paying \u00a325 a month (\u00a3300 a year). It was supposed to have given me a small nest egg on retirement. However, over the past year, I have paid in \u00a3300 only to see the policy gain just \u00a310. What is happening?MC, London  You - and others - are victims of the great &quot;with-profits&quot; savings con. You were told that &quot;smoothing&quot; would free you from the ups and downs of the stock market. But that did not work. So far, you&apos;ve paid in \u00a33,000 to get \u00a32,978 - it will be less if you cash in. And it seems unlikely that the last \u00a3300 for this year will fare much better. Your plan has coincided with the worst decade for shares. But even if performance had been better, the only winner would still have been the insurer, now Phoenix. Deductions on 7.5% annual growth would have been \u00a31,400 over the first 10 years, leaving you with just \u00a33,000 (the sum you paid in).

Making allowances for collecting luggage and checking in, we estimate we have seven or eight hours for a trip into the city. Do you think this is feasible? I know the left luggage facility at the airport has been closed as a result of the terrorist threat, so we would have to take the luggage with us. As an alternative we wondered if a trip to the Taj Mahal would be possible?S Schofield, Ormskirk A I agree with your timings, but you should add one hour each way to get to and from the city. You may wish to consider hiring a car and driver to take you downtown and to what you wish to see. Metropole (metrovista.co.in) is recommended by the Lonely Planet India guide. This would give you somewhere to store your luggage (the boot of the car) but if your driver isn&apos;t staying with your vehicle he should be able to suggest a guesthouse that will look after your bags for a small fee. Alternatively, you could use the Delhi Traffic Police Prepaid Taxi Booth just outside the international terminal entrance. You&apos;ll get a prepaid voucher (around 300Rs - \u00a34) to give to the driver once you&apos;re at your destination.  You won&apos;t have time to make it to the Taj Mahal but you should be able to see the main sights of Old Delhi - the Red Fort, the National Museum and Jama Masjid mosque. You&apos;ll need a transit visa to leave the airport. Visa services are outsourced by the Indian High Commission to VFS (0905 757 0060; in.vfsglobal.co.uk). Check out India Mike (indiamike.com) for more information. Q I plan to cycle with a friend from Santander to Santiago de Compostela in the first fortnight of May. We&apos;d like to hire bikes in Santander and bring them back there by train on 16 May. Initial research indicates that bike hire for such a trip outside Santander could be difficult. Do you have any advice, especially about bike hire, as well as about places to stay en route, and information about returning by train, please?Michael McSorley, by email A  Most people take their own bikes with them on the pilgrim trail so they can be sure of a reliable and comfortable ride. However, assisting walkers and cyclists on the pilgrim routes to Santiago is a growing industry in northern Spain and it&apos;s now possible to arrange for one-way bike hire so you won&apos;t need to bring the bike back on the train. Tour&apos;n&apos;ride (tournride.com), which is based in Santiago, can deliver to locations across northern Spain and will also supply panniers, helmets and GPS. Its online booking tool quoted me \u20ac139 to hire a mountain bike for two weeks in June.  A wealth of information about accommodation along the various pilgrim routes is available on the website of the Confraternity of St James (csj.org.uk) and via its online bookshop. The easiest route back from Santiago is via the ALSA bus (alsa.es), which takes from six to eight hours, requires making a connection in Oviedo and costs \u20ac55. Be careful to travel on an inter-city bus rather than a &quot;normal&quot; service, as this will make far more stops. The train requires a change in Palencia and will be a longer journey.  Q I have a son in Sydney, who has two children under three, and a daughter in Scotland, with two children under four. We would like to get together for a family holiday next year - somewhere convenient for both families, preferably without changing planes. The time of year is open as schools are not yet an issue. What would you suggest?Bob Glaister, by email A You need to narrow this down a bit. Start with places that are easy to get to. OAG Flights (oag.com) is a good place to check and compare flight times between any two airports. As a general guide, major hub airports such as Singapore, Bangkok and Los Angeles will offer the best connections and prices, as well as being roughly halfway between Australia and the UK. Weather will be another deciding factor. Southern California is great year-round but flights are at their busiest and most expensive during December and January and from the start of July to the end of August. The same fare considerations apply to south-east Asia, but you should also consider the wet season, which can strike at different times of year depending on where exactly you head to. In Thailand, which is possibly the best destination for your family holiday, July-September and March are quite soggy, while Singapore is most prone to deluges between November and January. Weather2Travel (weather2travel.com) is the best place for further research. Q My wife and I are going to Toronto in late-May for 12 nights. We are staying with relatives for the first five nights in Toronto, but then we want to go elsewhere for a week. Can you recommend a second destination within Canada with enough to keep us occupied, great scenery and nice walks. We do not drive, so it would need to be accessible by train - we would rather not fly internally. Michael Goldby, London A The Canadian wilderness is tough to access without your own wheels. However, from Toronto you could join an expedition north. Call of the Wild (call-wild.com) offers canoeing, hiking and horse-riding trips in the Algonquin National Park, 140 miles north of Toronto, and can arrange transport. Accommodation is at the comfortable Algonquin Eco Lodge (algonquinecolodge.com, doubles from \u00a370), which is three hours by road from Toronto.  After this, Montreal would make an excellent second city destination. Easy to get to by train from Toronto (viarail.ca; from \u00a381 return), the city is packed with great architecture and museums, and has a lively Old Town and waterfront to explore.  From Montreal you can also take a bus (see hostellingtremblant.com for details) to Ville de Mont Tremblant (tremblant.ca), from where you can go hiking, canoeing, cycling or enjoy the scenery without the need for a car. Pretty much wherever you stay or what you want to do can be reached by shuttle bus.

A police spokesman said the men had cut his throat as he tried to shout for help and then thrown him overboard. Police colonel Virat Ohn-song said: &quot;We believe from our interview with his wife that Mr Robertson was dead before he was thrown into the water.&quot; Although police and the Thai navy sent out search vessels to scour the sea, Robertson&apos;s body has not been found and the search was called off late on Monday. His wife escaped with minor injuries after the attackers fled when another boat approached. Linda Robertson, who is recovering in a Thai hospital, is reported to have said: &quot;They wanted the dinghy and started hitting Malc about the head.&quot; She was photographed being brought back to dry land, with Thai officials assisting her as she stepped off the boat. Robertson and his wife each had two children from previous relationships, who are travelling to Thailand to comfort Mrs Robertson. Her brother, John Clee, said she had been tied up and held hostage in the yacht&apos;s cabin for up to 10 hours. She feared she would be killed but the three men fled, leaving her injured but alive. He said: &quot;She&apos;s got swollen arms and legs because she was tied up for eight to 10 hours in the cabin. She didn&apos;t know what was happening to Malcolm, she was kept locked up.&quot; Clee, who spoke to his sister yesterday, said the robbers took her up to the deck from time to time when they needed her help to sail the yacht. She realised her husband was probably dead when she saw there was blood all over the deck and she feared she too would be killed. As morning came, she heard the men leaving and struggled free from the ropes that bound her, before rushing up to the deck and calling to a nearby fishing boat for help. &quot;She was shouting and screaming at them,&quot; he said. Clee said Thai police caught up with the robbers quickly as they had not managed to get far on a raft, and his sister was then escorted back to land by the officers with the three men also on board. He said of the robbery: &quot;It was such a stupid, pathetic thing, because they were just trying to pinch a few credit cards and computer things.&quot; He said his sister and her husband were qualified yacht masters who had sailed round the world. He said Robertson, the owner of a chain of coffee shops in and around his home town of Hastings, East Sussex, was fulfilling a life-long dream by spending the winter months sailing around warmer climes in his 44ft (13 metre) yacht with his wife. The couple had been sailing from Phuket, where it was berthed, to the Malaysian duty-free island of Langkawi. Clee, from Battle, East Sussex, said his brother-in-law was a very popular and knowledgeable man, with a strong personality. He and his wife had seven grandchildren between them. Clee said all four children were on their way to Thailand to offer their support to his sister. Police who arrested the three men on suspicion of murder in Satun said the only apparent motive for the attack was to steal the yacht&apos;s dinghy. Colonel Voradee Karawanont, of Satun police, said: &quot;We got a report from a fishing boat as the tragedy happened offshore.

Recovering in a hospital in Satun, in southern Thailand, today, Mrs Robertson said she had been asleep, naked, in a separate cabin to her husband when the attackers struck. &quot;Three young men came in. They were holding hammers and they pushed me back and tied and gagged me. Then they went towards the forward cabin and I heard my husband shouting &apos;Get off my boat&apos;. I heard a scuffle and did not hear any more,&quot; she told the London Evening Standard. She began to think her husband was dead and later realised that a sound she took for something being moved to another boat had been her husband&apos;s body being dumped in the sea. She was tied up and put back in her cabin but the pirates brought her out to get her to show them how to work the fuel system. &quot;As I walked through the boat I realised I was walking through the blood of my husband,&quot; she said. &quot;From that moment on I knew I was just fending for my life and might have to fight for it or take my chance in the ocean. I made gestures as if to ask &apos;Are you going to kill me?&apos; &quot;They made signs to say &apos;No&apos;, they were going when they had finished.&quot; Mrs Robertson said one of the younger pirates brought her food and drink and kept saying: &quot;I am sorry.&quot; After five hours of captivity, her hands and feet were swelling from the ropes that bound them. When the men put down the anchor and started to ransack the boat, she tried to dive into the ocean but was caught and tied up even more tightly. By about 9.30am, when the boat stopped for a second time, she managed to free herself and activate an emergency radio beacon. She saw the pirates heading away from the yacht in a rubber dinghy and quickly started the engine and headed towards a fleet of fishing boats. &quot;I jumped off my boat on to the fishing boat. I would not go back to my boat. I did not want to feel Malcolm&apos;s blood on my feet,&quot; she said. Shortly afterwards, the police arrived with the pirates. &quot;I recognised them immediately. Some of them were even wearing Malcolm&apos;s clothes. I hope they find Malcolm&apos;s body, but I have no idea of the lats and longs [latitudes and longitudes], of where he was thrown overboard,&quot; she said.

After testifying at two court hearings in the town of Satun, recounting step by step how she heard her husband being murdered, and how she stepped in his blood before making a final escape, Linda Robertson said she was shocked by the decision. &quot;I can&apos;t believe the decision by prosecutors,&quot; she said. &quot;I am in a state of total disbelief. These young men were almost caught red-handed. They confessed to everything. The police even have the bloodstained murder weapon. Yet there is no murder charge, not even a manslaughter charge. It&apos;s incredible.&quot; Currently the three Burmese have only been charged with theft, assault and kidnap. Earlier in the day the Thai police had reported that a body had been found by a fisherman, but that turned out to be a false alarm. Colonel Lerdchai Thinra said: &quot;I was told that the body had been found. I contacted Bangkok immediately to report to the family. &quot;Some of the fishing boats told the police station around there that he had found a body. I sent a speedboat up there immediately but it was not there.&quot; The Foreign Office said: &quot;The Thai authorities are continuing their investigation and are still searching the area.&quot; But the chances of finding the body in the Bintang Island group, notorious for its switching currents, are getting slimmer. Mrs Robertson, 57, was comforted by her two sons, after testifying for nearly 10 hours in two separate hearings, beginning in the morning and ending at 7.30pm. In the morning hearing she testified against Burmese migrant fishermen Aow, 18, and Ek, 19, in Satun provincial court. In the second hearing, in Satun juvenile court, she testified against 17-year-old Ko, an orphan, whom she described as the gentler of her attackers. &quot;He gave me food and water. He said sorry many times and gave me hope that I would live.&quot; The couple, from St Leonards in East Sussex, had been sailing their yacht, Mr Bean, from Phuket to the Malaysian island of Langkawi. They were attacked when they were moored off Bintang Island in Tarutao National Marine Park on Tuesday morning. Their attackers swam out to the mooring. Mr Robertson was attacked as he tried to throw the amateur pirates off the boat. The Burmese admitted bludgeoning him to death with a hammer. They then had what Mrs Robertson described as a &quot;noisy picnic&quot; on the boat. She made her escape after the three men tried to take control of the boat a second time when their getaway dinghy broke down.

Local newspapers are disappearing. National newspapers and commercial TV stations are seeing the web take their advertisers. Even the gloomiest forecasters expect there will still be a few reporters around in 2025, but as with blacksmiths, we will be curiosities. There is no point arguing against the inevitable and many optimists believe that the destruction of the old order should be welcomed. In Here Comes Everybody, Clay Shirky celebrates the switch to a democratic world where publishing costs next to nothing and anyone with access to a computer can write for an audience which in theory extends to everyone with a computer on the planet. He quotes the example of Alisara Chirapongse, a marvellous Thai student who blogged mainly about fashion. Her readership was tiny, until the 2006 Thai military coup. Chirapongse ignored a news blackout and described life in Bangkok. She posted photos of mutinous troops on her website and organised a campaign against the army&apos;s attempts at censorship. When the crisis was over, international admirers left and she went back to sharing thoughts with her friends. Newspaper correspondents in Thailand may have been censored by the military. If their editors had sent them in from London, they may not have known the language or understood Thai politics. It is possible that Alisara&apos;s writing was not only equal to the work of her professional rivals but superior and more widely read. Why, then, mourn the passing of the hack? The best reason for wanting my colleagues to survive is that serious reporters and broadcasters offer a guarantee that what they say is true. If they stray, their editors impose journalistic standards and insist on objectivity. They may not have the best or fullest story or the most vivid account, but readers should be able to assume their work is reliable, while a blogger&apos;s commitment to objectivity can never be assumed. The BBC offers the most comprehensive guarantee. Politicians and lobbyists want to influence it more than any other news organisation because, despite occasional lapses, its reporters have earned the right to be believed. The corporation should be becoming the most important news institution not merely in Britain but the world. The technological changes that are wrecking the profitability of newspapers and commercial TV in all advanced countries mean that many will think hard before sending a reporter to cover the next coup in Thailand. The BBC, whose \u00a33bn income is guaranteed by the state, should have no comparable worries. Yet far from looking like confident men and women ready to fill the gaps left by their retreating competitors, BBC journalists are a harried and miserable bunch. This week, they will strike over a threat to jobs in Asian branches of the World Service. Despite the obscurity of the cause, union members voted 77% in favour of action because they fear that they will be next. To use old-fashioned language, they are caught in a class war. Wealthy managers, 50 of whom earn more than the prime minister, have turned on their less fortunate subordinates. After Jonathan Ross&apos;s obscene phone calls, the management made reporters go on childish courses to teach them how to be good boys and girls, even though the scandal had nothing to do with them. At the March meeting of the BBC Trust, Mark Thompson, the director-general, described how he had cut 7,200 jobs since 2005 and was planning to cut another 1,200. South America, West Africa and much of Europe are barely covered, while the best British programmes are downsized. Managers have reduced the number of journalists working for Radio 4&apos;s Today from 17 to seven. After imposing years of cost squeezes, they are insisting that Newsnight accept a further 12.5% reduction in its budget. At the morning conference on what the news agenda of the day should be, editors don&apos;t always listen to their reporters but run after stories from the Mail, Guardian and Telegraph. Every newspaper editor I know is trying to think of ways to maintain reporting standards, but they fear they are fighting a losing battle. The BBC is not thinking about how it will cope if one day the Mail, Guardian and Telegraph don&apos;t have any stories. The net is partly to blame for the downgrading of journalism, but not, for once, because it is destroying a news organisation&apos;s business model. The BBC has willingly poured hundreds of millions into developing its online sites and iPlayer, while getting as far away as possible from the democratic hopes of Shirky. He justifies his enthusiasm by describing the writers and networkers who have used technology to campaign against abuses of power. In other words, he cares about content as much as process. The BBC is so uninterested in content that it is sacking its content providers or journalists as we used to call them. The paradox of the BBC&apos;s strategy is that the more it spends on expanding into cyberspace the less it has to say. Once, the disputes within the corporation would have been a local affair. Now, as traditional media contract, they are of national and maybe international importance. No rival can fill the gaps if the BBC pulls back from comprehensive reliable reporting. Soon, if its camera crews do not go to Nigeria, no one else&apos;s will. All over the world, there are Alisara Chirapongses providing breadth and depth, which we never experienced in the 20th century. They find it harder to provide a solid record of events, which others can refer to and move on from. Critics of the BBC say that it is using the power of its protected status to take audiences from its rivals and there&apos;s some truth in that. They should be as worried about the type of BBC its managers are creating and how patchy and thin its news coverage is becoming. In this time of upheaval, the BBC has a public duty to invest and broadcast the journalism that others cannot afford. It is failing spectacularly to live up to its responsibilities. \u2022 Nick Cohen&apos;s essays, Waiting for the Etonians, are out now from 4th Estate", "publicationDate": "2009-03-29T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["BBC", "Newspapers & magazines", "Internet", "Blogging", "Technology", "Media", "BBC Trust"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/29/bbc-bloggers-journalism", "title": "Nick Cohen: Who would you rather trust - the BBC or a blogger?", "sentences": ["Chirapongse ignored a news blackout and described life in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Forget Gordon Brown&apos;s recent love-in with Barack Obama in Washington. What about his extraordinarily intense relationship with Thailand&apos;s new prime minister? Brown first met him in Davos in January, invited him to next week&apos;s G20 conference in London and, if that wasn&apos;t enough, hosted him a fortnight ago in Downing Street. Three encounters in three months. Not bad for a man in power for barely a hundred days. It helps, of course, that Abhisit Vejjajiva is an Anglophile, born in Britain, educated at Eton and with a first-class degree from Oxford. His brains and international sophistication \u2013 unique for a Thai prime minister \u2013 have made him the darling of Bangkok&apos;s diplomats while his fierce opposition to former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who fled last year to avoid imprisonment, delights most of the urban middle class. But Abhisit faces an uphill struggle in wooing investors as the world recession intensifies. The country&apos;s image lies in tatters. First came a military coup in 2006, a throwback to a pre-globalisation era. Last year, in spite of the restoration of civilian rule, increasing polarisation led to months of demonstrations by &quot;yellow shirts&quot; v &quot;red shirts&quot; which culminated in the occupation of government house and Bangkok&apos;s airports \u2013 blatant crimes for which no-one has been charged. Then came a judicial coup, with the courts banning the then prime minister and over a hundred other politicians, thereby paving the way for Abhisit to be voted into power by a rump parliament. Are the roots of the crisis economic or political? Globalisation has increased the gap between the country&apos;s still huge rural population and the cities in spite of Thaksin&apos;s welfare reforms. Landing in Bangkok, you see well-watered paddy fields glinting in the sunlight, but drive two hours east and vast acreages lie fallow in the dry season, their farmers unable to afford irrigation. Thousands of others have lost their land to forestry projects, dam-building, or gas pipelines.  Thaksin, who was the first man to complete a full term and be re-elected, mobilised the rural population. Yet his much-needed pro-poor policies and welfare subsidies did not cut into the lifestyle of Bangkok&apos;s middle class. The city&apos;s spacious and tasteful shopping centres make Bond Street and Oxford Street look crowded and tatty. What turned many in Bangkok against Thaksin was his media manipulation and political bullying while the old elite, rooted in royalism, the military, and an ossified civil service hated his challenge to their power. Chaiwat Satha-Anand, a political scientist at Thammasat University, describes Thaksin&apos;s system as &quot;authoritarian democracy&quot;. He was elected fairly by people who &quot;could vote a government in but not influence the ways in which it governs&quot;. In office, Thaksin increasingly monopolised decision-making, controlled TV, and enriched himself and his friends. By contrast, Thailand&apos;s previous system, restored by the 2006 military coup, is &quot;democratic authoritarianism&quot; in which civil rights are granted as long as they don&apos;t threaten the country&apos;s traditional rulers. Others describe Thaksin as an ideologically confusing mixture of Venezuela&apos;s Hugo Chavez and Italy&apos;s businessman-politician Silvio Berlusconi. Satha-Anand as well as a leading human rights lawyer, Somchai Homlaor, say political violence under Thaksin was unprecedented. Thousands were murdered by the police and army in a &quot;war on drugs&quot;. Environmental activists disappeared, and an insurgency by the Muslim minority in southern Thailand was met with massive repression. &quot;The culture of impunity, especially in the police, is very strong. No government even now can bring them to justice&quot;, Homlaor argues. Thaksin&apos;s beneficial economic record cannot be undone, and Abhisit is keeping most of his programmes, including giving cheques to millions of low-income families as part of a stimulus package. The former prime minister&apos;s political shadow still looms. Claiming his trial was politically motivated and flawed, he still addresses rallies by phone from abroad. His remaining MPs are planning a no-confidence motion in Abhisit and want amnesty for all banned politicians (mainly their colleagues).  Yet after the turmoil of the last 30 months the country&apos;s politics seem to have relaxed. A pro-Thaksin rally that I watched in Bangkok last month felt ritualistic and good-natured rather than angry. (Another one yesterday seems to have been similar in tone). The protesters did not try to storm government house, so as to keep the moral high ground compared with the anti-Thaksin People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD) behaviour last year. Now the PAD is discussing whether to abandon street politics and become a party, a move which could split the anti-Thaksin vote when elections are called. Homlaor takes an optimistic view. Although recent events tarnished the image of Thais as &quot;soft smiling people&quot;, he believes there is greater restraint than in his student days &quot;when protesters rushed to gun-shops to be able to fire on the police&quot;. Only ten have died in political violence since 2006 compared to much larger numbers in the turmoil of 1973, 1976, and 1992. The coup of 2006 lasted little more than a year. &quot;We&apos;ve created a norm that the military will not seize and retain power, and a politician will not become a dictator under a parliamentary system&quot;, he says. There is increasing debate about Thailand&apos;s biggest taboo, the role of the monarchy, and the draconian lese-majeste laws which criminalise critics. &quot;The King favours the other side, but we can&apos;t say that. They&apos;ll put us in gaol. We call him the invisible hand&quot;, a middle-aged woman on the pro-Thaksin march told me.  Kavi Chongkittavorn of the Bangkok paper the Nation highlights a paradox that runs against China&apos;s paradigm of a controlled press and an increasingly free web. In Thailand, he says, &quot;while the printed and general media environment is pretty free, filtering of the internet is on the rise, judging from the numbers of blocked and shut websites&quot;. The authorities claim they contained pornography or insulted the monarchy, but Chongkittavorn says only about 100 of the 4,800 shut sites were pornographic. The rest dealt with the monarchy and &quot;most were just disapproving, nothing serious&quot;.  Where does this leave Abhisit, as he strives to present a modern face to the world? The Bangkok pundits point out that his government shut over 2000 websites, angering young middle-class Thais. They applaud his promise to revive the stalled investigation of one of the most prominent abuses under Thaksin, the police abduction of a well-known human rights lawyer. But until the killers are brought to justice it is too early to know if official impunity is ending. Abhisit has talked of improving the way the lese-majeste laws are &quot;interpreted&quot;, a phrase he used in a Financial Times interview. This sounds like interfering in the administration of justice rather than persuading parliament to soften or scrap the law. Thailand&apos;s economic recession is as serious as every other country&apos;s. Gordon Brown may be enamoured by Abhisit&apos;s efforts on that front. But most Thais know their prime minister&apos;s control over global financial forces is limited.

Ghost Rider achieved a result comparable with Knowing (\u00a31.85m in March 2007), but it benefited from being based on an established property, the Marvel comicbook of the same name. Last year&apos;s National Treasure: Book of Secrets did even better (a debut of \u00a32.48m), but then it had the advantage of being a PG-rated family flick as well as being the follow-up to a sizeable action-adventure hit.

It&apos;s a decent result for the DreamWorks animation, especially at the 136 regular 3-D and seven Imax 3-D sites, but a tad below the previews achieved by Disney&apos;s Bolt in early February. Debuting on 236 screens, The Damned United, Peter Morgan&apos;s adaptation of the David Peace book, began with a respectable \u00a3619,000. Since the film concerns football manager Brian Clough&apos;s disastrous 44-day tenure at Leeds United FC in 1974, industry observers had questioned the appeal of this film to a) women and b) anyone too young to remember the events. That would leave as a core audience males over 45, arguably the demographic most likely to watch movies in comfort at home on widescreen TV. So backers Sony might be relieved by the result, which is comparable with the openings of Morgan&apos;s recent films Frost/Nixon (\u00a3591,000) and The Queen (\u00a3856,000), which both likewise starred Michael Sheen. Among other releases, a mediocre opening for Traitor \u2013 \u00a379,000 from 127 theatres for a \u00a3619 average \u2013 would seem to confirm received wisdom that Middle East terrorism is not an easy sell at the box office and that actors in the range of Don Cheadle and Guy Pearce are not big enough stars to open a mainstream thriller.  Meanwhile James Toback&apos;s Tyson, which took barely more than \u00a34,000 from five venues, proves that acres of publicity and mostly positive reviews will not automatically propel audiences into cinemas to watch sports documentaries. The well-regarded Once in a Lifetime: The Extraordinary Story of the New York Cosmos suffered a similar fate in 2006. A year later In the Hands of the Gods \u2013 an amiable account of five freestyle footballers chasing their dream across the Americas \u2013 opened with just \u00a312,000 from 63 screens, despite a well-orchestrated marketing and publicity campaign. Tyson, like those recent football-themed docs, should recover on DVD. Slumdog Millionaire&apos;s dogged rise up the UK&apos;s all-time box-office chart claimed three fresh victims this week: with takings now at \u00a331,014,496, Danny Boyle&apos;s crowdpleaser overtook The Da Vinci Code, War of the Worlds and Notting Hill in the past seven days, and must now pass Gladiator (\u00a331,201,143) to land the No 40 spot in the rankings. Overall, the top 15 films in the UK this week were up a slim 4% on the corresponding weekend in 2008, when 27 Dresses opened at No 1. However this calculation omits the hefty Monsters Vs Aliens previews from the current weekend figures. Added in, the rise against a year ago is more like 22% \u2013 very much par for the course in this highly buoyant year at the UK box office.

But the consolation prize \u2013 an infusion of $500bn into IMF coffers \u2013 gave the Anglo Saxon leaders something to trumpet.  Their brand of casino capitalism may have spawned multiple credit bubbles across a wide swathe of emerging market economies. But as eastern Europe and many other countries slide towards depression, their governments can rest assured. The global cop of last resort, the IMF, will come to the rescue.  Many will shudder at the thought. When the SE Asian bubble burst in 1997, IMF staffers were sent to Bangkok, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta to impose tough conditions for loans that still failed to prevent exchange rates from collapsing.  In return for emergency loans, they demanded a draconian and anti-Keynesian tightening of fiscal policy that drove the Asian economies deeper into recession.  We wait to see if similar terms and conditions will be applied today. Judging from the myriad bailouts launched by the IMF since last year, nothing has changed since 1997. It is still one rule for the west, another for the rest.  Indeed, it was the IMF intervention in 1997 that persuaded central banks across developing countries never to be left so dependent upon the west again. They vowed to drive their foreign exchange reserves higher, to provide a cushion against financial crises. But that merely aggravated trade imbalances and provided the fuel for the global credit bubble of 2004-2008.  When it all came crashing down, record reserves were still unable to cushion these countries from the incompetence of western governments.  And trebling the IMF&apos;s kitty will not resolve the core immediate problem facing the world economy \u2013 a collapsing US housing market. Ironically, the Bank of England&apos;s rapid fire rate cuts are gaining traction, with some signs of a stabiliation in the UK housing market.  Obama can only dream. The US took the world into recession, and it may take many countries into depression yet. The collapse of the US housing market is accelerating because, for ideological reasons, the Obama administration will not nationalise its banks and intervene to stabilise its housing market. Obama&apos;s plans are little different from those seen in the final months of the Bush administration. February saw a record decline in house prices across 20 major US cities, because banks are unable and unwilling to pass on rate cuts to homeowners. Average property values are now 30% below their peak, but they could easily fall that far again.  Unemployment in the US is soaring. March could be the worst month yet for job losses, as the wider &quot;U6&quot; unemployment rate, including discouraged and involuntary part-time workers, soars to 20% and beyond.  One in eight homeowners with a mortgage will have been in arrears or in default by the end of March. That could climb to one in seven or one in six over the summer. Obama is not facing up to the scale of economic and social catastrophe facing his country.  And not even a bigger IMF will be able to fix that.", "publicationDate": "2009-04-02T16:59:55Z", "tags": ["G20", "International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "US housing and sub-prime crisis", "Global recession", "Credit crunch", "Financial crisis", "Business", "Barack Obama", "US economy", "Obama administration", "World news", "Politics", "US news", "US politics"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/apr/02/g20-imf", "title": "Graham Turner: G20: Trebling the IMF's kitty will not solve the immediate problem", "sentences": ["When the SE Asian bubble burst in 1997, IMF staffers were sent to Bangkok, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta to impose tough conditions for loans that still failed to prevent exchange rates from collapsing."]}, {"article": "Several soldiers died in a clash between Thai and Cambodian troops near an 11th century temple, with each side blaming the other for the latest flare-up in a disputed border area. Cambodian officials said four Thai soldiers died and 10 were detained as troops fired at each other with machine guns and rocket launchers. Seni Chittakasem, the governor of Thailand&apos;s eastern Si Sa Ket province, confirmed that one Thai soldier was killed and said seven were wounded. The incident was the latest in a long-festering dispute over the cliff-top Preah Vihear temple on the Cambodian side of an ill-defined border. Clashes in the area last year briefly brought fear of war. A clash this morning was followed by artillery fire that lasted about 30 minutes. Thailand&apos;s defence minister, Prawit Wongsuwan, played down the fighting. &quot;It was an accident, a misunderstanding among officials on the ground, which is common when you are closely positioned,&quot; he told reporters in Bangkok. A Cambodian soldier posted at the border, Yeim Kheang, told Agence France-Presse by telephone that a Cambodian market at the gateway to the temple had been badly burned during the fighting. &quot;We used heavy weapons including rockets, machine guns and mortars. In general, we used every weapon given to us. Many Thai soldiers ran away, leaving their weapons behind during the fight,&quot; he said. Tensions had been high since an exchange of shots early in the morning after Cambodian soldiers went to investigate the area where a Thai soldier stepped on a mine on Thursday and lost his leg. The exchange of fire came two days after Hun Sen, the Cambodian prime minister, warned Thailand of fighting if its troops crossed their disputed frontier. Thailand denies claims that about 100 troops crossed the frontier a week ago. The Thai prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, said he was ready to call his Cambodian counterpart but defended Bangkok&apos;s right to &quot;preserve our sovereignty.&quot; &quot;It was likely caused by a misunderstanding or accident. I have asked every agency to work to solve the incident by creating a better understanding with Cambodia,&quot; he said on his return from the G20 summit in London. Hun Sen and Abhisit are both scheduled to take part in a summit between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and key regional partners in the Thai beach resort of Pattaya next week. The temple is located in an area that has long been a source of contention as Thailand and Cambodia share an 800-kilometre (500-mile) border, much of which has never been clearly demarcated because the countries refer to different maps. Cambodia&apos;s French colonial masters claimed the temple, using a disputed 1907 map that marked the frontier. But when the French left in 1954, Thai troops seized the ruin. They only grudgingly left after the international court of justice in The Hague awarded it to Cambodia in 1962, but they held on to an adjacent 4.6 square kilometre patch of disputed scrub. The court&apos;s ruling has rankled with Thai nationalists since then. When the UN awarded Preah Vihear world heritage site status in July last year, it once again became a flashpoint. Subsequent talks between Cambodia and Thailand have not resolved the dispute and Thailand&apos;s foreign minister apologised yesterday, after being accused by Hun Sen of calling him a gangster. Preah Vihear has become a burning issue in Thailand&apos;s fraught domestic politics. Analysts say the Abhisit government \u2013 already perceived as ineffectual \u2013 cannot afford to be seen as weak on the issue. &quot;This is so touchy for the Thai government as it is seen as a test of its mettle,&quot; said Tim Forsyth, a Thailand expert at the London School of Economics. &quot;It is all part of a crisis of legitimacy for the government.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-04-03T13:16:27Z", "tags": ["Cambodia", "Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/03/thailand-cambodia-temple-clashes", "title": "Soldiers die in new clash at temple flashpoint on Thai-Cambodia border", "sentences": ["&quot;It was an accident, a misunderstanding among officials on the ground, which is common when you are closely positioned,&quot; he told reporters in Bangkok.", "The Thai prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, said he was ready to call his Cambodian counterpart but defended Bangkok&apos;s right to &quot;preserve our sovereignty.&quot; &quot;It was likely caused by a misunderstanding or accident."]}, {"article": "From the aisle, Graham Langley looks on as I grip the red handles of the Boeing 767&apos;s over-wing emergency exit with clammy hands. &quot;If there&apos;s an issue and you need to leave in a hurry,&quot; he says, in the soothing euphemisms that flight attendants use to describe unimaginable pandemonium, &quot;the first thing to do is look out of the window. If you find there&apos;s a water level there ...&quot; He traces an imaginary line halfway up the porthole window with his finger. &quot;... You don&apos;t want to open the door.&quot; As instructed, I check for unexpected hazards, give the door a good heave, then recoil as it falls heavily into my lap. It&apos;s hard not to think of the recent aviation near-disaster in New York, the &quot;issue&quot; there being the loss of both engines and the &quot;need to leave in a hurry&quot; after the plane&apos;s subsequent emergency landing in the freezing Hudson river. Miraculously, all 155 passengers on board escaped alive, many by escaping through over-wing emergency exits similar to this.  Beyond the door is a vast hangar full of cross-sections of various aircraft mounted on giant, hydraulic plinths of differing heights. Inflatable slides hang off at tangents. It looks like a huge indoor amusement park, albeit one in which rows of svelte pilots glide demurely along the overhead gantries where one might expect to find hordes of stampeding kids. Langley has just returned from crewing flights to and from Dakar, Senegal. In a couple of days he is off to Accra in Ghana. After that it&apos;s on to Vancouver, then it might be Mexico, S\u00e3o Paulo or Bangkok. &quot;Rather sadly, I&apos;ve kept a log of how many miles I&apos;ve flown,&quot; he admits, a little sheepishly. &quot;It&apos;s now about 2.7m, which is something like 100 times around the world.&quot; Today, though, he is in the more homely surroundings of Cranebank, British Airways&apos;s safety training centre near Heathrow. Like all BA flight personnel, he must attend a three-day refresher course here every year, when his knowledge of everything from emergency doors to jungle survival techniques is rigorously evaluated.  By his reckoning the 767 simulator we are sitting in is &quot;a reasonably good mock-up&quot; of the real thing. During an actual training drill, he explains, a computer runs a random scenario. &quot;You&apos;ll be attending to your passengers, then a voice will say, &apos;This is the captain, this is the situation.&apos; And you have to think, &apos;what would we do here?&apos;&quot;  He might, for example, be blindfolded and given orders by mock-hijackers. &quot;Then after, in the debrief, you&apos;re asked to remember things like what they said to you, what did they sound like, that sort of thing.&quot; When Langley boarded his first flight as a professional in 2000, security was already an established part of cabin crew training, if not to the extent it is today. &quot;It was a more innocent time,&quot; he remembers, as we reconvene for coffee in a meeting room flooded with bright spring sunlight. &quot;We couldn&apos;t have envisaged what would happen. You always thought security was going to mean hijacking and that you were going to be flying to Cuba or somewhere, then have hostage negotiations on the ground. That was our perception. But now the world has changed. Now there&apos;s another aspect.&quot;  On the afternoon of 11 September 2001, having watched the terrorist attacks on New York unfold at home on television, he reported for work as usual, joining the crew of a domestic flight to Newcastle. &quot;Everybody watched the safety demo on that flight,&quot; he says, pointedly. &quot;Maybe two or three days later I felt a little differently, but on that day I got on to the plane thinking, they&apos;re not going to do this. They&apos;re not going to win.&quot; Flying may never be quite the same experience again, but it is also good to know that some endearing rituals from the age of innocence live on. Contrary to popular belief, for example, he says small children can still tour the cockpit, just not while the plane is in flight. &quot;We&apos;ve lost a lot through that, but there&apos;s nothing you can do,&quot; he reflects ruefully. &quot;The pilots want to make contact. During a flight they&apos;re locked in a room with one other person and what they really want is company.&quot; With his cheerful demeanour and spotless navy uniform, Langley certainly looks the part. Of course there is also the obligatory flight attendant&apos;s tan, betraying the fact that he spends much of the winter in sunnier climes.  But in other ways, he doesn&apos;t fit the stereotype at all. For a start he is in his early 50s, with two teenage children at home near Slough who keep him firmly grounded. &quot;When they were younger I stayed on European flights so I could be home most days,&quot; he says. Flying worldwide as he does now can mean he is away for several days at a time, but he says things are easier now his kids are older. &quot;They probably feel they don&apos;t need me around as much, I might as well admit it,&quot; he says, chuckling. &quot;But I do find that when I&apos;m at home now, I&apos;m definitely at home.&quot; In fact, it was the kids of Slough who first motivated him to take flight. Ground down by 20 years of teaching secondary school geography and PE - &quot;like painting the Forth bridge: every year you have to start again&quot; - he took one look at the next crop of GCSE candidates and decided enough was enough. &quot;I was a head of year and I was looking for a change. I guess I was halfway though my working life,&quot; he recalls. &quot;A friend of mine was a BA worldwide stewardess and seeing her lifestyle, I thought I&apos;d give it a go, sort of suck it and see. And I really haven&apos;t looked back.&quot; Langley soon realised the tricks of his former trade would also serve him well. Even now he admits to relishing the prospect of a cabin full of unruly kids on a school trip. &quot;I taught 16-year-olds, so anything after that is easy,&quot; he says, grinning. &quot;It&apos;s an acting job. I&apos;m a natural born show-off, I guess.&quot; I assume his career path is fairly unusual for cabin crew, but no, he says there are all sorts of career changers heaving drinks trolleys up and down the economy aisles. &quot;We&apos;ve got nurses, people doing law degrees, people writing novels who bring their laptops with them and work in the hotels, whatever. I met a psychiatrist recently on a crew; there are lots of people who have far more to offer than just this job.&quot; If he had ever imagined there was a glamorous side to the job, though, he was soon put straight. &quot;That&apos;s a myth,&quot; he says, firmly. &quot;I don&apos;t know if it ever was, but at the risk of sounding a bit crude, it&apos;s more about trying to manage your sleep than sleeping around.&quot;  On long flights there are bunks on the plane so half the crew can rest while the other half work. While his duties are obviously more pressing during take-off and landing, there is a sobering need to stay vigilant throughout. &quot;You&apos;re constantly checking to make sure people haven&apos;t passed out in their seats,&quot; he says. &quot;I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s the ex-teacher in me but when you look down the cabin, you can sense when something isn&apos;t quite right.&quot; Other crew members, he thinks, like the job for the fact that you can shop the world, or sit by a pool and top up the tan, or even just get away from the kids for a few days. &quot;But that isn&apos;t me,&quot; he says smiling. &quot;I&apos;m just an obsessive traveller. I think, &apos;I&apos;ve got 25 hours here, I&apos;ve got to sleep for 10, what am I going to do with the rest of the time?&apos; So I try to see something of the country, find out what it&apos;s like to live there.&quot; He recalls the afternoon he caught a local bus out to the Iraqi border during a round trip to Kuwait. &quot;There was a camel and a sign saying, &apos;Basra, 30km&apos;,&quot; he recalls. &quot;I was thinking, &apos;This is interesting&apos;. All around in the desert were military vehicles that had been part of the first Gulf war. I realised there might be lots of unexploded bombs around, so I just stood on the road, enjoying the scenery.&quot; He pauses, temporarily lost in the moment. &quot;That&apos;s not normal crew behaviour, I have to say, but I love doing that.&quot; And when pressed about memorable destinations, he immediately thinks not of the beach bars of Barbados, but of freezing days spent roaming the grey, concrete streets of Warsaw. &quot;You have to work hard to scratch the surface, but I quite like that,&quot; he says, almost dreamily. &quot;I once took a copy of The Pianist there and sat and read it in one go. I know it&apos;s a cliche but I really enjoyed it. And it doesn&apos;t have all those franchise shops. They&apos;re all Polish.&quot; A bit like Slough then, I suggest? &quot;At least I know where people in Slough are coming from,&quot; he says, laughing. And, it is quite likely, where they are going next as well. Curriculum vitae Pay: Around \u00a316k basic plus significant extras. &quot;I get allowances for speaking Spanish and for time abroad.&quot; Hours: &quot;There is no pattern to life at all. This week I&apos;m reporting on a Wednesday afternoon, the next one could be a Monday morning.&quot; Langley receives his rota six weeks in advance.  Work-life balance: Tricky. &quot;But it&apos;s much better now. I&apos;m at home for chunks of time, so I&apos;m not thinking about when I&apos;m flying off again.&quot; Best thing: &quot;The lack of stress compared to teaching.&quot; Worst thing: &quot;When you miss a night&apos;s sleep. So you&apos;re trying to catch up when you get home.

Dressed in red, the massive crowd marched through Bankok&apos;s historic northern district, overtaking main boulevards and waving pictures of their leader-in-exile, Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted by a 2006 coup after six years as prime minister. The protesters say Abhisit, who was appointed by parliament in December, took power illegitimately and should step aside so parliament can be dissolved ahead of fresh elections. Protesters headed to the home of King Bhumibol Adulyadej&apos;s top adviser, Prem Tinsulanonda, whom they accuse of masterminding the coup. They are also demanding Prem&apos;s resignation and have accused the military, judiciary and Prem&apos;s inner circle of interfering in politics. &quot;Brothers and sisters, come out. If you love democracy, come out. If you want an end to elite rule, come out,&quot; protest leaders aboard trucks shouted through megaphones. &quot;Abhisit, get out. Prem, get out.&quot; More than 4,000 police were deployed in the area, where the all-day protest was planned, with the army on standby and authorities urging the general public to avoid the area. Prem&apos;s house was guarded by riot police. Today&apos;s rally comes after a two-week sit-in outside Abhisit&apos;s office but marked the largest turnout yet. Abhisit rejected the protesters demands and said he planned to carry on with his day as usual. &quot;The government will not dissolve parliament,&quot; Abhisit told reporters after launching an anti-drunk driving campaign ahead of the Thai New Year next week. &quot;We will only do so if it is an appropriate solution. We will not respond to threats of violence.&quot; At least 80,000 people are expected to gather, said Bangkok police chief lieutenant general Worapong Chiewpreecha. Police did not have an early crowd count, saying there were tens of thousands after the march started. Abhisit said there would be no order to disperse the crowd if they remained orderly. &quot;If it becomes a riot, the government will have to do something,&quot; Abhisit said in an interview with Channel 3 television. &quot;I can assure you there will no violence starting from the government&apos;s side,&quot; Abhisit said. &quot;There are some people who want chaos, but the government will do everything to restrain them.&quot; Prem has denied the accusations that he orchestrated the coup, but the rare public criticism of a king&apos;s privy counsellor broke a taboo in Thailand, where members of the monarchy and their aides are highly revered. Prem had been indirectly accused of orchestrating the coup before; the last rally outside his home in July 2007 turned into a riot in which more than 200 people were injured. On the eve of the rally, a car carrying Abhisit was attacked by protesters, but he escaped unharmed. The attack yesterday occurred as Abhisit left a cabinet meeting in the coastal resort of Pattaya, about 90 miles (145 km) south of Bangkok, where Asian leaders will gather on Friday for a summit. Thaksin, who was ousted amid accusations of corruption and abuse of power, has been addressing the protests via video link from exile. He fled the country last year before a court convicted him of abuse of power and sentenced him to two years in prison. &quot;This will be a historic day,&quot; Thaksin told his supporters yesterday evening, his image on a giant screen outside Government House. &quot;I want to urge my Thai brothers and sisters who love freedom and justice ... to gather in large numbers and show your power.&quot; Most of Thaksin&apos;s supporters are from the country&apos;s poor rural majority, who benefited from his populist policies. They are known as &quot;the red shirts,&quot; for their favoured attire. The protests are the latest episode in Thailand&apos;s long-running political turmoil, a tug-of-war between Thaksin&apos;s supporters and opponents. Last year was dominated by protests from Thaksin&apos;s opponents, who wore yellow shirts. They occupied the Government House for three months and shutdown Bangkok&apos;s two airports for a week. Their protests ended in December after courts removed two pro-Thaksin prime ministers from office, paving the way for Abhisit to take power in parliament in December.", "publicationDate": "2009-04-08T05:10:07Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/08/thailand-protests-abhisit-vejjajiva", "title": "Abhisit Vejjajiva, Thailand's prime minister, rejects calls for resignation as thousands protest", "sentences": ["Thailand&apos;s prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, rejected calls for his resignation as tens of thousands of protesters marched today in Bangkok, posing the biggest challenge to his government amid fears of violence.", "We will not respond to threats of violence.&quot; At least 80,000 people are expected to gather, said Bangkok police chief lieutenant general Worapong Chiewpreecha.", "The attack yesterday occurred as Abhisit left a cabinet meeting in the coastal resort of Pattaya, about 90 miles (145 km) south of Bangkok, where Asian leaders will gather on Friday for a summit.", "They occupied the Government House for three months and shutdown Bangkok&apos;s two airports for a week."]}, {"article": "Hundreds of anti-government protesters are converging outside the Asia summit venue, saying they will enter the complex unless the Thai prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva resigns.

About 2,000 red-shirted supporters of the former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was deposed in a coup in 2006, confronted police and troops outside the luxury hotel where the summit is being held, demanding that the government of the current prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, step down. But tensions eased later after an official from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) emerged from the hotel to accept a letter from the demonstrators. Protest leader Arisman Pongreungrong said they had agreed to leave the site for now and to unblock roads leading to the summit venue. But he said the protesters would regroup in the town, a few miles away from the hotel, and discuss whether to return to the summit if their demands were not met. The action in the town, 90 miles south-east of Bangkok, follows three days of huge protests in the capital. Mass protests began on Wednesday, with 100,000 people surrounding Abhisit&apos;s office at Government House in the capital. Abhisit has been forced to declare today a public holiday, hoping it will be easier to control the demonstrations with fewer people in Bangkok. In a televised address yesterday, Abhisit said he wanted to ease the inconvenience to the public caused by the protests, and make it easier to identify troublemakers.

When most of us enter a new workplace, at best we might agonise about how soon to reveal that enormous tattoo on our ankle or whether to disclose that we once appeared on Cash in the Attic. If we&apos;re lucky, we can even get away with inventing a whole new persona which will see us through our career.  But for some workers, their entire history is an open book as soon as they accept the job offer.  For 43-year-old Sandra Gregory from Sowerby Bridge in West Yorkshire, there is no reinventing the past.  Gregory was arrested in 1993 after attempting to smuggle heroin from Thailand to Tokyo. Originally sentenced to 25 years in jail, she spent four years in Thailand&apos;s Lard Yao prison, known as the Bangkok Hilton, before being repatriated and pardoned by the king of Thailand in 2000. Her story attracted huge media attention nationwide and her name and face became well-known.  Gregory was released in 2001. &quot;I came home and realised I didn&apos;t have a life,&quot; she says. &quot;Nothing to do, no money, no structure. I had no proper qualifications.&quot;  However, she had nearly completed an Open University degree and, after an 18-month break, went to Oxford University as a mature student. Gregory didn&apos;t disclose her background on her application, merely saying that she had been in Thailand. &quot;They did know, obviously,&quot; she says. &quot;But once I got there my tutor said, &apos;Let&apos;s just leave that behind&apos;.&quot; Now an articulate, enthusiastic and well-educated woman (with a 2:1 from Oxford and considerable teaching experience), it would seem that doors would open for her.  But, says Gregory, &quot;I sent 70 job application letters and got two interviews.&quot;  One of those interviews involved having a long chat with the managing director of a high-profile company, whereby she talked in detail about her experiences in Thailand. He told her she didn&apos;t have the job - but he had enjoyed hearing about what had happened to her. &quot;I honestly think he just enjoyed the gossip,&quot; she laughs.  Now Gregory works for Suma, the UK&apos;s largest independent wholefood wholesaler-distributor, based in West Yorkshire.  But her reputation preceded her. &quot;I know that when I got the job at Suma, some people weren&apos;t too happy about me joining and sent emails to that effect,&quot; she says. &quot;When I started, there was a fair bit of nudging and saying &apos;that&apos;s her&apos;. Sometimes people at work would say, &apos;I saw you on the telly,&apos; and I&apos;d think &apos;Yeah ... um you&apos;ll have to say something else too.&apos; I don&apos;t mind talking about it at all but I do mind if it doesn&apos;t have a purpose.&quot; Being part of a co-operative means Gregory is expected to be involved in all aspects of the company. &quot;We had the official photograph done about a year ago and I somehow didn&apos;t feel it was right to be in it. But ironically, I now work as a sales rep, representing the company with my face and name,&quot; she laughs. Gregory feels she is accepted now. But, she says: &quot;I did feel for ages that everyone hated me for what I had done. I don&apos;t think I could have worked harder but most people know me for who I am now. I would hope that people look at me and judge me by my performance.&quot; Rachel Brushfield, a career strategist who runs Energise Brand Communications, thinks the move might even be a positive one for Gregory&apos;s employers. &quot;Employing someone who has made a large and very public mistake and who demonstrates that they have learnt from it sends out a positive message to current employees and future talent. A company culture where considered and monitored risk, combined with good values and systems to support and monitor entrepreneurial spirit will help many companies thrive in the recession.&quot;  University lecturer Shaun Russell hit the headlines in 1996 when his wife and six-year-old daughter were murdered and his nine-year-old daughter Josie severely injured.  Russell says: &quot;We became the subject of intense media interest for several years, through the period when the attacker was being sought by police, his trial, appeal and re-trial and the inquiry into his prior treatment by the authorities. On the advice of police and lawyers I co-operated closely with the media, and Josie became something of a national &apos;celebrity&apos;.&quot;  Russell took six weeks off work while Josie recovered. He then returned part-time to his old job at the University of Kent. His colleagues, says Russell, treated him with &quot;great kindness, sympathy and generosity&quot;. But on occasion the pressure of that goodwill became too much.  Russell says: &quot;Sometimes I found myself having to &apos;support&apos; my more neurotic and overwrought colleagues, a couple of whom showed an irritating and sycophantic interest in mine and my daughter&apos;s experience and notoriety. People were uncertain about how to deal with me after the attacks. Some were worried that any expression of their sympathy would seem inadequate. Others were simply sensitive to the great pressures on me while I was trying to re-build mine and Josie&apos;s lives, as well as handling the intense public interest in the case.&quot; Russell eventually moved to north Wales and, after bit of contract work, took up a post at the University of Wales, Bangor. &quot;Due to the national profile and notoriety of our case, just about everybody knew about it,&quot; he says. &quot;It may have made it easier for me to get work, possibly because I was now better known and attracted a degree of sympathy. After a while, I found myself having again to relate my inside story to intrigued and fascinated - though generally sympathetic - colleagues.&quot;  Like Gregory, Russell worked harder in a bid to move on from the tragedy that had struck his family: &quot;My need to put the terrible events behind us led to me putting extra effort into rebuilding my career - such as working evenings, weekends and holidays on projects in order to compensate for time taken off to work with the police and the media. &quot;I doubled my efforts at work to deflect any possible criticism and, in fact, several of the contacts that Josie and I made through media exposure resulted in benefits for mine and my colleagues&apos; work, such as donations for research projects and student scholarships.&quot; Wolverhampton Nursery nurse Lisa Potts relinquished her anonymity in July 1996 when she dramatically saved the children in her care from an armed assailant. She was attacked with a machete and severely injured but won the George Medal - and several other awards - for her efforts. After the attack, Potts took six months off to recover. She returned to her old job but found it difficult.  &quot;The media interest was huge and the press [were] at the school a lot,&quot; says Potts. &quot;I had become a celebrity even though I hadn&apos;t asked to be one and that was really hard. I felt in a way I was hindering the school by being there.&quot; After writing her life story, publishing a children&apos;s prayer book and undertaking some speaking engagements, Potts decided to go back to college to study counselling and then applied for a job with a teenage pregnancy unit. &quot;That was pretty scary,&quot; she says. &quot;Where do you say you&apos;ve been for the last five years? What do you write in the box?&quot;  Shortly after, Potts married, moved house, went to work for Sure Start as a counsellor and set up her own children&apos;s charity, Believe 2 Achieve. &quot;Everybody was really quiet when I walked in and obviously they knew who I was,&quot; she says. &quot;Within a week I had no choice but to start talking about it and cracking jokes. Then it was OK, but for a while nobody knew what to say to me.&quot; But Potts says she got sick of always being known as &quot;the Machete Heroine&quot;.  &quot;I didn&apos;t want to be known by one moment of my life,&quot; she says. &quot;And that was hard to shake off.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-04-10T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Discrimination at work", "Work & careers", "Money"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/apr/11/discrimination-at-work-notorious", "title": "Hazel Davis talks to people with a notorious past who found redemption in the workplace", "sentences": ["Originally sentenced to 25 years in jail, she spent four years in Thailand&apos;s Lard Yao prison, known as the Bangkok Hilton, before being repatriated and pardoned by the king of Thailand in 2000."]}, {"article": "My parents made a startling contrast. My mother was Catholic, half Irish: emotional, sentimental, and fond of huge family gatherings. She also had a tendency to domestic improvisation, like sweeping the chimney in her underwear. My father was Scottish and scholarly, reticent, and determinedly atheist. He loathed showing emotion and hated any form of DIY. In our house someone once asked: &quot;Why are all your pictures hung so high?&quot; and my mother said: &quot;That&apos;s where the nails were.&quot;  I have elements of both parents in my own attitude, which is confusing. Hard work and integrity comes from Dad, although I can hardly claim to match him there; and from Mum come sentimentality, sociability, and a disastrous indi\ufb00erence to fashion. Sometimes I feel them warring within me: I start to prattle about feelings, or to tell a long, gossipy story and my inner Dad rolls his eyes up and sighs, and I stop.  I am one of four siblings \u2013 I am the only girl \u2013 and because my father had a diplomatic career we bounced around the world in a family bubble, engaging with foreign schools (mine were in Bangkok, Lille and South Africa) and then making long journeys back to boarding school. It makes you into a bit of a permanent outsider. I have quite surprised myself, settling down, but there is still an element in me that always expects to be uprooted.  My mother died in the summer, two years after our son Nicholas took his life. Both of these losses have made me even more aware of the need for memorials, which is why I am supporting the exhibition of memorial art and stonecarving at West Dean. My father&apos;s gravestone has the arms of St Andrew&apos;s University on it, as that time and his later studies in Freiburg before the war mattered deeply to him. Beneath it my mother&apos;s has the epitaph she wanted \u2013 or at least part of it. The text she suggested was: &quot;She had her faults, but she kept the feasts.&quot; My brothers and I decided to leave out the \ufb01rst \ufb01ve words. Shakespeare was wrong: your faults should die with you.  Nicholas&apos;s memorial stone is in our garden. It&apos;s a lovely piece: a porphyry rock, like a giant smooth pebble, with one of his poems carved on it. One nice thing is that friends bring small pebbles to put around it.  The great thing about family life is that you don&apos;t just learn from your parents, you learn just as much from your children. My daughter Rose is a marvellous comedy writer and performer and a blithe, brave spirit; Nicholas was a poet and also very funny.  As a family our ideals are old-fashioned.

Anti-government protesters stormed the interior ministry after the \u00adannouncement and mobbed what they thought was the car of Abhisit Vejjajiva, the prime minister. Forty-nine people were injured as troops fired into the air while clearing protesters loyal to the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra from a road junction. Earlier yesterday, he called for a \u00adrevolution and said he might return from overseas exile to lead it. &quot;Now that they have tanks on the streets, it is time for the people to come out in revolution. And when it is necessary, I will come back to the country,&quot; he said in a telephone message to followers who surrounded the prime&apos;s minister office. At least 20 intersections were occupied by red-shirted protesters, who swarmed over military vehicles and used buses to block several roads. Police said up to 30,000 demonstrators were scattered around Bangkok. An army spokesman, Colonel Sansern Kaewkamnerd, said soldiers and police were being moved to more than 50 points in the city, including bus and railway stations. The Foreign Office urged Britons planning to travel to Bangkok to &quot;urgently review their plans&quot; and warned visitors already there to stay indoors and avoid demonstrations. Abhisit&apos;s attempt to restore his rapidly eroding authority came a day after \u00adprotesters swarmed into a hotel hosting an Asian summit, forcing its cancellation and the region&apos;s leaders to flee. His decree bans gatherings of more than five people, forbids news reports considered threatening to public order and allows call up of troops to quell unrest. &quot;The government decided to impose the state of emergency because we want to return the country to normality,&quot; Abhisit said on national television. &quot;The government will try every way to prevent further damage. I ask the people to support the government in order to restore order in the country.&quot; Amid fears that the military was abandoning a weak government to its fate, the deputy prime minister, Suthep Thaugsuban, implored the security forces to do their job. &quot;Police and military officers must fully and forcefully carry out their jobs, lest more damage is done,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;Actions must be taken promptly and order be restored as soon as possible. Your superiors and I will take responsibility for all your actions.&quot; &quot;The situation has got completely out of hand,&quot; Charnvit Kasetsiri, a historian and former rector of Bangkok&apos;s Thammasat University, told the Associated Press. He said bloodshed was &quot;very much possible&quot; if Abhisit did not resign or dissolve parliament. &quot;If the government cannot control the situation, military intervention is not out of the question.&quot; Local media said Thaksin had asked his backers to &quot;swarm the summit venue&quot; \u2013 the Royal Cliff Beach hotel \u2013 and force Abhisit to step down. Thaksin, who was accused of corruption, was deposed in 2006 after a military coup. A deeply divisive figure, he is popular with the rural poor but is largely loathed by urban Thais. Abhisit came to power in December after political defections that the opposition said were stage-managed by the country&apos;s military. Thailand has had four prime ministers in 15 months, none of whom has been able to heal the country&apos;s political divisions. The latest factional violence follows warnings from some observers that the country is in danger of slipping into a &quot;mobocracy&quot;. Thailand&apos;s political crisis has been escalating since last year, amid deep disagreements over what the nature of the political system should be in the aftermath of the 2006 military coup, one of 18 that the country has witnessed. The country, which has been one of the worst hit in the region by the global economic meltdown, last year saw a two-month siege of Government House \u2013 the office of the prime minister \u2013 by yellow-clad supporters of the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy, who also closed two airports.

The red-shirted Thaksin demonstrators feel they were robbed of political power last December when Abhisit Vejjajiva became prime minister. They believe Abhisit, who is seen an ineffectual leader, only took office because the army engineered defections from the pro-Thaksin ruling party. How serious are the protests?Troops fired in the air early this morning to disperse crowds in the capital, Bangkok, and 70 people have been reported injured. The demonstrators humiliated the government when they &quot;swarmed&quot; into the venue of a regional summit at the weekend, forcing some of heads of state to flee by helicopter. Abhisit was forced to cancel the meeting that was supposed to discuss a regional response to the global financial crisis. That move did little for his waning authority or Thailand&apos;s international image. The latest unrest follows last year&apos;s protests by anti-Thaksin demonstrators \u2013 wearing yellow T-shirts \u2013 who occupied Bangkok international airport, stranding about 250,000 foreign tourists for a week. Thai officials warn that the latest unrest could cost the country&apos;s tourism industry billions of pounds and 200,000 jobs. Why the unrest?Thailand has been racked by instability ever since the 2006 coup \u2013 one of 18 revolutions the country has experienced. The coup deposed Thaksin, accusing him of corruption. A deeply divisive figure, the populist leader is well known in the UK for his brief ownership of Manchester City football club. He enjoys strong support from the rural poor but is largely loathed by urban Thais. Anti-Thaksin supporters, backed by the army, wanted a return to the status quo: a government that is pro-monarchy and looks after the interests of the urban elite rather than those of the countryside. The country is deeply divided and the country&apos;s politicians seem unable to bridge the gap. To add to Thailand&apos;s sense of uncertainty, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 82, who is revered by Thais, has been suffering ill health. Although the king holds no direct political power, uncertainty over the royal succession casts a shadow over Thailand&apos;s politics. What is Thaksin up to?Thaksin fled the country last year before a court convicted him in his absence of violating a conflict-of-interest law. In a telephoned message to his followers outside Abhisit&apos;s office, he said it was time for the &quot;people to come out in revolution&quot;. It was unclear from where Thaksin&apos;s call was made, but the former leader has been spending much of his time in Dubai. In an interview with the Far Eastern Economic Review magazine, he said the country was so divided because the country&apos;s elite did not like the fact that he was winning greater and greater support from the people. Will there be another military coup?After the coup in 2006, a cabinet of generals and their appointees governed the country for a year, but found little appetite to retain control because government is a difficult job. They would be reluctant to assume political power unless it is the only way to prevent the country into sliding into anarchy. In the past, King Bhumibol has exercised power behind the scenes to prevent the situation from boiling over. But the prolonged unrest provides stark evidence that the country&apos;s deep divisions may be beyond his influence.", "publicationDate": "2009-04-13T09:32:48Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Protest", "World news", "Travel", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/13/thailand-protests-thaksin-shinawatra", "title": "Trouble in Thailand: causes of the Bangkok riots", "sentences": ["How serious are the protests?Troops fired in the air early this morning to disperse crowds in the capital, Bangkok, and 70 people have been reported injured.", "The latest unrest follows last year&apos;s protests by anti-Thaksin demonstrators \u2013 wearing yellow T-shirts \u2013 who occupied Bangkok international airport, stranding about 250,000 foreign tourists for a week."]}, {"article": "Several years ago I interviewed an aide to the then prime minister of Thailand, Thaksin Shinawatra. I asked him what the government was doing to tackle corruption. &quot;The tricky thing about corruption,&quot; he said, &quot;is that some of the devils are also angels.&quot; Slightly bamboozled by this, I asked if he could give me some examples. &quot;Of course I can&apos;t,&quot; he smiled. &quot;Do you want to take my photo now?&quot; Last week the same aide popped up again, apparently masterminding the taxi roadblock that brought Bangkok to a halt.  Thai politics is confusing enough when it&apos;s peaceful. The events of recent months, with colour-coded armies staging demonstrations and occupations of increasing audacity, have made the whole thing seem even more bizarre. In very basic terms, those in the red shirts are supporters of Thaksin, with the bulk of them drawn from the rural poor in the north and north-east; the yellows are his opponents, mainly middle-class urbanites who supported the coup that ousted him in 2006. (Recent entrants to the melee are the blue shirts, who appear to be on the same side as the yellows, but are considerably less posh.) The problem for the yellows is that every time there&apos;s been an election since 2001, Thaksin or those associated with him have had the temerity to win it. The current premier, Abhisit Vejjajiva, is only in office because of the yellow-shirt occupation late last year that shut down the country&apos;s main airport, keeping hundreds of foreign holidaymakers in limbo for days. Protesters refused to leave until the then PM, Somchai Wongsawat \u2013 Thaksin&apos;s brother-in-law \u2013 stood down. This weekend, the red shirts had their revenge by storming the hotel hosting the Asean summit in Pattaya and forcing its cancellation.  While there have been injuries and even deaths as a result of the confrontations over the last few months, it&apos;s this succession of PR disasters that threatens to cause the greatest damage to the country. The airport blockade dealt a vicious blow to the tourist industry (which accounts for 6% of GDP) which had picked up after reverses caused by SARS, bird flu and the 2004 tsunami. For one night in November, one of the most prestigious hotels in Bangkok had precisely two rooms occupied. And now the sight of foreign delegates being airlifted to safety is unlikely to boost already shaky regional trade links. Thailand has suffered more than its neighbours from the global economic downturn; unlikely as it may seem, somewhere like Vietnam (let&apos;s not forget, still nominally a Communist state) now appears to many foreign investors to be a safer bet. For all the bluster about their own selfless patriotism, it&apos;s as if the rival groups are competing to see who can deposit the biggest turd on the country&apos;s doorstep.

It wonders whether the prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, is up to the crisis.  Actually, who is in charge? Abhisit is PM by name, but can&apos;t get the police or military to do what he wants (yet). Abhisit looks impotent and, well the ball is in his court.  Nirmal Ghosh was live blogging from the protests for the Straits Times, a Malaysian newspaper.  The soldiers have so far been quite disciplined in pushing back the red shirts, firing only into the air. Government spokesman Panitan Wattanayagorn said on TV that the security forces have the situation under control and will make sure that the safety of foreigners is not threatened. He also said that the military will this afternoon secure key locations such as airports and ports to prevent any further danger to the country.  As Thai forces move to retake control of the streets of Bangkok from anti-government supporters, an editorial in the Bangkok Post, headlined &quot;It&apos;s Time to Draw the Line&quot;, condemns the red-shirted followers of the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a coup in 2006.  For the rioters and their inflamed emotions, democracy is obviously intended to mean they have the right to have it all their way once they can amass enough people to create a viable threat to law and order. All of this and the fact that deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra still felt it necessary after the weekend&apos;s fiasco to phone in to encourage even more people to take to the streets means there is no option but for armoured personnel carriers and heavily armed troops on the streets of the capital.  The Nation newspaper was similarly aghast at the behaviour of the Thaksin supporters in wrecking a regional summit at the weekend.  Are they insane? They have completely wrecked not only the country&apos;s reputation, but further endangered Thai democracy. Abhisit was right in declaring them the enemies of Thailand. He must be bolder and firmer in restoring law and order from now on. Sadly, these red-shirt leaders failed to realise that apart from the broken glass, they had also caused damage to not just Thailand but also any regional efforts to join forces and solve problems for their people. It shows that Thaksin&apos;s supporters very unwisely chose to fight for one person&apos;s personal issues instead of keeping the country&apos;s interests in mind.  The Far Eastern Economic Review magazine carries a recent interview with Thaksin, who has called for a &quot;revolution&quot; from his supporters. He is still nursing a grudge against those who drove him out of power in 2006. Asked why he thinks the country is so divided, Thaksin says:  After they ousted me, it hurt the whole country. Because I keep winning, with more and more majorities, so some elite groups may not be comfortable about my political power, because of the backing of the people.

This is not the case. What we have been seeing in Thailand since late 2005 is a growing class war between the poor and the old elites. It is, of course, not a pure class war. Due to a vacuum on the left in the past, millionaire and populist politicians like Thaksin Shinawatra have managed to provide leadership to the poor.  The urban and rural poor, who form the majority of the electorate, are the Red Shirts. They want the right to choose a democratically elected government. They started out as passive supporters of Thaksin&apos;s Thai Rak Thai government, but have since formed a new citizens&apos; movement they call Real Democracy.  For them, Real Democracy means an end to the long-accepted quiet dictatorship of the army generals and the palace. This situation allowed the generals, the king&apos;s advisors in the privy council and the conservative elites to behave as though they were above the constitution. Since 2006, these elites have blatantly acted against election results by staging a military coup, using the courts to twice dissolve Thaksin&apos;s party and by backing Yellow Shirt royalist mob violence on the streets.  The present Democrat party government was manoeuvred into place by the army. Most of those in the Red Shirt movement support Thaksin, and with good reason. His government put in place many modern pro-poor policies, including Thailand&apos;s first universal healthcare system. Yet the Red Shirts are not merely Thaksin puppets. They are self-organised in community groups, and some are showing frustration with Thaksin&apos;s lack of progressive leadership, especially over his insistence that they be &quot;loyal&quot; to the crown.  A republican movement is growing. Many left-leaning Thais, like myself, are not Thaksin supporters. We opposed his human rights abuses. But we are with the citizens&apos; movement for Real Democracy. The Yellow Shirts are conservative royalists. Some have fascist tendencies. Their guards carry and use firearms. They supported the 2006 coup, wrecked Government House and blocked the international airports last year. Behind them were the army. That is why troops never shot at the Yellow Shirts. That is why the present, Oxford-educated, Thai prime minister has done nothing to punish the Yellow Shirts. After all, he appointed some to his cabinet. The aims of the Yellow Shirts are to reduce the voting power of the electorate in order to protect the conservative elites and the &quot;bad old ways&quot; of running Thailand. They propose a &quot;new order&quot; dictatorship where people can vote, but most MPs and public positions are not up for election. They are supported by the mainstream Thai media, most middle class academics and even NGO leaders. If one is to understand and judge the violent acts taking place in Thailand, we need a sense of history and perspective. Perspective is needed to distinguish between damaging property and injuring or killing people. A sense of history helps to explain why Red Shirt citizens are now exploding in anger. They have had to endure the military jackboot, repeated theft of their democratic rights, continued acts of violence against them and general abuse from the mainstream media and academia. The stakes are very high. Any compromise has the risk of instability. The old elites might want to do a deal with Thaksin to stop the Red Shirts from becoming totally republican. But whatever happens, Thai society cannot go back to the old days. The Red Shirts represent millions of Thais who are sick and tired of military and palace intervention in politics. At the very least they will want a non-political constitutional monarchy.

Thai officials said the deaths came during a gun battle between residents and hundreds of red-shirted anti-government protesters who were pushed back by thousands of troops firing warning shots and tear gas. The shootings followed a day of running street battles in the city that left at least 110 people injured, following a night in which soldiers were reported to have fired into a crowd. An army spokesman said that, by mid-afternoon yesterday, its troops, had cleared protesters from several key areas including the Victory Monument and two major road junctions. &quot;The shots fired into the crowd were blank bullets,&quot; he said. &quot;The heads are made of paper, so it only causes sound. We use these when protesters head toward soldiers to push them back. Those fired into the air are real bullets.&quot; There were at least three other clashes with residents as protesters were pushed back. In a mostly Muslim neighbourhood, hundreds of demonstrators threw objects at residents, burnt tyres, went into the mosque and tried to set fire to some food stalls. Last night, soldiers advanced into an area held by an estimated 5,000 protesters near Government House \u2013 the prime minister&apos;s office \u2013 in what appeared to be a final push to end the demonstrations that have badly tarnished the country&apos;s reputation and deepened its political turmoil. &quot;This will be our final stand. I beg that you return here and face them together,&quot; Jatuporn Phromphan, a protest leader, shouted from a platform. &quot;We will use peaceful means and stay right here to end their violence.&quot; The prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, expressed confidence that the government would restore order. &quot;We are confident that we are in control of the situation,&quot; he told the BBC. In an earlier TV appearance, Abhisit urged people to leave the area and guaranteed their safety. But the exiled former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, the figurehead of the protests, claimed a number of people had been killed by government forces. &quot;Many people are dying. They even take the bodies on the military trucks and take them away,&quot; he said. In the course of the protests, fires blazed in the street and plumes of smoke rose from burning cars and tyres during standoffs between troops and protesters, who commandeered about 30 buses to block military vehicles.

Think about your country.&quot; Police on motorbikes shuttled between troops and demonstrators to mediate. Elsewhere, about 100 women protesters knelt down in front of hundreds of soldiers and police and screamed. &quot;Please stop, brothers.&quot; Some hugged the soldiers. The first and most serious clash began at about 4am local time when troops in full combat gear advanced to disperse the protesters. The soldiers reportedly fired hundreds of rounds from their M16 automatic rifles over the heads of the demonstrators. Protesters threw at least one petrol bomb, which exploded behind the army line as teargas hung in the air. At the nearby Century Park hotel, foreign tourists were seen rushing into taxis and heading for Bangkok&apos;s international airport. The clashes marked a major escalation in the anti-government unrest. Yesterday, protesters smashed cars carrying the prime minister and his aides. The secretary general of Abhisit&apos;s office, Niphon Promphan, was dragged from the car and beaten, suffering head injuries and broken ribs. The head of Thailand&apos;s armed forces, General Songkitti Jaggabatara, said soldiers would use &quot;every means to end the chaos&quot; but employ weapons only for &quot;self-defence and to avoid excessive force&quot;. The chaotic scenes from Bangkok threaten to further damage an economy already reeling from the combined effects of prolonged political instability and the global financial crisis. There were particular fears that tourism, a big earner of foreign exchange, would be badly hit. he local Bangkok&apos;s city government cancelled all its festivities to mark today&apos;s start of the Thai new year, normally the country&apos;s most festive holiday. Countries including Britain, France and the US have urged their citizens to avoid trips to Thailand, and advised those already in Bangkok to stay in their hotels and away from protests. But regional experts predicted that the turmoil would continue for some time to come. &quot;I believe the darkest days in Thailand&apos;s history are yet to come, as we see no swift solution to ongoing divisiveness,&quot; said Prinn Panitchpakdi, an Asia-Pacific analyst. Abhisit declared a state of emergency in Bangkok yesterday after supporters of Thaksin , who was deposed in a military coup in 2006, forced the cancellation of an Asian summit in the southern resort of Pattaya. Thaksin&apos;s supporters say Abhisit became prime minister last December only because of parliamentary defections that the military engineered. Thaksin&apos;s backers want new elections, which they think they are well-placed to win. The populist former prime minister fled the country last year before a court convicted him in his absence of violating a conflict-of-interest law. He has said that &quot;it is time for the people to come out in revolution.&quot; A deeply divisive figure, Thaksin is popular with the rural poor but is largely loathed by urban Thais. Thailand has had four prime ministers in the past 15 months, none of whom has been able to heal the country&apos;s political divisions. The latest factional violence \u00adfollows warnings from some observers that the country is in danger of slipping into a &quot;mobocracy&quot;.

The country, which has been one of the worst hit in the region by the global economic meltdownThailand last year saw a two-month siege of Government House \u2013 the office of the prime minister \u2013 by yellow-clad supporters of the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy, who also closed two airports, stranding hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists.", "publicationDate": "2009-04-13T16:48:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Travel", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/13/thailand-bangkok-protests", "title": "Two demonstrators killed as Thailand troops bid to end Bangkok unrest", "sentences": ["Mark Tran and agencies Bangkok Two people were killed yesterday as troops closed in on thousands of protesters who have vowed to make a &quot;last stand&quot; in the Thai capital, Bangkok.....

The military has taken over 18 times since the country became a constitutional monarchy in 1932. Bangkok&apos;s colour-coded street activists \u2013 the Reds, Yellows and Blues \u2013 recall the rival chariot-racing factions of ancient Rome&apos;s Circus Maximus. Except in these troubled times, Thailand makes even Italy look like a model of democratic stability. Abhisit Vejjajiva is Thailand&apos;s third prime minister in almost as many months and lacks both electoral legitimacy and grassroots credibility. An Eton- and Oxford-educated Geordie (he was brought up in Newcastle-upon-Tyne), Abhisit always seemed an odd choice for national crisis manager, ever since being picked in a backroom deal in December. Now that he has invited soldiers on to the streets, he may encounter difficulty persuading them to go back to barracks. In Thailand the army is rarely far away. The military has not convincingly relinquished control since trashing the elected government of Thaksin Shinawatra in a September 2006 coup. All Thailand&apos;s current political travails stem from that moment. As ever, the generals claimed to be acting in the nation&apos;s best interests. As usual, they bit off more than they could chew. In reality, theirs was a sectional concern; and its impact was divisive, not unifying. The temporary, deceptive calm they imposed was quickly overwhelmed by tidal waves of popular anger, with the left, right and centre, the middle and lower classes, the well-off and the poor taking tumultuous turns to vent their spleen on whoever was nominally in charge.  Thaksin the exiled billionaire remains a controversial and central figure. His family&apos;s business dealings provoked numerous allegations of corruption while he was in power. His often tacky, populist politics and cash giveaways to the rural poor in the north and east brought accusations of vote-buying. His handling of the long-simmering Muslim insurgency in the south was at times clumsy and provocative. But Thaksin did possess one virtue: he was elected, and then re-elected, by democratic margins big enough to outweigh the usual opposition claims of fraud and malpractice. He had a legitimate base. He held the country together, a feat now more easily appreciated as it tears itself apart. And he briefly enhanced Thailand&apos;s international standing, in sharp contrast to the weekend&apos;s national humiliation that saw the leaders of Asia scrambling hastily for the exit as pro-Thaksin demonstrators stormed their regional summit meeting in the beach resort of Pattaya. The normally soft-spoken Abhisit was beside himself with rage and declared a state of emergency in the capital. &quot;On the country&apos;s loss today, whoever declares this as victory, I will treat them as national enemies. I will do whatever I can to make sure these people cannot stay above the law,&quot; he said. This did not sound like a man ready to pursue the process of national reconciliation that Thailand so badly needs after three bruising years. What it did sound like was a man who may need the army, and the paramilitary Blues faction, if he is to hold on to power. Whether Thaksin could do any better at bringing the country together and restoring democratic and judicial standards is also far from clear. He appears to have played a significant role from afar in fomenting the latest crisis, which followed last autumn&apos;s resurgence of his main rivals, the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy, aka the Yellows, and December&apos;s banning of the pro-Thaksin People Power Party, aka the Reds. It was Thaksin who set a deadline last week, ignored by the government, for the calling of fresh elections. It is Thaksin who has been urging Thais to pursue a &quot;peaceful revolution&quot;, vowing yesterday that there could no peace without justice. And it is Thaksin who has carefully refused to rule out a return to his native soil, despite extant warrants for his arrest. &quot;If our people in Bangkok and all the provinces unite ... I think this time we can change the country,&quot; he said. The prospect of the former prime minister&apos;s return to power gladdens the hearts of half the country and utterly appals the other half. It is this possibility that could lead, more than any other single factor, to another military coup to forestall him. But while Thailand is a land of rage, it is also the land of the deal. The crisis is costing it dear, exacerbated by global recession. The IMF says the economy may contract by 4% this year. The markets are down, tourism is slumping and business is bad. As in the past, a national accommodation is possible; as of now, it is plainly in the common interest. Thailand&apos;s political tsunami may subside as quickly as it erupted \u2013 but only if the generals can be kept locked in their box.", "publicationDate": "2009-04-13T17:00:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Thaksin Shinawatra", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/13/thailand1", "title": "Simon Tisdall: The prospect of Thaksin's return would be  would be the most likely cause of a military coup in Thailand", "sentences": ["Bangkok&apos;s colour-coded street activists \u2013 the Reds, Yellows and Blues \u2013 recall the rival chariot-racing factions of ancient Rome&apos;s Circus Maximus.", "&quot;If our people in Bangkok and all the provinces unite ..."]}, {"article": "Anti-government protesters in Bangkok were surrounded by hundreds of troops, armoured personnel carriers and barbed wire barricades last night as an uneasy calm settled on the Thai capital after two people died in increasingly violent clashes between the two sides. With the city under a state of emergency and thousands of supporters of the ousted former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra still concentrated around Government House, many tourists followed their embassy&apos;s advice to flee Bangkok. Thai troops had used teargas, water cannon and volleys of semi-automatic warning shots throughout the day in an attempt to take control. At least 113 people were injured as mobs of Thaksin supporters wearing red shirts resisted attempts by troops to clear them from the streets by setting fire to barricades of tyres, lobbing at least one Molotov cocktail, and directing a blazing bus towards the ranks of soldiers. Inside the military cordon, about 3,000 or 4,000 anti-government supporters had erected basic barricades made from wooden stages and congregated around Government House, listening to speeches through the night. Some carried Molotov cocktails, and a smell of petrol hung in the air. One of the demonstrators, a cosmetics seller who gave her name as Anne, said: &quot;Tonight, we all fear we will die. The soldiers have guns and bombs, they want to kill us. I have seen them kill someone.&quot; Another showed his slingshot and said he expected the soldiers to come soon, adding that the outside world did not understand the reasons for the protests. &quot;We don&apos;t care about Thaksin. We just want democracy, we&apos;ve never had it in Thailand.&quot; Thaksin, who was accused of corruption, was ousted in 2006 after a military coup, the 18th in the historically shaky semi-democracy. He remains a divisive figure, accused of corruption by urban Thais, but widely supported by the rural poor. Abhisit Vejjajiva, an Oxford-educated economist, became prime minister in December after a court ordered the removal of the previous pro-Thaksin government, citing electoral fraud, but Abhisit has faced growing protests. The government was humiliated at the weekend when Thaksin supporters smashed their way into a summit of south-east Asian leaders in the resort of Pattaya, forcing the evacuation of regional dignitaries by helicopter. Abhisit declared a state of emergency. In a nationwide broadcast yesterday, he appealed to the demonstrators to go home, saying the government was using &quot;the softest measures possible&quot; to restore calm. &quot;All the work I am doing is not to create fear or put pressure or to harm any group of people. It&apos;s a step by step process to restore order and stop violence,&quot; he said in an interview broadcast on national television. But Abhisit&apos;s authority is in tatters. He is unable to commute to his own office because it is blockaded by a ring of several thousand protesters. At the weekend, his car was attacked by a mob wielding wooden staves. A senior aide suffered head injuries and broken ribs. Early yesterday, troops moved to regain control. Before dawn, dozens of soldiers carrying riot shields and automatic weapons attempted to regain control of the Din Daeng intersection, a key point in the city&apos;s traffic system. The protesters responded by threatening to set fire to a fuel tanker blocking the road outside an apartment block. Residents with sticks and metal poles then rushed out to defend their homes, prompting an angry three-way standoff. Around the Victory Monument soldiers sprayed hundreds of M16 rounds into the air and fired water cannon at the demonstrators. The protesters set fire to an empty bus, jammed down the accelerator with a bag of water bottles, and directed it towards a line of advancing troops. An army spokesman, Colonel Sansern Kaewkamnerd, claimed the protesters had used teargas, and &quot;weapons&quot; to open fire on the soldiers. Anti-government leaders have told supporters to regroup at Government House, which they have surrounded for three weeks. Other members of their movement, the United Front of Democracy against Dictatorship, claimed the government had held a &quot;war room meeting&quot; at which it was decided to try to cut off the food and water of the demonstrators, and to arm police with pistols. The Thai media have also reported counter-attacks by blue-shirted supporters of the &quot;establishment&quot;, thought to be a reference to the Thai royal family. In an internet address to supporters on Sunday night, Thaksin called for a revolution that would allow him to return. &quot;Now that they have tanks on the streets, it is time for the people to come out in revolution. And when it is necessary, I will come back to the country,&quot; he said in a video link projected on giant screens.

The drama seemed almost ritualistic - an airport siege where protesters apologised to tourists for inconveniencing them. No longer. Thailand&apos;s frightening political collapse, from emerging tolerant democracy to dysfunctional oligarchy, has reached a darker, threatening stage. On Saturday protesters stormed a regional summit in the resort of Pattaya. Leaders, including China&apos;s prime minister, Wen Jiabao, had to be evacuated.

Only two people, at the time of writing, appear to have been killed, but many have been injured. The damage to Thailand&apos;s reputation and economy is huge. The country is being ripped apart by a political crisis which each day gets further from resolution. Voices are getting shriller and the government weaker. Revolution, or another military takeover, are beginning to look unavoidable. Thailand should not be in this crisis and all sides share responsibility for bringing it about. The country is not split by ethnic or religious dispute, although conflict in the partly Muslim south has been exacerbated by events in Bangkok. Despite repeated coups, and a political monarchy, Thailand had built a democratic culture, which should have been strong enough to survive corruption and recession. But it is failing in the face of manipulative politicians and a public whose rage is being fired by a justified sense of exploitation and injustice. Yesterday should have been joyful, the Songkran water festival, where Thais soak each other and tourists. Instead red-clad protesters were chased through the streets of Bangkok by forces supporting the unelected prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, who himself now seems caught between the forces of revolt and reaction. He has the support of urban Thais - some of them middle-class democrats - as well as murkier backers in the military and the right. He came to power on the back of the yellow-shirted protests which paralysed Bangkok last year, and brought down an elected government backed by the exiled former leader Thaksin Shinawatra, who is now calling for revolution. A democratic contest would go in Thaksin&apos;s favour, which is why the urban elite want to deny him one. He has the loyalty of the rural poor.

The country is in the grip of its worst recession since the Asian financial crisis 11 years ago, and the political instability of recent months has made the situation worse. The cancellation of the 16-nation summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, due to take place in Thailand at the weekend, was another embarrassment for the Thai government. Thailand&apos;s finance minister, Korn Chatikavanij, told Bloomberg television today that the government would cut its GDP forecast once again. Last week he predicted the economy would shrink by up to 3% this year after a slump in exports, which make up 70% of GDP. Rating agencies Moody&apos;s, Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s and Fitch, which already have a negative outlook for Thailand, have warned that the country&apos;s sovereign ratings could be downgraded further if unrest persists, hitting domestic and foreign investment. Kim Eng Tan, an analyst at S&amp;P, said: &quot;It could lead to increased investment outflow out of Thailand. Tourism can rebound, but investor confidence will be very hard to get back.&quot; Bank of Thailand governor, Tarisa Watanagase, also warned of the economic impact of the recent clashes. She said: &quot;Confidence is crucial to economic recovery. So, I hope everybody will co-operate to solve the economic problem.&quot; The violence has dealt another blow to Thailand&apos;s crucial tourism industry. It had just started to pick up again after protests last November led to Bangkok&apos;s airports being shut for one week. Several countries, including Britain, have urged their citizens to avoid trips to Thailand and those already in Bangkok to stay in their hotels and away from the clashes. The UK government&apos;s warning stayed in force this morning even as the latest protests wound down. Protesters ended a three-week siege of the prime minister&apos;s office today, although they vowed to return. Analysts said that even if the violence subsides, deep divisions in the country remain. &quot;The underlying problem of discord between the urban elite and the rural population remains in place, and a clear-cut solution does not seem anywhere close at the moment,&quot; said analysts at Japanese investment bank Nomura. Kongkrit Hiranyakit, chairman of the Tourism Council of Thailand, said the violence between protesters and security forces in the past few months, including November&apos;s airport shutdown, was likely to slash tourism revenues by a third this year, or 200bn baht (\u00a33.8bn). About 200,000 jobs could be lost in tourism, which directly employs about 2 million people. Chatikavanij said the government would go ahead with its spending plans. Thailand plans to spend 1.57 trillion baht (\u00a330bn) over three years, mainly on infrastructure projects, to help create jobs and kick-start the economy. This comes on top of an earlier 116.7bn baht (\u00a32.2bn) stimulus package of public works, training programmes, cash handouts and tax breaks. Financial markets remained closed today for the Thai new year holiday. They had been due to reopen on Thursday but the government extended the holiday until the weekend. Credit Suisse has recommended that investors take profits on Thai stocks following gains in the past month. Thailand&apos;s currency could be less affected by the unrest because it has already fallen sharply, by 1.8% in the past three months.", "publicationDate": "2009-04-14T08:30:19Z", "tags": ["Global economy", "Thailand", "World news", "Protest", "Global recession", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/apr/14/thailand-economy-recession-economy-exports", "title": "Anti-government protests spark fears over Thailand's economy", "sentences": ["It had just started to pick up again after protests last November led to Bangkok&apos;s airports being shut for one week.", "Several countries, including Britain, have urged their citizens to avoid trips to Thailand and those already in Bangkok to stay in their hotels and away from the clashes."]}, {"article": "     Thai police have issued arrest warrants for 14 anti-government protest leaders, including the exiled former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, whose supporters have been behind the demonstrations. The warrants followed the capitulation of the protesters in Bangkok today, ending a bloody three-week period of unrest with a plume of black smoke, a cascade of water and a promise to return to the streets unless Thailand&apos;s political system was reformed. About 3,000 demonstrators, many in tears, retreated from Government House and four leaders handed themselves into the police as hundreds of armed troops surrounded their last stronghold. Thaksin&apos;s ousting as PM has been at the heart of three years of political turmoil. The arrest warrants cited the protest leaders for creating a public disturbance and illegal assembly, which carry prison terms of up to seven and three years respectively.

They set fire to two buses, ignited gas canisters and hosed the streets with water from a stolen fire engine, but there was no direct conflict with soldiers massed behind armoured personnel carriers and armed with M16 rifles and percussion grenades. &quot;This is not the end.

The clashes have revealed the dangerous division in Thai society between a rich urban elite and poor migrants and farmers.

Last week, the red shirts seized key traffic intersections in the Thai capital, forced the cancellation of the Asean summit in Pattaya and prompted the government to declare a state of emergency. Rival yellow and blue-shirted mobs, which support the government, have launched vigilante attacks, particularly on taxi drivers who are seen as a support base for the reds.

In an unprecedented attack on global drugs policy, Michele Kazatchkine, head of the influential Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, has told the Observer that, without a radical overhaul of laws that lead to hundreds of thousands of drug users being imprisoned or denied access to safe treatment, the millions of pounds spent on fighting HIV and Aids will be wasted. Kazatchkine will use his keynote speech at the 20th International Harm Reduction Association conference tomorrow in Bangkok to expose the failures of policies which treat addiction as a crime. He will accuse governments of using what he calls &quot;repressive&quot; measures that deny addicts human rights rather than putting public health needs first.  He will argue that governments should fully commit to the widespread provision of harm reduction strategies aimed at intravenous drug users, such as free needle exchanges and providing substitutes to illicit drugs, such as methadone. &quot;A repressive way of dealing with drug users is a way of facilitating the spread of the [HIV/Aids] epidemic,&quot; Kazatchkine said. &quot;If you know you will be arrested, you will not go for treatment. I say drug use cannot be criminalised. I&apos;m talking about criminalising trafficking but not users. From a scientific perspective, I cannot understand the repressive policy perspective.&quot; He condemns policymakers who argue that, because drug users frequently turn to crime to fund their habit, it justifies making it a criminal justice issue. Harm reduction both helps the addict and wider society and reduces the need to commit crime, he said.  &quot;The one population where [Aids] mortality has been untouched - and in fact has worsened - has been IV [intravenous] drug users. It&apos;s amazing, because what we call harm reduction, such as exchanging needles, has been scientifically proven as the most effective. &quot;This is why I will most probably start my speech in Bangkok by mentioning the contrast between major progress achieved in decreasing mortality from Aids in the poorest countries of the world versus the total lack of progress for what is the main route of transmission in most parts of the world outside Africa.&quot; Kazatchkine suggested that politicians feared that the public would label them soft on drugs. A doctor and respected Aids expert with 20 years in the field, he has in his two years at the helm of the Global Fund overseen some of the most dramatic improvements in treatment and prevention of HIV globally.  Since it was established in 2001, the fund has received $21bn in contributions from the world&apos;s wealthiest nations and used it to play a significant part in reducing rates of new HIV infections. It has also contributed to the distribution of much needed life-preserving anti-retroviral drugs to millions of people already diagnosed. Alex Stevens, a senior research fellow specialising in drugs and criminalisation at the University of Kent, said tomorrow&apos;s speech would highlight many of the troubling consequences of criminal justice approaches to drugs policy. &quot;In many countries, serious human rights infringements are committed in the name of fighting drugs,&quot; he said. &quot;These include the use of the death penalty for drug offences, compulsory treatment regimes that include methods (such as physical beatings) that are akin to torture, and, for example in the USA, depriving convicted drug law offenders of the right to vote.&quot; Stevens said that, while the UK was ahead of many other countries on harm reduction, its tendency to criminalise drug users could undermine its efforts.

After minimal treatment these individuals awoke and staggered off, back to their next hit, hoping it wasn&apos;t going to be their last. Some of them ended up in the morgue. I suppose that I arrested as many &apos;druggies&apos; as anybody else on the team and the thumbnail of cannabis found in the bottom of their pockets found its way onto the charge sheet as a matter of routine. Sometimes triumphant detectives came back to the police station with a few pot plants they had found on some hippy&apos;s window ledge. After a few weeks of healthy, well-watered growth on the crime squad&apos;s own window sill, this now very impressive evidence arrived on the window sill (well, evidence bench) of the magistrates court. I don&apos;t remember many middle class visitors to the charge room, although their children did pop in from time to time with small offerings of cannabis. This imbalance in enforcement was an obvious result of the fact that officers usually patrol the streets, not the post-prandial drawing rooms or VIP areas of the drug taking elite. I commanded or oversaw many anti-drug operations. In one central London council estate we arrested nearly 30 street dealers in a co-ordinated swoop. It was a very professionally executed operation, a credit to the efforts of all those involved and motivated by a desire to tackle overt street dealing in heroin and crack cocaine. Some undercover officers put themselves at risk as they immersed themselves in the addicts&apos; lifestyle (showers not an option) and became accepted by the dealers. Others were at risk of falling off ladders as they assumed the role of observant decorators. The evidence was so good that all those arrested pleaded guilty. And one building ended up with five coats of paint. A much bigger operation in an East Anglian city successfully targeted more than 100 street dealers. It was hailed as a great success by local and national politicians, much as any large seizure of drugs, or police &quot;crackdown&quot;, is celebrated as evidence of the success of the &quot;war on drugs&quot;. If success were measured by the volume of arrests and drugs seized you could conclude that the police service had done well; however, judged on success in containing the market and reducing harm, the outcome is quite different. It wasn&apos;t that I experienced a single apocalyptic moment that the war on drugs was a disaster, but during over thirty years of police service I came to realise that what we were doing was very expensive, ineffective and even counter-productive. Nowhere in the country is free from drugs and the associated crime epidemic. Criminals continue to make huge profits, corroding and corrupting public and private lives. They target each new generation of children and create addicts who are ostracised, become diseased and die unnecessarily. It all seemed so pointless; what were we achieving? The enthusiastically spun revolving door of criminal justice took in and spat out drug dealers, often addicts themselves, to deal again. Young men and women, arrested for little more than youthful experimentation emerged with their young lives forever tainted with a criminal conviction. If your child was arrested for drug possession would you want them to be prosecuted and convicted or guided, supported and, if necessary, treated? A different approach in that same East Anglian city offered a choice between treatment and arrest to prolifically offending addicts. They almost invariably chose treatment, and the detectives on the team were surprised to learn that not only did this save time and precious resources, but it was also the most effective way for tackling burglary they had ever seen. We thought and acted in new ways and achieved better results, for everybody. Prosecuting users is misguided and counter productive; prosecuting dealers without tackling demand or their profits doesn&apos;t work. The criminals make about \u00a36 billion a year while the criminal justice system spends over \u00a310 billion a year. If the money wasted on misinformation, enforcement and condemnation had been spent on tackling the underlying causes, so many lives blighted by drugs and crime could have been different. There are a number of alternative methods available, but sadly we can&apos;t hold a rational public debate as serving officers or politicians who dare challenge the &quot;war on drugs&quot; orthodoxy justifiably fear being pilloried by our national press. We need a comprehensive overhaul of our enforcement practices, encouraging partnership, avoiding the false tension between enforcement and harm reduction, and looking for effective deployment of resources directed towards achieving new, realistic, objectives \u2013 not some pie in the sky dream of a drug free society. \u2022 Tom Lloyd began his police career in 1974 and retired as a chief constable in 2005.

It was his and City&apos;s great fortune to be picked up last August by Sheikh Mansour, who, having spent more than \u00a3300m already, is intent on demonstrating the art of being a good billionaire. The rhetoric of Sulaiman Al Fahim, the takeover&apos;s original front man, who talked of &quot;very deep pockets&quot; to buy Cristiano Ronaldo and a sticker-book of other gal\u00e1cticos, alarmed Mansour by setting exactly the wrong, wad-waving tone and Al Fahim was quickly removed. Club insiders accept ruefully that January&apos;s Kaka bid, and its unseemly collapse, seemed to confirm that loadsamoney impression. Yet they insist that Mansour and his chairman, Khaldoon Al Mubarak, chairman of the Abu Dhabi government&apos;s Executive Affairs Authority and one of the emirate&apos;s highest-flying executives, are setting out a 10-year plan for City based on solid foundations, without hollowing out the soul of the club. Attention has focused obsessively recently on Mark Hughes&apos;s security as City&apos;s manager, and his position will be reviewed in the summer, but the owners point to wider investment in the club designed to support him. After Mansour bought City from Thaksin for a reported \u00a3210m including debts, Khaldoon, on his first visit, found the gym at the Carrington training ground seriously inadequate. The medical centre was described by one insider as &quot;like the treatment room in M*A*S*H&quot;. Robinho was signed for \u00a332.5m as part of the takeover deal, and the source reflected: &quot;We had Robinho but no decent gym.&quot; Khaldoon, on that visit, ordered a world-class gym and medical centre to be built. Thaksin, hailed by the majority of City fans when he took over in June 2007, was supposed to be the billionaire to convert blue moon to gold. He was welcomed despite long-standing human rights allegations against him when he was prime minister of Thailand, corruption charges and \u00a3800m of assets frozen under the military government which overthrew him. City were sold to him because the former major shareholders, John Wardle and David Makin, could not fund them any further, but the accounts, covering the year to 31 May 2008, show City lost \u00a333m up to then under Thaksin, and their bank borrowings increased from \u00a349m to \u00a364m. The amount owed to all creditors ballooned from \u00a3134m to \u00a3209m. Yet still a further \u00a349.5m was spent last summer, including \u00a319m on Jo, bought from CSKA Moscow. Few at City doubt that Thaksin used the club to boost his own standing in Thailand. Thai dignitaries were entertained at matches and the City team taken on a tour of the country \u2013 for which, the accounts show, \u00a347,912 was paid for PR services to a company owned by Thaksin&apos;s son, Panthongtae Shinawatra. Thaksin&apos;s own total contribution has been itemised: \u00a317.5m to pay off Wardle and Makin&apos;s \u00a320m loans, and he also lent the club \u00a321m, at annual interest rates of up to 11.83%. In August last year, Thaksin&apos;s wife, Pojaman, was sentenced to three years in prison for evading millions of pounds of tax in connection with a 1997 shares transfer deal. The couple skipped bail, fleeing to Britain after attending the Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing. City, by then, had borrowed a further \u00a325m from Standard Bank, and it emerged that Wardle had on three occasions lent the club \u00a32m to tide it over cash-flow difficulties. In October 2008 in his absence, Thaksin was sentenced to two years in prison by Thailand&apos;s supreme court for having in 2003 abused his authority as prime minister to facilitate Pojaman&apos;s purchase of land in Bangkok. A month later, the government here barred him from entering the UK as &quot;not a desirable person&quot;. In February City removed him from the position of honorary president which had been agreed when he sold up. Mansour has, it is understood, paid off Thaksin&apos;s loans and the bank debts, although he has made his investment by loans of his own. More recently the club appointed a senior team to work with the chief executive, Garry Cook, including the former Arsenal winger Brian Marwood, lately head of Nike&apos;s UK football operation, as a football administrator, a technical role and link between Hughes and Jim Cassell&apos;s flourishing academy. Kaka apart, the new regime maintains the players actually signed in January set the true tone of their approach, which is to develop a smaller squad with two top-class players in every position. Under Thaksin, they say, signings were made without long-term planning and it is not clear how much Hughes was even involved with some of them. City had one of the Premier League&apos;s largest squads, yet with some of the least Premier League experience. Wayne Bridge, Shay Given and Nigel de Jong are regarded as solid signings for the future, and Craig Bellamy a striker right for a team in transition. Some scoff, arguing that, at \u00a353m for those four, City overpaid, but Mansour&apos;s team are happy it was reasonable business, particularly for January. Although Cook was widely derided for his comments after the Kaka deal fell through, the club insists that the substance of what he said was true, that City were the party that pulled out. Hughes himself said inexperience in how football deals are done was a factor in City being burned so badly, and the club says lessons have been learned. The list for this summer will undoubtedly include some top-rank players, including David Villa from financially stricken Valencia, and Mansour&apos;s team believes that in a recession, and with other clubs&apos; debts beginning to bite, it will be a buyer&apos;s market in which they will not overpay. Hughes has said, too, that four or five transfer windows are necessary to assemble the squad City want, which makes \u00a3200m-\u00a3250m a working estimate for what Mansour will spend. Added to the cash spent buying the club and signing Robinho, that would take Mansour&apos;s investment in City to about \u00a3500m within two to three years. That, sources say, remains significantly less than it would have cost to buy a ready-made top club, and City, with its &quot;till-I-die&quot; support and new stadium already built \u2013 unlike Everton or Tottenham \u2013 was the major football opportunity Mansour had been waiting for when Thaksin&apos;s representative, Pairoj Piempongsat, arrived, cap in hand, in Abu Dhabi last year. Mansour&apos;s people sympathise with the position Hughes was in when they took over and admire the application and attention to detail of the man they describe as &quot;the brightest young manager in the Premier League&quot;. Yet City&apos;s 10-year plan demands success along the way and, for all the goodwill, Hughes requires a strong finish in City&apos;s final five matches, which include the Old Trafford derby on 10 May, to head into the summer review demonstrating overall progress. He will also need to resolve the doubts about whether he can wrest the best from Robinho, Elano and other stellar names, not just on big European nights, but on winter fixtures away in the league. &quot;I am proud,&quot; Scheel said last week, &quot;that a club owned by its fans can beat one owned by a billionaire.&quot; Sheikh Mansour is planning to establish that as billionaires go, Manchester City did get lucky \u2013 second time around.", "publicationDate": "2009-04-21T23:05:05Z", "tags": ["Manchester City", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport", "Thaksin Shinawatra"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/apr/22/manchester-city-sheikh-mansour-thaksin-shinawatra", "title": "Manchester City's fortunes wane and wax in tale of two billionaires, says David Conn", "sentences": ["In October 2008 in his absence, Thaksin was sentenced to two years in prison by Thailand&apos;s supreme court for having in 2003 abused his authority as prime minister to facilitate Pojaman&apos;s purchase of land in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Yossi Benayoun insists Liverpool will keep fighting Manchester United all the way to the end of the season for the Premier League title despite their damaging 4-4 draw at home to Arsenal last night.

Benayoun, who snatched the equaliser in the second minute of stoppage time on a dramatic night at Anfield, said the resilience of the players meant United could not afford to be complacent. &quot;It&apos;s very difficult. United are a strong side but we won&apos;t give up and we will continue to try and do our best,&quot; said the Israel international. &quot;We will keep trying, look to win our remaining matches, and hopefully we can still do it. It was great game for the supporters to watch but not for us because we made too many mistakes.

But as I drop my bags, kick off my flip-flops and dive into a turquoise sea, the &quot;P&quot; word is the only way to describe what I&apos;m seeing.  Bobbing about on my back, I strain my eyes right and left in a bid to spot another human being, but all I can see is smooth white sand stretching away in both directions for about three miles. Mountains rise up just behind the beach, huddling together to increase my privacy. And as if that&apos;s not utopian enough, I&apos;ve even got my own &quot;private&quot; beach bar, where resident mixologist Bledi rustles up mojitos for \u00a33 a pop.  In Albania, this counts as expensive. No wonder increasing numbers of backpackers are making their way over here. According to student travel specialist STA Travel, there has been a huge rise in demand for trips to the country, which was once regarded as Europe&apos;s poor relation.  &quot;We have noticed a massive increase in the number of gap-year travellers and backpackers wanting to try Albania,&quot; says STA&apos;s Ian Swain. When I went backpacking, in the late 90s, it was all about Thailand, with its talcum-powder sand, beach huts and low-key bars. But getting there required an endurance test of 15 hours in economy class, not to mention a sizable dent in the student loan. My trip to Drymades Beach involved only a three-hour flight. All right, I then had to spend a few more hours on the bus that weaves its way along the rocky mountain roads that lead south from Tirana, the capital city. But that just meant I had the opportunity to hop off en route and explore some of the country&apos;s coastal nooks and crannies. The Albanian Riviera stretches nearly 300 miles from Vlore down to Butrint, forming one of the last stretches of unspoilt shoreline in Europe. Around almost every corner there&apos;s a strip of empty sand that has managed to escape invasion by the package holiday hordes.  Heading out of Tirana for the coast, one of the first places I stopped at was Orikumi, home to the ruins of an ancient village dating back to 600BC. In other countries it would all be roped off, with overpriced tickets and T-shirts on sale. Here, however, I could wander at will around the remains, crunching along a path strewn with bits of old Roman pottery. I felt like a pasty-faced Indiana Jones stumbling across a lost city. While a large proportion of Orikum (as the village was originally called) is buried under the nearby estuary, the amphitheatre, market stalls and sacrificial altar are still largely intact.  From here, my route continued up into the Cika Mountains, where the smell of pine trees and hot earth wafted in through the open windows of the bus, fuelling my desire to find a beach and cool off as soon as possible. I didn&apos;t have to wait much longer. After winding up through the Llogara Pass, at 1,100m (3,609ft), the road began to weave its way down to the coast and I got my first glimpse of what the backpackers are getting so excited about. The edge of Albania stretched out into the distance, bordered the whole way along by a ribbon of white sand. The only symptoms of human &quot;civilisation&quot; were the domes of the machine gun bunkers scattered every few hundred metres along the shore - leftovers from the country&apos;s paranoid dictator Enver Hoxha, who died in 1985.  Reaching the coast, we turned off the tiny &quot;main&quot; road and headed down to Palassa Beach, bouncing down a track that would break the average rental car. I wasn&apos;t about to complain about having my teeth shaken loose over the potholes, though; the lack of tarmac is the main reason why the region has yet to be gripped by the tentacles of mass tourism. The reward for those prepared to put in the effort is a three-mile stretch of beach to call your own. The only sound here is the hypnotic rattle of pebbles being raked over the shoreline. In 48BC, Julius Caesar landed here from Rome, on his way to battle Pompey at Pharsalus in northern Greece; I&apos;ve a hunch it hasn&apos;t changed much since. As with most of the beaches I came across, there&apos;s nothing (and no one) stopping you from simply plonking a tent up and spending a few nights here.  Do that, though, and you&apos;re in danger of missing out on Bledi&apos;s freshly made mojitos. Drymades is the next beach along, and it&apos;s here that pebbles are replaced by smooth sand and a mellow soundtrack of Cafe del Mar-style tunes.  After emerging from my spontaneous dip I finally bump into another visitor. Edward is an Albanian artist looking for inspiration. &quot;I love it here,&quot; he tells me, as we wait for Bledi to mix mojito number three. &quot;You should see it first thing in the morning, when the sun comes up. It&apos;ll blow your mind.&quot; It wasn&apos;t just the beach bar lifestyle that brought back memories of backpacking in Thailand; the accommodation was similar, too. Tucked away in the woods behind the beach are a bunch of wooden, one-bedroom huts, with kitchens and shower rooms. They are basic but comfortable - especially when you&apos;re spending most of your time catching rays on the beach.  If you do find yourself craving some civilisation (ancient or modern), you&apos;ll find it just a couple of hours&apos; drive away, in Saranda. When the sun goes down, you can see the lights of Corfu twinkling across the water like tiny glow-worms in the distance.  A few days after dragging myself away from Drymades, I sit sipping the froth off a cappuccino while fishermen putter about in the little harbour, their boats chock-full of freshly caught fish. I could happily spend the day here, watching the world go by, but this is merely a pause on the way to Butrint.  The ruins of this city form an architectural index of ancient history, with Greek, Roman and Venetian remains all contained on one tiny island. Located half-an-hour&apos;s drive south of Saranda, on the edge of a beautiful blue lagoon, it was a thriving port for more than a thousand years and is now a Unesco world heritage site.  Starting at sea level I amble along avenues of shady trees, working my way up through time until I reach the island&apos;s highest point. The route takes me past an ancient Roman bathhouse and Christian baptistry, before leading me up steps worn smooth by centuries of shuffling feet to the magnificent Venetian castle. In the 15th century this would have provided an important early peek at hostile visitors; now it&apos;s ideal for spotting sea eagles circling over the electric-blue water.  Albania is not all old ruins and rudimentary beach huts, though. Making my way back north towards Tirana, I spend the final few nights at a boutique hotel, Rapo&apos;s, in the village of Himara.  This is the first glimpse I get of Albania&apos;s potential future - one with Wi-Fi, swanky dark wood sunbeds and poolside waiter service. While it&apos;s all very nice, I can&apos;t resist sneaking off down a nearby track to find yet another deserted beach. Developers must be itching to get their hands on this place but, for now, the backpackers have it to themselves.

The initial outbreaks across North America reveal an infection already travelling at higher velocity than did the last official pandemic strain, the 1968 Hong Kong flu. Stealing the limelight from our officially appointed assassin, H5N1, this porcine virus is a threat of unknown magnitude. It seems less lethal than Sars in 2003, but as an influenza it may be more durable than Sars. Given that domesticated seasonal type-A influenzas kill as many one million people a year, even a modest increment of virulence, especially if combined with high incidence, could produce carnage equivalent to a major war. Meanwhile, one of its first victims has been the consoling faith, long preached by the World Health Organisation, that pandemics can be contained by the rapid responses of medical bureaucracies, independent of the quality of local public health. Since the initial H5N1 deaths in Hong Kong in 1997, the WHO, with the support of most national health services, has promoted a strategy focused on the identification and isolation of a pandemic strain within its local radius of outbreak, followed by a thorough dousing of the population with antivirals and (if available) vaccine. An army of sceptics has contested this viral counter-insurgency approach, pointing out that microbes can now fly around the world (quite literally in the case of avian flu) faster than WHO or local officials can react to the original outbreak. They also pointed to the primitive, often non-existent surveillance of the interface between human and animal diseases. But the mythology of bold, preemptive (and cheap) intervention against avian flu has been invaluable to the cause of rich countries, like the US and UK, who prefer to invest in their own biological Maginot lines rather than dramatically increasing aid to epidemic frontlines overseas, as well as to big pharma, which has battled developing-world demands for the generic, public manufacture of critical antivirals like Roche&apos;s Tamiflu. The swine flu may prove that the WHO/Centres for Disease Control version of pandemic preparedness \u2013 without massive new investment in surveillance, scientific and regulatory infrastructure, basic public health, and global access to lifeline drugs \u2013 belongs to the same class of Ponzified risk management as Madoff securities. It is not so much that the pandemic warning system has failed as it simply doesn&apos;t exist, even in North America and the EU. Perhaps it is not surprising that Mexico lacks both capacity and political will to monitor livestock diseases, but the situation is hardly better north of the border, where surveillance is a failed patchwork of state jurisdictions, and corporate livestock producers treat health regulations with the same contempt with which they deal with workers and animals. Similarly, a decade of urgent warnings by scientists has failed to ensure the transfer of sophisticated viral assay technology to the countries in the direct path of likely pandemics. Mexico has world-famous disease experts, but it had to send swabs to a Winnipeg lab in order to ID the strain&apos;s genome. Almost a week was lost as a consequence. But no one was less alert than the disease controllers in Atlanta. According to the Washington Post, the CDC did not learn about the outbreak until six days after Mexico had begun to impose emergency measures. There should be no excuses. The paradox of this swine flu panic is that, while totally unexpected, it was accurately predicted. Six years ago, Science dedicated a major story to evidence that &quot;after years of stability, the North American swine flu virus has jumped onto an evolutionary fasttrack&quot;. Since its identification during the Great Depression, H1N1 swine flu had only drifted slightly from its original genome. Then in 1998 a highly pathogenic strain began to decimate sows on a farm in North Carolina and new, more virulent versions began to appear almost yearly, including a variant of H1N1 that contained the internal genes of H3N2 (the other type-A flu circulating among humans). Researchers interviewed by Science worried that one of these hybrids might become a human flu (both the 1957 and 1968 pandemics are believed to have originated from the mixing of bird and human viruses inside pigs), and urged the creation of an official surveillance system for swine flu: an admonition, of course, that went unheeded in a Washington prepared to throw away billions on bioterrorism fantasies. But what caused this acceleration of swine flu evolution? Virologists have long believed that the intensive agricultural system of southern China is the principal engine of influenza mutation: both seasonal &quot;drift&quot; and episodic genomic &quot;shift&quot;. But the corporate industrialisation of livestock production has broken China&apos;s natural monopoly on influenza evolution. Animal husbandry in recent decades has been transformed into something that more closely resembles the petrochemical industry than the happy family farm depicted in school readers. In 1965, for instance, there were 53m US hogs on more than 1m farms; today, 65m hogs are concentrated in 65,000 facilities. This has been a transition from old-fashioned pig pens to vast excremental hells, containing tens of thousands of animals with weakened immune systems suffocating in heat and manure while exchanging pathogens at blinding velocity with their fellow inmates. Last year a commission convened by the Pew Research Center issued a report on &quot;industrial farm animal production&quot; that underscored the acute danger that &quot;the continual cycling of viruses \u2026 in large herds or flocks [will] increase opportunities for the generation of novel virus through mutation or recombinant events that could result in more efficient human to human transmission.&quot; The commission also warned that promiscuous antibiotic use in hog factories (cheaper than humane environments) was sponsoring the rise of resistant staph infections, while sewage spills were producing outbreaks of E coli and pfiesteria (the protozoan that has killed 1bn fish in Carolina estuaries and made ill dozens of fishermen). Any amelioration of this new pathogen ecology would have to confront the monstrous power of livestock conglomerates such as Smithfield Farms (pork and beef) and Tyson (chickens). The commission reported systemic obstruction of their investigation by corporations, including blatant threats to withhold funding from cooperative researchers . This is a highly globalised industry with global political clout. Just as Bangkok-based chicken giant Charoen Pokphand was able to suppress enquiries into its role in the spread of bird flu in southeast Asia, so it is likely that the forensic epidemiology of the swine flu outbreak will pound its head against the corporate stonewall of the pork industry. This is not to say that a smoking gun will never be found: there is already gossip in the Mexican press about an influenza epicentre around a huge Smithfield subsidiary in Veracruz state. But what matters more (especially given the continued threat of H5N1) is the larger configuration: the WHO&apos;s failed pandemic strategy, the further decline of world public health, the stranglehold of big pharma over lifeline medicines, and the planetary catastrophe of industrialised and ecologically unhinged livestock production.", "publicationDate": "2009-04-27T13:30:00Z", "tags": ["World news", "Swine flu", "Mexico", "Health policy", "Politics", "The meat industry", "Environment", "Flu", "Life and style", "Americas"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/27/swine-flu-mexico-health", "title": "Mike Davis: The swine flu crisis lays bare the meat industry's monstrous power", "sentences": ["Just as Bangkok-based chicken giant Charoen Pokphand was able to suppress enquiries into its role in the spread of bird flu in southeast Asia, so it is likely that the forensic epidemiology of the swine flu outbreak will pound its head against the corporate stonewall of the pork industry."]}, {"article": "Argentina&apos;s former world number three Guillermo Coria has quit tennis at the age of 27, saying he has lost his motivation. &quot;I didn&apos;t have any more desire to compete,&quot; the former French Open finalist told Radio Continental. &quot;I had been thinking about it for several months and in Thailand I realised that it was a struggle for me to travel.&quot; Coria, who won nine singles titles and was runner-up at Roland Garros in 2004, last played at an ATP Challenger tournament in Bangkok in March.

The mindless violence of the mobs, fanned by former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra in exile, has demolished any claim to being a movement dedicated to restoring democracy. Thaksin \u2013 the ousted billionaire who bought and sold Manchester City during time spent in the UK \u2013 has carefully cultivated the image of being a &quot;persecuted democrat&quot; and victim of the 2006 military coup. But that image has been massively tarnished by his recent performance two weeks ago, inciting &quot;revolution&quot; from his exile in Dubai, egging on the pro-Thaksin mobs in their red-shirts which transformed the capital into a battle zone. The result was not a revolution, but thuggish attacks on the prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva&apos;s car. The anarchy that led to the cancellation of the Asean summit forced the prime minister to invoke a state of emergency on 12 April (lifted on 24 April). The weak coalition government backed by the royalist movement of the &quot;yellow shirts&quot; had come into power as a result of a court decision to dissolve the ruling party for vote-buying and corrupt practices in the last election. Whatever the merits of the pro-Thaksin opposition calling for new elections, many Thai citizens were repelled by the orgy of angry violence. The attempted assassination of Sondhi Limthongkul, one of the leaders of the yellow-shirted PAD (People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy), by heavily armed gumen, is a further block to any chance of a reconciliation between the two movements \u2013 pro-Thaksin &quot;reds&quot; and the anti-Thaksin royalist movement of &quot;yellows&quot; that has so polarised the nation. Thailand has become trapped between two sections of the ruling elite, both lacking real democratic legitimacy. What is happening is not a struggle between a real champion of the rural poor versus the urban rich elite, but rather a bitter feud between two rival wealthy elites. The December 2008 decision of the constitutional court to dissolve the ruling party for electoral fraud helped to catapult the Oxford-educated Abhisit into leadership of a coalition government backed by the royalist movement (who always wear yellow, the colour linked to the the monarchy). The other wing of the Bangkok ruling elite is represented by Thaksin&apos;s new business oligarchy of Chinese-Thai networks backed by the red-shirt supporters. They are able to orchestrate well-funded disruptive mass protests, bankrolling days and weeks of agitation. The red shirts were taking revenge this month for the yellow shirts&apos; shutdown of Bangkok&apos;s international airport for a week in December 2008. Both forces have inflicted vast losses to tourism, exports and trade, sending the Thai economy reeling. But still key issues are unresolved. Rival camps are warily peering into the future and preparing for what is expected to be a messy royal succession, given that the ailing and octogenarian king Bhumibol Adulyadej, the one unifying force, is not expected to live much longer. Neither under Thaksin in his rule of the country from 2001 to 2006, nor under the current coalition government backed by the king&apos;s advisers and the old moneyed classes, has Thailand enjoyed real democracy. Thaksin had used profits from his huge telecom empire to hire some of the world&apos;s top PR companies. Hong Kong-based PR guru Samuel Moon has set up a website for the ousted PM, Building A Better Future Foundation, a name that might fool the gullible into believing that Thaksin had turned into a budding philanthropist. But his record in office was far from democratic according to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. His contempt for human rights is indicated in his 2003 &quot;war on drugs&quot;, in which Human Rights Watch reported the deaths of more than 2,000 people (pdf). In reality Thaksin has never believed in democracy any more than other Asian strongmen of the last few decades \u2013 Singapore&apos;s Lee Kuan Yew, Malaysia&apos;s Mahathir Mohamad and Cambodia&apos;s Hun Sen. There are some valid grievances that the Democrat party-led coalition government has to address to break the elite stranglehold on politics and to empower the millions in the countryside and the urban poor, who feel their voice is never heard in Bangkok&apos;s ruling circles. Thaksin wooed them, and handed out a few gimmicky benefits, but never really empowered them. Thaksin and his red shirts have suffered a serious setback and were forced to abandon their Bangkok rampage, but they have vowed to return to the streets in the future. Thaksin, a fugitive from a two-year sentence for corruption whose Thai passport has been cancelled, has obtained a passport from Nicaragua and become a financial adviser to the Bahamas and the Central African Republic. Abhisit faces the unpleasant prospect that Thaksin will never give up plotting his return. The stability of the old order in Thailand is over. There is no going back, but is there any way forward? These days, the poor demand to be heard \u2013 the old Thai political order is dead. Despite Abhisit&apos;s elitist origins,his commitment to democracy and dialogue means he may hold the key to bridging the gap between the reds and the yellows. If he can consolidate his government and wean those in the countryside away from Thaksin&apos;s toxic legacy, which has poisoned the country&apos;s capacity for peaceful dialogue, there may be a solution. That would require the Democrat party to transform itself into a vehicle of change, shaking off its elitist origins and delivering some real benefits to the rural poor. And the democratic constitution of 1997 \u2013 trashed both by Thaksin and by the military-appointed regime that succeeded him in 2006 \u2013 has to be rehabilitated. Abhisit&apos;s survival depends on his ability to reach out to the poor and enact social reform, so that he and his coalition will be relevant to a new era of Thai politics in which it will be the poor who eventually decide that Thaksin is also history and they have more to gain from stability and development. A mountain of a task for a young prime minister. But the alternative is a continuation of this cycle of protests, turmoil and in all probability another coup, which is the main reason why even many poor Thai in the countryside hope that Abhisit might just succeed.", "publicationDate": "2009-04-29T19:30:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/29/thailand", "title": "Tom Fawthrop: After Thailand's bitter feud, an uncertain future", "sentences": ["Amid all the clouds of tear gas, the confusion and the sight of angry red-shirted mobs that tried to seize control of Bangkok, one thing clearly emerged from the smoking debris of burnt-out buses.", "The other wing of the Bangkok ruling elite is represented by Thaksin&apos;s new business oligarchy of Chinese-Thai networks backed by the red-shirt supporters.", "The red shirts were taking revenge this month for the yellow shirts&apos; shutdown of Bangkok&apos;s international airport for a week in December 2008.", "There are some valid grievances that the Democrat party-led coalition government has to address to break the elite stranglehold on politics and to empower the millions in the countryside and the urban poor, who feel their voice is never heard in Bangkok&apos;s ruling circles.", "Thaksin and his red shirts have suffered a serious setback and were forced to abandon their Bangkok rampage, but they have vowed to return to the streets in the future."]}, {"article": "Effervescent movie producer who put Asian films on the international map Wouter Baren-drecht, the co-chairman of Fortissimo Films, was an important influence on contemporary independent film production. He has died aged 43 from heart failure in Bangkok, where he had gone to view the rough-cut of his latest production, Nymph.  In its first years Fortissimo worked principally as a sales agent, but in 2000 Barendrecht embarked on work as executive producer with Clara Law&apos;s The Goddess of 1967. In the past seven years he was producer, co-producer or executive producer on more than 30 films, including works by European directors such as Peter Greenaway, Alex van Warmerdam, B\u00e9la Tarr and Sergei Bodrov and the American gay directors Gregg Araki and John Cameron Mitchell, whose Shortbus shocked and invigorated Cannes audiences in 2006. The greater part of Barendrecht&apos;s work, however, was with Asian directors. In Thailand, where he established a second home, he had worked with Apichatpong Weerasethakul and Pen-Ek Ratanaruang, for whom he produced four films, including the still-unfinished Nymph. Springtime in a Small Town (2002) revived the career of the mainland Chinese director Tian Zhuangzhuang, who had been prevented from making a film for nine years after his film Blue Kite was overly critical of the Chinese government. Recent notable prize-winning films have included Zhang Yang&apos;s Getting Home (2007) and Kiyoshi Kurosawa&apos;s Tokyo Sonata (2008), which won last year&apos;s jury prize at the Chicago international film festival. Fortissimo&apos;s most recent production, Tsai Ming-liang&apos;s Face (2009), has been selected to compete in the Cannes festival. When honoured with an industry toast at the Hamptons international film festival last year, Barendrecht was styled &quot;the playboy of the Pacific rim&quot;, and his zest for life was enormous. The secret of his success lay not just in his passion for films and his excellent and catholic taste, but much more in his gigantic and embracing personality. It was near impossible to catch him without the beaming and always sincere smile. He was a persuasive marketer too. If he told you a film should be seen, you took care to see it.  Born in Amsterdam, Barendrecht was the son of an insurance company manager and a nurse. He studied theatre sciences at the University of Utrecht - although he had already made his mark at 15 with a well-argued liberal political treatise, which caught the attention of the Dutch royal family. Film quickly came to dominate his interests, and from 1987 to 1990 he was an energetic contributor to the Rotterdam international film festival and its Cinemart. In February 1990 he moved briefly to the Berlin film festival as a press officer for the Forum des Junges Films. In 1991, he returned to Rotterdam to become co-ordinator and programme adviser, with particular concern for Cinemart. Established in 1984, this was the first platform of its kind to offer film-makers the opportunity to launch their projects to the international film industry. Many films of the last quarter-century owe their existence to Cinemart, of which Barendrecht became a board member after leaving the festival in 1997. In 1991, he formed Fortissimo Films, joined in 1995 by Michael Werner, who in 2000 became his co-chairman. The two seemed an ideal partnership, and Fortissimo went rapidly from strength to strength. Initially based in Amsterdam, in 1997 - on the suggestion of the director Wong Kar-Wai - Fortissimo set up an office in Hong Kong, which was the base for most of the production activities.  Barendrecht&apos;s gift of friendship was phenomenal. He was known and loved worldwide, but seemed capable of returning every friendship. He delighted in his homosexuality, which made him, throughout his career, an influential supporter of gay cinema. His most lasting legacy, however, will remain his success, through his productions and influence, in changing the international market for and the international perception of Asian films. He was founder and honorary adviser of the Hong Kong-Asia film financing forum, a member of the advisory board of the Thai film federation and panel consultant for the Asian film awards. In 2007 he and Werner received the CineAsia award of excellence. He is survived by his parents and his brothers. A foundation has been established in his name to support talented young film-makers.  \u2022 Wouter Barendrecht, film producer and marketer, born 5 November 1965; died 5 April 2009", "publicationDate": "2009-04-29T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/30/obituary-wouter-barendrecht", "title": "Wouter Barendrecht", "sentences": ["He has died aged 43 from heart failure in Bangkok, where he had gone to view the rough-cut of his latest production, Nymph."]}, {"article": "Spandau Ballet, leg-warmers, the Rubik&apos;s Cube, big hair, synthesisers, Yuppies, the Falklands War and Margaret Thatcher. All of them, and plenty more besides, are currently being reformed, repackaged, reappraised or resold. The 1980s, the decade that began with Lady Diana falling in love with Prince Charles, are being reinvented. The sporting landscape in Britain then was totally different. Football was suffering an image problem, mostly because of hooliganism and stadium disasters, and there was no Sky, and therefore far less televised football. Amazingly, snooker regularly drew a bigger audience. The waistcoated men of the green baize were genuine superstars: Steve Davis, Jimmy White, Alex Higgins and Dennis Taylor were able to earn small fortunes while the country went as Snooker Loopy as Chas &amp; Dave in their top-10 hit of 1986. Step forward Neal Foulds, Eddie Charlton, Joe Johnson, Kirk Stevens, Cliff Thorburn, Willie Thorne, Bill Werbeniuk, Alain Robidoux, Jim Wych, Doug Mountjoy, Mike Hallett, Silvino Francisco, Tony Meo, Tony Knowles and David Taylor, aka the Silver Fox: all supporting acts who found their names suddenly lit up. With football in the doldrums, the wall-to-wall coverage of snooker \u2013 18.5 million watched Davis lose to Dennis Taylor on the final black of the 1985 World Championship final \u2013 revealed enough drama to keep lucrative \u00adsponsorship money flowing in, fill \u00adcolumn after column on the sports pages, and fuel constant pub debate. &quot;It&apos;s difficult to look back to those days without smiling. All I remember is earning loads of money and laughing all the time,&quot; says Barry Hearn, the impresario who joined forces with Davis in 1975 before dominating snooker in the 1980s with his Matchroom sports management company, which looked after many of the prominent players. &quot;Nothing compares to those 10 years. It was led by these amazing characters \u2013 Bill Werbeniuk drinking 16 pints in a day, Terry Griffiths singing Welsh lullabies, Willie Thorne giving you the best price on the favourite, Dennis Taylor telling his jokes, Jimmy White the little urchin and Davis being boring,&quot; says Hearn, who tells his yarns like a prospector recalling the discovery of Klondike gold. &quot;I was in my office in 1981 and the telephone went. A voice said: &apos;Mr Bally Hearn? This is Channel 7 TV Bangkok. We want you to come here.&apos; I didn&apos;t even know where Bangkok was. The BBC&apos;s pictures were going all around the place, you see. &quot;He said: &apos;Steve Davis is world champion, you&apos;re his manager. How much do you want?&apos; I had no idea. I said: &apos;Twenty thousand dollars.&apos; When he agreed, I thought &apos;Bollocks! I could have done better than that.&apos;&quot; Davis won the first of his world titles in 1981 when he beat Doug Mountjoy, yet snooker&apos;s &quot;Gazza 1990&quot; moment might be traced to Alex Higgins&apos; tears when the errant Irishman won a second world title the following season. That was the sixth year the World Championship had been played at Sheffield&apos;s Crucible Theatre. The arena&apos;s atmosphere for the showpiece event was another vital ingredient in the sport&apos;s allure. And when the chain-smoking, argumentative Hurricane broke down clutching his baby daughter on live television, Box-Office Snooker was born. That same year Tony Knowles was a 26-year-old former Bolton art college student with good looks and a mullet haircut. In his second appearance at the Crucible he trounced the defending champion Davis 10-1 in the first round. It was big news. As were his tabloid revelations about his bedroom exploits with snooker groupies the following season. &quot;It was all a long time ago now,&quot; Knowles tells Observer Sport. He was fined \u00a35,000 by the WPBSA, the governing body, for bringing snooker into disrepute. &quot;But beating Davis by such a score was a career highlight,&quot; he says, before also picking out his two tournament wins. The first of those was in the Scottish Open of 1982 against David Taylor. Now 65 and a hotel owner in Cheshire, Taylor says: &quot;The biggest moment of my life was reaching the semi-final of the World Championship in 1980. And, I also commentated on Steve Davis&apos;s 147.&quot; That was the first televised maximum break, but it was overshadowed by Thorburn pulling off the same feat at the Crucible a season later against Griffiths, which was one of snooker&apos;s key moments as the sport built towards a critical mass. &quot;It was purgatory because my wife had just lost a baby and she&apos;d told a friend not to tell me,&quot; says Thorburn, now 61 and living back in Canada. &quot;Then I made the 147, was having a glass of champagne and it slipped out. When I called my wife there was a press photographer saying, &apos;Come on Cliff, smile, smile!&apos; because of the 147, while my wife&apos;s sobbing.&quot; Thorburn, the 1980 world champion, headed a five-strong Canadian contingent at the time. Robidoux, a former World Championship semi-finalist who still plays in Canada, arrived in 1988 as a 27-year-old &quot;with only my suitcase and not even speaking the language&quot;. Jim Wych, now 54 and a commentator, reached the quarter-finals at the \u00adCrucible in 1980 at his first attempt &quot;which is still the record for an overseas player&quot;, he proudly says, and &quot;Big&quot; Bill Werbeniuk, who drank 16 pints of lager to settle his nerves, reached four World Championship quarter-finals. He died six years ago. In 1985 Stevens, who in his pomp had a penchant for wearing all-white suits at the table, was involved in the era&apos;s most notorious episode. Francisco, a 39-year-old South African, defeated him in the British Open final before accusing the 27-year-old of being as &quot;high as a kite.&quot; Francisco was fined and docked ranking points before Stevens admitted to a cocaine addiction. It proved to be a final contested by two cursed players. While Stevens&apos; career never recovered, Francisco was later forced to work in a fish and chip shop to survive and in 1997 was caught smuggling \u00a3115,000 worth of cannabis through Dover. He served three years in prison. When Observer Sport caught up with both men they were reluctant to speak. On the phone from Toronto, Stevens, who is the current Canadian Open champion but no longer plays the professional circuit, was asked about his experiences. &quot;No thanks, I&apos;m all right,&quot; he said. When Francisco&apos;s son was contacted in Leeds the Observer was told that his father had mellowed with age. &quot;I&apos;ll give him a ring and tell him [to call].&quot; But the player once known as the Silver Fish never rang back. Davis was back in the World Championship final the year after losing to Taylor, but Joe Johnson, a 33-year-old from Bradford who had never before won a match at the Crucible, beat Davis comfortably 18-12. &quot;It was a fairytale,&quot; Johnson says. &quot;But I had no fears. Everybody treated Steve Davis as God, but I&apos;d played him as an amateur \u2013 we&apos;d never met as professionals \u2013 and beaten him 10-1.&quot; Johnson put down his cue when he was 53 and is now a commentator for TV channel Eurosport, alongside Hallett, who turned professional in 1979 with Jimmy White and Tony Meo. &quot;It was family \u2013 we used to travel to Hong Kong, New Zealand, Australia and Thailand. One year I played 21 events,&quot; says \u00adHallett who, at 49, is still competing, having won close to \u00a31m. Hallett describes himself as fortunate to have played during what Foulds, who did become a millionaire and is now a BBC commentator, says was &quot;the best time for snooker. There was less sport on television, less to do if you were indoors. And, there were a few charismatic people around.&quot; White, the loser of six world finals but always the crowd&apos;s darling &quot;because I took on shots&quot;, certainly had personality. Now 45, he has not given up the dream. &quot;It&apos;s a bit of a sickener that I&apos;ve never won a world final, but I believe I can still win it,&quot; says the Whirlwind, who will be watching the final tomorrow. White also believes that despite the loss of sponsors \u2013 the 2004 ban on tobacco advertising hobbled many tournaments \u2013 and the lowering of snooker&apos;s profile in a modern era that offers myriad leisure choices, the game retains robust health. He points to the World Championship&apos;s new sponsor (Betfred.com) and the fact that more than 100 million viewers in China watched Ding Junhui and Liang Wenbo play in the first round a fortnight ago. In a sense White is right. But, it is hardly the same. &quot;Fucking hell, it was only a game of snooker,&quot; is Hearn&apos;s closing reflection on his and the sport&apos;s golden period. &quot;But we were introduced to state governors and ambassadors. &quot;In China in 1983, Steve Davis did a billiard exhibition in front of the top man and his government. They all came in with these little girls helping them \u2013 basically the game had to be stopped every 10 minutes because they were all incontinent and had to keep going to the loo. &quot;People who weren&apos;t around then can&apos;t understand what it was like.

It was expected to be held this week, he said, but was unable to confirm a date. Morris said she had been granted permission to meet tomorrow with Orobator, who is five months pregnant. It was initially thought the Briton might face trial as early as today but a Foreign Office spokeswoman confirmed the hearing is due to take place later this week.

We just seek clarity from the Lao government as soon as possible as to what exactly is going to happen so that we can advise her properly.&quot; The British vice-consul from Bangkok in the neighbouring country of Thailand flew to Laos yesterday to check on Orobator. A spokesman for the embassy said: &quot;[The vice-consul] will try to see her today. We are trying very hard to ensure that she does have good legal representation.&quot; British authorities have only been able to visit Orobator for 20 minutes once a month after learning of her arrest when she had already spent many months in jail. There is no British embassy in Laos \u2013 the nearest is in Thailand. Orobator was born in Nigeria and moved to south London to live with her aunt from the age of eight. She stayed in Camberwell and Peckham before leaving the country to travel to Ireland, the Netherlands and Thailand. She is understood to have been arrested at Wattay airport in Laos on her way back to the UK last summer. Her mother, Jane Orobator, a student at Trinity College Dublin, broke down yesterday as she said: &quot;I&apos;m just appealing to the British government, to the Laos authorities, to just please release her. I just want them to bring her back to me. I&apos;m really terrified. I have been crying my eyes out.&quot; Mrs Orobator said she had no idea why her daughter was in Laos last summer and did not believe it when she heard of her arrest around late September. She said the accusations were totally out of character for her daughter, whom she described as a quiet, shy, small-built girl who looked like a young teenager. Phonthong prison where Orobator is being held has a reputation for beatings and brutality. Since 2003 at least 39 people have been sentenced to death in Laos, where smuggling more than 500g of heroin carries mandatory capital punishment.

It is understood that Orabator told the authorities that the drugs found in her case were not hers. &quot;The trial is expected to be held this week but I don&apos;t know the exact dates,&quot; Laotian government spokesman Khenthong Nuanthasing told Associated Press. &quot;The trial will be carried out fairly.&quot; Her mother, Jane Orobator, who lives in Dublin with three of her other children, told the Guardian that she was very worried. &quot;She is very fragile, just a little thing,&quot; she said. &quot;I can&apos;t begin to imagine what she is going through.&quot; She said that initially she did not believe that her daughter had been arrested for drug trafficking. &quot;She is not that type of person at all, it is totally out of character,&quot; she said. &quot;We are just hoping that she will be allowed to come home soon.&quot; The British vice-consul from Bangkok embassy was due to see Orabator tomorrow, a Foreign Office spokesperson said. Born in Nigeria in 1988, Orobator moved to the UK when she was eight years old and grew up in Peckham, south London. In July last year she went to the Netherlands for a holiday and from there to Thailand and Laos. The amount of heroin she was caught with exceeds the statutory minimum for the death penalty.

Samantha Orobator, who is five months pregnant, was arrested at Wattay airport, Vientiane, in August last year, allegedly in possession of 0.6kg (1.3lb) of heroin, but her detention only recently came to light. A Laotian government spokesman told CNN that pregnant women cannot be sentenced to death in Laos. A spokeswoman for the legal rights charity Reprieve said Orobator&apos;s trial could be put back until she has given birth, leaving the possibility of a death sentence open. She said: &quot;We are acting on the assumption anything is possible because we have been denied access to Samantha.&quot; Orobator, 20, was allowed to see a British government official today but was refused a visit by Reprieve. The Foreign Office said the vice-consul from Bangkok had been allowed into Phonthong prison to speak to Orobator ahead of her expected trial this week. But Anna Morris, a lawyer who has flown to the south-east Asian country on behalf of Reprieve, said she was refused access although she had arranged to meet the Briton. Reprieve said no explanation had been given by the Laotian authorities as to why the meeting was cancelled. Morris said: &quot;I am deeply frustrated by the lack of access to this vulnerable young woman. &quot;I also do not have any news of a trial date, despite being told at incredibly short notice that it will take place this week. &quot;Reprieve is in Vientiane [the Laotian capital] to ensure that Samantha&apos;s basic human rights are respected and protected. We urge the Lao authorities to allow us access to speak to Samantha as promised, to appoint her a Laotian lawyer and to conduct a fair and open trial process.&quot; The Foreign Office minister Bill Rammell is due to raise the case with the Laotian deputy prime minister when they meet in the UK on Thursday.

His latest novel, From Aberystwyth With Love, documents the search for Hughesovka, a legendary replica Aberystwyth built in the Ukraine in the last century. Buy From Aberystwyth With Love from the Guardian bookshop &quot;All my life I have been fascinated by tales of those vagabond souls who go off searching for promised lands and Shangri-las. People who sailed beyond the dawn driven by the belief that the other man&apos;s grass skirt was always greener. It&apos;s probably why I have devoted my life to chronicling those spiritual misfits, the people of Aberystwyth.&quot; 1. The Quiet American by Graham Greene Ostensibly it is about the eponymous quiet American \u2013 a naive and idealistic CIA agent in Saigon during the French colonial war of the 50s. But what lingers is the relationship between the world-weary newspaper correspondent, Fowler, and his beautiful girl Phuong. Greene perfectly skewers the superfluity of western notions of love that invariably inform such situations. Undermining the idyll is the mercenary elder sister, painfully aware of the need to use Phuong&apos;s beauty to secure a provider for the family while her beauty still has currency.  2. A Woman of Bangkok by Jack Reynolds One night in Bangkok, so the song goes, makes a hard man humble. The city is, in fact, a combine harvester for the ex-pat male heart. Jack Reynolds captures the ethos perfectly in this, the definitive account, written 50 years ago. A young and unworldly Englishman is posted to Bangkok and falls for a beautiful dancing girl in the Bolero nightclub. The girl requites his love by spit-roasting him with scorn, and turning him into a chump. Reynolds chronicles the various stages of his downfall, without mercy. Read it before you get posted, but don&apos;t expect it to save you. 3. The Alexandria Quartet by Lawrence Durrell After reading this many years ago I vowed never to visit the city. How could it possibly live up to its fictional portrayal? An unnamed English teacher on a Greek island looks back on his sojourn in Alexandria between the wars. He considers the intertwined fates of the people he met there; they are numerous, but the real protagonist is the city herself, exquisitely presented in all her shifting moods and lemon-tinged light. Some tastes might find the relentlessly extended languor a touch too much, in which case John Crace&apos;s satirical digested read [http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/29/digested-classics-justine-lawrence-durrell] of the first book, Justine, is a perfect antidote. 4. The Discovery of Tahiti; a journal of the second voyage of HMS Dolphin round the world under the command of Captain Wallis, RN, in the years 1766, 1767, and 1768, written by her master George Robertson He didn&apos;t actually settle there but his description of the island set the tone for the innumerable vagabonds, beachcombers, castaways, mutineers, buccaneers, poets, lovers, dreamers, romantics, and novelists from Aberystwyth who have since fetched up on those parakeet-coloured shores. The salt-rimed tars who had spent six months in the foetid wooden hold of the HMS Dolphin suddenly found themselves in a land where sex was offered to weary travellers as naturally as food. Each one found a sweetheart and all she asked in return was a ship&apos;s nail. All was bliss until the ship fell apart. I went there with a ship full of nails but the price had gone up. 5. As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning by Laurie Lee &quot;Mum, I&apos;m nineteen and I&apos;ve decided it&apos;s time I sought my fortune. I will walk to Spain. I&apos;ll land in Vigo and walk the breadth of the land, playing my violin, getting drunk on sherry and sleeping under the stars with a sloe-eyed sweetheart in my arms.&quot;Sounds like a good plan, son, I&apos;ll make you some treacle biscuits.&quot;And off he went. That&apos;s it in a nutshell, but it&apos;s well worth reading the whole thing. 6. The Gentleman in the Parlour by Somerset Maugham You stand in a sun-dappled, bee-throbbing English churchyard, reading the graves. Curiously, everyone in this town seems to have died in their thirties. The dark-skinned priest waves and you remember with a start you are in Sri Lanka. The headstones were made in Glasgow and shipped out, like the lives they commemorate. I always picture Somerset Maugham as the eponymous gentleman in the parlour. He sits on the verandah at Raffles, chronicling the desolate fates of the broken souls washed up on the remoter shores of Empire; their lives pickled in gin and quinine. 7. Thomas Cook European Railway Timetable You shouldn&apos;t travel without a book of poetry, and this is mine. Foreign railway stations are a spiritual &apos;home&apos; for the exile. Trams glide round equestrian statues outside; food kiosks, information and cambio booths rub shoulders in dusty cathedrals smelling of salami and Czech beer. Most of the romance has gone, but some still survives fossilised in the pages of the Thomas Cook timetable.  8. Speak, Memory by Vladimir Nabokov Nabokov writes an elegy to his lost childhood in pre-revolutionary St Petersburg; the backward lens of time imparting a particularly golden hue to such remembered exotica as Pears soap, Golden Syrup and countless other marvels shipped out from London. The prose is wonderful and occasionally sublime, especially in the child&apos;s eye view of the five-day train journey each summer to Biarritz. 9. Under the Volcano by Malcolm Lowry Another dissolute ex-pat drinking himself methodically to death in a sun-blanched land. Mexico on the Day of the Dead, his ex-wife turns up to shake some sense into him but he&apos;s not in the market for sense. Instead he drinks. It&apos;s hot; there&apos;s an incident with a whore; he has an argument with a police captain, never a good idea but that&apos;s probably why he does it. Then the Day of the Dead comes to an end, and so does he. Someone throws a dead dog into the ravine after him. I&apos;ve read it countless times and am still not sure quite why I like it so much. But I&apos;ve ordered the dog for my funeral. 10. A Moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway Hemingway in Paris in the 20s. Starving, living in a garret with his wife, but somehow able to write in the morning and go to the races every afternoon. It all seems so achingly romantic that it comes as a shock in later years to find out it was mostly bollocks - he wasn&apos;t really starving but had loads of money. Ah well. The bits about sharing the place with Ezra Pound, F Scott Fitzgerald, Ford Madox Ford, John Dos Passos, James Joyce and Gertrude Stein are true.

Barton is simply not in a position to criticise anyone, and his alleged after-the-fact bravado merely emphasised rather than disguised the reality that his brainlessness had finally caught up with him on the football pitch. Enough is enough, said Malcolm Macdonald of the latest spot of bother, and while not necessarily wanting to agree with every knee-jerk reaction from rent-a-quote old-timers recruited by Setanta Sports News to fill the void caused by official Newcastle spokespeople refusing to comment further on the matter, the old boy seems to have a point. Trouble is, Newcastle are likely to have to sell Barton rather than sack him, and if Shearer can pull that off he should forget about management and consider a career in marketing. Even Mike Ashley, who has a career in marketing, is going to struggle. The Barton charge-sheet was longer than a chimpanzee&apos;s arm before he managed to get suspended for the rest of the season with his foul on Xabi Alonso at Anfield. Sam Allardyce and one or two other Premier League managers may not be put off \u2013 managers always need to see the best in people and often believe they can put the most spectacular train crashes back on the rails \u2013 but managers don&apos;t pay players wages. Chairmen do that and, especially in these straitened times, with supporters constantly asking themselves whether football is worth the outlay, it will take a brave chairman to put Barton on the payroll. For one thing he doesn&apos;t come cheap, for another he is far from proven value in terms of games played, and while he remains a potentially useful player when unhampered by injury, suspension, custody or unfavourable switch of manager, he is hardly a unique talent. In short, there are plenty of reasons why you would not spend northwards of \u00a340,000 a week to have Barton at your club, and not that many reasons why you would. It seems hard to believe now, but it was only in September 2007, ie a couple of months into last season, that Newcastle fans reacted to a 3-1 defeat by Sven-Goran Eriksson&apos;s Manchester City with taunting chants of &quot;We&apos;ve got Joey Barton&quot;. Allardyce had just signed him for Newcastle from City, though he was still awaiting his debut after breaking a metatarsal in a pre-season game against Carlisle, so Newcastle fans were actually still waiting to see what they had bought for \u00a35.8m. If they had been reading the papers up till that point they would have been aware of Barton misdemeanours involving walking out on Kevin Keegan, causing a mass brawl in a pre-season friendly at Doncaster, stubbing a cigar in a team-mate&apos;s eye, breaking a pedestrian&apos;s leg in a late-night car smash in Liverpool, rowing with an Everton fan in a Bangkok hotel, handing in a transfer request, dropping his shorts at Goodison, damaging a taxi and being suspended by his own club after a training ground altercation with Ousmane Dabo. On the credit side, Barton made his England debut, not undeserved, towards the end of his time at City, but once a Newcastle player he waited only four months before describing the crowd as &quot;vicious&quot;, was jailed for six months for assault and affray in Liverpool, and banned by the FA over the Dabo incident. That&apos;s form, and that&apos;s only an edited version. It could be argued Barton has also been unlucky, the Liverpool game was his comeback from another metatarsal fracture sustained in January, but anyone proposing to offer him the benefit of the doubt should put themselves in Ashley&apos;s shoes and ask what benefit he has brought Newcastle. Picking up an immediate suspension, just when he might have been coming to the club&apos;s rescue, suggests a player who still lacks the ability to control himself or help himself. Any chairman who imagines he might be a useful acquisition at a price should wear blinkers to negotiate the deal, because clearly it did not work out that way for the last buyers. Here are the figures. Games \u2013 32. Days in jail \u2013 74. Wages \u2013 around \u00a360,000 per week. Cost \u2013 \u00a35.8m. Age \u2013 26. Number of last chances \u2013 possibly unlimited. Present transfer value \u2013 probably just that. It depends whether anyone is willing to accept him as a present. Ronaldo, Emir of the Emirates To think there were people who thought Cristiano Ronaldo was something between a show pony and a flat-track bully, a trickster who could flummox ordinary opponents in the blink of an eye but one who never seemed to make an impact in the very biggest games. Perhaps it is Portugal&apos;s dismal attempt at qualifying for next year&apos;s World Cup that is concentrating the Manchester United player&apos;s efforts on his club form at the moment, but he was close to unplayable at the Emirates as his team reached their second successive Champions League final. Ronaldo must be fed up about hearing how Lionel Messi is the best player in the world at the moment, but Messi does not beat goalkeepers from 40 yards out, run the length of the pitch to finish moves he has started with a back-heel in his own half, or meet crosses with headers so powerful they remind his manager of Tommy Lawton. Fair enough, Ronaldo didn&apos;t score with his head against Arsenal (last season&apos;s goal against Roma was the one that so impressed Sir Alex Ferguson), but he did just about everything else. He scored two goals and made the other, and had he put Real Madrid or Juventus to the sword in such thrilling fashion in a semi-final on their own ground he would have had a new nickname conferred upon him by now. Something along the lines of El Beatle or the Lion of Vienna. Something to acknowledge for posterity a single night of greatness on a foreign field. As it was only Arsenal at the Emirates, and a not especially convincing Arsenal at that, Ronaldo&apos;s performance seems less likely to pass into legend. A pity. The English domination of the Champions League is robbing the competition of much of its lustre. Ronaldo will just have to be content with knowing that no other player has taken his side to the final with a goal from over 40 yards out in the quarter-final and another one from the same distance in the semi-final. Arguably the one at Porto deserves to be better remembered as it came from open play (and it was on a foreign ground), though one suspects the Emirates effort from a free-kick will be endlessly replayed due to a sublime commentary moment from Clive Tyldesley. If you haven&apos;t seen it yet I won&apos;t spoil the punchline for you. Suffice to say that if Tyldesley thought Manuel Almunia should have anticipated the shot he won&apos;t be telling him anytime soon.", "publicationDate": "2009-05-06T12:43:35Z", "tags": ["Joey Barton", "Newcastle United", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/may/06/joey-barton-newcastle-united-sell-sack", "title": "Joey Barton is a train crash who Newcastle will struggle to sell, writes Paul Wilson", "sentences": ["If they had been reading the papers up till that point they would have been aware of Barton misdemeanours involving walking out on Kevin Keegan, causing a mass brawl in a pre-season friendly at Doncaster, stubbing a cigar in a team-mate&apos;s eye, breaking a pedestrian&apos;s leg in a late-night car smash in Liverpool, rowing with an Everton fan in a Bangkok hotel, handing in a transfer request, dropping his shorts at Goodison, damaging a taxi and being suspended by his own club after a training ground altercation with Ousmane Dabo."]}, {"article": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) today increased its global tally of confirmed swine flu cases to more than 2,300, as British scientists announced they had worked out the full genetic code for the virus. Five new cases were diagnosed in the UK today \u2013 four schoolchildren and an adult linked to Alleyn&apos;s School in Dulwich, south London, which has been closed all week after six pupils were diagnosed with the illness. There are now 39 confirmed cases in the UK. Mexico remains the worst affected country, with more than 1,100 laboratory-confirmed human cases of H1N1 virus influenza, including 42 deaths. The United States has reported nearly 900 laboratory-confirmed human cases, including two deaths. Another 22 countries have confirmed cases but no deaths. The latest figures came as the health secretary, Alan Johnson, said the Health Protection Agency, which monitors infectious diseases, had fully mapped the genetic code of the virus. He said this would help scientists to understand how the virus operates and to identify the parts that can be used to manufacture a vaccine. On a visit to a laboratory in Hertfordshire, he was told that researchers hope European manufacturers will be able to take delivery of prototypes in the coming months to enable mass production of a vaccine to begin. Johnson said: &quot;A significant step towards protecting the world&apos;s health against swine flu has been taken. We now look to the vaccine industry to produce the required quantities of vaccine as quickly as possible.&quot; The entire genetic fingerprint and sequence of the swine flu virus will now be analysed to learn how the virus behaves as it infects individuals. At a meeting of Asian health ministers in Bangkok today, the WHO director general, Dr Margaret Chan, said the world was &quot;better prepared for an influenza pandemic than at any time in history&quot;, largely because of precautions taken over the threat of bird flu. She said: &quot;Years of alert and expectation mean that most countries now have preparedness plans. Vaccine manufacturing capacity has increased sharply. Large stocks of antiviral drugs have been produced and procured. &quot;Right now, treatment courses from the WHO stockpile are being shipped to more than 70 countries in the developing world.&quot; Mexico&apos;s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva said he would raise concerns at the WHO annual meeting later this month about &quot;discriminatory&quot; measures imposed against the country, its people, and its exports because of the flu. China has placed dozens of Mexicans in forced quarantine as a protective measure against the spread of the virus. Around the world, public opinion seems to be shifting from fear of a pandemic to scepticism as to whether the virus poses a significant threat. Half of 2,000 Britons surveyed yesterday said they believe the government over-hyped the threat of swine flu, and are now less worried about it spreading. The research by online polling centre Toluna found two-thirds of respondents thought the government had coped well with the outbreak, while more than half (54%) thought the NHS was well prepared to cope with a possible pandemic. The report noted a decline in public worry about the virus spreading, with 40% worried about the virus, compared with 50% last week. Public health officials around the world acknowledge their worst fears about the new virus have yet to materialise. But many experts worry that people will become too complacent and fail to heed warnings if the virus returns in a more dangerous form in the autumn. &quot;People are taking a sigh of relief too soon,&quot; said Dr Richard Besser, acting director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. &quot;The measures we&apos;ve been talking about \u2013 the importance of hand-washing, the importance of covering coughs, the real responsibility for staying home when you&apos;re sick and keeping your children home when you&apos;re sick \u2013 I&apos;m afraid that people are going to say, &apos;Ah, we&apos;ve dodged a bullet.

Thinking makes us self-conscious and &quot;according to Meisner, self-consciousness is death for an actor.&quot; Mark is an earnest, thirtysomething ex-soldier-turned-actor who served in Bosnia, and is prone to clenching his fists at his stomach, &quot;where our emotions start&quot;. For the past five years, he has been teaching and following the acting method pioneered by the late American acting guru Sanford Meisner (he refers to him affectionately as &quot;Sandy&quot;).  Now he is leading a two-day course in &quot;acting for non-actors&quot; at the Actor&apos;s Temple in London. Joining me for my &quot;journey&quot; (as the organisers bill it) is Terry, whose wife was &quot;completely changed&quot; by a similar course; Peter, an American business school professor, who has tried acting but found his emotions too frozen; Linda, a senior solicitor, and her friend Sharon, who has suffered from ME for 12 years; social worker Naomi, who&apos;s &quot;here to become funny&quot;; Laura, back from &quot;a crazy night in Bangkok&quot;, and Jim, a motivational speaker. What is Meisner supposed to do for us?  Meisner&apos;s &quot;method&quot; relies heavily on repetition: according to Meisner you grasp the essence of a character not by exploring your own emotional memories but by repeating phrases over and over again to develop improvisation and spontaneous behaviour, which you then use during a performance. By using the technique, Mark believes, we&apos;ll be able to establish deep connections with other people, so long as we are willing to accept nuggets of &quot;truth&quot; that are thrown at us - things we may not want to hear, or things that we don&apos;t think are true. That, at least, is the idea. After the first day, spent on concentration and relaxation exercises, we&apos;re thrown into a full day of the repetition exercise, which involves standing opposite your partner and telling them what emotion you&apos;ve read from their behaviour. If the person opposite me looks nervous, I say, &quot;You&apos;re nervous.&quot; He, in turn, has to acknowledge my observation and say, &quot;I&apos;m nervous.&quot;  Taking turns on the stage, we all point out and accept things. It is a non-stop volley of repetitions, which continue until another impulse takes over. But telling a stranger how they feel can be difficult. It&apos;s also quite frustrating being told you&apos;re feeling something that you don&apos;t and having to agree. My session is with Peter the business professor, and I find the intensity of his changing emotions overwhelming. I feel he responds according to what I say he&apos;s feeling so I tell him he&apos;s easily managed and he&apos;s acting. He gets angry, he cries. Later, Peter suddenly tells me I look sad. I&apos;m actually frustrated. Afterwards, some of us are enthused, others less so. Linda thinks &quot;Mark was inspirational&quot;. I realise that it wouldn&apos;t be a bad thing for me to get angry more and stop thinking too much. I also find myself looking and listening to people more closely. But there are limitations to selling the &quot;heavy stuff&quot; beyond the space it was designed for. For non-actors, the technique is an emotional release but not a one-size-fits-all cure. The emotions induced by the technique were real, affecting and honest.

The sun has fallen into a gap between clouds that have dulled the day, and the farmlands of County Kilkenny. &quot;That&apos;ll be your last Irish sunset for a while,&quot; I say, for the 25-year-old is on his way to Dublin airport, and then to Rome, Bangkok and finally Perth, Western Australia. He looks away. &quot;There will be a lot of lasts now,&quot; he replies, &quot;but I don&apos;t look at life like that.&quot; For 15 years, as the Celtic tiger has leapt and growled, the Irish countryside has been sustained by developers who, on a credit binge fed by bankers, have built and built and built. There was a belief that, at long last, the humiliations of the past were over. Anyone who warned of a bubble was abused, not least by the former Taoiseach, or prime minister, Bertie Ahern, who said, &quot;I don&apos;t know how people who engage in [moaning] don&apos;t commit suicide.&quot; I first met Michael before Christmas, while researching an article about the Gaelic sport of hurling. The team sheets listed occupations: carpenters, plumbers, masons. &quot;It used to be that my friends wanted to go to college, then they started dropping out of school and taking on apprenticeships,&quot; he&apos;d told me. &quot;They were paid \u20ac1,000 a week and they were only 20 years old. They blew it all; out every weekend, nice car, nice clothes. They didn&apos;t think it would end.&quot; But end it has. Each village we pass is home to empty apartment blocks. The wound of emigration - which seeped for decades, even centuries - has reopened. &quot;A couple of years ago, I might have known two people in the whole of Australia,&quot; Michael says. &quot;Now I know 30.  I have about five or six friends in Perth alone, all from within 10 miles of my house.&quot; As I travel round Ireland, I will be told that the boom has changed the country for ever and, what with modern air travel, the exodus this time will be temporary. Yet technology, in the form of Facebook and Skype, is a powerful new agent in the emptying of villages. &quot;Those who go are in contact with the lads back home,&quot; Michael says. &quot;They are telling us what a good time they are having, asking, &apos;What&apos;s keeping you?&apos;&quot; The network that has always been so important in Ireland - those ties of kinship and geography - now sucks the young away.  A little while before, Michael stood up from the farmhouse table, picked up a small rucksack and his hurling sticks, and said he&apos;d best be going. His mother sat straight-backed, the pain hard in her eyes, her jaw set, as her son had a last gulp of tea. He tells me later that his parents &quot;hadn&apos;t really spoken&quot; about his departure, &quot;but my mother is unhappy&quot;. This renewed emigration, after 15 years of migrants returning, horrifies the older generations. They know all it will take is a good job, a mortgage or a marriage to keep Michael abroad. &quot;They want to know when I&apos;ll be back, but I don&apos;t really know,&quot; he says, as we head into the darkness. &quot;If it doesn&apos;t work out in Perth, I wouldn&apos;t be averse to New Zealand.&quot;  On Dublin&apos;s Custom House Quay, six starving figures stagger towards an invisible ship.

The houses may be lovely - for the most part redbrick, substantial and sitting in generous lawns - but they are far from palatial. Yet in 2005, a home here sold for \u20ac58m. There are plenty of astonishing figures in this boom. There were 6,507 racehorses in training in Ireland in 1992, yet by 2008 some 12,119 thoroughbreds were kicking up the gallops. From four private aircraft, the numbers of helicopters and jets rose to an estimated 80, with more being bought in Ireland than in any other EU country. Where once there were only a few thousand people who could afford to follow Munster&apos;s rugby players abroad, an estimated 65,000 arrived in Cardiff in 2006 to watch them become European champions.  And now? Well, in the 2006 census there were 200,000 empty homes, a figure that will now have significantly worsened. Horses are being offered to trainers by hard-up owners, or being left by the side of the road, or even shot. &quot;All those planes and helicopters are for sale,&quot; I am told by one businessman.  Still, for many, the good times had been grand. In the late 1980s, economists close to Fianna F\u00e1il, the broadly centrist political party that has clung to power like few others in Europe, had slashed taxes, regulations and corporate rates in order to make Ireland third only to Hong Kong and Singapore as the world&apos;s most free-market country. The move, satirised by journalists as the &quot;Doheny &amp; Nesbitt School of Economics&quot;, after the pub they claim had given birth to it, would see 40 per cent of all American money invested in Europe wash up on Ireland&apos;s shores.  Ireland had two booms, explains Fintan O&apos;Toole, commentator, critic and historian. The first came in the 1990s. Foreign investment offered work and opportunities to the well-educated, English-speaking workforce. The whole country rose on the tide, and many of those who emigrated in the 1980s came home. As the millennium turned, however, a parasite embedded itself in the economy. Recessionary interest rates set by the European Central Bank allowed Irish bank executives to borrow huge sums, which they lent to their chums in the property business (and sometimes to themselves). When Anglo Irish Bank, the worst offender, called in the government in December 2008, it had lent 15 people more than \u20ac500m each. This money fuelled an explosive burst of confidence. A series of spectacular new buildings appeared downstream from those starving figures on the banks of the Liffey. The &quot;Builders&quot;, as the big property developers are called, sold land to each other at spiralling prices. These men - they were all men - whose fathers might have ended up working on English construction sites, were commissioning skyscrapers not just in Ireland, but in New York, Chicago and London, arrowing around the globe on Falcon jets. They set an example that every Irishman who had ever put mortar to brick followed. The Builders became glamour figures. In 1999, one of the most notorious bought a plot, perhaps a quarter of an acre, in Shrewsbury Road for Ir\u00a33m, and then promptly sued the neighbour who had sold it to him in a boundary dispute. As he built his house, Sean Dunne, 54, compact, likeable, with neatly groomed grey hair and small, terrifying blue eyes, must have sensed he was where he wanted to be, a long way from his childhood in County Carlow, in southeast Ireland, where, as he once put it, &quot;If me or my siblings needed a bath we went for a swim in the River Slaney.&quot; Dunne would fly close to an economy burning like the sun. He caught the country&apos;s imagination in 2004 when he followed his wedding to a gossip columnist with a 14-day celebration in Italy aboard the Cristina O, Aristotle Onassis&apos;s old yacht, complete with guests such as rugby international Ronan O&apos;Gara and fashion designer Karen Millen. It was &quot;redolent of nothing so much as The Great Gatsby,&quot; cooed the Sunday Independent, with a mixture of awe and sarcasm. Dunne then stunned the public with the purchase, at the height of the boom, of seven acres of Dublin&apos;s fancy Ballsbridge neighbourhood for \u20ac379m. He planned to raise a &quot;diamond-cut skyscraper&quot; of 37 storeys. Much of the country was going crazy. The German ambassador caused a diplomatic incident when he complained that Irish life had become coarse. The church, so long a moral force, was silent, muzzled by a succession of scandals involving paedophilia and the abuse of children in care. To explain what had happened, Fintan O&apos;Toole takes me to Les Fr\u00e8res Jacques, a restaurant opposite Dublin castle that &quot;in better times&quot;, he says, had been a favourite of poets. When we visit, it is empty. &quot;Our story was one of failures since independence,&quot; he explains. &quot;In the 1950s, there were serious analysts saying there would be no one left on the island. In the 1980s, the Irish Development Agency put up a poster at the airport showing a graduation class of University College Dublin, and it said, &apos;We are the young Europeans&apos;. A year later it turned out that every person in the poster was gone. &quot;When your young are leaving, there&apos;s a sense of national inferiority, of failure,&quot; O&apos;Toole explains. &quot;You know at a fundamental level that the country isn&apos;t working. At a familial level, it&apos;s awful. It leaves a pretty deep scar. Then when people start coming back, there is a very tangible sense of change, of hope.&quot; According to O&apos;Toole, &quot;People bought into the idea that this wasn&apos;t just an economic boom - it was a national vindication, a healing, the sense that our bad past was gone, and gone for ever.&quot; But he warns against confusing a sense of humiliation with an understanding of the past: &quot;One of the most ridiculous clich\u00e9s about the Irish is that we are obsessed with history. In recent decades it&apos;s been the opposite; we have been living in a continual present, in the sense that now is the only place that ever existed.&quot; On 6 October 2003, in Goatstown, a suburb of Dublin, one of the winners in Ireland&apos;s boom met one of the losers, and for both, that moment was surely all that had ever existed. Charlie Chawke had just carried the weekend takings from his pub, the Goat, to his car - it was more than \u20ac48,000. &quot;I looked into my mirror and saw this guy coming at me with a sawn-off shotgun hanging from his left shoulder,&quot; he says. &quot;He opened the car door and said, &apos;Give me the effing money.&apos; I could see the gun and I went for it. I was a hurler in my time and fancied my chances.&quot;  Charlie isn&apos;t a man who takes much notice of lessons of history, and so, in his way, he embodies the change that swept through Ireland over the past 20 years. He was raised behind the bar in his father&apos;s pub in the village of Adare, outside the western city of Limerick. He moved to Dublin and, a natural-born gambler, bought the Goat. He used the leverage offered by the banks to expand and, it&apos;s fair to say, enjoy himself. Now he is part-owner of Sunderland football club, a shareholder in Celtic, and owner of eight pubs across Ireland. The first point to be made about Charlie is that by 2003 he was a millionaire, possibly many times over. There was no need for him to fight, but he fancied his chances. But then, like many of his compatriots, he&apos;s not a man to put much store in the lessons of history. He missed the gun. &quot;I fell. So, I was lying on the ground and he said, &apos;Ach, you&apos;re a smartarse,&apos; and he put the gun to my knee and blew the whole knee away.&quot; Charlie nearly died on the road as his staff attempted to stem the flow of blood with a tablecloth.  Point two about Charlie is that he seems to know everyone. He was, for example, once friends with Sean Dunne. In fact, as the Builder pushed for planning permission for his 37-storey diamond-cut dream in Ballsbridge, Charlie took over a bar on the site. That didn&apos;t end well either. Dunne grew dissatisfied by the value of the contract and wanted more. Charlie refused, and so his staff were locked out of Dunne&apos;s hotel on the very day his daughter was getting married in Adare. &quot;He ruined my daughter&apos;s wedding,&quot; says Charlie. &quot;And I can never forgive that.&quot; Point three about Charlie is that he remains gloriously unembarrassed by the clique at the heart of Irish life, and the part he played in it. To discover why, we talk about a horse called Forpadydeplasterer. In 2007, Charlie had an idea while driving back from the Galway races, an annual jamboree infamous for its swirl of money, politics, traded favours and drink. The then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern - &quot;a very nice man and a good friend of mine&quot; - was having a few problems over undeclared donations. Asked to name the donors, Ahern had caused hilarity by identifying one, now a wealthy developer, as Paddy the Plasterer. &quot;I thought, &apos;Now that&apos;s a great name for a horse,&apos;&quot; says Charlie. So Charlie bought a horse and called it Forpadydeplasterer, and because Charlie had also given Ahern money, unkind observers have suggested this might constitute two fingers up to the authorities. And then what happens? Forpadydeplasterer wins the Arkle Chase at Cheltenham.  &quot;We&apos;re a very small country and if I want something done, somebody&apos;ll know somebody who&apos;ll do me a turn,&quot; says Charlie. &quot;And maybe that has been part of the problem. We find it hard to refuse people. I know in my business if somebody comes in and needs 500 quid, they get it, and they&apos;d expect to get it.&quot; And as it goes with Charlie, so it went with Ireland. The Builders went into see their friends in the banks and the money was handed over. They got it, and they expected to get it. Of course, not everyone made beasts of themselves. So far this has been the story of machismo, yet among the Irish middle classes, there were great benefits from a strengthening economy. &quot;There is an expectation that everybody made money in property, but many of us didn&apos;t,&quot; gallery owner Josephine Kelliher tells me. &quot;We did well, in that we had steady jobs and bonuses. We were able to do pretty ordinary things: two holidays a year, buy a painting, put on an extension.&quot;  But Josephine, like many professionals, now finds the country she thought she knew dramatically changed: &quot;I am very disappointed, and embarrassed. People genuinely had no idea this level of mismanagement was going on.&quot; Josephine left business school in 1989 and opened a contemporary art gallery, so had the perfect view on an extraordinary transformation. &quot;Starting in 1996, there was a huge influx of people who&apos;d worked abroad all their adult lives and had expected to stay abroad for ever,&quot; she says. &quot;They were in their 30s and 40s, and certainly, I had never expected to see their return.&quot; The consequent cultural renaissance allowed her to prosper, building up clients, often through the architects working the space between Dublin&apos;s cultural life and the Builders. She wasn&apos;t alone. The gay scene, so long hidden, burst out and took its rightful place in society. But now, the architects are going bust.  So who is to blame for all this? The Builders? Well, only a fool would have mistaken them for angels. The banks? Certainly, Sean FitzPatrick, Anglo Irish&apos;s ex-chairman, makes Sir Fred Goodwin look prudent. But as O&apos;Toole argues, such conjecture is to let the guilty go free: &quot;To place all the blame with the banks is a cop-out. This was crony capitalism, a political problem. We&apos;ve had two prime ministers in the past 20 years who were on the take - Ahern and Haughey. Which is a lot, considering we&apos;ve only had five.&quot; There is another moment in recent Irish history worth recalling. It&apos;s 14 May 2001 and Bertie Ahern is throwing a party for 1,400 at Dublin castle, celebrating the rise of an Irish archbishop to cardinal. Ahern had sent out the invitations in his name and that of his then girlfriend, Celia Larkin. This romance was already a thorn in the new cardinal&apos;s side. Celia is a beautician and her parlour, Beauty at the Blue Door, stands all but opposite the cardinal&apos;s front door. Each morning, as the archbishop left his house, he would not only be reminded of the moral decay at the top of Irish society but also of the latest innovations in ladies&apos; grooming, including the Brazilian. Celia was swiftly exfoliated from the party&apos;s greeting line.  These days, the priest can relax. An increasing number of people are attending mass. Ahern stepped down when his finances proved too shaming, replaced by Brian Cowen, the former finance minister, who, while unloved, is seen to be honest. Meanwhile, Sean Dunne stands in a small conference room in the Berkeley Court Hotel, Dublin, working out how to cover the interest payments on the ground below, his skyscraper dreams ruined by the planning authorities. Charlie Chawke sits in his pub, mildly regretting a few business deals but declaring the recession over, in the Goat at least, because of his win at Cheltenham. As I leave that evening, he is singing quietly to himself: &quot;Padydeplasterer, nobody does it fasterer.&quot; But the recession isn&apos;t over. High society may have adjusted, eschewing Dublin&apos;s Michelin-starred restaurants in favour of lower-key eateries such as the Town Bar &amp; Grill (the night I was there, Tony O&apos;Reilly, the great business prince of the years before the boom, walked in - an event the owner said was unprecedented). Beyond such glamour, the collapse of the property bubble has seen unemployment rise past 11 per cent, banks nationalised, the economy forecast to shrink by 8.3 per cent, negative equity engulf great swathes of the population, the nation&apos;s international credit rating downgraded, economists warn of national bankruptcy, and taxes rising by \u20ac4,000 for the average family. As Paul Krugman, the Nobel prize-winning economist, recently wrote, &quot;As far as responding to the recession goes, Ireland appears to be really, truly without options.&quot; I take a train out of Dublin to Adamstown, and step out into a weird semi-wilderness. The station is like the bridge of the Starship Enterprise, manned by a lone ticket collector almost mad with boredom. Outside, a single building stands in a churned-up field, the centrepiece of a new town once heralded as the model of Irish development. I follow the deserted road east, beside a plyboard fence announcing a yet to be built swimming pool - &quot;Come in, the water&apos;s great&quot; - until I come to two primary schools and a few apartments. It is playtime and all the children are clearly from elsewhere. Which, I confess, comes as a shock. Mena Baskarasubramanian is from the south of India. Until three years ago, she was living in England, but her husband&apos;s job in the IT department of a bank (&quot;I know,&quot; she cries. &quot;I know,&quot;) had been reassigned to Dublin. &quot;When we arrived I heard about Adamstown and so I came to look for a house,&quot; she tells me. &quot;It was 2006 and you wouldn&apos;t believe it, people were queueing all night.&quot; She secured a two-bed apartment for her family for \u20ac300,000. Now chairwoman of the local primary school, Mena explains that 95 per cent of the students are from non-Irish backgrounds, with 26 nationalities. With an open face and wonderful optimism, she talks of the connections she is making, the beginnings of a very Irish network of Croats and Kazaks, Brazilians and Somalis, and Indians, and, more importantly, her fears for it. &quot;Because of the recession, people are going back to their countries. The Polish workers are going. Doctors are moving to the Middle East. I don&apos;t want to lose this beautiful structure we have at the moment.&quot;  The value of Mena&apos;s flat has fallen by \u20ac50,000, and many of the cranes over Adamstown are no longer moving. &quot;Some of the units have been stopped. The retail spaces were supposed to be open last year.&quot; I ask if her small boy will take up hurling. &quot;Probably. My daughter is becoming Irish, she loves Irish dancing. The other day, two children arrived not speaking a word of English, but after four days they were singing Irish songs, thanks to our four language-support teachers.&quot; Again, the enthusiasm falters. &quot;Due to the cutbacks it&apos;s been reduced to two. We don&apos;t know what we&apos;ll do next year.&quot; The Celtic tiger is dying, and nobody knows what will be left. Mena&apos;s fears - about jobs, about negative equity, about the community drifting away - are every woman&apos;s fears in Ireland. Some people tell me that this time it won&apos;t be like the 1980s, that with the whole world in recession there is nowhere for the young to go.  So I email Michael Dermody. &quot;We made it to Perth without any problems,&quot; he writes in reply.  &quot;I am busy house- and job-hunting. It&apos;s a beautiful city and the weather is lovely. I haven&apos;t tried any surfing yet. I heard shark attacks are fairly common this time of year, so reckon I&apos;ll wait another few months.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-05-09T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Ireland", "Young people", "Society", "Recession", "Business", "Europe"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/10/ireland-financial-crisis-emigration", "title": "Ireland: As the Celtic Tiger roars its last, Ruaridh Nicoll reports on fear of an Exodus from Ireland", "sentences": ["&quot;That&apos;ll be your last Irish sunset for a while,&quot; I say, for the 25-year-old is on his way to Dublin airport, and then to Rome, Bangkok and finally Perth, Western Australia."]}, {"article": "Once the exclusive territory of film geeks, these days insider knowledge, appreciation and ability to discuss at length cool Asian cinema are almost - but not quite - as desirable as actually watching the stuff.

The silhouettes of thousands of people line the length of the beach in front of me, and a throbbing bass reverberates in my chest. Just two minutes ago, I was in the middle of that neon-clad throng, dancing full-moon-style with the best of them. And now here I am, making my James Bond-style getaway to quieter shores up the coast. If only I could leave every party in this way.  Unlike its neighbour Koh Samui, the mountainous island of Koh Phangan in southern Thailand has no airport and only a small number of roads. Its terrain has saved it from large-scale development, and much of the island is only accessible by boat. Aside from the mainstream commerciality of Hat Rin, near-deserted beaches and pockets of solitude abound.  In fact, the further up the coast you go, the quieter life becomes. Huge limestone rocks frame the bays, and dense forest rises up the hillside behind. At this time of year - June to September, before the monsoon comes knocking - it&apos;s the islands on the eastern side of the peninsula that remain drier and sunnier.  As we round the headland and point our boat towards the next bay, my shoulders relax. The atmosphere has changed drastically, and in place of the craziness of Hat Rin, a more peaceful scene comes into view - the calm after the party storm. By the light of the full moon, I can just make out wooden huts standing precariously on the rocks. People sit around bonfires on the beach, and the pace of life drops about 20 notches. This is what I love about Koh Phangan. Within a four-mile radius two different worlds exist. As the Thais say, &quot;Same same, but different.&quot; I discovered this particular stretch of coastline after a two-month spell in Nepal. I&apos;d pushed my body to its limits trekking around the Annapurna circuit and contracted a particularly nasty and resilient stomach parasite in the process. A girl I met in Kathmandu told me that to stand any chance of getting well again, I should hop on the next flight to Thailand and get myself to Koh Phangan, pronto.  One plane ride, a night bus, a catamaran, two taxis and a longtail boat later, and I arrived at the Sanctuary resort. Tucked into a corner of Hat Thian beach, the it is the kind of place you book into for a week and end up staying for a month.  Here, among the thatched roofs, decks and balconies above a translucent Gulf of Thailand, health and well-being is a laid-back, low-key affair. The antithesis of a clinical five-star spa, nobody&apos;s going to come at you with a white coat and a clipboard and, depending on your inclination and budget, you can do as much or as little as you like. You can detox or retox, stay in dorm for 120 baht per night (around \u00a32.30) or a 5,400 baht-a-night air-conditioned chalet.  As well as the large tree-house-style restaurant, the Sanctuary has a small shop, a spa offering Balinese body wraps and pineapple scrubs, a plunge pool and a herbal steam room built into the rocks. Incense floats on the breeze and people drift between yoga and meditation classes or laze around in hammocks sipping fresh fruit smoothies.  If you have to up the ante - to add some oomph to your Om - there&apos;s elephant trekking, jet-skiing and cooking classes, along with diving and snorkelling in the Ang Thong marine national park. Many of the Sanctuary&apos;s guests drift in and out of the retreat, interspersing its serenity with the buzz of Hat Rin or less commercial local bars nearby.  Some come just for the yoga, which is held three times a day in a large hall in the jungle, others to gorge on seafood or healthy veggie dishes, tucking into the likes of Thai spinach salad with peanut coconut sauce, or pad pak sai met ma muang (stir fried vegetables with cashew nuts and chilli).  Give it time to settle and there&apos;s kayaking, snorkelling and hikes up to the lookout, not to mention a well-stocked library and workshops on every complementary therapy under the sun. They&apos;re balm for the party animals, who slip away from the Sanctuary to cane it under a full moon before returning for rest and recovery.  To one side, in its own enclave, is the wellness centre - a separate home for the cleansing programmes. Run by a man called Moon, for whom fasting is a way of life, the detoxes range from one to seven days, with milder juice fasts and specific liver-cleansing regimes.  I opt for the three-day cleanse, feeling a little nervous about its psychological and physical effects. Moon tells me to eat nothing but raw fruit and vegetables for two days in order to prepare my body. After that only a coconut, clay and psyllium juice will pass my lips during the fast.  Considering the Sanctuary serves some of the best vegetarian food this side of California, it feels sadistic in the extreme. Moon tells me my body will thank me when it&apos;s all over, while I remind myself that Dolly Parton wrote some of her best songs while fasting. So maybe some good will come of it.  I cast a wistful glance in the direction of the cake cabinet and sulk off to my salad. The cleanse is not for the fainthearted, and it&apos;s a good idea to eat healthily beforehand and get in the right frame of mind, but I was amazed how good I felt after.  Back on solids, and the days pass in a haze of extended mealtimes, chats about life, and swims in the ocean. I make the most of the morning yoga, experience one of the best massages of my life, and leave feeling stronger, happier and more relaxed than I have in a long time.  As well as the Sanctuary, there are a number of smaller-scale resorts, both in Hat Thian and Hat Yuan, that serve phenomenal Thai and Western food. Most also have cheap beach huts to rent. My favourite is the Bamboo Hut, an open-air restaurant with a smattering of bungalows perched on top of the rocks between the beaches. It does a mind-blowing tofu cheeseburger and the best chocolate coconut muffin you&apos;ll ever taste. Fasters need not apply.  \u2022 The Sanctuary (0066 81 271 3614, thesanctuarythailand.com) has dormitory beds from \u00a32.30 a night, and chalets from around \u00a39 a night.

This tended to fly in the face of the evidence. The charge sheet against Thaksin included the awkward detail of his having been labelled &quot;a human rights abuser of the worst kind&quot; by Human Rights Watch after 2,500 people were allegedly killed by the Thai police during Thaksin&apos;s declared &quot;war on drugs&quot; in the country. Thaksin always denied that his rhetoric, blood-curdling as it could be, ever tipped over into ordering extra-judicial murders. In November 2006, he was ousted as PM by the Thai military while he was out of the country. The coup came shortly after Thaksin had sold the family company, Shin Corp, for \u00a31.2bn, on which he was reported to have paid no tax \u2013 news that brought crowds of protestors on to the Bangkok streets. A simple Google search would have informed City&apos;s directors that the new military government had set up an assets examination committee to investigate how Thaksin made his considerable fortune while in office. In short, he was under investigation for corruption offences when City&apos;s directors decided that he was the perfect character to launch their club into a bright blue future. They sold to him for \u00a321.6m, and the largest shareholders, John Wardle and David Makin, were repaid a large part of their \u00a320m loans by Thaksin. His arrival brought the former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson to City and a string of new players. He threw a party in Manchester&apos;s Albert Square, with a free Thai buffet, which thousands of City&apos;s fans lapped up. The Thaksin era unravelled only a year later, when he was convicted on corruption charges and he and his wife, Potjaman, skipped bail and fled Thailand. Then, with the club apparently on the brink of disaster, he found somebody willing to buy City: Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi, the richest backer of any football club in the world. Late last year, Thaksin was refused entry to the UK. &quot;My briefing quite rightly said he has been charged with fraud,&quot; said the immigration minister Phil Woolas. &quot;He is not a desirable person.&quot; City&apos;s directors, when they accepted more than \u00a340m from Thaksin, had not, for some reason, been blessed with the same clarity of vision.", "publicationDate": "2009-05-15T23:05:34Z", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Thaksin Shinawatra"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/16/seven-deadly-sins-football-thaksin-shinawatra", "title": "Seven deadly sins of football: Thaksin's Thai buffet", "sentences": ["The coup came shortly after Thaksin had sold the family company, Shin Corp, for \u00a31.2bn, on which he was reported to have paid no tax \u2013 news that brought crowds of protestors on to the Bangkok streets."]}, {"article": "Parts of Bangkok appeared to be turning into a war zone last night as troops poured indiscriminate fire into unarmed civilian demonstrators, inflicting heavy casualties and plunging the country into crisis. Troops killed and injured scores of men, women and children, initial reports said, sending volleys of rifle fire into a crowd estimated at 20,000 to 30,000 people, which gathered in the evening after a day of protest against Thailand&apos;s unelected prime minister, Gen Suchinda Kaprayoon. Some reports said that troops used machine-guns and that hundreds of people fell as the shooting began. Early this morning renewed gunfire scattered thousands of protesters in Bangkok, witnesses said. Crowds had occupied the top of Rajadamnoen Avenue despite the earlier shooting. Many of the wounded in that incident were brought to the lobby of a hotel close by, which was converted into an emergency surgery trying to cope with the casualties, said to include many shot in the back and head. As mayhem developed in the streets, panic-stricken demonstrators tried to push their way into the hotel. &quot;The place now looks like a cross between a morgue and an infirmary,&quot; a witness said. A doctor spoke of over 100 wounded people being taken to one building. One of those shot was a child who appeared about 10 years old. The carnage will electrify a country already dismayed by the sudden plunge on Sunday night from peaceful demonstration to violent confrontation that left up to 20 people dead and 300 or more injured. &quot;Please tell the world to boycott us, please tell the world to help us,&quot; a distressed law graduate urged yesterday, &quot;I think it&apos;s cruel, very cruel.&quot; The bloody escalation of the confrontation, a result of &quot;disastrous mismanagement&quot; by the military leaders, according to one diplomat, seems certain to force the authorities to impose harsher controls that will further fuel public resentment and wipe out any immediate chance of compromise.

He navigated limitations on free expression by metaphorical allusion. His style was frequently satirical, challenging repressive morality and exposing the hypocrisy of Thai society. The ironic humour and turns of phrase he invented have found their way into everyday Thai discourse.  Rong was born in Chai Nat province, the eldest son of a civil engineer, and educated at the elite Triam Udom Suksa school in Bangkok. Despite demonstrating literary promise, he was expelled after an altercation with a teacher and was obliged to seek employment, including spells as a ship&apos;s helmsman, log yard supervisor and model. The legendary media magnate, writer and politician Kukrit Pramoj, who was Thai prime minister from 1975 to 1976, launched his literary career by taking him on as a columnist and photographer for the Sayaam Rat Weekly in 1954. Rong&apos;s photo-essay, with the evocative title Children of the Garbage Mountain (1956), which featured children scavenging for food, was the beginning of his rise to prominence. It exposed the dire poverty of Bangkok&apos;s underclass and spurred the government into creating a welfare programme.  In the early 1960s - against a backdrop of repressive military rule, rapid economic expansion under the umbrella of American anti-communist influence, and profound social transformation, including urbanisation and the first signs of the emergence of an educated middle class - he produced several ground-breaking novels. Sanim Soi (1961) addressed prostitution, a particularly sensitive area associated with poverty and neglect. Concealed beneath an artificial edifice of public morality are the &quot;paid women&quot; who service the sexual needs of society. In the days before Aids, this was the first Thai book to address sexually transmitted infection. Bang Lampoo Square (1963), named after the inner-city Bangkok district, was a semi-autobiographical account of a school dropout living among petty criminals on society&apos;s edge. Although one might detect the influence of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler in this hard-boiled sample of urban life, Rong did not discover the western world until the mid-1960s. By working as a barman in San Francisco during his prolonged stay (1963-67) as the Sayaam Rat roving US correspondent, he found a window from which to observe a very different cultural scene.  His commitment to promoting sexual liberation as well as his penchant for rock and dashiki dress was reinforced by flirtation with the Haight-Ashbury hippy movement, and his output from this period reflected a psychedelic lifestyle. His earlier novel Sanim Krungtep (the Oxidised Stain of Bangkok, 1961) had anticipated the permissive society by featuring an adolescent middle-class girl from a broken rural home who is lured to Bangkok by a playboy, but Long Glin Gunjah (In a Haze of Cannabis, 1969) introduced his Thai readership to this alternative movement.  Although he never became involved in Thai politics, Rong exposed himself to considerable risk by using his columns to criticise the counter-democratic actions of Thailand&apos;s military rulers, particularly in 1973 and 1976 when many unarmed pro-democracy student demonstrators were massacred by paramilitary elements. He was most recognised as a writer, conversationalist, humorist and bon vivant, accustomed to media and academic celebrity, but he also landed a leading role in the movie Chuafah Dinsalai (Forever Yours, 1955). Three decades later he played the South Vietnamese foreign minister in Stephen Frears&apos;s TV movie, Saigon: Year of the Cat.  From the mid-1980s, Thailand&apos;s cultural elite were habitual visitors to the mountain retreat he designed himself near Chiang Mai, which also became a mecca for aspiring writers and poets, as well as unannounced pilgrims paying homage to their hero. The devotion of his public following was demonstrated by the success of his serialised autobiographical account of life during the second world war, Menu Ban Tai Vang (Menu at a House at the Back of a Palace, 1999).  Rong&apos;s entire output of more than 100 books and thousands of articles was tapped out on his favourite manual typewriter, even after the advent of computers. The critical acclaim of which he was most proud was his recognition as national artist in the field of literature by the National Culture Commission in 1995. He will be best remembered for his relentless exploration of the expressive potential of his own language, and as a writer who could approach topical and often unsavoury themes with a rare brand of insight, honesty and wit.  He is survived by his wife, Tim, and two sons, Leung and Joy.  \u2022 Rong Wongsawan, writer, journalist, photographer, born 20 May 1932; died 15 March 2009", "publicationDate": "2009-05-28T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Books", "Thailand", "World news", "Culture", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/29/obituary-rong-wongsawan", "title": "Obituary: Rong Wongsawan", "sentences": ["Rong was born in Chai Nat province, the eldest son of a civil engineer, and educated at the elite Triam Udom Suksa school in Bangkok.", "It exposed the dire poverty of Bangkok&apos;s underclass and spurred the government into creating a welfare programme.", "Bang Lampoo Square (1963), named after the inner-city Bangkok district, was a semi-autobiographical account of a school dropout living among petty criminals on society&apos;s edge.", "His earlier novel Sanim Krungtep (the Oxidised Stain of Bangkok, 1961) had anticipated the permissive society by featuring an adolescent middle-class girl from a broken rural home who is lured to Bangkok by a playboy, but Long Glin Gunjah (In a Haze of Cannabis, 1969) introduced his Thai readership to this alternative movement."]}, {"article": "Paving contractors top OFT&apos;s offenders list Rogue home improvement traders topped the list of offenders prosecuted by the Office of Fair Trading in the past year for targeting householders with aggressive or misleading sales tactics.

Guests spend average of \u00a3450 on happy day As the wedding season rolls in, it&apos;s not only the brides and grooms that are beset by pre-wedding stress - the guests are too. According to Halifax, 64% of wedding guests believe that couples planning their big day should consider the cost to their guests.  A quarter have made excuses to get out of going to a friend&apos;s nuptials because of the expense, while a further quarter feel under pressure to spend a lot at a wedding.  The bank estimates the average wedding costs each guest \u00a3450, once the price of the stag or hen do (at a typical \u00a393), the wedding gift (\u00a3100), drinks, clothes and accommodation are taken into account. This rises to \u00a3600 if the stag or hen weekend is overseas.  But contrary to popular assumptions about women&apos;s shopping habits, it is men that spend more on their outfit for the day, at a typical \u00a3123 compared to their partner&apos;s \u00a3105.

Perhaps you have an inexplicable affinity for leopard print. Or your shower curtain is covered in butterflies, similar to the one on your ankle. Or you were a Rubenesque, somersaulting toddler and your family nicknamed you Panda.  For me it is the giraffe. My career as a long-necked mammal began at a supermarket checkout circa 1987, when a woman actually said it: &quot;Aw. You look just like a little giraffe!&quot; I looked up to my mother for help, but her face was hidden behind the People announcing Princess Diana&apos;s marital woes. I was left to fend for myself. I must have looked stricken, because the woman said, &quot;Don&apos;t worry honey, it&apos;s a compliment.&quot; &quot;Don&apos;t worry&quot; is code for, &quot;You should really worry a lot about this.&quot; She was a puffin of a woman, smiling warmly down at me. Stick drawings were an accurate representation of my body that year, so I&apos;m sure that my limbs shooting out of a jumper below a mop of brown hair did indeed resemble a baby giraffe.  Up to that point, I was aware of height only insofar as I bruised my knees on my best friend Jeni&apos;s bike handlebars, and that I shopped in the juniors section. I wasn&apos;t concerned until adults started regularly shrieking, &quot;My, look how tall you are!&quot; Rather than looking at my never-ending fingers and saying, &quot;Oh, a piano player,&quot; they opted for a comparison with an African safari creature.  The woman was still looking at me expectantly. I grabbed my mother&apos;s thigh, looked down and quietly said, &quot;Thanks.&quot; Puffin woman would prove to be firmly in line with the rest of society. In my elementary school zoo play, I was the giraffe. In sixth grade, when my science class voted on who would do reports on which animals, I got the giraffe. A decade later, as a 6ft 2in first-year undergraduate at Harvard, the annual water polo team initiation ritual took place at a jungle-themed party. While the other girls wore little black dresses (the panther), faux snakeskin trousers (the python), or tight red sweaters over green minis (the parrot), I wore tapioca yellow Capri pants, ears and chocolate body paint spots. Tall folk are incapable of talking about their height without discussing their family. Height is a trait that comes with a long shadow. There&apos;s always a history. It&apos;s an inheritance.  Mine begins in 1952, when my grandmother bought a baby book in which to note the developments of my mother&apos;s childhood, and began plotting my mother&apos;s height on the growth chart provided. The result is comical: my mother&apos;s height stubbornly refuses to stay within half a page of the chart&apos;s clearly defined &quot;average zone&quot;. By age four, my grandmother&apos;s ballpoint indentations have turned into a panic. The page is filled with erased pencil dots attempting to plot the future. The future said 6ft 2in.  In 1962, my grandmother read in a newspaper about a new oestrogen treatment that brought on early puberty, closing the growth plates around the age of 11, thereby skipping the furious years of growth at 12 and 13. Up to that point, my mother&apos;s tall childhood had been textbook: &quot;Amazon Arline!&quot; she was called. &quot;Daddy Long Legs&quot;. Ten thousand queries of, &quot;How&apos;s the weather up there?&quot; One of her legs was already permanently shorter than the other from her hip-drop stance, where she spread her legs into an upside-down V and shifted one hip downward so the socket dropped, shaving off three or so inches. With slouching, she could reduce herself by nearly five inches.  The photo albums are consistent with the baby book: a coltish girl with never-ending legs under an afro of auburn curls. Arline pouting in a slouch on family vacation. Arline pouting in a slump at home. Arline pouting in a pile at the beach. It takes the suspense out of turning the page.  Which is all to say that my mother arrived at the office of the endocrinologist in a mild state of ecstasy. For the next year-and-a-half, she took an orange pill morning and night. A bevy of male doctors tracked her for signs of puberty. She had a few migraines, presumably from the hormones, and went into express puberty, gaining 30lb in a year, as dutifully documented in the baby book&apos;s accompanying weight chart. Her growth curve, previously a gentle sinusoidal arch, suddenly flatlined. And then treatment ended abruptly. She was 5ft 11\u00bein, thrilled to have dodged the 6ft bullet.  Of course, she was still tall, towering five inches over the 5ft 7in Jacqueline Onassis, then considered statuesque. She puts it shortly: &quot;My height was my biggest problem, it defined who I was, and it was defined negatively.&quot; She grew into an adult who &quot;dreams of being 5ft 5in&quot;. She wore beige and navy, and never donned a hue that you might see in, say, a rainbow - nor heels, ever. (The goal is to be shorter, not pretty.) If she could become the wallpaper, she would.  Which is how I came to visit the endocrinologist annually from the age of three. She wanted me to have the option, because for her it had been &quot;among the best things I&apos;ve ever done&quot;. For a decade I went as a matter of course. I thought everyone had an endocrinologist, like a dentist for your growth. Just bone scans instead of tooth X-rays.  The skeleton details of why I was there were revealed to me when I was 11. Which is how I found myself facing Dr Kauger, my mother, and the question: &quot;So what height would you like to be?&quot; I had six months to decide, because the pills must be started before puberty. I peered over Dr Kauger&apos;s shoulder, tracing my curve to its end: 6ft 3in. Way above all the other growth curves. My mother sent me to the waiting room so she could talk with Dr Kauger. I thought things over. I was having a hard time framing my height positively. The week before I&apos;d attended a social, a dance-cum-hangout where 11-year-olds gossiped in the basement of my school alongside pool tables and a long mahogany bar that served root beer and ginger ale. I arrived early and lingered in a corner for a while in my signature stance, the hip drop. Nothing is more unattractive than the hip drop. The room lacked chairs (no one can work a chair like a tall girl), so I hovered awkwardly, towering above the cliques, unable to hear the girls and drawing zero interest from the boys.  When my hips started to ache, I awkwardly strolled my 5ft 7in self around the room, passing Katie and Justin, a year older, at a pool table. My brain has blocked out the precise phrasing of what they said, but the gist was: &quot;No one likes you, you look like a giraffe, and no boy will ever date you.&quot;  The problem with tall teasing is that, unlike most teasing, it&apos;s 100% accurate. I really did look like a giraffe. And no boy on the premises would even consider dating me. So obviously they were right.  At least my mother was on my side. She had smartly overloaded my schedule with activities where height was an asset - tennis, dance, swimming.  In Dr Kauger&apos;s waiting room, I watched adorable chemo-stunted boys and girls play below walls muralled with giraffes. Children&apos;s illustrators often employ giraffes as a neutral mascot of difference. &quot;Because of its height, the giraffe has long been a symbol of people who just don&apos;t fit in,&quot; writes Lynn Sherr, the tall American news anchor who was so intrigued by her own lifelong association with giraffes that she took time off to write a book about them, Tall Blondes. &quot;They may be too tall or too eccentric, or simply too different from everyone else, like exclamation points on the landscape.&quot; An exclamation point. That is exactly. What. I felt like! I was the sort of child who read the op-ed page, so I thought that perhaps there might be a book to help me make my decision. That afternoon I went to the library. The card catalogue said, &quot;Tall: see Giraffe&quot;. No mention of &quot;oestrogen&quot; or &quot;height-reduction treatment&quot;. From Memily, by children&apos;s writer Stephen Cosgrove: &quot;Week after week, Memily grew and she became sadder and sadder. She was shy and embarrassed by her height, and whenever any of the other creatures walked by she would turn her head, knowing that they had to look up just to look her in the eye.&quot; Memily develops a severe slouching problem. So did I. But Memily, apparently, was never offered oestrogen therapy. So I had to make the decision alone. My thinking had little to do with height and more to do with a general aversion to medication: when in doubt, don&apos;t take chemicals. At the time, it was simply a decision of passivity. I was frozen. Though I wasn&apos;t happy with my body, I didn&apos;t want to change it. I told myself that the fastest swimmers in the world were six-footers. Long limbs were important. So I decided to not do anything. I figured I&apos;d just wait and see what happened.  What happened is I ended up on the couch of therapist Diane, my gawky 17-year-old limbs sprawled awkwardly. My mother sent me as a precautionary measure, concerned that I wasn&apos;t talking much. But really, I just didn&apos;t want to talk about my life as an exclamation point. I mean, what was there to say? Boys ignored me. My closest resemblance was to Big Bird. There wasn&apos;t enough happening to fill light pleasantries, let alone an hour of analysis.  So we talked about my mom. This is what therapists do: untangle women from their mothers. One day I announced that I didn&apos;t think my familial height was particularly feminine. Diane gamely insinuated that perhaps this was just one perception. Mine.  She asked me how I felt about my body. I looked down at myself on the couch, lean and tanned from hours of daily swimming. As bodies go, even then, mine sort of did what it&apos;s supposed to do. Length is a great friend of thighs and tummies - it stretches them, taking the eye away from the bulges. And I could wear pretty much any style - glam, boho, sporty, chic. Tallness is, objectively speaking, gorgeous. Tallness, by definition, can only be awkward when there are shorter bodies nearby. You see it at basketball games: the 6ft 5in athlete looks ethereal in her own space, all grace and long angles. And then the 5ft 5in teammate comes into the frame, and suddenly she looks like Hulk. Or the shorter teammate looks like Humpty Dumpty. Ditto on catwalks when the designer appears. Sitting on the couch alone was great. &quot;So,&quot; Diane asked, &quot;where&apos;d you get the idea that you weren&apos;t feminine?&quot;  The true challenge of tall life is not that you&apos;re tall. Who cares about that - legs are legs. The challenge is that everyone can see you, all the time. Eyes follow everywhere you go. You&apos;re public. On display. There is no hiding. Learning to love yourself has nothing to do with the blather you see in women&apos;s magazines about treating your body as a temple - it&apos;s learning to accept the high-wattage spotlight that came packaged with your body, always shining on you. I can tell you what it feels like to resist: like a non-performer pushed on stage, day after day. The giraffe in the room. Shortly after college, I headed for a journalism job in Cambodia, one of the shortest countries in the world, where men average 5ft 4in, and women below 5ft. If you want to know why I chose Cambodia, I can only say that I had just spent four undergraduate years at Harvard, where students are quite tall, and I&apos;d melded in for the first time. Thus, height wasn&apos;t on my mind when I chose my next step.  I spent much of my time in Phnom Penh attending press conferences where I walked in to find 50 men and 20 cops milling around, the tallest of whom reached my armpit. All stared. I never figured out how to manage this situation.  I was the tallest person anyone had ever seen. Taller than the locals, taller than the expatriates. I assumed that after months of frequenting the same markets with the same saleswomen, they would eventually get over it. Never happened. Every time I entered a market or passed any Cambodian, I ran a 75% chance of hearing, &quot;Bpee metres!&quot; (&quot;Two metres!&quot;) followed by a swift sucking in of breath.  I was considered so tall, and therefore exotic, that I didn&apos;t get a gender - I was just an enormous barang (foreigner), a sort of \u00fcber-large white mutant.  Tall hazards are never quite what you expect. One Monday I awoke in Phnom Penh with a bit of stomach pain and soon found myself on a plane to Bangkok General for an emergency appendectomy. The surgery went smoothly and I landed in an extra-long bed on the Foreigner Floor. A nurse handed me my belly-button ring, which had apparently caused 15 minutes of operating room commotion.  The resident English-speaking doctor, the green-turbaned Dr Singh, explained that my surgery had been successful. Then he informed me that they had found an &quot;unspecified mass&quot; on my pancreas. He wanted to let me rest and then perform another CAT scan the following day, focusing on the pancreas. He also ordered blood work to look for tumour markings. He held up an MRI image of my pancreas and pointed to where it should end. Mine extended 6in past his finger. He said it could just be inflammation, but that he&apos;d asked the nurses not to mention it. I knew perfectly well that pancreatic tumours are bad news. The five-year survival rate is 3%. But I consoled myself with the freeflowing morphine and the knowledge that I would have an answer soon.  While I pondered the fact that I was potentially dying of pancreatic cancer, Dr Singh took a five-day trip to China. I was put on the Foreigner Diet, which consisted of cream of corn soup breakfast, cream of chicken soup lunch and, one night, cream of cream. Then the CAT-scan machine broke. Despite this, too-young nurses starved me every night in preparation for morning CAT scans that never materialised. I was so bored that I watched Showgirls in Chinese. When you think you have a terminal illness at 23, this is what you do: first, you want to wave a wand to make your problems go away. You poke at your pancreas, and wonder why you can&apos;t just reach through the skin and fix it. Then you remind yourself that you will never have sex again, and that the rest of your life will be painful, boring and short. It was over.  On day seven, a relaxed-looking Dr Singh appeared.  I was very hungry, having fasted yet again. He was smiling: &quot;Good news, your CAT scan was fine. You do not have a pancreatic tumour.&quot;  I tried to convey my best &quot;I just spent eight days contemplating my own death&quot; look. He explained that in the basement the radiologists review the X-rays and scans, and they have little charts glued to the wall telling them how many centimetres each organ should be. &quot;My dear, as you know, you are very tall. So, I think that maybe they looked and thought your pancreas was very large for a Thai person. You probably had a bit of pancreatitis, too, but you are OK now.&quot;  I glared.  &quot;You do not have a tumour, my dear,&quot; he smiled. &quot;You are just very tall.&quot; Cambodia was my one respite from giraffes. Southeast Asians don&apos;t really know what they are. But had I known what I know now about giraffes, I would have missed their presence in my life. Giraffes are tall, laid-back creatures of the highest order: polysocial, known for hanging out in any number or gender combination, the cool lunch table. They stand lookout among the zebras and wildebeests and ostriches, and get along with the entire savannah. They are anything but outcasts. Giraffes come in all the hair colours I have tried - red, black, brown and blonde - and their hooves are the size of dinner plates, their eyes wider than a spread hand. The word comes from the Arabic zarafa, which means to hurry, something at which they are more awkward than the most awkward tall person you&apos;ve ever seen. They move both right legs and then both left legs to prevent tangles. At 18ft tall, their ability to get a drink and not black out is studied by Nasa scientists. They are nuts for routine. If the daily schedule changes, they turn into Rainman.  Our interest in them is intriguing, because giraffes are one of those rare creatures that serve no purpose to us. We can&apos;t eat them or make clothes out of them or use them for labour. They&apos;re not even all that entertaining (see: penguins). Basically, we like them because they&apos;re tall.  I saw this during my brief stint as one half of America&apos;s tallest couple, with my 7ft 2in partner, Alan. It was important for me to see someone else&apos;s experience of extreme height. We met at the European Tall Club convention, where I&apos;d gone to report for my book. As I watched people interact with him, what I saw was that people really loved him. Toddlers make a beeline for him; adults want to sit at his table; friends sort of burrow into his side; at parties, the space next to him is always filled. He gets a lot of hugs. From everyone. Men, women, children, the elderly. They could never say why. I found the answer in a 1969 book on giraffes by CAW Guggisberg: &quot;Humans are awed and deeply stirred by anything that is big. A monumental building, a big ship or a towering mountain all give us a thrill.&quot; People love tall. I didn&apos;t believe it until I saw it with my own eyes.  In researching The Tall Book, I found that, without fail, children absorb their parents&apos; feelings about their height. Just as one learns from one&apos;s parents a suitable wedding gift and what appropriate make-up and jewellery looks like, one also finds one&apos;s adult self-ingrained with a sense of what bodies are appropriate. And I sensed that to be tall was not appropriate.  Susie Orbach puts it differently: &quot;If parents are tall and uncomfortable, then children will feel that part of being tall is to be out of sorts, to be peculiar in some way. So they will feel like they are ill-fitting in a profound sense.&quot; Which is how I ended up at the European Tall Club Convention, on the arm of the one man who negated any sense that I was on display - more than any other man on earth. When we went for walks, people either stared at him or at my dog. In my journal I wrote, &quot;Ignored again! Fascinating!&quot; I had never dated anyone shorter than me. I spent my time seeking out the 3% of men taller than me, who by definition made me not tall. I was alerted to the error of my ways while interviewing love and relationship expert Dr Betty Dodson. When I told her I only dated up, she exclaimed, &quot;You&apos;re prejudiced! I mean, come on! Develop a sense of humour! It will help. Look in the mirror and say, &apos;God damn, we&apos;re a weird-looking couple.&apos; And then shut it off.&quot;  This was among the most life-changing advice I&apos;ve ever received. Because she&apos;s not talking about height. She&apos;s talking about the way in which we all unwittingly corner ourselves by whittling down our options. Perhaps you only date or befriend people who are your ethnicity, or are overly educated, or in a certain field. And suddenly, just like that, 90% of your pool disappears.  Height makes a great case study, because height statistics are easily quantifiable. Tall women have half the birth rate of shorter women. &quot;It&apos;s not related to lower fertility,&quot; says anthropologist Boguslaw Pawlowski, the pre-eminent mating patterns researcher. &quot;It&apos;s the same with short guys. They are not limited by sperm quality or hormone level - they&apos;ve got problems with finding a partner.&quot; In the population at large, women typically date men who are 8% taller. This is a boon for the women below the 50th percentile, who have 99 per cent of men to choose from. A 6ft 3in woman is looking at less than 3% of the male population. Extrapolate freely to the choices you make in your own life.  I had six months with Alan to let Dodson&apos;s words marinate before the relationship imploded. The truth was that despite getting along famously, we had little in common. No tall joke could save us. And in the two years since, I haven&apos;t kissed anyone taller than me. Don&apos;t get me wrong, they&apos;re still tallish - the 6ft DJ, the 5ft 11in triathlete, the 6ft 1in actor. But my dating pool has expanded by 3,000%. I&apos;m happier. Giraffes have incredible vision, able to identify people or animals a mile away. This is also metaphorically true. To be different is to see more. And I saw that perhaps I should look slightly downward from time to time.  I did, and a whole new world opened up - one a little closer to the ground.", "publicationDate": "2009-05-30T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Health & wellbeing", "Women", "Life and style", "Health, mind and body", "Books"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/may/31/arianne-cohen-books", "title": "Writer Arianne Cohen on the highs and lows of being 6ft 3in", "sentences": ["One Monday I awoke in Phnom Penh with a bit of stomach pain and soon found myself on a plane to Bangkok General for an emergency appendectomy."]}, {"article": "     Samantha Orobator, the pregnant London woman arrested on drug trafficking charges in Laos last year, was jailed for life today after a brief trial in the capital, Vientiane. She is likely to be allowed to serve her sentence in the United Kingdom, following the signing of a prisoner transfer treaty by both countries last month. Orobator, 20, from Peckham, south London, avoided a potential death sentence on the grounds of her pregnancy. The Lao authorities required her to sign a statement before her trial saying that she had not been raped or sexually abused while in custody. Her baby is due in September and she was arrested last August. A Foreign Office spokesperson confirmed the sentence and British consular officials from Bangkok were present in court for the hearing. &quot;We will be in contact with her to discuss her options,&quot; said a spokesperson. It is possible that she will be able to fly back to the UK before the end of the month. Although Orobator has been sentenced to life, she may be eligible for release in the UK after a few years, as it is her first offence and a defence of duress has been advanced. Orobator was stopped at Wattay international airport just outside the capital and her luggage searched last August. Inside her case, officials found 0.68 kg (1.5lb) of heroin, an amount that brings a charge of trafficking rather than possession under Lao law. She initially denied that the drugs were hers. She was taken to the Phonthong prison, which human rights groups suggest provides a low standard of care. Attempts by the human rights group Reprieve to have a private meeting with her were rebuffed by the Lao authorities. Orobator&apos;s mother, Jane, who lives in Dublin with three of her other children but has been in Laos for the last two weeks, said her daughter appeared to be in good health. Earlier she said that for her daughter to be involved in drugs trafficking was &quot;totally out of character&quot;. &quot;She is very fragile, just a little thing,&quot; she said.

The first, and biggest, of his career peaks came with the television series Kung Fu (1972-75), a huge cult hit, mixing western action with eastern philosophy - a long and abiding interest for the actor - in a way that was novel at the time. His character, Kwai Chang Caine, was a Shaolin monk wandering the American west. It was a sad irony that Carradine was to die in the Buddhist centre of Bangkok, Thailand, in what is believed to be a suicide. Originally a TV movie, Kung Fu grew into a show that lasted for 46 episodes. By the time the series began, Carradine was already 36. After leaving San Francisco State College, he had been a soldier, commercial artist and stage actor. He had appeared in Shakespearean rep and on Broadway, notably in Royal Hunt of the Sun (1965), as the Inca chief Atahualpa. From the early days, he played a variety of races, and his counter-cultural credentials were established with roles in Martin Scorsese&apos;s first film, Boxcar Bertha (1972), and (uncredited) in the director&apos;s celebrated Mean Streets (1973) as a memorable drunk in a ruckus in a bar.  A co-star in the former was Barbara Hershey, his partner in the Kung Fu days. This was a hippie affair - she changed her name to Barbara Seagull, and their child was named Free. They never married, but Carradine was to wed five times. There were two other children and four divorces before his final wife, Anne Bierman. Though he was born John Arthur Carradine in Hollywood, the name David distinguished him from his actor father John Carradine, a grand old man of Hollywood who claimed to have appeared in more movies than any contemporary. David was his eldest son. When Walter Hill came to make The Long Riders, a 1980 film about the James and Younger gangs, he drew on four different acting families. David topped the bill as Cole Younger, alongside his half-brothers, Keith and Robert.  Carradine&apos;s career took in more than 200 film and TV credits. He started mainly in westerns, playing the title role in a series based on the hit film Shane in 1966. Other memorable movies included Robert Altman&apos;s radical reworking of The Long Goodbye (1973, again uncredited), and the lead in the exploitation film Death Race 2000 (1975), also starring Sylvester Stallone. He was nominated for a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Woody Guthrie in Bound for Glory (1976), which also showcased his abilities as a singer, a talent shared with his brother Keith, who played a country singer in Nashville (1975).  David was in Ingmar Bergman&apos;s The Serpent&apos;s Egg (1977), but his star waned after the 1970s, assisted by a gonzo reputation. In 1989 he served 48 hours in jail for drink-driving. Q: The Winged Serpent (1982) gave him a rare interesting part, and he appeared in 12 episodes of the TV mini-series North and South (1985-86), which brought him another Golden Globe nomination. He was to revisit his Kung Fu character again from time to time, in Kung Fu: The Movie (1986) and the TV series Kung Fu: The Legend Continues (1993-97). &quot;Every day,&quot; he once said of the role, which won him several Emmys, &quot;at least six people will come up to me and say &apos;Your show changed my life&apos;.&quot;  The actor also turned his hand to directing, initially on the Kung Fu series and in three other feature films, You and Me (1975), Mata Hari (1978) and Americana (1983). But his career had been in the doldrums for some time when the celebrated occupation-reviver Quentin Tarantino cast him in the title role of Kill Bill, Vol 1 and 2 (2003-04), a demonic character that leaned heavily on a screen personality that was freewheeling, laconic, always tending towards the maverick outsider. Carradine said it was as close to him as any part he had played, and it provided him with another onscreen musical number, The Legend of Pai Mai. The director had thought of him for some time: &quot;He wanted it to be a revelation to the world that he would show me like people don&apos;t know me,&quot; Carradine explained.

The pictures, which were published in the Thai Rath tabloid, show the Kill Bill and Kung Fu star in the Bangkok hotel room where he died. Thai police said they were almost certainly leaked crime scene photographs. Carradine&apos;s body was discovered on Thursday morning hanging in a wardrobe in his luxury suite at Bangkok&apos;s Swissotel Nai Lert Park hotel. Police say he was naked and had a cord around his neck. In a statement, Carradine&apos;s half-brother, actor Keith Carradine, said the family was &quot;profoundly disturbed&quot; by the publication of the pictures. &quot;The family wants it understood that, per attorney Mark Geragos, any persons, publications or media outlets will be fully prosecuted for invasion of privacy and causing severe emotional distress if the photos are published,&quot; it read. Carradine, 72, had arrived in Thailand two days before his body was found to start work on a new film, Stretch. Thai police have suggested his death may have been as a result of suicide, and say interviews with hotel staff and surveillance footage have led them to believe the actor was alone when he died. However, Carradine&apos;s family believe there may have been suspicious circumstances.  Geragos said an independent pathologist would examine Carradine&apos;s body when it arrived back in the US. The results of the initial Thai autopsy are not expected to be published for at least three weeks. The family have contacted the FBI with regard to Carradine&apos;s death, but the agency does not usually involve itself in an overseas case unless there is clear evidence to suggest a crime has been committed. The Hollywood Reporter said at the weekend that Carradine&apos;s death had forced producers of another forthcoming project, the indie drama Portland, to recast the role he was due to take. Principal photography had been due to start imminently in Portland, Oregon, Los Angeles and along the Pacific coast. &quot;Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time,&quot; executive producers Adrian Salpeter and Elizabeth Levine of Vancouver-based Random Bench Productions said in a statement.", "publicationDate": "2009-06-08T10:25:36Z", "tags": ["David Carradine", "Film", "US news", "Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/08/david-carradine-body-photograph-thailand", "title": "David Carradine's family threaten action over 'leaked crime scene' photos", "sentences": ["The pictures, which were published in the Thai Rath tabloid, show the Kill Bill and Kung Fu star in the Bangkok hotel room where he died.", "Carradine&apos;s body was discovered on Thursday morning hanging in a wardrobe in his luxury suite at Bangkok&apos;s Swissotel Nai Lert Park hotel."]}, {"article": "Thomas Clay is the talented and perhaps even brilliant British film-maker who caused a stir three years ago at Cannes with his debut feature, The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael - an utterly confident, harrowing and finally repulsive movie. I found its technique mesmeric, but was unreconciled to its final scene of arthouse-extreme rape, part of a continuing macho-realist tendency of male directors subjecting female characters to sexual assault at the very end of a highbrow film. Last year, Clay returned to Cannes with a second film, which is only now getting a UK release: a mysterious, hallucinatory and weirdly enthralling metaphysical essay. It is defiantly unBritish and unparochial, and produced entirely outside the media radar-sweep of the British industry and its public funding bodies. With boldness and entrepreneurial flair, Clay made this in Thailand and, in doing so, fascinatingly absorbed the influence of Thai film-makers such as Joe Weerasethakul and Pen-ek Ratanaruang. Soi Cowboy takes its name from a red-light zone in Bangkok, and it is a thoughtful and disquieting poetic meditation on the Thai experience of globalisation and its complex relationship with foreigners or &quot;farangs&quot;. The film is provocative, and there is one scene of violence that is obliquely rendered, but the film has an elusive, Lynchian dreaminess that will not allow for any easy interpretative pinning-down. The action is initially filmed in a dull black and white: a fat westerner (Nicolas Bro) and his Thai girlfriend (Pimwalee Thampanyasan) live a torpid life in their claustrophobic Bangkok flat. Long takes and extended &quot;real-time&quot; cinematography - from Weerasethakul&apos;s cameraman, Sayombhu Mukdeeprom - follow the couple around as they get on each other&apos;s nerves in a non-serious way. The man, evidently a film-maker, slopes off to the supermarket or the mall to buy Viagra or a piece of inexpensive jewellery. The woman hangs out in the apartment playing video games. Nothing much happens. Yet the woman has a complicated family background. We see her telling her brother that she expects her boyfriend to marry her soon and pay a &quot;sin sot&quot;, or dowry, of 150,000 baht. This brother is a gangster working for a sinister Bangkok figure called &quot;uncle&quot;. As the movie moves into its second act, it shifts weirdly into colour (a structural flip-over reminiscent of Weerasethakul&apos;s Tropical Malady) and we follow him as he carries out an awful errand: he must carry out a hit for a promised bounty of 150,000 baht, money his employer has earned from the bar-girl industry.  Later we see the man and girl from the first act reappear in a kind of nightmarishly ambiguous alternative-universe vision in uncle&apos;s bar, this time as prostitute and typical sleazeball customer. That repeated, parallel figure of 150,000 baht gestures at some spiritual selling-out in Thailand&apos;s relationship with the west - or perhaps Clay&apos;s movie-parable can&apos;t be reduced to these terms.  Either way, this is a fascinatingly distinctive, intelligent movie from a director uncompromisingly insistent on cinema as an art form.", "publicationDate": "2009-06-11T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Drama", "World cinema", "Film", "Culture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/12/film-review-soi-cowboy", "title": "Film review: Soi Cowboy", "sentences": ["Soi Cowboy takes its name from a red-light zone in Bangkok, and it is a thoughtful and disquieting poetic meditation on the Thai experience of globalisation and its complex relationship with foreigners or &quot;farangs&quot;.", "The action is initially filmed in a dull black and white: a fat westerner (Nicolas Bro) and his Thai girlfriend (Pimwalee Thampanyasan) live a torpid life in their claustrophobic Bangkok flat.", "This brother is a gangster working for a sinister Bangkok figure called &quot;uncle&quot;."]}, {"article": "Winning tip: Cilento, Salerno, Italy The Nido della Luna agriturismo, owned by farmer Rafaello, lies at the foot of Mount Bulgheria.

The due diligence \u2013 inspection of the books and the business \u2013 is going perfectly well, they say, and the deal is on course to complete next month. Portsmouth will then move on to their third overseas owner in just four years, with Fahim following Alexandre Gaydamak and Milan Mandaric into the boardroom at Fratton Park. Fahim&apos;s spokesman, Ivo Ilic Gabara, emphasised that the deal &quot;will comply with Premier League rules&quot;. They now require shareholders with 10% or more of a club to be named \u2013 only those with 30% or more, and directors, have to pass the &quot;fit and proper person&quot; test. &quot;Al Fahim Asia Associates, the body negotiating to buy Portsmouth, has from the beginning been aware of the need to inform the Premier League of investors with more than 10% of the shares,&quot; Gabara said. &quot;Thaksin Shinawatra, as he has stated, has never been involved.&quot; Thaksin&apos;s participation has been rumoured from the beginning because the introduction of Fahim to Portsmouth was made by Pairoj Piempongsant, a deal-maker based in Dubai and Bangkok, who was for years an adviser to Thaksin. Pairoj was a Manchester City director while Thaksin owned the club, and last August he found Thaksin the deal to sell City to Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi, in which Fahim acted as Mansour&apos;s representative. When Fahim, a Dubai property developer, declared he was bidding for Portsmouth, and Pairoj&apos;s involvement emerged, the rumours fired up that Thaksin, believed to live mostly in Dubai now, and who was paid \u00a3150m for City in that country, must be behind it. Thaksin was passed &quot;fit and proper&quot; to buy City in June 2007 despite longstanding human rights abuse allegations and corruption charges against him, and with his assets frozen by the Thai authorities. But after being convicted of those offences in Thailand, he would no longer pass and has been refused entry to the UK. Thaksin himself declared this week, on the Arabian Business website, that he is close to Fahim and has given advice over the Portsmouth bid, but is not involved himself. &quot;As a result of the [Manchester City] sale, I naturally became acquainted with Dr Sulaiman al-Fahim,&quot; Thaksin wrote. &quot;He is a businessman I greatly admire, and ... I consider him a close friend. Earlier this year he told me he was looking to invest in a Premier League club himself. I gave him some advice and wished him well \u2013 that was the end of the conversation. It is correct that some of my associates may have helped with the introductions for Dr Sulaiman. Why not? I know a lot of people in soccer, and was more than happy to pass on any contacts I could. That doesn&apos;t make them investors. Again, I am not involved, nor are my associates.&quot; The Premier League chairman, Sir Dave Richards, has been challenged over why he met Fahim privately before the Champions League final in Rome on 29 May, apparently to give advice about the takeover. The Premier League, however, has said there was nothing irregular in this, and last week a more formal meeting was held between Fahim&apos;s representatives, Richards and Mike Foster, the league secretary. Gabara stated this week that Pairoj is not an investor, nor are any of the Abu Dhabi royal family, which could have posed a problem given Mansour&apos;s ownership of City. Fahim, as yet, has not named the potential investors, however, fuelling the speculation. Al Fahim stated initially that his newly formed vehicle, Al Fahim Asia Associates, would buy Portsmouth, and that the money &quot;has been raised through the network of Falcon Equity from Asian and Middle Eastern investors.&quot; Falcon Equity is an investment fund based in the low tax financial centres of Switzerland and Jersey, of which Al Fahim himself is the non-executive chairman. After that, he said that Al Fahim Asia Associates will, in fact, be providing the money itself and Falcon are acting only as advisors. Yesterday Holger Heims, Falcon&apos;s managing partner, confirmed that. &quot;Sulaiman Al Fahim will be raising the money,&quot; said Heims. &quot;We are not raising a fund to buy the club. The finance at many Premier League clubs is in flux at the moment, and we are advising particularly on how Portsmouth will be financed after the takeover.&quot; Heims said, too, that the Premier League rules will be complied with. The League insists it does not simply accept bare declarations about who clubs&apos; owners are, and will insist on convincing proof. Yet the focus on whether Pompey&apos;s proposed new owners are &quot;fit and proper&quot;, while important, is a sideshow from the central issue, which is why Premier League clubs are continually up for sale. The test is narrow anyway, barring people from being football club directors or 30% shareholders if they have an unspent criminal conviction. It very rarely applies: Thaksin is freakishly unusual to be rich enough to invest in a club, and have recent convictions. Portsmouth are for sale because it was running at a huge loss, \u00a317m last year, to pay millionaire wages to players Harry Redknapp wanted but the club could not otherwise afford. Peter Crouch complained over the weekend about where the club is heading, with Redknapp, Lassana Diarra and Jermain Defoe all gone, but Crouch, bought for \u00a39m from Liverpool last July, was himself one of Pompey&apos;s gal\u00e1cticos. Gaydamak funded the overspending, with \u00a328m in loans, according to the chief executive, Peter Storrie, but the owner was hit by the economic crisis last year and could no longer fund the shortfalls. Loans and overdrafts owed to Barclays and Standard banks had risen to \u00a344m by 31 May last year, and Standard Bank&apos;s \u00a320m facility was due for repayment this summer. With Gaydamak at his limit, Diarra and Defoe were sold in January to begin balancing the books; the club was facing a summer reckoning. &quot;We&apos;ve lived beyond our means,&quot; Storrie acknowledged of the period which furnished Redknapp with a side to win the 2008 FA Cup. &quot;We were overstretched, particularly with only 20,000 fans in our stadium. It was a risk, but that&apos;s what the Premier League is all about, trying to do better.&quot; Storrie said he knew Pairoj through City, approached him once Gaydamak&apos;s fortune crunched, then Pairoj introduced Storrie to Fahim, in Dubai, as long ago as February. At the time, when Pompey sacked Tony Adams as manager, they were just one point above the relegation zone. Storrie admitted that had they dropped out of the Premier League, the banks would have wanted their full loans repaid. &quot;Things were very worrying and bleak,&quot; Storrie accepted plainly. Fahim, he said, had been waiting to see if they would stay up, and was unlikely to buy if they did not. Storrie insisted, however, that had they been relegated, Pompey would not have collapsed into administration, but only by selling all their major players. Having survived, even if Fahim had not moved in, Storrie said Portsmouth would have had to sell just one player to reduce the debts \u2013 yesterday&apos;s \u00a318.5m agreement with Liverpool over Glen Johnson will ease the pressure. Gaydamak, he added, is writing off around \u00a315m of his loans and will take a price for the club lower than he paid, to cut his losses. If the due diligence goes well, and Fahim and any co-investors have the money, and they satisfy the Premier League&apos;s rules, then Portsmouth will change hands again. Another owner will provide wherewithal to allow the club to live beyond its natural means. Relegation, as Mike Ashley is finding out at Newcastle, is football&apos;s equivalent of a merry\u2011go-round crashing through the floor. But even within the Premier League, the music may just stop one of these days. david.conn@theguardian.com  ", "publicationDate": "2009-06-16T23:05:07Z", "tags": ["Premier League", "Portsmouth", "Manchester City", "Football", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/jun/17/david-conn-portsmouth-takeover", "title": "Portsmouth, takeovers and the fit-and-proper sideshow | David Conn", "sentences": ["&quot;Thaksin Shinawatra, as he has stated, has never been involved.&quot; Thaksin&apos;s participation has been rumoured from the beginning because the introduction of Fahim to Portsmouth was made by Pairoj Piempongsant, a deal-maker based in Dubai and Bangkok, who was for years an adviser to Thaksin."]}, {"article": "A Thai court has dismissed a law suit filed by Tesco against a former MP, Jit Siratranont, for making comments that the supermarket giant&apos;s expansion was at the expense of small retailers.

He backed up the claim with a false degree certificate obtained in Bangkok. In reality Nick has one A level and no degree.

Getting a job can be highly stressful and candidates feel pressure to enhance their achievements to present themselves in the most favourable light. In their book Deception in Selection, Liz Walley and Mike Smith suggest that, in such circumstances, people are pushed to deception in the belief that &quot;everyone else is doing it&quot;. Certainly lying on CVs is on the increase. Surveys suggest as many as a quarter of job seekers deviate from the truth on their CV. The common distortions include bogus or exaggerated qualifications, changing the dates of employment to hide career gaps and exaggerating the pay received in a previous job. Every job-hunter faces the challenge of presenting their qualifications and past experience with as positive a gloss as possible. So just where does harmless exaggeration end and outright deception begin? It is a difficult question to answer, just as it is hard to define what are company perks and what is simple theft. While exaggeration is widespread and generally accepted, it is unwise to resort to outright lies. This is not merely moral advice, it is also expedient. Outright lies such as qualifications or invented jobs will work against you. At best, the cost of lying to future employers is the embarrassment of being found out. At worst, it can cost you the job. Under the terms of the contract of employment, prospective employees are required to tell the truth. A CV acts as a personal history form and if a job offer is made on the basis of information contained in a CV that the employer believes to be correct, then the employer is legally entitled to withdraw the job offer if they discover the CV contains false information. Take the example of a young man recently employed by a major household goods manufacturing company, who discovered this the hard way. He joined the company claiming his previous salary to be 25% higher than it actually was. Yet when the payroll system processed the tax details from his former employer the deceit was uncovered. Four hours after arriving at his desk he was marched from the building. In Deception in Selection, Walley and Smith put forward the theory that job candidates often fabricate an element of their CV in the belief that it will only be a short-term measure. Yet, if not discovered early on, they find it hard to turn back the clock and escape their deception.", "publicationDate": "2009-06-24T09:37:40Z", "tags": ["Guardian Careers", "CVs", "Jobs"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/careers/cv-lies", "title": "Beware of telling lies on your CV", "sentences": ["He backed up the claim with a false degree certificate obtained in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Suzi Gutteridge     New Life wall/floor light.

The Met Office raised its heatwave plan to level three, or amber alert, in London and south-east England, triggering measures designed to help safeguard the welfare of thousands of elderly and other vulnerable people at risk from heat-related conditions. Yesterday was the hottest day of the year to date, with temperatures reaching 31.8C (89.24F) in Wisley, Surrey, as June became the hottest month in three years. The chief forecaster at the Met Office, Eddy Carroll, said: &quot;Temperatures are likely to peak today and tomorrow, reaching 32C before becoming less hot by the weekend as noticeably fresher conditions with the risk of showers push east across the country.&quot; The Department of Health warned that temperatures could be higher tomorrow, touching 33C (91.4F), and advised people with respiratory problems to stay inside during the hottest parts of the day. A heatwave is officially declared when the Met Office confirms that the threshold of an average temperature of 30C by day and 15C overnight for one or more regions has been met and there is a 90% risk that the daytime threshold temperature will be met the following day. Parts of England have seen temperatures climb to highs of around 31C by day and in some areas they have not fallen below 18C at night. The head of health forecasting at the Met Office, Wayne Elliott, said: &quot;There are four key things to try to remember during a heatwave. If possible stay out of the heat during the middle part of the day; cool yourself down; keep your environment cool; and look out for others, especially older people, those living alone and babies and young children.&quot; Yvonne Doyle, the director of public health in south-east England, said: &quot;Everyone&apos;s health can be affected by the heat, with greater risks of dehydration, sunburn, heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Those most at risk are the very young and the very old, and people who already have health conditions, especially heart and respiratory problems \u2013 the heat can make their symptoms worse.&quot; Temperatures in the capital have been higher than in Bangkok this week, and Trafalgar Square&apos;s fountains turned green as algae spread. There is an 80% risk of heatwave conditions in the East and West Midlands and a 70% chance in eastern England. Temperatures are cooler in the north of England, where the chance of heatwave conditions is just 40%. The areas least at risk are Wales, where there is a 20% risk, and south-west England, where there is only a 10% chance of heatwave conditions. Only extreme coastal areas, Northern Ireland and the west coast of Scotland, where temperatures were hitting a more moderate 20C (68F), escaped today&apos;s heat, said a Met Office spokeswoman. Average temperatures for the time of year, which normally hit about 20C, were being surpassed, with most places recording more than 25C (77F), she said. The weather has prompted the government to set up a heatwave advice page on its Directgov website, while the NHS Direct helpline has received hundreds of calls from patients suffering symptoms related to the heat. The London ambulance service said it been treating large numbers of patients for breathing problems, chest pains, loss of consciousness and fainting. The service received 4,765 calls yesterday \u2013 an increase of 21% on the previous Tuesday \u2013 and urged people to call only in a genuine emergency. Staff should be encouraged to wear shorts during the sweltering heat to make work more bearable and prevent them &quot;collapsing&quot; at their desks, the TUC urged. The weather has sent sales of electrical fans and ice cream soaring, according to Tesco and Sainsbury&apos;s. Keepers at London zoo have been feeding gorillas ice blocks, while tapirs at Port Lympne wild animal park near Ashford, Kent, were daubed with suncream by staff yesterday. A London zoo spokeswoman said: &quot;In this really hot weather we give the gorillas ice lollies which we make in buckets.

Dr Michael Baden, who carried out the autopsy at the request of Carradine&apos;s family after the actor&apos;s body was returned to the US from Thailand, said Carradine died from asphyxiation. He said he could not yet determine whether the death of the actor, who had been filming a movie in Bangkok, had been an accident, or a murder. He added that he was still waiting for further information from the Thai authorities which would allow him to make a final decision. &quot;When we&apos;ve spoken to them, they&apos;ve been very cooperative,&quot; he said, adding that his report was consistent with the findings of the Thai doctor who performed the first autopsy, who also said Carradine had died from asphyxiation. The actor&apos;s body was found by a chambermaid at the luxury Swissotel Nai Lert Park hotel hanging in a closet on 4 June. Police say he was naked and had a cord around his neck. Speculation has suggested Carradine, 72, died during an autoerotic sex act, but members of his family believe foul play may have been involved. The Thai police initially said they suspected the actor&apos;s death was suicide, but later conceded it may have been accidental. Baden said autoerotic asphyxiation remained a possible cause of death. Carradine&apos;s family were upset by a graphic photo of the death scene which appeared in a Thai newspaper. Police said it appeared to be a leaked forensics image.

Oxfam International, in a comprehensive look at the expected effects on people of climate change, says some of the world&apos;s staple crops will be hit and the implications for millions could be disastrous . &quot;Climate change&apos;s most savage impact on humanity in the near future is likely to be in the increase in hunger \u2026 the countries with existing problems in feeding their people are those most at risk from climate change,&quot; the report warns. &quot;Millions of farmers will have to give up traditional crops as they experience changes in the seasons that they and their ancestors have depended on. Climate-related hunger [may become] the defining human tragedy of this century.&quot; The report, published as world leaders prepare to meet for the G8 summit in Italy, says that farmers around the world are already seeing changes in weather patterns which are leading to increased ill-health, hunger and poverty. Oxfam staff in 15 countries collected records from communities and observed that: \u2022 Seasons appear to have shrunk in number and variety. \u2022 Rainfall is more unpredictable, tending to be shorter in duration. \u2022 Winds and storms are felt to have increased in strength. \u2022 Unseasonal events such as storms, dense fogs and heavier rains are more common. &quot;Once-distinct seasons are shifting and the rains are disappearing. Poor farmers from Bangladesh to Uganda and Nicaragua, no longer able to rely on centuries of farming experience, are facing failed harvest after failed harvest,&quot; it says. The evidence of changing weather patterns is anecdotal but the results are striking because of the extraordinary consistency they show across the world, said Oxfam programme researcher John Magrath. &quot;Farmers are all saying very similar things: the seasons are changing. Moderate, temperate seasons are shrinking and vanishing. Seasons are becoming hotter and drier, rainy seasons shorter and more violent,&quot; said Magrath. The report, released before the G8 meeting in Italy this week, where Barack Obama will chair a session on climate change, warns that without immediate action on climate all the development gains made in 50 years are under threat. Rice and maize, two of the world&apos;s most important crops, on which hundreds of millions of people depend, face significant drops in yields. Maize yields are forecast to drop by 15% or more by 2020 in much of sub-Saharan Africa and in most of India. The report also documents how rising temperatures are affecting productivity in factories, with manual workers needing longer siesta times and outdoor workers experiencing dehydration. Cities in the tropics are becoming some of the most dangerous places in the world as heat stress increases, it says. The &quot;heat island effect&quot;, where heat retention in concrete and air conditioning combines to raise night temperatures in tropical cities by as much as 10C, can devastate vulnerable populations. &quot;Projections suggest a sixfold increase in heat-related deaths in Lisbon by 2050, and a fivefold increase in Greater London, two to seven times more deaths in California and a 75% increase in deaths among old people in Australian cities.&quot; In Delhi, mortality rates rise by up to 4% with every 1C of temperature rise.

The developing countries want the G8 nations to sign up to a 40% cut by 2020, but that figure is off the radar of the EU and, given the unwieldy legislation laboriously passing through the senate, not a possibility for the US. In important forward steps this week, the G8 agreed to cut its emissions by 80% by 2050 and said worldwide emissions should fall 50% by the same date. However, the value of this pledge has been reduced by the lack of an agreed start date from which the emission cuts should be measured, making it a distant promise. Luis Alfonso de Alba, the lead co-ordinator on climate change for the developing countries at the G8, told the Guardian that their call for a 25-40%cut in developed nations&apos; emissions by 2020 was based on what UN climate change scientists had recommended. The Mexican diplomat gave some ground, saying: &quot;It does not have to be a specific target of 40%. &quot;That is what we hope to achieve, but this is a process of negotiation.&quot; He said a G8 commitment to a 2020 target was &quot;fundamental&quot;, adding: &quot;It is logical that developing countries will commit once they have certainty that developed countries are commiting themselves. &quot;We need to see the mid-term targets go much higher, and we want to see all the developed countries, including the US, move at the same pace. &quot;We still need to see numbers. We respect the internal debate in the US, but it is important for the US to understand that this is a global issue and a multilateral negotiation.&quot; He said developing nations could not &quot;just sit and wait to see what the internal debate in the US resolves&quot;. He insisted the meeting chaired by Barack Obama under the aegis of the Major Economies Forum this week had made progress in accepting common responsibility for the crisis and for the need for carbon emissions to peak. &quot;Climate change is no longer seen as a north-south issue,&quot; he said. &quot;It is no longer a donor recipient relationship. &quot;The most important message is that assuming individual responsibilities to fight climate change can start immediately, and by doing it immediately it will be easier to reach an ambitious agreement at Copenhagen.&quot; De Alba said Mexico had already come up with its own carbon reduction programme, and he expected other developing nations to do the same over the coming months. It was acknowledged at the summit that science dictates world temperatures must not rise more than 2C degrees above pre-industrial levels.

Paris is past it (going to a restaurant shouldn&apos;t be like going to church). London isn&apos;t quite there yet (where&apos;s the street food?). Hanoi, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Shanghai and most major Indian cities will all have their advocates, but is the refinement there? New York is always going to be in with a shout but its great strength is its immigrant cuisines: it lacks an indigenous food culture. Sydney is stuck in the 90s, Lyon in the 1890s, and, as far as I&apos;m concerned, to be a real contender the food roots have to go deep, so that rules out places like Vegas and Cape Town. The market&apos;s nice, but I&apos;ve never had a good meal in Barcelona and though Copenhagen may be flavour of the month, a couple of good restaurants do not a global food capital make. At the risk of alerting John Crace, I have a new book out, &apos;Sushi and Beyond - What the Japanese Know About Food&apos;. So you&apos;d probably expect me to go with a Japanese city, but it&apos;s not Tokyo or Kyoto that I pine for on a daily basis, but Japan&apos;s often overlooked third city, Osaka.I originally went to Osaka on the recommendation of Anton Ego - the restaurant critic in Ratatouille (or rather Fran\u00e7ois Simon of Le Figaro, on whom, rumour has it, Ego was based). I interviewed him a few years back for one of those &apos;Can Paris Still Cut the Mustard?&apos; type pieces (answer - &apos;no&apos;) and was surprised to hear this most chauvinistic of food writers dismiss my adopted home city out of hand, and plump for Osaka instead. I booked my flight soon after and found a city fit to burst with incredible places to eat, from the dazzling depichika basement food halls (the greatest food shows on earth), to the exuberant restaurant quarter of Dotonbori, to the top end places like Kahala, a tiny, exclusive counter restaurant beloved of Tetsuya Wakada.  This is a city entirely at ease with its culinary identity but open to foreign influences (in this case, largely Korean), with several unique dishes, and a population possessed of an admirable gluttony for life. They even have a word for their insatiable gluttony, &apos;kuidaore&apos;, meaning &apos;eat until you burst / go bust&apos;. The city has an irresistible triumvirate of highly addictive, indigenous fast foods: okonomiyaki (thick, filled pancakes, made with yam flour batter, seafood, pork and kimchi); tako yaki (octopus doughnuts); and kushikatsu (deep fried, breaded skewers - invented at the restaurant Daruma, and much loved by Ferran Adri\u00e0, so the chef there told me), each of them slathered in a sweet, savoury, mahogany-coloured sauce. And let&apos;s not forget that kaiten sushi and instant ramen noodles were both invented in the city in the same epochal year (1958 - the latter are rather better than Pot Noodles, I should add).  This is also where you&apos;ll find the world&apos;s greatest (largest, most expensive, best equipped, toughest etc) cooking school, the Tsuji Culinary Institute; and a fish and produce market to rival Tsukiji.

Experts said there is no proof of a Burmese nuclear programme but pointed to worrying signs. The Burmese military has been doing business with a North Korean company that specialises in nuclear technology. The junta has also made suspicious purchases of sophisticated dual-use equipment. A North Korean ship suspected of heading to Burma with an unknown cargo turned back after being shadowed by American warships earlier this month. Finally, reports have emerged of a secret visit by senior Burmese officials to North Korea late last year. &quot;We know that there are also growing concerns about military co-operation between North Korea and Burma, which we take very seriously,&quot; Clinton, the US secretary of state, told journalists in Bangkok. &quot;It would be destabilising for the region. It would pose a direct threat to Burma&apos;s neighbours.&quot; David Albright, the head of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security, which specialises in monitoring nuclear proliferation, said: &quot;There&apos;s no hard evidence, just suspicions right now. We&apos;re watching it.&quot; Albright said one of the principal causes of suspicion was the link between the Burmese military and a North Korean firm, Namchongang Trading Corp (NCG), which is under UN and US sanctions for its role in trading in nuclear technology. NCG set up an office in Damascus, and western officials have alleged the company channelled equipment and materials towards the construction of a nuclear reactor in Syria which was destroyed by an Israeli air raid in September 2007. NCG&apos;s chief executive is Yun Ho-jin, a nuclear expert who was once North Korea&apos;s delegate to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Albright said Burma had also attempted to acquire suspicious technology. &quot;This is hi-tech equipment, capable of making very high precision components. It has other end uses, but it&apos;s hard to see why else Burma would be buying it,&quot; he said. Last month, Japan arrested one North Korean and two Japanese businessmen for attempting to export a magnetometer (a device for measuring magnetic fields) to Burma. Magnetometers can be used in archaeology and geophysics, but they are also a critical component in missile guidance systems. Two years ago, the Burmese junta made an overt attempt to begin a nuclear programme. It signed an agreement with Russian atomic agency Rosatom for the construction of a 10-megawatt research reactor, but the deal stalled, possibly as a result of diplomatic pressure on Moscow. US officials fear Burma may have decided to pursue a covert route through Pyongyang. Earlier this month, a North Korean freighter, the Kang Nam I, which had made previous trips to Burma, was shadowed at sea by the US navy until it reversed course. It remains unclear what its freight was, and US officials were reluctant to board it, fearing it might be an empty decoy designed to embarrass Washington. The Associated Press today quoted a South Korean intelligence expert as saying satellite images suggested the Kang Nam I was carrying equipment for a nuclear programme and Scud-type missiles. Recent reports in Burmese exile media have spoken of a military pact late last year between the two countries, including the construction of underground installations, but the existence of such a pact has yet to be publicly confirmed.", "publicationDate": "2009-07-21T17:00:42Z", "tags": ["Nuclear weapons", "Hillary Clinton", "North Korea", "US news", "World news", "US politics", "Non-proliferation treaty (NPT)", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/21/burma-north-korea-nuclear-clinton", "title": "Burma suspected of nuclear link with North Korea", "sentences": ["&quot;We know that there are also growing concerns about military co-operation between North Korea and Burma, which we take very seriously,&quot; Clinton, the US secretary of state, told journalists in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "No one saw the sun rise in Jiaxing this morning. But no one could miss its disappearance a few hours later. The city, deemed one of the best spots on the globe to view the 21st century&apos;s longest total eclipse, woke to a dull grey haze. Just as the moon edged across the sun, at 8.22am, storms drenched tourists and amateur astronomers who had planned for years and travelled thousands of miles to witness this spectacle. It ceased to matter as the total eclipse began just over an hour later. Sighs of frustration turned to gasps and cheers as the sky darkened second by second and the temperature dropped perceptibly. Behind the solid mass of cloud, the moon was blotting out the sun. It was an eerie reminder of our vulnerability and dependence on a star which burns 93m miles (150m km) away. Across Asia, hundreds of millions of people turned their faces to the skies \u2013 though many had their view marred by clouds and rain. Not until 2132 will there be an eclipse to rival it, according to Nasa. Beginning at dawn over the western coast of India, the shadow of the moon moved east across Nepal, Burma, Bangladesh and Bhutan and then along China&apos;s Yangtze river valley. From there, it carved a path to southern Japan and across the Pacific Ocean, where it reached its maximum length of 6 minutes and 29 seconds. For thousands of years, humans have recorded eclipses. Once, such events were a harbinger of doom: now they fascinate as well as frighten. In Jiaxing, eastern China, thousands of spectators from Europe, Asia and the United States came briefed by experts and armed with viewing glasses, specially adapted telescopes, cameras and video recorders. &quot;It&apos;s frightening because it shows how insignificant we are as a planet,&quot; said Ben McNish, a Southend teenager on a school trip. Five minutes and 56 seconds after the total eclipse began, Jiaxing enjoyed its second dawn of the day. It had been, said one spectator, the shortest night of the year. This time, as the sky lightened, viewers caught intermittent glimpses of an upside-down crescent of sun. &quot;It&apos;s something so great that humans should experience it. It&apos;s not only science. We are Muslim and after this we will go and pray to God together. He has brought us the beautiful sky and earth and sun,&quot; said Dr Mahamarowi Omar, an amateur astronomer who had brought a tour group from Malaysia to see the phenomenon. In India thousands waded into the Ganges in the ancient Hindu holy city of Varanasi, and prayed to the sun in an act believed to bring release from the cycle of life and death. A 65-year-old woman died in the stampede of bathers. But others sheltered indoors as astrologers warned that the spectacle was a bad omen, and expectant mothers asked doctors to induce or postpone births to avoid bad luck for their children. In Thailand dozens of monks led prayers at a Buddhist temple in Bangkok to ward off evil. In China the belief that eclipses herald change survived long after people understood the scientific explanation. &quot;There&apos;s a long tradition of the natural world and human world being interconnected so developments in one speak to the other,&quot; said Professor Jeffrey Wasserstrom, a historian at the University of California, Irvine. &quot;From 2,000 years ago or so, the imperial family was interested in any kind of astronomical knowledge that could help predict eclipses. It&apos;s an early version of spin ... if you knew in advance the heavens were displeased you could interpret that as being about bad officials who needed to be reprimanded as opposed to the dynasty being imperilled.&quot; China&apos;s cabinet \u2013 the state council \u2013 had issued a directive ordering local officials to ensure social stability during the event and urged academics and the media to explain the scientific principles behind it lest it caused blind panic.", "publicationDate": "2009-07-22T14:26:06Z", "tags": ["China", "Solar eclipses", "Science", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/22/solar-eclipse-turnout-china", "title": "A spectacle that inspired awe and fear", "sentences": ["In Thailand dozens of monks led prayers at a Buddhist temple in Bangkok to ward off evil."]}, {"article": "On the posters advertising the Mariinsky Theatre&apos;s production of Wagner&apos;s Ring cycle at the Royal Opera House, you see the image of a man whose a brow is furrowed in mystic contemplation, whose eyes are fixed on an unattainable middle distance, and whose hands are clenched in a fist that denotes virile strength under a surface of intellectual intensity. He is also apparently flame-resistant, as he looms from out from a massive conflagration. So who is this fireproof musical superman? Not Richard Wagner, but conductor Valery Gergiev, whose St Petersburg company are coming to London for their staging of the operatic world&apos;s Everest. The difference between Gergiev&apos;s Ring and all others ever presented at Covent Garden (including the ROH&apos;s own recent cycle, which Antonio Pappano conducted a couple of years ago) is that he&apos;s doing something that only the bravest, or foolhardiest, conductor would ever attempt. Gergiev is playing the whole cycle in just four days. That&apos;s an opera a day. No big deal, you reckon? Just consider the stats: that&apos;s more than 15 hours of music. There&apos;s Das Rheingold (the amuse-bouche of the Ring, at a mere two-and-a-half hours), followed by the four hours of Die Walk\u00fcre and Siegfried, and then there&apos;s the cycle&apos;s concluding operatic behemoth, the five-hour G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung. It&apos;s no wonder opera companies and audiences usually take a week to work through the cycle. Singers, musicians, and listeners need time to digest what they&apos;ve performed and what they&apos;ve heard, as they journey with Wotan, Siegfried and Br\u00fcnnhilde from the heights of passion and ambition to the depths of despair and\u00a0destruction. But that&apos;s not Gergiev&apos;s way. His plan is the operatic equivalent of scaling the high Himalaya without oxygen. In winter. Wearing slippers. And make no mistake, this is Gergiev&apos;s Ring: the first full production of the Ring by a Russian company since 1914, and Russia&apos;s first to be sung in the original German. Gergiev&apos;s name is printed bigger on the posters than Wagner&apos;s. At Wagner&apos;s own theatre in Bayreuth, which he built specifically for performances of his works \u2013 the Ring was premiered there in 1876 \u2013 it&apos;s inconceivable the cycle would be presented as Gergiev is doing it. If you&apos;re lucky enough to be able to get to Bayreuth in your lifetime (put your name down soon \u2013 it takes over a decade to get a seat), you will hear the Ring in six days: the first two parts on consecutive days, with a day off before Siegfried, and another before G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung. It&apos;s an act of conductorly hubris to do it as Gergiev plans. Patrick Carnegy, author of Wagner and the Art of the Theatre, says:\u00a0&quot;It&apos;s crazy. It turns the Ring into a marathon. Playing it like this forgets the fact that this is a piece that has to be played by human beings: millions of notes have to be played by the violins. Doing it like this just means that everyone \u2013 including the audience \u2013 will be absolutely buggered by the end.&quot; But Gergiev has done it before. The Mariinsky Ring has been touring the world for the last three years, and audiences in Cardiff had the chance to see it in 2006, in another four days of total Wagner/Gergiev immersion. The critics hated the production: &quot;More Spinal Tap than Wagner&quot;, said\u00a0the Daily Telegraph; George Tsypin&apos;s designs sent characters to &quot;disco hell with charity-shop props&quot;, according to the Times; &quot;flawed and uneven,&quot; said Rian Evans in this paper. Gergiev himself \u2013 not a man usually wracked by self-doubt \u2013 realised there was a problem, and this time, he&apos;s brought in the 24-year-old Anglo-Russian Alexander Zeldin to direct the staging. &quot;The story wasn&apos;t being told,&quot; Zeldin told the Telegraph, &quot;so it was a question [of] looking at the visual imagery and thinking, where do we go with this.&quot; Ah yes, the visual imagery. In London the production will benefit from new video projections by Sven Ortel, to offset the oppressive impact of Tsypin&apos;s designs, which are dominated by four gigantic statues. The visual language of the production, with its vivid lighting and garish costumes, is all part of Gergiev&apos;s desire to reaffirm the Gods-and-monsters myth of the Ring, as opposed to its abstract, psychological drama. And if the staging realises Gergiev&apos;s desire to connect Wagner&apos;s drama with ancient Slavic myths, there may be hope for this new version to contribute to our understanding of Wagner&apos;s vast operatic canvas. Carnegy puts the Mariinsky staging in the context of the Ring&apos;s performance history: &quot;Wagner was brilliantly successful in the Ring in creating a story that is valid for all ages, and which\u00a0admits infinite interpretations. And\u00a0that&apos;s why you can&apos;t define what theRing\u00a0really is: it&apos;s not a single entity, or a single way of performing it. It&apos;s what Wagner created, plus everything that&apos;s happened to the work since it was first performed \u2013 just as is the case with Hamlet, or the Oresteia.&quot; In Russia, the Ring has had a chequered history. Eisenstein staged Die Walk\u00fcre in 1940, to celebrate the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and Russia&apos;s brief peace with the Nazis. &quot;It was ironic, after years of making films such as Ivan the Terrible, which are basically anti-German, that Eisenstein should have to direct part of the Ring in Moscow,&quot; says Carnegy. &quot;He came up with an anthropomorphic conception, in which there were all sorts of weird creatures, and the scenery moved in sympathy with the characters.&quot; The German delegation, for whom the opera was performed, wasn&apos;t impressed at this Slavification of one of the holy relics of German art. The Ring&apos;s association with the Nazis has been a postwar problem for the piece,\u00a0as it has meant that many German conceptions of the piece are still filtered primarily through the prism of Hitler&apos;s love of Wagner. Carnegy says: &quot;I don&apos;t understand why so many productions in Germany are still trying to exorcise their Nazi past. It&apos;s as if they&apos;re still trying to discredit the Ring and its associations with the Third Reich. I asked some younger\u00a0German directors about this, and\u00a0they said that it&apos;s still important to cleanse Wagner&apos;s operas of Nazism, because the younger generation don&apos;t know how close Hitler was to Wagner&apos;s music, and if you don&apos;t do that, people will be in danger of overvaluing the operas.&quot; Instead of Bayreuth&apos;s annual productions now holding the key to Wagner interpretation, as they did in the 60s and 70s, Carnegy sees stagings in far-flung parts of the world rejuvenating the Ring. &quot;Go to Seattle or anywhere on the west coast of America: they do guilt-free Wagner over there. The dark history of Europe is half a world away, and the Nazi appropriation of the operas just doesn&apos;t interest them. They have a much more direct route back to the other meanings of the Ring.&quot; The same is true of recent stagings in Bangkok or Australia. So will the Mariinsky Ring be part of this brave new world of Wagnerian productions? &quot;I&apos;m suspicious of Gergiev&apos;s motives,&quot; Carnegy says. &quot;In the old days at Bayreuth, the conductor was never advertised, but now it&apos;s all about the glorification of the man with the baton, as if he was climbing Everest alone, and never mind the bloody sherpas!&quot; The Ring in London will either be the consummation of Gergiev&apos;s Wagnerian dreams \u2013 or the immolation of his ambition.", "publicationDate": "2009-07-23T23:05:30Z", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "Opera", "Valery Gergiev", "Richard Wagner"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/24/gergiev-marathon-ring-cycle-london", "title": "'It's crazy': Gergiev's marathon Ring Cycle comes to London | Tom Service", "sentences": ["They have a much more direct route back to the other meanings of the Ring.&quot; The same is true of recent stagings in Bangkok or Australia."]}, {"article": "A pilot was killed and 34 people injured, including two Britons, when a Bangkok Airways flight skidded off a runway and hit a flight control tower on the Thai island of Koh Samui today.

A Laos foreign ministry spokesman, Khenthong Nuanthasing, said that Orobator&apos;s return was a humanitarian gesture that took her pregnancy into account. Orobator was to fly to Bangkok and change planes for a flight to London. British officials had been pressing for the transfer, concerned that she was in the late stages of her pregnancy. She will be 36 weeks pregnant on 12 August, after which she would likely be unable to take an international flight. Her mother, Jane Orobator, said: &quot;I just want her to come back to the UK, that is my first desire. One step at a time, I just want her to have her baby here.&quot; Orobator, whose case attracted attention because of her conception behind bars in a women-only unit, is the first British inmate to benefit from a diplomatic protocol signed last month. She was caught last August at the capital, Vientiane&apos;s, Wattay airport with more than 0.6kg (1.3lb) of heroin, well above the amount that carries the death sentence. Orobator, who moved from Nigeria to south London aged eight, was sentenced to life in June after conceiving in Phanthong prison in January. Another British drug smuggler in the jail, John Watson, 47, has been named as the father but neither has confirmed the child was conceived after a sperm transfer in the visitor&apos;s area of the jail.

The Russian, nicknamed &quot;the merchant of death&quot;, has been held in a maximum-security prison in Bangkok since his arrest there in March last year during a sting operation by US agents. The US said it was &quot;disappointed and mystified&quot; by today&apos;s ruling. It has 72 hours to appeal against the ruling, during which time Bout will remain in detention. If the US does not appeal, he will be set free. Also known as &quot;the embargo buster&quot;, Bout was allegedly attempting to procure weapons for US agents masquerading as Farc rebels from Colombia when he was arrested. He was charged with conspiring to sell millions of dollars in illegal arms to Farc, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by America. Delivering the verdict at Bangkok&apos;s criminal court today, judge Jittakorn Wattanasin said: &quot;The US charges are not applicable under Thai law. This is a political case. The Farc is fighting for a political cause and is not a criminal gang. Thailand does not recognise the Farc as a terrorist group.&quot; US agents had been pursuing Bout for months before they orchestrated the swoop in a Bangkok hotel room after he had flown in from Moscow. &quot;We&apos;re disappointed and mystified by the lower court ruling,&quot; said James Entwistle, deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Thailand. &quot;We will consult the Thai government.&quot; Some analysts suspect Bout has links to Russian intelligence, making him valuable to US authorities. Relations between the US and Russia reached a cold war low in the last year of George Bush&apos;s presidency, which Barack Obama has been attempting to remedy. But in February, Russia&apos;s foreign ministry described the US attempt to secure Bout&apos;s extradition as &quot;embarrassing&quot; and &quot;perplexing&quot;, concluding that the move was politically motivated. Bout&apos;s wife, Alla, commended the judge for not being swayed by diplomatic ties. &quot;I am very happy as the US government has strong political influence in Thailand,&quot; she told reporters. &quot;The judge showed professionalism in this case.&quot; Bout, 42, became notorious in the 1990s when he was accused of illegally smuggling arms to numerous African regimes and conflicts. The United Nations has accused him of arming the former Liberian president Charles Taylor, who is currently on trial for war crimes, as well as rebels in Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. According to UN reports, Bout&apos;s alleged arms smuggling network included more than 50 aircraft around the world. A 2005 report by Amnesty International alleged he was &quot;the most prominent foreign businessman&quot; involved in trafficking arms to UN-embargoed destinations from Bulgaria, Slovakia, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan and other countries. His activities were chronicled in a book, Merchant of Death, published in 2007 by two US investigative journalists. Bout was also the reported inspiration for a 2005 film, Lord of War, in which Nicholas Cage played a cynical arms dealer. Bout has admitted working for his &quot;very close friend&quot; Jean-Pierre Bemba, a warlord who became the vice-president of Congo and is now in The Hague awaiting trial for orchestrating rape, mass murder and the use of child soldiers. Bout has suggested the charges against Bemba are trumped up. Bout has also been accused of arming the Taliban. However, his supposed client list is not limited to notorious warlords; it includes American, British, French and Russian customers. In October 2006, Bush issued an executive order freezing assets belonging to Bout and several associates, and barring Americans from doing business with them. Bout claims to be bankrupt, although one estimate puts his wealth at $6bn (\u00a33.65bn).

For in front of a febrile media throng, a grinning, mustachioed Bout, 42, allegedly the world&apos;s biggest gunrunner, flashed a victory sign as he sauntered from a Bangkok court after a Thai judge refused to extradite him to the United States. Pursued for years by the world&apos;s intelligence services, and tracked for months by US and Thai agents, the &quot;Merchant of Death&quot;, as the former Russian air force officer is known, has once more escaped prosecution, it seems. The US now has three days to appeal. If not, or if any appeal is dismissed, the man whose reputation as the &quot;McDonald&apos;s&quot; of the arms trade inspired the Nicolas Cage character Yuri Orlov in the 2005 film, will walk free. Today&apos;s result was a bitter blow to all who have sought to see Bout face trial. Though the charge sheet accused him of conspiracy to sell millions of dollars of weapons to the leftwing Farc rebels in Colombia, he is alleged to have sold or brokered arms deals in just about every world conflict of the last two decades, charges he has denied. No effort had been spared in trying to trap him. US Drug Enforcement Administration agents set up an elaborate sting to lure him from the safety of his Moscow home, where he lives under the seemingly protective eye of the Russian authorities, to a five-star hotel in Bangkok in March 2008. There, undercover officers posed as arms buyers for Farc, complete with a shopping list said to extend to 700 surface-to-air missiles, 5,000 AK-47 assault rifles, millions of rounds of ammunition, C-4 explosives, landmines and unmanned aerial vehicles. But, there was just one flaw. While America may view Farc as a terrorist organisation, Thailand does not. &quot;The US charges are not applicable under Thai law. This is a political case,&quot; ruled Judge Jittakorn Wattanasin delivering the verdict at Bangkok&apos;s criminal court. &quot;The Farc is fighting for a political cause and is not a criminal gang. Thailand does not recognise the Farc as a terrorist group. We will not extradite him to the United States.&quot; Bout, dressed in faded orange prison uniform, jumped from his seat to embrace his tearful wife, Alla, before being led from the courtroom. &quot;I am very happy,&quot; she sobbed. &quot;The judge showed professionalism in this case.&quot; There was similar sentiment in Moscow. &quot;We view this decision with satisfaction, and we hope that in the nearest future, Viktor Bout will return to the motherland,&quot; Interfax quoted a Russian foreign ministry spokesman as saying. James Entwistle, deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Thailand, said: &quot;We&apos;re disappointed and mystified by the lower court ruling. We will consult the Thai government. We understand they want to file a petition and we support that.&quot; Bout has always denied involvement in the illegal arms trade, saying he is involved only in cargo transportation. As for Bangkok, he was there &quot;to relax&quot; and hold talks with &quot;a Thai businessman who wanted to buy aeroplanes&quot;. A burly six-footer \u2013 he has lost weight in the 18 months he has spent in a maximum security Bangkok prison awaiting the extradition decision \u2013 Bout is a regular fixture on international most-wanted lists. He is the subject of UN sanctions, an Interpol notice over weapons trafficking and money laundering charges in Belgium, and an assets freeze by the US. It was on the back of a crumbling Soviet empire in the early 1990s that he set up business, enthusiastically buying up the ancient Antonov and Ilyushin cargo planes strewn around decaying airfields of former Soviet-bloc countries, as well as the massive stockpile of weapons and spare parts available. His cargoes have ranged from gladioli to diamonds. His supposed client list was once described as a who&apos;s who of the world&apos;s nastiest warlords, and he has been accused by the UN of trafficking arms and breaking arms embargos in hotspots such as Liberia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, and Sudan. In Afghanistan, it is alleged he suppled weapons to all sides; the Northern Alliance, the Taliban and the US. But his clients are also said to include western governments and aid agencies. Business is business. In rare interviews with western media, Bout said had he been in it &quot;just for the money&quot; he would be richer. There is speculation he is worth $6bn, though he has said he is bankrupt. &quot;Heart and mind&quot; dictate his business ventures, he once said. The US had hoped to try him on four separate charges, three of which could land him in prison for life if found guilty.

He then recants the rich brew through another stocking-like filter into a tumbler. He takes an appraising sip and nods. Another cup of kafe boran, or traditional Thai-style coffee, is ready to be served. You can drink it straight or syrupy sweet with lashings of caramel and condensed milk. Lee Sata, or Pae (grandpa) Lee, brews his coffee the way he&apos;s done for the past 72 years \u2013 in the same cramped little coffee shop where he first started serving customers in 1937. Back then he was 14 and coffee was still a novelty in Thailand. These days Bangkok alone has 89 Starbucks. Yet thanks to its old-world charm the elderly Chinese-Thai man&apos;s homemade brew has become a popular curiosity. Coffee lovers from the capital, including the rich and famous, flock to Pae Lee&apos;s simple coffee shop with its six little round tables ringed by wooden stools at Klong Suan market, a century-old riverside bazaar in neighbouring Chach oengsao province. In times past the market serviced boats and crews on their way to Bangkok. Although riverine trade has since diminished, produce-laden dinghies paddled by women in flat-top bamboo-leaf hats still ply the toffee-hued canals clogged with water hyacinth. Pae Lee used to collect fresh rain water in ceramic jars to make his coffee. Nowadays bottled water makes for a more hygienic alternative. Wearing a white singlet, the diminutive coffeemaker greets visitors with a thumbs-up and boyish grin before disappearing into the tiny kitchen with its blackened walls to tend to his saucepans, cooking pots and sock filters. Old customer favourites, he notes, include oliang ice coffee, a blend of coffee, corn and soya beans liberally sweetened before being decanted into a plastic bag of shaved ice to be slurped with a straw on the go. &quot;I didn&apos;t plan to make coffee all my life,&quot; Pae Lee says. &quot;But my shop became popular as a meeting place for the local community.&quot; After seven decades of making coffee, Pae Lee, who was born above the shop and sleeps upstairs, still starts work at 5am.

Poor old Ravi Bopara gets the chop after a torrid series in the hot seat at No3, but he will come back again. Meanwhile Ian Bell, a failure in that spot before his own axing, returns to the position, which hardly engenders confidence. Nor in truth does the selection of Warwickshire&apos;s Jonathan Trott, despite his glut of runs this year, not least a century in his last innings earlier in the week. Trott&apos;s job (at No4 or No5, with a decision yet to be finalised) is to disprove the notion that the climax to a close Ashes series, the outcome of which depends on the result, is no place for a debutant. Kent&apos;s Rob Key, as an old hand \u2013 although one discarded for a while now \u2013 might have been a viable option either at first drop or as an opener, but the temptation to turn back the clock has been resisted not just in his case but in those of Mark Ramprakash and Owais Shah. Perhaps the selectors deserve credit for putting faith in the next generation. There is scarcely a bowler left unselected and the final make-up of the attack will be down to the reading of the pitch, the overhead conditions on the first day and those expected for the remainder of the match. Quite what the pitch will be is a matter of conjecture, of course. According to the Surrey chief executive, Paul Sheldon, there will be &quot;no cooking the books&quot; when it comes to its preparation. If you believe that, you will believe that &quot;Beefy&quot; Botham moonlights on holiday as a Bangkok ladyboy. If someone has not bypassed Sheldon and had a word in the shell-like of The Oval head groundsman, Bill Gordon, then it is a dereliction of duty. If you see Gordon in his local branch of Superdrug, buying up industrial quantities of bikini wax, you will know what it is for. If it is lawn fertiliser, it will be a greentop. No question which England would prefer. Brazilian please, Bill. For England, the equation, if not the solution, is a simple one: to win the Ashes they must win the Test. So they need an attack capable of taking 20 wickets with the backing of sufficient runs from a batting line up that at Headingley \u2013 apart from the lower order \u2013 was flakier than the paint on a boarding-house ceiling. In what was for them a disastrous fourth Test, one of the most lukewarm and brainless performances from an England side in years, they were outplayed from first ball to last in each and every discipline. The batting was clueless against excellent, disciplined bowling and they then bowled like numpties against the most diligent batting. Whatever happened in the first three Tests, the gulf between the sides a week ago was massive. After Leeds, in which even the best performance was barely adequate, something had to give. The status quo of picking precisely the same group of players and hoping they will have the good grace to make amends was not an option. The return of Andrew Flintoff for what he says will be his final Test ensures at least one change to the attack and the prospect of a turner, with the likely inclusion of a second spinner, another. It is to the batting that the selectors&apos; focus will have shifted however. At Headingley, Bopara, Bell and Paul Collingwood, at numbers three four and five, between them failed to make double figures in either innings \u2013 an achievement, if it can be so called, unique in Test history. The prospect of it happening again was something that could not be entertained. Sweeping changes would not serve the purpose but Bopara&apos;s current state of mind meant he had to go. Bell is a lucky boy. This has been a chastening Ashes debut for Bopara, a lad with &quot;attitude&quot; in the modern sense, who has been worked over a treat by the Australians. At Leeds, as well he might, he looked a dejected figure, his unfortunate second-innings first-baller condemning him to the sidelines. He had been, information suggests, a bit quieter than usual. That is not a good sign in one so gregarious. The situation demands someone who is temperamentally sound and \u2013 certainly on the advice of Ashley Giles, a selector but more pertinently the director of cricket at Warwickshire \u2013 Trott has received a ringing endorsement. He was the batting replacement called up to Headingley in place of Flintoff, although he didn&apos;t play. Now he has been placed in the front line. It is a massive ask. At the start of the summer, money would have been placed on Michael Vaughan in such a situation. Key might have fitted the bill, but perhaps as an opener with Strauss, giving a left-right combination to break up bowling lines and moving Alastair Cook to No3, a position in which he batted successfully in seven matches through the summer of 2006, scoring two of his nine Test centuries. If the pitch is to be a turner, Monty Panesar, who is having an indifferent season, must still play. The attack, on a pitch that will be quicker than Cardiff, could be the same, with no Graham Onions or Steve Harmison. If it looks flat, then those two plus Ryan Sidebottom look certain to vie for Panesar&apos;s place.", "publicationDate": "2009-08-14T18:20:49Z", "tags": ["The Ashes", "England cricket team", "Australia cricket team", "Cricket", "Sport", "Jonathan Trott", "Ashes 2009"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/aug/14/england-ashes-squad-oval-test", "title": "Choice of Jonathan Trott and Ian Bell is brave for a must-win final Test", "sentences": ["If you believe that, you will believe that &quot;Beefy&quot; Botham moonlights on holiday as a Bangkok ladyboy."]}, {"article": "Real storiesThe family gappers &apos;Please tell me this isn&apos;t happening,&quot; I prayed as my three-year-old son screamed inconsolably, blood pouring down his face, his two front teeth hanging limply from his mouth. We were in Calangute, northern Goa, a beach resort which lost its charm a couple of decades ago and is now a rather over-developed touristy town for package holidaymakers. The main street was filthy and strewn with rubbish and the odd cow - an additional worry as I ran down it, or rather stumbled down it, with Albie in my arms trying to find a hospital, dentist, anything or anyone who could help. It had only been the usual poolside frolics when baby teeth met dad&apos;s hard head with loud and gory consequences. Then an angel appeared. Actually a charming shopkeeper, who looked at Albie and pointed to a row of hand-painted signs displaying gleaming teeth and various dental instruments, and directed me up a dark and dirty stair well. It was at that point that I turned to my husband Sam and screamed: &quot;I want to go home ... NOW!&quot; But we couldn&apos;t. We had let our house in England out to strangers and were only at the beginning of what was meant to be a year-long, round-the-world family adventure. I had it all figured out: me, my husband and our two young boys were to travel the world and immerse ourselves in various welcoming communities and exotic culture. Before kids and domesticity, I had trekked up mountains, lived in mud huts and slept under the stars on remote islands. I had worked the sarong and headband look to great effect, I knew how to travel and a couple of minor details, like my one- and three-year-old children, weren&apos;t going to stop me now.  Call it a mid-life crisis, call it complete madness, but we had decided a change from our hectic London life was needed. I had just finished a masters degree, Sam was to take a career break, and we had one more year before the kids started school. We were going in search of ...something else. And so we packed up our house and two rather large rucksacks (mercifully now on wheels) and headed off to Heathrow. It felt fantastic: 18 again - except for the two buggies in tow. First stop: Goa. A friend had found a house in Patnem village, south of Palolem. Less the old Portuguese colonial with big verandas that we had hoped for, more three bare rooms, a cold shower and a Baby Belling for a kitchen. But it was right on the beach and at only \u00a35 a night, living with a little less heritage was tolerable. What wasn&apos;t was the monsoon - we were constantly damp and splattered in red mud, and my fantastically light packing meant that we ran out of dry clothes after three days. My mind occasionally wandered to fantasies of plonking the kids in front of CBeebies. Instead we re-read the six children&apos;s books we had brought with us, played spaceship troopers in Indian saris, and danced to the Grease soundtrack - a last-minute addition to my iPod that turned out to be a godsend. We spent day after day trying to entertain them indoors. I had wanted to spend time with my kids but this was ridiculous. Shopping in local shops and markets so we could cook at home had always been my plan, but I had also fondly imagined breakfast at beachside cafes where my children would feast on the best banana pancakes on the planet. However having arrived in October the tourist season hadn&apos;t yet started, and the restaurants were closed. We tried to tempt our boys with idlis and puris at the chai house, but they weren&apos;t keen so we fell back on eggs and that Baby Belling. Eventually we discovered the Fernandez Caf\u00e9 at the far end of Palolem Beach which opened a month before any other. An hour&apos;s broiling trek was rewarded with cold beers and great squid and chips that we munched as we watched fishermen haul in their catch. After a little mental adjustment, I realised that these hitches were a small price to pay for how free we felt. As the sun set over the Indian Ocean we stopped worrying about Albie&apos;s countless mosquito bites and the daily struggle to get Arlo to take the disgusting malaria pills. Life was grand, and eventually it stopped raining too. Then Arlo fell and broke his collar-bone and Albie knocked his two front teeth out. At the hospital, the service was fantastic and the medical equipment efficient and gleaming, despite the dirty stairwells and rustic furniture. For Arlo&apos;s broken collar bone we saw two specialists and were told all would be well in a week - for \u00a37.25. And it turned out there couldn&apos;t be a better place to have a dental problem as Goa was a hotspot for dental tourism. Albie had his teeth stuck back in place and I had mine whitened while we were at it. I realised that as long as I did enormous amounts of deep breathing, managed to stay positive despite daily mishaps and reworked the script of my mid-life fantasy (forget any notion of relaxation), our year-long odyssey could work. Putting my new zen-like approach to the test, we then headed to Vietnam. We had planned a two-month trip from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi, staying in low-budget hotels. This usually meant rooms on the eighth floor or above and no lift.  However, the excitement of arriving somewhere new propelled us down the several hundred stairs and onto the street to face several million mopeds and motorbikes. &quot;When crossing the road, find a gap and go for it, look straight ahead, don&apos;t run and don&apos;t stop,&quot; a friend advised. With two buggies this proved quite a challenge. But we managed. We even started using the motorbike taxis, the days of insisting on car seats were behind us.  After a few days of amazing food, we&apos;d had enough of the hectic city, so we kept moving, to just about every temple, palace and pagoda in the land. We whizzed down sand dunes on plastic sheets with the local kids, crawled through Vietcong tunnels and paddled in sampan boats with cone-hatted grannies around the Mekong Delta. It was utterly fascinating but a little exhausting so our arrival in New Zealand, with huge empty landscapes, was a welcome relief. We set off from Christchurch in our enormous six-berth motorhome for a five-week tour of the South Island, staying in campsites in amazing locations. We parked on wild and deserted beaches and collected mussels for our supper. We camped by mountain lakes where, despite looking like we were ready for nuclear war in our anti-sandfly outfits, we spent the evenings sipping delicious wine and watching the kids run around like dogs finally off their leash. We could go anywhere and the boys thrilled to the cries of &quot;climb aboard&quot; as we headed off in their magic bus to yet another perfect spot. It was stunning, like Scotland on steroids but with sunshine, plus the best fish and chips in the world. We had a quick week-long Australian road trip from Sydney to Byron Bay before landing in Bali - another total mind-shift. Having turned all rugged and outdoors-y we suddenly found ourselves in an amazing fully-staffed house in Umulas, 15 minutes north of groovy Seminyak. Rented for the same price as a pitch on a French campsite, it was a typical Balinese no-solid-walls no fence-around-the-pool sort of affair. Think pavilions with wafty muslin. Absolutely stunning, but a death trap for non-swimming toddlers. Thankfully we found there was a fence that could be erected around the pool.  I was able to relax on that padded lounger after all. And relax we did. While the boys attended a playgroup for ex-pat kids, we joined a sports club up the coast in Canggu with an air-conditioned library and aqua aerobics in its palm-fringed pool. We had amazing massages, ate delicious sushi and I had my roots done while keeping to our \u00a3100-a-day budget. We were so blissed-out it was hard to leave but there were still two months left. We were a little travel weary so we decided to spend them touring France in a VW campervan. With some new bikes, we cycled across what felt like most of the country with the kids on the back. As we neared home I started trying to cram their feet into shoes and nagged them constantly to stop eating with their fingers. Their year away had turned them into inquisitive, confident - if occasionally wild - little boys who would eat anything, talk to everyone, and had learned to argue very well. What did I learn? Don&apos;t try to re-live your original gap year. With kids in tow you probably won&apos;t be able to hike up to the hill-top tribe or join in that late-night beach party. Do it. Absolutely do it, but do it differently.  Strange food, long journeys and foreign illnesses just weren&apos;t a problem. It was the non-stop backpacking and living in small hotel rooms that proved the most challenging. Where it worked best was when we rented a base for a couple of months and ventured out for little mini-breaks. You can still have that thrilling feeling of the exotic, but with a comforting day-to-day familiarity. And that way find a babysitter too. I was totally unprepared for the reality of travelling with two tiny and rather demanding characters, who didn&apos;t even carry their own bags. It was one of the hardest things I&apos;ve ever done. But now that time has helped erode some of the more painful memories it was also the greatest adventure. Real storiesThe grey gappers James Birrell, 61 I was a corporate lawyer in Edinburgh but worked largely away from home, and decided I would retire as soon as possible to make the most of life. Each of our three children had enjoyed, or were to enjoy, a gap year, so when I retired at the age of 52, my wife Angela and I started planning our three journeys: to south-east Asia, the Indian subcontinent and Australasia. As older travellers, there were a few extra considerations - we knew it was important to be fit before we left, know our limitations and have decent travel insurance. Our trip began with two weeks in Borneo, climbing Mount Kinabalu, staying in an Iban longhouse where, despite the human skulls hanging from the timbers of these (now retired) headhunters, we were astonished by how much we had in common. We flew on to Singapore, went overland to Bangkok via Malaysia&apos;s sights, to Vietnam and Thailand. The majority of people we met were younger than us, but they responded to us as equals as we had shared experiences, and it was nice to get to know people our children&apos;s age. We were also able to offer them advice as we had more life experience. The main advantage of being older travellers was having more money, so we could treat ourselves to nice accommodation. We waited a year before our next stint to India, Nepal, Tibet and Sri Lanka. In Nepal we were fortunate to have Dasharath Rai as our trekking guide - a lovely man with loads of experience who also runs an orphanage in Kathmandu (gracetrek.com.np). We will never forget dawn on the Ganges at Varanasi, &quot;our&quot; tiger at Ranthambore, or the encounter with the university professor with the fantastic tenor voice in the caves at Ellora. We left our next big adventure in Australasia until last, expecting it to be the least demanding in physical terms. However we were dogged by illness (heavy colds and bronchitis). We were grateful for the ease of driving our own campervan and by the time we reached New Zealand we felt adventurous (and well) enough to tour the north by motorbike. We planned each trip, but with as little pre-booking as possible, for flexibility. Because I&apos;d just retired and was used to working, I was inclined to do lots of research. We were more organised than the younger people we met. We realised how important it was not to expect to travel as we would have done at 18 - hostels would have been too exhausting. And our children&apos;s tips from their own gap years didn&apos;t help much. Thankfully we didn&apos;t need to know how to kill hostel bedbugs and where to party all night! Real storiesThe career gapper Ash Dawson, 35, currently in Cordoba, Argentina When the credit crunch hit I was working in IT in Manchester, and as a short-term contractor I was one of the first to be made redundant. I&apos;d always planned to visit South America. I was going to a wedding in Australia at Christmas and was going to do some travelling after that, but as soon as I lost my job I brought it forward. Within about five weeks of being made redundant I was in Buenos Aires, Argentina, trying to learn Spanish. My plan was to be in Buenos Aires for two months and then head north, up to Bolivia, then through Peru, Ecuador and Colombia before flying out of Brazil to Australia for the wedding. Almost three months in and I can honestly say I&apos;m having the time of my life. It took a bit of adjusting to at first; Buenos Aires is a vast city, which came as something of a shock after Manchester and it was also a little disconcerting that so few people spoke English. It&apos;s completely different to Europe - something as simple as buying a mobile phone or having your hair cut can be quite a challenge - but that means you always have good stories. I&apos;d signed up for an eight-week intensive Spanish course and I&apos;d advise anyone coming to South America for a decent amount of time to do the same thing; having Spanish is essential. I had allowed \u00a31,000 a month to live on - about half of what it would cost me in Manchester - and although I may have overspent a little in Buenos Aires (it&apos;s a 24-hour city, so very hard not to) overall the cost of living is astoundingly cheap. I travelled up to Mendoza, the wine-producing region, where a bottle of top-class Malbec goes for about \u00a32.50 - perfect with a juicy Argentinian steak. At the moment I&apos;m in Cordoba, a big bustling university city. I&apos;m travelling alone, but there are so many people doing the same thing, and we all have the same fear about how to meet people, that everyone is keen to meet up and go out together. I&apos;ve had some great nights out, but I do think it&apos;s best to try and meet and talk to local people; it&apos;s definitely been the best way to improve my Spanish. If I hadn&apos;t taken this chance, I&apos;d just be sitting around applying for jobs - and I know a lot of people who are doing that back in Manchester. But this is the best thing I&apos;ve ever done and I&apos;d recommend it to anyone. I don&apos;t see it as a risk career-wise, because I still keep a check on the job situation - all the hostels have Wi-Fi - and if anything interesting did come up I can just jump on a flight and go home. My plan is to head on up to Bolivia and we&apos;ll see what happens from there. I think it&apos;s important to be fairly flexible and allow the experiences to happen to you. And they do ... I met a Brazilian girl and we went to Iguaz\u00fa Falls and she said she wanted to spend the rest of her life with me. I never got offers like that in Manchester. \u2022 See Ash&apos;s blog at getjealous.com/ad1974", "publicationDate": "2009-08-15T23:02:00Z", "tags": ["Gap year travel", "Family holidays", "Travelling solo", "India holidays", "Vietnam holidays", "New Zealand holidays", "Australia holidays", "France holidays", "Buenos Aires holidays", "Argentina holidays", "Travel", "Backpacking holidays"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/aug/16/gap-years-family-holidays", "title": "Family, grey and career gappers describe their gap years", "sentences": ["We flew on to Singapore, went overland to Bangkok via Malaysia&apos;s sights, to Vietnam and Thailand."]}, {"article": "A US citizen who swam across a lake to visit the detained Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi left the country today after a visiting US senator secured his early release from a jail term. John Yettaw, who arrived uninvited at the Rangoon home where Aung San Suu Kyi has been under house arrest for 14 of the past 20 years, flew to Bangkok on a military plane with Senator Jim Webb. Yettaw stayed at the opposition leader&apos;s lakeside home for two days following the incident in May. The ruling junta used the visit as a pretext for a trial at which Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s house arrest was extended for another 18 months, thus denying her the chance to contest next May&apos;s elections. Yettaw, whose motives remain unclear, was sentenced to seven years&apos; hard labour at the same hearing. Webb secured the American&apos;s release at a meeting with General Than Shwe, the head of the junta. The senator said he was grateful and called for further engagement with Burma. &quot;It is my hope that we can take advantage of these gestures as a way to begin laying a foundation of goodwill and confidence-building in the future,&quot; he said. British diplomats welcomed the breakthrough and revealed the UK had also covertly adopted a &quot;new approach&quot; to dealing with the junta. A source said officials were using a two-tier approach, which entailed negotiating openly with the Burmese leadership on one hand while maintaining pressure to clean up the country&apos;s human rights record on the other. A Foreign Office source said: &quot;It remains to be seen whether it will be effective.&quot; Webb&apos;s meeting with the junta was the highest-level official trip by an American politician to the beleaguered country in more than a decade. He was the first senior American official ever to meet Shwe. Pictures emerged earlier today of Webb&apos;s meetings, first with General Shwe and later a 45-minute visit to 64-year-old Aung San Suu Kyi at a guest house, arranged by government officials in Tangoon. Details on the discussions were scarce, but it is understood that Webb asked for the opposition leader&apos;s release. While the release of Yettaw is likely to be seen as a personal coup for the up-and-coming Democratic politician, its impact in the world of diplomacy may be more uncertain. It comes after former president Bill Clinton&apos;s recent meeting with the reclusive North Korean leader Kim Jong-il that secured the release of two arrested American journalists who had been sentenced to long jail terms after being convicted of crossing into the country illegally. Clinton&apos;s visit was welcomed by many, who applauded the freeing of the two women. But others attacked it, saying it represented a propaganda coup for Pyongyang, which has long sought direct engagement with the US as it pursues its nuclear weapons programme. Webb&apos;s visit to Burma is likely to be seen in the same light. Some will praise Webb&apos;s visit as a victory for President Barack Obama&apos;s vow to engage more with the world&apos;s repressive regimes as a method of reforming them. Others will see it as giving a brutal foreign government an air of legitimacy. Some Burmese opposition groups have also expressed doubts about the mission, especially after the brutal crackdown on an attempted pro-democracy uprising in 2007. A coalition of Burmese activists wrote Webb a letter before his trip, expressing their fears. &quot;We are concerned that the military regime will manipulate and exploit your visit and propagandise that you endorse their treatment [of Aung San Suu Kyi] and more than 2,100 political prisoners,&quot; the letter said. Secrecy surrounded Webb&apos;s mission. The US embassy in Burma said it had little knowledge of his plans and that all arrangements were made by his office in Washington. Webb is a noted proponent of engaging with Burma and believes that isolating the country does more harm than good. That is not a popular opinion with many American diplomatic experts, especially conservatives. But Webb&apos;s meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi will help mollify some of those detractors. The Obama administration, along with most other governments, has denounced her recent show trial and guilty verdict. The United Nations has also expressed concern, though a more strongly worded statement condemning it was watered down by Burma&apos;s diplomatic allies Russia and China. Burma has been under military rule since 1962. The junta called elections in 1990 but refused to honour the results when Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s party, the National League for Democracy, won overwhelmingly. Its rule is marked by brutal arrests, tight control of the media and the internet, and a lack of political freedom for ordinary Burmese.", "publicationDate": "2009-08-16T11:10:01Z", "tags": ["Aung San Suu Kyi", "US news", "World news", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/16/burma-aung-san-suu-kyi-john-yettaw", "title": "Aung San Suu Kyi's intruder John Yettaw leaves Burma with Senator Jim Webb", "sentences": ["John Yettaw, who arrived uninvited at the Rangoon home where Aung San Suu Kyi has been under house arrest for 14 of the past 20 years, flew to Bangkok on a military plane with Senator Jim Webb."]}, {"article": "The US man who swam across a lake on a mission to visit the Burmese pro-democracy opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, flew out of the country today after a US senator secured his early release from prison.

Webb, the first US politician to see the general, was the most senior US figure to go to Burmay in more than a decade. The Burmese junta used Yettaw&apos;s visit in May \u2013 when the 53-year-old arrived unannounced at the pro-democracy leader&apos;s lakeside home in Rangoon \u2013 to charge her with violating the terms of the house arrest which has seen her detained for 14 of the past 20 years.

Webb said he had met Than Shwe in Naypyidaw, the junta&apos;s remote new capital city, yesterday before being flown to Rangoon for a 45-minute audience with Aung San Suu Kyi. He told reporters he had urged the general to release the 64-year-old politician, whose National League for Democracy overwhelmingly won a general election in 1990 \u2013 a result ignored by the junta. &quot;With the scrutiny of the outside world judging their government very largely through how they are treating Aung San Suu Kyi, it&apos;s to their advantage that she&apos;s allowed to participate in the political process,&quot; he said. &quot;What I said to the leaders of Myanmar is that I believe that it will be impossible for the rest of the world to believe the elections were free and fair if she was not released.&quot; Webb, who chairs a Senate sub-committee on east Asia and the Pacific, is a proponent of engagement with Burma, a stance criticised by many exiled Burmese opposition groups. Aung Din, of the US Campaign for Burma, told the Associated Press that the senator&apos;s mission was flawed. &quot;This will surely make a negative impression among the people of Burma,&quot; he said. &quot;They will think that Americans are easy to satisfy with the dictators when they get their citizens back.&quot; Yettaw&apos;s motivation for swimming across the lake to Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s home remains a mystery. Apparently prompted in part by grief over the death of his 17-year-old son in a motorbike accident, he set off for Asia a year ago seemingly intent on good works, visiting orphanages in Vietnam before spending time with Burmese refugees in Thailand. He then entered Burma, hoping \u2013 according to some accounts \u2013 to warn Aung San Suu Kyi that she faced an imminent threat from assassination. On the night of 3 May, he crossed the lake to the pro-democracy leader&apos;s home, where he was discovered the next morning when her companions heard his exhausted moaning. Aung San Suu Kyi told her subsequent trial that she had ordered himn to leave, but permitted him to stay for a night because of his apparent ill health.

Gerald and Patricia Green, the American organisers of the week-long Bangkok international film festival, are accused of paying for business contracts that brought the couple $14m (\u00a38.5m) in profits. In a trial due to start tomorrow in a US district court, prosecutors will allege that they paid Juthamas Siriwan, the former governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, around $1.8m to help secure the festival and tourism-related deals, beginning in 2002.  Gerald Green, who produced Stone&apos;s Salvador and Werner Herzog&apos;s hostage drama Rescue Dawn, starring Christian Bale and filmed in Thailand, faces 20 counts. Patricia Green, who produced Diamonds, a comedy starring Kirk Douglas, Dan Aykroyd and Lauren Bacall, faces 21 counts. They each could receive up to life in prison if convicted. Both have pleaded not guilty to the charges and are free on bail.  The Greens&apos; lawyer, Jerome Mooney, insisted his clients received the contracts &quot;because they did good work&quot;. He said: &quot;They entered into consulting agreements with those who had connections with powerful people.&quot; Siriwan, who served in her post from 2002 to 2006, has denied any wrongdoing.

There&apos;s no use denying it. When one of my friends politely asked the waitress for a fork, I actually felt myself wince with embarrassment.  The cutlery swiftly arrived, without a hint of condescension, and, as the rest of us smugly shovelled in noodles with our chopsticks (all no doubt silently congratulating ourselves on our skills), someone else remarked that you could tell a lot about a person by the way they held their sticks. Only children and peasants grasped them anywhere but the very top, she claimed. We looked down, and simultaneously realised the truth. For all our airs and graces, none of us were any more sophisticated than the average Vietnamese three-year-old. Of course, chopsticks aren&apos;t appropriate everywhere east of Kathmandu: sushi, for example, is properly a finger food. Picking it up with your hands helps you to appreciate its delicate texture, allows the chef to vary the density of the rice according to the type of fish, and makes life a whole lot easier for the people who clean the tables. But now we&apos;ve got the hang of the damn things, it seems we&apos;re determined to use them, on sushi, on spring rolls ... I&apos;ve even seen people demanding a pair in Thai restaurants despite the fact that in Bangkok they prefer a fork and spoon.  And it&apos;s not just the exotic flavours of the east which get us in a (daikon) pickle: 20 years ago, the received wisdom was that &quot;the only graceful and satisfying way to eat real Italian spaghetti \u2026 is \u2026 with a large soup spoon and fork&quot;. It&apos;s since emerged that, like hinged chopsticks in China, in Italy, &quot;spoons are for children, amateurs and people with bad table manners in general&quot;. These days most of us have mastered the art of twirling it against the plate instead, but debate still rages about whether it&apos;s more &apos;authentic&apos; to pick up a slice of pizza with one&apos;s hands \u2013 or just more American.  Come clean. Are there any terrible cross-cultural faux pas that make you wince in shame at the perpetrator, yourself, or both?

Now, James Bowthorpe, a 32-year-old Londoner, is just 18 days from proving that it is not. He is aiming to beat the record by two or three weeks, claiming that a narrower margin would be &quot;ungentlemanly&quot;. And this has been achieved despite a cracked crank arm, an attempted kidnapping in Iran and a serious illness that forced a five-day rest stop in Bangkok. Crashing into a wombat didn&apos;t help, either. &quot;In general, headwinds are the hardest thing to deal with \u2013 they&apos;re so soul-destroying. It&apos;s an environmental and physical hardship that becomes an emotional hardship \u2013 you just can&apos;t beat them and it can really grind you down,&quot; wrote Bowthorpe on email, from a tent somewhere in the USA. &quot;Until the wombat incident I had no punctures. Not one, from Hyde Park to the middle of Australia. After that I got several in quick succession in the back tyre, which were just as frustrating to fix in the middle of the Nullarbor [an arid plain in Australia] as they are in Balham,&quot; he said. The secret of his success could well be his motivation \u2014 fundraising. James&apos; grandfather suffered from Parkinson&apos;s, which led him to volunteer at a research clinic working to fight the disease. This trip is designed primarily to raise \u00a31.8m for that organisation, or \u00a3100 for every mile travelled. &quot;The clinic has got by on a shoestring budget for several years, and the doctors that lead the research are working constantly at funding the next five years of work,&quot; said Bowthorpe. &quot;I decided I wanted to help \u2013 my contribution was taking on the hardest challenge I could find. When Mark Beaumont set the current record many thought it was unbreakable, so I thought that would be the thing to do.&quot; But while Beaumont raised money for charity, first and foremost his attempt was pure adventure. Bowthorpe has been on the road now for five months, and still has to reach the east coast of the USA, fly to Portugal and race home through Spain and France. The end is in sight, although he has to maintain a torturous 160 mile per day pace to hit his target. Personally, I think the final legs have the potential to be as exciting as the closing minutes of a Tour de France stage. All the more because James is carrying lots of technology on his bike, and is quite accessible online; you can follow his exact position by GPS, read his blog and send him messages of encouragement via Twitter. By far the most important link - as far as James&apos; is concerned - is his fundraising page.

According to one recent New York Times article, it is now the region&apos;s Provincetown (the Cape Cod resort favoured by gay visitors). This ever-changing city seems to have become a mirror where people project their own fantasies. Comparing Beirut with another city, whether Paris, Rome or Provincetown is a denial of its uniqueness. Beirut&apos;s gay culture is also unique and specific. As a gay man who has lived in the city for more than 30 years, I know that notions such as &quot;gay&quot;, &quot;straight&quot;, &quot;public displays of affection&quot; and &quot;homophobia&quot; can take on completely different forms and meanings in this part of the world. Yet there was no mention of these nuances in the New York Times article, obviously built on a series of denials. &quot;When I go out from Bardo [a gay-friendly restaurant] I always feel at ease hugging my friends \u2013 of course in a decent way \u2013 in front of the police. This is the kind of change I am talking about,&quot; Raed is quoted as saying. No mention of the fact that Lebanon, like all countries of the region, is a place where men often touch, kiss and hold each other&apos;s hands in public, whether gay, straight, policemen or not (whereas in New York, holding hands can apparently cost you your life). Or the fact that Lebanese heterosexual couples do not necessarily show more public affection than gay ones, also for reasons of &quot;decency&quot;. If any &quot;change&quot; has recently occurred, it is only in the fantasies of some. Reading this article, it seems as though gay culture in Lebanon was non-existent until the clubs it mentions opened or the Mr Bear Arabia election took place. In reality, one could go back to the Phoenicians to find same-sex relations an integral part of local culture. In more recent years, and even during the civil war (1975-90), gay men and women have gathered and partied in many public places, more or less visible but nonetheless vibrant. The author not only denies local gay culture its history, but also its real space. Most of the venues cited in the article are hangouts for the Beiruti moneyed \u00e9lite. In some, you will not be admitted if you don&apos;t come with an expensive car or wear certain fashion brands. Thankfully, the vast majority of the Lebanese don&apos;t belong to this obnoxious crowd. The less affluent gay population meets in different places, doesn&apos;t talk about its escapades in the Marais or Soho, doesn&apos;t always speak English or French or watch Sex and the City. In fact, it seems to have its own world, much larger and more open than the one described in the article. The story of Paradise Beach is a telling example. This large public beach in the city of Byblos was very popular with working-class gay men from different cities and religions. A colourful place where gay men mingled and flirted more freely than elsewhere. Until the day the beach was privatised and turned into a luxury resort, with a strict admittance policy. However, a small strip of land was still left unsold and frequented by the working-class gays. The sight was amusing: the resort&apos;s stiff and bourgeois crowds \u2013 gay and straight alike \u2013 eyeing with utter shock their flamboyant neighbours. Today there are no more public gay beaches left in Lebanon. The article also denies other Arab countries their own gay cultures. Many western journalists sum up Arab gay realities with sentences like: &quot;Saudi Arabia: homosexuality punishable by death&quot;, &quot;Iraq: gay men killed.&quot; Full stop. But gay men are also killed in &quot;civilised&quot; western countries. While homophobia is certainly a problem in Arab countries, like anywhere else, it never overshadows the thriving and lively local gay cultures. Yet no one talks about these cultures. &quot;Cairo: bad&quot;, &quot;Damascus: bad&quot;, we&apos;re told by Ricardo, the Spaniard in the article. Even Dubya and his &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; would envy such eloquence. How ironic that many Lebanese gay men, including myself, actually feel more comfortable in places like Damascus or Amman and go there often in order to escape the Beiruti agitation. There might be no Kylie Minogue nights there, but on the other hand there is a lot less snobbery and less fuss about homosexuality. My friend Ali recently went to Jordan to be wedded to his boyfriend by a Muslim cleric and then spent his honeymoon in Damascus. The advantage of such trips also comes in finding an anonymity one is denied at home. But even Amman seems to have its &quot;globalised&quot; gay crowd. Watching Ugly Betty and wearing D&amp;G is what gay culture is about, these people seem to say, along with the NYT article and many gay men across the global village. I can still remember how discovering Steven, the gay character in Dynasty, during my childhood in the 1980s, opened a whole new perspective for me. It is another matter altogether to equate this mass consumption with gay culture, or even with gay rights advocacy. Just as Beirut&apos;s old neighbourhoods are being gentrified, its &quot;superb architecture&quot; (sic) being torn down to make way for soulless, surveillance-camera-equipped skyscrapers, its local gay culture is facing the challenge of McDonaldisation. How long before writers start describing Beirut as a new Bangkok \u2013 rather than a Provincetown?Will sex tourism advance its population&apos;s gay rights or social wellbeing? In the meantime, Beirut is certainly turning back into the playground of multinational companies, regional interests and greedy entrepreneurs (&quot;I can see a future for us here&quot;, one businessman says in the article). The NYT article falls into the category of the infomercial, tailor-made for a certain clientele, and it has every right to. However, it is typical of much reporting about the Arab world, perpetuating tired stereotypes: Arabs are homophobes, except for the &quot;westernised&quot; ones, Arabs are &quot;sexy savages&quot;. In doing so, not only is it extending the cultural gap further, but it is also exposing a much wider divide: the one between the haves and the have-nots.", "publicationDate": "2009-08-31T13:00:00Z", "tags": ["Lebanon", "LGBT rights", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/31/lebanon-gay-rights", "title": "Beirut: city of projected fantasies | Diamond Walid", "sentences": ["How long before writers start describing Beirut as a new Bangkok \u2013 rather than a Provincetown?Will sex tourism advance its population&apos;s gay rights or social wellbeing?"]}, {"article": "Those attending this year&apos;s Raindance film festival, running from 30 September to 11 October, can look forward to a bit of sex and violence with their dreary weather.

This perspective needs to be reversed. The great Asian war had a seismic momentum of its own. Fighting began\u00a0in 1931 and there was barely a hiatus when Japan surrendered to the allies in August 1945. Between 1941 and 1945 alone, war claimed around 24 million lives in Japanese-occupied Asia, perhaps 3 million Japanese, and 3.5 million more in India through war-related famine. Of\u00a0these victims, the European, American and Australasian casualties numbered perhaps 1% of the total. But such tallies do not convey the full scale of the tragedy. Roads to war  The roots of war lay in western imperial competition in Asia and the quest of newly modernising states such as China and Japan for wealth, power and equality. Japan&apos;s rapid industrialisation, like that of the west, required privileged access to raw materials overseas. To Japan, to be a modern power was to be a colonial power. By the 1914-1918 war, she controlled the assets of Korea and Taiwan, and demanded greater access to those of China. Resistance to Japanese imperialism was a defining moment of national awakening in China. Japan&apos;s insistence on its &quot;special interests&quot; in China flew in the face of the so-called &quot;open door&quot; policy that was backed by the United States, Britain and the League of Nations. Many Japanese soldiers and politicians now saw the international system as a form of racial exclusion, designed by the western powers to protect their own imperial interests, and to deny newcomers theirs. In 1918, Prince Fumimaro Konoe, a later prime minister, wrote that it condemned Japan &quot;to remain forever subordinate to the advanced nations&quot;. When after 1928, a stronger central government arose in China under Chiang Kai-shek, and was recognised by the west, Japan was increasingly isolated. As the great depression squeezed resources, many argued that the only way for Japan to progress was to go it alone. In 1931, Japanese armies annexed the mineral-rich Chinese province of Manchuria [Manchukuo], and created a puppet regime under Pu Yi, China&apos;s last emperor. The initiative came from commanders in the field who wanted to commit civilian politicians at home to a bolder imperial policy. In July 1937, a skirmish between Chinese and Japanese troops near Beijing was escalated by the Japanese into a war of conquest of the north-east and maritime provinces \u2192 \u2190 of China. When the capital Nanjing fell in December 1937, a huge number of civilians, probably more than 300,000, were massacred. This brutal campaign overshadows Sino-Japanese relations to this day. The Chinese government of Chiang Kai-shek fled to the inland city of Chongqing. It was weakened and corrupt, but committed to modernising China and restoring its sovereignty. A\u00a0patriotic &quot;united front&quot; was patched up between Chiang and his main rivals, Mao Zedong&apos;s communists, who gathered strength in their northern redoubt of Yan&apos;an. It was a fragile truce, not a working alliance. &quot;The Japanese are a disease of the skin,&quot; Chiang said in 1941, &quot;the communists are a disease of the heart.&quot; But Chiang had gained time and allies. President Franklin D Roosevelt&apos;s family fortune came from the China trade; he believed that a democratic China was destined to lead modern Asia. But he was not prepared to go to war for it. Nor were the British. Instead they supplied Chongqing by air and road over the &quot;Hump&quot; from British Burma. By late 1941, a US soldier, the acerbic &quot;Vinegar Joe&quot; Stilwell, was in effective command of Chiang&apos;s troops. He considered Chiang a &quot;stubborn bugger&quot;, reluctant to commit Chinese armies to battle, but Stilwell under-estimated Chiang&apos;s wiliness in drawing the Japanese into a long, costly war they could not win. Japan now felt even more tightly encircled by the ABCD powers: America,\u00a0Britain, China and the Dutch. The Netherlands East Indies was the best available source of oil for the war effort in China: Borneo and South Sumatra produced more than eight million tonnes a year. But blocking Japan&apos;s path to it was the British &quot;fortress&quot; of Singapore. On 27 September 1940, Japan entered into a fateful tripartite pact with Germany and Italy. For Japan, Wilhelmine Germany had been a model for a modernising, martial monarchy. As Japanese politics lurched to the right, fascism too seemed a &quot;kindred spirit&quot;. Both Germany and Japan spoke of shattering and remoulding the international order. But Japanese leaders were motivated by a deeper conviction that Emperor Hirohito was to be the nucleus of a new regional cosmology: a &quot;greater east Asian co-prosperity sphere&quot;. After the fall of Paris, Japan occupied French Indochina to cut off a supply route to Chongqing and as a springboard to the south. But the European war presented new obstacles to Japan&apos;s destiny in Asia. It caused the United States to expand its navy and to look more sympathetically upon the British empire in Asia, to help Britain fight on in Europe. Crucially, the occupation of Indochina was met by crippling economic sanctions from the United States and the west, effectively cutting off Japan&apos;s imports of oil. In late 1940 and 1941, as positions hardened and diplomacy failed, the argument was voiced in Tokyo that only by war could these obstacles be overcome. As Japan&apos;s militant new prime minster Hideki Tojo told an imperial conference on 5 November 1941: &quot;I fear that we would become a third-class nation after two or three years if we just sat tight.&quot; Japan&apos;s 70 days On 8 December 1941, Yamashita Tomoyuki&apos;s 25th Army landed on the north-east coast of Malaya and began a driving charge down the peninsula to Singapore. The British had long expected this, but failed to launch their planned pre-emptive strike into neutral Thailand, so-called Operation Matador. What was not foreseen was the simultaneous strike by air and sea at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. This achieved the short-term goal of removing the immediate threat of the US Pacific fleet. But, given the fury of America&apos;s reaction, it made Japan&apos;s rather vaguer\u00a0long-term goal \u2013 a negotiated and advantageous peace \u2013 much harder to attain. The British in Malaya viewed the Japanese with racist contempt. &quot;I\u00a0suppose you&apos;ll push the little men off,&quot; was the reported reaction of the governor of Singapore. But British, Australian and Indian troops were confronted by hardened veterans of the China war, advancing 20km a day by bicycle. Allied forces fell back into Singapore with a speed that did not allow them to regroup and counter-attack effectively. But &quot;fortress Singapore&quot; was a myth. There were no fixed land defences to\u00a0speak of, few modern warplanes, and the naval base had no capital ships.\u00a0When the Prince of Wales and Repulse were sent to the South China Sea, they were sunk by Japanese torpedo bombers. Reinforcements poured into Singapore, only to witness in disgust the scorched earth destruction of the naval base they had been sent to defend. The brutal reality was that for Churchill and the chiefs of staff in London, the first call on war materials was the Mediterranean theatre. Churchill ordered the garrison to fight and die to the last man. But at the hour of the final assault on Singapore town, fearing a wholesale slaughter of civilians, local commanders were given leave to surrender on 15 February 1942. The campaign had lasted only 70 days. Lost armies  Without pause, the Japanese pressed on into the Indonesian and Philippine archipelagos. Four days after the fall\u00a0of\u00a0Singapore, bombs fell for the first\u00a0time on Australian soil. The Australian cabinet demanded the recall of their troops. Many of them were among the 85,000 soldiers marched into captivity in Singapore. The entire colonial order in Asia was incarcerated. On the best estimates, there were 130,895 civilian internees of the Japanese, more than 11% of whom were to perish. Of the 132,134 prisoners of war, 35,756 died in captivity. But these figures do not include the Asian soldiers captured, the 45,000 Filipinos who fought with the Americans, or some 40,000 Indians in Singapore. Abandoned by their European officers, the Indians were presented with a huge moral dilemma. It seemed as if the British had &quot;handed them over like cattle&quot;, and many were now recruited into a new Indian national army to fight alongside Japan for India&apos;s liberation. British prestige in Asia was shattered by the abandonment of its people. The ugly evacuation of Europeans was, as one British nurse in Penang put it, &quot;a thing that I am sure will never be forgotten or forgiven&quot;. Convinced that the British empire was on the point of collapse, Japan attacked Burma from Thailand. The initial aim was limited: to prevent the reinforcement of Malaya from India. But it became all-out conquest. British reluctance to call on the Chinese to save the British empire meant that intervention by Chinese forces under Stilwell came too late. It\u00a0cost the Chinese more than 10,000 men. As the British retreated, one of the largest displacements of people in history occurred as around 600,000 Indian refugees fled west to Bengal; as many as 80,000 of them died on the wayside. It was the Indian army that made Britain a power of consequence in Asia. During the war, more than two million Indians were recruited to arms. But Gandhi and other leaders of the Indian National Congress did not see it as India&apos;s war. The &quot;Quit India&quot; protests of 1942 were a challenge on a scale not seen since the great rebellion of 1857. As the stragglers from Burma stumbled into the great imperial city of Calcutta, it seemed to herald the imminent apocalypse of the Raj. In Burma, the Japanese were welcomed by some as liberators. Around 18,000 young nationalists travelled in their train as a &quot;Burma independence army&quot;. In the villages, they kindled a promise of freedom and martial revival. In Indonesia, it was said that the Japanese fulfilled the prophecy of the 12th-century king, Joyoboyo: that the rule of the white man would end with the coming of the dwarfish yellow men, who would reign only as long as &quot;a maize seed took to flower&quot;. But for the 2.3 million overseas Chinese of Malaya and Singapore it was the bitterest defeat. Their campaigns for &quot;national salvation&quot; had raised around one third of Chongqing&apos;s war expenditure. Chinese volunteers fought in the last-ditch defence of Singapore, and joined guerrilla bands in the jungle. One Japanese commander described entering Malaya as if it was &quot;the crossroads of the central province of China&quot;. When Singapore fell, between 50,000 and 100,000 Chinese were slaughtered in a so-called &quot;purification by elimination&quot;. Rape was an instrument of war; the standard military-issue condom was branded &quot;Assault No 1&quot;, and young girls began to be coerced as &quot;comfort women&quot; for Japanese soldiers, perhaps 80,000 to 100,000 across occupied Asia. Global war Japan&apos;s war was a gigantic gamble: that\u00a0its forces could win enough audacious victories and hold on long enough to their gains to win a favourable peace. But no American air-carriers or submarines had been destroyed at Hawaii, and they now preyed on Japanese shipping. Dutch and British &quot;scorched earth&quot; further reduced the spoils of conquest. By 1944, oil production in Indonesia was below half its pre-war level. The military-industrial arithmetic was decisive. During the war, Japan produced 70,000 warplanes; the US 300,000 \u2013 and 10 times more munitions. This was now global total war. But in many ways Japan was as isolated as ever. Axis cooperation amounted to little. The key agreements had come late in the day, and set the boundaries of each other&apos;s operations rather than combining them. There was no concerted assault on India. Strategic objectives diverged further over Russia. Japan had joined the axis partly to reduce the risk of war with the Soviets. But this again became a possibility when the Nazi-Soviet pact was thrown aside. Although Hitler disliked the idea of even &quot;honorary Aryans&quot; fighting in Germany&apos;s war of destiny in the east, Japan&apos;s help was sought in January 1943. It declined. Its &quot;final war&quot; was to be fought in the Pacific, with indifference, ultimately, to Germany&apos;s fate. By May 1942, Japan&apos;s perimeter was at its widest extent. But at the same moment, it was contained and turned back in the Pacific at Coral Sea and Midway, where the Japanese lost four carriers and more than 300 warplanes. In the south, the Japanese suffered their first defeat by land, when their landings in New Guinea were repulsed by the Australians and Americans in a series of battles that saw some of the heaviest casualty rates of the war. These were not perhaps the irreversible &quot;turning points&quot;, but they allowed the allies to think in offensive terms. One effect of containment in Asia was to allow the United States to maintain a strategy that placed &quot;Europe first&quot;. In Cairo, between 22 and 26 November 1943, Churchill, Roosevelt and Chiang came face to face for the first time. Roosevelt gave the generalissimo great power status, but privately he asked Stilwell: &quot;How long do you think Chiang can last?&quot; Chiang was not present at the conference two days later with Stalin in Tehran, at which the invasion of France took precedence over all else. The new South East Asia Command (SEAC) under Lord Louis Mountbatten did not mean, as Americans quipped, that they would &quot;Save England&apos;s Asian \u2190 Colonies&quot;. Mountbatten&apos;s cherished plans for amphibious landings in Malaya were not executed until after the surrender of Japan. Unable to take war to Japan themselves, the British employed others to wage it on their behalf. In Burma, ethnic minorities such as the Shan, Kachin and Karen were armed against the Japanese and Burmese. In Malaya, by August 1945, around 5,000 fighters of the Malayan Communist party were kitted out with guns and khaki by air drops to support the allied invasion that never came. The seeds of future confrontations were sown. The new Asia  As the first fury of conquest subsided, the Japanese attempted to build a new Asia. A formidable propaganda machine promoted Nippon language, culture and modernity, and attempted to recruit Asian leaders to its cause. This often backfired. Attempts to rally Islam by calls of jihad, and ordering worshippers in the mosques to bow in prayer not towards Mecca, but towards the imperial palace in Tokyo, outraged the Muslims of Malaya and Indonesia. Japanese pan-Asianism was less important in what it achieved for Japan than in providing a platform for Asian politicians \u2013 men such as Sukarno in Indonesia and Aung San in Burma \u2013 to realise their own national visions, and to raise their own armies. On 4 July 1943, prime minister Tojo appeared at a rally in Singapore. At his side was Subhas Chandra Bose,\u00a0a\u00a0radical Congress leader who had\u00a0escaped arrest by the British in India in 1941 and fled to Berlin. In a rare joint operation, he was transferred from a German to a Japanese submarine off the coast of Madagascar and flown to Tokyo. Bose&apos;s charisma as national leader rallied the Indians in south-east Asia behind the Indian national army. He proclaimed a provisional government of &quot;free India&quot;, and toured the region, raising funds. Young Indian women threw their jewellery at his feet and enlisted to fight alongside the men. Their call was &quot;Chalo Delhi!&quot; (&quot;On to Delhi!&quot;), the cry of the mutineers of 1857. Rumours of this soon reached India; it was the beginning of the end of the Indian army as an instrument of British power in Asia. But as war conditions deteriorated, Japanese idealism died, and most Asians only saw imperialism in another form. Japan plundered its colonies for war materials and coerced labour for the Bangkok-Rangoon railway and other projects; more than 70,000 men from Malaya alone. The supply of food broke down across all fronts. In Bengal alone in 1943, more than 3.5 million people died from starvation and disease. The loss of the rice bowl of Burma was compounded by the failures of the British Raj. Final throws  Japanese commanders saw Britain as the weakest of the enemies that encircled them. In March 1944, supported by 40,000 troops of the Indian national army, and hoping to precipitate a revolt within India, the Japanese launched their forces in Burma at the frontier. In China, the massive Ichi-go offensive attempted to destroy the airfields from which US bombers attacked Japanese shipping and cities. These were last, desperate throws of the dice. In Burma, half a million men were locked in some of the bitterest fighting of the war. The British positions in Kohima and Imphal held for five months. Then William Slim&apos;s 14th Army \u2013 Britons, Indians, Gurkhas, Africans \u2013 began to strike forward into Arakan. As reports of Japanese atrocities circulated among the troops, Slim reported, &quot;quarter was neither asked, nor given&quot;. The young Japanese soldiers they faced believed the survival of their homeland was at stake. In the words of the soldier-poet Alun Lewis, they fought &quot;Sleeplessly watching, knifing and falling back&quot;. British and Indian troops were now better led, better provisioned, and backed by US warplanes and the resources of the Indian subcontinent. But the turning of &quot;defeat into victory&quot; was largely the work of Indian soldiers, traders and officials, who would not accept a return to the status quo. The Raj was a mighty weapon of war, but once loosed, the recoil shook the British empire to its foundations. In the Pacific, General MacArthur&apos;s combined operations punched ahead towards Palau and Saipan, which put B-29 bombers in range of Japan&apos;s major cities. These turning points were achieved at a shocking human cost, and greater costs now had to be weighed: not least that of assaulting Japan&apos;s home islands. Britain was desperate to redeem the disasters of 1942 by regaining Malaya by right of arms. In China, Mao&apos;s armies grew while Chiang&apos;s faced heavy attrition. There was much blood and treasure still to be expended, and the shape of the post-war regional order was still in the balance. It was at this point that Asia&apos;s peoples began to grasp a future beyond empire. Young fighters prepared to strike out in the name of the nation. One of the abiding legacies of war was the political legitimacy it gave to men in uniform and to violent, revolutionary change. When, a year later, Japan collapsed more suddenly than anyone could have imagined, across south-east Asia and in China itself, this merely unleashed a new phase of the long and terrible Asian war.

Best place to eat: Strawberry tartRestaurant de Bacon, Antibes, France &quot;When I go to the south of France in the summer, I always visit the Restaurant de Bacon in the Cap d&apos;Antibes and I wait eagerly, in front of the sea and the old town, for the most amazing wild strawberry tart. The crust melts in the mouth, it is deliciously flavoured with butter, and once you have finished it you feel delightfully naughty.&quot; 688 Boulevard de Bacon, 06160 Cap D&apos;Antibes, France, 0033 4 93 61 50 02, www.restaurantdebacon.com 14. Best place to eat: Pastrami on ryeKatz&apos;s Deli, New York     The mail order department of Katz's Delicatessen on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York. Photograph: Stan Honda/AFP/Getty Images    The legendary pastrami on rye from Katz&apos;s, New York&apos;s oldest (and possibly shabbiest) deli, could qualify as king of all sandwiches by virtue of size alone: a whole pound of brined beef, pre-trimming, is used in each serving. The sandwich \u2013 stacks of juicy meat with mustard and pickles between slices of rye bread \u2013 is as jaw-dropping, taste-wise, as it is gobstopping.

Best place to eat: Custard tartAntiga Confeitaria de Belem, Lisbon Creamy, flaky custard tarts \u2013 served warm with cinnamon \u2013 are one of Portugal&apos;s great culinary gifts to the world. The original pasteis caf\u00e9 in the Bel\u00e9m district of Lisbon, next to the monastery where the dessert was invented, is still the best: their secret recipe has been guarded since 1837. Sit down with a plateful, and a strong coffee, and you&apos;ll understand why more than 10,000 tarts are baked here every day.

Best place to drink: Tomato juiceHappy Girl Kitchen, California &quot;If you find yourself in Marin County, California, it&apos;s well worth the time to drive down the beautiful shoreline road to San Francisco and visit the Ferry Building for the heirloom organic tomato juice from Happy Girl Kitchen, which has a stall there on Saturdays. They blend it with coriander and chilli and it&apos;s quite literally the best tomato juice you&apos;ll ever taste.&quot; Ferry Plaza Farmer&apos;s Market, One Ferry Building, San Francisco, 001 831 750 9579, www.happygirlkitchen.com 18. Best place to eat: Italian slow foodCoco Lezzone, Florence &quot;You can get the most amazing &apos;slow food&apos; in this tiny family- run restaurant which has been around for about 30 years. It is famous for its pappa pomodoro and ribollita \u2013 the two most traditional Tuscan bread soups. And they do the most delicious arista: pork loin cooked on the bone, stuffed with fennel seeds, garlic and rosemary, and served at room temperature.&quot; Via del Parioncino 26, Florence, Italy, 0039 05 52 87 17 8 19.

At his electrical supply shop in London&apos;s Clerkenwell, Mehmet Murat sells wonderful, intensely fruity oil from his family&apos;s olive groves in Cyprus and south-west Turkey. Now he imports more than a 1,000 litres per year. His lemon-flavoured oil is good enough to drink on its own. 76 Compton Street, London EC1, 020 7251 4721, www.planet mem.com And Manni One of the priciest olive oils in the world, the minimum order of a litre of Manni costs \u00a3190. Film director Armando Manni harvests olives from seven plantations at different altitudes on a Tuscan mountain and speed-couriers the oil in small, UV-resistant bottles. The flavours are extraordinary. Chef Thomas Keller, of The French Laundry and Per Se, has called it &quot;the best olive oil in the market&quot;.

Best place to eat: TacosEl Pastorcito, Mexico City People drive the length and breadth of Mexico City, causing traffic jams, to get to this neighbourhood taqueria, which spills out onto the street from dusk till dawn. The main draw is their superlative tacos al pastor \u2013 a speciality of the capital \u2013 made with pork carved from a shawarma-style spit and ultra-fresh salsa served in dramatically massive stone bowls. 4503 Lorenzo Boturini Street, 24 de Abril, Mexico City, Mexico, 0051 55 5764 1185, www.elpastorcitodeboturini.com 22. Best place to eat: Peking DuckQuanjude, Beijing Beijing&apos;s most famous purveyor of Peking duck is nothing if not well-endorsed: more than 115 million ducks have been dished up in the restaurant&apos;s 145-year history, and China&apos;s first Premier, Zhou Enlai, personally chose the location for the seven-storey Hepingmen branch. Quantity hasn&apos;t affected quality: the duck, with its crispy red skin and melt-in-the-mouth flesh, is sublime \u2013 400 versions of the classic dish are available: opt for the classic kaoya.

Photograph: Neville Elder/Corbis    &quot;As far as I&apos;m concerned, the Gramercy Tavern is one of the best places to eat in New York, and the best place to eat pig.

Best place to eat: Vegetarian IndianSagar Ratna, Delhi &quot;Sagar Ratna, in Delhi, serves South Indian vegetarian food \u2013 pukka food that nourishes the body and soul and is always in harmony with the seasons. My favourite dish there has always been idli sambhar: steamed rice cakes with coconut chutney and sambhar lentils.&quot; 18 Defence Colony Market, New Delhi, 110024, Delhi, India, 0091 11 24 33 36 58 25. Best place to eat: SushiDaiwa sushi, Tokyo If you want the world&apos;s best sushi, don&apos;t even think of looking anywhere but Japan. Empty your bank account and eat at one of Tokyo&apos;s swankiest sushi temples, such as the three-Michelin-star Jiro in Ginza. Alternatively, go right to the heart of the action, to the city&apos;s overwhelming Tsukiji fish market (the largest on the planet), and eat unsurpassable sushi for a fraction of the price at Daiwa Sushi. It&apos;s a fast-moving hole-in-the-wall establishment without tables and it&apos;s only open for breakfast, but none of this matters once the expertly prepared rolls come your way. Try the melt-in-the-mouth tai, a type of sea bream that is impossible to get outside Japan. Building 6, Chuo-ichiba, 5-2-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan, 0081 3 3547 6807 26. Best place to eat: Filipino cuisineLighthouse Restaurant, Cebu, Philippines &quot;The Lighthouse in Cebu in the Philippines is my favourite restaurant. We always eat bulalo (beef stew), banana heart salad, adobo (marinaded meat), baked oysters, pancit noodles, lechon de leche (suckling pig) and, to drink, green mango juice \u2013 my daughter is addicted to it! The staff are so friendly and welcoming. The chef has been there for more than 20 years, so the food is very consistent.&quot; Gaisano Country Mall, Banilad, Cebu city, Philippines, 0063 32 231 2478 27.

Superb.&quot; 1517 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California, 001 510 548 5525, www.chezpanisse.com 28. Best place to eat: Algerian foodRestaurant Gnaoua, Algiers &quot;To get a really good North African meal in Algeria you have to get yourself invited to someone&apos;s house, and as there are so few tourists, people would love to have you to their home for a meal. The few restaurants around tend to serve bad French food. That said, there is a handful of really good grilled-fish restaurants down in the port in Algiers. My favourite is a small, traditional place called Restaurant Gnaoua. The owner, Hamidou, understands Algerian cuisine. It&apos;s not an easy cuisine to get, but he just does.&quot; Cite Sahraoui, les Deux Bassins, Ben Aknoun, Algiers, Algeria 29. Best place to eat: Classic French cuisine, Close des Gourmets, Paris &quot;I eat at Clos Des Gourmets two or three times a week when I&apos;m in Paris. They only use seasonal ingredients and always add a touch of wackiness to very classic dishes. They love creating new things. I suppose it&apos;s new classic French cuisine. I&apos;ll have roast kidneys or grilled rabbit with fresh herbs in a white wine sauce, asparagus with truffle in early summer, and a lavender cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e to finish. It&apos;s always madly busy but the dishes are always perfectly cooked. And it&apos;s amazingly cheap: \u00a480 for three courses with wine. Unbelievable.&quot; 16 Avenue Rapp, Paris, 0033 1 45 51 75 61, www.closdesgourmets.com 30. Best place to eat: TapasCal Pep, Barcelona &quot;Cal Pep does completely amazing tapas.

Best place to eat: PizzaFrank Pepe Pizzeria, New Haven, Conneticut You could generate enough heat to fuel a brick oven with the argument over which country bakes the world&apos;s best pizza: Italy, where the concept originated, or America, where it was globalised. Neapolitan purists will make pilgrimages to hotspots such as La Sorrentina, outside Naples, whose chef has won the prestigious Naples Pizza Championship, but we contend that the upstart Yanks do it better. The best American pizza can be found, not in New York as is commonly assumed, but in New Haven, Connecticut, where the Pepe family has been spinning dough since 1925. Their white clam pie has no equals. 157 Wooster Street, New Haven, Connecticut, 001 203 865 5762, www.pepespizzeria.com Pizzeria La Sorrentina, Via Domenico Pirozzi 37, Fratta Maggiore, Italy, 0039 338 3248615 32. Best place to eat: Thai curryKrua Apsorn, Bangkok &quot;When I&apos;m in Bangkok, I go to Apsorn&apos;s Kitchen, also known as Krua Apsorn, a small restaurant just up from the National Library. It is a great place to go for incredibly traditional Thai food. I have the crab in curry powder, followed by the deep-fried kingfish with green mango and the yellow curry with prawns and lotus shoots.&quot; 503-505 Sam San Road, Dusit, Bangkok, Thailand 0066 2 24 18 52 8 33. Best place to eat: Simple French foodLe Vin et L&apos;Assiette, Besancon, France &quot;When I go home, I go to Le Vin et L&apos;Assiette in Besan\u00e7on and order p\u00e2t\u00e9 de campagne, a big chunk of crusty bread and a glass of wine. The restaurant is honest, simple, and a wonderful place. It has fantastic wine cellars with local wines that people would never have heard of.&quot; 97 rue Battant, Besan\u00e7on, France, 0033 3 81 81 48 18 34. Best place to eat: Ice creamCorrado Costanzo, Noto, Sicily The legend about Romans making the earliest ice creams from the snows of Mount Etna may be apocryphal, but Sicily is still the best place for frozen treats in gelato-crazed Italy, and Italian ice cream, as everybody knows, is the finest in the world. (Gelato is made with considerably less butterfat than the heavier American variants, for starters.) Corrado Costanzo&apos;s pastry shop can be found in the crumbling baroque town of Noto, in the south-eastern corner of the island. We defy you to find an ice better than his transcendent mandarin-orange granita. Via Silvio Spaventa 7, Noto, Sicily, 0039 931 835 243 35. Best place to eat: KebabsBade Miya, Mumbai An entire Mumbai street gets overrun, nightly, by pilgrims to an unassuming grilled-food vendor on a pavement behind the Taj Hotel. People hunch over rickety outdoor tables, or the hoods of their cars, to gorge on cheap, basic but spectacular kebabs, roti rolls and drumsticks hot from the grill. The chicken tangdi kebab is especially delicious. Tulloch Road, Apollo Bunder, Mumbai, India 36. Best place to eat: RavioliBabbo, New York &quot;I love the oxtail ravioli with black truffles and pigeon liver sauce at Babbo in New York, my favourite restaurant. It is a simple neighbourhood Italian, but it has a wonderful atmosphere . The only problem is that the restaurant is so busy you have to book a month in advance.&quot; 110 Waverly Place, New York, 001 212 777 0303, www.babbonyc.com 37. Best place to eat: PrawnsCasa Bigote, Sanlucar de Barrameda, Spain &quot;The logo of this restaurant is actually a prawn, and they get their seafood from little dayboats. They serve the local Sanlucar prawn, which is mild and sweet, a bit like a tiger prawn but pinker. They do mantis shrimps too \u2013 prehistoric-looking things which taste like white crab meat. They steam them, and really needn&apos;t do anything else.&quot; Restaurante Casa Bigote, Bajo de Guia, 10, Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda, C\u00e1diz, Andaluc\u00eda, 0034 956 36 26 96/956 36 32 42 38. Best place to eat: CurrywurstKonnopke&apos;s Imbiss, Berlin The German obsession with currywurst \u2013 800m portions of chopped sausage with sweet curry sauce are consumed each year \u2013 reaches its zenith in Berlin, where countless diners and roadside stalls vie for the currywurst crown. It&apos;s hard to improve on Konnopke&apos;s, which has been serving superlative sausage since 1930 under raised train tracks in Prenzlauerberg. Consume with fries and a cold bottle of Berliner Pilsner for maximum impact. Sch\u00f6nhauser Allee 44a, Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin, 0049 30 442 7765, www.konnopke-imbiss.de 39. Best place to eat: HamCasas, Aracena, Spain &quot;Aracena, 40 minutes north of Seville, feels like a frontier town, because north of it is an area the size of Wales of nonstop forest. Here groups of men disappear for months at a time harvesting the cork bark and tending the oak so the iberico pig may gorge on acorns. Black foot ham from nearby Jabugo is some of the finest in the country, and there is nothing better than sitting down in any of the bars and restaurants in Aracena to a plate of this rich delicacy, sliced and served with unpretentious understanding. Last time we were there we had a memorable revueltos (scrambled eggs) with setas (local wild mushrooms) and jam\u00f3n at Casas.&quot; Calle Colmenetas 41, Aracena, Huelva, Spain, 0034 959/128044 40. Best place to eat: Chocolate cakePierre Herme, Paris &quot;When Pierre Herm\u00e9 first let me try his heart-shaped Chuao cake, made with blackcurrants and a chuao couverture from Pralus, I totally forgot where I was. It was a firework of aromas, temperatures and textures. The freshness of the fruit flirted with the roundness of the chocolate. Herm\u00e9 is a genius \u2013 one of my chocolate gods. The cake is seasonal and available on demand, and now made with Valrhona, but it is still my favourite in the world.&quot; 72, rue Bonaparte, Paris, 0033 01 43 54 47 77, www.pierreherme.com 41. Best place to eat: Fried potatoesBomba Bar Cova Fumada, Barcelona &quot;It&apos;s an ancient place, with a marble bar on which they note down what you&apos;ve had with chalk. Father and son run the bar, while the grandmother and mother look after the stove. Go for the bomba, crushed potato balls with minced meat, bread-crumbed and deep-fried with a spicy sauce.&quot; No 56 Carrer del Baluard, Barceloneta, Barcelona, Spain, 0034 93 221 4061 42. Best place to eat: OctopusTholos, Symi, Greece &quot;On my most recent trip to the Dodecanese islands, outside a tiny taverna in Symi port that overlooked the beautiful bay, we ate monster 4kg octopus cooked in its own water then barbecued and brushed with the juice from the cooking. It was super-tender and crunchy on the outside. The flavours were incredibly intense \u2013 the juice had been flavoured with rosemary, garlic and olive oil. The best time to eat octopus here is May or late September.&quot; Gialos, Symi 85600, Islands, Greece, 0030 22460 72033 43. Best place to eat: BouillabaisseRestaurant de Bacon, Antibes, France &quot;The most powerful experience I ever had with a bouillabaisse (Proven\u00e7al fish stew) was at this restaurant by the sea in Antibes. The place itself is nothing fancy but it&apos;s very famous for this dish, and people travel a long way for it. They kill you with the price \u2013 it costs an arm and a leg \u2013 but it&apos;s worth it. They use fish from the region that&apos;s been caught that same morning, and bouillabaisse is their speciality: they do it better than anyone else on this planet. It&apos;s really an experience.&quot; 688 Boulevard de Bacon, 06160 Cap D&apos;Antibes, France, 0033 4 93 61 50 02, www.restaurantdebacon.com 44. Best place to eat: Steak and kidney pieThe Hinds Head, Bray     Heston Blumenthal in his pub, The Hinds Head. Photograph: Karen Robinson    Heston Blumenthal made hundreds of different versions of steak and kidney pie before deciding that oxtail gave the preferred meaty kick.

Best place to eat: PastaTrattoria Caprini, Verona, Italy &quot;This little restaurant in Verona makes the most beautiful pasta in the traditional way, rolling it into wafer thin sheets before cutting it into the various shapes. The pasta is rich and eggy with a slightly tough texture that ensures that it doesn&apos;t turn sloppy when cooked. We went recently and loved the pasta so much we bought some back for the chefs at the restaurant. It was so delicious that they ate it with just some olive oil \u2013 the pasta spoke for itself.&quot; 9 Via Paolo Zanotti, Torbe di Negrar di Volpolicella, Verona, Italy, 0039 0457500511, www.trattoriacaprini.it 46. Best place to eat: CevicheSankuay, Lima, Peru The ceviche craze has gone global in recent years (it now graces the menu at London&apos;s Nobu), but to really experience Peru&apos;s national dish of raw fish cured in lime juice and hot pepper, you have to venture into the backstreets of Lima. The title of best cebecheria is hotly contested in the Peruvian capital. Javier Wong&apos;s Sankuay undoubtedly has the greatest sense of theatre. There&apos;s no sign outside, and the building in the anonymous Balconcillo district turns out to be the chef&apos;s own home. There are only 10 tables, and no menu. Wong&apos;s cebiche, made with lenguado (a type of sole) and accompanied by octopus discs rather than the usual choclo (white maize) and camote (sweet potato), is out of this world. Garcia Leon 114 (between block 3 and 4 of Av Canada), Santa Catalina, La Victoria, Lima, Peru, 0011 51 1 470 6217 47. Best place to eat: Suckling pigMontimar, Estellencs, Mallorca &quot;This restaurant is in the tiny village of Estellencs in Mallorca, where our mother grew up. Every time we come to visit we eat here \u2013 you actually have to walk through the terrace of the restaurant to get to our house. The suckling pig is delicious.&quot; Pla\u00e7a Constituci\u00f3 7, 07192 Estellencs, Mallorca, 0034 971 618 576 48. Best place to eat: CurryKarim&apos;s, Delhi In a beehive of rooms off a hectic Old Delhi bazaar, the Zahiruddin family, which once cooked for Mughal emperors, has been serving sumptuous curries and grilled meats since 1913. The butter chicken curry, served in a rich tomato sauce, is as much a landmark as the colossal Jama Masjid at the end of the street. Devotees swear it&apos;s the best curry in India and therefore, naturally, the world. Jama Masjid, Gala Kababian, Old Delhi, India, 0091 11 2326 9880, www.karimhoteldelhi.com  49. Best place to eat: Dim sumLuk Yu Tea House, Hong Kong &quot;Hong Kong is the best place for dim sum, and Luk Yu Tea House is a Hong Kong institution. It feels very authentic, and the dim sum they do is of an extremely high quality (it&apos;s incredible how they&apos;ve managed to keep both the quality and the authenticity). The menu hasn&apos;t really changed since it opened in 1933. You get things here you won&apos;t get anywhere else. They buy the best Chinese ham and grill it in small slices as an appetiser \u2013 amazing with a glass of red wine. And they still do incredible egg tarts.&quot; 24-26 Stanley Street, Central, Hong Kong, 00852 2523 5464 50. Best place to eat: RamenRamen Jiro, Tokyo &quot;People in Japan always say ramen (Japanese noodle soup) can&apos;t be this and can&apos;t be that. Ramen Jiro is very non-traditional, in your face, take it or leave it. You either love it or hate it, but people who like it are good people. It&apos;s got pork, it&apos;s got cabbage, it&apos;s got garlic, and the sauce is sweet. It&apos;s gnarly. There are several branches; my favourite is the one near Keio University.&quot; 2-14-11 Mita, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan  WITH THANKS TO Fergus Henderson, St John, LondonAnthony Demetre, Arbutus, Soho Skye Gyngell, Petersham Nurseries, Richmond, Surrey Rowley Leigh, Le Caf\u00e9 Anglais, LondonOliver Rowe, Konstam at the Prince Albert, London Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers, The River Caf\u00e9, London.

Recruited to manage City after four seasons at Blackburn Rovers, Hughes said he made the move because he believed City were in a good financial position under Thaksin and that money would be available to sign players. &quot;The reality wasn&apos;t exactly what was described and sold to me,&quot; he said. &quot;In fairness, we were able to go into the transfer market, but there seemed a focus that players had to be sold, and I realised that maybe the resources weren&apos;t in place that I thought.&quot; As Hughes prepares his team for the season&apos;s first Manchester derby tomorrow, the club have granted the Guardian unprecedented access to tell the behind-the-scenes story of the takeover that made City the richest football club on earth. Sir Alex Ferguson has described City as &quot;cocky&quot; this week, but Hughes revealed his feelings were anything but when he first arrived there last year. He described the facilities at City&apos;s Carrington training ground as &quot;rundown&quot; and &quot;not fit for purpose&quot;. There was, he said, &quot;confusion and miscommunication&quot; about players who might be sold, with Stephen Ireland told he would be leaving when Hughes had not approved any decision to sell him. Thaksin already had $2bn of assets frozen and faced corruption charges in Thailand when he took over City in 2007, and on 10 August 2008, he and his wife, Potjaman, skipped bail after Potjaman was convicted of fraud in Bangkok and sentenced to three years in prison. Hughes said that at the time he tried to concentrate solely on managing the football club, hoping his job would not be affected by Thaksin&apos;s problems. &quot;Probably naively, I thought you could separate the two, but obviously you can&apos;t.

Contemplating the view from the blue-cushioned seats in the directors box at the City of Manchester Stadium, Khaldoon might have been expected to be pretty content with what had been inherited: Mark Hughes&apos; side helped themselves to a 6-0 feast and J\u00f4, the Brazilian striker signed that summer from CSKA Moscow for \u00a319m, even scored one of the goals. Mansour had accompanied his takeover with an open letter to City fans, still the only public statement he has made about an acquisition which has since transformed the club and shaken the Premier League&apos;s established hierarchy. In it Mansour introduced &quot;my friend&quot; Khaldoon, whose credentials were set out: chief executive of the Mubadala Development Company and chairman of the Executive Affairs Authority, which provides strategic advice to the Abu Dhabi government. Mansour&apos;s letter promised to &quot;build a team capable of sustaining a presence in the top four of the Premier League and winning European honours&quot;. There were three votes of confidence in Hughes&apos; ability to manage that transformation. The letter also pledged that fans would be listened to by the new owner \u2014 &quot;we are very aware that without you there would not be a club to buy&quot; \u2013 to honour the club&apos;s history, ensure the academy continued to develop even while star names were being signed, and to continue City&apos;s &quot;contribution to the community&quot;. These days Khaldoon, the executive chairman Garry Cook and all the senior people at City argue that for all the headline signings \u2013 Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Tevez, Gareth Barry, Joleon Lescott, Roque Santa Cruz and the other established players procured in an aggressive year of huge spending \u2013 they have striven to stay true to those promises. Contrary to how he might have been expected to feel, watching a 6-0 victory at his first game, Khaldoon was seriously unimpressed by what he found at the club in the first instance, particularly the pitches and facilities at the Carrington training ground. Hughes had joined in June 2008, after four high-achieving seasons at Blackburn Rovers. Kia Joorabchian, who first became known to English football as the representative of the unnamed investors who &quot;owned&quot; the economic rights of Tevez and Javier Mascherano, was playing a central role advising City, and he was instrumental in recruiting the manager. The club were owned by Thaksin Shinawatra, the deposed prime minister of Thailand who bought City for \u00a321.5m in June 2007 from the previous shareholders, most substantially the founders of JD Sports, John Wardle and David Makin. Thaksin, who was removed from office in a military coup during 2006, had by then been charged with corruption offences in his home country and had US$2bn of his assets frozen \u2014 yet still City&apos;s directors approved the sale. Hughes, in an interview with the Guardian, now admits he was aghast at the state City were in when he took over from Sven-Goran Eriksson in June 2008. &quot;I made the switch from Blackburn because I thought City was a club with potential, in a good financial position, and there would be money available,&quot; he reflected ruefully. &quot;The reality wasn&apos;t exactly what was described and sold to me. In fairness we were able to go into the transfer market, but there seemed a focus that players had to be sold, and I realised that maybe the resources weren&apos;t in place that I thought.&quot; The Carrington facilities were also not as he had expected, bearing no evidence of investment. &quot;The training ground was not fit for purpose,&quot; Hughes recalled plainly. &quot;I was quite shocked by how run down it was. Blackburn Rovers is a good club, well-run and organised, it has top-drawer facilities as a consequence of the money Jack Walker invested, and I made the assumption \u2026&quot; he paused. &quot;That was my failing last year; I made too many assumptions. I assumed that people and facilities would be top quality and it was patently obvious they weren&apos;t.&quot; Deals to sign players were already well-advanced when he arrived, including J\u00f4. There was, Hughes said, &quot;confusion and miscommunication&quot; about players who might be sold, and he had to address the first-team squad to tell them he was in charge of football affairs, and not to listen to anything they were told by anyone else. &quot;Whether they believed me or not at that stage is open to debate,&quot; he grimaced. On late 2008 Thaksin and his wife, Potjaman, skipped bail in Thailand and became fugitives after Potjaman was convicted of tax evasion in Bangkok and sentenced to three years in prison. Hughes, throughout it all, said he tried to stay in the football bubble, hoping that Thaksin&apos;s public problems would not affect the money available or work to be done. &quot;Probably naively, I thought you could separate the two,&quot; he reflected, quietly, &quot;but obviously you can&apos;t. &quot;If you are single-minded, you have to work purposefully, and if you get to a point where it is untenable and not manageable, then you make the decision to walk away. I never got to that point \u2014 but,&quot; he shrugged, &quot;I was close.&quot; Cook had joined from Nike \u2013 reccommended by Joorabchian; they knew each other because Nike used to have Corinthians&apos; kit deal. Publicly Cook was seen as an apologist for Thaksin, after a disastrous interview he gave at the fag end of the regime, in which he delivered the lines which always haunt him. &quot;Is he [Thaksin] a nice guy?&quot; Cook had asked rhetorically. &quot;Yes. Is he a great guy to play golf with? Yes. Does he have plenty of money to run a football club? Yes. I really care only about those three things. Whether he is guilty of something over in Thailand, I can&apos;t worry. My role is to run a football club.&quot; Speaking before City&apos;s first home game this season, against Wolves, Cook addressed that character reference he gave for Thaksin, who was subsequently convicted of two corruption offences in absentia, and has allegations of serious human rights abuses long laid against him by Amnesty International. &quot;I feel dreadful about having said it,&quot; Cook said, making eye contact and looking genuinely, emotionally, contrite. &quot;I have made some mistakes in my life, but I deeply regretted my failure to do proper research on Thaksin.&quot; It all came out wrong, Cook winced. He had been trying to express the idea that he could not be deflected by Thaksin&apos;s political problems, which were outside his control. &quot;The charges did not seem real,&quot; Cook said. &quot;It felt like a political situation Thaksin had run away from. I did not want it to affect the day-to-day running of the football club but I was being enlightened on a daily basis.&quot; In fact, Cook revealed, his own job had become a living nightmare as he too realised Thaksin&apos;s money was frozen but the people, and infrastructure, were not in place. Cook felt that the job he had been brought to do, to lead a &quot;renaissance&quot; of City, was impossible, and that &quot;the fabric of the football club had been taken away&quot;. He soon realised there was no money; City borrowed from Standard Bank against Premier League TV money not yet received, and bought players on deposit. &quot;Thaksin&apos;s money was locked away. Every bit of revenue was being accelerated and the players were being mortgaged. We got into a position where we couldn&apos;t pay the players \u2013 and John Wardle [the former chairman who had sold his shares and left the board] was asked to lend the club \u00a32m. I was working stupid hours to make sure I was not missing anything; I was living in this paranoia.&quot; Cook had been tempted away after 13 years at Nike&apos;s headquarters in Portland, Oregon, working his way through sales, and international business development, to latterly become president of the Jordan brand. He had been earning handsomely, and he came to believe he had made the biggest mistake of his life. &quot;My wife had packed up everything in our house in the States, the furniture was in transit, and I sat in my hotel room in Cheshire crying down the phone. I felt I had unravelled everything, undone all my hard work, because I had been seduced into this role. I realised I had taken my family into the lion&apos;s den.&quot; Vincent Kompany, the then 22-year-old Belgian centre-half, arrived from Hamburg for \u00a36m to further his ambitions, and, sitting recently in the revamped Carrington, surrounded by the new stellar signings, he recalled the turmoil he found at City. &quot;At the time I signed I was supposed to meet the owner, but then I was told he had to cancel it to go into hiding somewhere. It was a bit of a funny situation.&quot; Stephen Ireland, now 23 and who had come over from Cork to join the academy at the age of 14 \u2013 after being invited for trials at every Premier League club \u2013 said he felt immediately comfortable at City, a &quot;family club&quot;, but the period under Eriksson&apos;s management had been too lax, and became bizarre when the club&apos;s owner turned fugitive. &quot;When Thaksin took over everybody thought it was going to be massive, and it wasn&apos;t,&quot; Ireland remembered. &quot;There was no stability, people weren&apos;t sure what was round the corner. It was mad, that somebody like that, who was on the run and had been convicted of corruption, could own our football club, for our careers to be in his hands. Everybody was wondering what&apos;s next. Thankfully we got a new owner.&quot; Hughes was playing in the City academy&apos;s golf day at the Marriott hotel in Worsley, Salford&apos;s leafy suburb, when he began to receive phone calls telling him that Sulaiman al-Fahim had announced an Abu Dhabi takeover of the club. Sky News arrived to trail Hughes round the course and by the end of the day City had signed Robinho, a move the manager approved. He recalled al-Fahim bragging about City signing gal\u00e1cticos, fuelling the richest-club-in-the-world label. &quot;I knew from the beginning we could not rise to that expectation,&quot; the manager said. &quot;We didn&apos;t have the right players, we didn&apos;t have the right quality. It took a while, but the new owners recognised that talking like that was not the way they like to do business. They wanted to make an impact, and did so by signing Robinho, but the statements after that did not reflect Abu Dhabi in a good light and that is when Khaldoon was asked to come in and take over.&quot; Khaldoon first met Hughes when he flew in to Manchester and they went for a meal at an Italian restaurant, Stocks. Both quiet, intense and driven characters, they were mutually impressed. Hughes then took his new chairman on the grand tour around decrepit Carrington. &quot;I must say I was extremely surprised,&quot; Khaldoon recalled. &quot;I took a tour with Mark and I couldn&apos;t believe what I saw. It was not the minimum level of infrastructure required for a top-tier club. &quot;When I returned I immediately went to Sheikh Mansour, showed him pictures of the facility and he was very straight to say, &apos;this is unacceptable&apos;. There were some quick fixes, quick wins, we could do at City, like fixing the gym, the medical facility \u2013 we had to do it quickly, because it was simply unacceptable.&quot; Changing the squad and the culture which, Hughes believed, was too slack, would take longer, but the Abu Dhabi owners pulled in contractors they knew and the gym and treatment rooms were overhauled in four weeks. Where before there were a handful of stationary bikes, a couple of treadmills, no dedicated weights room and desultory gloom, now there are 20 bikes, all the weights and the multi-gym Hughes&apos; staff wanted for training and rehab, a six-bed medical centre, refurbished hydrotherapy plunge baths, a new kit room, and motivational messages slapped optimistically on the walls. One is Muhammad Ali&apos;s famous quote: &quot;The fight is won or lost far away from witnesses, behind the lines, in the gym and out there on the road, long before I dance under those lights.&quot; Khaldoon was also taken aback by the holes he found in the organisation. A businessman schooled in corporate systems, chief executive of an Abu Dhabi fund with more than $10bn of government assets under investment, he found City had no personnel department, no finance director. &quot;I found it shocking,&quot; he reflected. &quot;In the famous Premier League, to run without basic functions like these. I&apos;ll be frank, I expected it to be more structured. One of the big surprises was how amateurish it was.&quot; After Mansour&apos;s takeover there was relentless speculation that he would sack Hughes and replace him with a marquee name like Jose Mourinho, the assumption being that Mansour&apos;s votes of confidence would prove as worthless as they notoriously have been from homegrown chairmen. It was widely thought that Cook would go too, but in fact Mansour and Khaldoon quickly decided that Cook, like Hughes, was one of the biggest assets they had inherited. Both men flew to Abu Dhabi to meet Mansour in the early weeks after the takeover. They spoke in the grounds of the sheikh&apos;s palace. Hughes remembered they talked for an hour, about Hughes&apos; approach as a modern manager, which includes dedicated sports science and performance-analysis departments, his desire to build a no-excuses culture around the players, the positions where the squad needed strengthening. &quot;We left,&quot; recalled the manager, &quot;and within an hour of driving back to the hotel, Khaldoon had a phone call from Sheikh Mansour saying we have to put something out on the [news] wires, that I had a complete mandate to carry on. That was a huge boost.&quot; Khaldoon denies they ever considered sacking Hughes, whom he believes will become &quot;a great manager&quot;, or that any ultimatums were given, despite grim patches of form in the months before the January transfer window. They also retained Cook, whom they believe has the ambition, and ability, to reconstruct City&apos;s operation into one befitting a truly top club. &quot;No question, Garry knows, and will say he didn&apos;t start on the right foot,&quot; Khaldoon smiled. &quot;People make mistakes. But I could feel there was more good than mistakes. People say we took a gamble and a bet \u2014 not really. It only took a couple of meetings for me to see what Garry was about and what he could do for this club.&quot; The chairman of Manchester City then turned again to the way in which the club links with the far greater responsibility he shoulders, for the strategic direction of Abu Dhabi, and the image, and the values the emirate seeks to embody. &quot;We believe in loyalty,&quot; he said. &quot;We don&apos;t leave our men behind, we stick with them. We went through difficult times last season, but we all faced it together. And now, I hope, we are looking at a brighter future.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-09-18T23:10:11Z", "tags": ["Manchester City", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/sep/19/inside-manchester-city-david-conn", "title": "How the takeover of Manchester City came just in time to rescue a club in disarray", "sentences": ["On late 2008 Thaksin and his wife, Potjaman, skipped bail in Thailand and became fugitives after Potjaman was convicted of tax evasion in Bangkok and sentenced to three years in prison."]}, {"article": "Mark Hughes has revealed that he came &quot;close&quot; to walking away from Manchester City in the summer of 2008, frustrated by the lack of money, &quot;confusion&quot; and turmoil at the tail end of the club&apos;s ownership by Thaksin Shinawatra, the former prime minister of Thailand. Recruited to manage City after four seasons at Blackburn Rovers, Hughes said he made the move because he believed City were in a good financial position under Thaksin and that money would be available to sign players. &quot;The reality wasn&apos;t exactly what was described and sold to me,&quot; he said. &quot;In fairness, we were able to go into the transfer market, but there seemed a focus that players had to be sold, and I realised that maybe the resources weren&apos;t in place that I thought.&quot; Hughes, whose side face the first Manchester derby of the season tomorrow, was disappointed with the facilities at City&apos;s Carrington training ground, which he described as &quot;rundown&quot; and &quot;not fit for purpose&quot;.

However City&apos;s chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, who was appointed by Mansour, said there had been &quot;an immediate chemistry&quot; with Hughes. Khaldoon said he believes Hughes will be &quot;a great manager&quot; and they had confidence in him from the beginning. &quot;It was very unfair what he had to face all of last season,&quot; the chairman said. &quot;And that to a certain extent made me feel stronger towards him. Last season was very difficult, but we wanted Mark to succeed.&quot; Khaldoon said that after &quot;a couple of meetings&quot; he also recognised Cook&apos;s qualities, and ability to handle the reconstruction of City desired by Mansour. &quot;People make mistakes,&quot; he said, of Cook&apos;s golfing reference for Thaksin, &quot;but to me there was more good than there were mistakes.

For the first time, Hu promised to set a target for reducing the rate at which China&apos;s greenhouse gas emissions are rising. The pledge to reduce China&apos;s so-called carbon intensity means total emissions will still grow, but the fossil fuel burned for each rise in economic growth will fall by a &quot;notable margin&quot; by 2020, compared with 2005 levels. It represents a concession to rich nations such as the US who were demanding some kind of action before taking on deep cuts themselves. &quot;Out of a sense of responsibility to the world and its people,&quot; Hu said, China has tackled climate change and will continue to do so. UN secretary Ban Ki Moon thanked Hu for his &quot;important commitment&quot; but Hu failed to set a figure for the intensity cut, or a date by which China&apos;s total emissions would start falling. Hu reiterated China&apos;s goal of 15% of its energy to be renewable by 2020, to plant 40m hectares of trees and to offer aid to the poorest developing nations facing the impacts of climate change. A few moments before, US President Barack Obama had spoken strongly on the need to act on global warming but offered no new proposals that could jumpstart stalled talks on a UN climate pact. He faces severe opposition at home against proposed laws to cut US emissions. In his speech, Obama said time was running out to address the problem. &quot;Our generation&apos;s response to this challenge will be judged by history, for if we fail to meet it \u2014 boldly, swiftly, and together \u2014 we risk consigning future generations to an irreversible catastrophe,&quot; he said. &quot;The time we have to reverse this tide is running out.&quot; Observers had hoped the United States and China \u2014 the world&apos;s biggest polluters \u2014 would inject momentum, just over two months before 190 nations gather in Copenhagen aiming to complete a climate treaty. Moon, who called the unprecedented meeting, said talks were moving too slowly. &quot;Failure to reach broad agreement in Copenhagen would be morally inexcusable, economically short-sighted and politically unwise,&quot; Ban said. But Michael Levi, from the Council on Foreign Relations in the US, was disappointed with Hu&apos;s speech. &quot;Doesn&apos;t seem that he made the much-anticipated significant announcement that people were hoping for,&quot; he tweeted. Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that shared the Nobel Peace Prize with former vice president Al Gore in 2007 had reminded the leaders that &quot;the science leaves us with no room for inaction now.&quot; Yesterday, India&apos;s environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, told the Guardian his government planned to make &quot;aggressive&quot; cuts in India&apos;s emissions, placing additional pressure on rich nations to respond by agreeing deep cuts. Today&apos;s UN summit and the G20 summit in Pittsburgh later this week have been seen as a last chance for world leaders to accelerate the complex negotiations.

China, India and Japan, along with the private sector, all made positive and significant contributions at the summit. Hu Jintao, the Chinese president, made specific commitments on curbing the growth in greenhouse gas emissions as China continues its extraordinary economic growth. While the president promised a reduction by a &quot;notable margin&quot; rather than a specific figure, there is no doubt that the cut will be significant. And the environment ministers of both China and India made important and constructive proposals for how their countries will reverse deforestation. This was the kind of leadership I had hoped to see at the summit \u2013 organised by Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general \u2013 with developing and emerging countries showing that they can tackle climate change while continuing their efforts to reduce poverty. But we still have a long way to go before we can be sure that a strong agreement is in place for Copenhagen. In the next couple of years, annual emissions of greenhouse gases are likely to reach a level of 50 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. If we are to have a reasonable chance of avoiding a rise in global average temperature by more than 2C, annual emissions have to be cut to no more than 20 gigatonnes by 2050. That means that the 9 billion people who will be living on the planet in 2050 must be producing, on average, no more than about two tonnes of greenhouse gases per year each. At the moment, the rich industrialised countries of the European Union average about 10-12 tonnes per head of population, while the figure for the United States is almost 24 tonnes. China, by contrast, emits about 6 tonnes per head at present. Thus rich industrialised countries in particular must substantially reduce their emissions. The developed countries must now demonstrate that they have the political will to reach a strong agreement in Copenhagen. In New York, Japan&apos;s new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, outlined how his country will reduce its emissions by 25% by 2020, compared with 1990. This was a positive example that few others matched. President Obama has already committed to a cut of 80% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, compared with 1990. But the American Clean Energy and Security Act passed by the House of Representatives sets an interim target for 2020 that is not considered ambitious enough by many other countries. And it is not clear when, or even if, the Senate will pass a comparable act to reduce emissions. It is these interim targets that should now be addressed by all countries during the coming weeks. If we are to reach the goal of reducing emissions to 20 gigatonnes by 2050, we must be at about 35 gigatonnes by the halfway point of 2030. That means global emissions have to peak within the next five years and be steadily falling by 2020. And while the commitments by the largest emitters already on the table for 2020 offer significant cuts relative to today&apos;s emissions, they collectively fall 4 or 5 gigatonnes short of what is necessary if we are to be on a realistic trajectory to reach the 2030 and 2050 targets. Developing countries should also sharply reduce their emissions \u2013 but they must be supported, financially and through technology sharing with the rich industrialised countries. Without commitments to such support, the negotiations ahead will prove very difficult. Although the political leaders must devise and implement the right policies to guide national and global emissions trajectories, it is the private sector that will be the main engine in the transition to a low-carbon global economy. In that respect it was very encouraging that 181 investors, collectively responsible for the management of more than $13 trillion in assets globally, launched a statement in New York last week to support a global agreement on climate change. The Leadership Forum for business leaders, which ran alongside the summit, also highlighted a tremendous variety of innovative ideas from within the private sector for the low-carbon transition. So there are some reasons to be more optimistic about the prospects for securing a strong agreement in Copenhagen, following the New York summit. But the obstacles that remain are very big and will require an even stronger effort to overcome, starting at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh and continuing during the coming round of treaty negotiations in Bangkok next week. There must be real vision, leadership and creativity, as well as a mutual understanding of the difficulties of making and implementing domestic policies. But if we can muster the effort, we can, as a world, forge a path towards a more prosperous and sustainable future \u2013 for us, our children, and generations to follow.", "publicationDate": "2009-09-23T20:30:02Z", "tags": ["Climate change", "Climate change", "Copenhagen climate change conference 2009", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "China", "India", "Obama administration", "Environment", "US news", "United Nations", "Japan", "Global climate talks", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/sep/23/climate-change-copenhagen-china-india", "title": "China and India are leading the way.

What exactly happened to the Arctic Sea, the enigmatic cargo ship allegedly seized by pirates, not off the wild coast of Somalia but in the genteel EU waters of the Baltic? Two months after the ship was &quot;hijacked&quot;, the answer is now clear \u2013 at least according to Russian investigators. Last week, they announced they had finished their probe into one of the biggest maritime puzzles since another ill-starred merchant ship, the Mary Celeste, was found drifting, crewless, in the Atlantic. And according to Moscow, the story is reassuringly simple. Eight armed &quot;pirates&quot; seized the Arctic Sea in the late evening of 24 July, off the coast of Sweden. The pirates told the captain to sail for Africa. The Arctic Sea then slipped through the Channel and &quot;disappeared&quot; on or around 30\u00a0July, prompting a frantic international search. Three weeks later, on 17\u00a0August, a Russian naval frigate found and intercepted the boat some 300 miles off the Cape Verde Islands. Russian officers arrested the &quot;pirates&quot;, who turned out to be a bunch of ethnic Russians from Estonia and Latvia. They also freed the Arctic Sea&apos;s 15 Russian crew members. This bold mission, the Kremlin claims, involving ships, military aircraft and other resources, was a national triumph. There&apos;s only one problem with Moscow&apos;s version of events: it just doesn&apos;t stack up. Sitting in his Moscow office, Konstantin Baranovsky \u2013 lawyer for one of the &quot;pirates&quot; \u2013 calmly recounts an alternative reality. His client is Dmitry Bartenev, a 41-year-old sailor who was born and lives in Estonia&apos;s capital, Tallinn. His grandfather was a Soviet admiral, his father worked for the Soviet commercial fleet. Bartenev, his lawyer says, paints a completely different picture of events surrounding the Arctic Sea. There was no hijacking, and he is not a pirate. Instead, Bartenev claims that he and his seven colleagues are harmless &quot;ecologists&quot; who had been working for an unnamed organisation. &quot;He&apos;s told me what that organisation is, but he won&apos;t let me disclose it. I\u00a0don&apos;t know why,&quot; says Baranovsky. Bartenev&apos;s account, relayed by his lawyer, goes like this. On 24 July, he and his colleagues set off before dawn from the Estonian summer beach resort of P\u00e4rnu. Heading off into the grey and choppy Baltic Sea in their soft-hulled inflatable dinghy, they were testing a new GPS unit. But the expedition turned out to be a terrible mistake. &quot;Suddenly a big wave hit us,&quot; Bartenev told his lawyer from prison. &quot;Water flooded our navigation system and broke it. Our engine started to work badly. We lost our bearings. Then it got dark. We saw two ships up ahead of us. One of them was a big passenger liner \u2013 but it was going too fast. The other was the Arctic Sea. It had a low hull. We headed for it.&quot; According to Bartenev, the Arctic Sea&apos;s crew plucked his seven friends from their stricken boat while he stayed at the wheel. Finally they rescued him, then winched on board his battered dinghy. &quot;The crew were very friendly. When they realised we were Russians, they took us to the saloon bar and cracked open a bottle of vodka. There was a lot of booze on the Arctic Sea: whisky and strong alcohol of all kinds.&quot; Bartenev says he asked the captain to put them ashore at the nearest port \u2013 but the request was refused without explanation. So with no immediate prospect of getting off, they relaxed. Russian investigators have portrayed their three weeks on board the Arctic Sea as a tense hostage drama. In fact, Bartenev says, it was more like a jolly P&amp;O cruise \u2013 with swimming, sunbathing and drinks under a twinkling tropical sky. &quot;There was a swimming pool; the crew had improvised it at the bottom of the ship. We swam in it. There was also a gym, which we were allowed to use. We spent a lot of time sunbathing,&quot; Bartenev says. &quot;We slept in a small cabin. We made friends with several engineers and the cook. He cooked for us together with everybody else.&quot; Crucially, Bartenev says he had no idea that the ship was, by now, at the centre of an international search. Having set off on 22 July from the Finnish port of Jakobstad with a cargo of timber, the Arctic Sea was, according to Moscow, supposed to reach the port of Bejaia in Algeria, on 4 August. &quot;We didn&apos;t realise it had gone missing,&quot; Bartenev insists. He and his colleagues did, however, notice that the ship was veering several thousand miles in the wrong direction, down the west coast of Africa. &quot;It got warmer. We\u00a0were clearly heading south,&quot; he told his lawyer. This muggy equatorial odyssey finally ended at lunchtime on 17 August, when the Russian naval frigate, the Ladny, came alongside. The Arctic Sea&apos;s crew had spotted the heavily armed vessel two days previously and, according to Bartenev, its ominous appearance prompted his new companions to nervously break out the vodka again. &quot;We spent the last two nights on board getting drunk with the crew,&quot; he explains. Strangely, the Arctic Sea&apos;s captain informed the pursuing Russians that his vessel was North Korean. But this merely delayed the inevitable \u2013 an order to come aboard the Ladny. At 11.41am, Russian personnel arrested Bartenev. They took him and the other &quot;pirates&quot; to a military airport on the Cape Verde islands. From there, he was whisked by Ilyushin Il-76 military plane to Moscow, chucked in jail and charged with kidnapping and piracy. Eleven of the Arctic Sea&apos;s sailors were also flown back to Moscow for interrogation, and subsequently barred from talking to the press. The captain, Sergei Zaretsky, and three others stayed behind. One month later they are still on the boat, which instead of heading back to Russia has been kept out of view somewhere near the Canary Islands. Baranovsky describes Russian investigators&apos; account of the drama as &quot;ludicrous&quot;. He poses the obvious question: why would anybody want to hijack a ship full of wood? &quot;The official version of the incident isn&apos;t true. It looks like eight mad guys took a rubber boat, went into the centre of the Baltic Sea, and grabbed a ship full of lumber. It&apos;s not only strange, it&apos;s unbelievable.&quot; Of course, Bartenev&apos;s story also appears dubious in places, especially his claim to be an ecologist. (The sailor has two &quot;Celtic&quot; tattoos on his upper arms \u2013 not very Greenpeace.) Nonetheless, his testimony \u2013 with its credibly banal account of life on board the Arctic Sea \u2013 blows a hole in the official version of events. His suggestion that there was no hijacking, and that the crew were at\u00a0no stage under duress, is backed by the official investigators&apos; concession that there\u00a0were, in fact, no weapons on board the Arctic Sea. A more likely scenario is that Bartenev and his fellow &quot;pirates&quot; were set up. But by whom? Over the past month, speculation has swirled in Russian and British papers that the Arctic Sea was carrying a secret consignment of S-300 anti-aircraft interceptors, destined for Tehran. Israel is opposed to Iran&apos;s acquisition of any anti-aircraft weapon that could thwart an Israeli air strike on Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities, and suspicion of a government cover-up grew last week when Israel&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, made a secret dash to Moscow. The Kremlin and Netanyahu&apos;s office initially denied that he had visited Russia \u2013 only to confirm later that he had surreptitiously dropped in by private jet. A subsequent report in the Sunday Times, citing Israeli intelligence sources, suggested that Israel&apos;s intelligence service, Mossad, had set up Bartenev and his gangster friends to &quot;hijack&quot; the ship, to force the Russian government&apos;s hand and prevent the S-300s from reaching Iran. But this version of events, though attractive, is ultimately implausible too. Defence experts sniff that a large, complex anti-aircraft system such as the S-300 simply can&apos;t be stuffed inside an old shipping container. &quot;It&apos;s bullshit,&quot; one expert tells me bluntly. Furthermore, Russia&apos;s president, Dmitry Medvedev, told CNN last Sunday that he didn&apos;t have a problem with flogging weapons to Iran, so long as they were for defensive purposes. Russia has a contract to supply Tehran with S-300s, but so far has not delivered them. Speaking from Tallinn, Bartenev&apos;s brother Alexey yesterday had another, more prosaic explanation for who &quot;framed&quot; the Arctic Sea eight. Alexey says a mysterious businessman named &quot;Vladimir&quot; recruited Bartenev and his seven friends in mid-July. &quot;My brother had been out of work for six months. Suddenly &apos;Vladimir&apos; offers him a job. The pay is good, more than \u20ac1,000 a month. But there&apos;s no written contract.&quot; According to Alexey, Bartenev moved to P\u00e4rnu on 16 July. He and a group of friends he&apos;d known since sailing school went on training exercises. They camped on the shore. &quot;Vladimir&quot; also gave them a rubber-hulled boat with an outboard motor. The job apparently involved whizzing round the Baltic Sea, filming tankers as they chucked rubbish overboard \u2013 an environmental role, in fact. Alexey is adamant his brother isn&apos;t a pirate. &quot;He&apos;s not at all aggressive. He&apos;s extremely sociable, a lovely guy,&quot; he says. Secret arms deal? To add to all the intrigue, prosecution documents seen by Baranovsky show that another, shadowy group of visitors also dropped in on the Arctic Sea on 22 July \u2013 two days before Bartenev says he conked out in his dinghy. These visitors were a group of between 22 and 24 men who arrived by speedboat, and spent 12\u00a0hours on board the Arctic Sea. Some reports say they tied up and blindfolded the crew, having posed as drug enforcement officers; others that they dressed up as Swedish police. What they were doing there is unclear. Based on what he has read, Baranovsky says: &quot;They looked like Russian special forces.&quot; The revelation adds further weight to the most compelling scenario \u2013 that someone within Russia&apos;s intelligence or security community was using the Arctic Sea to illegally smuggle weapons. The ship had spent several weeks in Kaliningrad, Russia&apos;s freewheeling Baltic Sea exclave \u2013 the perfect place to hide a secret cargo (as well as stock up on cheap vodka). But the nature of that cargo is unclear: some have suggested rockets, others smart bombs. One Estonian commander says cruise missiles. Certainly, Russia&apos;s spy agencies have an established network of trusted contacts in the Middle East, dating back from when the communist Soviet Union covertly sponsored much of the Arab world with arms and ammunition. And these days, its spy agencies are as much about private profit as intelligence activity. The Kremlin&apos;s rival factions have long been locked in a deadly struggle not only for influence, but for revenue streams amounting to billions of dollars. If the Arctic Sea was carrying an illegal cargo as part of a rogue business deal, it appears that someone in government decided to cover it up. Revelations that Russia had been involved in secret arms trading would be deeply embarrassing. A pretend hijacking appears to have been the solution. It is, after all, the perfect pretext for the Russian authorities to board the Arctic Sea and quietly retrieve its cargo, and to justify a lavish air-and-sea rescue mission. Earlier this month, the journalist who first broke the story of the Arctic Sea&apos;s strange &quot;disappearance&quot; fled Russia after receiving a menacing late-night phone call. Mikhail Voitenko, editor of the online maritime bulletin Sovfracht, said an unidentified caller warned him he was &quot;stepping on the toes of some serious people&quot;. I spoke to Voitenko last week. At the time he was hiding in Istanbul; now he has gone to ground in Bangkok. He recalled how the anonymous caller bluntly informed him that he had offended powerful, possibly criminal, interests \u2013 adding that &quot;certain people are out for revenge&quot;. Voitenko said, &quot;I was told: &apos;These guys are very unhappy with you. But they don&apos;t want unpleasantness.&apos;&quot; \u00ad Instead, he was warned to leave the country. Voitenko said he didn&apos;t know the identity of his mystery caller, but hinted that the man who spoke with a &quot;chilling voice&quot; was from the FSB, Russia&apos;s many tentacled post-KGB spy agency. Asked what was really hidden on board the Arctic Sea, Voitenko was guardedly cryptic, replying: &quot;Half of those involved in this were private individuals. But half were linked with the state.&quot; And asked why the Arctic Sea affair had snowballed into an international incident, he added dryly: &quot;You don&apos;t normally get attacks on ships in the Baltic.&quot; Last week, his employers announced that they had fired him; he\u00a0is now writing for the opposition newspaper, Novaya Gazeta. Bartenev&apos;s current residence, meanwhile, is Moscow&apos;s Lefortovo prison, Russia&apos;s most notorious lock-up. The prison is under the control of the FSB; only VIPs or those involved in politically sensitive cases get to stay here. On Monday, Baranovsky asked a court to bail Bartenev, arguing that Russia had no jurisdiction when it grabbed him in international waters from a Maltese-registered vessel. Predictably, the judge said no. Bartenev made a virtual appearance in court via a video link. He looked thoroughly fed up, sticking out his elbows in disgust. Barring a miracle, the &quot;pirates&quot; are destined to remain in prison for a long time. The crew of the Arctic Sea have been told to keep their mouths shut. Russian reporters attempting to talk to the crew&apos;s families have met a wall of scared silence. This is not the first time individuals have been sacrificed to the opaque interests of the Russian state; nor is it likely to be the last.", "publicationDate": "2009-09-23T23:05:01Z", "tags": ["Piracy at sea", "Russia", "Finland", "World news", "Estonia", "Europe"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/24/arctic-sea-russia-pirates", "title": "Was the cargo ship Arctic Sea really hijacked by pirates?", "sentences": ["At the time he was hiding in Istanbul; now he has gone to ground in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "A few weeks after my 17th birthday, I took a bus to the M4 motorway and stuck out my thumb.

That &quot;freedom&quot; is now gone, but only if you want it to be. With a clever tie-up of technologies \u2013 global positioning system (GPS), digital mobile phone networks and online maps \u2013 a pair of British entrepreneurs have developed a system for monitoring the location of a mouse-sized transmitter in theory anywhere in the world. The Traakit &quot;satellite alerting device&quot; was originally developed to monitor the location of valuable items. But it&apos;s already been used at least once to keep an eye on a gap-year teenager. I know plenty of parents who would cough up \u00a3400-odd (the cost of the hardware plus a year&apos;s subscription) for the same sliver of reassurance. Another notch up the one-way ratcheted scale to a panopticon society? Perhaps. But, as ever, a plea to keep things in perspective. Technical limitations would seem to restrict the Traakit&apos;s use beyond the laudable one of keeping tabs on valuable property. For a start, no GPS signal is going to tell your folks if you are spending your evenings in a language school or the opium den next door to it. Indeed, GPS signals can&apos;t even be received inside substantial concrete or steel buildings, or even railway carriages and as soon as you&apos;re properly off the beaten track there&apos;s no mobile phone signal anyway. Regardless, who in their right mind would want to keep such tight tabs on their errant offspring? OK, so they&apos;re plastered in Bangkok or having wild sex on an Australian beach. Exactly what are you going to do about it? Jump on the next flight with a box of Alka-Seltzer or a refresher course on condom use? Surely on these occasions ignorance is truly bliss. Think about it. What if your parents had known about every drinking den, nightclub or bike shed that provided your teenage entertainment? Rather than being the truly balanced individual that you are now, you&apos;d still be wondering where babies came from. Some panopticon. I wish the system&apos;s inventors well, and look forward to the price dropping a bit so I can fit one on my bike. And more importantly, on my daughter&apos;s too. Will she have any say in the matter? I honestly don&apos;t know. Earlier, I deliberately put the word freedom in inverted commas.

That was when life without football felt so shapeless and empty. There would always be an invite to some game. There was a bit of television work kicking about. But when you have been in the game for nearly 40 years football can feel like a drug and Peter Reid, as a self-confessed addict, was missing his fix. &quot;I&apos;d been in football since I was 15 at Bolton Wanderers and then, when you find yourself out of it, the first couple of days are OK but, after that, bloody hell, it&apos;s hard work,&quot; he says. &quot;You go two weeks and it is already driving you crackers. You wake up, you haven&apos;t got any football problems, life should be great but, bloody hell again, what do you do?&quot; Reid asked himself that question many times during those years in the wilderness when English football seemed to have spat him towards retirement a decade or so before he was planning it himself. He ended up taking a job 6,000 miles away, managing the Thailand national team, and wondered when he would ever get another chance in the Premier League. &quot;I was always linked with jobs. The bookies had me on their shortlists and the newspapers would link me with all sorts of positions. But I never got one. In the end, that&apos;s why I went to Thailand. I just wanted to be back in football.&quot; Then Stoke City came calling. Tony Pulis wanted an assistant and Reid fitted the bill. The two men saw each other at a football dinner, and got talking. A few days later, Reid took a phone call. Today, he will be in the dugout as Manchester United visit the Britannia Stadium. &quot;Tony just asked if I wanted to come down to the club and have a chat about it. He wanted someone who had experience of the Premier League. Plus he knew I wouldn&apos;t be a yes-man. He knows I have got my opinions, and that&apos;s a useful thing for a No2 because it&apos;s no good just agreeing with everything. You have to bounce ideas off each other. I came down to have a look at the club and it didn&apos;t take long to say yes. &quot;The manager is very hands-on, enthusiastic, a good coach. His relationship with the chairman [Peter Coates] is strong, which is the most important thing at any club. The supporters are brilliant. The training facilities are going up, there are plans to develop. It&apos;s a progressive club. OK, it&apos;s difficult to compete in the Premier League when you look at the big four and what Aston Villa, Tottenham and Man City are doing, but it is a club going in the right direction. There is just this atmosphere, this feelgood atmosphere. I&apos;ve been in football a long time and it hits you in the face.&quot; He was a year into a four-year contract with Thailand, living in an apartment in Bangkok, learning the basics of the language. The &quot;War Elephants&quot; are currently 115th in Fifa&apos;s world rankings but Reid oversaw a noticeable improvement in their results, despite all the disadvantages of starting from scratch. &quot;I didn&apos;t even know the players&apos; names when I arrived so I had to call them by their numbers. Then I found out they all had nicknames so I ended up writing them down and trying to memorise them. I had a goalkeeper called &apos;Boy&apos;. There was &apos;Bird&apos;, &apos;Car&apos;, &apos;Mooey&apos;, &apos;Cop&apos;, &apos;Coal&apos; and we got around it that way. I got my bootson sometimes to join in the training if I was struggling to make a point. And we did well.&quot; Reid had to adapt to a new culture. &quot;I did my homework and I was told you can&apos;t give them a bollocking like you can here. In England, some players can take a bollocking, some can&apos;t. But over there it was a cultural thing. They called it &apos;face&apos; \u2013 if you embarrassed them they lost face, and that was very important to them. I&apos;d get frustrated sometimes but I just had to rein it in.&quot; Thailand reached the semi-finals of the Asian Championship and Reid was pleasantly surprised about the standard of play. But there was always that itch to re-establish himself in England&apos;s top division and a sense that he deserved that chance. &quot;My record at Man City was fifth, fifth and ninth. At Sunderland, it was seventh, seventh and fourth from bottom. It&apos;s not bad. I don&apos;t know how chairmen think, but I&apos;m not sure they always analyse things deeply enough.&quot; His last job in England ended with Coventry City in 20th position in the Championship in January 2005, an appointment he now regards as a &quot;mistake&quot; to have accepted. Before then, Reid had tried to save Leeds United from being shipwrecked, at a time when the club reeked of boardroom buffoonery and bad organisation. He is 53 now, and has had to battle an unfair perception that he is resolutely old-school. &quot;You can easily get tagged but I think some of the old-school philosophies are great so I won&apos;t be apologising for them. Funnily enough, so does Sir Alex Ferguson. When you haven&apos;t got the ball, you work to get it back. And when you&apos;ve got it, you pass it. Simple. They were Bill Shankly&apos;s principles, Harry Catterick&apos;s at Everton, the School of Science. But you never stop learning in football, and there&apos;s a modern way of thinking \u2013 the diets, the video analysis, the scientific programmes. In Thailand I got them on a core stability programme. I taught them about diets and nutrition, that chilli beef and fried rice isn&apos;t a great pre-match meal. I&apos;ve taken all that on board. It&apos;s just that people have a perception of you.&quot; Contrary to &quot;Wikipedia&apos;s bollocks&quot;, Reid never registered to become a football agent during his time out of work. He had a property business to take care of. A popular member of the managerial set, there were many invites to watch games. He was a good pundit too, full of opinion and analysis. But he missed the day-to-day involvement. It irked him that Premier League clubs would rather look abroad for managers. &quot;We&apos;ve had [Luiz Felipe] Scolari at Chelsea, [Alain] Perrin at Portsmouth, [Juande] Ramos at Spurs. Look how they have done. For every foreign manager that does well, there are just as many who don&apos;t. And it means there are a lot of British managers who don&apos;t get a chance. That&apos;s a bugbear but, listen, the other thing I know is that football doesn&apos;t owe you anything. There are better people than me out of work so you just get on with it.&quot; So what has changed in that gap of almost five years? &quot;The players are athletes now, proper athletes. It&apos;s quick, definitely quicker. The pitches are fantastic now as well. Even the training pitches \u2013 Premier League, Championship, every level. But there are bugbears. I see crosses going in too easily [he was at the Manchester derby last weekend] and it irritates me. I tell defenders: &apos;How about stopping the source?&apos; &quot;And it annoys me that [Michel] Platini wants to take physical contact out of the game. A good tackle still gives me as much pleasure as watching a great dribble or a brilliant pass. And what people don&apos;t understand is that it is killing the art of dribbling. The dribblers, the crowd-pleasers, want defenders to try to tackle them so they can try to get round them. If there are no tackles, it is taking away the dribbling and that&apos;s one of the things people love to see.&quot; His voice is rising with indignation. &quot;I see some great tackles these days given as fouls. Patrice Evra on Michael Ballack [in the Community Shield], great tackle \u2013 yellow card. Darren Fletcher on Cesc F\u00e1bregas in the Champions League semi-final, another great tackle \u2013 penalty, and he misses the final for it. Absolute bollocks!&quot; He could talk about this subject for hours, as enthused and impassioned as always. Football can be like a fairground ride sometimes, lots of twists and turns, exhilarating highs, excruciating lows. Reid will always be that boy on thefront seat, hands in the air, wanting to go round again. &quot;We&apos;ve got Manchester United this weekend. I&apos;m looking around, and I&apos;m thinking money can&apos;t buy this feeling.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-09-25T23:11:29Z", "tags": ["Stoke City", "Football", "Premier League"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/sep/26/peter-reid-stoke-city-interview", "title": "Peter Reid and the lure of that three o'clock feeling", "sentences": ["I&apos;ve been in football a long time and it hits you in the face.&quot; He was a year into a four-year contract with Thailand, living in an apartment in Bangkok, learning the basics of the language."]}, {"article": "Huge dust storms, like the ones that blanketed Sydney twice last week, hit Queensland yesterday and turned the air red across much of eastern Australia, are spreading lethal epidemics around the world. However, they can also absorb climate change emissions, say researchers studying the little understood but growing phenomenon. The Sydney storm, which left millions of people choking on some of the worst air pollution in 70 years, was a consequence of the 10-year drought that has turned parts of Australia&apos;s interior into a giant dust bowl, providing perfect conditions for high winds to whip loose soil into the air and carry it thousands of miles across the continent. It followed major dust storms this year in northern China, Iraq and Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, east Africa, Arizona and other arid areas. Most of the storms are also linked to droughts, but are believed to have been exacerbated by deforestation, overgrazing of pastures and climate change. As diplomats prepare to meet in Bangkok tomorrow for the next round of climate talks, meteorologists predict that more major dust storms can be expected, carrying minute particles of beneficial soil and nutrients as well as potentially harmful bacteria, viruses and fungal spores. &quot;The numbers of major dust storms go up and down over the years,&quot; said Andrew Goudie, geography professor at Oxford University. &quot;In Australia and China they tailed off from the 1970s then spiked in the 1990s and at the start of this decade. At the moment they are clearly on an upward trajectory.&quot; Laurence Barrie is chief researcher at the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) in Geneva, which is working with 40 countries to develop a dust storm warning system. He said: &quot;I think the droughts [and dust storms] in Australia are a harbinger. Dust storms are a natural phenomenon, but are influenced by human activities and are now just as serious as traffic and industrial air pollution. The minute particles act like urban smog or acid rain. They can penetrate deep into the human body.&quot; Saharan storms are thought to be responsible for spreading lethal meningitis spores throughout semi-arid central Africa, where up to 250,000 people, particularly children, contract the disease each year and 25,000 die. &quot;There is evidence that the dust can mobilise meningitis in the bloodstream,&quot; said Barrie. Higher temperatures and more intense storms are also linked to &quot;valley fever&quot;, a disease contracted from a fungus in the soil of the central valley of California. The American Academy of Microbiology estimates that about 200,000 Americans go down with valley fever each year, 200 of whom die. The number of cases in Arizona and California almost quadrupled in the decade to 2006. Scientists who had thought diseases were mostly transmitted by people or animals now see dust clouds as possible transmitters of influenza, Sars and foot-and-mouth, and increasingly responsible for respiratory diseases. A rise in the number of cases of asthma in children on Caribbean islands has been linked to an increase in the dust blown across the Atlantic from Africa. The asthma rate in Barbados is 17 times greater than it was in 1973, when a major African drought began, according to one major study. Researchers have also documented more hospital admissions when the dust storms are at their worst. &quot;We are just beginning to accumulate the evidence of airborne dust implications on health,&quot; said William Sprigg, a climate expert at Arizona University. The scale and range of some recent dust storms has surprised scientists. Japanese academics reported in July that a giant dust storm in China&apos;s Taklimakan desert in 2007 picked up nearly 800,000 tonnes of dust which winds carried twice around the world. Dust from the Gobi and Taklimakan deserts is often present over the western United States in the spring and can lead to disastrous air quality in Korean, Japanese and Russian cities. It frequently contributes to the smogs over Los Angeles. Britain and northern Europe are not immune from dust storms. Dust blown from the Sahara is commonly found in Spain, Italy and Greece and the WMO says that storms deposit Saharan dust north of the Alps about once a month. Last year Britain&apos;s Meteorological Office reported it in south Wales. Some scientists sought to attribute the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak to a giant storm in north Africa that carried dust and possibly spores of the animal disease as far as northern Britain only a week before the first reported cases. The scale and spread of the dust storms has also surprised researchers. Satellite photographs have shown some of the clouds coming out of Africa to be as big as the whole land mass of the US, with a major storm able to whip more than a million tonnes of soil into the atmosphere. Sydney was covered by an estimated 5,000 tonnes of dust last week, but the WMO says Beijing was enveloped by more than 300,000 tonnes in one storm in 2006. &quot;The 2-3 billion tonnes of fine soil particles that leave Africa each year in dust storms are slowly draining the continent of its fertility and biological productivity,&quot; said Lester Brown, director of the Earth Policy Institute research group in Washington DC. &quot;Those big storms take millions of tonnes of soil, which takes centuries to replace.&quot; Brown and Chinese scientists say the increased number of major dust storms in China is directly linked to deforestation and the massive increase in numbers of sheep and goats since the 1980s, when restrictions on herders were removed. &quot;Goats will strip vegetation,&quot; said Brown. &quot;They ate everything and dust storms are now routine. If climate change leads to a reduction in rainfall, then the two trends reinforce themselves.&quot; China is planting tens of millions of trees to act as a barrier to the advancing desert. However, research increasingly suggests that the dust could be mitigating climate change, both by reflecting sunlight in the atmosphere and fertilising the oceans with nutrients. Iron-rich dust blown from Australia and from the Gobi and Sahara deserts is largely deposited in oceans, where it has been observed to feed phytoplankton, the microscopic marine plants that are the first link in the oceanic food chain and absorb large amounts of carbon dioxide. In addition, the upper layers of the rainforest in Brazil are thought to derive much of their nutrient supply from dust transported across the Atlantic from the Sahara. Just as scientists struggle to understand how dust is affecting climate, evidence is growing that another airborne pollutant, soot, is potentially disastrous. Minute particles of carbon produced by diesel engines, forest fires and the inefficient burning of wood in stoves is being carried just like dust to the remotest regions of the world. A study by the United Nations Environment Programme has just concluded that the pollutant has played a major part in shrinking the Himalayan glaciers and has helped to disrupt the south Asian monsoon. &quot;Soot accounts from 10% to more than 45% of the contribution to global warming,&quot; said Achim Steiner, director of the UN&apos;s environment programme. &quot;It is linked to accelerated losses of glaciers in Asia because soot deposits darken ice, making it more vulnerable to melting.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-09-26T23:07:59Z", "tags": ["Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Australia weather", "Infectious diseases", "Microbiology", "Meteorology", "Climate change", "Agriculture", "Environment", "World news", "Drought", "Desertification", "Climate change", "Sydney"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/27/dust-storms-diseases-sydney", "title": "Dust storms spread deadly diseases worldwide", "sentences": ["As diplomats prepare to meet in Bangkok tomorrow for the next round of climate talks, meteorologists predict that more major dust storms can be expected, carrying minute particles of beneficial soil and nutrients as well as potentially harmful bacteria, viruses and fungal spores."]}, {"article": "India&apos;s prime minister today signalled a huge push in nuclear power over the coming decades, using an untested technology based on nuclear waste and the radioactive element thorium. Manmohan Singh, speaking at a conference of atomic scientists in Delhi, announced that 470,000MW of energy could come from Indian nuclear power stations by 2050 \u2014 more than 100 times the current output from India&apos;s current 17 reactors. &quot;This will sharply reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and will be a major contribution to global efforts to combat climate change,&quot; he said, adding that Asia was now seeing a huge spurt in nuclear plant building. The Indian plan, which relies on untested technology, was criticised by anti-nuclear campaigners as &quot;a nightmare disguised as a dream&quot;. The prime minister said a breakthrough deal with the US, sanctioned by the international community, had opened the door for the country to &quot;think big&quot; and meet the demands of its billion-strong population. He did not say how much the plans would cost, or how they would be paid for. The intervention comes as talks in Bangkok aimed at resolving the impasse between developing and developed countries over a new climate change deal to replace the Kyoto protocol have stalled. India, one of the world&apos;s biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, has been dismayed that its pledges of action \u2013 including a dramatic expansion of nuclear power - have been met with inaction from richer nations. The prime minister&apos;s statement also brings Delhi alongside Beijing which has long promoted atomic energy. India&apos;s plan would see it leapfrog its northern neighbour. At present China has 11 reactors in operation producing 8,000MW but has proposed that by 2020 this output be increased 10-fold. The UK, by contrast, has an installed capacity of around 12,000MW, much of which is due to go offline and be replaced by a new fleet of reactors in the next decade. Nuclear power has been a contentious issue in India. Although the country has had a decades-old atomic programme, it was effectively blacklisted from global civilian nuclear trade after testing a nuclear device in 1974. That embargo was lifted in 2008 after negotations with Washington. The result has been a rush to sign deals \u2013 both to supply uranium and to build reactors. France, Russia and the United States have all sought access to the booming Indian market. India has an ambitious three-stage nuclear programme which it sees as a &quot;silver bullet&quot; to its dire energy shortage. At present 400m people cannot light their homes and the country imports 70% of its oil. Delhi says that it will be able to surmount these considerable problems and generate clean green power with an atomic programme that &quot;virtuously recycles&quot; the plutonium waste that reactors produce. This radioactive isotope takes thousands of years to be rendered safe and dealing with it is the greatest challenge facing nuclear energy&apos;s proponents. The Indian plan turns this waste into fuel. Using thorium, which is abundant in the country, combined with plutonium, the country aims to produce power and &quot;breed&quot; stockpiles of uranium. It is a technology that no other country has mastered \u2013 and many have dropped \u2013 but India still has more than 2,000 scientists working on the technical problems. Singh said the country had entered &quot;stage two&quot; of the programme and had completed a prototype breeder reactor in southern India. However campaigners said &quot;if climate change is the problem, nuclear power is not the answer&quot;. SP Udayakumar, convenor of India&apos;s Alliance for Anti-Nuclear Movements, questioned whether the technology India was pushing would ever be ready. &quot;The nuclear technology the prime minister talks about is not proven. If we start going ahead then the issue is the amount of carbon emitted by building, maintaining, operating and decommissioning nuclear plants means that (nuclear power) is a hugely polluting technology. If it does not work then we are left with waste that takes 24,000 years to become safe. It is a gamble we will pay for generations to come.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-09-29T12:29:27Z", "tags": ["Nuclear power", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "India", "Environment", "Climate change", "Energy", "World news", "Fuel poverty"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/sep/29/nuclear-power-thorium-india", "title": "India plans to cut carbon and fuel poverty with untested nuclear power", "sentences": ["The intervention comes as talks in Bangkok aimed at resolving the impasse between developing and developed countries over a new climate change deal to replace the Kyoto protocol have stalled."]}, {"article": "Twenty-five million more children will go hungry by the middle of this century as climate change leads to food shortages and soaring prices for staples such as rice, wheat, maize and soya beans, a report says today. If global warming goes unchecked, all regions of the world will be affected, but the most vulnerable \u2013 south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 will be hit hardest by failing crop yields, according to the report, prepared by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) for the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. The children of 2050 will have fewer calories to eat than those in 2000, the report says, and the effect would be to wipe out decades of progress in reducing child malnutrition. The grim scenario is the first to gauge the effects of climate change on the world&apos;s food supply by combining climate and agricultural models. Spikes in grain prices last year led to rioting and unrest across the developing world, from Haiti to Thailand. Leaders at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh last week committed $2bn (\u00a31.25bn) to food security, and the United Nations is set to hold a summit on food security in November, its second since last year&apos;s riots. But the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, is pressing the World Bank and other institutions to do more. He said the industrialised world needs to step up investment in seed research and to offer more affordable crop insurance to the small farmers in developing countries. Though prices have stabilised, the world&apos;s food system is still in crisis, he said at the weekend. &quot;Ever more people are denied food because prices are stubbornly high, because purchasing power has fallen due to the economic crisis, or because rains have failed and reserve stocks of grain have been eaten,&quot; he said. Even without global warming, rising populations meant the world was headed for food shortages and food price rises. &quot;The food price crisis of last year really was a wake-up call to a lot of people that we are going to have 50% more people on the surface of the Earth by 2050,&quot; said Gerald Nelson, the lead author of the report. &quot;Meeting those demands for food coming out of population growth is going to be a huge challenge \u2013 even without climate change.&quot; After several years in which development aid has been diverted away from rural areas, the report called for $7bn a year for crop research, and investment in irrigation and rural infrastructure to help farmers adjust to a warming climate. &quot;Continuing the business-as-usual approach will almost certainly guarantee disastrous consequences,&quot; said Nelson. The G20 industrialised nations last week began discussing how to invest some $20bn pledged for food security earlier this year. Some regions of the world outlined in the report are already showing signs of vulnerability because of changing rainfall patterns and drought linked to climate change. Oxfam yesterday launched a $152m appeal on behalf of 23 million people hit by a severe drought and spiralling food prices in Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and Uganda. The charity called it the worst humanitarian crisis in Africa for a decade, and said many people in the region were suffering from malnutrition. But southern Asia, which made great advances in agricultural production during the 20th century, was also singled out in the IFPRI report for being particularly at risk of food shortages. Some countries, such as Canada and Russia, will experience longer growing seasons because of climate change, but other factors \u2013 such as poor soil \u2013 mean that will not necessarily be translated into higher food production. The report was prepared for negotiators currently trying to reach a global deal to fight climate change at the latest round of UN talks in Bangkok. It used climate models prepared by the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Colorado and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Australia to arrive at estimates of how changes in growing seasons and rainfall patterns would affect farming in the developing world and elsewhere. Without an ambitious injection of funds and new technology, wheat yields could fall by more than 30% in developing countries, setting off a catastrophic rise in prices. Wheat prices, with unmitigated climate change, could rise by 170%-194% by the middle of this century, the report said. Rice prices are projected to rise by 121% \u2013 and almost all of the increase will have to be passed on to the consumer, Nelson said. The report did not take into account all the expected impacts of climate change \u2013 such as the loss of farmland due to rising sea levels, a rise in the number of insects and in plant disease, or changes in glacial melt. All these factors could increase the damage of climate change to agriculture. Others who have examined the effects of climate change on agriculture have warned of the potential for conflict. In a new book, Plan B 4.0: Mobilising to Save Civilisation, published today, Lester Brown, founder of the Earth Policy Institute, warns that sharp declines in world harvests due to climate change could threaten the world order. &quot;I am convinced that food is indeed the weak link,&quot; he said. Brown saw Asia as the epicentre of the crisis, with the latest science warning of a sea level rise of up to six feet by 2100. With even a 3ft rise, Bangladesh could lose half of its rice land to rising seas; Vietnam, the world&apos;s second largest producer of rice, could also see much of the Mekong Delta under water. Wheat and rice production would also fall because of acute water shortages, caused by past over-pumping and the melting of the Himalayan glaciers, which currently store water that supplies the region&apos;s main rivers: the Indus, Ganges, and Yangtse. Brown said: &quot;The potential loss of these mountain glaciers in the Himalayas is the most massive projected threat to food security ever seen&quot; . Global shortfall People in both the developing and developed worlds will have less to eat by 2050 if climate change is not seriously addressed, though the shortfall will be relatively slight in richer countries. Prices rises and shortages of food will drive down the average calories available: \u2022 The calories available for each person in industrialised nations will fall from 3,450 in 2000 to about 3,200. \u2022 In developing countries overall, the average will fall from 2,696 to 2,410 calories. \u2022 In sub-Saharan Africa, people will on average have only 1,924 calories a day, compared with 2,316 in 2000.", "publicationDate": "2009-09-30T03:30:00Z", "tags": ["Food", "Climate change", "Environment", "World news", "Aid and development", "Katine", "Malnutrition"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/sep/30/food-crisis-malnurtrition-climate-change", "title": "By 2050, 25m more children will go hungry as climate change leads to food crisis", "sentences": ["The report was prepared for negotiators currently trying to reach a global deal to fight climate change at the latest round of UN talks in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Fifty metres (165ft) above a Thai lagoon, ankles bound and secured to a bungee cord, Rishi Baveja shuffled to the edge of a small platform and threw himself off.

As 180 countries started a second week of talks, the developing countries showed their deep frustration at the slow pace of the negotiations on a global climate deal, which are planned to be concluded in two months&apos; time in Copenhagen. &quot;The reason why we are not making progress is the lack of political will by Annex 1 [industrialised] countries. There is a concerted effort to fundamentally sabotage the Kyoto protocol,&quot; said ambassador Yu Qingtai China&apos;s special representative on climate talks. &quot;We now hear statements that would lead to the termination of the protocol. They are introducing new rules, new formats. That&apos;s not the way to conduct negotiations,&quot; said Yu. Yu&apos;s was echoed by Lumumba Di-Aping, Sudanese chair of the G77, the UN&apos;s largest intergovernmental organisation of developing states which represents 130 countries at the talks. &quot;Feelings are running high in the G77. It is clear now that the rich countries want a deal outside the Kyoto agreement. It would be based on a total rejection of their historical responsibilities. This is an alarming development. The intention of developed countries is clearly to kill the protocol,&quot; he said. The angry statements follow a revelation by Barack Obama&apos;s energy adviser, Carol Browner, that she did not expect the US Senate to vote on its crucial global warming bill before the Copenhagen talks. That will severely limit Obama&apos;s room for manoeuvre at the summit and is the first time the White House has made such an admission. The G77 plus China group is incensed that rich countries appear to be seeking to establish a new agreement that would force developing countries to cut emissions, but allow rich countries to do little. In the talks, the US has said it wants a new approach which would move away from a legally binding world agreement to one where individual countries pledged cuts in their national emissions without binding timetables and targets. It is a change from the top down approach of Kyoto, in which total emissions targets are determined by the science, to one in which individual countries pledge their own emissions cuts. This is seen as undermining the Kyoto framework, which took many years to build, and has until now been the foundation for committing all countries to cut their emissions. The US team in Bangkok declined to respond to today&apos;s criticism. Developed countries have so far refused to show their hand on what their emission cuts should be. The UN&apos;s Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change has estimated that to keep below a 2C rise in temperatures they need to cut their emissions by 25-40% by 2020, compared with 1990 levels. But developing countries are calling for an aggregate cut of at least 40%. But with fewer than 10 days of formal negotiations left before the Copenhagen talks begin, poor countries are complaining that they are being expected to cut emissions but the US and others are being allowed to get away with minimal cuts. The UN estimates that the combined cut from national pledges made by rich countries, without the US, comes to 16-23%. However, a new analysis by the Alliance of Small Island States, estimates that this drops to just 11-18% with the US&apos;s present offer. If rich countries are allowed to offset large amounts of emissions, as expected, this would mean that the world&apos;s rich countries might not to have to make any emissions cuts at home. Several of the world&apos;s largest developing countries including China and India, Indonensia and Mexico have indicated that they are ready to make significant emissions cuts. &quot;The United States wants only to have a national target without binding it to a global treaty. It appears to have won over many other developed countries,&quot; said Martin Khor, the director of the South Centre, a think tank of poor countries based in Geneva. &quot;They are stressing that developing countries have &apos;common&apos; responsibilities, a code for pulling in the developing countries into emission-reduction obligations, while down-playing the &apos;differentiated&apos; responsibilities that recognise that the developing countries have had little role in the historic emissions and need space for economic development.&quot; Ed Miliband, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, said he remained optimistic that a deal could be struck at Copenhagen, despite the increase in tension in Bangkok. He said he was confident heads of state would be able to succeed in December where their official negotiators had apparently so far failed. &quot;This is really too important to be left to formal negotiators. If we are to get an agreement we need leaders, who can knock heads together,&quot; Miliband said, speaking in Moscow, where he is on a two-day official visit. He told the Guardian: &apos;If we treat this like a conventional negotiation we are going to fail...

No. Here in sweaty Bangkok and the chilly air-conditioned UN centre, it&apos;s cool to be secretive. We the people \u2013 that is the press, the NGOs, even business - are not allowed to see or hear any of the negotiating sessions. And our EU leaders plan just one short session with the world&apos;s media on Friday afternoon when the talks here finish. Seeing as the EU stands accused by the developing world of jeopardising the whole shebang by siding with the United States to sabotage the Kyoto protocol, perhaps secrecy is their only option. Even the big NGOs like to be close to power and to be secret. Earlier today, the US called an impromptu open meeting to discuss the talks so far, but the Guardian, along with other press here was thrown out. &quot;On what basis does the US refuse to tell the world what it is deciding?&quot; we asked. The US representatives looked embarrassed and shrugged. But when the NGOs were asked if they wanted the media to be allowed to stay, they too declined. So much for civil society, which gets ever cosier with its masters. So Guardianistas, here is the official state of play with just a few weeks to go until the final round of talks which begin in Copenhagen on 7 December. So far, the UN has said rich countries need to cut their emissions by 25-40% by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels) to stay within the 2C rise which the scientists say is the upper limit of what Earth can take. But the UNFCCC secretariat (the people running the climate talks) reckons that the combined cut from pledges made by rich countries so far adds up to just 16-23% - and that&apos;s excluding any cuts made by the US. The Alliance of Small Island States (made up of the countries who stand to be drowned in a few years and which have as their motto: &quot;1.5 to stay alive&quot;) say that if the US joins in with its expected target of about 4-10%, that would give an aggregate global cut of just 11-18% in emissions. If so, that means that we, the rich, intend to cut our emissions by a measly 6% more than what we pledged - but failed to reach in 2002. And with carbon offsets - which we can pass on to poor countries - that means we need do next to nothing at all at home. Indeed, we could probably increase emissions and carry on building coal power plants. No wonder the EU and rich countries are hiding from the press and the developing countries are furious! Quote of the conference so far comes from ambassador Yu Qingtai, China&apos;s special representative on climate talks. When asked to do a stock-taking exercise to see how far the talks had come, he said succinctly: &quot;Unfortunately there is hardly any stock to take.&quot; Tragically, one Filipino delegate has had a very personal reminder of the effects of climate change.

The UN, the World Bank, the UK and individuals including Prince Charles have strongly backed UN plans to expand the global carbon market to allow countries to trade the carbon stored in forests. If, as expected, this is agreed at crucial UN climate change talks taking place in Bangkok this week and concluding in Copenhagen in December, up to $30bn a year could be transferred from rich countries to the owners of endangered forests. But experts on all sides of the debate, from international police to politicians to conservationists, have warned this week that the scheme, called Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (Redd), may be impossible to monitor and may already be leading to fraud. The UN itself accepts there are &quot;high risks&quot;. Interpol, the world&apos;s leading policing agency, said this week that the chances were very high that criminal gangs would seek to take advantage of Redd schemes, which will be largely be based in corruption-prone African and Asian countries. &quot;Alarm bells are ringing. It is simply too big to monitor. The potential for criminality is vast and has not been taken into account by the people who set it up,&quot; said Peter Younger, Interpol environment crimes specialist and author of a new report for the World Bank on illegal forestry. &quot;Organised crime syndicates are eyeing the nascent forest carbon market. I will report to the bank that Redd schemes are open to wide abuse,&quot; he said. The significance of the felling of forests across great swaths of the world cannot be overstated - it is are responsible for about 20% of the globe&apos;s entire carbon emissions. With governments anxious to find new ways to meet increasingly stringent national emission targets, a scheme which promises to benefit poor countries, cut emissions cheaply and not require any new technology is highly attractive. But most of the countries rich in forests are also home to some of the world&apos;s most corrupt politicians and uncontrolled logging companies, who stand to make billions of dollars if they can get Redd projects approved. &quot;Fraud could include claiming credits for forests that do not exist or were not protected or by land grabs. It starts with bribery or intimidation of officials, then there&apos;s threats and violence against those people. There&apos;s forged documents too,&quot; said Younger. &quot;Carbon trading transcends borders. I do not see any input from any law enforcement agency in planning Redd.&quot; Hans Brattskar, director of Norway&apos;s forest and climate programme, whose country is financially backing the UN Redd programme, said last night: &quot;It will be extremely difficult to make it work. Law enforcement is vital because the corruption issued are very real. But we have to put in safeguards and we have to try. Redd can save up to 20% of all the world&apos;s emissions. Without it, I believe it will be impossible to reach the target of stemming climate change and holding global temperatures to 2C,&quot; the level judged acceptable by the European Union. Last month, Papua New Guinea, one of the countries pushing hardest for Redd to be accepted in the UN climate talks, suspended their climate change minister after allegations that $100m of fake carbon credits had been handed to communities to persuade them to sign up to forest protection schemes. Last night the UN admitted that Redd schemes were dangerously open to abuse. &quot;Where countries are corrupt the potential for Redd corruption is dangerous. [In Papua New Guinea], people have tried to take advantage of the market in an unacceptable way and carbon cowboys are trying to get the benefits. We can expect more of this as Redd develops,&quot; said Tiina Vahanen, a senior officer at UN-Redd. People setting up Redd schemes also fear that they may be discredited by fraudsters aiming to profit from public money. &quot;The potential for Redd rape and pillage is staggering. Logging companies may turn into carbon companies. All they have to do is count, not cut. It&apos;s like giving a mass murderer money,&quot; said Rob Dodwell, a British conservationist setting up schemes in Kenya and Cameroon. The UN estimates that 25% of the world&apos;s forestry emissions, or nearly 5% of total global carbon emissions, could be saved by 2015 if rich countries invest $15bn to set up Redd schemes. So far rich countries have put up $52m to establish nine official pilot Redd schemes in Asia, Latin America and Africa. In addition several hundred private schemes are being set up by bankers, conservation groups, and businesses who plan to offer carbon credits on the voluntary market. But academics and environment groups with long experience working with the logging industry and indigenous communities said that both government and private schemes are being set up with no guarantees to protect communities who depend on the forests. &quot;Decisions are being rushed, communities are not consulted or compensated and the lure of money from cutting emissions is overiding everything,&quot; says Rosalind Reeve of forestry watchdog group Global Witness.

But the wildlife sanctuary&apos;s guards who risk their lives to defend the animals from poachers now face an even greater danger. Rukinga is on the frontline of global deforestation: every month, dozens of large gangs of commercial charcoal-makers are caught cutting down trees and building crude fire pits to make cooking fuel for the port city of Mombasa 100 miles away. No one knows exactly how many thousands of tonnes of trees are lost a year, but at estimated present rates the reserve could be like much of the land between it and the coast \u2013 semi-desert, treeless and barren of animals \u2013 within 20 years. This could change this week if countries agree to back a revolutionary UN plan to preserve the world&apos;s forests by allowing owners to trade the carbon stored in endangered forests on condition the trees are not felled. The plan aims to slash the 20% of all greenhouse gas emissions that come from deforestation and is one of the few aspects of a global deal to fight climate change that looks on track to be settled, with key talks taking place this week in Bangkok. If the ranch&apos;s owners can show that Rukinga&apos;s trees and shrubs are under threat, and independent scientists can calculate the amount of carbon in its forest, the ranch could qualify as an international Redd (Reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries) project, attracting millions of dollars of carbon credits. The carbon saved would be traded on the growing voluntary carbon market and after 2012 when the next round of the Kyoto treaty becomes affective, Rukinga could qualify as an official Kenyan government Redd scheme, attracting public money from Britain and other rich countries seeking to offset emissions they have legally committed to cut. British conservationist Rob Dodwell and California-based dotcom millionaire Mike Korchinsky, the ranch&apos;s two main shareholders, say they have spent $400,000 (\u00a3251,000) over six months measuring Rukinga&apos;s trees and getting their Redd application validated. Despite the deep concerns of many observers about how open to fraud Redd projects are, the pair are determined to show it can be done properly. The carbon stored has been provisionally estimated at around 160 tonnes an acre, which at the present world price of carbon could earn Rukinga nearly $2m a year \u2014 a big return for land bought only 10 years ago for around $10 an acre. Dodwell and the 50 local community shareholders of Rukinga will continue to earn money from eco-tourism and cattle, but hope to earn a lot more from farming carbon. &quot;We calculate that one third of the money [earned] from carbon will go to protect the forest. One third will be cash, like dividends for shareholders, and one sixth will go to the carbon broker. The rest is profit. About $600,000 would go back into the environment every year to protect the trees. It would secure the jobs of the 150 people who already work on Rukinga and it could lead to 100 more jobs. We would need to employ tree patrols, administrators and others. The local shareholders who own 10% of the ranch would earn a lot of money. The wildlife would benefit from the habitat protection and it would cut climate change emissions,&quot; says Dodwell. The local communities were at first bemused, but are now delighted: &quot;When the idea was proposed, we thought &apos;how can you earn money from air?&apos;. We asked how you could harvest carbon? We wondered if you needed containers,&quot; says Alphonse Mwaidoma, chair of nearby Kasigau ranch. &quot;Now, everyone realises it will change everything. Since 1971 we have never had any benefits from the ranch. We get very small dividends, enough to buy just a few bags of sugar or paraffin. Some of the [new] money would go as dividends; some we would put to long term development of the community and scholarships.&quot; Dodwell and Korchinsky, who are also planning to get a 1.8m acre tract of virgin Cameroonian forest classified as a Redd project, potentially earning themselves and 10,000 forest pygmies who live there nearly $10m a year, say they want local people and wildlife to benefit. But they accept that the Redd system is wide open to be abused by organised crime and corrupt governments and businesses. &quot;There&apos;s a great worldwide scramble going on to find land that would qualify for Redd schemes. But there are no guidelines on how to find out how many tonnes of carbon there are,&quot; says Dodwell. &quot;Redd has the potential to be fantastic for commuities but also to go horribly wrong. Logging companies may turn into carbon companies. In most countries in Africa you can do what you like, log out the trees, put in roads, do anything. There is little or no monitoring. The rewards could be 99% for me and 0.5% for the communities,&quot; he said. There are signs that many nascent Redd projects are already leading to social conflict, possible fraud and worsening land disputes. In July, the director of climate change in Papua New Guinea was suspended following allegations that unofficial carbon credits worth $100m had been issued from 39 potential Redd projects by an Australian-based carbon company. Landowners claimed they had been forced to sign over the rights to their forests by &quot;carbon cowboys&quot;. The scandal is embarrassing because Papua New Guinea, which has a history of rampant, illegal logging, is leading world efforts to have Redd schemes backed at the UN climate change talks which culminate in Copenhagen in December. Elsewhere, Redd projects are widely expected to reward political and commercial elites with billions of dollars of public money, with little or nothing reaching the communities who will be expected to protect the forests. In Indonesia, where 40 million people depend on forests, potential Redd projects are in limbo because much of Indonesia&apos;s forests have never been surveyed, and land ownership is fiercely disputed. Local communities are supposed to earn a share of Redd credit sales to pay for better health, education and alternative livelihoods but out of 144 Redd projects analysed by the International Institute for Environment and Development, only one included a proposal to make community-managed forests or indigenous peoples&apos; rights a binding part of Redd. &quot;The momentum is to get carbon reductions guaranteed above all else. But the overturning of power needed to make Redd work in some countries is almost inconceivable,&quot; said James Mayer, head of the natural resources group at IIED. The Redd rush has been fuelled by conservation groups eager to save emissions but often naive about human rights and development work. US Nature Conservancy, Conservation International, WWF US, Environmental Defense Fund, Woods Hole Research Center, as well as US energy companies, hotel groups, hedge funds, banks and many private buinesses have signed deals with forest owners and are setting up their own Redd schemes. Hans Brattskar, director of Norway&apos;s Forest and Climate Programme whose country is funding the UN-Redd programme, said he envisaged some difficulties could be overcome by sophisticated hi-tech surveillance mixed with on-the-spot monitoring by indigenous peoples. &quot;We know that Redd will needs new laws, land reform and new institutions. But if countries do not perform they will not be paid. This is payment for services. The consequences if we fail are enormous.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 20 October 2009.

A spokesperson for President Obama announced late last week that the United States is unlikely to pass climate change legislation in time for the conference, leaving it with little to bring to the table. Meanwhile, at preparatory negotiations in Bangkok this week, national representatives have argued and admonished each other for &quot;wasting time&quot;, &quot;dancing around the issues&quot; and in one case &quot;putting crap in the text just so you could take it out later&quot;. Yesterday things got even worse as China accused developed nations of trying to &quot;fundamentally sabotage&quot; negotiations. Fortunately this isn&apos;t deal or no deal \u2013 on some issues agreement is possible. But to get there nations must accept that the outcome of Copenhagen will be an uneven and incomplete series of compromises. The bad news is that laggards such as Australia, Canada and the US are going to have to be let off the hook and allowed to pledge to meet targets grossly out of line with their responsibility for climate change. But the political reality is that there is a limit to what they will commit to this year. Push too hard and we face a nightmare scenario where they either lead a race to the bottom, dragging down developed world targets, or just walk away, derailing the process completely. This will, of course, further enrage developing nations, so laggard states must try to find ways to appease the developing world. Most obviously they should make a large contribution to financing what will be an expensive deal. The inadequacy of the range of policies proposed by the US could also be off-set through increased bi-lateral cooperation with China on designing, manufacturing and deploying clean technology, expanding on the memorandum of understanding they signed on climate change earlier this year. It goes without saying that the US must also end hypocritical posturing about China and India and shelve ridiculous threats to impose tariffs on goods from these countries. These kinds of compromises, though imperfect and distasteful, will be acceptable if there is progress on what the Maldives described as the &quot;beefier&quot; issues. Negotiators need to focus their efforts on reaching agreement on reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) and on how to expand the use of clean technology in the developing world. It would also be a significant step forward to begin the process of facilitating financial flows to help the poorest adapt in the face of droughts, floods and crop-failure. Ultimately a focus on the practicalities is better than empty promises about short term targets. The importance of progress on these beefy issues cannot be understated either. Deforestation, for instance, is one of the largest drivers of climate change. To avoid disaster nations must tackle this issue now. Negotiations on forests are at a crucial juncture in Bangkok this week and there is a real possibility that they might go very wrong. The current negotiating text does not explicitly protect intact natural forests and might inadvertently provide financial incentive to those who convert forests to other uses. An agreement at Copenhagen could start a process that initially slows and eventually stops deforestation, but there is a danger that without sufficient attention and pressure, it could perversely encourage it. It is worth remembering that Copenhagen will be just another step forwards, part of an ongoing process of crafting a response to climate change. Ideally this summit will lay the practical foundations for this response. But if nations fail to agree on at least some of these issues this December, then negotiations will become even more of an unyielding morass, which would be a bad thing for everyone.", "publicationDate": "2009-10-06T12:07:04Z", "tags": ["Copenhagen climate change conference 2009", "Climate change", "United Nations", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Deforestation", "Environment", "Global climate talks"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/oct/06/copenhagan-climate-change", "title": "Prepare for a Copenhagen compromise | Tan Copsey", "sentences": ["Meanwhile, at preparatory negotiations in Bangkok this week, national representatives have argued and admonished each other for &quot;wasting time&quot;, &quot;dancing around the issues&quot; and in one case &quot;putting crap in the text just so you could take it out later&quot;.", "Negotiations on forests are at a crucial juncture in Bangkok this week and there is a real possibility that they might go very wrong."]}, {"article": "The US has made the first move to bridge the yawning gulf separating rich and developing countries on the money needed to secure a successful climate change deal at crucial UN talks in Copenhagen this December. Although US negotiators have not made any specific promises on finance at talks currently under way in Bangkok, the US has accepted the principle of a single independent fund to be administered at least in part by the UN. This is a long way from what developing countries want - firm pledges of large sums of money to allow poor countries to buy technologies to help them develop cleanly and to adapt to climate change. But because talks have been frozen on the issue for months, the movement in the US position is being seen as a positive step. Until now, America, backed by Britain, has proposed that any money paid should be channelled through existing organisations like the World Bank. In addition it has insisted that contributions by rich countries should be voluntary. This has been flatly rejected in the past by G77 countries (an umbrella group of 130 developing nations) who have long mistrusted the bank, saying it is institutionally biased against poor countries. They have said they want the UN to administer a separate fund which would be guided, controlled and managed by all countries. In addition they do not want promises of cash, but guaranteed, predictable flows of money. Under the new US proposal, countries would be allowed to choose how much they paid and to direct it to specific areas, such as forestry or technology. Rich countries would come together every few years for what have been called &quot;pledge parties&quot;, where they would indicate how much they intended to pay. In addition, they want businesses and other groups including NGOs to have access to the funds. The proposal will almost certainly be rejected by G77 countries and insiders do not expect it to form part of the final Copenhagen deal, but the US move is considered significant because it represents some movement in the negotiating positions. The talks have been deadlocked on finance for months. &quot;The positions are becoming clearer. The US has opened the door to a single fund. The worrying sign is that it assumes that the developing countries will take what they can get and will not walk out of the talks. That&apos;s a dangerous assumption,&quot; said Oxfam analyst Antonio Hill. &quot;We still have a deadlock on finance. The key to unlocking it is with the Annex 1 [rich] countries. At the moment no money has been put forward,&quot; said Raman Metha of Action Aid who suggested that the US proposal was a negotiating tactic to force the G77 to compromise. Countries have made no progress in Bangkok on how much money they are prepared to put up, or what proportion would be new rather than come from carbon markets or existing aid. Discussions are expected to go to the wire at Copenhagen in December. At present the leading contender is still Gordon Brown&apos;s suggestion of $100bn a year (\u00a361bn) which has been endorsed by the EU&apos;s environment minister Stavros Dimas.", "publicationDate": "2009-10-06T12:10:37Z", "tags": ["Copenhagen climate change conference 2009", "Climate change", "Environment", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Thailand", "World news", "Business", "Global climate talks", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/06/climate-change-funding", "title": "America makes first move to allow independent fund for poor countries", "sentences": ["Although US negotiators have not made any specific promises on finance at talks currently under way in Bangkok, the US has accepted the principle of a single independent fund to be administered at least in part by the UN.", "Countries have made no progress in Bangkok on how much money they are prepared to put up, or what proportion would be new rather than come from carbon markets or existing aid."]}, {"article": "Man-made greenhouse gas emissions will drop 3% in 2009 largely because of the worldwide financial crisis, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said today. Three-quarters of the reduction has been the result of less industrial activity, with the rest coming from countries turning to renewable energy and nuclear power. But the world&apos;s premier energy analysts calculated that to avoid dangerous climate change, countries around the world will have to spend $400bn a year building more than 350 new nuclear plants and 350,000 wind turbines in the next 20 years. They also estimate that by 2020, three-fifths of cars will need to use alternatives to the traditional internal combustion engine. The findings came in a special extract of the IEA&apos;s forthcoming annual world energy outlook report, published at the UN climate talks in Bangkok. The emissions cuts, only the fourth in the last 50 years, provide countries with a unique chance to switch to less carbon-intensive energy sources, said the IEA&apos;s chief economist, Fatih Birol. &quot;Average growth in emissions has been 3% a year but we estimate this year that emissions will fall 3%. Because of the financial crisis, many industries have the chance to move away from unsustainable power. If we get a good result at the Copenhagen climate talks, then they could be turned to sustainable energy,&quot; he said. The independent agency, which is funded by the world&apos;s richest 28 countries, said it would be a catastrophe if countries continued with business as usual. &quot;We need an energy and environment revolution. Business as usual would increase temperatures by 6C. To hold emissions to 450ppm [parts per million], we need in the region of 18 nuclear power stations, 17,000 turbines, 100 concentrated solar power stations and 16 carbon capture and storage plants to be built every year until 2030,&quot; said Birol. &quot;We think the share of renewables and nuclear which is now 18% worldwide needs to go up to 33% by 2030,&quot; he said. &quot;But energy efficiency will be the key.&quot; The energy revolution envisaged by the IEA would cost about $400bn a year to fund between now and 2020, but it would cost far more to catch up with emission cuts later on, said Nobuo Tanaka, the director of the agency. &quot;The benefits will be that we avoid the worst implications of climate change which are unquantifiable. Everyone will also save money,&quot; he said. Under the IEA&apos;s scenario of how the world could hold emissions to 450ppm, countries would have rapidly away from the internal combustion engine. &quot;Ninety-five per cent of new cars today have internal combustion engines. To hold emissions to 450 [ppm] you need more and more hybrids and electric cars. By 2020, only 40% of cars should have internal combustion engines,&quot; it suggested. For the first time, the agency estimated the costs to Opec oil-producing countries of a worldwide shift away from petrol and oil. With no deal at Copenhagen, it says, the industry could expect to earn about $28tr between 2012 and 2030. But holding emissions to 450ppm would reduce the industry&apos;s revenue by 16% to $24tr, said Birol. &quot;They would earn less, but it would still be four times more than they have earned in the last 22 years, he said. &quot;Oil, coal and gas needs to peak at 2020 and then decline. Renewables, nuclear and CCS [carbon capture and storage] need to go up dramatically,&quot; said the report. He said that the climate talks due to conclude in Copenhagen in December were fundamental to whether the world moved away from fossil fuels. &quot;That requires signals. People do not invest in dirty power because they are bad but because of the money. Without an incentive signal from Copenhagen it will not change,&quot; he said. &quot;The IEA&apos;s report confirms what we already know \u2013 that every year&apos;s delay in climate action will significantly increase the costs,&quot; said Kaisa Kosonen, Greenpeace International policy analyst. The assessment confirms that current industrialised country targets are not enough to drive energy efficiency and renewables on the scale needed. It also confirms what Greenpeace&apos;s own scenario shows, that energy efficiency will play by far the biggest role in solving climate change - over and above any other technologies. The rise and fall of carbon emissions  Carbon emissions are strongly linked to economic growth and have increased globally roughly 3% a year since the 1950s. But they have also fallen three times in the last 60 years. The first drop occurred during the oil crises of the early 1970s when the price of oil more than doubled, forcing many industries to contract or close.  Emissions fell again in the early 1990s with the economic collapse of the Soviet Union which depended heavily on coal. Industrial output plummeted, coal mines closed and people could not afford to heat their homes. More surprisingly, carbon emissions also fell 0.3% in 1998-99, thanks partly to improved energy efficiency but mainly because Britain and Germany closed many coal mines and switched to gas, and China reduced its energy subsidies. The world economy continued to grow, mainly though information technologies and service sectors that were not then major energy users.  The 2009 fall in emissions due to the credit crunch and the recession that has followed it is the deepest since the 1970s.", "publicationDate": "2009-10-06T12:52:29Z", "tags": ["Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Copenhagen climate change conference 2009", "Energy", "Renewable energy", "Nuclear power", "Climate change", "Science", "Global recession", "Global economy", "Business", "World news", "Environment", "Global climate talks"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/06/carbon-cuts-recession-iea", "title": "Carbon emissions will fall 3% due to recession, say world energy analysts", "sentences": ["The findings came in a special extract of the IEA&apos;s forthcoming annual world energy outlook report, published at the UN climate talks in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "They say that a good sequel answers the questions that its predecessor left open. So with that in mind, next month&apos;s Ong-Bak: The Beginning can&apos;t come quickly enough. After all, one of the most infuriating things about the 2003 original was that it didn&apos;t answer the question of what Ong-Bak would be like if it was set several hundred years ago, bore absolutely no resemblance to the first movie whatsoever and included a scene of a man punching out a crocodile. Thanks for fixing that, Ong-Bak: The Beginning! You&apos;re the greatest! You might remember the original Ong-Bak. It was a little bit like Bangkok Dangerous, except instead of starring Nicolas Cage it was actually quite good. Its plot involved martial artist Tony Jaa running around modern-day Thailand looking for a statue&apos;s head and beating up all kinds of drug-dealing ne&apos;er-do-wells in the process, sometimes while his legs were on fire. But now Ong-Bak is, well, back. Wikipedia describes Ong-Bak: The Beginning \u2013 which was released in Jaa&apos;s native Thailand last year \u2013 as &quot;a historical epic with elements of fantasy [that] has nothing to do with Ong-Bak&quot;. So, for reasons never really explained, it&apos;s set in an ancient world that never really existed. It&apos;d be a bit like the producers of Sex and the City 2 turning it into a Viking movie just to see what Samantha would look like if she tried to have it off with a horny Norseman. Also, it&apos;s worth mentioning that Ong-Bak: The Beginning is different from the Ong-Bak 2 that was released in 2005, because that wasn&apos;t really an Ong-Bak film. No, instead of Ong-Bak 2, you should call that film The Protector, because if that was really Ong-Bak 2 then Ong-Bak: The Beginning would be Ong-Bak 3 \u2013 but it can&apos;t be Ong-Bak 3 because Tony Jaa&apos;s already making an Ong-Bak 3 and it&apos;s coming out in December. Clear? Good. So we&apos;ve established that Ong-Bak: The Beginning shares absolutely nothing in common with the first movie, not even the millennium it was set in. But that complete absence of formal logic doesn&apos;t matter. Like the original, it&apos;s all just a big excuse to show an angry man kicking people over in slow motion. That&apos;s what Ong-Bak is famous for, isn&apos;t it? Back in 2003 its tagline was, &quot;No stunt doubles, no computer images, no strings attached.&quot; Everything you saw was completely real. Except, if the ridiculous lack of respect for animal safety demonstrated in Ong-Bak: The Beginning&apos;s trailer is anything to go by, it&apos;d be nice if there were at least some computer images or strings attached along the way.             Because when I saw Tony Jaa cracking a man&apos;s motorcycle helmet open with his burning knees in the original, it elicited a kind of awe-struck wonder for his brave defiance of physics. But seeing him charge at an elephant and using its tusk and forehead as a launchpad for a gratuitous back flip in the new film just makes me feel a bit sorry for the elephant. So does Ong-Bak: The Beginning qualify as the most berserk sequel of all time? It would be easy to say yes, but perhaps we should wait for Ong-Bak 3 to be released first. If the pattern holds, one gets the impression that it&apos;ll be set in a parallel universe, a billion years in the future, and at some point Tony Jaa will fend off an army of enemies by kicking hundreds of baby koala bears at them.

In traditional Chinese medicine, rhino horn is prized as a key ingredient in An Gong Niu Huang Wan, considered one of the three main restorative tonics. Shaved or ground into a powder, the horn is dissolved in boiling water and used to treat fevers, rheumatism and gout. The Chinese government banned the trade in rhino horn in 1993 at the same time as it imposed a similar prohibition on the sale of tiger body parts. Since the ban, the horn of water buffalo has been used as a substitute, but it is not considered as effective. On the internet, sales continue of rhino-based An Gong Niu Huang Wan with claims that the product is made with horn stockpiled before the ban. Chinese and Vietnamese buyers prefer horn from Asian rhinos, which is three to six times more expensive than that of African animals. But poaching and habitat loss mean there are few rhinos left in Asia, which is what could have prompted the dealers to look for supplies in Africa. Last May, an official of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species visited south-east Asia to appeal to enforcement authorities to pay extra vigilance to rhino horn smuggling. &quot;The Vietnamese are moving rhino horn from Africa. That&apos;s something we haven&apos;t seen before,&quot; noted an Asia-based conservationist, who asked to remain anonymous. &quot;There is stockpiling. Collectors appear to be holding on to the horn like gold and waiting for the value to increase.&quot; Assessment of the extent of the problem is complicated by the tendency of smugglers to mix rhino horn with elephant tusks.

The autobiography has passages describing the narrator&apos;s shame and attraction for gay prostitution bars in Asia, and the pleasure and emptiness of paying for sex. When published it was hailed for its honesty. Asked at the time about his use of the term &quot;young boys&quot;, Mitterrand said he called all men &quot;boys&quot; and it did not refer to minors. Sarkozy, when he appointed Mitterrand this summer, described the book as &quot;brave and talented&quot;. Asked if paying for sex in Thailand was a mistake, Mitterrand said: &quot;An error, without a doubt. A crime, no.&quot; He said he had Sarkozy&apos;s full support and would not resign; politicians attacking him were confusing homosexuality and paedophilia.

A very great deal in the surreal climate change talks here in Bangkok, where the final order of these three letters in the forestry text could make the difference between the global logging industry being subsidised by governments to continue clear-felling Africa and Indonesia, and communities being left to live in strongly protected forests. SFM is the villain \u2013 a meaningless greenwash phrase adopted widely by the global logging industry to allow it to carry on business as usual. SMF, however, emphasises conservation and protection and is backed by the likes of Greenpeace and Global Witness, as well as many countries. The problem is that the phrase SFM keeps popping up in the draft texts, courtesy of the EU, and very few diplomats have a clue which one means what. Ed gets the gauntlet The politicians are not here, but the G77 group of 130 developing countries is keen to send a message to the UK energy and climate change secretary, Ed Miliband. Ambassador Di-Aping Lumumba of Sudan, chair of the group, is clearly amused by Ed&apos;s statement in the Guardian earlier this week that the talks are &quot;too important to be left to the formal negotiators&quot;. Lumumba said: &quot;Britain are not the bad guys here. I would say the current British government just lacks the resolve. The challenge now starts with Ed Miliband. Either you are the one to direct here, or you are a general whose troops do not address your will.&quot; Quite a few people in the Foreign Office and even the cabinet probably know Lumumba, because he used to work for McKinsey and has an Oxford doctorate. But that doesn&apos;t stop him pointing the finger at the west: &quot;Developed countries are driven here by national interests and are being pulled by very small lobby groups, and the result is no progress and a race to the bottom.&quot; At last, some ambition At least Norway is showing real leadership. Yesterday it came up with proposals to increase its emission cuts to 30-40% \u2013 the most ambitious target of all developed countries and what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says is needed if we are to avoid more than a 2C rise in temperature. The talks have, so far, failed to extract any other pledges from rich countries. That leaves Annex 1 (industrialised) countries promising just 13-21% cuts, if you exclude the tentative US proposal, and a meagre 11-18% with it. A very diplomatic row There&apos;s restrained diplomatic fury in the halls here over rich countries&apos; moves to bail out of the existing Kyoto protocol in favour of a brand-new, weaker agreement that the US \u2013 and countries including Canada and Russia \u2013 would prefer. NGOs of all hues are piling in behind the G77 countries to try to save the Kyoto protocol. Oxfam accused rich countries of not just trying to change the rules of the game, but trying to change the game itself. &quot;Fifteen years ago, rich countries agreed they would take the lead. In 2007 in Bali, they reaffirmed their commitments would be greater than developing countries. But here they are trying to force the G77 and China to take actions that would be unfair considering the gaping hole in rich country commitments,&quot; stormed Antonio Hill, Oxfam&apos;s senior climate adviser. The WWF piled in with a cunning plan to keep Kyoto alive with a second parallel treaty that would cover future US and developing country emissions. Which is fine, except for the fact that the poorest countries might not all agree to being in the same room as the US. No country is an island Britain has gone out of its way in its climate change preparations to help the weakest countries, even going as far as setting up a separate political grouping of 20 &quot;most vulnerable&quot; nations, mostly small Caribbean and Pacific island states that stand to go under with any sea level rises. But is there low political intent behind this? The word in the Bangkok bars is that this is a sophisticated way to split the quarrelsome but so far united G77 countries at the end of the talks when the politicians fly in, the horse-trading starts and the promises of aid and development cash are made. Countries such as India and South Africa are angry at not being included as vulnerable (&quot;Do we not bleed too?&quot; asked one diplomat). Maldives meeting Can Miliband swim? The question arises because there is idle, unconfirmed chatter in Bangkok that Britain intends to convene a November meeting in the Maldives of all the heads of states of the vulnerable countries to prepare their positions \u2013 and perhaps their cheques \u2013 before Copenhagen.

The only bright spot in the negotiations was Norway&apos;s decision to increase its emissions reduction target to 40% on 1990 levels by 2020, he said. &quot;The EU has only increased developing country mistrust and the US is trying to impose its own domestic limitations on the world.

We were staying with my S\u00e1mi friend, Lennart and his family. While we lounged in the l\u00e1vvu \u2013 a Lapp tent-house made from peat and pelt \u2013 Lennart cooked up a m\u00e1les, the S\u00e1mi meal prepared at slaughter time, which consists of almost every part of a reindeer boiled in the same pot: liver, tongue, bone and steak with its hump of canary-yellow fat. &quot;Even the hooves are boiled!&quot; Lennart announced, handing me a green birch skewer with which to poke marrow from bone. I could see the flickering ion-stream of the northern lights through the roof opening. Lennart&apos;s wife offered a chunk of cooked reindeer fat on a\u00a0plate. &quot;For the baby,&quot; she said. &quot;He&apos;s not weaned yet,&quot; I said. &quot;I know,&quot; she said. &quot;That&apos;s what we wean them with.&quot; I was in the Arctic researching my new book, The Magnetic North, the story of a sequence of east-to-west journeys around high polar latitudes. I have been a travel writer for almost my entire career and in the dozen years since I&apos;ve had my children, I have\u00a0adapted our family life to the vagaries and requirements of my schedule. It hasn&apos;t always involved boiled hoof. But it hasn&apos;t been a picnic,\u00a0either. Unsurprisingly, the history of travel\u00a0writing reveals few mothers. Have a baby, and you lose your passport to that mysterious and magical world of anonymity, impulse and sleazy bars. The famous fathers of the genre usually had that most valuable travel accessory: a wife who stayed at home minding the squalling brood. (Forget the multi-outlet electrical adaptor. Get a wife!). The Great Railway Bazaar: And\u00a0the Kids Came Too. I don&apos;t think so. For my own part, I still desperately miss those halcyon days when I shampooed my hair in washing-up liquid, slept on the roofs of moving trains and came home when I felt like it. Home, in fact, was wherever I stashed my carpetbag. My partner, Peter, also works for himself, though not as a writer, and we had never really planned how things might work out when or if infants arrived. When I was first pregnant in 1997, I sold a series to a Sunday newspaper called Travels with My Baby. It was a panic reaction. We needed my income, and I couldn&apos;t think of any other way in which I could continue working. So when the baby, Wilf, sprang forth, he and I spent our first year flogging round the globe. One of my first assignments was on the QE2, sailing from Sydney to Manila. Hardly slumming it, I admit, but it was exhausting. I wish, in retrospect, I had stayed in Starbucks with the other women from my antenatal group. I feel I missed out on something. It was a rubbish series, too. After about 10 months, I began to relax, and to get the hang of my new status as a double-act. Improvisation was the key to keeping the show on the road. Once, in a town in the American heartlands that might have been called Coma, I asked the motel owner if he could possibly provide a crib (cot), as I had forgotten to book one in advance. They didn&apos;t have such a thing, but the man kindly said he would see what he could do. An hour later, there was a knock on our door and he wheeled in a shopping\u00a0trolley. When our second son, Reg, was born five years after his brother, the New York Times asked me to go to Bangkok at short notice. I was barely sleeping (of course) and permanently knackered. But they bribed me with a business-class ticket, Peter and Wilf enjoyed a boys&apos; week at home in London, and Reg and I preened ourselves at the Mandarin Oriental. During the day we whizzed around town on a tuk-tuk, while in the evenings I hired a babysitter from among the fabulous Mandarin staff while I went out to conduct cutting-edge late-night reportage. It worked out all right, though I never did get round to sleeping, as I was up the other half of the night breastfeeding. (At least Thai well-wishers didn&apos;t advise me to shove tin foil down my shirt as my S\u00e1mi friends had. They said it reflected the heat back. In fact, I found that lactation was the only bodily function unimpaired by temperatures of -30C.) As for the other two back in England, they had a high old time. It was the first of many family experiences in which we split into pairs. It seems to suit us. One year we even spent Christmas apart \u2013 Wilf and I hiking in South America while Reg and Peter manfully tackled the family turkey without us back in London. Toddling was in many ways the most\u00a0difficult period, for obvious reasons. It was much harder than babydom, anyway. But as the children grew more robust, I chose projects I could incorporate into family life. My\u00a0last book was about a man who lived in East Africa, and we often decamped en famille for research trips: Peter and our sons rather took to safari life. (The children liked in particular the fact that you don&apos;t get to wash very often.) Besides that, I picked assignments that suited us all. In Morocco we rode camels, and the New York Times picture editor commissioned the man who does the Babar illustrations (the son of the author, who set the series in north Africa) to paint a picture of Daddy Babar, Mummy Babar and Little Babars on camels for the cover of the magazine. I bought the original, and Wilf still has it framed on his bedroom wall. It cost more than the fee I received for the piece, but it looks cool. I have a residual conviction that I am\u00a0a worse mother than everyone else on the planet because I don&apos;t bake cakes or build Lego replicas of the Taj Mahal, and no doubt for other reasons too. But there has never seemed a choice other than battling on. And, at heart, I try to make it into an experience that my children will always remember. Many years ago I wrote a book on Chile and when the publishers asked me to return to write an introductory essay to a second edition, I decided to take Wilf, then nine. We cycled in the Atacama desert, kayaked in the Pacific and rode horses for three days up an old trading route into the Andes. There was to be none of the drink-sodden Santiago lowlife I recalled so fondly from my first trip. It was only when I struggled on to my horse at the beginning of the Andean trail that I remembered how much I hate riding. The route was precipitous and constructed entirely of large, loose stones, and I was terrified before, during and after every step. Wilf loved it. I began to find that the children were more adaptable than me. In addition, their ability to make friends wherever they fetch up has opened many doors, real and imaginary. In the streets of old Havana they played an endless succession of baseball matches with Cuban boys, often with a piece of wood for a bat, always effortlessly bridging the language barrier. It brought another world close, and added another dimension to my own journey. In a settlement in the Masai Mara, Wilf mesmerised adults and children alike with a bendy wooden toy snake that went from hand to hand amid uproarious laughter. When we left, he presented it to the head man. Tricky moments? Of course. In South Africa with a one-year-old Wilf, the rangers in one reserve informed me that his mewlings attracted game, as hungry big cats mistook the sound for a wounded impala fawn. We wanted to see big cats, but were less keen on providing dinner. Elsewhere on the continent, a domestic guard dog bit Reg. Just thinking about it still makes my stomach twist up. We are always inoculated to the max; I established that the hound had received its rabies shot and calls to a paediatrician friend at home took care of the rest. I am not a diligent mother when it comes to forcing the children to keep holiday journals. I was afraid it would turn them against the trips and, besides, I couldn&apos;t be bothered. But Wilf is a keen birder \u2013 I am sure as a result of his travels \u2013 and I have stimulated his hobby as much as I can\u00a0with books, ornithological lectures\u00a0and special outings to hides. He&apos;s a far better spotter than I am and is often commended in the bush for sighting a lesser-striped lullaballoo or cream-faced loon. His comments on flora and fauna in general regularly find their way into my work, usually disguised as my own observations so I get the credit. In sub-Saharan Africa I&apos;ve noticed that he gets more out of the walking safaris, which look at insects. And he&apos;s right: micro-ecology is more fascinating than lions. At any rate, the wildlife potential of our peregrinations goes some way to making up for not having a dog. I can just about keep it all going with children. But I can&apos;t do it with a labrador as well. It&apos;s much harder to schedule trips now that we are in the iron grip of school terms (two different schools, to make matters worse). But school makes it easier for me to sneak off alone, and I find that during term I can now leave them all without undue trauma. Peter can take up the slack, though we do still have a live-in nanny, who has been with us for five years. It&apos;s an occupational hazard of being a travel writer that\u00a0you never enjoy a proper holiday. You always have a notebook in your pocket and a narrative running in your head. To keep the gas man at bay, I turned us into a house-swapping family, guaranteeing\u00a0a plentiful supply\u00a0of stories that I could turn into income under the guise of adventurous family holidays. Working through a home-exchange website, we have decamped to Nova Scotia; to the Greek island of Lesbos; and to Agadir\u00a0in Morocco \u2013 all a success, the only downside being the need to tidy our own house in north London before\u00a0our\u00a0house-swapping partners arrived. For this article I asked Wilf, now 12, to nominate the highlight of his travelling life so far. He thought for a while. &quot;My first polar bear,&quot; he said. &quot;Definitely.&quot; I had taken him on a Russian icebreaker across the Arctic ocean in the course of my work on the magnetic north. Setting off from Murmansk, we headed north to the uninhabited Russian archipelago of Franz Josef Land before smashing west to the top of Svalbard and across to the remote east coast of Greenland, ending up in Reykjavik. The all-Russian crew adopted Wilf, the only child on board, and in the evenings took him into the staff sauna (a feature of all Russian ships) for a good thrashing with birch twigs. In short, I&apos;ve made the best of what seemed at the outset like a stiff challenge. I enjoy sharing the joys of the open road with my boys, and I enjoy, equally, stealing a bit of my old life back and venturing forth alone. I hope the children have absorbed some of the rewards of travel: the power of the fleeting moment; the glimpse of another world; the whiff of a souk, recalled when the walls close in.

There are long tables strewn with enchanting models of buildings, furniture and decorative patterns. There are maquettes of voluptuous chairs for Established &amp; Sons, the firm founded by Alasdhair Willis, husband of Stella McCartney; and there&apos;s a chandelier for Swarovski, the crystals firm. Until recently, this warehouse in Notting Hill, London, was the home of\u00a0Future Systems, the celebrated architecture and design studio. Today, some 40 or 50 young architects from all over the world work here, switching happily between screen-based design, sketches and handmade models. On the walls of this new practice, named AL_A, hang photographs of heroes, including the great Oscar Niemeyer. There are shelves of books and magazines, all pointing to a healthy interest in the very latest in design, from fabrics to facades, from structure to the skins of buildings. You should, however, expect no less. Although AL_A is just six months old, this practice is a scion of Future Systems, which Levete fronted from 1989 with Jan Kaplicky, her former professional partner and husband. Kaplicky died suddenly this year while out walking in Prague, the city he left for London at the time of the Soviet invasion in 1968. From 1979, Future Systems produced dozens of thrilling, space-age designs aiming to take the mock-Tudor British public to infinity and beyond. When Levete left the Richard Rogers Partnership to join Kaplicky, there followed a clutch of eye-catching, memorable buildings the like of which Britain had never seen before. Now a decade old, the Media Centre at Lord&apos;s cricket ground, looking like the bridge of a starship, is an exquisite, aluminium pod of a building, while the Selfridges designed for Birmingham&apos;s new-look Bull Ring, completed in 2003, is a curving bubble of shiny blue that seems to have been fished from a lagoon light years from Earth. So will AL_A follow the meteoric trajectory of Future Systems? &quot;Jan was a\u00a0wonderful designer,&quot; says Levete. &quot;I learned so much from him. I adored him, of course. But Jan liked to design an entire project in his own head, through his own eyes and hands. I&apos;m far more sociable, certainly more collaborative. In the last few years, when we worked together, well, we worked apart really. Jan did his projects. I did mine.&quot; Eventually, the stress of living and working together caused Levete and Kaplicky to separate in 2003 and divorce three years later. A little after that, they went their own ways professionally: Levete would start under a new name in\u00a0Notting Hill, while Kaplicky would return to Prague. Tragically, Kaplicky, happy to be back home, died the day his new wife gave birth to a daughter. In her Building magazine column, Levete wrote: &quot;I deeply regret I have to make my peace with Jan in death rather than life, particularly since we had both found personal happiness \u2013 and finally reached agreement about splitting the office.&quot; She wrote of Kaplicky&apos;s great legacy, both built and unbuilt, that would continue to inspire her. &quot;We&apos;re new,&quot; says Levete of AL_A, &quot;but we&apos;ve got a fantastic heritage from Future Systems, so it&apos;s hardly as if we&apos;re starting from scratch.&quot; There is certainly no lack of work. Despite the current slump, Levete is actively recruiting \u2013 but then AL_A are working on the massive, and hugely impressive, transformation of News Corporation&apos;s &quot;Fortress Wapping&quot;. Not far from the Tower of London, this will be the media HQ for eight Murdoch-owned companies with a\u00a0combined staff of around 4,500. A new media HQ for Murdoch  From what I am allowed to see of this project, up for final planning consent next month, it looks as if Levete and her team have delivered something very special. If it all goes to plan, the secretive Fortress Wapping will be opened up, with public streets and cafes, while those working for the Murdoch empire will find\u00a0themselves in offices linked by sensational atriums \u2013 all swooping stainless steel stairs, daylight, fresh air and movement. &quot;We want to capture the energy of the industrial printing process,&quot; says Levete. &quot;The great thing about the existing concrete framed structure is that we can remodel it to create something unexpected and new.&quot; AL_A has already completed three projects: a bridge in Dublin, the renovation of a Mayfair house and the extension and recladding of a warehouse and office just off London&apos;s Oxford Street that brings a little sparkle to this glum shopping mile. Levete is also working (with the artist Anish Kapoor) on a metro station in Naples, as well as on a tower in Bangkok that will rise in undulating folds from the gardens of the former British embassy, draped in a shimmering, body-hugging material formed of thousands of locally made ceramic tiles,\u00a0each put in place by hand. &quot;I&apos;ve never worked in Asia before,&quot; says Levete. &quot;In Bangkok, labour is cheap but technology is expensive, so we designed something that responds to the socio-economic conditions there.&quot; This skin, or sarong, of tiles is important to Levete, who likes &quot;visual complexity through repetition \u2013 find a motif and repeat it&quot;. What&apos;s exciting about AL_A is Levete&apos;s desire to marry craft, or hand skills, with the very latest in design, materials and structural engineering. She believes that, while computer modelling is a fine and fascinating thing, architecture should remain enjoyably tactile. &quot;Everyone loves models,&quot; she says, &quot;no matter what they&apos;re made of. Sometimes flat-screen computer presentations of\u00a0structure get so intricate that even the\u00a0architects who design them find them incomprehensible.&quot; For example? Levete introduces me to her US colleague Bruce Davison, who is working on an exquisite stainless steel bridge for the gardens of the Ch\u00e2teau la Coste winery near Aix-en-Provence. His computer drawings are intense affairs, but Levete has insisted that he make a paper model to better convey his ideas. It is a joyous thing of paper folded over and again. Not only is it beautiful, but its logic is immediately clear. Next year, this jewel-like bridge will become a reality, taking its place beneath trees that will dapple its treads with leafy light. Closer to home, Levete has entered a\u00a0competition to extend Manchester&apos;s Whitworth art gallery, famous for its collection of textiles and paintings. She sees the extension as an unobtrusive folding and unfolding structure, rippling out across Whitworth park like a roll of fabric. Levete&apos;s merging of landscape, jewellery and architecture is something of a new way forward in architecture \u2013 a tactile, sensuous and delightful approach in a world too concerned with shaping buildings by computer. With so many projects on the go, does Levete feel her new practice is more pragmatic than Future Systems? &quot;No. Pragmatic isn&apos;t the word I&apos;d use. More connected, perhaps, more fluid. Design is a way of thinking \u2013 and we hope to think even more than before.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-10-11T20:50:00Z", "tags": ["Architecture", "Culture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/oct/11/amanda-levete-ala-jan-kaplicky", "title": "Amanda Levete: to infinity and beyond", "sentences": ["Levete is also working (with the artist Anish Kapoor) on a metro station in Naples, as well as on a tower in Bangkok that will rise in undulating folds from the gardens of the former British embassy, draped in a shimmering, body-hugging material formed of thousands of locally made ceramic tiles,\u00a0each put in place by hand.", "&quot;In Bangkok, labour is cheap but technology is expensive, so we designed something that responds to the socio-economic conditions there.&quot; This skin, or sarong, of tiles is important to Levete, who likes &quot;visual complexity through repetition \u2013 find a motif and repeat it&quot;."]}, {"article": "Billionaire financier and philanthropist George Soros has pledged to invest more than $1bn (\u00a3625m) of his own money in clean energy technology to tackle climate change. Speaking in Copenhagen on Saturday evening, the Hungarian-born Soros also announced the foundation of the Climate Policy Initiative, which he will fund with $10m annually for the next decade. Soros, ranked the world&apos;s 29th wealthiest individual by Forbes magazine, said: &quot;There is no magic bullet for climate change, but there is a lethal bullet: coal.&quot; Soros, who already holds limited investments in clean coal technology ventures, explained he would apply &quot;stringent conditions&quot; to the disbursement of the $1bn. &quot;I will look for profitable opportunities, but I will also insist that the investments make a real contribution to solving the problem of climate change.&quot; The Climate Policy Initiative, formally launched in Berlin next month, would focus on the efficacy and implementation of policy, said Soros, &quot;to protect the public interest against special interests&quot;. The new global climate watchdog will be based in San Francisco and headed by Stanford professor Thomas Heller.

Soros said: &quot;Global warming is a political problem. The science is clear; what is less clear is whether world leaders will demonstrate the political will necessary to solve the problem.&quot; Soros revealed that he had been converted to the cause of tackling climate change by former US vice-president Al Gore. While he lacked any scientific expertise, he said, &quot;the one thing I have is the ability to put money to work&quot;. Soros&apos;s intervention came as pressure mounted on national leaders to attend the Copenhagen talks in person. The former UN secretary general Kofi Annan, Danish prime minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and Nicholas Stern, author of a review into the economics of climate change, all urged heads of government to attend. &quot;This is about the future of government-level commitment,&quot; Stern said. &quot;It is very important that the heads of government are there.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-10-11T23:06:24Z", "tags": ["Climate change", "Energy efficiency", "Energy", "UK news", "Environment", "World news", "George Soros", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Philanthropy", "Society"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/12/george-soros-clean-energy-pledge", "title": "George Soros pledges $1bn to search for clean energy", "sentences": ["Soros&apos;s speech at the Project Syndicate editors&apos; forum came a day after climate talks in Bangkok ended in deadlock and 57 days before world leaders gather in the Danish capital to thrash out a new climate agreement."]}, {"article": "The Greenpeace activists occupying the roof of the Houses of Parliament are calling for a &quot;new style of politics in Britain, one capable of rising to meet the challenge of climate change&quot;. But instead should they be calling for electoral reform to save the climate? Greenpeace has put up banners saying &quot;change the politics, save the climate&quot;. But it is the scandal around expenses that will be uppermost in MPs minds on their first day back, not the climate. However, the fallout from the row could yet produce a future intake of politicians who put the needs of the planet above loyalty to party. If the scores of candidates who are likely to replace departing MPs are selected not by their constituency party or party lists but by open primaries, then it could be a real opportunity for those who care about the climate to put up candidates. There are already encouraging signs that this may happen. In August the Tories announced the winner of the first ever open postal vote of an entire constituency in Totnes. The result was not a career politician or one of the usual suspects but a doctor, Sarah Wollaston. Many big hitters in the Labour party have recently shown their support for open primaries. They include Ken Livingstone, who has backed them to elect the next mayor of London and the Tottenham MP David Lammy, who has called for them in every London borough. The foreign secretary, David Miliband, has also backed the cause, arguing the case in cabinet as part of the answer to the cynicism surrounding politics and falling party membership. For open primaries to really engage with the electorate, political parties must not just use them as a way of deflecting public anger but instead ensure they are rooted in the community and open to anyone and everyone. This comes at a cost. It is estimated that the open primary in Totnes cost the Tories about \u00a340,000 to organise. But in the greater scheme of things this seems a small price to pay to regain the public&apos;s trust and participation in politics. Building the cost of open primaries into future discussions about the state funding of political parties and election campaigns could be an option. If open primaries were used to replace departing MPs then there is no reason why environmental activists like those on the roof of the House of Commons wouldn&apos;t be elected to parliament, as well as people from many different walks of life. In return, Greenpeace and other environmental organisations should encourage their members to participate in the democratic process rather than shout from the rooftops. As a former campaigner with Greenpeace I&apos;ve participated in many actions and understand only too well its antipathy towards politics and politicians. But with more than five million members, green groups could be one of the major beneficiaries of such electoral reform. While many of them are constrained by rules governing charities, their members vote and many may be prepared to back candidates who put the climate at the centre of their campaign. For example the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has more than a million members and the National Trust has more than three and a half million members. In the case of the trust this is the equivalent to the population of Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow and Sheffield combined. And it has already declared that it wants to become &quot;the largest green movement in the world&quot; and put its members in the front line against climate change. Applying this electoral muscle in open primaries could well help to swing the vote, particularly in constituencies where climate change is a big issue, such as those with nuclear or coal-fired power stations. The Greenpeace action is timely, coming just two months before Copenhagen and as the climate talks in Bangkok having broken down in acrimony. The Committee on Climate Change has also published a report saying a &quot;step change&quot; in emissions cuts is needed. Sadly, I suspect the only questions that will be asked in the House about the protest will be regarding Westminster security. Yet if parliament advocated genuinely open primaries and they were embraced by the environmental movement, the banners in future could read &quot;join in politics, save the climate&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2009-10-12T13:00:00Z", "tags": ["Electoral reform", "Green politics", "Climate change", "Greenpeace", "MPs' expenses", "Politics", "Environment"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/oct/12/electoral-reform-climate-green-mps", "title": "Electoral reform could save the climate | Nicholas Milton", "sentences": ["The Greenpeace action is timely, coming just two months before Copenhagen and as the climate talks in Bangkok having broken down in acrimony."]}, {"article": "With last week&apos;s UN climate talks in Bangkok ending in recrimination and less than two months until the concluding negotiations in Copenhagen, pressure from environmental politicians and campaigners has never been so crucial.

The US hopes the new commitments will breathe life into the moribund negotiations to seal a global treaty on climate change in Copenhagen in December, by setting out what action each country will take. But many observers say such bilateral deals also risk seriously weakening any Copenhagen agreement by allowing the idea of a global limit on greenhouse gas emissions to be abandoned. The US&apos;s twin diplomatic push will see Barack Obama meeting China&apos;s president Hu Jintao in Beijing on November 16-17 before playing host to India&apos;s prime minister Manmohan Singh at the White House on November 24. The visits appear timed to provide a much-needed boost to a proposed law to reduce US emissions now before the Senate, as well as to the Copenhagen talks. At preparatory UN talks in Bangkok earlier this month, the US and other rich countries were accused by a group of 131 nations of trying to &quot;fundamentally sabotage&quot; the Kyoto protocol, which the group said must be the basis for its successor. Kyoto \u2014 which made no demands on developing countries and which the US refused to ratify \u2014 remains political kryptonite in Washington. The US wants to move away from a legally binding global agreement to one where individual countries pledge cuts in their national emissions. The state department envoy, Todd Stern, believes strongly that separate bilateral agreements with countries such as China, India, Russia and Brazil are the building blocks to an agreement at Copenhagen. But adoption of national action plans is hazardous say others, as there would be little clear idea of whether together they would avoid dangerous global warming. US officials are hopeful that breakthroughs with India and China could still provide the underpinnings for at least a limited deal at Copenhagen. &quot;China and India are both critically important to achieving our international goals on carbon reduction. We need them as part the system,&quot; said Senator Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat who serves on the foreign and environment and public works committees. &quot;There has already been a lot of work done between US and China, and there is going to be more work done next month with President Obama going to China.&quot; Indian officials are looking to their prime minister&apos;s visit to Washington to replicate an energy agreement signed between the US and China in July. India wants help in speeding its adoption of new, greener technologies and expanding its use of solar power.There is also interest in research co-operation, especially on carbon capture technologies, which hopes to trap greenhouse gases from power plants and bury them. &quot;It would be like the memorandum of understanding with China,&quot; said Jairam Ramesh, India&apos;s environment minister. In response, on India is preparing to unveil new measures to reduce its surging growth of greenhouse gas emissions: its own version of a carbon cap-and-trade scheme, in which polluters can buy and sell emissions permits, and a new solar project. &quot;We are going to introduce a domestic cap-and-trade programme, but the cap will be on energy intensity, not carbon,&quot; said Ramesh. This would limit how much carbon can be emitted for each unit of energy produced, which will slow the rise of emissions rather than cutting them back, and allow the Indian economy to continue to grow and alleviate poverty. He said the legislation to establish the scheme would be introduced before Singh&apos;s visit to Washington, with a vote in the Indian parliament by the end of the year: &quot;By December it will be done.&quot; India is also pushing for a relaxation of international patents on green technology. &quot;Unless you adjust the intellectual property rights, how do you bring about rapid defusion,&quot; said Shyam Saran, India&apos;s climate change envoy. US officials say they are looking to Obama&apos;s visit to Beijing to produce concrete commitments from China on how it would reduce its large and rapidly rising emissions. President Hu announced at a UN summit last month that China would reduce energy intensity by &quot;notable margins&quot;. &quot;Fairly intensive work is under way to thrash out specific content in the eight or nine different topic areas&quot; spelled out in July&apos;s memorandum, said David Doniger, a former US climate negotiator now at the Natural Resources Defence Council. Those areas are thought to include energy efficiency, &quot;clean coal&quot; technologies and electric cars. There has also been talk of extracting an agreement from China for efficiency in different sectors. &quot;If the US and China can come to some sort of view on this then I think it will unlock a lot of things,&quot; said Bj\u00f6rn Stigson, president of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. &quot;If that is not the case than i think we will not see a very comprehensive agreement in Copenhagen.&quot; The council represents 200 global companies with a combined value of $7 trillion, including household names such as Shell, Toyota, DuPont, adidas and PricewaterhouseCoopers. However, the diplomatic effort is tempered by growing pessimism within China at the prospects for an international climate deal. &quot;The Bangkok talks marked a new low. If we don&apos;t see progress soon, then Copenhagen is going to be an exercise in managing expectations,&quot; observed a European diplomat. Nonetheless, as well as unlocking the Copenhagen negotiations, new moves from India and China would help Obama at home, where his Democratic allies in the Senate face a tough struggle trying to pass a climate change bill to cut US emissions. After a number of delays and mixed signals from the White House, Democratic leaders in the Senate will begin an intense push on October 27 to craft a final bill. But that leaves barely three full working weeks before Copenhagen to try to put that bill to a vote. Environmentalists say movement from India and China could still help by quashing the argument from the right that other countries are not doing enough to cut greenhouse gas emissions. &quot;It is pretty clear to everyone in the US that bilateral agreements with India and China that are new and additional will help secure climate legislation in the US,&quot; said John Coequyt, who heads the climate programme at the Sierra Club. &quot;The big advantage of doing it in [bilateral] form is that it makes sense to members of Congress.&quot; India&apos;s move towards cap-and-trade is the latest in a series of shifts in Delhi&apos;s position on climate change. The moves are in part intended to dispel the risk that India is cast as the spoiler in the negotiations. &quot;We are not going to be a deal-breaker at Copenhagen,&quot; said Ramesh. India is also anxious to separate itself from China in the negotiations. China has now overtaken America as the world&apos;s largest single polluter, producing 23% of global greenhouse gas emissions. India is producing an increasing share of the world&apos;s emissions, but it presently is responsible for just 5%. Battle on the hill After the denialist Bush era, Obama promised a radically different approach to global warming \u2013 at home and abroad. But the White House and its Democratic allies in Congress still face a tough battle to pass a law to cut emissions. Such a law is critical to persuading the world that the US is serious about acting on climate change. The White House \u2013 which has been focused on trying to get a healthcare bill through Congress \u2013 persuaded Democrats to hold off on opening up debate in the Senate on climate change. The first draft \u2013 an 821-page work that calls for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% over 2005 levels by 2020 \u2013 has been on hold for two weeks. Now the date for a showdown has been fixed for 27 October. With Republicans predicting disastrous economic consequences from carbon taxes, and rustbelt Democrats fearing job losses in dirty industries, most commentators say there is only a slim chance of producing legislation before Copenhagen. China \u2013 A make or break partnership A deal between the US and China on climate change could make or break the negotiations at Copenhagen, business leaders say. The last round of negotiations in Thailand exposed the bitter divide between the industrialised and developing worlds over responsibility for causing global warming and compensation for the poor countries, which will be hit the hardest. &quot;If the US and China can come to some sort of view on this, then I think it will unlock a lot of things,&quot; said Bj\u00f6rn Stigson, president of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. &quot;If that is not the case than I think we will not see a very comprehensive agreement in Copenhagen.&quot; The council represents some 200 global companies with a combined value of $7tn, including household names such as Shell, Toyota, DuPont, and Adidas. Other executives said the US and China could come to a larger accord through joint ventures in technology development \u2013 especially carbon capture and storage. &quot;I have come to believe that there needs to be a ladder of co-operation between US corporations and Chinese corporations, US cities and Chinese cities,&quot; said Jim Rogers, the CEO of Duke Energy.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-10-14T17:40:14Z", "tags": ["Copenhagen climate change conference 2009", "World news", "Republicans", "Climate change", "UK news", "Obama administration", "Democrats", "Politics", "Environment", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Carbon capture and storage (CCS)", "Carbon offsetting", "US news", "China", "India", "Emissions trading", "Global climate talks", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/14/obama-india-china-climate-change", "title": "US bids for bilateral climate change deals with China and India", "sentences": ["At preparatory UN talks in Bangkok earlier this month, the US and other rich countries were accused by a group of 131 nations of trying to &quot;fundamentally sabotage&quot; the Kyoto protocol, which the group said must be the basis for its successor.", "&quot;The Bangkok talks marked a new low."]}, {"article": "Fears for the health of Thailand&apos;s 81-year-old king triggered a second day of big losses on the country&apos;s stock exchange today amid uncertainty over the royal succession. King Bhumibol Adulyadej was admitted to hospital in Bangkok last month with pneumonia. The Royal Household Bureau has issued statements almost daily that his general condition is good, but a lack of detailed information has given weight to rumours that he was seriously ill. That uncertainty was reflected on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), which closed down 5.3%, after, at one point, falling 8.2% \u2013 the biggest one-day fall since the global financial crisis began in October last year. On Wednesday, the market fell just over 2%, and trading will be halted tomorrow if shares continue to fall. Bhumibol, the world&apos;s longest-serving monarch, has ruled Thailand for 63 years through 15 coups, 16 constitutions, and 27 changes of prime minister. He is revered as an almost divine figure who has single-handedly restored the glory of a once-moribund monarchy. Bhumibol&apos;s son, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, is not perceived to have the stature or moral authority of his father, who has risen above partisan politics to become a unifying figure for the country. The 25th statement from the Royal Household Bureau since the king was admitted to hospital on 19 September said his lung infection was clearing up, but he was not yet completely recovered. The committee of royal physicians had requested &quot;that His Majesty remain in hospital in order to improve his nutrition status and to provide continuous rehabilitation therapies&quot;. Portraits of Bhumibol hang prominently in almost every home, business and public place in Thailand, and wristbands reading &quot;long live the king&quot; are now hugely popular. Thai newspapers have been publishing a front-page article every day updating readers on the king&apos;s progress. The length of his stay in hospital \u2013 and the absence of photographs of his convalescence \u2013 have led to speculation that he is seriously ill. Some say the rumours originated in Hong Kong and Singapore. The stock exchange president, Patareeya Benjapolchai, called for calm. &quot;The market would like to warn investors to closely follow announcements from the relevant agencies. They should not panic about rumours.&quot; The finance minister, Korn Chatikavanij, asked investors not to trade on hearsay. The stock market was &quot;very sensitive&quot; and investors should consider all information logically before making decisions, he said. Adding to the anxiety has been the political crisis triggered in 2006 when the army ousted the prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, after he was accused of corruption. The struggle has been played out in streets of the capital, where Thaksin&apos;s supporters and opponents have staged a series of mass protests. Last year yellow-shirted anti-Thaksin activists occupied the prime minister&apos;s offices for three months and seized the capital&apos;s two airports for a week. On Saturday red-shirted Thaksin supporters are planning a new protest in Bangkok.Amid the turmoil, Thailand is preparing for its third attempt to host the Asean leaders&apos; summit, which was abandoned when protesters stormed the convention centre.

The act is already in effect in the southern coastal town of Hua Hin, where ASEAN leaders will meet next week.

There weren&apos;t many signs of progress at the last three big gatherings on climate change. Barack Obama disappointed at the United Nations by failing to press the Senate to move forward on climate change legislation, while Hu Jintao offered no specifics on how far China would go to reduce its future greenhouse gas emissions. At the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh, the industrialised economies fell short of expectations they would produce a package on climate finance. And climate talks in Bangkok this month ended in even deeper acrimony between the developing and developed economies. But beneath the radar, there have been a few positive steps. Norway, Indonesia, and \u2014 as of this week \u2014 Brazil have all come forward with new pledges on climate action. The country&apos;s environment minister, Carlos Minc, was quoted this week saying that Brazil would propose capping its greenhouse gas emissions at 2005 levels. Meanwhile, the president, Lula Da Silva, said in a radio discussion that Brazil would take more aggressive measures to save the Amazon forest, aiming for an 80% reduction in deforestation in 2020. &quot;We&apos;re in the process of preparing our proposal for Copenhagen. I foresee that by 2020 we will be able to reduce deforestation by 80%, in other words we will emit some 4.8 billion fewer tonnes of carbon dioxide,&quot; the president said. A formal announcement of Brazil&apos;s new climate position is expected early next week. It was the third country to come forward with a new proposal since late last month. Indonesia&apos;s president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, told G20 leaders on September 25 that his government was working on a plan to cut emissions by 26% in 2020 over business as usual projections. In a copy of the speech obtained by AFP, the Indonesian leader said his country could cut emissions by as much as 41% \u2014 provided it got international support. He said the cuts would be achieved through increased investment in renewable energy, and curbing emissions from deforestation and other changes in land use. Norway also stepped up, using the Bangkok talks to come forward with proposals to cut emissions by 30% to 40%, the most ambitious target of all developed countries. Hilary McMahon, who works on climate policy at the World Resources Institute, says such individual pledges could become increasingly important. The international negotiations are moving towards a bottom-up approach, with individual countries setting their own targets. &quot;It really does help us to start doing the math and adding up how far this is going to get us,&quot; she said. &quot;Unfortunately we are still looking like we are quite short.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-10-16T10:15:44Z", "tags": ["Copenhagen climate change conference 2009", "Climate change", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Brazil", "Indonesia", "Norway", "Environment", "Global climate talks", "Europe", "Americas", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/oct/16/copenhagen-individual-deals", "title": "Copenhagen comes closer, but a deal seems further away | Suzanne Goldenberg", "sentences": ["And climate talks in Bangkok this month ended in even deeper acrimony between the developing and developed economies.", "Norway also stepped up, using the Bangkok talks to come forward with proposals to cut emissions by 30% to 40%, the most ambitious target of all developed countries."]}, {"article": "India&apos;s environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, did the rounds in Washington and New York last month, trying to persuade US officials, thinktanks and journalists that New Delhi was open to revising its longstanding climate policy. Ramesh even offered specifics on the changes India would be prepared to make. So it was a bit bewildering to see the Indian delegation revert to the traditional negotiating posture at the Bangkok climate change talks earlier this month. In a nutshell, this is that, since it was the developed world that caused the global warming problem, and since incomes and carbon emissions are a fraction of those in the west, India refuses to accept limits on its growth in order to make emissions cuts. India helped lead the attack by developing countries on an Australian proposal that would allow individual countries great latitude on how much to cut greenhouse gas emissions. And it was even more confusing to learn that Ramesh apparently approved that negotiating position. But now it seems the environment minister may be involved in his own delicate internal negotiations, trying to get the Indian bureaucracy to move away from a long-established position. The Times of India reports today on a leaked letter from Ramesh to India&apos;s prime minister, Manmohan Singh. In it, the environment minister warns that India could suffer an international backlash if it is seen to be obstructing a climate change deal at the UN talks in Copenhagen in December. He advises that India distance itself from the developing countries, and ingratiate itself with the G20 industrialised economies. &quot;We should be pragmatic and constructive, not argumentative and polemical,&quot; he says in the letter. &quot;India must listen more and speak less in negotiations.&quot; Ramesh declined to comment further to the Times of India, and he did not immediately respond to an email from the Guardian. But it does seem as if India, along with Indonesia, Brazil, and China, is floating new proposals about how much it may be ready to do on climate change \u2013 in the hope, presumably, of getting some kind of commitment in return from the US and other industrialised countries to help adoption of new green technology they will need in the future. How far India is really prepared to go will probably be a slow-reveal between now and Copenhagen, with Singh&apos;s state visit to Washington on 24 November a key moment to watch.", "publicationDate": "2009-10-19T18:06:14Z", "tags": ["Environment", "Copenhagen climate change conference 2009", "Climate change", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "India", "World news", "Global climate talks"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2009/oct/19/india-climate-emissions-ramesh", "title": "India's delicate game of carbon trade-offs", "sentences": ["So it was a bit bewildering to see the Indian delegation revert to the traditional negotiating posture at the Bangkok climate change talks earlier this month."]}, {"article": "China and India have signed a pact to coordinate their approach to climate negotiations and some domestic policies. The world&apos;s two most populous nations signed a memorandum of understanding yesterday ahead of back-to-back summits between their leaders and US president Barack Obama next month. The two nations will also form a joint working group that will meet once a year to coordinate policies. And they will cooperate on renewable energy and research into the effects of climate change on Himalayan glaciers. But the timing of the announcement highlights the importance of maintaining at least a show of unity on the climate issue, despite heightened tensions between the two nations. China and India are among the leaders of the G77 bloc of developing nations, who have consistently argued that they should not be obliged to set internationally binding targets for reducing greenhouse gases because richer nations have a far greater historical responsibility for the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. But with China now the world&apos;s biggest emitter and India the fourth, one of the central goals of the Copenhagen summit is to find a formula that encourages these nations to make verifiable commitments to tackle climate change while leaving room for their economies to develop. The United States hopes to make progress towards a breakthrough when Obama meets China&apos;s president Hu Jintao in Beijing on November 16-17 and then plays host to India&apos;s prime minister Manmohan Singh at the White House on November 24. But many inside these Asian nations are wary of efforts to make emerging economies break ranks. Earlier this week, the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh was castigated by the local media and opposition parties for supposedly considering a softening of India&apos;s negotiating position. Ramesh has since clarified there is no change in Indian policy or its alliance with other developing nations. At the signing ceremony for the memorandum yesterday, he stressed: &quot;There is no difference between the Indian and Chinese negotiating positions and we are discussing further what the two countries should be doing for a successful outcome at Copenhagen.&quot; New Delhi has also sought reassurance from Beijing that China will not sign a bilateral deal with the US that runs contrary to G77 goals. At the signing ceremony, Xie Zhenhua, China&apos;s vice-chairman of National Development and Reform Commission and the country&apos;s top climate change negotiator, tried to soothe such concerns: &quot;We regard India as a sincere, devoted friend and the MoU [memorandum of understanding] on climate change will take our cooperation on the issue to a new high.&quot; Indian and Chinese climate campaigners welcomed the show of solidarity. &quot;This is a good sign that developing nations are sticking together despite pressure from developed nations,&quot; said Siddharth Pathak, climate and energy campaigner of Greenpeace India. &quot;They will not allow themselves to bullied by other countries.&quot; Shirish Sinha, the head of the climate change programme at WWF India said the two nations faced common challenges in ensuring energy security and reducing poverty that set them apart from wealthier economies. &quot;It is largely in the interests of both countries given the pressure coming on them to take action, to really come together,&quot; he said. Despite the apparent hardening of positions and the lack of time before Copenhagen, climate negotiators said they had not given up hope of a positive outcome.&quot; &quot;I think the Copenhagen talks will eventually come up with something. So many people have been working on it for such a long time, and the whole world is watching, there will be something,&quot; said Liu Bin a climate expert at Tsinghua University and Chinese negotiator. &quot;I am getting a little more hopeful,&quot; said Chung Rae-Kwon, the climate change ambassador for South Korea. &quot;I think we are getting progress in finding an agreement.&quot; South Korea has proposed a compromise under which developing nations would register domestic actions to slow the growth of emissions. Although these targets would not be internationally binding, they would be subject to outside verification. It is unclear, however, whether a suitable formula can be found in time to persuade India, China and the United States to sign up at Copenhagen. Preparatory talks last month in Bangkok ended in acrimonious squabbles. &quot;Time is running out,&quot; said Yang Fuqiang, the director of the climate change and energy programme of WWF China. &quot;It&apos;s possible that all we will get at Copenhagen is a political declaration and an agreement to extend the process.&quot; A key to any agreement is for the US Senate to ratify a climate bill before the country&apos;s negotiators go to Copenhagen. Former vice-president Al Gore, who is spearheading efforts to get a bill passed, told an audience in Beijing yesterday that he was confident of success, but he cautioned against over-expectation. He said any global pact reached in Copenhagen was bound to disappoint many people, but it would be a step forward that could be strengthened at a later date once the business community received a signal that they would have to change their ways. &quot;I choose to be optimistic,&quot; he said.", "publicationDate": "2009-10-22T15:33:19Z", "tags": ["Climate change", "China", "India", "Environment", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Copenhagen climate change conference 2009", "World news", "Global climate talks", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/22/china-india-climate-change-cooperation", "title": "China and India agree to cooperate on climate change policy", "sentences": ["Preparatory talks last month in Bangkok ended in acrimonious squabbles."]}, {"article": "The first email In late 1971 Ray Tomlinson, an engineer working on a time-sharing system called Tenex, combined two programs named Cpynet and SNDMSG in order to send the first ever network email. It had been possible to send email from one user to another on a single computer for nearly 10 years but Tomlinson was the first to use the primitive Arpanet to send text from one computer to another. While the same principles are used to send emails across the world today, the very first email (the contents of which Tomlinson says he has long forgotten) was sent between two computers sitting right next to each other. At the same time, Tomlinson also devised the format of modern emails, with the @ symbol dividing the user name from the name of the host computer (although he did not invent the symbol itsel). And why did he do it? &quot;Mostly because it seemed like a neat idea.&quot; The first virus Computer viruses and worms, essentially just self-replicating programs, were predicted as early as 1949 by the mathematician John von Neumann. It is generally accepted that the first was a virus called the Creeper, which infected Arpanet in 1971. It was created by an engineer called Bob Thomas working for BBN, the same company that employed email creator Ray Tomlinson. The Creeper was not, however, malicious. Infected machines would simply display the message, &quot;I&apos;m the creeper: catch me if you can,&quot; but did not suffer any lasting damage. The first piece of anti-virus software was created as a direct response to the Creeper&apos;s challenge. The Reaper was also a self-replicating program, which spread through the system in much the same way that the Creeper had, and removed the offending virus from infected computers. Just as quickly as it had spread, the Creeper was caught. The first online community     Larry Brilliant, co-creator of the first online community Photograph: New York Times    In 1981, while working for the WHO, Dr Larry Brilliant (below) created a primitive online conferencing system. Its original purpose was to organise the rescue of a helicopter downed on a humanitarian mission in Nepal. On his return to America, Brilliant showed his system to Apple founder Steve Jobs and, on his advice, launched a modified version of the software that would run on people&apos;s home computers. The next step was to develop a permanent text conferencing system \u2013 what we now know as an internet forum. The first example, known as the Well , began with a meeting between Brilliant and Stewart Brand, then editor of the Whole Earth Catalog , an early green-living manual. Brilliant pitched Brand an idea: he would use a version of the software to create a discussion forum for the items in the catalogue. &quot;But Stewart had the good sense to ignore my idea and instead he just opened it up for discussions of any kind,&quot; Brilliant recalls. &quot;It was the best discussion \u2013 of the meaning of life, sexual practices, travel advice, love, law; everything you find on the internet today except the commercialism.&quot; Brilliant adds: &quot;About 99.9% of what made the well great was Stewart&apos;s ideas of what could be talked about and his uncanny ability to bring online the smartest people of the day \u2013 senators, governors, campaigners and a whole lot of writers.&quot; The first smiley Professor Scott E Fahlman (below) worked at the computer science department at Carnegie Mellon in the early 1980s, at a time when it was making heavy use of online bulletin boards. Often someone would make a sarcastic remark and a few readers would fail to get the joke. At one point a humorous comment on the boards about a brainteaser involving mercury was interpreted as a safety warning, nearly causing the building to be evacuated. The group began devising some form of punctuation to mark posts that weren&apos;t to be taken seriously. It was Fahlman who suggested :-). &quot;I was probably not the first person ever to type these three letters in sequence, perhaps even with the meaning of &apos;I&apos;m just kidding&apos; and perhaps even online,&quot; Fahlman concedes. &quot;But I do believe that my 1982 suggestion was the one that finally took hold and spread around the world.&quot; The first multiplayer game Multiplayer games were developed inside the internet&apos;s first decade, paving the way for games such as Second Life that define much of internet culture today. Mud (which stands for Multi-User Dungeon) was the first text-based fantasy game, developed by programmers Roy Trubshaw and Richard Bartle at Essex University in 1978, allowing players all over the world to interact. Arriving in &quot;the Land&quot; at a cottage next to a cemetery, new visitors could figure out the extent of their abilities, then explore, kill things and score points, with the ultimate goal of reaching the wizards&apos; level. Bartle admits that they weren&apos;t trying to be pioneering: &quot;We didn&apos;t know we were the first, we didn&apos;t know that there weren&apos;t hundreds of these games. It was the best way I could articulate what I wanted to say about the real world \u2013 by creating another world.&quot; The first search engine While studying for his master&apos;s degree at Montreal&apos;s McGill University in 1989, Alan Emtage, a young computer scientist, was also working as a systems administrator for the university. But he found rooting around online to locate software for the students to be a bit boring, so set about streamlining the process. He developed a set of scripts which would run automatically every evening to build a single, easily searchable database. Once word got out that Emtage could find pretty much anything on the internet, inquiries flooded in. Two of his colleagues, Mike Parker and Bill Heelan, were brought in to rewrite the system with him, and this version was named Archie. Emtage was suddenly at the heart of an online revolution. &quot;By 1991, that one machine in our office running Archie was using half the bandwidth of eastern Canada,&quot; he says. &quot;Our school of computer science director, Renato De Mori, was approached at a conference by one of his peers, who congratulated him on Archie and what a splendid job we were doing at McGill. We had never told the faculty about it so he had no idea what it was \u2013 but he smiled graciously and said thank you. When he got back to Montreal, he wanted to know what the hell the guy was talking about.&quot; And why name it Archie? Because of Archie comics? &quot;It was 100% not named after the comics! I hate those comics, I think they&apos;re the most insipid piece of writing ever. It was just &quot;archive&quot; without a V.&quot; The first browser Strictly speaking, the first web browser was Tim Berners-Lee&apos;s WorldWideWeb, later renamed Nexus so as to avoid confusion with the web itself. Berners-Lee created the program in 1991 while working at Cern, the European organisation for nuclear research. However, WorldWideWeb ran exclusively on the Nextstep platform, the early precursor to Apple&apos;s Mac OS X, and never reached a mass market. The first popular browser was Mosaic, which is generally credited with spreading the casual use of the web around the world. Created by University of Illinois students Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, it was first released for computers using the Unix operating system on 23 January 1993. It built on Berners-Lee&apos;s server by including support for graphics, sound and video clips. After its popularity boomed in the academic community, Andreessen and several fellow students marketed Mosaic commercially. It was a huge success, granting hundreds of thousands of people their first glimpse of the web. The first webcam The first webcam began operating in 1991, the same year as Tim Berners-Lee&apos;s World Wide Web, and had its origins in an even more important topic in computer science: the flow of caffeine around a research group. The group, based in Cambridge University&apos;s computer lab and led by Dr Quentin Stafford-Fraser, had a problem: the coffee machine was shared by others in more distant parts of the building. &quot;These poor souls would often arrive, mug in hand, to find no fresh coffee,&quot; explains Stafford-Fraser. &quot;So one afternoon, friends and I gripped an old camera in a retort stand and connected it to a spare computer, then wrote a program [known as XCoffee] that allowed anyone in our group to display a live image of the pot in the corner of their screen. &quot;When, in 1993, web browsers were first able to display images, my colleague Dan Gordon modified the software so that a browser could take the place of our program. As a side effect, the whole world could see the image. Millions did, and so the first webcam was born.&quot; Coffeecam finally shut down in 2001, when the computer science department moved to a new building. The first blog The first blogger may never be identified for sure, but the most likely candidate is American freelance journalist Justin Hall, who began blogging (not that the term then existed) in 1994 with a website called Justin&apos;s Links From The Underground. Hall was online early enough to get first dibs on the coveted www.links.net URL, and his website began as a sort of guided tour of the internet. It wasn&apos;t long, however, before Hall&apos;s personal life became the principal topic. Hall wrote candidly about his relationships, passions, plans and fears, sharing just about everything with his loyal readership. At one point he took a road trip across America, updating readers along the way. As for the terms, &quot;weblog&quot; was coined by the Jorn Barger in December 1997, and later abbreviated to &quot;blog&quot; by his fellow American Peter Merholz. Whether he called it blogging or not, though, Hall had been at it years before everyone else. The first cyber cafe Cyberia, Britain&apos;s first cyber cafe (see left), was set up in 1994 on the ground floor of the EasyNet offices in Whitfield Street, central London. It was the brainchild of EasyNet founders Eva Pascoe, Gen\u00e9 McPherson, Keith Teare and David Rowe, and quickly became the place to be seen for the digerati, with Mick Jagger attending its website launch and its female founders attaining minor-celebrity status. The franchise was soon extended across the world \u2013 with outlets in Paris, Bangkok, Tokyo, Dublin, Edinburgh, Manchester and Rotterdam \u2013 but eventually folded, its founders moving on to other projects. Teare looks back fondly: &quot;It was 150 miles an hour for four years. And now there are hundreds of thousands of them, worldwide. Not Cyberias of course; just plain old cyber cafes. Never was a great business \u2013 but it\u00a0was a great experience.&quot; The first eBay sale The French-Iranian programmer Pierre Omidyar launched AuctionWeb in September 1995. It was later renamed eBay. There had been other virtual auction sites, but this one was better designed and better marketed. The first item to change hands at auction was a broken laser pointer offered by Omidyar himself, finally purchased for $14.83. Omidyar had the courtesy to contact the winning bidder and warn them they were buying faulty goods, but the buyer claimed to collect broken laser pointers, so the sale went through. The first Wikipedia entry &quot;Wikis&quot; date back to 1995, when software developer Ward Cunningham launched WikiWikiWeb, named after the shuttle buses at Honolulu airport (&quot;wiki&quot; means fast in Hawaiian, and in internet terms refers to the collaborative generation of content). The software&apos;s innovative application would later prove the key to the extraordinary success of Wikipedia, which itself originated in a free-content reference project known as Nupedia, founded in 2000 by American entrepreneur Jimmy Wales. Wales hired the philosophy academic Larry Sanger to run what they defined as &quot;a very open, very publicly editable series of web pages&quot;. The first article, quite randomly, was &quot;atonality&quot;, written by German academic Christoph Hust. But there was a flaw in the plan: after a year only 12 articles had been published because of the need for fact-checking and editing. It was not until 2004, when the collaborative wiki software was utilised, that Wikipedia was unleashed. Unfortunately, all of its original articles have been lost, as initially the software didn&apos;t save history as it does today. But the first words that appeared on Wikipedia, typed by Wales, were &quot;hello world&quot;. &quot;Once the wiki started, lots of people began to contribute, and that&apos;s when I realised it was pretty exciting and could really take off,&quot; Wales says now. &quot;Except that obviously it&apos;s a bit big bigger than I ever imagined.&quot; The first social networking site From the outset the internet was all about connecting people, with proto-social networks evident even in the early days of Arpanet and bulletin boards. But the pioneering US site Classmates.com was far closer to the model of social networking sites such as Facebook that dominate today, and inspired a host of imitations including Friends Reunited in the UK. Classmates.com began life in 1995 in the basement of former Boeing employee Randy Conrads. It was an instant hit, playing on many an American&apos;s desire to swap life stories with former friends or reignite a high-school romance (after the first 100 marriages, in 2002, they stopped counting). Conrads came up with the idea when he started attending reunions himself: &quot;I thought there was a lot of strength in high-school affinities, the desire to get together and travel long distances and spend a lot of money in hotels in order to talk to each other, and the internet, as it grew, could be a place for people to connect like that. I thought if I could do it for all high schools, maybe I could make a business.&quot; Conrads was the first person registered on the site, and soon he was not only rekindling friendships from the military school he attended abroad, but getting his classmates to invest in and work for the company. &quot;Running into those people again has been the start of several special relationships with some of the people I went to school with \u2013 not all, though.&quot; The first major dotcom failure     Kajsa Leander and Ernst Malmsten. Photograph: Tom Jenkins    It wasn&apos;t the first dotcom to go bust, but Boo was definitely the most high-profile of the first tranche of failures. Set up by two extremely well-connected Swedes, former poetry critic Ernst Malmsten and Vogue model Kajsa Leander, with the backing of some big business guns, Boo.com seemed to have a lot going for it when its was unveiled in the autumn of 1999. But the Boo story quickly morphed into an emperor&apos;s-new-clothes type yarn. Aspiring to be an online Harvey Nichols, it soon had a staff of 500 across seven countries hosting famously lavish parties. But the buzz dotcom brand of the moment was, in reality, a poorly functioning website in a market that didn&apos;t yet have the appetite to buy high-end designs online \u2013 these were the days of snail-paced internet connections and low-resolution design. Eighteen months down the line, with \u00a390m squandered, no one seemed that surprised when everything went horribly wrong. In his final memo to staff, Malmsten said simply: &quot;I&apos;m sorry that in the end we couldn&apos;t turn things around, and maybe that was my fault.&quot; The first YouTube video            It has been said before, but here it is again: YouTube is four years old. Four! The YouTube story began so astonishingly recently, in fact, that one of the events that inspired it was Janet Jackson&apos;s dress malfunction at the 2004 Super Bowl \u2013 or rather, the fact that you couldn&apos;t find footage of it anywhere on the web. Little over a year later, former PayPal employees Steve Chen, Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim had filled the gaping whole in the internet market for a video sharing facility. The first video on the site was posted on 23 April 2005, and remains there today. &quot;Me at the zoo&quot; is a man called Karim&apos;s 18-second long report from the elephant enclosure at San Diego zoo. It&apos;s both dull and awkward, enlivened only by a strange message flashing up half-way through exclaiming: &quot;Can you hear the goat. Meeeeeeh!!&quot; But its historical significance means that it has had well over a million hits so far.", "publicationDate": "2009-10-23T07:00:05Z", "tags": ["Internet", "Technology", "Digital media", "Media", "Email", "Tim Berners-Lee", "Search engines", "Blogging", "eBay", "Wikipedia", "YouTube", "Social networking"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/oct/23/internet-history", "title": "From the first email to the first YouTube video: a definitive internet history", "sentences": ["The franchise was soon extended across the world \u2013 with outlets in Paris, Bangkok, Tokyo, Dublin, Edinburgh, Manchester and Rotterdam \u2013 but eventually folded, its founders moving on to other projects."]}, {"article": "On the evening of 7 July 1978, Yasushi Chimura and his fianc\u00e9e, Fukie Hamamoto, drove in a small truck to a lookout point above the craggy coast that marks the city of Obama&apos;s meeting with the Sea of Japan. The waters were placid, and the couple were excited about their wedding in November. They were not alone. Agents from North Korea were on the hillside. They overpowered the couple, took them to a waiting boat on Wakasa Bay and transported them nearly 500 miles to the Communist country where they were to spend the next quarter of a century. The disappearance of the couple was a local mystery and might well have remained so had it not been for a seemingly unrelated event thousands of miles away in the Middle East. Nearly a decade after the Chimura abduction, two North Korean agents stepped on to a Korean Air flight in Baghdad bound for Bangkok. In Bahrain the agents disembarked, leaving a bomb on board. The Boeing 707 took off again, exploded in flight, and 104 passengers and 11 crew were killed. The agents were subsequently arrested while trying to leave the country. One, a 70-year-old, killed himself with a poison capsule. The other, 26-year-old Kim Hyon Hui, attempted suicide in the same fashion but was stopped. Kim was later flown to Seoul where a trial revealed a fact that would cause diplomatic reverberations: North Korea had been regularly abducting Japanese citizens to help train special agents. Those agents would then pass themselves off as citizens from Japan, take part in terrorist plots and blacken the name of that nation. North Korea&apos;s antipathy towards Japan was ingrained after years of, at times, brutal colonisation from the 1900s to the end of the second world war. For Japan the news was the piece of a jigsaw that went towards solving the puzzle of numerous unexplained disappearances. Concrete confirmation came in July 2002 when North Korea&apos;s leader, Kim Jong-il, admitted that &quot;over-zealous&quot; special forces had abducted a least a dozen Japanese citizens \u2013 men, women and children between the ages of 13 and 46. Eight had since died. &quot;It was regretful and I want to frankly apologise,&quot; said Kim. Chimura was one of those who survived, along with Fukie. They returned to Japan three months after Kim&apos;s admission, and after diplomatic wranglings were joined by their three children, who had been born in Pyongyang. Today, the family lives in Obama. But beyond these lives hopefully returning to normal, the anger of the Japanese government is plain to see. Last week Yukio Hatoyama&apos;s recently-elected government said it was launching an investigation into the abductions, an inquiry that would potentially identify scores more victims. Officially, 17 Japanese have been identified as abductees, although private groups put the number in the scores. Five have returned but the Japanese government contends that Pyongyang holds the remaining 12. Accounts of the eight deaths tell of some dying, remarkably young, from heart attacks, others suffering gas incidents, another killed in a road accident. Hiroshi Nakai, a cabinet member and minister of state for the abduction issue, said previous administrations had not been bold enough in their efforts. &quot;We are trying to start a new investigation with a new perspective on this issue. We think if we make further thorough investigations there would be more people who could be confirmed as abductees.&quot; At stake is not just the concern of the families but the delicate balance of diplomacy. Since North Korea carried out its first nuclear test the international community has been desperate to contain its proliferation. Six-party talks, including Japan, the US and China, have made arguably little progress. But in the latter days of the Bush administration and at the start of the Obama tenure, the US signalled a willingness to deal with Kim Jong-il directly. In August Bill Clinton became the highest-profile US visitor to Pyongyang when he secured the release of two American journalists captured while in a border area. There have also been face-to-face talks between diplomats as recently as last week in New York. Japan has viewed a thawing of relations between Kim Jong-il and the US with some concern and is determined the abduction issue will not be sidelined. &quot;Japan will never work on the normalisation of relations with North Korea without the resolution of the abduction issue,&quot; said Nakai. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter to Japan if the US normalises the relationship. The abduction issue is a roadblock \u2026 to normalisation for Japan.&quot; Meanwhile the Japanese government explores other avenues to keep the issue alive. It invites the media to visit the abduction sites \u2013 the Guardian took part in one for this article \u2013 and produces comic books and DVDs. It also broadcasts a daily three-hour shortwave radio programme to North Korea with taped messages from relatives and news from the homeland. Shigeo Iizuke has taken advantage of this to try to reach his missing sister, who vanished more than 30 years ago. In June 1978, Yaeko Taguchi, who was 22 and a bar worker, dropped her two children, aged one and two, at a daycare centre before going to work at the Hollywood cabaret in Tokyo&apos;s Ikebukuro district. She never arrived. Iizuke filed a report with the police and waited. Months turned to years. He and his wife adopted Taguchi&apos;s son, one-year-old Koichiro. Another sister took on the responsibility of raising the other child. Nothing was heard of Taguchi until the court testimony from Kim Hyon Hui, the Korean airline bomber. She confessed to being trained by a Japanese abductee for nearly two years prior to her terror mission. Subsequent investigations by Japanese authorities confirmed the teacher had been Taguchi. It also confirmed one of the key motives of the abductions. North Korea, sealed off from the world in a hermit-like state, needed its agents trained in the ways of foreign societies to be able to assimilate with those societies and pass unnoticed. &quot;My sister was a perfect candidate,&quot; says Iizuke. &quot;She had experienced married life, and children, was knowledgeable about fashions and trends and songs of young Japanese women. She was quite suitable to be a teacher of life to North Koreans.&quot; Now 71, with thinning, swept back hair, Iizuke clutches a picture of Taguchi, a laminated image of a woman with eyes closed in laughter, a broad smile spreading across a grainy face. He says he knows she is not dead, despite the insistence of North Korea. He has also since garnered more information about her desperate struggle against her abduction. &quot;It seems she was deceived and taken somewhere, maybe under the influence of a sleeping pill,&quot; said Iizuke. &quot;She was taken to a beach and although her route is sill not clear \u2026 she was taken to North Korea that way. When she came to, she was wrapped in a black bag. She begged the agent; she had left two small children behind.&quot; Iizuke, founding member of the Association of the Families of Victims Kidnapped by North Korea, firmly believes Japan now has to press harder for his sister&apos;s return. And he points to his adopted son as evidence for that. &quot;The boy my sister left behind in Japan was one year old. He&apos;s now 31. He does not remember anything about his mother. He does not remember her voice, he does not remember the warmth of her skin. Her son desperately wants to know of the reality of his mother.&quot; The disappeared Megumi Yokota The youngest, she was just 13 when taken in November 1977. Some believe she was a mistaken target, having witnessed agents in action. DNA analysis of ashes returned to her family proved it was not her. Yaeko Taguchi Abducted in June 1978. She was taken to North Korea and forced to teach Japanese etiquette to an agent who helped explode a bomb on a Korean Air flight in 1987.

The central character is Pozdnyshev, who tells fellow train passengers how he killed his wife after she played the eponymous Beethoven sonata with her violinist lover. Tolstoy always hoped the piece would be performed with the music; now the Gate does so in a new adaptation by Nancy Harris.   Gate Theatre, W11, Thu to 5 Dec Mark Cook     Mrs Warren's Profession star Felicity Kendal.    Uncle Vanya, Bristol A co-production between the Tobacco Factory and BOV, this marks the first time that Shakespeare at the Tobacco Factory has staged a show at the King Street theatre. It signifies the new spirit of cooperation on the Bristol theatre scene, so it had better be good! The omens are terrific with director Andrew Hilton, whose plain Shakespeare productions have been such a pleasure over the last 10 years, already having cut his teeth on Chekhov with a very fine Three Sisters that was far funnier and more gloriously human than most. Uncle Vanya may be the most heartbreaking of all Chekhov&apos;s play, but its wry look at the foibles and self-deceptions of humanity makes it heartbreakingly funny, too, in the right hands. Bristol Old Vic, to 21 Nov  Lyn Gardner Mrs Warren&apos;s Profession, On tour Heading out on a big regional tour before looking for a West End berth, Michael Rudman directs Felicity Kendal as the mother who has done everything to ensure that her daughter, Vivie, will have an education, respectability and a comfortable life. Vivie has always been happy with her life, but as she reaches maturity she begins to question it, and when she discovers where the money she is living on came from, the relationship between mother and daughter faces its sternest test. If there is one Bernard Shaw work that deserves repeated views, it&apos;s this slippery and engaging drama of morality, a play that Shaw himself liked above all his many others. Even today the conundrum at its heart holds true, and it has two blistering roles for women.     The Habit Of Art.     Theatre Royal, Bath, Sat; The Lowry, Salford, Mon to 7 Nov Lyn Gardner The Entertainer, Manchester It is almost impossible to think of John Osborne&apos;s 1957 play without an image of Laurence Olivier as Archie Rice flashing into your mind. Nobody since has quite made the role so much their own, and Olivier&apos;s ghost haunts any production of the classic, just as the ghost of past glories and Empire haunt Osborne&apos;s sardonic play, in which little old England is a clapped out, end of a the pier show, and Archie himself a third-rate music hall artiste and leftover from a lost age. The latest actor to climb this mountain of a role is David Schofield (pictured), who returns to the Royal Exchange Theatre for the first time for 17 years. Roberta Taylor and David Ryall as Archie&apos;s wife and father also join the cast under director Greg Hersov, who had a previous notable Osborne success with a revival of Look Back In Anger, starring Michael Sheen, which transferred from Manchester to the NT. Royal Exchange Theatre, Wed to 5 Dec Lyn Gardner The Habit Of Art, London History is repeating itself on the South Bank as Alan Bennett, Nicholas Hytner, Richard Griffiths and Frances de la Tour are reunited for probably the most eagerly anticipated play of the year. They, of course, were all involved in the all-conquering The History Boys. Now Hytner is to direct Bennett&apos;s latest, The Habit Of Art, which imagines a meeting of poet WH Auden and composer Benjamin Britten 25 years after their previous collaboration. Britten, played by Alex Jennings, has just written Death In Venice, and comes to Auden (Griffiths) for advice. As the two quirky, cranky men are interrupted by a future biographer and a rent boy, Bennett&apos;s play reflects on desire, getting old, creativity and inspiration. Lyttelton Theatre, SE1, Thu to 24 Jan Mark Cook Ghosts, Bolton David Thacker has just had a big hit with one story of family secrets and lies, and now here he is with another. Swapping Arthur Miller&apos;s All My Sons for Ibsen&apos;s Ghosts, Thacker continues a theme in a production that relocates the play from Norway to Lancashire in the late 19th century. Here Oswald, an artist, returns home for the first time for many years to the house where his widowed mother is building a memorial to his dead father. But as long buried secrets are unearthed, it becomes clear that respectability has been built on shaky foundations.

But in the absence of any significant competition, Will Alsop persists in fitting the bill. What&apos;s he done this time? Not a new, eyebrow-raising ensemble of his trademark blobs and stilts, nor a provocative proposal to rebuild Croydon out of cheese (in 2007, he suggested flooding the south London suburb as part of a regeneration scheme). In fact, he&apos;s done the very opposite: in August, Alsop announced in the Guardian that\u00a0he was giving up architecture altogether. He was going to teach instead, as well as launch &quot;a serious inquiry into painting&quot;. It was a dramatic end to a career, although not\u00a0an entirely surprising one. Alsop&apos;s love of painting is well known, and financial difficulties had already forced him to sell his practice to a larger firm a\u00a0few years back. Now architecture had\u00a0become &quot;like pulling teeth&quot;, he\u00a0complained. But three months after his shock exit, Alsop is back. He has opened a new office under the umbrella of RMJM, another major British architectural firm. It turns out that the &quot;going off to paint&quot; line was just a ruse to throw his previous employers, Archial, off the scent, while he did some behind-the-scenes manoeuvring. He smirks when I ask him to explain himself. &quot;A: I didn&apos;t lie, and B: I have no obligation to the press,&quot; he says. &quot;I\u00a0was painting, and there&apos;s quite a bit of work in my Norfolk studio to prove it. On the other hand, you could say I\u00a0always paint anyway. I&apos;ve also been doing a little bit more teaching, at Ryerson University in Toronto. So I wasn&apos;t lying there. It&apos;s just that I didn&apos;t say what else I was doing.&quot; He is now heading up RMJM&apos;s London office, which is to be known as &quot;Will Alsop at RMJM&quot; (&quot;It sounds a bit like Gordon Ramsay at Claridges, doesn&apos;t it?&quot;). For the moment, his new Battersea studio looks more like a workers&apos; canteen; the former industrial space is still mostly empty desks. There are fewer than 10 employees here, and one telephone line, although they will soon be joined by staff from RMJM&apos;s existing office in east London. There is, however, a chipboard wall already plastered with plans and sections of a new skyscraper (new projects in the Middle East and South Korea is all he will reveal), while a few of Alsop&apos;s large, colourful, semi-abstract paintings lean against the walls. &quot;Once we&apos;ve got it organised, it&apos;ll feel like an Alsop studio,&quot; he says. &quot;Paintings and models, slightly scruffy, which I think is important. This space isn&apos;t roughed up enough yet. It should feel like a workshop.&quot; Alsop has always been the frustrated-artist type of architect. His built work is like his paintings: full of bold gestures, bright colours and patterns. When it works, it&apos;s playful and unique, like his Stirling prize-winning Peckham Library in south London, with its copper-green cladding and jaunty orange &quot;beret&quot; sitting on top, the whole top-heavy form held up by wonky stilts. When it doesn&apos;t work, the failure is all the more public, as with, The Public, West Bromwich&apos;s faltering interactive art gallery, where Alsop&apos;s brash black-and-pink, blobs-and-all design only drew more attention to its technical and financial troubles. The Public is now up and running, at last, but not before it had made another dent in Alsop&apos;s increasingly battered reputation. Even with a bog standard building type, you can count\u00a0on Alsop to inject some of his considerable personality into it, as with\u00a0his recent Palestra in south London \u2013 a top-heavy\u00a0office block with\u00a0jazzy glazing patterns, or his new Chips apartment block in Manchester, its bright-coloured facades emblazoned with giant lettering. Marking your spot on earth Alsop doesn&apos;t see the point of architecture that simply blends in. &quot;I\u00a0have done lots of work with the general public, and what I hear over and over again is that people are looking for something that marks their spot on the earth&apos;s surface. Something that has an identity which they don&apos;t share with others,&quot; he says. The trouble is, it&apos;s become harder and harder for him to be the free-thinking architect. &quot;Very often the principal [architect] spends more time filling in VAT returns than getting on with what they spent seven years training to do,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s distracting. You need time and you need relative relaxation in order to work your way into a project, and if you don&apos;t do that you just end up repeating what you&apos;ve already done.&quot; Perhaps if Alsop had spent a little more time filling in those VAT returns, he might still be running his own practice. For 25 years he worked independently, his career a steady accumulation of awards and bigger commissions \u2013 until about a decade ago. The tipping point was probably a commission for the &quot;Fourth Grace&quot; for Liverpool&apos;s historic waterfront: Alsop beat Norman Foster and Richard Rogers to win the prestigious competition with his radical &quot;cloud&quot; structure, but it proved a poisoned chalice. His design drew fierce public criticism, major changes were called for, costs spiralled, and then finally the scheme was shelved in 2004. Several other projects fell through shortly afterwards (a building in Bangkok, a development in Manchester) , and there just wasn&apos;t enough money to see the practice through its lean patch. &quot;We should have been covered and we were not covered financially. That pissed me off,&quot; he says. &quot;I paid the price for my disinterest in that side of architecture \u2013 as a business.&quot; In 2005, Alsop sold a 40% stake in his firm to venture capitalists. A year later, Alsop Architects was bought in its entirety by SMC, a publicly listed new architectural group that was then aggressively acquiring small regional British practices. Within a couple of years, SMC became the fourth largest architectural firm in the country, with Alsop the jewel in its crown. But they were plagued by internal issues that saw SMC&apos;s founder, Stuart McColl, ejected and the name changed to Archial. Then the credit crunch bit, and Archial posted a loss of \u00a34.3m for the first half of this year. &quot;I don&apos;t think the plc as a model works very well in architecture,&quot; Alsop says of SMC/Archial. &quot;Rather than architectural intent, a number of decisions were made purely on a financial basis. The main board only had one architect on it.&quot; Alsop still had creative freedom, but his offices in Toronto and Singapore were closed down. &quot;I had my wings clipped.&quot; Did it become acrimonious? &quot;No,&quot; he smiles. &quot;Just boring.&quot; On the face of it, there&apos;s not a huge difference between Alsop&apos;s previous role and his new one. But RMJM has a better pedigree: it was one of the key modernist firms of the 1950s and 60s, and has made a huge impression on the\u00a0landscape of postwar Britain, from university campuses and housing estates to London&apos;s Commonwealth Institute, right up to the Scottish Parliament. Like SMC, it has also stepped up its expansion drive under new CEO Robert Morrison (a former army officer and a non-architect). Morrison thinks the industry is due for\u00a0a major shake-up. &quot;You saw it in marketing in the 70s, where WSP and Saatchi came along and looked at an industry which was largely made up of\u00a0small companies. This is a very fragmented sector, and I strongly believe that over the next decade or two that&apos;s got to change dramatically, and the emergence of one or two superfirms is an inevitability.&quot; As well as Alsop, RMJM has collaborated with other well-known architects, such as Frank Gehry and Jean Nouvel, although nothing has yet\u00a0come of these partnerships. Perhaps Morrison&apos;s vision really is the\u00a0future of architecture: a handful of\u00a0global &quot;superfirms&quot; with the odd star name attached for a dash of creative flair. But most architects hope\u00a0not. Drawing, painting, dreaming Only 10% of RMJM&apos;s work is now in the\u00a0UK;\u00a0it is involved in several major international projects, such as Gazprom&apos;s controversial skyscraper in\u00a0St Petersburg. Critics say the firm&apos;s growth has come at the cost of its identity, and that it is producing less remarkable work these days. Of course, it would be good to see Alsop return to form. His Stirling Prize was nearly 10 years ago. But even if he&apos;s no longer quite the enfant, his appetite for the terrible seems to be undiminished. He&apos;s looking forward to doing what he\u00a0enjoys most: &quot;drawing, painting, dreaming and working on architecture&quot;, albeit with the benefit of\u00a0a\u00a0large safety net. Professionally, this new marriage might turn out to be a happy one. Or it\u00a0might last as long as Alsop&apos;s previous\u00a0engagement. Either way, there is no chance of him ever really giving up architecture to go off and paint, Alsop admits. He will never retire. &quot;Painting to me is a\u00a0way of exploring architecture, anyway,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s all the same thing. If I\u00a0spent all my time painting, it\u00a0wouldn&apos;t mean I&apos;d given up thinking about architecture. I can sit in my studio on a Saturday morning and find something on a large piece of paper, and the feeling that you get is almost as\u00a0good as having finished a building that&apos;s turned out all right. It&apos;s not about designing something, it&apos;s about\u00a0discovering what something could be \u2013 and I think that&apos;s a very important distinction.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-11-02T21:30:02Z", "tags": ["Will Alsop", "Architecture", "Culture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/nov/02/will-alsop-architecture", "title": "Will Alsop returns to architecture", "sentences": ["Several other projects fell through shortly afterwards (a building in Bangkok, a development in Manchester) , and there just wasn&apos;t enough money to see the practice through its lean patch."]}, {"article": " Good evening all: The white flags have been laid down and the surrender monkeys are fighting back. It&apos;s been a good week so far for French clubs in the Champions League, with Bordeaux and Marseille notching up wins against Bayern Munich and FC Zurich respectively. Tonight Lyon will hope to make it a trifecta when they take on Liverpool in a match many visiting supporters are describing as &quot;the most important match this club has played since last Saturday&apos;s drubbing at the hands of Fulham.&quot;  Presuming that Fiorentina beat Debrecin in tonight&apos;s other Group E game, anything other than a win for Liverpool tonight will almost certainly end their hopes of making the knockout stages of this season&apos;s Champions League (progress would still be mathematically possible, but would require the kind of miracle Liverpool just aren&apos;t in the running for these days).  Arriving at the Stade Gerland on the back of six defeats out of their last seven matches in all competitions, Rafa Benitez has been further hamstrung by injuries to Steven Gerrard, Albert Riera, Martin Kelly, Martin Skrtel, Glen Johnson, Fabio Aurelio, Alberto Aquilani, Daniel Agger and David Ngog. Having not been named in his side&apos;s Champions League squad, Philipp Degen is also unavailable for selection. That said, Lyon come into tonight&apos;s game with problems of their own. Three central defenders down as a result of Jean-Alain Boumsong, Mathieu Bodmer and Cl\u00e9ber Anderson being out injured, manager Claude Puel was also forced to strip Sidney Govou of the team captaincy after the midfielder was photographed lurching around a nightclub a couple of days before Lyon&apos;s 1-0 win against the Sarah Cracknell fronted English dance act St Etienne.  Exciting team news: Despite being far from 100% fit, in need of a hernia operation and having had an artist&apos;s impression of his spermatic cord and scrotum published in the Sport section of yesterday&apos;s Guardian, Fernando Torres will start for Liverpool. Line-ups to follow ...  Lyon (4-3-3): Lloris, Reveillere, Cris, Toulalan, Cissokho; Pjanic, Makoun, Kallstrom; Gomis, Bastos, Lisandro.Subs: Vercoutre, Ederson, Govou, Delgado, Tafer, Gassama, Gonalons. Liverpool (4-2-3-1): Reina, Carragher, Agger, Kyrgiakos, Insua; Lucas, Mascherano; Kuyt, Voronin, Benayoun, Torres.Subs: Cavalieri, Aquilani, Babel, Ngog, Spearing, Darby, Ayala.  Referee: Frank De Bleeckere (Belgium)  First email of the evening: &quot;What a vile Liverpool lineup,&quot; writes Rich Wellum. &quot;Torres and Benayoun apart, there&apos;s more talent to be seen at a cross-dressing Carnage party in Brighton.&quot;  That really annoying advert for a well known betting exchange has just been on. You know, that one where Danny Baker does the voiceover and a load of thirtysomething actors pretending to be football &quot;fans&quot;/white van driving &quot;geezahs&quot; are sitting around a testosterone-charged betting &quot;front room&quot; (whatever the eff that is) discussing ... y&apos;know, football. And who&apos;s team is ... y&apos;know, the best. A couple of them look as if they&apos;re about to square up like a pair of chimps, but eventually decide to put their money where their mouths are instead. And that&apos;s it. There&apos;s no punchline. No jokes. No gag or point of any kind ... so much so that a mate of mine thought these were actually genuine punters, not actors.  I disagreed.  After looking as if we were about to square up like a pair of chimps, we decided to put our money where our mouths were. I won \u00a310 from him by proving one of the people involved was Northern Ireland comedian Michael Smiley, a Brixton resident who played Tyres O&apos;Flaherty in Spaced.  Pre-match niceties: Click-clack! Click-clack! Click-clack! The teams emerge from the tunnel, with Lyon&apos;s players kitted out in navy strip with red trim and Liverpool&apos;s in all white.  1 min: Liverpool kick off. They&apos;ve got out of stickier situations than this one in the Champions League before, but never with a team that looked this dismal on paper. The first throw-in of the night goes to Liverpool and their stand-in right-back Jamie Carragher takes it.  2 min: Liverpool have lined up with Torres alone up front with Voronin behind him and Kuyt and Benayoun to his right and left respectively. Lucas and Mascherano are patrolling the space between them and the back four of Carragher, Agger, Kyrgiakos and Insua. Jayzus wept. That&apos;s a Liverpool  team? Seriously? If they sent that side to play your pub-team in a pre-season friendly you&apos;d be underwhelmed and have every right to feel aggrieved.  3 min: Dirk Kuyt swings a cross into the Lyon penalty area from the right wing, in the general direction of Fernando Torres. Cris clears.  4 min: In a challenge with Lisandro, Jamie Carragher handles the ball, then bundles the Lyon striker off the ball, prompting the referee to blow his whistle and award a free-kick to the home team in the Liverpool right-back position. &quot;What for?!?!&quot; screeches Carragher, putting his hands on his head. Take your pick, Jamie.  7 min: Nothing comes from the free-kick. Moments before it was awarded, Lyon had the first shot of the night in anger, when a Michel Bastos 25-yard drive bounced in front of Pepe Reina, prompting the Liverpool goalkeeper grasped it to his chest.  8 min: Lyon attack down the left, courtesy of full-back Cissohko. He squares the ball across the edge of the penalty area, where Lisandro lays it off to Bastos. His shot is blocked.  9 min: For Lyon, Jean Makoun tries a shot from long range. High and wide. He&apos;d been given the ball by Cris, who&apos;d dispossessed Torres with a fine tackle on the right touchline and advanced up the field before teeing up his team-mate.  11 min: Insua advances down the left wing for Liverpool and attempts to squares a low ball into the Lyon penalty area. It takes a defelction off a defender on the way, bounces into the path of Torres standing about 12 yards out from goal. He snatches at it and prods the ball straight at Hugo Lloris in the Lyon goal. He should have scored.  14 min: Lyon attack down the left wing courtesy of Cissokho again. He sends a low cross into the Liverpool penalty area, which Daniel Agger hacks clear. The ball returns with interest when Lisandro tries a shot from distance. His effort is on target, but doesn&apos;t trouble Reina.  16 min: Liverpool go close again. Insua gets another ball in from the left, the ball bounces nicely for Kuyt in the penalty area and instead of blasting it past Lloris, he tries to place it and the goalkeeper is able to stretch out a hand and tip his effort over the bar. From the ensuing corner, Kuyt gets a near-post flick-on, but there&apos;s nobody at the back post to capitalise.  18 min: Lyon substitution: right-back Antoine Reveillere goes off, presumably injured, to be replaced by Lamine Gassama, a 20-year-old making his first appearance of the season.  20 min: Gassama gets his first touch of the season, picking up a pass and prodding the ball through the centre circle for Miralem Pjancic to chase. Sotiros Kyrigiakos beats him to it.  21 min: A reader has written in to accuse me of being racist for calling the French surrrender monkeys, while another, Thomas Cope, wants to know why both tonight&apos;s teams are playing without shirt sponsors.  25 min: Liverpool string about 30 passes in a row together to get the ball from thjeir goalkeeper Pepe Reina all the way up the field and then all the way back down the field to Pepe Reina. For a side that has to win tonight, they&apos;re doing a very passable impersonation of a team that would be more than content to draw.  27 min: Voronin blows a great chance to put Liverpool one up having been put clean through on goal by a long ball from Lucas in midfield. He let the ball drop over his right shoulder and bounce in front of him, but with only Hugo Lloris the Lyon goalkeeper to beat, he side-footed a feeble effort straight at him. Where&apos;s the guile? Why didn&apos;t he just blast it?  30 min: &quot;Alcohol sponsorship is banned in France,&quot; writes Rob Sutton. &quot;That is why Liverpool have none tonight. Lyon have none because they are French and no one wants to sponsor them.&quot;  31 min: The referee reaches for his pocket, pulls out a yellow card and waves it in Daniel Agger&apos;s face after penalising the Liverpool centre-half for a foul on Gomis. It was a fair kop.  33 min: Lisandro gets booked for upending Dirk Kuyt. &quot;Monsieur Tual has it wrong,&quot; writes Brent Braga. &quot;France is a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic nation. Your referring to the French as &apos;surrender monkeys&apos; is chauvinistic, not racist.&quot;  34 min: Elsewhere in this group, Fiorentina are beating Debrecen 1-0 in Italy. If the scores were to remain the same in both matches, Liverpool would be in third place, five points behind Fiorentina, with only two games to play.  36 min: Agger and Benayoun combine well down the left wing, with the Israeli eventually pulling the ball back from the byline, only to see nobody following up in support. Liverpool are definitely having the better of things the longer the half goes on, but still appear to be playing very cautiously.  37 min: From the right flank, Carragher sends a searching cross into the Lyon penalty area. Benayoun contests the high ball, but Gassama the substitute heads clear.  39 min:Lyon are forced into another substitution: Miralem Pjanic, injured in a challenge with Emiliano Insua, off; Ederson on. It&apos;s a straight swap: one right sided midfielder for another.  41 min: Good news for Liverpool - Debrecen have equalised with Fiorentina in Italy.  42 min: &quot;Liverpool have to play cautiously,&quot; writes Richard in Bangkok, by way of reply to my comment in the 36th minute. &quot;Insua could lose an elephant in a field and Kyrgiakos and Carragher can&apos;t tackle.&quot; To be fair, Richard, Insua is doing quite well tonight ... in so far as he hasn&apos;t given away any goals to the opposition and has got two crosses into the Lyon penalty area. Needless to say, he&apos;s now being patronised to within an inch of his life by ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley. There are someplayers on this Liverpool team who he&apos;d praise if they successfully put one foot in front of the other without falling over.  45 min: Liverpool win a free kick, just inside the right touchline, way, way out. Voronin sends it into the penalty area, Mascherano falls over and Toulalon heads clear.  45+1 win: Liverpool win a corner which Voronin refuses to take, getting Benayoun to do so instead. Is the Ukrainian&apos;s confidence so shot to pieces that he&apos;s too much of a nervous wreck to take a corner now?  Half-time: Liverpool go into the break all square with Lyon, knowing they could be three up and should be at least one up. They should win comfortably if both teams keep playing like they have been for the past 30 minutes.  Half-time query: &quot;If the teams haven&apos;t got adverts on their shirts how will we know what to buy?&quot; asks David Barratt, not unreasonably.  Pompey Pete writes: &quot;Carlsberg have missed a trick on the shirt sponsorship thang. If Heineken can get round the Gallic &apos;booze ban&apos; with a board on the half-way line with a quite wanky &apos;Star Experience&apos; line, why don&apos;t Liverpool go for &apos;Probably ...&apos; on their shirts? It would allow hacks all over the world to insert such classics on tomorrow&apos;s back pages as &apos;... sacked in the morning!&apos; or &apos;... the best odds for the next managerial dismissal&apos; etc and so on. Looking forward to your Football Weekly ... Extra vidcast tomorrow.&quot; Oh, that. At 7.30pm GMT? Tomorrow? I&apos;m not looking forward to it one bit. Probably ... the worst idea in the history of Guardian multimedia innovations.  Ed Whatley is here to take exception with Richard in Bangkok&apos;s match analysis in the 36th minute. &quot;Carragher can&apos;t tackle?&quot; he harrumphs. &quot;So probably the last 10 years have been filled with last ditch cake-baking sessions, well timed bon mots or forceful diplomatic interventions. Not tackles. The 400 odd appearances have all been at centre-forward, right? Christ.&quot; That&apos;s your fabled Scouse sense of humour right there, folks. You leave the words &quot;any more&quot; off the end of an email and those pedantic Liverpool fans swarm all over you like locusts.  Second-half: An indignant Pompey Pete has written to point out that his name is actually Pompey Paul. Pete/Paul/To-may-to/To-ma-to. While I&apos;d usually bow to a correspondent&apos;s superior knowledge in such matters, I prefer Pompey Pete, so that&apos;s what it is from now on. I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve been called worse and it&apos;s not as if you don&apos;t have more important things to be worrying about.  46 min: Lyon are harshly denied a free-kick right on the edge of the Liverpool penalty area when Lisandro is fouled by Insua. Some referees would have given a penalty for that.  47 min: Lyon attack down the right flank, Cissohko crosses from the touchline and Ederson sends a volley high over the bar.  48 min: &quot;Wales&apos; rugby team is sponsored by Brains, a Cardiff brewery. When they play in France, they replace &apos;Brains&apos; with &apos;Brawn&apos;,&quot; writes Nath Jones. And there was me thinking they replaced it with Katherine Jenkins.  50 min: &quot;On RTE, Johhny Giles has asserted that anybody would be better on the pitch than Andriy Voronin,&quot; writes Dave Mc. &quot;As someone who still gets cold sweats when contemplating Djimi Traore&apos;s contributions in a red shirt, I can&apos;t but disagree.&quot;  51 min: Liverpool attack down the left wing, with Benayoun feeding Insua on the overlap. The full-back sends another cross into the Lyon penalty area, but it&apos;s hacked clear.  52 min: ITV1&apos;s man on the touchline has been speaking to Lyon&apos;s manager, who thinks that his players have been overawed by the occasion and are concentrating too hard on playing for the draw that would see them through, rather than the win.  53 min: Lyon embark on a sortie into Liverpool&apos;s half, but Javier Mascherano dispossesses Kim Kallstrom. Throw-in for Lyon. In Florence, the locals have gone 2-1 up against Debrecen.  55 min: &quot;As if I&apos;m Scouse,&quot; writes Ed Whatley, harrumphing for the second time tonight. &quot;I&apos;m a Liverpool fan, I&apos;m from somewhere indistinct in Surrey.&quot;  56 min: Lyon attack again. Lisandro plays the ball down the left touchline for Cissokho to chase. He sends in a cross which Bastos heads over from about 14 yards.  57 min: Reina rushes out of his area, beats the dreadlocked Gomis to a through-ball from the middle and heads clear. Fiorentina 3-1 Derbecen. Liverpool really need to win this game or they&apos;re as good as out of the competition and consigned to Europa League hell.  60 min: About five yards outside the Liverpool penalty area, Gomis is surrounded by four Liverpool players with no team-mates near him. There&apos;s nowhere for him to go, but Andriy Voronin decides to slide in and foul him anyway, moronically conceding a free-kick. Kim Kallstrom fires it high and wide.  61 min: Fiorentina 4-1 Debrecin. Liverpool really, really, really need to win this game or they&apos;re as good as out of the competition and consigned to Europa League hell.  62 min: Corner for Lyon. Kim Kallstrom sends it in from the left but his inswinger is too deep for Makoun and headed clear by Dirk Kuyt.  63 min: Reina needs to stay on his toes as a miss-hit Cisshoko cross morphs into a shot and needs to be dealt with at the near post.  64 min: Benayoun plays the ball down the left wing to Torres, but Makoun tackles and clears the danger. Torres has had a very quiet night so far, but he&apos;ll probably be left on as anyone with an ounce of sense would prefer a 20% fit version of him to an Andriy Voronin firing on all cylinders ... if such a thing has ever been witnessed.  66 min: Voronin plays the ball into Torres, standing with his back to goal in the Lyon penalty area. He turns and shoots, but his effort is blocked.  66 min: Liverpool substitution Babel for Voronin.  68 min: Relentless pressure from Liverpool. From a narrow angle to the left of goal, Lucas shoots from a narrow angle, bringing a fine save out of Lloris. The ball bounces loose and, standing with his back to goal, Kuyt doesn&apos;t get much purchase on his attempted overhead kick and it&apos;s cleared on the line.  70 min: Lyon win a free-kick about 35 yards out. Michel Bastos gets it over the wall and it dips. Reina saves. In Florence it&apos;s Fiorentina 4-2 Debrecen. If Fiorentina win and this is a draw, a win for Lyon in Italy would put Liverpool back in the competition. Playing as cautiously and tentatively as they are tonight - surrender monkeys, anyone? - I wouldn&apos;t bet on them to beat anybody.  73 min: Reina saves again after Lisandro pre-empted a disastrous Kyrgiakos back-pass and tried to intercept it. The goalkeeper saw the danger coming and was alert enough to get to the ball first. In Florence, it&apos;s Fiorentina 5-2 Debrecin.  76 min: Quarter of an hour to go and Liverpool really need to score. Lyon have used their last substitution, bringing their beer-drinking, disco-dancing former captain Sidney Gouvou on for Gomis.  77 min: Lyon go on the counter, the ball is played to Lisandro Lopez and he cuts in from the right past two Liverpool defenders. From the edge of the penalty area on the right hand side, he tries to curl a shot around Reina and inside the far post. Wide.  79 min: Daniel Agger pulls down Ederson about three yards outside the Liverpool penalty area, well right of centre. Ederson appeals to the referee to show Agger a second yellow card, but none is forthcoming. Kellstrom sends the free-kick high over the wall and the crossbar.  GOAL! Lyon 0-1 Liverpool (Babel 82)  From the inside left channel, Ryan Babel cuts inside three defenders and unleashes an unstoppable right-footed drive from 30 yards that screams past Hugo Lloris into the top left-hand corner. That was an amazing goal.  84 min: Liverpool win a free-kick in the Lyon right-back position. Babel decides to take it and, with team-mates queuing up in the penalty area, he sends a wayward shank out for a throw-in at the opposite side of the field. The word &quot;inconsistent&quot; is bandied about when men talk of the Dutchman and he&apos;s demonstrated exactly why in the last few minutes.  86 min: Liverpool substitution: Fernando Torres off, David Ngog on.  88 min: Down in the left corner, Yossi Benayoun plays the ball into the Lyon penalty area, teeing up Ryan Babel. From a narrow-ish angle, he takes a wild slash, sending his shot wide.  GOAL! Lyon 1-1 Liverpool (Lisandro 89) The ball is swung across the edge of the Liverpool penalty area from the left. Bastos leaps and flicks the ball goalwards, Lisandro muscles Kyrigiakos off the ball and pokes the ball past Reina into the top left-hand corner. Liverpool are back in the mire.  90+1min: It&apos;s all over. The surrender monkeys have, eh, come back at the death and sucker-punched Liverpool for the second time in a row. They&apos;re through to the last 16 and while Liverpool aren&apos;t out of the competition, they&apos;re in all sorts of bother.  How the group stands. With two games to go, Lyon are through with 10 points, Fiorentina are next with nine and Liverpool are in third place with five points. Debrecin are in fourth place with no points. Liverpool need to beat Fiorentina and Debrecin, while hoping Lyon do a number on the Italians too. It&apos;s possible, but very unlikely.  In his post-match interview, Jamie Carragher says that he still believes his team can go through to the knockout stages, but says that it &quot;won&apos;t be the end of the world&quot; if they don&apos;t. &quot;Liverpool will go on, don&apos;t you worry about that.&quot; He&apos;s dead right too. &quot;Good Premier League football team isn&apos;t quite as good as it used to be,&quot; isn&apos;t quite the sensational headline some hysterical journalists and fans are making out.  With Manchester City drawing their last four in the Premier League and Aston Villa going down 2-1 to West Ham tonight, it&apos;s not as if the usual also-rans are queueing up to take their place in the Big Four pecking order, is it? \u2022 This article was amended on 25 January 2009 to remove the name of a reader, at his request.", "publicationDate": "2009-11-04T14:34:34Z", "tags": ["Champions League", "Lyon", "Liverpool", "Football", "Sport", "Champions League 2009-10"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/nov/04/champions-league-lyon-liverpool-latest", "title": "Champions League: Lyon v Liverpool - as it happened", "sentences": ["42 min: &quot;Liverpool have to play cautiously,&quot; writes Richard in Bangkok, by way of reply to my comment in the 36th minute.", "Ed Whatley is here to take exception with Richard in Bangkok&apos;s match analysis in the 36th minute."]}, {"article": "At 8am on Wednesday 7 October, a smartly dressed fiftysomething Filipino woman took the escalator to the first floor of the UN building in Bangkok and merged into a throng of diplomats, civil servants and environmentalists arriving for the eighth day of the ninth session of the global climate talks. She was met with a few respectful nods. Bernarditas de Castro Muller \u2013 &quot;Ditas&quot; to her chums \u2013 chatted to a journalist and a colleague, and then went to work in conference room 1. She spread her papers in front of her, stood up and began to belch fire, tearing the flesh off three Americans and chewing two Europeans. After swallowing them whole, she sat back down. She didn&apos;t, of course, but such is Bernarditas&apos;s reputation as a &quot;dragon woman&quot; in the epic UN climate talks which should conclude next month in Copenhagen that if she had, no one (least of all the US and British governments who seem to fear and loathe her) would have been too surprised. In the outwardly polite yet vicious world of UN climate change diplomacy, where negotiators use every trick to further national interests and where battles rage over commas, colons and semi-colons, Bernarditas is seen by most poor countries as a heroic defender of their rights. But most rich countries paint her as a machiavellian, Soviet-style hardliner holding back an agreement to save the world.     Bernarditas de Castro Muller. Photograph: Gian Paul Lozza    Bernarditas is officially an environment adviser to the Filipino government, and lead negotiator and co-ordinator of the 130 developing countries in the umbrella group known as the G77 plus China. She negotiates in what is called &quot;the ad hoc working group on long-term co-operative action (AWG-LCA) process under the Bali action plan&quot;. In short, she represents the interests of nearly two-thirds of the poorest people of the world in the climate talks. It&apos;s her job \u2013 along with a few other G77 negotiators \u2013 to keep together the traditionally squabbling poor nations at least until the major power blocks like the US and EU inevitably split and outmanoeuvre them. She must wrest the best possible financial deal for them by insisting that the rich countries commit to deep CO2 cuts. She is a pivotal figure in the talks, a lightning rod for western distrust and for southern hopes. But this sweaty Bangkok morning has started badly. Manila, the capital of the Philippines, 1,000 miles east, is literally under water following back-to-back typhoons and floods, and in the last few days there have also been a tsunami in Samoa and an earthquake claiming over 1,000 lives in Sumatra. Moreover, the climate talks on which UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has said &quot;the future of this entire humanity&quot; depends are deadlocked. Environmentalists say the series of disasters should concentrate minds, but with just six full negotiating days before world leaders join the final conference of the parties in Copenhagen, the diplomats of 181 countries present in Bangkok have failed to agree on the big issues: what carbon cuts rich countries should make, how much money the poor should get to help them adapt to climate change, and where that money should come from. A draft text has been hacked down by negotiators from 250-odd pages to half that, leaving the UN bureaucracy optimistic \u2013 but everyone knows it has been painfully slow. In these talks nobody moves until everybody moves, so most of the big issues will now only be resolved by politicians in late-night horse-trading sessions at very end of next month&apos;s talks in Copenhagen. But right now in Bangkok another matter is brewing that threatens to derail the negotiations and which illustrates the immense gulf that exists between rich and poor countries. The UN&apos;s Kyoto protocol, which has been signed by 184 countries and commits all the word&apos;s rich nations except the US to cut emissions, is the base of the present talks, but it has just come under massive attack. The US negotiating team, led by the bearded former climate thinktank scientist Jonathan Pershing, is playing traditional hardball diplomacy, stating categorically that it will not join Kyoto. There&apos;s nothing new in US intransigence on climate change, but in a dramatic development, Europe and Australia have just sided for the first time publicly with the US, arguing that the Kyoto treaty should now be ditched in favour of a new one to get the Americans on board. The poor, represented mostly by the G77 and China, are outraged. Why should the whole world change, they ask, just to accommodate the US? This Bangkok meeting should have been spent negotiating how far rich countries were prepared to cut emissions after 2012; instead countries like India and China have been told they, too, must all come up with quantifiable plans to cut their emissions \u2013 something not agreed before \u2013 and the rich seem to be ducking their commitments. If the climate talks are a game of diplomatic chess, the rich countries have just moved their white queen into the back row of the developing countries&apos; territory. But have they underestimated the reaction this will get? Can the G77 and China now gain diplomatic advantage? Are the industrialised countries threatening the talks by wanting it all their own way? Or will their bold move lead to a genuinely global agreement? Bernarditas, who insists she does not represent the views of the G77, is appalled. For her, the US and EU are not just illegally abandoning an international treaty but they are now jeopardising the credibility of international law and the UN system itself. She is contemptuous. &quot;Do the rich countries have any sense of life in the least-developed countries?&quot; she asks. &quot;I doubt it.&quot; &quot;I say, aren&apos;t we all in this world together? Didn&apos;t we all sign this?&quot; she says to a small audience in the UN coffee bar that morning, brandishing a\u00a0well-thumbed copy of the 20-page Kyoto treaty. She turns to page 7 where she has underlined paragraphs: &quot;Look!&quot; she says, jabbing the text with her index finger. &quot;Article 4. It says &apos;shall&apos;. That is legally binding. There are obligations here. The words are not there by chance. And there&apos;s the word &apos;fully&apos;. We spent hours on that word. We agreed on it. Are they saying it no longer applies? These are very serious negotiations. The Kyoto protocol is not a statement from a high-level meeting when they [politicians] go &apos;blah blah&apos;. They are not bound by that. Here they are bound. It&apos;s law! Why do they now want to kill Kyoto? A new agreement means we will have to go through ratification all over again. How long will that take? What if you do not ratify? What are we left with? If you throw this away\u2026? Every word in it means something important because it binds us to legal obligations.&quot; To negotiate successfully at this level means you must understand your opponents and are able to argue all night. Bernarditas does that, but friend and foe say she has a special advantage because she is not only a stickler for detail but she knows the UN climate change convention and the Kyoto protocol word for word. And because her negotiating days go back to the Rio Earth summit in 1992 when the first climate change treaty was signed, woe betide any young pup of a rich country negotiator who strays from the precise words. &quot;She is the protector of the convention,&quot; says a colleague (in the world of diplomacy no one wants to be identified). &quot;I&apos;d hate to negotiate against her. She reminds me of Humpty Dumpty when he said to Alice, &apos;When I use a word it means just what I\u00a0choose it to mean \u2013 neither more nor less.&apos; &quot; A western friend, who also asks not to be named, says: &quot;She is used by the G77 and China as the bad cop, the experienced negotiator past whom the inexperienced, naive and unsuspecting cannot pass. She has an old style of Soviet negotiating. She can go on for 45 minutes easily. It&apos;s a\u00a0method. It&apos;s attrition. Her start is from a stance of noncooperation. Success is seen as how much the opposition gives in, and how much you can extract. You have to start with something unbelievable and make concessions. Even the Americans quake in fear of her. She terrifies them.&quot; Bernaditas herself says: &quot;Few people have dealt with the talks since the beginning [like me] and can still remember what we wrote. The majority don&apos;t see what we fought so hard for. [They say] this or that sounds reasonable. But I say that the words matter. They don&apos;t mean the same thing to everyone but they determine the levels of the relationship. There are words that do not appear that we talk about for hours. &quot;I use their [the rich countries&apos;] language. I spell it better. I don&apos;t make grammatical mistakes like they do. It angers them. I never get angry, I&apos;m not subservient, nor impressed. They say, &apos;She cannot be right, she&apos;s only a woman and must be weak.&apos; &quot; &quot;Clearly she is successful,&quot; says a European observer. &quot;They would not employ her otherwise. But it would please the annex 1 [industrialised] countries a lot if she were not there. She is very dangerous to their interests. She doesn&apos;t hesitate to remind them all the time that they are in breach of their obligations. They roll their eyes and say, &apos;There she goes again.&apos; &quot; &quot;Actually, she&apos;s really like my mum,&quot; says a\u00a0young Malaysian barrister. &quot;She is sweet but very authoritative.&quot; Bernarditas de Castro Muller is a grandmother who lives in Geneva with her Swiss economist husband and is known among her colleagues for her sense of humour and babysitting skills. She has a house in Manila, and travels there regularly to see family, has lived in Kenya and worked as a full-time diplomat on just about every major global agreement on the environment of the last 20 years. Now, when she is not negotiating climate, she travels the world teaching diplomats from other developing countries how to negotiate. &quot;I am only a housewife, actually,&quot; she says. &quot;My husband doesn&apos;t even trust me with the household budget. My education was totally western and I have spent most of my life in Europe. I am living in two worlds but I am at home in both. I see poverty and how people must live in developing countries but I am fortunately not poor.&quot; Climate change is the most complex and satisfying of all the diplomacy she has done because it is science-based, it is about development, but mainly because there is so much at stake. Get it right, she says, and the world has the chance to both halt catastrophic climate change and find a better path to develop. Get it wrong and all the injustices and disadvantages that developing countries now face will be magnified 1,000 times in the coming years. &quot;Climate change is making the poor even more vulnerable and threatening to destroy their health and their homes,&quot; she says. She was persuaded to fight for climate justice when she went back to live in Manila after the downfall of President Marcos in the late 1980s. &quot;We happened to be chair of the G77. I listened to developing countries. I saw so much disadvantage there. The fact is they are very open and vulnerable. [It became clear] that the rich countries are freely exploiting, stealing practically, their resources. These countries do not have resources because they were so exploited in the past. &quot;I now see developing countries who have so little\u2026 they get peanuts. They think if someone gives them anything they should be grateful. [But] developed countries have taken on obligations to provide money. This is not voluntary bilateral aid, or charity that we are negotiating from the annex 1 countries. This is a commitment. &quot;When we were negotiating in the 1990s, all of us were caught up in environment and development. We were full of ideals. We said, &apos;Yes, we have to do something, because the world is getting lost.&apos; Now I tell the developing countries that I am not working for them but for their children&apos;s children and what we will leave the world.&quot; Even seasoned diplomats find the talks surreal, with an arcane language, logic and a pace of their own. In three years, they have gone well beyond being just about emission cuts and now embrace development, trade, finance, carbon markets, forestry, science and technology. Because they are so complex, most nations belong to one or another of the negotiating blocs, like the G77, the EU, the Alliance of small island states, or the African group. Negotiators are mainly anonymous civil servants who have some freedom to set positions but can hide from their public, which is mostly denied access to the talks. They admit to personal duels and tactical manoeuvres. Phrases that might protect the world&apos;s forests or condemn nuclear power may be there one day, but be removed the next, and no one can say why or who is responsible. But as the talks have progressed, so the negotiators admit to becoming lost in their own verbiage. There have been long debates over whether a comma, a colon or a semicolon should be used in the text; arguments have raged about the meaning of &quot;sustainable forest management&quot; as opposed to &quot;sustainable management of forests&quot;; and hours have been spent by nations debating the differences between &quot;economic development&quot; and &quot;sustainable development&quot;. Now the talks have invented their own language. There are Bingos (business and industry non-governmental groups) who discuss Mrvs (measurable, reportable and verifiable), Namas (nationally appropriate mitigation actions) and Napas (national adaptation programmes of action). One important section is known as Redd (reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation); another is called Lulucf (land-use, land-use change and forestry) which probably only 50 people in the world half-understand. Meanwhile, more than 100 &quot;non-papers&quot; have been issued which reflect nations&apos; points of view without being formal positions. &quot;It is easily the most complex piece of diplomacy ever devised,&quot; says one British diplomat. &quot;A set of interlocking negotiations taking place on parallel tracks, ranging from aviation to trade and forests to adaptation, finance and science. It&apos;s quite possible it will all collapse under its own weight. &quot;There are many people who try to keep the language incomprehensible. There&apos;s a relationship between power and transparency \u2013 it&apos;s about keeping people out. The only people who really understand the lingo are the people who wrote it. It needs another industry of people to translate the words so they can be understood. I remember my first experience in the negotiations. I concluded after 25 minutes that I was in a madhouse. It was one of the most professionally disconcerting experiences of my life,&quot; he says. He recalls seeing Bernarditas in action for the first time: &quot;There was what was called the Gang of Four \u2013 Bernarditas, a Chinese negotiator we called Professor No because he said no to everything, an Indian and a Saudi. They acted as the &apos;they shall not pass&apos; group. Bernarditas was scary. You could imagine her as one of the Gang of Four in the Chinese upheavals. She and Professor No were fighting a 1960s ideological war in which the rich were trying to screw the poor and vice versa.&quot; Several weeks later, this point was put to Bernarditas. &quot;What do they mean by ideological war?&quot; she thundered. &quot;What are they saying? They should specify. What do they not like? What do they mean by 1960s ideology? Fidel [Castro]? The opening up of traditions? Opposition to the colonial mentality? They have to specify what! No, I don&apos;t live up to their prejudices of what is a third-world woman, that&apos;s what they don&apos;t like about me. &quot;But if they mean 1960s ideology in the sense of keeping economic gains, yes. They just do not accept they have historical responsibility. It&apos;s like I burn down your house and you become rich but now they say you can pay for it yourself. Well, you might be rich, but your brothers and sisters also lost their houses. Are you free from responsibility because one member of your family becomes rich?&quot; She says the dice are loaded against the poor. Africa is experiencing climate change faster and deeper than almost anywhere else, and could be devastated within 30 years, yet its 55 countries have been offered no money by the rich to adapt and can afford to bring only 145 official delegates between them to Bangkok \u2013 just 8% of the total. Europe, however, has more than 450 delegates, with the UK, Denmark and US numbering 142 between them. At least 50 countries have only one or two, but the WWF, a\u00a0western conservation group, has a team of\u00a050 to lobby, observe and advise delegations, as\u00a0well as to brief the press. In comparison with the EU or the US, the G77 has no offices, no permanent staff and no budget to meet in advance of conferences. Moreover, while delegates from poor countries must grasp highly complex technical issues in their second or even third languages, big country delegations may bring legal advisers, interpreters and business consultants for each area of the talks, with many more experts held in reserve. The US or Japan may fly in people to advise them on the precise wording of a single paragraph, and as the talks reach their climax, rich countries will have whole teams of people to take it in turns to be on the frontline of the negotiations, staying fresh while their less well resourced opponents are exhausted. &quot;Most developing countries don&apos;t have enough people, they don&apos;t even understand the text. They are exhausted after a few days and cannot even get to the meetings,&quot; says Meena Rahman from Third World Network, an NGO based in Geneva which has followed the talks for years. &quot;They complain that they are marginalised, but there is nothing they can do. All the negotiations are in English and some just do not understand what is going on. It&apos;s accepted as a fact of life in the negotiations.&quot; From a poor country&apos;s perspective, it is easy to suspect institutional bias. The executive secretary of the talks is Yvo de Boer, a Dutch diplomat, who himself has succeeded another Dutchman. His deputy is Canadian, and many of the senior secretariat and core groups are staffed by middle-aged white men. The media at the talks is mostly western and the language throughout is English. &quot;Of course we complain all the time,&quot; says an African diplomat. &quot;If you control the process, you control the discussion and the texts. That&apos;s how you manipulate the outcome. It&apos;s very easy really.&quot; Is this a sensible or fair way to go about re-ordering the world&apos;s economies to counter something as important as climate change? &quot;No,&quot; says an exhausted Swedish diplomat in Bangkok. &quot;It&apos;s quite mad.&quot; As the talks conclude, the tactics get dirtier and the road to Copenhagen becomes increasingly ugly. Earlier this year, says Bernarditas, word was dropped by a British diplomat in a meeting with non-government groups that she was appearing overfriendly with the Saudi Arabian delegation because she had possibly accepted a house from them. The veiled accusation of bribery sped along the diplomatic grapevine. &quot;It was outrageous,&quot; says Bernarditas. &quot;I could not believe this.&quot; But while she suspected a crude attempt to smear her, she was unable to prove anything and last week the head of the UK negotiations, Jan Thompson, said categorically that no official complaint had been received. &quot;It&apos;s quite inconceivable. Bernarditas does not even need the money. She is incorruptible. That&apos;s why they hate her,&quot; says one of her colleagues. &quot;But she and the Saudis no longer sit near each other for fear that the rumours are restarted.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s an idiot putting that about. It will backfire. God, how stupid can you get!&quot; said a British observer. &quot;It&apos;s below the belt\u2026 we should not think the Brits are immune [from these tactics].&quot; Bernarditas herself stays aloof. &quot;Each one is looking for the weakness of the other. It&apos;s very vicious. But there are big commercial interests at stake. They exploit the weaknesses of people and exacerbate the differences between countries. It&apos;s part of the game,&quot; she says. So, too, is the rhetoric now being employed by leaders of rich countries in the last crucial weeks before Copenhagen. In meeting after meeting, presidents and prime ministers have used apocalyptic language to insist that the future of the world is at stake and everyone must play their part. It plays well in the north, but in many developing countries it rings hollow, where it is seen as a\u00a0precursor to blaming the poor if no deal is struck. The rhetoric is reciprocated with the poor: &quot;Developed countries have overconsumed their share of the atmospheric space \u2013 they ate the pizza and left us the crumbs,&quot; said ambassador Anjelica Navarro of Bolivia. &quot;They have a historical debt \u2013 a historical responsibility. We want our atmosphere back, how you do that, developed countries, is your problem.&quot; In a few weeks&apos; time the talks will reconvene possibly for the last time in Copenhagen under the glare of the world&apos;s media and with the extra ingredient of high emotion brought by thousands of environment, human rights and development groups from around the world. But in diplomatic terms, the real talks are nearly over, having taken place behind closed doors between fewer and fewer countries. In the last month, there have been high-level meetings in London, Beijing, Delhi and Washington, with the US, Europe, Japan and the EU all trying to work out their position and agree what offer they are prepared to make. &quot;They are now working together to split the developing countries, in order to weaken their political positions and isolate them before they make them offers and get their way,&quot; says Rahman. The way this is being done, she says, is via those countries who are most vulnerable to climate change. The British in particular have worked with the Maldives to form a new grouping, known as the &quot;group of vulnerable countries&quot;, a set of small island states and least developed countries who stand to disappear beneath the waves or be most affected by drought and flood. Next week, Bangladesh, Kenya and others will meet with British financial help in the Maldives, with rich countries invited to attend. &quot;They can expect tempting sweeteners to break away from the G77, and threats if they do not play ball,&quot; says Meena Rahman, who is also a former chair of Friends Of The Earth International. &quot;It looks brilliant in PR terms. It looks like the British are helping the weakest but they are really peeling off the poorest and weakening Kyoto and the treaty.&quot; Robin Gwynn, UK special envoy for vulnerable countries, insists this is far too cynical a view, saying no country has done more than Britain to give the poor a real voice in the talks. &quot;The effort has been very genuine. The moral case must be made to ensure a global deal.&quot; But another diplomat sees the tactical advantage in working with the poorest. &quot;If you can convince the most vulnerable countries that there is a serious funding offer on the table, then you can open up another front which helps a lot of third-party things. Tactics? It&apos;s never thought out before, it&apos;s always [negotiations] by the seat of the pants. There are too many events to react to. It&apos;s always chaotic. It&apos;s a weird game.&quot; In the end, exhausted ministers from the three great power blocks, the US, the EU and China, will probably make a deal of sorts between themselves in the small hours of 17 December in Copenhagen. By then, the world&apos;s really poor countries will have long been diplomatically blown away from the negotiations with promises of cash soon and greater reward later. The G77 and its negotiators like Bernarditas will congratulate themselves for obtaining the best possible deal in the circumstances and the rich countries will insist the world is on a new, cleaner, greener development path. There will be something for everyone because everyone wants something, and the politicians will be able to go home waving a communiqu\u00e9 that commits countries and industries to taking action to reduce emissions. Whether it is anywhere like enough, fast enough, to prevent a climate catastrophe, or is just or equitable, is another matter. Because in western diplomatic terms, if there is not complete failure, then there can be one of only two outcomes to these climate talks. Copenhagen must be either a success or a great success. It may clearly be a fudge, or even a cop-out, but for the politicians who must sell it back home, nothing else in the world can be countenanced.   \u2022 Join the 10:10 climate change campaign, which the Guardian is supporting, at 1010uk.org", "publicationDate": "2009-11-07T00:10:12Z", "tags": ["Climate change", "Copenhagen climate change conference 2009", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Green politics", "10:10 climate change campaign", "Kyoto protocol", "World news", "Global climate talks"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/nov/07/climate-change-talks-2009", "title": "Lifting the lid on climate change talks", "sentences": ["At 8am on Wednesday 7 October, a smartly dressed fiftysomething Filipino woman took the escalator to the first floor of the UN building in Bangkok and merged into a throng of diplomats, civil servants and environmentalists arriving for the eighth day of the ninth session of the global climate talks.", "But this sweaty Bangkok morning has started badly.", "Environmentalists say the series of disasters should concentrate minds, but with just six full negotiating days before world leaders join the final conference of the parties in Copenhagen, the diplomats of 181 countries present in Bangkok have failed to agree on the big issues: what carbon cuts rich countries should make, how much money the poor should get to help them adapt to climate change, and where that money should come from.", "But right now in Bangkok another matter is brewing that threatens to derail the negotiations and which illustrates the immense gulf that exists between rich and poor countries.", "This Bangkok meeting should have been spent negotiating how far rich countries were prepared to cut emissions after 2012; instead countries like India and China have been told they, too, must all come up with quantifiable plans to cut their emissions \u2013 something not agreed before \u2013 and the rich seem to be ducking their commitments.", "Africa is experiencing climate change faster and deeper than almost anywhere else, and could be devastated within 30 years, yet its 55 countries have been offered no money by the rich to adapt and can afford to bring only 145 official delegates between them to Bangkok \u2013 just 8% of the total.", "&quot;No,&quot; says an exhausted Swedish diplomat in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "The recent hospitalisation of King Bhumibol Adulyadej has brought Thailand&apos;s most daunting question to the fore.

At stake is the soul of an emerging Thailand, with far-reaching ramifications for developing democracies elsewhere as well as the broader international community. Thailand&apos;s colour-coated crisis pits largely urban, conservative, and royalist &quot;yellow&quot; shirts against the predominantly rural &quot;red&quot; columns of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. For much of Thailand&apos;s long economic boom of the past two decades, wealth resided mostly in the Bangkok metropolitan area, a boon to the burgeoning urban middle class, but deeply resented by the rural majority. While the rural population had more than enough to eat, their economic opportunities and upward mobility were limited by a shoddy education system and docile state-run media that fed them soap operas and official messages. For a nobody to become a somebody, all roads led to Bangkok and its prestigious prep schools and universities. Thailand&apos;s farms became increasingly alienated from the urban elite. Thaksin recognised this urban-rural divide and shrewdly exploited it, upending the elite consensus that had long prevailed. That consensus rested on a nexus of the military, the monarchy, and the bureaucracy. Military rule and putsches stemming from factional infighting among generals were the norm until the early 1970s, when university students overthrew a military dictatorship and opened up democratic space. Parliament, political parties, and politicians then came and went alternately with military coups, which invariably suppressed the maturation of democratic institutions. The rural-urban divide wedded the grassroots rural population to upcountry patronage networks and vote-buying, while elected politicians reaped their rewards through corruption and graft. In turn, the military stepped in from time to time \u2013 once every four years on average since 1932 \u2013 ostensibly to suppress corruption, but retarding democratic rule in the process. All this changed when Thailand promulgated a constitution in 1997 that promoted political transparency and accountability and government stability and effectiveness. Its logical but flawed outcome was the triumph of Thaksin and his once-invincible Thai Rak Thai party, which became the first to complete a full term and be re-elected \u2013 by a landslide in 2005. Thai Rak Thai&apos;s populism featured income redistribution, cheap healthcare, microcredit schemes, and a dazzling array of policy innovations that ushered Thailand into 21st-century globalisation. The direct connection of Thaksin and his party to the electorate bypassed and threatened the established trinity of institutions that had long called the shots in Thailand. Thaksin and his cronies handed the establishment an opportunity to strike back by abusing power and profiting personally from it. A billionaire telecommunications tycoon, Thaksin presided over the trebling of his family&apos;s assets in the stockmarket. He also engineered an extrajudicial drug-suppression campaign that claimed many lives. Thaksin&apos;s sins are voluminous, and became the basis of the rise of his yellow-shirted opponents, the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD), which entered the electoral arena as the New Politics Party. The PAD spent much of last year demonstrating against the two successive Thaksin-nominated governments that arose from the December 2007 election, reinvigorating Thai Rak Thai&apos;s anti-PAD red-shirted allies, the National United Front of Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD). After more than three years, Thailand&apos;s crisis has become a knotty saga. Abhisit&apos;s pledges of reform and reconciliation in the wake of April&apos;s riots have made little headway. The PAD wants to maintain the 2007 charter. The UDD favours reinstatement of the 1997 constitution. Enraged by a sense of social injustice, the reds rail against the establishment&apos;s double standards, while the pro-establishment yellows have hunkered down for a battle of attrition. In the process, what had been a pro- and anti-Thaksin fight has gradually become a pro- and anti-monarchy struggle. The rigidly hierarchical forces of the establishment are insecure and fearful of what will happen after the king dies. L\u00e8se majest\u00e9 cases alleging insults against the immediate royal family are on the rise. Many thousands of websites challenging establishment interests and deploring post-coup machinations have been blocked. Thaksin&apos;s appeal splits the reds. Many repudiate his corruption but, in challenging the post-coup status quo, have no recourse except to use him as a rallying symbol. Likewise, all yellows find Thaksin&apos;s misrule intolerable, but not all are fanatical royalists. A stalemate has taken hold, with the denouement likely to be reached only after the royal succession. A new consensus is imperative if Thailand is to regain its footing. That consensus would have to be based on mutual recognition and accommodation. The reds will need to distance themselves from Thaksin&apos;s abuses of power as much as the yellows will have to accept some of Thaksin&apos;s policy legacy, particularly grassroots opportunities for jobs, education, and upward mobility.

In the 1940s as a child she trudged the country lanes with her father in search of a bit of bread, stealing carrots from the fields as the Nazi occupation and slaughter engulfed Poland. In the 60s, as a young mother, she tramped miles across Warsaw through teargas and barricades to fetch her daughter from kindergarten as the hated riot police dealt with rebel students. In the 80s, the retired tax administrator kept her head down to survive communist martial law. &quot;People left home and did not return. We didn&apos;t know what happened to them,&quot; the 76-year-old recalled. &quot;If you said something random, you were in big trouble. Get beaten or sent to jail.&quot; Marta, her 24-year-old granddaughter, sighs impatiently. She&apos;s heard it all before. &quot;I&apos;ve never known a Poland like this. It&apos;s all just history. I&apos;m just happy I don&apos;t need to live in a world like that.&quot; Then Tereza summons a long-suppressed memory from the early 50s. She had a boyfriend at school. He took part in a protest against the Russians, then imposing Stalinism in Warsaw. The teenage boy vanished. &quot;They were arrested very quickly, taken to a terrible prison. He wrote me letters. But they were censored, bits blacked out.&quot; Monika and Marta, Tereza&apos;s daughter and granddaughter, turn damp-eyed at a little bit of family history they have never heard before. One country and one family. Three women, three generations, three Polands, exemplifying the change and social mobility wrought by the revolution symbolised by the fall of the wall. In recent years, Marta has been in Bangkok and Berlin, Cairo and Canada, London and Paris. She has her own firm teaching foreigners Polish and helping them set up some of the 1.7m businesses that have transformed Poland into one of the most dynamic and fastest-growing places in Europe, the only EU state not to dip into recession this year. Her grandmother&apos;s life spans Poland&apos;s authoritarian inter-war republic, 45 years of Soviet communism, and 20 years of independent democracy. Between the two of them, Monika, a 48-year-old divorced bank worker, says the communist years now seem like a distant bad dream. You couldn&apos;t buy toilet paper. There were ration cards, queues for bad sausage. If a delivery of new shoes appeared in a shop window, you just bought a pair whether they were the right size or not. She laughs: &quot;Everything was grey and ugly. When I think about my youth, it was all about trying to make things a bit more pretty and colourful. &quot;It&apos;s incredible how people lived. They were bugging the phones, you couldn&apos;t talk to people, you never knew who was listening to you or would use something against you. But nowadays we&apos;ve forgotten all that. It&apos;s like history, not part of your life any more.&quot; There is still, of course, plenty of greyness and ugliness in Poland. But 20 years after the fall of the wall, a revolution set in train in Warsaw 10 months earlier in 1989, Marta and her generation are too pushy, too busy, and too absorbed in their successful young lives and careers to sit around pondering politics or wondering how they got here. &quot;I know that Poland has changed incredibly. But for me it&apos;s been more to do with technology, mobile phones and the internet. Solidarity? I don&apos;t even know how the change in the political situation came.&quot; It came in February 1989, via the &quot;round table&quot;, the historic compromise struck by dissidents and ruling communists that ushered in a bloodless revolution and set the template for the liberation of the rest of Soviet Europe, a unique and triumphant dismantling of dictatorship peacefully that climaxed at the wall on a cold and damp Thursday evening 20 years ago this week.     Solidarity protesters march through the Gdansk shipyard in 1988, the cradle of opposition to the communist regime and which sowed the seeds of the 1989 revolutions across eastern Europe. Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex Features    The result two decades on, according to Adam Michnik, a giant of the revolution and one of the architects of the round table pact, is the most successful Poland in 300 years. The same might be said about the Baltic states, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, all in Nato, all in the European Union, and all in the throes of a huge catch-up exercise in modernisation driven by the transfers of tens of billions of euros from western to eastern Europe. &quot;You have a curious combination of external security and internal democratic order with a modest but successful economic system,&quot; says Andrzej Rychard, director of Warsaw&apos;s centre for social sciences. &quot;That hasn&apos;t happened that often in the history of this country.&quot; The change has been wrenching, its speed dizzying. Andrzej, who did not want his surname disclosed, is another whose life chances have been transformed. His father was a farmer from the rural east who came to Warsaw to work on the building sites. Andrzej is 41, a successful and wealthy tax consultant employing 20 people and advising &quot;high-value clients&quot;. His 13-year-old son is privately educated and has all the latest gadgets and toys. Despite his success, Andrzej is less than satisfied. &quot;We&apos;re the lucky generation. From my perspective, things look good,&quot; he says. &quot;But there&apos;s not too much positive in what has happened. The whole history of privatisation has been an exercise in robbery. The old system was a nightmare, but this is not a democracy.&quot; The grumbling is echoed in opinion polls across the region. A survey of Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, and Hungarians last week from Warsaw&apos;s Institute of Public Affairs found a solid majority, except among the eternally gloomy Hungarians, satisfied with the &quot;transformation&quot; of the past two decades, but a sizeable minority frustrated. While between 53% and 68% of Slovaks, Poles and Czechs believed life had improved, 65% of Hungarians thought things were no better or worse. &quot;It&apos;s surprising how many are not so enthusiastic about democracy,&quot; said Malgorzata Falkowska-Warska, a researcher at the institute. The social scientists also conducted a focus group of young people and were even more surprised to find a strong degree of cynicism about the drama of the past two decades. &quot;We were shocked that the young were very ambivalent about the advantages of freedom and democracy. We expected them to be much more idealistic,&quot; says Falkowska-Warska. One of the big benefits of the relatively new-found liberties, repeatedly mentioned, has been the freedom to travel. But the wanderlust, paradoxically, is also one of the most disturbing factors. The freedom to travel has prompted the most extraordinary exodus of modern times. Since Poland joined the EU in 2004, some 2.3 million young Poles have left, not all at the same time, some coming and going, but with the vast majority staying away. They are overwhelmingly from the depressed small towns and villages of eastern and southern Poland. As soon as they could, they voted with their feet. Most have not returned and are putting down roots in Britain, Ireland, Sweden, Germany and elsewhere. Analysts have been shocked by its scale. &quot;No one expected the emigration to be so huge because there&apos;s no need to escape from this country any more. They weren&apos;t persecuted. They left a free country,&quot; says Krystyna Iglicka, one of Poland&apos;s leading demographers. Statistics show that around one in five of the post-1989 generation in the active and productive age group of 21-35 have moved abroad. &quot;This might be a win-win situation for the UK and Ireland, filling the needs of the low-skilled labour market but it is not for us,&quot; Iglicka adds. &quot;We thought the migration would be circular, people coming back \u2026 I call this a lost generation.&quot; Andrzej, the wealthy tax adviser, is angry at the exodus. &quot;These young people feel that going to the UK is the biggest achievement they can imagine. But that&apos;s not success. Why don&apos;t they stay and do something in Poland?&quot; He is also anxious that being part of a united Europe is not necessarily good. &quot;The EU influences the style of life here, promoting certain values such as homosexuality that are not natural in Poland.&quot; Luke Pelletier shrugs at such prejudice. &quot;I love Warsaw, it&apos;s a very, very easy place to live,&quot; says the Parisian gay man who has lived in Poland for 14 years and is happy with the decent living he makes as a drag queen. Pelletier is in a civil partnership with Trevor, a black South African who grew up in London. Despite Poland&apos;s occasional reputation for homophobia, neither have any big complaints. Marta, the young businesswoman, says she would not dream of living anywhere but Warsaw. When the wall came down and the world opened up, Marta, her mother, Monika, and her grandmother, Tereza, went to Canada to visit relatives. It was their first trip to the west. &quot;It was amazing, so thrilling. They had everything in Canada we didn&apos;t have. If I could have stayed, I would have,&quot; says Monika. It is one fundamental measure of the changes that such notions now seem bizarre. She has been back and forth to Canada ever since and two months ago the 48-year-old remarried. Her new husband is a Canadian who is giving up his job to move to Warsaw. &quot;Now I wouldn&apos;t like to live in Canada,&quot; says Monika. &quot;Every time I go there, I don&apos;t even think about it.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday 10 November.

Thai officials were angered by the announcement last week that Thaksin Shinawatra would advise the Cambodian government and prime minister. The former Thai prime minister was sentenced in his absence to two years&apos; jail last year after he allowed his wife to buy state land at a discount price. Thaksin was ousted as prime minister in 2006 in a military coup and has since been living in self-imposed exile. He flew into Cambodia on Monday, prompting Thailand to request yesterday that he be arrested and returned to Thailand to serve his prison sentence. Cambodia rejected the request, saying Thailand&apos;s legal case against Thaksin was politically motivated. Today Cambodian foreign ministry spokesman Koy Kuong said the first secretary of the Thai embassy had been given 48 hours to leave the country for carrying out activities inconsistent with his official duties. He refused to say what the activities were. Thailand responded by ordering out the first secretary of Cambodia&apos;s mission in Bangkok, Kuong said. After Thaksin&apos;s new role was announced on 5 November Thailand recalled its ambassador in Cambodia and said it would review all agreements between the two countries. Critics, including Thailand&apos;s current government, have portrayed Thaksin as a traitor for accepting the Cambodian appointment and attacked Cambodia for hosting a fugitive. But in a speech today the former Manchester City football club owner insisted both countries would gain from his acumen. &quot;A prosperous neighbour means better opportunities for us to grow together,&quot; he said. &quot;Of course, not all my compatriots see it that way right now. Their domestic political compulsions force them to false patriotism. Let&apos;s pray that they too will one day appreciate this partnership for progress.&quot; The two countries have skirmished over their border recently and as the conflict over Thaksin has escalated, Thailand has torn up an agreement over maritime boundaries. The row has heightened fears that the violent dispute over the Preah Vihear temple on the shared border could flare up again. Thaksin won two landslide election victories before he was ousted in a military coup, and is still hugely popular in Thailand, particularly among the rural poor in the north. His supporters claim the political elite is ignoring the fact he was democratically elected because it feels its own privileges are threatened. The former leader provided critics with more ammunition on Tuesday in a newspaper interview which allegedly criticised the Thai royal family.

A few unfortunate financial mishaps have left him just as affected by the recession as many others before him. And just like those people, Cage knows there&apos;s only one way to get out of this pickle \u2013 to sell off several homes worth a total of almost $95m, as well as his private Bahamian island. We&apos;ve all been there. But if that doesn&apos;t balance things out for him, Cage can always work himself out of his mess, either by making films at a greater frequency or by forgetting about quality and agreeing to star in bad films purely for money. The obvious hitch is that Cage has already been in nine films since 2007, including Knowing, Next and G-Force, a cartoon about some violent guinea pigs. Luckily, though, we&apos;re in a position to help. All of us. If everyone reading this blogpost pitches in a couple of quid, we&apos;ll probably end up with enough money to make our very own Cage film. It&apos;s a win-win: Cage gets a much-needed payday and we get our very own cut-price, boggle-eyed, Oscar-winning actor. So what can we make him star in? I&apos;ve boiled our choices down to three. A remake Cage is the remake king. The Wicker Man was a work of demented majesty, Bad Lieutenant has generated his best reviews for years, and his upcoming live-action version of The Sorcerer&apos;s Apprentice will no doubt be everything anybody ever wanted from a film about Cage wearing a funny hat and dancing around with a magical mop. So what beloved film could use the Cage treatment? What about a new version of Casablanca, updated so that Rick Blaine is a jellybean-popping Karen Carpenter obsessive who spends his nights riding around on a motorbike solving crimes with his head on fire? Or West Side Story, where Cage plays all the characters \u2013 male and female \u2013 by himself? Or a reboot of The Birds, which is essentially the &quot;Not the bees!&quot; sequence from The Wicker Man stretched out for two hours with the word &quot;bees&quot; replaced by the word &quot;birds&quot;? A sequel With National Treasure 2 and the forthcoming Ghost Rider 2, Cage has noticeably softened his stance towards sequels, allowing us the perfect opportunity to bring back some of his most beloved characters for a second whirl around the block. But which one should we go for? Face/Off 2 would be good, and you have to admit there&apos;s something eminently watchable about a movie called Bangkok Dangerouser. But why make those when you could make a sequel to Cage&apos;s 1991 masterpiece Zandalee keeping all of the good bits from the original (Cage&apos;s elongated country-dancing sequence with Judge Reinhold; Cage punching a painting, covering himself in black paint and then telling an easel to F-off) and leaving out the rubbish (everything else)?

His career as a ranting, rightwing politician and radio commentator spanned four decades, during which time he held eight cabinet positions, including two stints as interior minister. During the second of these, in May 1992, the military premier General Suchinda Kraprayoon ordered troops to open fire on a pro-democracy rally in the heart of Bangkok. Dozens of activists were killed. Samak justified the bloodbath with the notion that &quot;the killing of communists&quot; was acceptable. No public investigation into the incident has ever taken place, nor has there been any attempt to establish accountability. Most Thai television and radio stations are in the hands of either the military or the government, and the facts about Samak&apos;s involvement in some of Thailand&apos;s darkest episodes were far less familiar to voters than his appearances on Tasting and Ranting, the popular cookery programme that made him a household name, mixing gastronomic tips with political diatribes. Born in Bangkok, Samak came from an aristocratic family and gained a degree in law. He first entered politics in the 1960s and became an MP in 1975. In spite of his upbringing, he appealed to the poor and uneducated, using crude and vitriolic language that earned him the nickname &quot;dog-mouth&quot;. This populism helped him to get elected as governor of Bangkok in 2000. But to most political pundits, it always seemed unthinkable that a man so well known for his abrasive comments and contempt for human rights and democracy could ever become prime minister. But in 2007, the deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra was banned from Thai politics and sentenced in absentia to a two-year jail term for corruption, and thus the veteran Samak was handed a new lease of political life. From his base in Dubai, the exiled billionaire tycoon Thaksin was able to pull strings with political parties loyal to him. He offered Samak the leadership of his rebranded PPP (People Power party) shortly before the election campaign kicked off. The Thaksinite party won, and the unthinkable came to pass. In January 2008, Samak, as Thaksin&apos;s proxy, became Thailand&apos;s 25th prime minister. Soon afterwards, in an interview with CNN, Samak provoked outrage in his attempts to justify his role in a massacre in 1976, when he had been deputy interior minister. Rightwing gangs and police under his ministry had stormed Thammasat University in Bangkok, on a mission to kill so-called communists. Many students were lynched on the spot. Others were burned alive, shot or raped. Officially, 46 were killed and 3,000 arrested. The new prime minister told CNN that &quot;there was no massacre that day, only one unlucky guy being beaten and burned in Sanam Luang [a Bangkok park]&quot;. A Bangkok Post editorial lambasted Samak for his lack of regret and his abject denial that these crimes had even taken place. Massacres carried out by the military junta of Thailand&apos;s neighbour, Burma, were passed off by the prime minister as &quot;normal&quot;. In August, protesters stormed Samak&apos;s compound, locked him out and demanded his resignation. He declared a state of emergency, but the army leadership, being anti-Thaksin, declined to intervene. Samak&apos;s attempts to win back the support of the army by cooking chicken curry for troops serving on the Cambodian border failed. But his downfall came about not because of political incompetence, nor his imbecilic comments, but, paradoxically, as a result of what he was good at \u2013 his cookery programmes. In September 2008, Thailand&apos;s supreme court ruled that the prime minister&apos;s appearances on television and his acceptance of payment for them was a clear case of conflict of interest, and therefore in violation of the constitution. He was obliged to step down. Late last year, Samak sought treatment for liver cancer in the US. He\u00a0had kept a low profile since returning to Thailand. He is survived by his wife, Khunying Surat, a financial adviser, and\u00a0their two children. \u2022 Samak Sundaravej, chef and politician, born 13 June 1935; died 24 November 2009", "publicationDate": "2009-11-25T18:54:31Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Television", "Television & radio", "Politics", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/25/samak-sundaravej-obituary", "title": "Samak Sundaravej obituary", "sentences": ["During the second of these, in May 1992, the military premier General Suchinda Kraprayoon ordered troops to open fire on a pro-democracy rally in the heart of Bangkok.", "Born in Bangkok, Samak came from an aristocratic family and gained a degree in law.", "This populism helped him to get elected as governor of Bangkok in 2000.", "Rightwing gangs and police under his ministry had stormed Thammasat University in Bangkok, on a mission to kill so-called communists.", "The new prime minister told CNN that &quot;there was no massacre that day, only one unlucky guy being beaten and burned in Sanam Luang [a Bangkok park]&quot;.", "A Bangkok Post editorial lambasted Samak for his lack of regret and his abject denial that these crimes had even taken place."]}, {"article": "Thailand&apos;s former prime minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh recently ignited a furore when he proposed that the separatist campaign in his country&apos;s Muslim-majority southern provinces might be solved politically, with a form of self-rule. Thailand&apos;s ruling Democrat party immediately called Chavalit&apos;s remarks &quot;traitorous&quot;. But recent developments surrounding Afghanistan&apos;s elections have highlighted the shortcomings of using military force alone to resolve a civil war. This precedent offers an important lesson for Thailand and other countries facing intractable insurgencies. As Aristotle put it, &quot;politics is the master science in the realm of action&quot;. In June 2006, I sat in a village in southern Thailand&apos;s Yala province with several ordinary-looking young men who had taken part in extraordinary events. They had joined the militants who had attacked a dozen security checkpoints across three southern provinces on 28 April, 2004. Armed mainly with machetes and kitchen knives, 106 attackers perished that day, 32 of them inside Pattani&apos;s historic Krue-Se mosque, where they had taken refuge. Five members of the Thai security forces were also killed. None of the youths I talked to could give any clear explanation for their actions, except to say that an Islamic schoolteacher known as Ustadz So had recruited them into a shadowy militant movement. Ustadz had taught them that Thai rule over this historically Malay region was illegitimate, that Thai officials were cruel and heartless, and that the time had come for the Muslim population to rise up and expel the Buddhist infidels. According to counter-insurgency expert David Kilcullen, the violence in Thailand&apos;s deep south \u2013 which has now claimed more than 3,500 lives \u2013 was some of the most intense in the world between 2004 and 2007, &quot;second only to Iraq and Afghanistan during this period.&quot; Yet, despite such alarming levels of bloodshed, the insurgency has been under-reported and under-researched, barely registering on the international community&apos;s radar screen, largely because the conflict cannot be reduced to a sound-bite-friendly narrative of identifiable bad guys and good guys. First, the militant movement itself has no name, operating in a highly decentralised manner through small local cells that operate relatively independently \u2013 what might be described as self-managed violence franchises. Thai political expert Chaiwat Satha-Anand has called the movement a &quot;network without a core&quot;. The lack of a defined enemy makes reporting on and understanding the conflict difficult for journalists, diplomats, and government officials. Second, outcomes are not predictable. On 28 April, 2004 the insurgents&apos; primary targets were Buddhist members of the security forces, but most of those who died were Malay Muslims. The would-be perpetrators also became the primary victims. Some victims have been killed extra-judicially. The one group not targeted by anyone has been westerners. Again, reporting such a messy story is a challenge; most western news editors have preferred to highlight Iraq and Afghanistan. A third factor is that the violence has become a marginal issue even within Thailand. The breaking news teams returned to Bangkok long ago, where a military coup, ongoing mass protests, and other big political stories have kept them busy ever since. And, because the violence tends to come in dribs and drabs \u2013 rarely since 2004 has any one day&apos;s casualties reached double figures \u2013 the south has never risen back up the news agenda. Many Thai military and police officials now privately admit that the insurgency cannot be defeated through security measures. After a dip in the number of incidents during late 2007 and 2008, violence once again increased in 2009. The military&apos;s belief that Malay Muslims could be re-educated and re-socialised into accepting a Thai identity has proved untenable. The same goes for earlier hardline rhetoric about rooting out the militants and destroying their organisation. The current government under prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva misses the point with rhetoric about creating peace simply through promoting justice, or by funding large-scale socio-economic development projects. Malay Muslims in Thailand&apos;s southern provinces are demanding their own political space. Few of them seriously believe that a tiny separate Patani state, wedged between Thailand and Malaysia, would be viable. What many are seeking is some form of special status within Thailand, enabling them to pursue their own cultural and religious traditions without interference from Bangkok. Until the Thai government grasps this simple point, young men like those I met in Yala will still be recruited into militant activity. As Chavalit understands, the southern Thai conflict is a political problem in need of a political solution \u2013 just like Afghanistan and other more familiar wars. \u2022 Duncan McCargo is professor of south-east Asian politics at the University of Leeds and author of Tearing Apart the Land: Islam and Legitimacy in Southern Thailand, which won the 2009 Asia Society Bernard Schwartz book award \u2022 Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2009.", "publicationDate": "2009-12-01T20:30:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/dec/01/thailand-malay-muslims", "title": "Blood flows in Thailand's deep south | Duncan McCargo", "sentences": ["The breaking news teams returned to Bangkok long ago, where a military coup, ongoing mass protests, and other big political stories have kept them busy ever since.", "What many are seeking is some form of special status within Thailand, enabling them to pursue their own cultural and religious traditions without interference from Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Sandra Gregory, the British woman sentenced to 25 years&apos; imprisonment in Thailand for drug smuggling, has been deported after trying to re-enter the country.

The actor, who first appeared on the show 35 years ago, died at the Salford Royal Hospital on Wednesday. She had been forced to pull out of filming on the ITV1 soap in October after being admitted to hospital for major surgery. Jones had appeared to be making a good recovery, but her condition deteriorated on Wednesday and she died peacefully in her sleep. She had won several comedy awards for playing Blanche since 1974, although she only became a regular cast member in 1999. Her performances became famous for barbed one-liners. Telling Liz off for leaving her washing drying all over the sitting room, Blanche said: &quot;Kenneth doesn&apos;t want to stare at thongs all day. The man&apos;s an intellectual!&quot; To Deirdre, she said: &quot;You need to learn to enjoy other people&apos;s misfortune, otherwise you&apos;re going to have a very unhappy old age.&quot; After Ken got down on one knee to propose to Deirdre and she turned him down: &quot;Well, if you leave it much longer he won&apos;t be able to get up again!&quot; To Deirdre: &quot;Good looks are a curse. You and Ken should count yourselves lucky.&quot; On Liz McDonald: &quot;Skirt no bigger than a belt, too much eye liner, and roots as dark as her soul!&quot; William Roache, who plays Ken Barlow, described Jones as a &quot;brilliant actress&quot;.

Crook Memorial Hall working committee held the event on 14 November to help raise money for the village hall and sold an old-fashioned cream-coloured dresser with mirrors, which had been temporarily left in the building after being used in artwork pictures for a local band. Alison Park, the secretary of the committee, said: &quot;We assumed someone had brought it in and left it for our rummage sale and we sold it. We don&apos;t know who he was. He was tall, dark and handsome with a wife and two children.&quot; Gary Trimington, a member of the band, said the dresser had been lent to them by a friend and had sentimental value. He explained that they couldn&apos;t fit it into their van and left it to one side and collect it the next evening. &quot;Unknown to us, there was a rummage sale and, when we came back, to our horror the table was gone,&quot; he said. &quot;We are desperate to track down this gentleman with the hope that we could buy back the dressing table and offer him a reward for any of his troubles.&quot; ______________________________________________________ Exciting news from Liverpool: The Wire actor Dominic West will be coming to the city in the new year to direct an episode of Jimmy McGovern&apos;s daytime drama Moving On.

Robert Winthrop, 37, was being held at the prison after admitting possessing cocaine and amphetamine with intent to supply. Prison staff insisted he walk free on bail even though he told them he had been remanded in custody. Lawyers are waiting to see whether he turns up for sentencing at Newcastle crown court on 9 December. At a hearing into Winthrop&apos;s case, Judge Beatrice Bolton demanded an inquiry into the mistake. She said: &quot;It is quite extraordinary. There would have been a remand document, yet the prison have released him with no explanation and no apology to the court.&quot; After being released, Winthrop, from Hebburn, South Tyneside, rang his lawyers to tell them he was at large. Prosecutors have not made an application for an arrest warrant to return him back to custody. Katherine Dunn, defending, said: &quot;Hopefully he will hand himself in. If he doesn&apos;t, a warrant could then be issued.&quot; A Prison Service spokeswoman said an investigation into what had happened was under way. Last year, 23-year-old Terence Clegg went on the run for nearly two weeks after staff at Durham prison released him instead of his 51-year-old father, also called Terence.

It has city accommodation from \u00a311 per night, and can arrange an eight-day trip to northern Thailand&apos;s hill tribe villages for under \u00a3300pp. The company has Delhi flights for \u00a3249pp return in early February, and a &quot;Roam India&quot; 20-day tour (through Gap Adventures) for \u00a3599. Africa&quot;Gambia and Kenya tend to be good-value winter sun destinations,&quot; says Sam Baldwin, travel features editor of skyscanner.net, a flight deals website. For example, Monarch has flights to Banjul from Gatwick, from 5-12 January, for \u00a3205 return. For Kenya, flights to Mombassa can cost up to \u00a3800, but flying from the middle to the end of January will find the best bargains, says Kathryn Frengs of Travel Fusion , which also collates deals and has flights from London on 24-27 January for around \u00a3523 return. Dealchecker.co.uk has two weeks in Kenya for only \u00a3499pp, departing from Manchester on 13 December, including B&amp;B hotel accommodation set back from a white beach near Mombassa. Chris McIntyre, managing director of Expert Africa says: &quot;Last year, the recession hit dollar-based countries particularly hard, especially Tanzania, Zambia and Botswana. They&apos;ve had a tough 2009, so they&apos;re all coming out with quite sensible prices, and rolling out the special offers they implemented this year in the rand-based countries \u2013 South Africa and Namibia \u2013 which were great value, although the rand has now got stronger again. In 2010, some very top-end properties have come down quite a lot. December-March is the rainy season in most of Africa, but it&apos;s a bit different in Tanzania, when there is a short dry period in January and February. At the top end, our Elephant Fly-in Safari (six nights), at the top-rated Beho-Beho camp, costs \u00a32,766pp (inc all flights, transfers, meals, park fees and activities), as opposed to \u00a33,584 last year.&quot; Europe and North AfricaThe best bargains are the Canaries and Egypt, which offer &quot;exceptional value&quot;, says Sam Baldwin of Skyscanner.net. &quot;And Tunisia&apos;s Mediterranean coastline is emerging as a good winter sun destination, yet is not overrun with tourists. You can fly Gatwick to Tunis for around \u00a3134 during January-March, when the weather is warm and sunny.&quot; EasyJet&apos;s flights start at \u00a375.88pp return for flights from Gatwick to Tenerife in the first week of January. Teletextholidays.co.uk has got trips to the Red Sea in December from \u00a3108pp inc flights and hotel B&amp;B.

Flights with Swiss International Air Lines from Heathrow to Cairo, are around \u00a3307.70 return for those dates. City breaks closer to home can also offer good seasonal value, and you may be lucky with the weather if you go mid-haul. Kayak.co.uk&apos;s deals section has flights from London to Athens, for example, from 23-27 December for \u00a3142 with easyJet, and has three star hotels from \u00a385 a night. The Caribbean This may also be a good option this year if value for money is what&apos;s important to you. &quot;Holiday offers are usually unheard of in peak season [our winter], but as a result of the current financial climate we have got some amazing savings at our top-selling hotels,&quot; says Paul Cleary, managing director of Caribtours. Among the company&apos;s current offers to luxury hotels are a \u00a3770pp saving on the super posh Blue Waters in Antiguapp, now costing \u00a31,775 pp all inclusive, including flights. It also has \u00a3880pp off the Colony Club in Barbados \u2013 a week costs \u00a31,785pp. Use packages as a jump off Often the cheapest way to reach a far-flung spot is to bag a last-minute package to a touristy destination. While you may grimace at the accommodation included, a tacky deal can be worth booking for the flight price, to use as a jumping off point for a stay somewhere more interesting. This works well for Goa. A week costs \u00a3229pp with Monarch Holidays, departing Manchester on 11 December for seven nights at the Baga Hotel, including return flights and seven nights&apos; B&amp;B. Monarch&apos;s flight-only for the same route and dates is \u00a3260pp, and flying with Jet Airways costs \u00a3957.60pp return on those dates \u2013 its cheapest winter flights are around \u00a3550 in January. Baga is rather overdeveloped, but you could head down the coast to lovely Majorda, backpacker favourite Palolem or up to hippyish Arambol where there are lots of funky beach shacks and boutique hotels (see i-escape.com). Be savvy about dates   Some of the best bargains are on or around Christmas day. Flights with British Airways over Christmas from London to Mexico City cost \u00a3720 one way inc taxes if you fly on 23, 25 or 28 December, but \u00a32,486 on the 21 December.

There are also some general rules to bear in mind. &quot;All the best flight deals on long-haul, such as the Caribbean and the Maldives are for Sunday departures, but closer to home, in Europe, Monday tends to be the cheapest,&quot; says Alex Saint, managing director of dealchecker.co.uk. For all winter sun destinations, the first two weeks of December (ie now!) and mid-January are normally cheapest, said Sam Baldwin of Skyscanner. And certain weeks of the year tend to work out cheaper for specific destinations, says Kathryn Frengs of Travel Fusion. &quot;Direct flights from London to Cancun in March and April can cost more than \u00a3800, but a trip in the last week of January (22-29) is currently only \u00a3457 return on ThomsonFly.&quot; \u2022 Deals available and prices valid at time of going to press.", "publicationDate": "2009-12-05T00:05:19Z", "tags": ["Winter sun", "Late offers", "Budget travel", "Travel", "Caribbean holidays", "India holidays", "Mexico holidays", "Mexico City holidays", "Egypt holidays", "Thailand holidays", "Bangkok holidays", "The Gambia holidays", "Kenya holidays", "Delhi holidays", "Tanzania holidays", "Tunis holidays", "Athens holidays", "Greece holidays"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/dec/05/winter-sun-savings", "title": "Winter sun on a budget", "sentences": ["Where to go Asia &quot;Over the winter months, the best-value destinations in Asia are Bangkok, and Delhi,&quot; says Ian Swain of STA Travel.", "&quot;Bangkok continues to offer the lowest flight prices in south-east Asia, with many carriers flying regularly from the UK, and you can reach Thailand&apos;s beaches or jungle relatively cheaply by public transport.&quot; STA&apos;s London-Bangkok fares start at \u00a3335pp return in Jan/Feb."]}, {"article": "The 80p Michelin starA humble dim sum canteen on a Hong Kong back street has become the world&apos;s cheapest Michelin-starred restaurant.

Over eight months, their epic journey covered 16 nations and terrain ranging from mountain glacier and icecap to flood plain and forest. I caught up with them in Thailand, where the fishing village of Khun Samut was fighting a\u00a0losing battle against the elements. Like many stops on their journey, the location was stunningly beautiful, the inhabitants extremely poor and the impact of climate change less straightforward than they&apos;d originally been led to believe. The wetland teemed with wildlife, but a sudden rise in temperature had decimated fishing catches. More dramatically, coastal erosion was speeding up and residents had been forced to move repeatedly \u2013 some more than 10 times in 40 years. The local Buddhist temple was on the frontline. &quot;The core of our work is building barriers against the sea,&quot; the abbot, Somnuk Atipanyo, said as he surveyed the dwindling line of mangroves that had previously provided a natural defence. &quot;Without this we couldn&apos;t survive.&quot; We learned Bangkok was considering a similar strategy on a far bigger scale. The National Disaster Warning Administration has proposed the construction of a 80km-long sea wall at a cost of $3bn. Without such countermeasures, it said the Thai capital could be submerged in 20 years. But determining the extent to which these problems were caused by climate change was difficult. Intensifying storms and the accelerated rise in the sea level were compounding the\u00a0effects of more direct human activity. In Bangkok, subsidence was caused mainly by the growth of skyscraper construction. In Khun Samut, erosion was accelerating because upriver dams prevented silt from reaching the estuary, thereby depriving the mangroves of soil. That night, we were woken by a thunderstorm that shook the stilts of our hut. The next morning, as we said goodbye to our hosts, I wondered how long it would be before they have to move again. While rising sea levels pose a long-term threat, a more pressing impact of climate change is the increase in extreme weather events. For some of Braschler and Fischer&apos;s subjects, such as the Italian farmers who lost part of their crops to freak hailstorms, this was a costly inconvenience. For the more vulnerable, it could cause crippling poverty or death. In China, we visited Anguli Lake in northern Hebei province, which was marked as a large blue\u00a0splodge on the map but which proved to be a\u00a0barren salt flat. Namuhua, a Mongolian woman who lived nearby, showed us where the fishing and pleasure boats had been moored 10 years earlier. Nothing was left but a couple of propellers buried in sand. A dearth of rain and ill-conceived dams had killed a lake that once spanned more than 20km. Unable to grow crops, lacking enough grass to feed their cattle and frequently beset by &quot;white dragon&quot; salt storms, half the community had moved away. In Siberia, scientists in the city of Yakutsk appeared divided on global warming. Since the 1960s, temperatures there have risen by more than 2C \u2013 one of the fastest rates on the planet. Reports suggest the permafrost on which the city is built is melting. Yet at the Permafrost Research Institute, Mikhail Grigoriev speculated that rising temperatures were part of a natural climatic cycle that had little impact on the 70m-thick layer of subterranean ice. Elsewhere, however, there were signs of subsidence in cracked roads and alarmingly buckled buildings. Vladimir Vasiliev, an ecologist at the Northern Forum Academy, said\u00a0meltwater floods were becoming more frequent. The day before we left Siberia, I visited Lena River beach, where swimmers splashed and built sand castles. With temperatures nudging 35C, the planet&apos;s deep freeze looked more like a sunbathers&apos; paradise. The number of people in the US who believe the planet is warming has in the last two years fallen from 77% to 57%, according to a recent survey. Braschler says this level of denial shows how far removed many urbanites have become from communities who still live close to the land, such as the Inuvialuit hunters of northern Canada or the traditional farmers in Chad. &quot;These people share an ability that most people in western societies have lost: they are able to observe changes in nature,&quot; he said. &quot;They are like the canary in the coal mine. Their observations are early warning signs and should be taken seriously. Soon these changes will affect all of our lives. Global warming is a real threat. And we should do something about it.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2009-12-12T00:07:52Z", "tags": ["Climate change", "China", "World news", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Copenhagen climate change conference 2009", "Global climate talks", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/12/climate-change-braschler-fischer", "title": "Climate change: Turning up the heat", "sentences": ["&quot;Without this we couldn&apos;t survive.&quot; We learned Bangkok was considering a similar strategy on a far bigger scale.", "In Bangkok, subsidence was caused mainly by the growth of skyscraper construction."]}, {"article": "Back in the early 1980s Jimmy Savile fronted a series of TV ads with the tag line, &quot;This is the age of the train&quot;. Frankly, it wasn&apos;t. At the time the railways were haemorrhaging passengers, while motorways were multiplying and accessible air travel was no longer an impossible dream. Nobody wanted slam-door rattle-bang any more. Fast forward nearly three decades and the situation has changed. Motorways are nose-to-tail and airports have lost their glamour. But trains have gone on doing their own thing. Yes, we&apos;ve got wonderful new high-speed services in Europe, but there are also hill-climbing antiques, trans-continental empire builders and retro-style sleepers, still plugging away. That diversity is refreshing in an increasingly homogenised world, but railway travel does share key characteristics. It is a stress-free, uncluttered way of seeing a place, with the chance to meet its population en route. With that in mind, here is my (very subjective) list of the world&apos;s top five journeys. 1. The Trans-Siberian Express This is a rite of passage. Eight days from Moscow to Vladivostok on a huge train that becomes a travelling community. The Trans-Sib is the ultimate meet-the-people experience, with lifelong friendships forged over vodka shots. Seven time zones (though the train, like all trains in Russia, runs on Moscow time), 5,000 miles of track and one shower for the whole train. Find timetables on poezda.net. Or do the journey in comfort on private trains such as the Golden Eagle ( gwtravel.co.uk). Great Rail Journeys (01904 521900; greatrail.com) offers a 17-day tour leaving London on 4 February from \u00a37,995 by rail or from \u00a37,295 with a flight to Moscow. 2. The Caledonian Sleeper This smog-to-bog sleeper is the Tardis of UK rail. Known as the Deerstalker, it runs overnight from London Euston to Fort William, leaving the 21st century and travelling back in time. The cabins are functional and the ride is clanky, but you wouldn&apos;t want to sleep late and miss the scenery&apos;s virtuoso performance outside your window after dawn. Scotrail (0845 601 5929; scotrail.co.uk) offers second-class two-bed sleeper advance tickets from \u00a359 one way, or any time tickets for \u00a3100 one way. 3. The Venice-Simplon Orient Express I know this is a pricey way of getting to Venice, but the authenticity and the glamour of this private train is unbeatable. The Venice-Simplon Orient Express (VSOE) is a slice of history, and grand-daddy to a new generation of luxury train journeys. Arguably the world&apos;s most famous train, and certainly Europe&apos;s longest, it unzips Europe from top to bottom in a substantial journey of more than 1,000 miles that lasts 31 hours. Its carriages are the real deal, most dating back to the 20s and 30s, and have been lovingly restored. A one-way journey on the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, from London to Venice, costs \u00a31,595. This includes all meals (but not alcoholic drinks) and accommodation. To book visit orient-express.com or call 0845 077 2222. 4. The Bernina Express The Swiss are unbeatable at the trains-up-mountains business, and this daily service that tootles over the Alps from Chur, the country&apos;s oldest town, to Tirano in Italy may look like a toy, but runs on metre-gauge track that has been designated a Unesco World Heritage site for its engineering. One of the slowest expresses in Europe, it is bright red, is gleamingly clean and boasts panoramic windows, giving you staggering views as it takes the highest railway crossing over the Alps. A one-way ticket from Chur-Tirano costs CHF57 (\u00a335.63), plus a CHF9 (\u00a35) seat reservation fee. For timetables, see rhb.ch. 5. The Nakorn Ping Express Tour operators will try to push train-interested travellers in the direction of the lavish Eastern &amp; Oriental Express, the south-east Asian equivalent of the VSOE, but Thai Railways&apos; eccentric daily sleeper does the 700km trip from Bangkok in the south to Chiang Mai on the River Ping for a fraction of the price. It is a real slice of local life, and runs six times a day through some of the region&apos;s finest landscapes. The food on board is gastronomically exotic but served in polythene bags, and the dawn scenery around Lampang is all rainforest, mountains and hill tribes. A second-class berth on the last train, Number 51, which departs from Bangkok at 10pm, costs from 531 baht, or a bit less than \u00a310.

Authorities in Bangkok said today it was unclear where the plane carrying the 35-tonnes of arms, an Ilyushin IL-76 registered in Georgia, was heading. But suspicion immediately fell on Iran, the destination of a previous illegal weapons shipment impounded in the United Arab Emirates in July. Panitan Wattanayagorn, a Thai government spokesman, said the plane had initially planned to refuel in Sri Lanka. For unknown reasons, the crew asked to make an emergency landing in Bangkok on Friday. Sri Lanka denied any knowledge of the arms shipment. There was also speculation in Bangkok that it was destined for Pakistan or Afghanistan. Thai officials, who detained four crewmen from Kazakhstan and one from Belarus, said they acted on tip-offs from US and other unnamed intelligence agencies that the plane was carrying North Korean-made weapons in contravention of a UN security council ban on arms exports. The ban was strengthened in June, after North Korea&apos;s isolated regime test-fired ballistic missiles and detonated a nuclear bomb. The cargo, declared in the plane&apos;s manifest as oil-drilling equipment, was said to include rocket-propelled grenades, missile and rocket launchers, missile tubes, surface-to-air missile launchers, spare parts and other heavy weapons. North Korea is estimated to make about $1bn a year from arms sales, despite the UN ban imposed in 2006. Sanctions were further tightened by last summer&apos;s UN security council resolution 1874, which gave UN members the right to inspect North Korean cargoes at sea or in port. But a UN investigation into the sanctions reported last month that North Korea had built or augmented clandestine smuggling networks. Pyongyang&apos;s top priority was to finance continuing work on its nuclear weapons programme. The report said that illegal arms sales &quot;have increasingly become one of the country&apos;s principal sources for obtaining foreign exchange&quot;. It described how North Korea used reputable shipping lines, the mislabelling of goods, subsidiary companies and circuitous routes to shield its smuggling activities from view. The Bangkok arms seizure followed several similar recent incidents. In July, the French-owned, Bahamian-flagged ANL Australia bound for Iran was intercepted in the UAE after a US tip-off. The ship was found to be carrying containers of small arms made in North Korea, military hardware and sufficient explosive powder to arm thousands of short-range rockets. Also uncovered was a cache of 2,030 detonators for 122mm rockets and other rocket components. The manifest also detailed the cargo as oil drilling supplies. Investigators said the arms shipment had travelled a complicated roundabout route. Ten large containers left the North Korean port of Nampo on 30 May aboard a North Korean vessel, and were transferred three days later to a Chinese ship at the Chinese port of Dalian. They then went on to Shanghai, where they were loaded on to the ANL Australia, turning up in the Gulf two months later. US officials said the ANL Australia was one of five vessels caught this year carrying large consignments of weapons apparently intended for Iran&apos;s militia clients such as Hezbollah and Hamas, or for the al-Quds brigade of Iran&apos;s Revolutionary Guard that protects Iran&apos;s nuclear facilities and supports insurgents in Iraq. In three cases, the US said the arms included North Korean or Chinese-made weapons. No evidence has been produced in public to support US claims of Iranian involvement in North Korean arms smuggling networks. Iran has consistently denied supplying arms to Hamas and Hezbollah although it openly supports the two groups. Washington has long suspected Iran and North Korea of co-operating on nuclear and ballistic missile development. North Korea also secretly assisted Pakistan&apos;s nuclear weapons programme. In another incident, US navy vessels tracked a North Korean ship, the Kang Nam, which was spotted in June, apparently en route to Burma, allegedly with illegal arms on board. The ship eventually turned around and headed home, thereby avoiding a search. North Korea says it would regard any direct interception of its ships as an act of war.", "publicationDate": "2009-12-13T17:36:31Z", "tags": ["North Korea", "Arms trade", "Thailand", "Nuclear weapons", "Iran", "World news", "United Nations", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/13/north-korea-arms-smuggling-plane", "title": "North Korean plane carrying smuggled arms seized in Thailand", "sentences": ["Authorities in Bangkok said today it was unclear where the plane carrying the 35-tonnes of arms, an Ilyushin IL-76 registered in Georgia, was heading.", "For unknown reasons, the crew asked to make an emergency landing in Bangkok on Friday.", "There was also speculation in Bangkok that it was destined for Pakistan or Afghanistan.", "The Bangkok arms seizure followed several similar recent incidents."]}, {"article": "The intended destination of a plane carrying 35 tonnes of arms from North Korea and impounded in Thailand was tonightstill unclear, with none of the governments apparently linked to the seized flight admitting any responsibility for its cargo. Ukraine today said it had launched an investigation into the Ilyushin-76 aircraft, amid speculation that it may have been transporting arms to Iran as part of a North Korean smuggling network used to fund North Korea&apos;s banned nuclear weapons programme. Ukrainian sources indicated the plane had originally set off from Belarus. Belarus&apos;s foreign ministry denied the report, but confirmed that one of its citizens \u2013 Mikhail Petukov \u2013 had been on board, working as a flight engineer. According to Ukrainian officials, the plane travelled via Ukrainian airspace and refuelled at an airport near Kiev. It set off again on 8 December without a cargo to North Korea. The plane picked up a shipment of portable grenade launchers, an anti-aircraft missile system and other weapons from Pyongyang, North Korea&apos;s capital. Thai officers seized the aircraft on Saturday at Bangkok&apos;s Don Muang airport, acting on tip-offs from US and other intelligence agencies that the plane had been carrying North Korean weapons in contravention of a UN security council ban on arms exports. Today Bangkok&apos;s criminal court extended the detention of the plane&apos;s five-man crew, four of whom come from Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan tonight denied any knowledge of the illegal arms shipment. It said the plane was registered in Georgia on 7 October and had been leased to a New Zealand company. The crew has been charged with possession of heavy weapons and misstating the nature of the cargo, officially described as &quot;oil-drilling equipment&quot;. Crew members claim they had no idea they were carrying weapons. &quot;They thought it was a civilian freight flight carrying oil drilling pipes and other equipment for oil drilling,&quot; defence lawyer Somsak Saithong said, according to Reuters. Saithong said the crew had delivered such equipment &quot;a few times&quot; in the past, adding that three of the crew were trained pilots. According to military sources, the cargo also included missile tubes, spare parts and other heavy weaponry. Experts are now examining the contents at a secluded military airport. Today, government spokesman Panitan Wattanayagorn said the aircraft was supposed to be flying to the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo. But he said the authorities were investigating whether the flight plan was misleading, and the final destination was in the Middle East, noting the aircraft had recently stopped in the United Arab Emirates. &quot;We believe after Colombo there may have been another destination,&quot; he said, adding that, according to the crew, the plane had planned to refuel in the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan before flying to its &quot;final destination&quot; in the Ukraine. &quot;We are taking all of this with a pinch of salt. We will have to verify all the claims, including whether the passports are real,&quot; Panitan said, adding police still had little information about who the crew members were, where they have been trained and whether they were linked to a terrorist organisation. North Korea was hit in June with fresh UN sanctions to punish it for a nuclear test in May. These are aimed at cutting off its arms sales, which earn the isolated and impoverished state more than $1bn a year. The North&apos;s biggest arms sales come from ballistic missiles, with Iran and other Middle Eastern states major customers, US government officials suggest.", "publicationDate": "2009-12-14T17:28:00Z", "tags": ["Arms trade", "Thailand", "Ukraine", "Belarus", "Kazakhstan", "Iran", "North Korea", "World news", "Europe", "Asia Pacific", "South and Central Asia"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/14/thailand-impounds-plane-arms-korea", "title": "Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan disavow arms flight from North Korea", "sentences": ["Thai officers seized the aircraft on Saturday at Bangkok&apos;s Don Muang airport, acting on tip-offs from US and other intelligence agencies that the plane had been carrying North Korean weapons in contravention of a UN security council ban on arms exports.", "Today Bangkok&apos;s criminal court extended the detention of the plane&apos;s five-man crew, four of whom come from Kazakhstan."]}, {"article": "It&apos;s up to the bosses now. Years of international gatherings \u2013 from Bali to Bangkok to Bonn. Nine raucous, angry and confusing days cooped up in the windowless halls of Copenhagen&apos;s biggest conference site. The protesters in polar bear suits. The countless appeals for action \u2013 and the forecasts of the life-altering consequences of global warming if world leaders fail to come to a firm deal. It all comes down to the next 36 hours. As more than 115 world leaders descend on Copenhagen to make the crucial decisions, what can we expect? Nobody really knows. By 6pm last night, negotiators had produced a text so dense and unwieldy that the Danish prime minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, called in negotiators from the larger countries to help knock it into &quot;laymen&apos;s terms for politicians&quot;. If they succeed, the main issues looming for leaders on Friday will be as follows. Kyoto Protocol: Should it stay or go? At the heart of the Kyoto protocol is the simple principle that the industrialised world bears the legal responsibility for global warming and that poor countries will suffer most of its consequences. But this vision has translated into a bitter divide between rich and poor countries. The industrialised world \u2013 led by Japan and the EU \u2013 wants to ditch Kyoto, arguing that the 1997 protocol does not reflect current realities because it ignores the now huge emissions from emerging economies such as China, India, Indonesia and Brazil. Also, the US never even signed Kyoto. But many African countries and other poorer countries are fighting hard to retain Kyoto, accusing the industrialised world of trying to escape their responsibilities. Emissions cuts: How do they stack up?  Much of the work in getting commitments to cuts in greenhouse gas emissions was done before Copenhagen. Some have been impressive. Japan pledged a 25% cut in emissions. Brazil committed itself to a drastic reduction in deforestation. Other pledges, though significant gestures, did not go as far. China and India both signed up to a less polluting course of growth, but balked at putting a ceiling on emissions within the next few years. America satisfied a minimum requirement of coming to Copenhagen with a defined pledge to cut emissions, but it was a lowball offer. It was also conditional on getting climate change law through the Senate, which could be a struggle. There is expectation that the European Union could deepen its reductions to 30%, which would set off a chain reaction of increased offers. But while analysts say that the emissions cuts are more than they expected, they are still not enough to guarantee keep warming under the danger level of 2C. Deadline for a treaty The Copenhagen summit was originally supposed to be the deal to end all deals on global warming. But negotiators conceded this year that there was no chance of a legally binding deal. Instead, they wanted to use Copenhagen as a forum where world leaders could thrash out a &quot;politically binding&quot; agreement, leaving the details for lawyers to iron out later. But that two-step approach presents a new problem: if there is no treaty now, then when? The UN, Britain and others are pushing hard to set a six-month deadline, so as not to lose momentum. But the spectre of the moribund Doha round of trade talks haunts the minds of some. Transparency America has been pushing hard to establish an inspection regime to make sure developing countries deliver on their promises to reduce emissions and prevent deforestation. The issue is key because rapidly emerging countries such as China and Brazil are not required to cut emissions under the Kyoto agreement, but have agreed to do so anyway. The US pressure rose yesterday when John Kerry offered a stark choice: agree an inspection regime or risk the prospects of getting a crucial climate change law through the Senate. Climate finance Expect a last-minute flurry of cash. Developing countries \u2013 which did not cause global warming in the first place \u2013 have no incentive to sign a deal unless it helps them deal with its consequences. Barack Obama, Gordon Brown, Nicolas Sarkozy and other leaders have been personally engaged in efforts to try to put together a financial package for African countries. But compared with the billions of pounds that will be needed to help developing countries move to clean energy technology and shield them from the worst ravages of climate change, so far there is only small change on offer. The industrialised countries are on track to give an immediate injection of cash \u2013 $10bn (\u00a36.1bn) a year over three years from 2010. But coming up with a plan for more has so far drawn a blank. One plan from the Ethiopian prime minister, Meles Zenawi, sets out how developed countries could scale up their funding to $50bn by 2015 and $100bn by 2020. But other African countries have accused the Ethiopian leader of a sellout. Deforestation Between 15% and 20% of global warming pollution is caused by the razing of forests. The solution is to makes trees worth more alive than dead. That effort got a boost yesterday when Australia, France, Japan, Norway, Britain and America agreed to provide $3.5bn in immediate cash for forest preservation, with the promise of more later.

Browsing through the items on offer in the window, I spot a pair of jeans that I like the look of. The price tag says \u00a31.59. A licensed, authorised, branded pair of Diesel jeans for \u00a31.59. The only catch is that they&apos;re made of pixels, not denim, and they belong in a fictional universe that could be the future of advertising, social networking and gaming combined. Welcome to the weird and wonderful world of PlayStation Home. The concept of PlayStation Home is simple. It&apos;s a free-to-use, beautifully rendered, fictional universe in which anyone who owns a PlayStation 3 can reside. Once a user loads up their profile they are dropped into an apartment with a balcony that overlooks something resembling Monaco. In the town outside lie a communal square, a bowling alley, a pool hall and even a shopping mall in which to buy real estate or clothes. This brings us to the jeans. Inside the shopping mall lies a branch of the real-world clothing brand Diesel. In it, users can buy any number of pixelated replicas of Diesel&apos;s real-life ranges for real-life money. Diesel is by no means the last brand that will set up shop here, because PlayStation Home has just announced reaching 10 million users. Home isn&apos;t alone either, it&apos;s merely the latest in a long line of virtual reality (VR) worlds that are now springing up all over the internet. Is this all a waste of time? Conventional wisdom states that we should have better things to do with out lives than spending hard-earned pennies on pixelated pairs of jeans. Critics will argue that these worlds are populated by nerds, geeks and middle-aged recluses with all the social skills of a road accident. Perhaps years ago this was the case, but the popularity of VR environments has seen a staggering rise. World of Warcraft now has over 11 million subscribers worldwide. Second Life has an economy so large that their Linden dollar is tradeable currency in the real world to the tune of $29m per quarter. The games industry now generates more revenue than its cinema counterpart. It appears that, one by one, we&apos;re all becoming geeks. With so many people now taking part in these environments, it&apos;s just not possible that they are all losers. I&apos;ve dipped my toes into Second Life, Home and (briefly) World of Warcraft. While they didn&apos;t hold my attention for long, the people I met there were, by and large, friendly and interesting. Perhaps tellingly, most of them admitted that they kept their VR identity a secret in the real world for fear of mockery, so a VR enthusiast might be closer than you think. Admittedly, these worlds still have a long way to go. Anyone with a reasonably busy lifestyle probably can&apos;t spare the time to indulge in them and wouldn&apos;t see the point. This was my initial reaction, and the one that still holds me back from diving in to VR headfirst. But pause a second, and imagine the possibilities that VR might enable in the future. One day these experiences will be totally immersive. Sony already has a patent on (though are unlikely to be anywhere near developing) a device that replicates sensory interaction via a neural connection to the user&apos;s brain. Touch a granite surface in the VR world and it will feel like granite. Drink a glass of Coke and it will taste like Coke. In this kind of genuinely immersive, graphically photorealistic world, the possibilities are endless. Imagine constructing your own dream holiday to a perfectly rendered 1960s London, or ancient Rome. When you combine these capabilities with the attraction such worlds already have for brands and advertisers (imagine a living, breathing VR Paris with your company&apos;s banner hanging over the Eiffel tower), the horizon grows broader still. In addition, the scope for VR worlds goes beyond gaming. What is Home but a graphical manifestation of social networking? The same people who once scoffed at old-world networks such as Twitter, Facebook and MySpace, but now use those services daily, may one day warm to a VR version. Why Facebook a friend in Thailand when you can catch up in a virtual reality Bangkok? VR has come a long way, but it has not yet broken into true mass appeal. Worlds such as Home do, however, do show how far the technology has come. Personalised fantasy holidays, as popularised in films such as Total Recall, are closer than we think. With new worlds that are graphically comparable to the latest game releases, supported by advertising and almost unlimited in scope, the possibilities for virtual reality are endless.", "publicationDate": "2009-12-31T14:00:00Z", "tags": ["Virtual worlds", "Technology", "Second Life", "PlayStation", "World of Warcraft", "Business", "Technology sector", "Social networking", "Media", "MMORPG"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/dec/31/virtual-reality-worlds-commerce", "title": "Virtual reality is coming of age | Alexander Walters", "sentences": ["Why Facebook a friend in Thailand when you can catch up in a virtual reality Bangkok?"]}]}
