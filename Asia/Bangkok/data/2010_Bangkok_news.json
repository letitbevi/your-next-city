Milan remain eight points adrift of Internazionale after thumping Juventus 3-0 in Turin last night but they do still have a game in hand. Mayweather v Pacquiao, it ain&apos;t, but at least we shouldn&apos;t have to worry about either side pulling out of a scheduled bout at San Siro in two weeks&apos; time. &quot;Milan are the anti-Inter,&quot; declares the front page of Corriere dello Sport today, while Gazzetta proclaim it a &quot;Scudetto for two&quot;. The last time the Rossoneri won away to Juventus, in March 2004, they went on to take the title, though they were already top by five points at the time. A more tangible cause for optimism would be the fact Milan have now won seven of their past eight in Serie A. Inter have dropped seven points over the same stretch. Leonardo&apos;s side have given some sparkling performances during that run, the coach&apos;s attack-minded selections creating mismatches all over the pitch, but yesterday was not one of them. Despite the scoreline, the two sides managed just seven attempts on goal between them. Other than a solo effort from Diego that flashed wide of Nelson Dida&apos;s goal, the highlight of the first 25 minutes was the Milan midfielder Massimo Ambrosini heading Ignazio Abate&apos;s throw-in straight back out for a Juventus throw. Juventus might have drawn encouragement in that phase from the ease with which they had contained Milan by closing down space and putting pressure on the visitors&apos; midfield high up the pitch. But after losing five of their previous seven games in all competitions, confidence was always likely to be fragile. Few can have been surprised when Felipe Melo, suffering more than most of late, failed to deal with a poor corner at the near post, allowing the ball to run across for Alessandro Nesta to jab home at the far post. More disconcerting than the goal itself was Juventus&apos;s lack of response. With David Trezeguet having picked up an ankle injury against Parma last week it was left to Amauri to lead the line ahead of Diego, but neither managed a single shot on target. In the end, the centre-back Giorgio Chiellini, who within the first seven minutes of the second half twice forced Nelson Dida into saves \u2013 albeit not especially challenging ones \u2013 proved the Old Lady&apos;s greatest attacking threat. The reaction of the home support to such a miserable showing was to call early and often for the introduction of Alessandro Del Piero, but he was similarly ineffective after replacing Hasan Salihamidzic in the 60th minute. By the time Del Piero forced Dida to tip a free-kick around the post in injury time, Milan had already extended their lead to three through a pair of goals from Ronaldinho. By then, of course, Juventus&apos; fans had found other ways to express themselves \u2013 groups of Ultras setting off bangers and smoke bombs as well as starting small fires in the stands, while others chanted against Mario Balotelli, or in support of their disgraced former director Luciano Moggi. For the most part these were songs that had been heard before at Turin&apos;s Stadio Olimpico, but then a new chorus began. For the first time all season, Juventus&apos;s fans openly began to appeal for the sacking of the manager Ciro Ferrara. &quot;I sincerely think my job is not at risk,&quot; Ferrara told Sky Italia afterwards, though his manner in a later interview with Controcampo suggested he may be feeling the strain more than he would like to admit. &quot;I see in the studio there is already the new manager,&quot; said Ferrara on noting that Luigi Maifredi, a former coach who had a brief stint with Juventus from 1990-91 and who has been publicly critical of him in recent days, was among the show&apos;s studio guests. A brief back and forth ensued as the pair took turns telling each other to &quot;shut up&quot; before Ferrara sarcastically asked Maifredi, who left his last managerial post in 2001, whom he was coaching at the moment. The case against Ferrara has been outlined in this blog before, but yesterday&apos;s defeat only served to highlight the same flaws. Tactically, the coach has failed to establish a system that gets the best out of the expensively acquired Melo and Diego and he does not seem to possess a gift for motivating his squad. The charge against Claudio Ranieri when he was sacked last season was that he had lost the dressing room, but Ferrara never really had control in the first place. He has had some tough luck with injuries \u2013 Gianluigi Buffon, Vincenzo Iaquinta, Mauro Camoranesi, Momo Sissoko (still not fit but now with Mali for the Africa Cup of Nations), Sebastian Giovinco, Trezeguet and the suspended Mart\u00edn C\u00e1ceres were all unavailable yesterday \u2013 and the decision to send Lorenzo Ariaudo, Tiago Mendes and Cristian Molinaro out on loan this week has left the squad particularly thin. But there is still plenty of talent there. The Old Lady&apos;s track record \u2013 before last season at least \u2013 of not sacking managers during a season had stood in his favour, as had the fact the fans were still on his side, but now that the mood has turned it seems likely his days are numbered. The Turin-based Tuttosport&apos;s front-page headline this morning simply reads: &quot;Hiddink now!&quot; &quot;Juventus has arrived at the end of the line and the &apos;all alight here&apos; announcement applies to everyone, starting with the driver,&quot; writes Vittorio Oreggia in an accompanying editorial. &quot;There is no more time, we cannot wait for another resurrection as bogus as the Rolexes sold on market stalls in Bangkok. In this team even Leo Messi would look like a fool and Cristiano Ronaldo would struggle to express himself.&quot; Unfortunately for Ferrara, his critics seem to have no such trouble. Talking points \u2022 The champs, of course, won again, though it was hardly plain sailing against Siena. Inter were 1-0 down, then 2-1 up, then 3-2 down with just over two minutes of regular time to go at San Siro before eventually winning 4-3. Siena were livid afterwards at the award of the free-kick from which Wesley Sneijder made it 3-3 (a blisteringly brilliant free-kick from a good 30 yards out, incidentally), and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho took his opposite number Alberto Malesani into his office after the game to talk things over before either spoke to the press. &quot;Malesani said our third goal came from a non-existent foul and I gave him my word I&apos;d look at the footage and tell him if it was,&quot; said Mourinho. &quot;I&apos;ve seen it now, it is a foul you can give 30 metres away from the goal.&quot; Malesani disagreed, however, and so did his players. &quot;It is always the same old story, the big clubs that walk all over the little ones,&quot; said the Siena defender Cristiano Del Grosso afterwards. &quot;I would love one day to come to San Siro and win after dominating the match, but it&apos;s not possible. At the end of the day, they will always win.&quot; \u2022 The Atalanta president Alessandro Ruggeri said he &quot;already has a replacement in mind&quot; after sacking Antonio Conte on Thursday, but is apparently in no rush. Caretaker Valter Bonacina was on the bench yesterday as they lost 1-0 at Palermo. \u2022 Napoli remain fourth, but are now level on points with Juventus after a 1-0 win over manager Walter Mazzarri&apos;s former club Sampdoria. The loss of Ezequiel Lavezzi to a thigh strain will hurt them, however, and with Roma just a point behind after they beat Chievo 1-0, and both Fiorentina and Palermo coming on strong behind them, the race for the Champions League places could be a really interesting one. \u2022 Lazio picked up another useful point with a 1-1 draw at Udinese, but the headlines have been dominated this week by the coach Davide Ballardini&apos;s falling out with Mauro Z\u00e1rate. Ballardini accused the player of being too selfish after Wednesday&apos;s 4-1 win over Livorno, but the player&apos;s brother and agent Sergio responded furiously, demanding an apology and saying if one was not forthcoming that the club would need to choose between Z\u00e1rate or Ballardini. The club chose Ballardini. &quot;We need to stamp out individualists in football,&quot; said the club president Claudio Lotito over the weekend. &quot;Ballardini is right and he did very well to say those things.&quot; \u2022 It&apos;s hard to know where to start with the goings-on at Torino over the past week, but here&apos;s a brief digest. On Thursday the Italian FA&apos;s disciplinary commission began an investigation into allegations of suspicious betting on a game between Torino and Crotone in November, which the Granata lost 2-1. Then on the same day several members of the team were physically attacked, in front of their families in several cases, by a group of hooligans at a dinner being held to celebrate David Di Michele&apos;s birthday. There was talk of the team going on strike, and when that didn&apos;t happen, reports emerged of several leading players, including Di Michele, demanding transfers away from the club. On Saturday the team then lost 2-0 away to Cittadella, and then yesterday the team reappointed Stefano Colantuono, who was sacked right after the aforementioned defeat to Crotone, as manager. Quite a week, then. Results: Bologna 0-1 Cagliari, Fiorentina 2-1 Bari, Genoa 2-0 Catania, Inter 4-3 Siena, Juventus 0-3 Milan, Livorno 2-1 Parma, Napoli 1-0 Sampdoria, Palermo 1-0 Atalanta, Roma 1-0 Chievo, Udinese 1-1 Lazio.

We&apos;ve looked at players injured during masochistic celebrations before, so although we&apos;ve had many an email showing us the latest scorer crocked while attempting a triple somersault backflip cartwheel, we&apos;ve only discoverd a couple of players injured while properly showboating. Predictably Kerlon isn&apos;t the only South American to fall victim in this manner, as Paulo Padilha explains. &quot;This happened in the final of the Campeonato Paulista,&quot; he writes. &quot;Corinthians had a two-goal advantage over Palmeiras from the first game, and the rivalry between the clubs was at the highest it had been in a long time, with Palmeiras having just knocked Corinthians out of the Copa Libertadores and players exchanging provocations all week. &quot;Corinthians went ahead in the first half, but Palmeiras got two goals in quick succession. The game was tense until the 75th minute, when Corinthians tied it through Edilson, after a great play by Ricardinho. As the Corinthians fans cheered, considering the final practically over, Edilson chose to celebrate a little by juggling the ball near the halfway line. Some of the Palmeiras players were not amused, and they continued to kick him even after they got the ball off him. A brawl ensued, the referee ended the match, and Corinthians lifted the 1999 Paulista Championship trophy.&quot; Morten Rasmussen&apos;s injury falls into the category of players pratting about rather than actually showboating, but it&apos;s an interesting little tale nevertheless. &quot;In August 2006 Brondby and Silkeborg was playing each other, but the game was cancelled due to heavy rain,&quot; writes Jens Lange. &quot;The players decided to fool around on the watersoaked pitch; sliding as far as they could, splashing water, jumping the the pools, etc. Morten &apos;Duncan&apos; Rasmussen hurt his ligament during a slide and was out for a some weeks. He did not really get going because of the injury untill 2007.&quot; And if we stretch the definition further to off-pitch showboating, we can include the diminutive full-back (and, slightly bizarrely, occasional central defender while at Sheffield United) Alan Wright. While at Aston Villa Wright needed treatment for a knee strain caused by the position of the accelerator in his new Ferrari, and if owning a new Ferrari isn&apos;t showboating we&apos;d like to know what is. Wright quickly recovered and ditched his flash motor for a Rover 416. YOUR GROUND&apos;S TOO BIG FOR YOU ... (2) Last week we looked at the clubs with stadiums bigger than their local population, with the previously unheralded FC Gera Drnovice (population 2,300, capacity 7,000) initially crowned the champion, with their ground able to accomodate 304% of the townfolk. As ever, though, we&apos;ve had several suggestions this week that can comfortably top the club from the Czech Republic: 357% &quot;German team SC Weismain-Obermain (population 4,760) play in their games in the Kreisklasse Coburg 2 League in the 17,000 capacity Waldstadion,&quot; writes Danny Last of the excellent European Football Weekends blog. &quot;Room for everybody in town and seat for both your Bratwurst and your beer each.&quot; 600% &quot;The Czech stadium is nowhere near to the real winner,&quot; writes Dr Andr\u00e1s Gelencs\u00e9r confidently. &quot;Akaszt\u00f3 is a village in B\u00e1cs-Kiskun county of Hungary with a population of around 3,500. It used to be the home of Stadler FC (who played in the First Division between 1995 and 1998) and possessed a stadium that seated 21,000 people (actually, there were 22,000 spectators against Ferencv\u00e1ros in their first top-flight season). The club itself was the creation of a former shepherd, J\u00f3zsef Stadler \u2013 a self made millionaire who dreamed about building a stadium in his hometown, in the middle of nowhere. He named the club and the stadium after himself. When ready it was the most modern stadium in Hungary. Later he was involved in a criminal case (tax fraud) and served few years in prison whilst his team was relegated and later disappeared. Now the stadium is empty and near collapsing.&quot; Loads more on Stadler FC can be found here (if you can read Hungarian). 966% &quot;Mj\u00e4llby AIF is a club which has just been promoted to the top flight in Sweden,&quot; writes Jonas Lagerstedt. &quot;They come from a small town of H\u00e4llevik, which boasts an impressive 776 inhabitants (in 2005 according to Swedish bureau of statistics), and their stadium Strandvallen has a capacity of 7,500.&quot; 1157% Frustratingly for Jonas and, yes, the entire population of Sweden, in a reversal of the 1814 war (possibly), Norway can just beat their Scandinavian neighbours in this contest. &quot;Nybergsund IL set a new club attendance record of 3,750 spectators recently,&quot; writes Dag R\u00f8nningen. &quot;As of 1 January 2009 Nybergsund had a population of 324.&quot; And finally a couple of corrections. Clones is slightly bigger than we suggested. Well, OK, nearly three times bigger, with a population of around 3,000 rather than 300. And Roderick Stewart writes to point out that Blakes Estate Stadium probably didn&apos;t have a capacity of 4,000. And from this picture it does look a little optimistic. THE BIG FREEZE &quot;I read that Rotherham haven&apos;t played a game since 12 December,&quot; began Jeremy Fitch last week. &quot;What is the longest period a team hasn&apos;t played a competitive game within a football season?&quot; Indeed the Millers had not played for 38 days until they faced Darlington last night (who had also been inactive for the same period), though they were well short of matching the troubles suffered in the winter of 1962-63. &quot;The answer is Bolton according to &apos;The trivia lover&apos;s guide to football stories and facts&apos; that I picked up in the Boots January sale for a couple of quid,&quot; writes Joe Rowsell. &quot;The book states that &apos;Bolton Wanderers sufferred the longest period in league history without playing a match. After their 1-0 win over Spurs on 8 December 1962, they were unable to take to the field again until 16 February 1963, when they lost 3-2 to Arsenal.&apos;&quot; In that same year Rangers also went two months without playing. &quot;An Old Firm victory is always enjoyable but Rangers fans had a particular opportunity to relish their 4-0 win over Celtic on 1 January 1963, &quot; writes George Taylor. &quot;Severe weather meant Rangers did not play another game until 9 March when they won 2-1 at Dunfermline.&quot; AND A LITTLE BONUS ... &quot;Apart of course from this year, when was the last time both Liverpool and Man Utd went out of the FA Cup in the third round in the same season?&quot; wonders Allastair McGillivray. You have to go all the way back to 1958-59, when Manchester United were knocked out by Norwich City and Liverpool were stunned by Worcester City. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE Back in 2004 our initial attempts to find the world&apos;s longest team name led us to NAC Breda and the 86 characters which form their name. However, a week later we found a new champion:. &quot;I&apos;d like to nominate my team, UCD, in the League of Ireland Premier Division,&quot; says Kevin Burke. &quot;Under some universities&apos; act a few years ago, we officially became University College Dublin, National University of Ireland Dublin, Association Football Club (81 letters). There are some who&apos;ll suggest that, with that hideous new crest, it should now (unofficially) be University College Dublin Dublin, National University of Ireland Dublin, Association Football Club (87 letters). This would translate into Irish as Cumann Sacair Ollscoil na h\u00c9ireann Baile \u00c1tha Cliath Baile \u00c1tha Cliath, Ollscoil N\u00e1isi\u00fanta na h\u00c9ireann Baile \u00c1tha Cliath, which is 102 letters and a comma.&quot; Not bad, Kevin, but a rival school of learning trumps it. &quot;I think you&apos;d have to go some to beat the full name in Thai of Bangkok University FC,&quot; claims Liam O&apos;Brien. &quot;This would include the longest place name in the world, using the official Thai name for Bangkok. When translated into English, it would run to 189 characters as follows: Samosorn Maha Vittiyalai Krungthep Mahanakorn Boworn Rattanakosin Mahintara Yutthaya Mahadilok Phop Noparat Rajathani Burirom Udom Rajaniwet Mahasatharn Amorn Phimarn Avatarn Sathit Sakkatattiya Vishnukarm Prasit.&quot; But there&apos;s an even longer name in the very same city! That of Thai Pro League side Bangkok Bravo. &quot;Should they ever wish to refer to themselves by their full (English translated) name,&quot; notes Dale Farrington, &quot;they would be called: Krung Thep Mahanakhon Amon Rattanakosin Mahinthara Ayuthaya Mahadilok Phop Noppharat Ratchathani Burirom Udomratchaniwet Mahasathan Amon Piman Awatan Sathit Sakkathattiya Witsanukam Prasit Bravo Association Football Club (196 characters).

Can you help? &quot;What is the shortest time between home and away league games against the same opponent in league football? Can anyone beat Arsenal&apos;s games against Bolton from this year?&quot; asks Anton Marks. &quot;On 18 January 2010, Jari Litmanen played for Finland against South Korea.

A Thai national was charged with trafficking today after a 17-month investigation, involving the first collaboration between US and Thai law enforcement authorities. Earlier this week, Thailand&apos;s nature crime police also raided ivory shops, seized tusks and arrested two other dealers in the crackdown. Conservation groups said Samart Chokechoyma was the first suspected trafficker to be arrested in south-east Asia, which has become a hub of the illegal trade that led to the seizure last year of 10 tonnes of African elephant ivory. Far greater quantities of smuggled ivory go undetected. The contraband is poached from reserves in Kenya and Uganda, shipped out of Entebbe, taken to Thailand for processing and re-sale, then sold to buyers in the US, China, the Middle East and elsewhere. Chokechoyma was arrested in Bangkok in November, and could now be prosecuted in two countries: in Thailand, he faces a maximum of four years in prison if convicted. In the US, the combined jail term for all his counts of smuggling could rise to 53 years. The two other dealers who were arrested had been caught with six tusks, weighing a total of 32kg, from endangered African elephants. The value of the haul was estimated at US$30,222 (\u00a318,560). Sources close to the operation said this was likely to be a fraction of the overall trade and the kingpins were still to be found. Undercover customs investigators tracked the suspects by following the source of ivory products sold in the United States back to Asia with support from regional and independent conservation groups. The first fruits of collaboration were hailed as an important step forward in international efforts to coordinate a crackdown on the trade, which is eating into elephant herds. The next step was to target the leaders of the smuggling chain. Brad Coulter, the investigation operations officer of Freeland \u2013 one of the participating groups - said that, despite the arrests, the trade had now become so lucrative that elephant stocks were under attack. A kilogram of ivory now fetches US$700 in the markets of Thailand. &quot;Ivory smuggling is on the increase despite counter poaching operations and stiffer penalties,&quot; said Coulter. &quot;This is not about trade bans. It&apos;s all about money.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-01-20T16:57:34Z", "tags": ["Conservation", "Wildlife", "Environment", "Thailand", "Animals", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Illegal wildlife trade"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jan/20/ivory-smuggling-ring-thailand", "title": "Thai ivory-smuggling ring broken up", "sentences": ["Chokechoyma was arrested in Bangkok in November, and could now be prosecuted in two countries: in Thailand, he faces a maximum of four years in prison if convicted."]}, {"article": "   Peter Fraenkel    Peter Fraenkel, who has died aged 94, was a civil engineer at the heart of a movement of British consulting engineers responsible for infrastructure all over the rapidly developing post-colonial world of the 1970s and 80s. He built up a 160-strong practice that produced innovative, heavy engineering solutions to such problems as how to support the world&apos;s then longest cable-stayed bridge in Thailand and how to build the biggest road projects at that time through the challenging topography of Hong Kong. In the UK, he quickly made a name for\u00a0himself by carrying out research that led to the regeneration of Britain&apos;s stricken canal network. Fraenkel was asked to put together teams to walk along some of the country&apos;s 3,100km of canals to research the feasibility of bringing them back into commercial use. Many had fallen into dereliction and only through the efforts of enthusiasts had the occasional pumping house or lock been restored. The Fraenkel report (1975) argued persuasively that there was a case for restoring much of the network, aided by\u00a0central government funding. This report, for the Department of the Environment, was a catalyst for some early projects, such as the restoration of\u00a039 locks on the Kennet and Avon canal and the restoration of the Avoncliff aqueduct, which Peter Fraenkel and Partners (PFP) carried out. By the turn of the millennium, he was able to look back with pride at his role in the UK-wide regeneration of the 18th- and 19th-century waterways. Fraenkel was born in Breslau, Germany, now Wroclaw in Poland. His German parents \u2013 his father was Jewish, though Peter was brought up as a Lutheran \u2013 horrified at the rise of nazism, sent Peter to London aged 16. He rapidly learned English and won a place to study civil engineering at Imperial College. When the second world war broke out, Fraenkel was assigned to the Ministry of Works to supervise the building of brigade camps needed for soldier training. After the war he joined the consulting engineers Rendel Palmer and Tritton, specialising in heavy marine engineering projects. His most notable job was the Port Talbot harbour in south Wales. The presentation of this project at the Institution of Civil Engineers led to his being awarded the Telford medal, the most prestigious in its field. He took the bold step of setting up his own consultancy in 1972. It grew rapidly, winning projects all over the world, and received the Queen&apos;s award for enterprise in 1982. Projects in the UK included the loading jetties at the Sullom Voe oil terminal in Shetland, completed in 1978, and the floodgates to protect the entrances to the Royal docks and Tilbury docks, east of London, which were threatened by the rise in the water level after the completion of the Thames barrier in 1982. Overseas, Fraenkel opened an office in Nigeria in 1976 and worked on 600km of highways, including the 200km highway from Biu to Maiduguri, in the north of the country, which required clever solutions to ensure that the road and bridge structures resisted flash flooding in the rainy reason from the Ngadda river. He opened another short-lived office in Cameroon and lost a lot of\u00a0money due to the misappropriation of funds. Chastened, but with important lessons learned, Fraenkel moved into the next decade by\u00a0turning his attention to the far east and south-east Asia. Notable projects included a dockyard built in a mangrove swamp for the Thai navy at Pom Prachul, near Bangkok, in\u00a01980; the Rama IX bridge in Bangkok, which \u2013 when it was completed in 1987 \u2013 was the longest cable-stayed bridge in\u00a0the world, with a main span of\u00a0450m; and a highway in Malaysia from Sandakan to Kinatanga, which aided economic development in the east of the country. In Hong Kong, PFP designed the Tolo highway (1985), built along land reclaimed from the sea from Shatin to Tai Po in the New Territories. Another Hong Kong triumph in the mid-1980s was the enlargement and realignment of\u00a0the congested King&apos;s Road. By the late 1980s, however, work overseas began to dry up, as foreign consultants from the US and elsewhere challenged the market-leading UK engineering consultants. Project funders, such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, had also begun to redeploy their support for developing economies away from infrastructure and into improving governance. Fraenkel kept the firm afloat by breaking into the UK highways sector, where there was a boom in bypass building. After winning the Bicester southern bypass, he opened an office in Leicester and undertook many other highways schemes in the east Midlands. When the\u00a0UK&apos;s road-building programme came\u00a0to a halt in the mid-1990s, Fraenkel, by then an octogenarian, refocused the firm back into the heavy marine engineering that had made its name. He\u00a0remained involved in the firm into his 90s, and was remembered by colleagues as a shrewd operator. He is survived by his wife of 62 years, Barbara, and by two daughters, Laura and Sarah. \u2022 Peter Fraenkel, civil engineer, born 5 July 1915; died 18 November 2009", "publicationDate": "2010-01-21T18:16:00Z", "tags": ["Engineering", "Technology", "Road transport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jan/21/peter-fraenkel-obituary", "title": "Peter Fraenkel obituary", "sentences": ["Notable projects included a dockyard built in a mangrove swamp for the Thai navy at Pom Prachul, near Bangkok, in\u00a01980; the Rama IX bridge in Bangkok, which \u2013 when it was completed in 1987 \u2013 was the longest cable-stayed bridge in\u00a0the world, with a main span of\u00a0450m; and a highway in Malaysia from Sandakan to Kinatanga, which aided economic development in the east of the country."]}, {"article": "It was 5am, pitch black, on a road in the middle of nowhere, and we were negotiating in Spanish with two armed men standing behind a locked gate. After travelling 12 hours by coach from Venezuela&apos;s capital, Caracas, we were beginning to doubt that we&apos;d arrived at our intended destination \u2013 a ranch in the vast grassy plains of Los Llanos \u2013 and regretting watching its rear lights disappear into the darkness. But finally, after much talk, checking\u00a0and re-checking the scrap of paper that was supposed to announce our arrival, the men unlocked the gates, stepped aside and said, &quot;Welcome to El Cedral.&quot; We collapsed on to our rucksacks in relief. It was Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado&apos;s epic photographs of the country&apos;s landmark mountain, Roraima, that had inspired us to spend three weeks touring Venezuela. As two women whose backpacking days were in the distant past, our simplest option would have been to book a guided tour. But these are expensive, and anyway, we didn&apos;t want to pass our limited time being chaperoned around the country with a group of fellow Brits \u2013 so we dusted down our backpacks with plans to book locally when we could. Even a dire warning issued by a photojournalist just weeks before we set off (&quot;Outside of Baghdad, Caracas is the most dangerous capital in the world&quot;) could not deter us. We knew Venezuela was not going to be a budget option but we were unaware of just how expensive it would be. &quot;Bring plenty of dollars,&quot; one Briton living there had advised us. We didn&apos;t, and paid dearly for it \u2013 if exchanged on the thriving black market (which most travellers do), you got twice as many bolivars for your dollar. And with inflation running at about 25%, our guidebook&apos;s pricing was hopelessly outdated; restaurant and hotel bills weren&apos;t that much cheaper than you&apos;d expect to pay in London. On top of that, this month&apos;s partial devaluation of the currency by President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez means prices could rise even further \u2013 although by bringing the official exchange rate into\u00a0line with the black market, tourists should get a better deal and won&apos;t need to take large quantities of cash dollars with them. We didn&apos;t need to worry about prices, though, after paying in advance for our three-day stay in Los Llanos, the great plains that cover a third of the country and stretch from the Andes all the way to the Orinoco river. We&apos;d come here for the wildlife, and as day broke on that first morning at El Cedral, a 130,000-acre cattle ranch, or hato, in Apure state, the wildlife appeared even sooner than we&apos;d anticipated. Hundreds of birds wheeled above our\u00a0heads, while others turned the grass into a carpet of many colours, the\u00a0scarlet ibis being the obvious star.     Photograph: Grainne Mooney    The 7km road from the gates to our cabin was littered with potholes. But these weren&apos;t the only objects our driver struggled to avoid. Capybara (the world&apos;s largest rodent that looks like a giant guinea pig) and their young ambled by, blissfully unaware of the word &quot;roadkill&quot;. And not 100ft from where we&apos;d be sleeping, a sign caught our eye. &quot;Danger: Crocodiles&quot; it read. Behind it, dozens of caiman dozed on the banks or idled in the water. &quot;Do Not Cross&quot; the sign helpfully added. Well, we knew not to, but did they? With so much wildlife up close, it seemed almost unnecessary to take the two daily &quot;safari&quot; trips that are included in the package. But how could we resist the promise of seeing giant anteaters, red howler monkeys, pink dolphins, pumas and jaguars? Plus our ever watchful guide, Rafael, was a walking ornithological guidebook, pointing out white-tailed kites, kingfishers, spoonbills, black vultures, whistling ducks, Orinoco geese, black skimmers, egrets, savannah hawks, tiger herons, hummingbirds, black ibis and burrowing owls, to name a fraction of the 340 bird species registered here. Two of the stars at El Cedral are the Orinoco crocodile and the anaconda. The crocodile, South America&apos;s largest predator, has been introduced as part of a conservation breeding plan. And the project seemed to be going well. A pair of eyes in the water, Rafael explained, belonged to a female keeping a motherly eye on her nearby nest. At more than 3m long, she made the caiman look like children&apos;s toys. The anaconda, a shy creature by contrast, was harder to locate. When one was eventually found, it was a\u00a0juvenile, but still impressive at almost 3m. With all the flora and fauna it&apos;s easy to forget that Los Llanos is actually cattle country. And watching El Cedral&apos;s cowboys, or llaneros, looking as if they&apos;d ridden straight off the set of a Sergio Leone film, it&apos;s obvious why the place is often compared to the United States&apos; wild west. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez&apos;s roots are in Los Llanos, and his influence is still felt here today. As part of government land reforms, many hatos are effectively being nationalised. The idea, it seems, is to make idle land productive; Venezuela, after all, is reported to import more than 70% of what it eats. El Cedral had been targeted not long before we arrived, and the feeling among the workers I spoke to was that\u00a0this was a good idea. That may be, but when you see huge tracts of land being ploughed up by tractor after tractor, it is hard to believe this unique ecosystem will be unaffected. We left El Cedral as we&apos;d arrived \u2013 in pitch black. At 4.30am we stood with Rafael by the gate and as headlights approached, he stepped out, waving his torch like a ground crewman guiding down an aeroplane. The bus stopped, and so began our longest journey \u2013 a 24-hour, three-coach trip to the opposite end of the country, to Canaima national park in the far south-east and magical mountain Roraima. Some words of warning about travelling by coach in Venezuela. On all overnight trips, the air conditioning will be turned up to full. This means it&apos;s freezing. An extra jumper will not suffice. On board, you&apos;ll be shown only the world&apos;s worst films. On occasions, the same film repeatedly. I can now recite almost word perfect every line from Nicolas Cage&apos;s Bangkok Dangerous. However, when you&apos;re wrapped up warm, they&apos;re pretty comfortable, too.     Photograph: Grainne Mooney    When we finally clapped eyes on Roraima \u2013 the towering 2,700m flat-topped mountain, or tepui, and inspiration for Conan Doyle&apos;s 1912 novel The Lost World \u2013 we began to doubt we&apos;d be able to do what we&apos;d been planning since booking our trip: climb it. &quot;You&apos;ll be fine,&quot; our guide, Elke, assured us. We weren&apos;t convinced. Six days are needed to make the trek (the super-fit can do it in five; the super-rich can take a helicopter), including two nights on top, and you have to use a certified guide and porters to carry your camping equipment and food. It took two days of fairly straightforward hiking to reach &quot;base camp&quot;. On the third day, we left the open grassland for hot, clammy rainforest and a gruelling, slippery, leg-shaking final ascent. With a surface area of 34 sq km (Roraima straddles three countries, Venezuela, Brazil and Guyana), we explored only a tiny portion of the summit, but saw enough of its alien landscape to find a geological surprise around every corner: giant black rocks balanced impossibly on top of each other, like cairns built by giants, crystal valleys, waterfalls, and &quot;jacuzzis&quot; \u2013 water-filled holes in the rock that make for an icy plunge bath. There is wildlife that exists only here, but not the dinosaurs of Conan Doyle&apos;s imagination. Small black frogs, which cannot hop, abound, as do black butterflies. And carnivorous plants struggle to survive in a place where heavy rainfall washes away most of the soil. Perched high up in our &quot;hotel&quot; \u2013\u00a0basically an overhang of rock under which we camped \u2013 we enjoyed a delicious three-course meal cooked by Elke on a one-ring camper stove, and finished with hot chocolate with a nip of rum. As we watched the sun set, and heard the haunting cry of the nocturnal oilbird in the dark, we felt, literally, on top of the world. We came back down to earth with a bump at Angel Falls. With a drop of 807m, it is the highest uninterrupted waterfall in the world, 16 times higher than Niagara. Set deep in rainforest in Canaima national park, until recently the falls were named after the American adventure pilot Jimmy Angel, who &quot;discovered&quot; them in 1937. Last year, Ch\u00e1vez renamed them Kerepakupai-Mer\u00fa, or &quot;waterfall of the deepest place&quot; in the indigenous P\u00e9mon language. &quot;One could say he was the first one to see it from a\u00a0plane,&quot; Ch\u00e1vez said of Angel, &quot;but how many millions of indigenous eyes saw it, and prayed to it? No one should refer to Angel Falls any more.&quot; Whatever its name, when we finally got to see it \u2013 it&apos;s accessible only by plane \u2013 this &quot;wonder of the world&quot; was little more than a trickle. We knew it was risky visiting in April, the start of the rainy season, but still we were disappointed. However, that night, as we settled into our hammocks in a rudimentary camp across the river, a tropical rainstorm broke. Awoken at 5am the next day for our return journey in a tiny six-seater, the falls had been transformed from a pathetic stream to a\u00a0thunderous, fabulous display.     Photograph: Alamy    With a packed agenda behind us, all we wanted from our last few days in Venezuela was to relax. And Puerto Colombia, a small port on the north coast in Henri Pittier national park \u2013 with its pretty colonial buildings and distinctly laid-back Caribbean feel \u2013 was just the place to do it. The town&apos;s main beach, Playa Grande, has a magnificent backdrop of mountains and rainforest, and was a cool place to spend a day; we also caught a lift with local fishermen to the nearby secluded beach of Playa Cepe, but the 40-minute rollercoaster ride over huge waves proved just a little too exhilarating. Backpacking Venezuela was exhausting, thrilling, taxing, fun. I just hope that the current financial situation doesn&apos;t make it an unaffordable, lost world for future travellers.

In the Thai capital to deliver a lecture to high-school students on the role of film in peace-building, Stone said: &quot;Hitler is a monster. There is no question. I have no empathy for Hitler at all. He was a crazy psychopath. &quot;But, like Frankenstein was a monster, there was a Dr Frankenstein. He is product of his era,&quot; he added.

How can we in America not learn from Germany in the 1930s?&quot; he asked.

Garrison accused Louisiana businessman Clay Shaw of having a central role in the assassination, but his theories were thrown out by a court in 1967. &quot;To this day, many key Americans in power are in total denial about this story,&quot; said Stone. &quot;It is a national fairy tale. &quot;It&apos;s an amazing story and I did it,&quot; he said of the film. &quot;I thought I would be respected for it, and I was lambasted in the establishment press.

Stir your noodles into the boiling stock and move them about a bit so they don&apos;t stick together. Cook according to the packet instructions. Shred your cabbage into 1cm strips, quarter your bok choi and snap up the broccoli spears. When the noodles have 1 minute to go, throw in the prepared greens to blanch them. Drain the whole lot in a colander, reserving a mugful of the cooking water. Tip your noodles, veg and the water back into the hot pan. Add your garlic, soy sauce, Szechuan pepper and chilli oil. Give it all a good mix with tongs and divide among 4 bowls. Sprinkle over the crunchy beef , finish with a scattering of spring onions and serve each dish with a lime quarter to squeeze over. PS You can buy good chilli oil, or you can make your own. Get a handful of mixed dried chillies (as many as you like), toast in the oven to bring out the flavour, whack them in a food processor with a bottle of groundnut oil and pour back into the bottle. This will keep in your cupboard for a year.

It takes something extraordinary and life-changing. Something like a divorce. You have lost your head; you are in a woeful place, emotionally ravaged, and you feel like there is no light. I remember this very moment years ago. I had to shake myself vigorously and say: &apos;Come on, Raymond! Be a man.&apos; And I threw the most exquisite party for myself, right there and then. &quot;My party was a joyous event. I laid the table with white candles, a stiff napkin, the finest silver and a bottle of red wine and cooked myself a five-course meal. Steak, salmon, a little tarte and wine, to celebrate. It shouldn&apos;t be so unusual to eat alone. Mankind associates it with a sad little moment deprived of elegance and joy. Yes, you may spend less time preparing a meal for yourself, but I see it as a convivial moment. &quot;I need to cook good food for myself. It&apos;s rare you&apos;ll see me eating from the plastic bag or the fridge. A low point for me would involve p\u00e2t\u00e9, three gerkins, thinly sliced toast and a glass of excellent wine. But I am strict about what I put in my mouth even if no one is watching. Eating alone doesn&apos;t have to be a nasty white-bread sandwich or something tinned \u2013 although I would not turn my nose up at an artisan cassoulet with a glass of wine. &quot;In my line of work eating alone is very rare, and yet sometimes I can avoid people all day. If I am alone, I have no routine except for this: eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper. No one else does it like this, so I have to snatch some privacy for such a day. I&apos;ll make myself poached eggs with black pudding and porridge with a variety of milk. Soya one day, rice milk the next. I am not a robot; I can change. Lunch will be an omelette, probably cold, a moment snatched in the midst of a pressure cooker of work. And dinner? Nothing. Just a glass of wine. As we all know, all food turns to fat as we lie in bed. &quot;Of course, I use proper cutlery. To use fingers would be absurd. But I never read. The table is a precious place, not one for books. As for newspapers? To read of the doom and gloom in the world while chewing your croissant, that will give you indigestion, non?&quot;www.manoir.com RAYMOND BLANC&apos;S SMOKED SALMON OMELETTE 3 medium free-range, fresh eggs 1 tsp each olive oil and butter30g smoked salmon, roughly chopped In a mixing bowl, gently beat the eggs together with a pinch of salt and pepper.

Pour in the egg mixture and cook for a few seconds, allow the omelette to set lightly before stirring the set part inwards, repeat this motion 5 times until the omelette has formed completely but is still soft and creamy in the centre. Add the pieces of salmon in the middle of the omelette and fold the sides towards the centre. Brush the omelette with butter and serve. THOMASINA MIERSRed cabbage poached in red wine, toast and Marmite &quot;I live next door to a market in west London, and when I&apos;m home alone I&apos;ll buy the things that look the most fun. If it&apos;s just you to worry about, you can go a bit mad. &quot;One of my favourite things at the moment is red cabbage poached in an old bottle of red wine with bacon and garlic. It&apos;s nutritious, can be stored in the fridge and reheated as and when I get hungry. I have it with soda bread \u2013 I always have lots of soda bread for topping with various things, along with a block of parmesan, olive oil, chutney, proper butter and root vegetables as fall-back options. That&apos;s my kind of food.

GIORGIO LOCATELLIKebabs, risotto, Butterscotch Green &amp; Black&apos;s chocolate &quot;I used to be mad for beans on toast when I got home from work. But at 1am it&apos;s not good for you, so now I just have chamomile tea. Lately my family has fallen in love with Green &amp; Black&apos;s butterscotch chocolate. I&apos;ll eat a whole bar and then replace it so they don&apos;t know. When my wife Plaxy and daughter Margarita are not around, I sometimes eat kebabs from the Lebanese places on Edgware Road. They&apos;re not like other kebabs. They are really shawarma, chicken or lamb, marinated and cooked, then served with tabbouleh and wrapped in a flat bread with yoghurt, garlic sauce and tomatoes. &quot;Recently I was at home alone, not feeling well, and I made myself a glorious parmesan risotto. The food of my grandma. Real comfort food \u2013 and then to be alone was luxurious.&quot; MICHEL ROUX SRFried foie gras or stir-fried lobster straight from the pan &quot;There is nothing sad about eating alone. I adore it. I&apos;ll usually start without a plan. Maybe I&apos;ll wander to the butcher in France and buy a piece of pork loin, which I&apos;ll eat with a bowl of vegetables roasted in garlic and thyme. I do love a big red meat stew, so I&apos;ll freeze it in portions and eat it bit by bit. Occasionally I&apos;ll make a batch of puff pastry, slice some apple, bake it in the oven and freeze the rest \u2013 an accidental apple turnover. &quot;I always eat sitting down \u2013 it&apos;s better for the digestion \u2013 but other than that my manners go out the window. I&apos;ll often eat straight out of the pot. I am wicked. I&apos;ll stir-fry lobster with vegetables and a wine glaze, but I&apos;ll crack the shells with my bare hands and toss them away. Or fry a lump of foie gras and serve it on a hot plate with salt and eat it with a fork and no napkin. &quot;I love pancakes with apricot jam. I break my own rule and eat standing up. Pour the batter into a hot pan, cook it, spread it with jam and then stuff it in my mouth while pouring more batter in. &quot;I drink wine with my meals as a celebration of my solitude. I never read with a meal \u2013 it distracts from the food, and I like to concentrate on the flavours. Most of my recipes come from experimenting alone. And the bottle of wine sitting opposite me is the best company I could ask for.&quot;Sauces by Michel Roux, published by Quadrille at \u00a314.99, is out now MICHEL&apos;S BAKED APPLE FOR ONE 1 large cooking apple with unpocked skinunsalted butter1 tbs apricot brandy Preheat the oven to about 180\u00b0C/Gas 4.

Bake in the oven for about 45 minutes or until it puffs out. Once cooked, pour over apricot brandy and serve with a large glass of dessert wine. GILES CORENYesterday&apos;s lamb bone, in front of the telly &quot;I love eating alone. I always do it standing up: outside a kebab shop with a doner; in my kitchen with a whole roasted chicken fresh out of the oven, picking the wings and legs off while the torso cools; in the garden with a piece of cheese on toast; in front of the telly with yesterday&apos;s lamb bone, dropping bits of fat on the carpet. Sitting down is for wimps. Likewise cutlery. Alone, it&apos;s fingers only. I revert to basic atavistic principles: tear it off the animal, burn it a bit, get it down your face, and get on with your life.&quot; Giles Coren is the restaurant critic of The Times.

I make it into a real event. I take my time, I lay the table, I pour myself a healthy-sized glass of wine and sit down with a good book. It might be pasta with homemade carbonara for one but it will be properly made and served. &quot;That said, I&apos;m still very good at cobbling meals together. When I&apos;m alone I set myself up in the kitchen with a load of chillis and do as the Thais do, using leftover staples like rice to make soup. If I am running around, I&apos;ll snack on a lump of good hard cheese, but I&apos;ll usually have just one big meal. &quot;I recently discovered breakfast. I&apos;m always happy to whip up blueberry pancakes or porridge and banana for my kids, but left to my own devices I&apos;ll make something that&apos;s so spicy none of my family would go near it.&quot; www.smithsofsmithfield.co.uk JOHN TORODE&apos;S LEFT-OVER THAI RICE SOUP 1 heaped tbs boiled rice400ml water6 shots fish saucehandful spring onions, sliced3 chillis, sliceda handful of bean sproutsa sprig of corianderseasoning and chilli to serve Boil everything together until hot.

Beale worked on paramecium for 25 years, making a range of fundamental discoveries, and in 1965 he established the Protozoan Genetics Unit in Edinburgh, so initiating research on the genetics of the malaria parasite plasmodium. After 1976 this work was his focus, and it continues in Edinburgh to the present day. Because of his role in this research, Beale subsequently became known as the founder of malaria genetics. The work led to several subsequent research projects focused on the discovery of the genes that determined resistance of malaria to drug treatment. Beale was born in Wandsworth, south-west London, into a middle-class family. He was the first member of his family to go to university, riding his bicycle 20 miles a day to Imperial College London, where he obtained a first-class honours degree in 1935. Jobs were difficult to come by, but he was taken on by the John Innes Institute, under JBS Haldane, the pioneering geneticist (and editor of the Daily Worker). Beale undertook a number of plant-genetics projects, working on the inheritance of flower colour in plants, and wrote one up for a PhD thesis awarded in 1938. Among his colleagues at John Innes was AC Faberg\u00e9, grandson of the Russian court jeweller: this inspired Beale to study Russian at night school. In 1941 he was called up, drafted into the Intelligence Corps and sent with the British mission to Archangel and Murmansk in northern Russia, to liaise with the Russian military. Geoffrey witnessed the bombing of Murmansk by the Luftwaffe in the summer of 1942. Subsequently, he was a member of the Allied Control Commission in Finland where he interacted with Russian officers working under General Andrei Zhdanov, the number three in the Soviet Union (after Stalin and Molotov). He always maintained that he did little in the war &quot;except learn Russian and try to prevent venereal disease in the troops&quot;. However, this was clearly untrue, as he was promoted to captain and appointed MBE in 1946. That year, he moved to the US, where genetics was in an exciting phase. He was offered a position at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. This was a great time and place for science, as many of the foundations of modern genetics were being laid there by Nobel laureates such as Salvador Luria and Barbara McLintock. At this time, the study of the genetics of micro-organisms was in its infancy and fundamental issues about how the observed properties of an organism are determined or inherited were still being questioned. Many scientists considered that the determinants were unconventional and did not behave in accordance with the theories of Gregor Mendel (the Austrian monk who founded the science of genetics). During this time Beale worked with Tracy Sonneborn, a geneticist who held unorthodox views focused around the cytoplasm containing genetic elements. Beale returned to the UK to the Institute of Animal Genetics in Edinburgh in the 1950s, where he published a series of papers that provided a synthesis of these different concepts, on the basis of which he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society (1959) and appointed as Royal Society professor in 1963. He was recognised for this malaria work with an honorary DSc in 1996 from Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok (one of the first westerners to be so honoured). He was divorced from his wife Betty, who predeceased him. He is survived by three sons, Andrew, Steven and Duncan, and three grandchildren, Emily, Joe and Sarah. \u2022 Geoffrey Herbert Beale, geneticist, born 11 June 1913; died 16 October 2009", "publicationDate": "2010-02-01T19:06:41Z", "tags": ["Genetics", "Malaria", "Science"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/feb/01/geoffrey-beale-obituary", "title": "Geoffrey Beale obituary", "sentences": ["He was recognised for this malaria work with an honorary DSc in 1996 from Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok (one of the first westerners to be so honoured)."]}, {"article": "It turns out that the phony Ferrari, a tour de force of fakery whipped up recently in a Thai backstreet garage (with a Subaru engine), isn&apos;t here.

The red orb of a full moon \u00adappeared, casting streaks of gold across the placid water of the Irrawaddy river, but even this beauty failed to displace the questions that haunted our two-week stay earlier this month. Why were we in Burma? Was our trip giving comfort to the country&apos;s military dictatorship, by common consent one of the world&apos;s worst regimes? Burma never has been a popular destination, and after the bloody \u00adsuppression of the monks&apos; protests in September 2007 and the government&apos;s delay in helping hundreds of thousands who lost everything in Cyclone Nargis the following May, the tourist trickle almost dried up. Only 47,161 people came from Europe last year, mainly from France and Germany, making Burma the country least visited by \u00adBritish people anywhere in Asia (with the exception of North Korea). So was our party of visitors wrong to buck the trend? Not if you go by the number of people who eagerly \u00adapproached us to practise their English and, after a tentative start, wanted to say what they thought of their rulers. &quot;They&apos;re mad,&quot; one driver told us as he steered his creaking banger past a crush of Chinese bicycles and motorbikes, the commonest form of transport on Burma&apos;s rutted roads. In decades of reporting I have \u00adgenerally stuck to journalism&apos;s rule number one: don&apos;t quote taxi drivers. But in a few places (Manhattan, Havana, and now Burma) you meet such a \u00advariety of characters forced to earn a living behind the wheel that their opinions offer a broad range of views. This driver had trained as a computer engineer before serving in a Burmese embassy in a western country. &quot;Life is not improving here,&quot; he said. &quot;Most people don&apos;t like the government. We have no legislative body. We have no democracy.&quot; (Apologies for breaking journalism&apos;s rule number two: don&apos;t use anonymous quotes if they are \u00adpejorative. In Burma, critical sources deserve protection.) Another driver was making political comments within five minutes of our hiring him from Rangoon airport into town. Asked if it was our first trip to Burma, I said yes, and then added, &quot;I see you call it Burma.&quot; &quot;Burma good name, Myanmar new name,&quot; he replied mischievously. When we \u00adinquired what the attractive gardens were behind locked gates on the left, &quot;That was the university. Now closed,&quot; he commented. &quot;Because of the \u00addemonstrations, when we had \u00addemonstrations. They moved all the universities out of Rangoon. Now it&apos;s quiet,&quot; he added, before smiling \u00adsarcastically: &quot;Good idea.&quot; An intelligence officer, I wondered fleetingly, working at the airport to test arriving foreigners? If so, he wasn&apos;t much of an expert, since his only \u00adquestion, apart from whether it was our first trip, was where we came from. The one good thing he found to say of the \u00adregime was that it had \u00adallowed English to be taught again in primary schools. &quot;For a time they stopped it. The army doesn&apos;t like \u00adEnglish but now it&apos;s OK again.&quot; That certainly seemed to be true. \u00adRangoon&apos;s main shopping street is brimming with cramped \u00adbookshops, full of English grammar and vocabulary manuals. Similar titles were laid out on the \u00adpavements alongside food stalls and fruit-drink stands. In contrast to Thailand, where \u00adlinguistic communication is a struggle and faces in public transport are blank and unwelcoming, Burmese friendliness is a delight. Burma is multi-ethnic and, until the military coup of 1962, was open to the world. For decades its elite spoke good English and even today most people in Rangoon and Mandalay have a smattering. Keenness for contact with foreigners is strong, for its own sake and as resistance to enforced isolation. Of course, some friendliness is \u00adcommercially driven. Vendors with bright smiles and the chat-up line &quot;Where are you from?&quot; can turn into leeches at some sites. But genuine \u00adcuriosity is more common. In the hour before sunset, when tourists routinely climb the thousand or more steps to Mandalay Hill, young monks emerge to engage in conversation, especially delighted to meet someone who speaks &quot;real English&quot;. The regime itself uses English for a few publications. Who buys them is hard to say, except perhaps the diplomatic community. They offer a dreary diet of ministerial visits to new hydro\u00adelectric projects, with the one benefit of reminding you that Burma is the last country in the world ruled by a military junta: the minister for \u00adinformation is a brigadier-general; the minister for construction is a major-general. More bizarrely, so too is the minister for culture. One copy of the government-owned newspaper New Light of Myanmar that I picked up showed the ministers of culture of Cambodia, Laos, Burma and Vietnam at a recent conference. In full military dress and medals, Burma&apos;s minister looked eccentric beside his three conventionally suited counterparts. The junta wants to shed its anachronistic image. Elections announced for this year are \u00adintended to give the regime a civilian face, of a sort anyway. The new constitution provides for a presidential system with 14 regional governments. Sizeable blocks of seats will be reserved for the army, and the commander-in-chief will have extraordinary powers. Aung San Suu Kyi, the icon of the opposition \u00adNational League for Democracy \u2013 which won the last elections in 1990 but was prevented from taking office \u2013 is of course still under house arrest. But even if she were not, this new consti\u00adtution bars her from standing for \u00adpresident. The poll will be tightly \u00adcontrolled in other ways and opposition groups are unlikely to have much room to campaign, \u00adalthough election regu\u00adlations have not yet been finalised. While people&apos;s willingness to give foreigners their opinions was the biggest surprise of our trip, the amount of access people have to dissenting views also ran counter to our preconceived picture. The BBC&apos;s Burmese radio \u00adservice is widely heard. An Oslo-based exile TV station, the Democratic Voice of Burma, can be picked up by satellites that are easily available. Rangoon and Mandalay have numerous internet \u00adcafes, which are invariably full. When I clicked on the BBC website in Burmese it came up promptly. To resist this, the regime makes the feeblest of propaganda efforts. For a flavour, take the instructions that \u00adappear under the bizarre headline The People&apos;s Desire in newspapers and on occasional roadside hoardings: 1. Oppose those relying on External \u00adElements, acting as stooges, holding negative views; 2. Oppose those trying to jeopardise the stability of the state and national progress; 3. Oppose foreign nations interfering in the internal affairs of the state; 4. Crush all internal and external destructive elements as the common enemy. The fourth of these points encapsulates the junta&apos;s preferred strategy for handling criticism \u2013 repression. The country has around 2,100 political \u00adprisoners, including many of the monks who led the 2007 street protests from Rangoon&apos;s majestic Shwedagon \u00adPagoda. Dozens were shot and killed during those protests, and public \u00adassembly is still severely restricted. The authorities are so determined to prevent crowds gathering that they have even fenced off a corner of the vast concourse, full of minor temples and Buddha statues, that surrounds the Shwedagon&apos;s golden stupa in Rangoon. This corner contains a monument to student demonstrators killed by the British in 1920, and the regime wants no parallels drawn or flowers placed in memory of more recent deaths. Britain&apos;s long occupation For British visitors, the monument is a useful reminder of Britain&apos;s long occupation of Burma, the most graphic account of which can be found in George Orwell&apos;s Burmese Days, a \u00adfictionalised memoir of the odious colleagues he worked with as an imperial policeman in northern Burma in the 1920s. The book is certainly an essential text if you want to understand the racism, brutality and violence which the \u00adBritish empire entailed, and another key text for any visitor to Burma is \u00adAmitav Ghosh&apos;s epic, The Glass Palace, covering three generations of two \u00adBurmese and Indian families. One of its most powerful sections covers the dilemma confronting Burmese nationalists during the second world war \u2013 whether to support the Japanese against the British Raj, or defend the very empire they had long sought to overthrow. The most prominent leader to face this agonising choice was Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s father, General Aung San, who first joined the Japanese but came back to the British side. One morning in Rangoon we tracked down his house, a rambling wooden building with delicately carved gables on a hillock in a northern suburb. It has long been closed to Burmese but, according to the guidebooks, foreigners could wander in and admire family photographs, some showing the young Aung San Suu Kyi. Not any more. &quot;Only on 19 July,&quot; a gardener told us through the locked railings. That is the anniversary of the day Aung San, by then Burma&apos;s prime minister, was murdered by a political rival on the eve of independence. Where there are faint signs of hope for Burma is in the aid field. Thanks to an international boycott, Burma receives less help than any other country in the world. This is one reason for the catastrophic rates of infant mortality and child malnutrition. But in recent months western governments have started to think again, since the denial of assistance hits only Burma&apos;s poorest. Foreign donors are stepping up develop\u00adment aid on top of the \u00ademergency grants supplied after Cyclone Nargis, which left an estimated 140,000 dead or missing. The junta&apos;s initial reaction to the \u00adcyclone was to refuse international help. It carried on with a refer\u00adendum on the new \u00adconstitution, as though Nargis had not happened. This further blackened its image. But under pressure from governments in the Association of South-Eastern Asian Nations (Asean), the junta changed its line and inter\u00adnational aid agency officials now say the regime has been working well with the UN and Asean in agreeing programmes, priorities and relief projects, and allowing donor money to reach people. \u00adForeign aid workers get permits to \u00adenter the \u00adaffected areas in the \u00adIrrawaddy delta. Big western non-\u00adgovernmental \u00adorganisations such as Oxfam and Save the Children are well-established in Burma, with a network of local staff. As tourists, we were allowed to spend a day in Twante, one cyclone-\u00adaffected area about 20 miles out of Rangoon. A driver whom we found \u00adindependently invited us home to lunch where his wife and other women relatives were feeding two dozen monks, a gesture the family makes about twice a year, he said. The temples played a key role in collecting clothes, food and money for cyclone victims. Private companies funded the rebuilding of many houses and schools. After the disaster, Burmese students and other young people poured into the area to help. Some were so moved that they later set up aid projects and small NGOs without government \u00adobstruction, we were told. As a result, according to a western aid worker who travels regularly to Burma, Cyclone Nargis has resulted in a broadening of independent civil society activity. Suspend travel bans Optimists argue that the institutional changes enshrined in the new consti\u00adtution will also enlarge the space for progress. There may be a clampdown in advance of the poll, one observer said, but the fact that Burma will have legislative bodies at national and local levels for the first time in more than a generation gives scope for wider \u00addebate. The International Crisis Group, which often reflects the views of the liberal wing of the western diplomatic elite, takes a similar line. &quot;Even assuming that the intention of the regime is to consolidate military rule rather than begin a transition away from it, such processes often lead in unexpected \u00addirections,&quot; it wrote in an analysis of the pre-election scene. The group suggests western governments suspend their travel bans on junta members, resume normal contact and push the message that political prisoners must be released and election campaigning be allowed to go ahead freely. The Obama administration has also announced a shift in US policy on Burma towards engagement rather than isolation, though without \u00adspecifying any concrete steps. According to articles on the online opposition website Irrawaddy, Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s party, the National League for Democracy, is involved in a tough internal debate over whether to take part in the elections. It might back certain candidates even if, as is \u00adassumed, it is barred from competing in its own right. Taking part would \u00adallow the party&apos;s supporters to revive their networks and contacts. Meanwhile, the western investment boycott has left the field open to Chinese companies. They are especially visible in Mandalay, which has a large mall called the Great Wall Shopping Centre. &quot;People respect the Chinese \u2013 they think they&apos;re cleverer than Burmese,&quot; said a young man who studied briefly in \u00adanother Asean country. &quot;They don&apos;t like Indians because Indians were the main agents of the British occupation. But the Chinese are taking over. They&apos;re close to the regime. Each side helps the other. It&apos;s like a mafia,&quot; he added. Back, then, to the nagging question: should we have toured a country with so bad a regime and such little prospect of improvement? This young man had no doubt. &quot;Bring in tourists who can spread the word from the outside world and also tell people in their own countries about Burma,&quot; he said. In Britain, the Burma Campaign UK criticises tourism and investment and publishes a &quot;dirty list&quot; of firms that do business with Burma. This includes travel companies as well as the Lonely Planet guidebooks. The campaign&apos;s website contains a December 2002 quote from Aung San Suu Kyi: &quot;We have not yet come to the point where we encourage people to come to Burma as tourists.&quot; Two other exile lobbies, Voices for Burma and Free Burma Coalition, which used to support a tourism boycott now take the opposite view. Voices for Burma also enlists Aung San Suu Kyi, though its sourcing is flimsy. Its website says: &quot;According to a close acquaintance, not yet identified but reportedly from her party, the National League of \u00adDemocracy, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has been quoted as saying that travel to her country can now be encouraged, provided arrangements are made through private organisations. She now believes that tourism might be beneficial, should the result of the visit draw attention to the oppression of the people by the military junta.&quot; While favouring engagement, Voices for Burma and the Free Burma Coalition urge tourists to do as much as possible to help private Burmese citizens and not put money in the government&apos;s pocket, and in fact it is possible to do so now as a tourist. Some fees, such as the entrance ticket for the ruined city of Bagan, the visa charge and airport departure tax, cannot be escaped. But in 2003 the government dropped the requirement that every tourist change $200 at an official exchange place. \u00adInstead of going on a package or using a UK- or Bangkok-based tour company that inevitably has contacts with the Burmese government, visitors can travel on their own by picking one of the many family-owned Burmese travel agents that work from tiny \u00adoffices in Rangoon. You make your \u00adarrangements either on the spot or by email in advance. There are also \u00adnumerous family-owned guesthouses and restaurants and thousands of \u00adprivate souvenir-makers and sellers. Thanks to the web, details of how to plan your trip are readily available. The big decision is whether to go at all. No one should imagine tourism is automatically going to make Burma a better place.

From 2004 until illness forced him to resign last December, he was secretary general of the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), the lawyers&apos; organisation working for the rule of law and human rights. With his commitment, energy, enthusiasm and flair for catching the moment, he breathed new life into the organisation. He set up the ICJ&apos;s eminent jurists panel on terrorism, counter-terrorism and human rights, which held hearings \u2013 including in the UK \u2013 and in February 2009 published a report that became the benchmark for serious discourse about problems of terrorism and human rights. The report provided compelling evidence of the devastating effects that counter-\u00adterrorism \u00admeasures such as extraordinary rendition, torture, \u00adarbitrary detention and unfair trials have had on human rights. It emphasised the need to place criminal justice systems at the heart of strategies to \u00adprevent and counter terrorism. In November 2009, the ICJ was able to address these issues with members of the UN security council. Nick was born in Melbourne, \u00adAustralia. His Polish father and French mother (of \u00adRussian ancestry) had met in \u00adEngland during the second world war and \u00ademigrated to Australia in 1952. From 1970 until 1972, he lived in Farnham, Surrey, where his father was posted as a civilian electronics engineer with the Australian navy, and attended Farnham grammar school. After returning to Sydney, he completed his studies at Waverley college and the University of New South Wales, graduating in 1984 with a BA and LLB. He briefly practised as a solicitor in Sydney and then, from 1986 to 1991, divided his time between Asia and London, with an extended stay in Tibet. There he witnessed the violent \u00adsuppression of a peaceful demonstration by monks in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, and the powerful impact of this event determined his future course. By 1988 he had co-founded the Tibet \u00adInformation Network in London. At a time when it was extremely \u00addifficult to get accurate information about the \u00adsituation in Tibet, it aimed to \u00adprovide independent, factual, \u00adunbiased \u00adinformation and analysis of events there, on subjects ranging from education and health to prisons and \u00addemonstrations. It became an essential resource for anyone working on Tibet-related issues, and he devoted much of the next two years to it while practising as a solicitor in London. In 1991, he married Lucy Cawthron in Dharamsala, India, where they were both working on projects with the Tibetan government in exile. In the same year, he joined the London-based international secretariat of Amnesty International as a legal adviser, and in 1994 became director of its legal office (now its Legal and International Organisations Programme). He was quick to see opportunities to bring international criminal law to bear on human rights issues. As legal adviser for Europe, he had pushed the organisation to support the creation in 1993 of the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. He also ensured that Amnesty played a crucial role in securing the adoption in 1998 of the Rome Statute, the treaty that \u00adestablished the international criminal court in The Hague. Typically, he was active in having Amnesty press the case for a key role for victims in the proceedings, as well as providing for victim and witness protection. In 1998 he moved on to the UN secretariat. For nearly two years, he served in the UN peacekeeping operation in Angola, where he headed the 50-strong team in its human rights division. His success in that role led the then UN high commissioner for human rights, Mary Robinson, to appoint Nick in 2002 as her regional representative for Asia-Pacific, in Bangkok. Two years later he returned to the world of non-governmental organisations as ICJ secretary general. The ICJ had for some years experienced \u00adorganisational and financial difficulties, and Nick stabilised it in both respects, identifying areas where the ICJ could be most effective and prove its worth. In addition to the work on human rights and terrorism, Nick nudged the \u00adorganisation to promote business accountability in the human rights sphere, again seizing on what was to become one of the issues of the decade. Nick had wide interests outside his professional work: he read \u00adclassical \u00adhistory, listened to music (jazz and \u00adclassical, which he played to a high standard on the piano) and was a \u00adphotographer. He enjoyed sharing these with Lucy and their three daughters, Susannah, Julia and Helena, to whom he was utterly devoted and who survive him, along with his mother, Marianne, and brother, Alexander. \u2022 Nicholas Andrew Howen, lawyer, born 18 May 1960; died 26 January 2010", "publicationDate": "2010-02-22T17:30:47Z", "tags": ["Human rights", "Torture", "Law", "Law", "World news", "UK security and counter-terrorism", "Counter-terrorism policy", "Australia news", "Tibet", "United Nations", "Asia Pacific", "Studying law"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/22/nicholas-howen-obituary", "title": "Nicholas Howen obituary", "sentences": ["His success in that role led the then UN high commissioner for human rights, Mary Robinson, to appoint Nick in 2002 as her regional representative for Asia-Pacific, in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "A Thai court is today due to decide whether the fugitive former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra can keep nearly \u00a31.5bn in assets seized by the government, a ruling that \u2013 whichever way it goes \u2013 is likely to deepen the political schism dividing the country and could trigger new waves of violence. Bangkok has gone into lockdown ahead of the judgment. Thaksin is still loved by the rural poor but despised by the Bangkok elite. While major protests by the Thaksin-loyal &quot;red shirts&quot;, which are expected to draw a million people on to the streets, have been postponed for a fortnight because of logistical problems, thousands will mass at the courthouse today. Soldiers and police are in position across Bangkok and at entrances to the capital. Busloads of protesters from the Thaksin-supporting north and north-east are expected to be turned back at the city limits. The nine judges in the case have round-the-clock security and 27 countries, including Britain, have issued warnings on travel to Thailand, and the capital in particular. Already one homemade bomb has exploded near Government House and another was defused near the supreme court. Further attacks are expected. At stake is 76bn baht (\u00a31.484bn) in cash, shares and property which Thaksin&apos;s critics argue he accumulated largely through executing policies which benefited his family company, Shin Corp, including government-sanctioned loans to the pariah state of Burma. Thaksin, forced from power by a military-led coup in 2006, fled into exile before a 2008 conflict of interest conviction that saw him sentenced to two years in jail. But he looms large still in Thai politics via video messages, Twitter and his blog, from Dubai and Cambodia. He said this week he was willing to return to negotiate a peaceful settlement but only in return for a blanket pardon: &quot;I don&apos;t want to die outside of Thailand. I don&apos;t want to return as bones and ashes.&quot; The government rejected his appeal. Almost all commentators are predicting Thaksin will be found guilty of behaving corruptly, which will be seen as vindication of the coup. &quot;I have no doubt there will be a guilty verdict, it&apos;s just a matter of how much of his assets will be taken away,&quot; said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, professor of political science at Bangkok&apos;s Chulalongkorn University. But even a compromise decision, instead of pleasing everybody, is likely to please nobody. Thitinan said: &quot;This decision is a watershed, a dramatic, critical episode in Thai politics, but it will not resolve the crisis; in fact, it is likely to exacerbate the crisis. Thaksin is someone who doesn&apos;t quit. He will not be satisfied until he gets everything back. His enemies will not be satisfied if he gets anything back. For them, this is the final act of Thaksin&apos;s political decapitation.&quot; Sustained violent protests could further damage the fragile economy and weaken the already beleaguered coalition government headed by Abhisit Vejjajiva. A veteran politician, Veera Musigapong, has said the red shirts will continue &quot;fighting against dictatorship&quot; regardless of the outcome. &quot;Our political gatherings will continue, according to our plan to bring back democracy and to overthrow the current government.&quot; A prominent Thaksin critic, Suriyasai Katasila, conceded the conflict would not die with the court decision. &quot;Thaksin will carry out his revenge against his opponents.

In an eight-hour judgement, the full bench of the court found Thaksin guilty on five counts of corruption. The nine justices agreed that the former leader had deliberately hidden his wealth and had masked his ownership of shares in his family-controlled telecommunications company, Shin Corp. The court also found that Thaksin&apos;s government pursued policies that enriched his family&apos;s companies, including through loans to countries such as Burma. The verdict was delivered under extraordinary security, with more than 20,000 armed riot police and soldiers on the streets of Bangkok. The judges were driven to the court in bulletproof vans while schools and offices near the court complex were closed. While Thaksin supporters wept openly at the verdict at small rallies in other parts of the city, the feared violent protests did not happen overnight. The former prime minister, speaking via a videolink from Dubai, described the ruling as &quot;very political&quot; and &quot;a joke for the world&quot;, and vowed to continue his fight against the Thai government. The judges ruled that of 76bn baht (1.5bn GBP) seized from Thaksin after he was forced from power, 46bn baht was earned through &quot;inappropriate means&quot;.

Many have allowed their pristine worlds to be eaten away by flash resorts, watersports and nightlife. Now you have to search a little bit harder, venture a little bit further to find footprint-free sand. There is a smattering of still-magical islands towards the Cambodian or Burmese borders, but others lie where you\u2019d least expect, such as slap-bang in the middle of the country\u2019s most developed bay. Phang Nga is home to ritzy Phuket in the west and busy Krabi to the east, but at its watery heart the sister islands of Koh Yao Noi and Koh Yao Yai pull in just a trickle of travellers, with a few basic beach-hut complexes, bars and cafes, and the odd barefoot-chic resort. After a rather wearing three-day kayaking and camping trip around Phang Nga\u2019s tinier limestone islands, my boyfriend and I were dropped by long-tail boat into the milky blue shallows in front of the east coast\u2019s Koyao Island Resort. Sandy and damp, we carted our grubby rucksacks across the hotel\u2019s neat garden, passing a group of women lazily stretching their limbs into yoga poses, to be greeted by staff wearing beautiful silk dresses and bearing passionfruit juice. Accommodation here is spoiling but relaxed, with 18 thatched-roof bungalows with open-air showers in private courtyards and a front wall made from bamboo blinds that roll up for uninterrupted views of the bay\u2019s iconic limestone stacks. \u201cDon\u2019t forget \u2013 6.30 cocktail hour!\u201d was repeated so frequently we didn\u2019t dare miss it, but after a few sickly mojitos in the company of couples slumped on giant floor cushions on the lawn, we set off across the pitch-black beach, crabs scuttling from under our bare feet. A 30-minute wander along the island\u2019s one road brought us to one of the only bars, the Pyramid, a thatched place that could have been the fictional invention of any of the cult backpacker thrillers of the 90s, mainly on account of its two other patrons, obviously regulars, \u2013 a wild-eyed, long-haired American who was teaching English locally, and a Scouser who had set off to see the world for the first time several months ago, and got stuck here, the first place he came to. \u201cYou can\u2019t get better than this,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy bother chasing the rainbow?\u201d The next day we discovered the real joy of the island, following the circular road on hotel bikes. Rather than the trinket stalls, neon and magic-mushroom bars of Koh Samui, Koh Pha-Ngan and Phi Phi, here the details that caught the eye were traditional: rubber farms (with tapping buckets hanging from trunks and square sheets of rubber drying on the ground beneath), water buffalo, cockerels, farmers. People waved or ignored us. No one tried to sell us anything, not even in the island\u2019s one village, a huddle of grocery stores, markets and the Je t\u2019aime Koh Yao cafe, serving fantastic banana milkshakes. We happily spotted kids aged 10 or 12 riding motorbikes; women exercising to pop music at a community centre; boxing schools; bored masseurs waiting for customers in roadside shacks ... in the best possible way, there wasn\u2019t much going on. We ended up back at the Pyramid, where two young honeymooners from Florida invited us to drink margaritas while they recounted how they\u2019d joined the mile-high club on their way over, and kept us laughing at their terrible impressions of our English accents until we retreated to the hotel for coconut curry. After kayaking along the deserted coast, snorkelling around the rocks, playing badminton on the lawn, we\u2019d exhausted most of Koh Yao Noi\u2019s obvious activities, but if we\u2019d had a few more days we would have cycled to find the secret beaches we\u2019d heard lay down bumpy tracks off the \u201cmain road\u201d, and caught a ferry to the larger but even less developed neighbouring island of Koh Yao Yai. Then what? There would be nothing to do but slide into that zoned-out state where filling hours becomes less important than soaking up the surrounding beauty. Instead we left by ferry to Krabi (they also run to Phuket), then visited the most obvious beauty spot in Phang Nga bay \u2013 Railay beach, the rock climbing mecca. It was stunning, but also horribly busy with European backpackers, all unaware of the peace and perfection to be found just across the water. Perhaps in their case it would have been worth chasing that rainbow.

It&apos;s just that, as I have grown older, I have found that I increasingly like spending holidays in a place where I can guarantee that I won&apos;t have to talk to anyone. Not splendid isolation exactly, no far-flung mountain huts or Buddhist retreats, rather something we might class as &quot;minimal interaction&quot;: no small-talk by the pool, late-night karaoke or group safari outings, thank you very much. For this, I blame the holidays of my childhood: invariably two weeks in a remote cottage in Anglesey. There were long walks, damsons to pick, fields of cows and sheep to admire and occasional trips to the beach but, crucially, also plenty of time to read, eat, sleep and row about in the creek at the bottom of the garden. I would holiday there still, were it not for the flat grey skies and the viciously cold Irish Sea. For the past few years I have been trying to find somewhere that, while warmer than north Wales in August, is still just as quiet and still and lovely. And so it may puzzle you to learn that I recently took a holiday to Thailand. Some 14 million people flock here each year, drawn by the natural beauty and myriad delights: elephant rides and jungle adventures, temples, beaches, romantic idylls and, of course, phenomenal food. As I stood on the streets of Bangkok, breathing in the canteen smells and the diesel smoke, listening to the calls of the market vendors selling everything from Viagra to coconut water, and wind-up toy dogs to neatly-threaded garlands of flowers, I began to fear that visiting Thailand to escape the world might have been a giant mistake. But Bangkok was not my ultimate destination. Two hundred miles east of this giddying street, near the Cambodian border, lies the small island of Koh Kood, home to rainforest, coconut and rubber plantations, sleepy fishing villages, and fewer than 2,000 people. Koh Kood&apos;s great advantage is its relative remoteness. Getting there requires an internal flight or train journey from Bangkok, followed by an hour&apos;s boat ride from the mainland. This sounds more of an expedition than it actually is. It&apos;s about an hour from Bangkok to the small airport at Trat, with its manicured lawns and string of topiary elephants along the runway. The car ride to the ferry port took me through lush green countryside, past villages and temples and fruit stalls. And there are, I thought to myself as I watched the land disappear and the surf ride up behind our speedboat, surely worse ways to spend an hour than sailing the clear blue waters of the Gulf of Thailand, especially if you care to use the time for a bit of dolphin-spotting. Accommodation on Koh Kood is varied. There are homestays and budget hotels, as well as a handful of luxury resorts, but even these promote a barefoot, relaxed approach. There are no landlines, little internet access, and few cars. Electricity is minimal \u2013 homes and hotels rely on generators or solar power. All is slow, warm tranquillity. I disembarked at the jetty of Away, a quietly luxurious resort with a cluster of bungalows overlooking a bay. There&apos;s plenty of warm and graceful hospitality here, as well as a spa and one of Koh Kood&apos;s best diving centres, but no one jostles you into a hike or a snorkelling excursion. Mostly this makes for a fine place to do nothing; slow and calm and unruffled, you can feel Koh Kood subtly working its way into your bones. On an average day here I did little beyond loll about in the hammocks and deckchairs along the boardwalk, beneath the palm trees, and strategically positioned on the jetty to take in the sunset. I took a kayak across the clear blue sea to a small golden curve of beach; I took a quiet boat ride over to it the next bay. I swam, I slept, I read some Per Petterson, and amid the cool rooms and quiet corners, I felt my mind gently unwinding. Most evenings, when the sun was low but the air was still heavy and damp, I strolled into the nearby village, for dinner or a beer. The road is a dusty strip, tan-coloured and warm underfoot, and at night the jungle grows inky black, full of twitching, chirruping, wild sounds \u2013 the calls of birds and frogs and monkeys. The restaurants here are simple but fantastic, and after even a short walk through the thick evening air you are pleased to find a cold bottle of Chang beer and a bowl of yellow curry. A short jeep drive from Away, Shantaa is an undeniable step up in luxury. The 10 private villas sit on a hillside, amid lush gardens, with a simple stylish bedroom, a balcony and an open-air bathroom, home to exotic flowers, passing geckos and, to my great excitement, even the occasional iguana. There is a village nearby where you could venture for dinner, but it would be hard to leave the resort&apos;s restaurant. Family-owned and staffed by students, it is one of the island&apos;s best. The menu offers traditional Thai dishes plus some twists, such as raw sea bass salad with peanut sauce, and mango parfait with coconut ice cream. I can think of few places I have enjoyed staying more. Flinging open the doors of my villa to lie in bed and watch the sun rise over the palms each morning, I would cross over the wooden pier to walk along the long stretch of soft, pale sand. Afternoons would be spent swimming in the warm turquoise sea, sipping limeade at the beachside cafe, and taking an open-air Thai massage, all feet and breath and tiger balm, to the sound of birdsong and the steady hush of the waves. For a treat I spent my last night at Soneva Kiri, which was a bit of a trip from the sublime to the ridiculous. Imagine an uber-swanky Center Parcs, an enclosed resort amid acres of forest and organic vegetable gardens, where guests fly in by private plane, and spend their days in a kind of ludicrous Hollywood luxury; where you have your own personal valet, and everyone hums about on golf buggies and retro bicycles, shuttling between the spa and the library and the giant inflatable cinema screen (available for private hire, should the mood strike you). I can think of few places less like the remote Welsh cottage of my childhood holidays, and even if you can&apos;t afford to stay there, the resort&apos;s Benz&apos;s restaurant is worth seeking out, for an exquisite, Thai feast, from leaf-wrapped mieng kam to sweet tapioca in coconut milk and perfectly ripe mango and dragonfruit, served as you watch the sun dip below the water and the fireflies begin to blink. Later, as I took a midnight swim beneath a clear sky and a full moon, I thought how finally, after all this time, I had found an island every bit as quiet and still and lovely as a rainy Anglesey in August.", "publicationDate": "2010-03-13T00:05:48Z", "tags": ["Thailand holidays", "Beach holidays", "Asia", "Hotels", "Travel"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/mar/13/thailand-traditional-unspoilt-island", "title": "Thailand's last unspoilt islands: Koh Kood", "sentences": ["As I stood on the streets of Bangkok, breathing in the canteen smells and the diesel smoke, listening to the calls of the market vendors selling everything from Viagra to coconut water, and wind-up toy dogs to neatly-threaded garlands of flowers, I began to fear that visiting Thailand to escape the world might have been a giant mistake.", "But Bangkok was not my ultimate destination.", "Getting there requires an internal flight or train journey from Bangkok, followed by an hour&apos;s boat ride from the mainland.", "It&apos;s about an hour from Bangkok to the small airport at Trat, with its manicured lawns and string of topiary elephants along the runway."]}, {"article": "Koh Sichang Tiny Sichang, a short boat hop from the town of Si Racha, an hour east of the Thai capital, is the nearest island to Bangkok yet has never made it onto the travellers&apos; circuit.

Koh Tarutao Set in the furthest-flung southern corner of Thailand&apos;s Andaman coast, 26km long Tarutao has incredible forest-rimmed beaches, wild jungles and no mod-cons.

Koh Phayam Up near the Burmese border, a two-hour boat ride from the town of Ranong, Phayam has slowly emerged as the sleepy island of choice for travellers eager to avoid the over-development of Phangan and Samui. Huge, arcing sandy beaches, excellent snorkelling, no cars and plenty of cashew trees and hornbills set the scene. Bamboo Bungalows do what they say on the tin. There&apos;s also a tropical garden, Wi-Fi, motorbikes, surfing, snorkelling, fishing and volleyball. Koh Jum A short hop from the famed travellers&apos; hub of Krabi, Jum certainly lacks the glamour of its near neighbour, Phi Phi.

Cheap doubles may be a fundamental part of British culture, those 40% ABV glasses of tongue-numbing, liver-compromising liquor that are poured lovelessly down gaping gullets during Unhappy Hours in pubs and bars up and down this thoroughly peculiar country, but somebody forgot to tell England&apos;s batsmen. Of the eight major Test-playing countries, England are the only ones without a Test double-century against either Bangladesh or Zimbabwe. Even Jason Gillespie got one. England don&apos;t really do doubles at all, cheap or otherwise. In the last 20 years they have managed just eight in Tests, which puts them below everyone except Zimbabwe and Bangladesh. Sri Lanka have 27. That&apos;s a damning statistic, and one of the reasons why England currently have no batsmen with a Test average in the fifties (the fact most of them aren&apos;t especially good has also contributed in its own small way). Alastair Cook, who resumes on 158 in Chittagong today, will never have a better chance of making a double-century, never in all his puff. Surely he will go on to &quot;make it a Daddy&quot;, as Graham Gooch, his mentor and England batting coach, constantly demands. The way Bangladesh bowled yesterday, Cook could probably get his average up to 50 as well if he really wanted: he only needs to score 654 not out to do so. Realistically, Cook and England, who were 374 for three overnight, will probably aim to bat for another 45 overs at just shy of five runs per over: that would take them to around 600 halfway through the afternoon session, and allow their young seam attack to have a go with the new ball either side of tea. In those three exasperating draws in the Caribbean last winter, England faffed around for more than 150 overs each time in the first innings. I doubt they will repeat that mistake here. It should all add up to a pretty straightforward victory, but with only one spinner you never know.* * You do know. You know full well. I&apos;m just trying to whip up some interest at 3am on a Saturday morning. Work with me here  A free piece of advice If you ever walk towards Guardian Towers from St Pancras International in the early hours of Saturday morning, don&apos;t take the shortcut up the hill on Goods Way. You might get an unexpected reminder that all the foie gras in the world won&apos;t change the fact that this is still Kings Cross in nature as well as name. It&apos;s going to take a long time to burn that particular sight from the memory.  Saturday morning, who&apos;s gonna play with me? Anyone got anything to talk about today? Good night out was it? Ah. Go on, tell me.  91st over: England 375-3 (Cook 158, Collingwood 32) It&apos;ll be the swing bowler Rubel Hossain to begin from the Ispahani End. This ball is only 10 overs old but it hardly moved off the straight all day yesterday. Rubel&apos;s second ball is a good yorker that Collingwood jabs down on. A no-ball is the only run from the over. Here&apos;s some stattage on Collingwood: with a qualification of 25 innings, no Englishman in the last 30 years has a higher Test average overseas. &quot;Morning!&quot; says Matt L, coming over all Patrick Swayze in Donnie Darko. &quot;I am ever so slightly refreshed and looking forward to some England-Bangladesh action. I would like to confess that this is not the first time I have tried to get published on an OBO in the small hours after a night of liver rot. Last time my drunken ramblings were rejected and Bull, I think, published some rubbish email about the pitch from Gary Naylor. Rejected, I proceeded to set up an email account in Naylor&apos;s name fully intending to write in confessing on his behalf to various acts of sexual deviancy. Fortunately for all involved I fell a sleep on the keyboard before sending anything. Anyway, enjoy the game.&quot; I&apos;m just looking forward to the first email from &apos;Gary Naylor&apos;.  92nd over: England 376-3 (Cook 159, Collingwood 32) Shakib Al Hasan will start at the other end, a slightly surprising move given how new this ball is. His first delivery is a full toss that Cook whips to leg for a single. It&apos;s an otherwise good over, and the fifth delivery turns Collingwood round, with the edge popping low and just to the left of silly point. &quot;I went to bed at 1am and set an alarm to get up and join you for this as way of thanks for yesterday&apos;s link,&quot; says Niall Harden, &quot;but my brain is very cross with me for doing so and the only interesting thing I can think of is that I emailed Gordon Brown yesterday telling him to keep his head up and not get too upset. I can provide the same service to you now, no problem. Also, I posted on Twitter that a show on the BBC was &apos;shit&apos; (it was Great Unanswered Questions) and within minutes someone involved in making the show got in touch to say sorry. Freaked me right out.&quot;  93rd over: England 377-3 (Cook 160, Collingwood 32) Rubel&apos;s first delivery to Cook is a good one that seams away enough to slip past the outside edge of Cook&apos;s defensive push. There are no slips for Cook, so Bangladesh aren&apos;t exactly thirsty for wickets. Cook pushes a quick single to equal his Test-best score of 160. &quot;Your view of Kings Cross is 100 per cent correct,&quot; says Neill Brown with disconcerting certainty. &quot;It amuses me that the first thing all those travelling to the Olympics in 2012 via Eurostar will see is the clean, well-presented St Pancras, when less than a mile away is the more accurate picture of modern London. It&apos;s like choosing to go to Denmark on your holidays and being greeted with a cold lager, served by a stunning blonde, only to find the real country here...&quot;  94th over: England 377-3 (Cook 160, Collingwood 32) Cook, trying to cut, is beaten by a ball from Shakib that was too close for the shot. Mushfiqur dropped it away. It&apos;s a maiden from Shakib, and England have scored just three runs from four overs so far. &quot;Evening/Morning/Whatever the hell it is Rob,&quot; says Phil Sawyer. &quot;Improbably, my boss let me leave early today to watch the inaugural IPL match. I&apos;ve therefore been on the sauce since 2.30pm. However, being your classic insomniac, I still find myself here at 3am in the morning waiting for the Test to start, desperately downing pints of water to stave off the dark tendrils of the hangover that I know is going to catch up with me at some point during the morning session. If I send you an email that consists entirely of a low zombie-like groan you&apos;ll know that&apos;s me done for the night.&quot;  95th over: England 382-3 (Cook 160, Collingwood 37) Rubel spears in a leg-stump half-volley and Collingwood pings it economically through midwicket for the first boundary of the day. &quot;It&apos;s great to see Pietersen find his form just before the IPL starts,&quot; says Ian Copestake. &quot;What with Eoin Morgan in good shape after the one-dayers as well, international cricket has confirmed its new role as fluffer before the all-important porn-fest in India.&quot; I really don&apos;t understand or care about the IPL. None of the teams have any identity. It&apos;s like the bloody Sugababes.  96th over: England 384-3 (Cook 161, Collingwood 38) Cook takes a single off Shakib to move to 161, his highest Test score. Make. It. A. Daddy. &quot;Given that it is 10am in Bangkok, I am at a slight advantage,&quot; says Paul Sumner. &quot;Actually, if you arranged TV coverage, I&apos;d do the OBO for you. There is not a lot else to do as Bangkok is supposed to be brought to a standstill by protesters this weekend. Friday was a bit of a joke, the organisers promised a million, and whilst no-one believed them, more than the 7,000 who did turn up were expected.&quot;  97th over: England 388-3 (Cook 165, Collingwood 38) Cook times Rubel very pleasantly down the ground for his first boundary of the day. That was an extremely good shot. &quot;To carry on the theme of last night&apos;s OBO, I state my case as the biggest loser by passing up a &apos;sure thing&apos; (as I&apos;m sure more successful humans would call it) for an early night and an early start to follow your coverage,&quot; apologises Paul Goodchild. &quot;If Cook doesn&apos;t make 200 I&apos;m going to weep into my Horlicks.&quot;  98th over: England 388-3 (Cook 165, Collingwood 38) Collingwood thinks about charging Shakib and then decides against it when Shakib drops shot. He is in a good groove here, Shakib. Collingwood, looking for the oxygen of runs, goes flying down the track and drags a big yahoo into his pad and over the right shoulder of short leg, who was looking somewhere towards long-on in anticipation of Collingwood connecting with the shot. Shakib&apos;s figures today are 4-1-3-0. &quot;I&apos;m currently following your OBO from press row at an NBA game,&quot; says Dave Hogg, whose life may or may not be more interesting than mine. &quot;All I can say is that I&apos;m looking forward to the resumption of the match in order to see some competitive sport this evening.&quot;  99th over: England 389-3 (Cook 166, Collingwood 38) Cook survives a very good shout for LBW from Rubel. It pitched on middle from over the wicket and came back just enough as Cook pushed defensively around his front pad. Hawkeye shows it would have hit a decent portion of off stump and there were no issues over bounce, so Cook was pretty fortunate there. England are struggling for runs this morning: 15 from nine overs.  100th over: England 390-3 (Cook 167, Collingwood 38) Collingwood is lucky that a vicious grubber from Shakib is wide of off stump, because it beat his attempted forcing shot completely. &quot;Please can you post a link to this,&quot; says Neil Withers. &quot;A friend of mine, Cranston Watts is running the &apos;Marathon des Sables&apos; on 2 April this year. It&apos;s known as the toughest race on earth and is 250 km over six days in the Sahara. On foot. Running. It&apos;s in aid of destitute orphan children in south-east India. He&apos;s mental and also the brother of Scottish international Fraser Watts \u2013 so there&apos;s even a tenuous link to cricket!&quot; You had me at running.  101st over: England 396-3 (Cook 172, Collingwood 39) Cook drives Rubel gunbarrel-straight for four. A top shot. Meanwhile, here&apos;s Mac Millings, and you know what that means. &quot;Tell that rank amateur, The 97th Over&apos;s Paul Goodchild, that the competition has been called to a halt, and the biggest loser found. Millings is here. Yesterday, Neil Stork-Brett said he dated a &apos;pneumatically-assisted equestrian rider who was also a part-time swimsuit model&apos;? Wow, what a loser. So he dumped her. Big deal. He had his oats, and dropping someone because they&apos;re &apos;superficial and not very bright&apos; is perfectly acceptable. It&apos;s happened to me lots of times. My version of the Storkers story is as follows. I met a girl at university, and it soon became clear that, beyond logic, she liked me, so I made my smooth Millings move, but this time it worked. We didn&apos;t go, y&apos;know, there, but a nice time was had. So the next day, I asked a housemate of mine what he thought of this girl. &apos;She&apos;s all right,&apos; he said, &apos;but she&apos;s got a big chin.&apos; I immediately realised he was right, and when I went out for a drink with her that night, all I could see was that massive mandible of hers, jutting. We had a couple of quiet drinks, and that was that. A few weeks later, I bumped into her in the canteen, and we sat opposite each other, exchanging pleasantries, until she said, &apos;It&apos;s a shame nothing happened between us, because I really, really love sex.&apos; And you might think she was just saying that to rub it in - and maybe, in part, she was - but the worst part was that I could tell she really, really meant it. So, Stork-Brett had his fun, and then dumped the hot girl, whereas I missed out on, potentially, weeks of top rumpo (which, in Aggregate Nookie Time would have added up to, literally, minutes) just because the girl had a fairly large chin. As a side note, a few months ago I got an update email saying that Neil Stork-Brett was now following me on Twitter, but by the time I had excitedly logged on to see if it was true, he had already dropped me. No one does loser like me.&quot;  102nd over: England 407-3 (Cook 173, Collingwood 48) Collingwood, on the charge, launches Shakib for a big six over midwicket. He&apos;s been itching to play that stroke for a few overs. &quot;Just off to bed here on the pacific coast of Mexico, nine thirty at night,&quot; says Mal. &quot;Here is a little something to lighten the mood.&quot; In the event that this links to some kind of sexx porn, it&apos;s important to point out that Rob Smyth is not legally responsible for whatever YouTube links the Guardian post under his byline.  WICKET! England 412-4 (Cook ct and b Mahmudullah 173) Dear Lord. What an extraordinary dismissal. The new bowler Mahmudullah sends down a filthy long hop and Cook, trying to hoick it out of the ground, just screws it straight back to the bowler. He leans on his bat in a combination of disbelief and disgust. What a weird way to end such a fine innings.  103rd over: England 412-4 (Collingwood 53, Bell 0) Earlier in the over Collingwood reached an excellent half-century from 76 balls. What a wonderful winter he has had. He steals a very sharp two to fine leg next ball, and England will hopefully kick off now after that fairly slow start. &quot;The pure, manly athleticism and coiled aggression fairly leaping out of that picture of the captains currently leading off this OBO will surely put paid to the locals&apos; gridiron-based disdain for cricket here in Alabama once and for all,&quot; says David Moore. &quot;Long conversations &apos;round the office watercooler about the merits of stationing someone at third man, at last you can be mine.&quot;  104th over: England 418-4 (Collingwood 55, Bell 4) Ian Bell needs a duck for an average of 227 against Bangladesh, having scored that many against them without being dismissed in the two-Test series of 2005. He fails, getting off the mark with a single and then premeditating a lap for a couple. He will enjoy this situation.  105th over: England 424-4 (Collingwood 56, Bell 9) Confident stuff from Bell, who dances down the track and drives Mahmudullah down the ground for four. This is the sort of innings in which he&apos;s damned if he does and damned if he doesn&apos;t. If he fails, he&apos;s Ian Bell; and if he scores a breezy 110-ball century, well, look at the score when he came in. &quot;I must be a bigger loser than the other emailers hanging on after a night on the booze,&quot; says Rai Skrupskis. &quot;It&apos;s 9pm here (New Mexico) and I have chosen to follow the OBO (lager in hand) rather than go out. All in hopes of a crushing Test victory. Pathetic, isn&apos;t it? Can&apos;t wait for the Ashes.&quot;  106th over: England 425-4 (Collingwood 57, Bell 9) &quot;Hello from the past: it&apos;s still Friday night here,&quot; says Troy Bassett. &quot;In Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA, I am struggling mightily to stay awake for at least part of the Test (which starts at 10:30 pm). BTW, I&apos;m new to cricket so I was very excited to get my Trent Bridge England-Bangladesh ODI tickets in the mail this week. It will be my first live match. Any advice for what to bring to the match? What to do in Nottingham?&quot; Go to Selectadisc! And the Social!  107th over: England 427-4 (Collingwood 57, Bell 10) England need to get a jump on here. There is no point at all scoring at two or three an over. They only need another 100-150 runs; whether they are four down or nine down is an irrelevance. And we could all do with something to keep us awake. &quot;What is your take on Cook?&quot; asks Elliot Wilson. &quot;Is he the real deal yet? I still have this lingering feeling that deep down he&apos;s still a boy in man&apos;s trousers, as evidenced by the need to refer to his father-figure-mentor G. Gooch on a reasonably regular basis.&quot; I think he&apos;s long a way from the real deal, as two fifty-plus scores in 10 Ashes Tests would suggest. This innings was excellent but it doesn&apos;t really change anything. His temperament is admirable, and because of that I still like the idea of trying him at No3 with a dasher opening alongside Strauss. He is still only 25, something we sometimes forget because he has been around for nearly four years now.  108th over: England 429-4 (Collingwood 58, Bell 11) Two from Shakib&apos;s over. &quot;I think that settles it,&quot; says Dean Butler. &quot;Troy is the biggest loser.&quot;  109th over: England 430-4 (Collingwood 59, Bell 11) One from Mahmudullah&apos;s over as England continue to bat for a draw. In the Sky box, Dominic Cork reckons England will try to bat on to 650 and declare an hour before the close. Bugger that. Get them in half an hour before tea. England are so bloody hopeless at ramming home a dominant position. I realise I am now criticising England for something they haven&apos;t even done yet, but it&apos;s 4.45am so I&apos;m running with it.  110th over: England 432-4 (Collingwood 60, Bell 12) England are looking for quick singles at every opportunity. That&apos;s good. What&apos;s less good is the fact they&apos;re picking up about two an over. England aren&apos;t so much applying the foot to the throat as offering a hand and saying Are you alright mate? Ooh I&apos;m really sorry, I didn&apos;t mean to hurt you. Can I get you anything? My bank details? Yeah sure, take what you like. My wife? Yeahhhhh, why not. Knock yourself out.  111th over: England 434-4 (Collingwood 61, Bell 13) These are basically the boring middle overs of the 50-over match. It&apos;s pretty unfathomable. England haven&apos;t hit a boundary \u2013 or even tried to hit one \u2013 for half an hour or so. Sometimes the box seat can get a bit too snug. &quot;Hello from the future,&quot; says James Walton. &quot;It&apos;s 12.40pm here in Wuhan China... you&apos;ll be happy to know that the world hasn&apos;t ended and the local bar has started selling Strongbow. I&apos;m currently nursing an massive headache as a result.&quot; I would suggest hair of the dog, but given the fact we&apos;re talking about Strongbow it&apos;s probably best just to take the hangover.  112th over: England 439-4 (Collingwood 66, Bell 13) Abdur Razzak replaces Shakib Al Hasan, who bowled pretty well this morning. Five from the over. This is modest cricket from England: 65 runs from 22 overs this morning while batting for a declaration on a flat one against Bangladesh does not compute. &quot;Would I be alone in thinking England should switch to Twenty20 mode and just try and smack everything out of the ground?&quot; asks Phil Withall. &quot;They&apos;re in a position where it really wouldn&apos;t hurt to try.&quot; If you&apos;re online following the OBO at this hour I suspect you&apos;re alone in a fair few things, but I agree that England should give it some humpty.  113th over: England 444-4 (Collingwood 68, Bell 16) That&apos;s a good shot from Bell, a graceful and classy push through the covers for three off Mahmudullah. &quot;Don&apos;t take my de-Tweeting (?) of you personally, young Millings,&quot; says Neil Stork-Brett. &quot;I had deactivated my account within two weeks of signing up as I realised I really had nothing to say that was even remotely interesting, funny or incisive. No, I save that particular &apos;pleasure&apos; for Smyth and my fellow OBO-ers.&quot; I wish somebody would put Twitter back in its box.  114th over: England 445-4 (Collingwood 69, Bell 16) Razzak almost hurries a quicker one through Collingwood. One from the over and this game really needs some Red Bull. &quot;Here&apos;s my tip for Troy Bassett, new to cricket in the 106th over: try not to lose your ticket between the gates and getting to your seat - that&apos;s what I managed to do at my first taste of live cricket at the T20 World Cup last summer, and it caused no end of trouble!&quot; says Sara &apos;No, cricket isn&apos;t exactly big here in Finland&apos; Torvalds.  115th over: England 446-4 (Collingwood 70, Bell 16) Collingwood, possibly out of sheer boredom, walks down the track to Mahmudullah but doesn&apos;t really go through with the shot and the ball plops into the off side off the pad. He does it again later in the over but this time squirts it to short square leg. &quot;Christ!&quot; says John Leavey, misidentifying me again. &quot;This is dull. What are we trying to do? Improve Bangladesh&apos;s Test ranking? No other game plan seems to be being applied.&quot;  116th over: England 450-4 (Collingwood 72, Bell 18) Four singles from Razzak&apos;s over. The last boundary was 11 overs ago, which is ridiculous in the circumstances. I can only think that England have decided to bat five and a half sessions in this innings and are tailoring their approach accordingly, but I really don&apos;t see the point of wasting extra time in the game. As Millings would doubtless ask, why do in 20 minutes what you can do in 20 seconds? &quot;In order to encourage the teams to hit more boundaries, how about some flashing lights, terrible music and unhappy dancing people every time the ball clears the ropes?&quot; asks Niall Harden.  117th over: England 455-4 (Collingwood 72, Bell 22) Mahmudullah is very harshly wided by Rod Tucker for a delivery that wasn&apos;t far down the leg side to Bell. Maybe he just wanted to move his hands a bit in an attempt to stay awake. Mahmudullah then drops hopelessly short and \u2013 glory be\u00a0\u2013 Bell pulls for four. That&apos;s the first boundary since the 105th over. &quot;Alas, I am unable to comply with the 91st over&apos;s promises of tales of sexual deviancy, but can I confess to a cricketing deviancy?&quot; says Gary Naylor, limbering up for another stint on Test Match Sofa. &quot;I much prefer Colly in Brigadier Block mode batting all day on a minefield for 67 than to see him at his most, er, fluent. Bell&apos;s forward press is a bit unnecessary against this bowling isn&apos;t it?&quot;  118th over: England 467-4 (Collingwood 75, Bell 31) Two fours in the over! I&apos;ll never forget where I was for this moment. Both came to Bell. The first was an excellent steer past slip off Razzak, and the second a feather through the covers. &quot;This is as tedious as Emmerdale,&quot; says Dean Butler. &quot;I&apos;ve got TMS on. It merely consists of Mark Butcher rambling about....I&apos;m not even sure. F1 I think. By the way TMS appear to have taken the Strauss option and sent out the B team. The TMS Lions if you will.&quot;  119th over: England 473-4 (Collingwood 77, Bell 34) &quot;Not that it&apos;s surprising we are doing well against Bangla, but has anyone actually looked world-class against them,&quot; wonders Paddy Blewer. &quot;I&apos;m stuck in Sydney waiting for annother flight to Canberra and wondered idly what a really brutal in form batsman might do. Early 90s Robin Smith? Viv? Richie Richardson?&quot; Slats. Smith would have struggled a wee bit against all these spinners, surely.  120th over: England 481-4 (Collingwood 82, Bell 35) England are still, for the most part, doing their work in ones and twos, but those are coming at an increasingly healthy rate now. That&apos;s partly because England are taking more risks in their running, and Collingwood survives a tightish run-out referral after taking two to fine leg. &quot;Very fit man Collingwood&quot; phwoars Bob Willis. &quot;This doesn&apos;t even sound like TMS, it sounds like my radio has wandered onto strange frequencies where lorry drivers talk about nothing,&quot; says Niall Harden. &quot;I might get out of bed and start drinking again. Winner!&quot; There&apos;s nobody in the office. Not even the cleaners. There&apos;s an oven-temperature can of Carling \u2013 Carling \u2013 leering at me from the other side of the sports desk. I can feel the slightest moistness in my mouth. It shouldn&apos;t have come to this.  121st over: England 485-4 (Collingwood 85, Bell 36) Naeem Islam comes tantalisingly close to justifying his existence by bowling the penultimate over before lunch. Collingwood reverse-sweeps for three, one of them an overthrow.  122nd over: England 487-4 (Collingwood 86, Bell 37) That was a bit of a nothing session really: England scored 113 runs for the loss of Alastair Cook, who made 173 and will wonder for a long time how he got out to a rank long hop. See you in 30 minutes.  LUNCH  A loser in his own lunchtime &quot;Does it make me a default winner of the loser battle to email in my offering a day late having retrospectively read the OBO while eating a Fry&apos;s Chocolate Creme bar?&quot; wrote Tom Bowtell yesterday afternoon. &quot;My most glorious loserish moment came in November 2002 during the Ashes when I went to The Ministry Of Sound to celebrate my friend&apos;s birthday. I am not a Ministry of Sound kind of person and found it all a little overwhelming and loud. At about 1.30am I decided I could take it no more so I slipped off the the toilets, locked myself in a cubical and there, in a place where endless drug sniffs, sexual jaunts and boozed-up fisticuffs had taken place, I sat on the closed toilet lid and listened to the TMS commentary on the second Ashes Test on my Roberts Sport Radio for about an hour. Damien Martyn was grinding out a 229-ball 95 and Richard Dawson was being plucky. At one point Dawson beat him twice in an over. At another point I caught a glimpse of myself reflected in the chrome toilet paper dispenser on the wall: and for the first time in ages I liked what I saw.&quot;  123rd over: England 488-4 (Collingwood 87, Bell 37) It&apos;s almost light outside. You&apos;re all asleep, aren&apos;t you. Shahadat Hossain will begin this afternoon session with his first over of the day. He starts with a bit of off-theory to Collingwood, to a 7-2 field. After a few deliveries well outside off, Collingwood tries to an ungainly swipe to leg, meeting only with fresh air. He then charges the final delivery and plays tip-and-run to mid-off. A good over from Shahadat, though. &quot;I suppose most teams hate touring Bangladesh as it is such a potential banana skin,&quot; says Don Wilson. &quot;Sooner rather than later they are going to beat one of the major sides in a Test match and nobody wants to be the first one. At least England have avoided this fate, unless they stuff it up in the second Test of course.&quot; Adelaide!  124th over: England 492-4 (Collingwood 90, Bell 38) Abdur Razzak will continue at the other end. Four from the over, the last two because of yet another misfield. Jack would be a very dull boy if he had to watch this. So what is the plan for England, anyway? I still think they should bat for no more than 80 minutes in this session, but the consensus among the Sky team is that they will go on until tea. That&apos;ll be fun. &quot;I have to be awake,&quot; says Dean Butler. &quot;They pay me for it. Two hours left and then home where I will drink until I&apos;m unconcious. Wake up at 8pm and start this shite again. Oh I love life.&quot; All together now...  125th over: England 494-4 (Collingwood 90, Bell 39)Shahadat continues with his off-theory to Collingwood. It&apos;s a decent plan because, as Mike Atherton says on Sky, Collingwood will have to manufacture strokes he would normally be loath to play if he is to keep the scoreboard moving at a good rate. Collingwood is restless, walking down the track a lot, but he can&apos;t gete Shahadat away and there are just two from the over.  126th over: England 501-4 (Collingwood 91, Bell 44) Collingwood works Razzak to leg for his 4000th Test run. That&apos;s 4000 more than most people thought he&apos;d score when he had a traumatic introduction to international cricket in the summer of 2001, and 3881 more than he thought he&apos;d score when he was omitted following that traumatic Test in Multan in 2005. He is a thoroughly admirable fellow, a true credit to the strawberry-blond community. Later in the over, Bell, who is also strawberry blond, makes room to lift Razzak high over extra cover for four. For a while it looked like Tamim Iqbal might take the catch running round from long off, but the placement was excellent.  127th over: England 505-4 (Collingwood 92, Bell 47) &quot;In the US it&apos;s only 1.30am so after a cool beverage or three the chance to watch some proper Test cricket before bed is quite tempting,&quot; says Paul Delve, lining up the inevitable &apos;however&apos;. &quot;However having watched an hour or so, there isn&apos;t any proper Test cricket on. If you can&apos;t catch a ball what chance do you have? I don&apos;t like to be too negative but I&apos;m off to bed. This is rubbish. Just declare already for a bit of entertainment.&quot;  128th over: England 513-4 (Collingwood 99, Bell 48) Collingwood tickles Razzak fine for four \u2013 I think it came off just pad but was given as runs \u2013 and then square-drives for three to move to 99. &quot;So, you can see when it&apos;s dawn (123rd over),&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;We all imagined you in a dank basement (even new buildings come equipped with a dank basement; it&apos;s an old charter or something) lit only by flickering modems, but now it seems you have a little tent of blue that prisoners call the sky. Silver sails too?&quot;  129th over: England 524-4 (Collingwood 100, Bell 57) Collingwood gets his tenth Test century with a push into the off side for a single off Shahadat. They do indeed all count. Bell cover-drives the next ball sumptuously for four to reach his half-century, and then he drives the following delivery back whence it came for four more pristine runs.  130th over: England 530-4 (Collingwood 105, Bell 58) Collingwood gets in a tangle while reverse-sweeping Razzak, and as the ball loops back towards his stumps he half-volleys it to safety with his right foot. Back of the netc. He gets four from an orthodox sweep later in the over, but only because of some dismal fielding from Shahadat. Bangladesh have been desperately poor in the field.  131st over: England 535-4 (Collingwood 108, Bell 60) &quot;I&apos;ve had sex with a woman from every one of the Test-playing nations except New Zealand,&quot; says  Walter Mitty  Dean Butler, who may or may not be high as a kite on energy drinks. &quot;Has anyone completed the full set?&quot; Given that we&apos;re the only two people here, you know the answer to that, don&apos;t you.  132nd over: England 542-4 (Collingwood 114, Bell 61) Collingwood gives Razzak the charge and lifts him lazily to cow corner for four more. &quot;Do you genuinely think it likely that a new captain (stand-in, no less), is likely to declare at any point before batting the opposition out of the game?&quot; asks Olly Bevan. &quot;I don&apos;t know what Cook is like as a captain, but it&apos;s probably ok if he&apos;s a little churlish at this point (though I appreciate this makes your job mind-numbing). Any more inspired rants by either Willis or Key?&quot; But it&apos;s Bangladesh! As for rants, I don&apos;t think even Bob can be bothered. Talking of Bob, who would you least like to bump into in a dark alley: this Bob or this Bob?  133rd over: England 547-4 (Collingwood 116, Bell 63) Shakib Al Hasan replaces Shahadat, who bowled diligent off-theory for at least three overs before deciding he simply couldn&apos;t be bothered any longer. There is a single from each delivery except the last, so even I can work out that there were five runs from the over. &quot;You got the night shift again,&quot; says Jeremy Bunting. &quot;Coincidence or chance? Do you volunteer or are you going to work on your way back from last night?&quot; I don&apos;t know anymore.  134th over: England 553-4 (Collingwood 119, Bell 66) &quot;OK, I&apos;d love for Ian Ronald to get a century too, but surely it&apos;s time to declare?! Shouldn&apos;t Cook pretend to have more faith in his bowlers than the rest of us do?&quot; says Sara &apos;I&apos;m the only one on this train to Helsinki who knows, let alone cares that Collingwood hit a century&apos; Torvalds.  135th over: England 565-4 (Collingwood 126, Bell 68) Shakib drops a stinging return chance offered by Collingwood. It was a full toss, and Collingwood really clubbed it back whence it came. Shakib, reaching two-handed to his right, couldn&apos;t hang on. Bell drives a single next ball, and that means he has the greatest record of any Test batsman against a single country. Exciting times. Collingwood goes down the track later in the over and drives a delightful straight six.  136th over: England 583-4 (Collingwood 134, Bell 79) Eighteen from the over. It starts with another six from Collingwood, this one spanked over wide long-on after he charged down the track at Razzak. I didn&apos;t mean that to rhyme, but us lyrical poets can&apos;t always control our vibe. Bell then comes down the track to drive charmingly over extra-cover for four, and follows up with a straight drive high over Razzak&apos;s head for another boundary. &quot;I&apos;m considering challenging you to a duel re: the Walter Mitty comment, Smyth,&quot; says Dean Butler. &quot;We&apos;re literally a mile apart in our respective work places. Perhaps it could be staged on Hampstead Heath.&quot; If I could be bothered to do anything, I&apos;d consider thinking about contemplating this.  137th over: England 595-4 (Collingwood 145, Bell 80) Collingwood, on the charge, cleaves Shakib to cow corner for four and six from consecutive deliveries. &quot;A couple of questions for Dean Butler,&quot; says Phil Withall, before asking three questions. &quot;Does he include Zimbabwe as a Test-playing nation, has he just turned over having &apos;knocked off&apos; another one and how does he fare at the one-day teams?&quot;  WICKET! England 596-5 (Collingwood c Tamim Iqbal b Razzak 145) Collingwood tries to reach his 150 in the grand manner but only holes out to long off, where Tamim Iqbal takes a good running catch.  138th over: England 597-5 (Bell 82, Prior 0) Prior, cutting at Razzak, is dropped by this sadly inept wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim. I can&apos;t remember a worse wicketkeeper at this level. &quot;I&apos;d like to put forward my credentials in the loser stakes,&quot; announces Sanjay Ziddi. &quot;I&apos;m Indian, living in the States, and yet here I am awake when I should be asleep or at a club somewhere, following the OBO for a test match featuring two countries I&apos;ve never been to on one window, while trying (and failing miserably) to win the T20 World Cup at Stick Cricket as Scotland on another. I need HELP!&quot;  WICKET! England 599-6 declared (Bell c Rubel Hossain b Shakib Al Hasan 84) Two balls after dropping Bell at long off, Rubel Hossain takes a wonderfully nonchalant running catch in the same position. And with that comes the declaration. England will have half an hour at Bangladesh before tea.  INNINGS BREAK  Andrew Stroud is a loser He says so, and when you read this you won&apos;t disagree.  &quot;We&apos;ve all watched cricket scores updating slowly via Ceefax. Well, my claim for loser status is the Ashes 98-99, early days of Internet, specifically the Adelaide Test. I was working in Rio at the time, and remember sitting up through the early hours monitoring Cricinfo as the fifth day started. Could we expect an epic batting effort from Ramps &amp; Stewie to save or even win the game? The inexplicable absence of Ceefax on Brazilian TV meant I was forced to sit up thorough the night, hunched over the refresh button, on a dial-up connection, in my tiny flat, watching at first with joy, then being unable to tear my eyes away as it all went wrong... If that doesn&apos;t qualify, how about the fact that I&apos;m writing this listening to TMS, instead of changing the nappy of my week old son and future England opening bowler? Or the vicarious thrill I get whenever Andrew Strauss plays well, because if you don&apos;t listen that carefully, it might almost be me getting that ton...&quot;   1st over: Bangladesh 4-0 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 4, Imrul Kayes 0) Stuart Broad, the senior seamer for the first time in his Test career, opens the bowling and sees his first ball cut swaggeringly past point for four by Tamim Iqbal. He&apos;ll be a lot of fun to watch in this series, and over the next 10-15 years. &quot;Today&apos;s a good day,&quot; says Neil Tague. &quot;Yes, I&apos;m working on a Saturday morning, but how many other readers picked up a hardback copy of Brightly Fades the Don for peanuts from their local Oxfam yesterday? That spells winner to me. Or maybe I need to get out more.&quot;  2nd over: Bangladesh 8-0 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 4, Imrul Kayes 4) As expected, it&apos;ll be Bresnan rather than Finn to share the new ball. A pretty accurate over is ruined by a dismal wide half-volley that Imrul Kayes square-drives over the top for four. No swing for Bresnan, and the (very) early signs are that wickets won&apos;t come easily for England.  WICKET! Bangladesh 13-1 (Imrul Kayes c Prior b Broad 4) Stuart Broad roughs up Imrul Kayes with the minimum of fuss. It took just three consecutive short balls to get him. The first flew off the grille for four leg-byes; the second was gloved down uncomfortably; and the third prompted a desperate hook stroke, with the ball looping up for Prior to take a routine catch down the leg side. That&apos;s good, ruthless work from Broad and England.  3rd over: Bangladesh 13-1 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 5, Junaid Siddique 0) Broad greets Junaid Siddique with two pretty good short balls, both of which really carried through to Prior. As Bob Willis says, I&apos;d get Finn on him and have this sort of attack from both ends.  4th over: Bangladesh 14-1 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 5, Junaid Siddique 0) An accurate but harmless over from Bresnan. It&apos;s not swinging, so I&apos;d get him straight off and get Finn on. &quot;What&apos;s the point of Bangladesh playing international cricket if they are learning at this glacial pace?&quot; asks Gary Naylor. They won more Tests in their first decade than Sri Lanka. (Yes, I know they played more games too, but it shows they are not that far short of where we might expect a side to be after 10 years.)  5th over: Bangladesh 22-1 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 10, Junaid Siddique 3) Siddique gets off the mark with a pleasant push through mid-off for three and then Tamim cuts in front of square for four with a flourish. &quot;Incorrect with your prediction of no easy wickets Smyth,&quot; challenges Dean Butler. &quot;I&apos;m finishing work so goodnight by the way. It was as ever fun (the OBO not work).&quot; Now I know you&apos;re making things up.  6th over: Bangladesh 26-1 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 10, Junaid Siddique 7) Bresnan beats Siddique with a fine delivery that gripped off the seam and roared past his attempted forcing stroke. Siddique&apos;s response is an uppish drive that bounces just short of the diving Carberry at point before shooting away for four.  WICKET! Bangladesh 27-2 (Junaid Siddique ct and b Broad 7) This is too easy. Broad digs in a short one on leg stump and Siddique, looking completely the other way, gloves it up in the air for Broad to take a simple return catch. Excellent stuff from Broad but Siddique did not have a solitary clue. Harmison helped himself to some very cheap wickets here six winters ago and now Broad is doing the same.  6.5 overs: Bangladesh 27-2 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 11) The players took an early tea after that dismissal.  TEA  7th over: Bangladesh 27-2 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 11, Aftab Ahmed 0) Broad bowls the final delivery of the over he started before tea. Aftab Ahmed ducks underndeath a short one. &quot;Could you plug the Cambridge Science Festival for me please?&quot; says Niall Taylor. &quot;I am volunteering there today, joining the ranks of your followers who do energetic things for nothing. It is free, so broadly charitable, and I&apos;m missing the final session for it.&quot;  8th over: Bangladesh 33-2 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 16, Aftab Ahmed 0) Tamim cracks Bresnan through the covers for four more.  9th over: Bangladesh 39-2 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 22, Aftab Ahmed 0) A wonderful shot from Tamim, who helps a short ball from Broad all the way over fine leg for six. Then he keeps the strike with a single off the last delivery.  10th over: Bangladesh 49-2 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 31, Aftab Ahmed 1) I lost my entry for that over I&apos;m afraid, but all it really involved was two handsome boundaries for Tamim off Bresnan.  11th over: Bangladesh 50-2 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 32, Aftab Ahmed 1) A few technical problems. Sorry about this.  WICKET! Bangladesh 51-3 (Aftab Ahmed c Bell b Swann 1) Graeme Swann strikes in his first over yet again. It really is extraordinary how often he does that. Aftab tried to play a lap-sweep, but the ball only looped to Bell, who had run round from short leg in anticipation of the sweep. Aftab looked very unhappy with the decision although I haven&apos;t seen any replays yet.  12th over: Bangladesh 51-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 32, Mahmudullah 0) Replays weren&apos;t really conclusive with regard to that Aftab dismissal. It certainly went off the pad and straight to Bell; it&apos;s just a matter of whether it touched the glove on the way through. I don&apos;t think it did.  13rd over: Bangladesh 59-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 40, Mahmudullah 0) Finn replaces Broad and starts with a poor delivery on leg stump that Tamim Iqbal whips very fine for four. His third ball is a fraction too full and worked classily through midwicket to the fence, but he responds well by beating Tamim with one slanted across him. &quot;Can we have a few Crowded House references for the big Finn, please?&quot; says John Starbuck. Knock yourself out.  14th over: Bangladesh 66-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 41, Mahmudullah 5) Mahmudullah goes for an unseemly sweep at Swann but gets away with the resulting LBW shout by virtue of being well outside the line. A push-driven four through extra-cover next ball gets him off the mark in fine style.  15th over: Bangladesh 75-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 42, Mahmudullah 14) Mahmudullah takes consecutive boundaries off Finn, both to third man. So Finn&apos;s first two overs have gone for 17. &quot;Sadly Selectadisc in Nottingham closed down a few years ago,&quot; says Paul King. &quot;There was talk of it reopening but don&apos;t think it has. However anyone in the East Midlands&apos; second city should visit the extraordinary Rob&apos;s Records if they get a chance.&quot;  16th over: Bangladesh 77-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 43, Mahmudullah 15) Mahmudullah has started very positively and sweeps Swann for a single the ball after smashing a straight drive back at him on the bounce. Then Tamim completely misses a big sweep shot. &quot;Crowded House song would have to be Chocolate Cake, their tribute to TMS,&quot; says Phil Withall.  17th over: Bangladesh 85-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 50, Mahmudullah 16) Finn&apos;s expensive start continues with a leg-stump delivery that Tamim Iqbal tickles fine to reach a hugely entertaining fifty from only 53 balls. &quot;I&apos;m here and reckon it definitely hit the glove,&quot; says Anthony Hulse of Aftab Ahmed&apos;s dismissal. &quot;Watching the slo-mo you can see the red bit on the end of the glove is clearly pushed back by the ball. Not so clear in the super close up, but very obvious in the normal one.&quot;  18th over: Bangladesh 88-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 52, Mahmudullah 17) &quot;Operation Dirtbox!&quot; shouts one of the England fielders between overs. I don&apos;t want to know. These two are playing very nicely and, along with Shakib, are probably Bangladesh&apos;s best batsmen. &quot;Oi! Where do you get off calling my home town the second city of the East Midlands?&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;You need to be very careful discussing local sensibilities. Brum is the second city of England, yes, but Nottingham is first in the east and generally known as The Queen of the Midlands. Derby, Leicester, Lincoln? Pah!&quot; That wasn&apos;t me!  19th over: Bangladesh 90-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 52, Mahmudullah 19) Bresnan replaces Finn, whose three overs cost 25. Bresnan really should be meat and drink on this pitch. Saying which, his second ball is a beauty which seams away just enough to beat Mahmudullah&apos;s defensive grope. That really was a jaffa. &quot;I&apos;m sure everyone will be pleased to learn that I have now returned from work to my exclusive north London residence and am now sipping a chilled beer,&quot; says Dean Butler. I&apos;ve often wondered about booze etiquette when you work nights. I got a very funny look or 12 when I wearily tucked into a can of cider one morning on the train home during the last Ashes series in Australia.  20th over: Bangladesh 98-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 60, Mahmudullah 19) Swann will probably bowl through from this end now. What turn he is getting is very slow. The lack of bounce means that Tamim can sweep confidently from outside off stump, as he does for four twice in that over. The second brings him to 1000 Test runs. He&apos;s not even 21 yet, so you wouldn&apos;t be surprised if he reaches 10000 one day. &quot;We&apos;re listening in Tokyo,&quot; says Mark Hiratsuka. &quot;No, really - my son (three today) and I are following the OBO by mobile from a park in the west of the heaving metropolis. At least I am - he seems more interested in a smallish snake passing by...&quot; Many happy returns to Hiratsuka the younger.  21st over: Bangladesh 103-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 61, Mahmudullah 23) Mahmudullah pushes Bresnan really nicely through the covers for three; he looks a good player, this fellow. &quot;I&apos;m an American studying in Canada who just came in from a night out and your updates are a nice fix in lieu of tobacco,&quot; says Alison Jakobovic. &quot;In consideration of my lungs, please keep up with them as I&apos;m sure there are other people in my position who are appreciating them just as much, if not for quite the same reason. Also, I really hope Steven Finn lives up to his potential. It would be lovely to have him and Broad leading the attack for the next five years... yes I am shallow. But I&apos;m young. It&apos;s allowed.&quot;  22nd over: Bangladesh 103-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 61, Mahmudullah 23) Mahmudullah, pushing nervously, drags Swann&apos;s quicker ball into his back foot. That could easily have hit the stumps. An excellent maiden from Swann, full of variety. &quot;I think I would have shot a stranger a startled glance if I spotted them necking cider at 7am on the train,&quot; says Tom van der Gucht. &quot;I think, unfortunately, as a drink it has trampish connotations and conjures up images of desperados drinking to forget their sorry existences. However if you had been wearing a dinner jacket and were chugging from a bottle of Verve Clique people may have considered you something of a 13th Duke of Wymbourne cad and smiled whimsically at your roguishness whilst secretly envying your all-night frivolities.&quot; It was Marks &amp; Spencer cider, so at least I was a classyish tramp.  23rd over: Bangladesh 110-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 68, Mahmudullah 23) Tamim Iqbal steers Bresnan carefully wide of Collingwood at second slip and away for four. Then he has an almighty leaden-footed yahoo at a short one, meeting only fresh air.  24th over: Bangladesh 115-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 69, Mahmudullah 27) &quot;Come on Avatar!&quot; shouts one of the England fielders. Fat lot of good it did, because Mahmudullah drove the next ball from Swann through extra-cover for four. Bangladesh are rattling along at more than 4.5 runs per over.  25th over: Bangladesh 117-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 70, Mahmudullah 27) Bresnan goes around the wicket to Tamim Iqbal, who moves into the seventies with the aid of a slight misfield from Kevin Pietersen. &quot;Apart from the answer &apos;Because that&apos;s his new nickname,&apos; does anyone know why Matt Prior keeps calling Graeme Swann &quot;Avatar&apos;?&quot; asks Anthony Pease.  26th over: Bangladesh 124-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 70, Mahmudullah 35) A brilliant stroke from Mahmudullah, who dances down the track to Swann and drives him for a handsome straight six. He looks a very accomplished young batsman. &quot;As you have worked a night you can test your etiquette on home soil by having a can of cider whilst walking through Kings Cross when you leave work,&quot; says Dean Butler. &quot;Oh hang on half the people in the streets in Kings Cross will also be drinking cider in the morning.&quot;  27th over: Bangladesh 134-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 70, Mahmudullah 45) Mahmudullah carries on his merry way, flashing Bresnan behind point for four and then pulling him emphatically for four more. Shot! &quot;As you have worked a night you can test your etiquette on home soil by having a can of cider whilst walking through Kings Cross when you leave work,&quot; says Dean Butler. &quot;Oh hang on, half the people in the streets in Kings Cross will also be drinking cider in the morning.&quot;  28th over: Bangladesh 140-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 71, Mahmudullah 50) England are suddenly hemmorhaging runs. Mahmudallah sweeps Swann fine for four to move to 49 and then takes a single to reach an extremely good half-century from 54 balls.  29th over: Bangladesh 145-3 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 75, Mahmudullah 51) Broad replaces the ineffective Bresnan (10-1-47-0) and Tamim opens the face to guide him for four. Ten overs to go, and counting.  WICKET! Bangladesh 145-4 (Mahmudullah c Collingwood b Swann 51) Mahmudullah&apos;s excellent innings comes to an end in tame fashion with a gloved sweep that loops straight to Collingwood at first slip. No argument that time, and that&apos;s the end of a fine partnership of 94 in 18 overs.  30th over: Bangladesh 145-4 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 75, Shakib Al Hasan 0) A wicket maiden for Swann.  31st over: Bangladesh 146-4 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 76, Shakib Al Hasan 0) Broad immediately bombs Shakib Al Hasan with short stuff, all of which he defends well. There are another eight overs to go.  32nd over: Bangladesh 147-4 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 77, Shakib Al Hasan 0) &quot;Come on boys, the original two men on nought fellas!&quot; shouts one of the England fielders. Quite why this would be the original I have no idea. Anyway, Tamim scuppers the plan by getting off strike, leaving Shakib to defend the remainder of Swann&apos;s over.  33rd over: Bangladesh 148-4 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 77, Shakib Al Hasan 0) Broad has a biggish shout for LBW against Tamim but it was clearly sliding down leg from around the wicket. Broad has been sharp today.  34th over: Bangladesh 148-4 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 77, Shakib Al Hasan 0) Tamim, who looks to be playing for the close now, defends solidly in that over from Swann. A maiden.  35th over: Bangladesh 149-4 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 77, Shakib Al Hasan 1) Shakib is beaten by a good delivery from Broad that was too close for the cut stroke he was attempting, but he gets off the mark next ball with a work to midwicket. Tamim is then beaten by a real peach that seamed and lifted. That really was a marvellous leg-cutter, a mirror image of the sort Jason Gillespie used to bowl to right-handers in his pomp.  36th over: Bangladesh 149-4 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 77, Shakib Al Hasan 1) A maiden from Swann to the near strokeless Shakib, whose sole intention is to be at the crease tomorrow morning. Three overs to go.  37th over: Bangladesh 149-4 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 77, Shakib Al Hasan 1) A smart move from Alastair Cook, who has decided to give Steve Finn two overs while Bangladesh are batting for the close. The first of them, to Tamim Iqbal, is a maiden.  WICKET! Bangladesh 149-5 (Shakib Al Hasan b Swann 1) This is a stunning piece of bowling. Having almost bowled Shakib with the previous delivery, a quicker one that kept low, he lured Shakib forward into the drive with a tantalising piece of flight, and the ball turned sharply from middle stump to hit the top of off. High-class spin bowling, even if it wasn&apos;t a great stroke just before the close, and a big breakthrough for England in the penultimate over of the day.  38th over: Bangladesh 149-5 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 77, Shahadat Hossain 0) The nightwatchman Shahadat Hossain survives a long, long referral to the third umpire for a catch at silly point via bat and boot. It was an odd one: from behind the wicket it definitely looked out, but from in front it looked equally certain that it had hit the ground. The third umpire could not be absolutely certain that it was out, so it was the right decision.  39th over: Bangladesh 154-5 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 81, Shahadat Hossain 0) That&apos;s the end of another good day for England, who are set fair for an innings victory despite a very fine innings from Tamim Iqbal.

See you tomorrow.", "publicationDate": "2010-03-13T01:00:00Z", "tags": ["England in Bangladesh 2010", "Bangladesh Cricket Team", "England cricket team", "Over by over reports", "Cricket", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/mar/12/bangladesh-england-live-cricket", "title": "Bangladesh v England - day two as it happened | Rob Smyth", "sentences": ["&quot;Given that it is 10am in Bangkok, I am at a slight advantage,&quot; says Paul Sumner.", "There is not a lot else to do as Bangkok is supposed to be brought to a standstill by protesters this weekend."]}, {"article": " Preamble Morning. In modern times, one of England&apos;s main problems has been their inability to take 20 wickets in five days, yet it&apos;s entirely feasible that they will take 15 wickets in a single day at Chittagong today and thus wrap up the first Test with 48 hours to spare. Bangladesh resume on 154 for five, a deficit of 445, with all their eggs in the basket marked &apos;Tamim Iqbal&apos;. He made 81 not out, a frequently spectacular innings, but Bangladesh are still 246 runs away from avoiding the follow-on. If they save this game, I&apos;ll do any forfeit you like.  Play starts at 3.30am, Greenwich Mean Etc. Until then, I&apos;m watching two grown men punch each other in the face for a living.  Kill some time by looking up an essentially meaningless stat department Graeme Swann needs seven of the remaining 15 wickets to become the first English offspinner to take a ten-for since Jim Laker&apos;s astonishing 19-wicket haul against Australia in 1956, and the first to take one overseas since Billy Bates, 117 years ago. In fact only three English spinners of any type have taken a ten-for in the last 50 years: Monty Panesar, Nick Cook and professional Don Corleone impersonator Phil Tufnell, whose performance at Christchurch in 1991-92 \u2013 including frankly sexual second-innings figures of 46.1-25-47-7 \u2013 promised so much more than his career would ultimately deliver, even if there was another memorable ten-wicket haul against Australia at The Oval in 1997.  Encouraging words from Luke Dealtry &quot;Good morning Rob. I&apos;m going to bed now. Enjoy the night shift. Snooze snooze snooze etc etc etc says me. Good luck I&apos;m so tired. Don&apos;t sleep!&quot;  40th over: Bangladesh 154-5 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 81, Shahadat Hossain 0) I thought England might open up with their best bowlers, Broad and Swann, but here&apos;s Bresnan, shambling in to bowl to the nightwatchman Shahadat Hossain. He is beaten by the second and third deliveries, and it&apos;s a maiden. &quot;What, any forfeit?&quot; says Jessie Greengrass. &quot;Because I know it seems unlikely but that sounds like the sort of offer that could backfire to the extent of not only bringing humiliation but bringing blame for hubris. I&apos;m so tired that I just want to have a little weep.&quot; You lot are full of F.U.N. this morning.  41st over: Bangladesh 159-5 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Tamim Iqbal 86, Shahadat Hossain 0) Stuart Broad, who was excellent yesterday, goes straight around the wicket to Tamim Iqbal. He has a man out at deep cover right from the off, but he can&apos;t get round when Tamim checks a cut stroke to third man for four. Good stroke. &quot;Phil Sawyer here,&quot; says Phil Sawyer. &quot;Tonight I&apos;m not only trying to stay awake for some Test cricket but also for the Pacquiao fight. So tonight I absolutely promise to keep you company and not fall asleep with my head on the keyboarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.&quot;  WICKET! Bangladesh 159-6 (Tamim Iqbal b Bresnan 86) That&apos;s why Tim Bresnan&apos;s bowling: he has just cleaned Tamim Iqbal up with a sensational delivery! From around the wicket, it landed on off stump and then seamed away sharply to hit the top of off as Tamim squirted defensively. He looks shell-shocked. Any bowler in the history of the game would have been proud of that delivery. It really was a jaffa. You could even hear one of the England fielders chuckling in disbelief: &quot;That&apos;s a beauty&quot;. Damn straight.  42nd over: Bangladesh 159-6 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Shahadat Hossain 0, Mushfiqur Rahim 0) One down, 14 to go. That Sunday-night snoreathon is looking pretty good from here. Come on England!  43rd over: Bangladesh 163-6 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Shahadat Hossain 4, Mushfiqur Rahim 0) Shahadat fends off a good short one from Broad, but he was far from comfortable. He ducks under the next ball and then thinks, sod this, cleaving another short one through mid-off for the most enjoyably rustic of boundaries. &quot;Ventured out last night despite the protests (up to about 80,000 people now) and watched Ireland vs Wales, which was very good (free flowing and largely error free),&quot; says Paul Sumner. &quot;Managed to avoid Scotland vs England, which apparently was dire. Feeling good this morning, as Bangkok has run out of Guinness so I didn&apos;t pay through the noise for my drinks and I actually got a decent sleep. Off for a swim and then check back on the scores. Given your seeming pleasure in adversity and misery, the forfeit should probably be something joyous. We could send you to do a song by song report of a Whitney Houston concert, but you would probably take a perverse pleasure in that.&quot; And probably shed a sly tear during &apos;Didn&apos;t We Almost Have It All?&apos;  44th over: Bangladesh 163-6 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Shahadat Hossain 4, Mushfiqur Rahim 0) There&apos;s a bit of reverse for Bresnan, and Mushfiqur leaves one that doesn&apos;t miss his off stump by all that much. A maiden. England have the scent. Just 14 to go lads. Come on England! &quot;Some of us are sticking with you, Rob,&quot; says Peter Hanes. &quot;Although in my case it&apos;s mostly because I&apos;m watching Ottawa v Vancouver in the NHL ice hockey tonight. For what it&apos;s worth, Vancouver are 1-0 up (powerplay goal) near the end of the first period.&quot; My knowledge of NHL, sadly, starts and finishes here.  45th over: Bangladesh 167-6 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Shahadat Hossain 8, Mushfiqur Rahim 0) Shahadat mows Broad through mid-off for four again, so Broad thinks, sod this and goes around the wicket. I like Broad&apos;s nasty streak. And his brain, too: after one delivery from around the wicket he switches back over and has Shahadat ducking under a bouncer. Then he goes back around the wicket again. Good stuff. &quot;Just reading CLR James&apos;s Cricket and came across a piece on George Headley that reminded me of Cook&apos;s dismissal yesterday,&quot; says Craig Burley. &quot;The great Headley is speaking to James:   &apos;In a Test match be on guard against the bad ball.&apos; Somewhat bewildered, I asked him why. He said that in the tight play of a Test when a really bad ball comes, you go at it so greedily that you can make a bad stroke and get out.&apos;  I just thought it interesting, coming from one of the all time great batsmen and all.&quot; Generally I agree that the insights of truly great players are to be cherished; against that, Shane Warne did recently say this:  Getting up in the morning and putting on a pair of underpants is important for me. And I think a lot of people think like that.   46th over: Bangladesh 171-6 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Shahadat Hossain 8, Mushfiqur Rahim 4) Mushfiqur cuts Bresnan for four to get off the mark. &quot;The new Curtly Ambrose isn&apos;t going to Finn-ish with a five-for,&quot; says Liam Drew, &quot;is he?&quot; The short answer&apos;s &apos;no&apos;, and I think the long one is as well.  47th over: Bangladesh 172-6 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Shahadat Hossain 8, Mushfiqur Rahim 4) Ah, Sky have Mark Butcher in the commentary box, on loan from TMS to cover for the ill David Lloyd. Get well soon Bumble! He has a good cricket brain, Butcher, and could make a good commentator. Anyway, Shahadat ducks into a bouncer from Broad, which rams into the back of his helmet and away for a leg-bye. &quot;I&apos;ve just had a special moment (no, not that kind of special moment - the court injunctions have taken care of that),&quot; says Phil Sawyer. &quot;I can&apos;t, in all my time following England, ever remember their opponents needing to score 400 to avoid the follow on. Okay, it&apos;s against Bangladesh, but it&apos;s only fifteen years or so since David Lloyd claimed that when we&apos;d drawn with Zimbabwe we&apos;d &apos;flippin murdered them&apos;. I&apos;m finding this new not outrageously talented but unsettlingly efficient England a bit disconcerting.&quot; You might want to check your funky-cheese consumption, Phil: the last instance was last year. However, it is pretty rare: it only happened once between 1979 and 2009, and has only occurred 11 times in all. Still, we invented the game, so well done us. Did we even invent it? Whatever. Well done England!  48th over: Bangladesh 176-6 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Shahadat Hossain 12, Mushfiqur Rahim 4) A strange incident here: Bresnan rammed it a short one that Shahadat touched through to the leaping Prior. Rod Tucker gave him out \u2013 but as he was raising his finger Prior dropped the ball. Rod Tucker&apos;s desperate to get this game done today so he can settle down for a 48-hour Murder, She Wrote marathon. I know his game. To compound the confusion, it almost certainly came off Shahadat&apos;s arm guard rather than his glove. Good delivery, mind. Bresnan is probably better than most people think \u2013 sharper and smarter \u2013 but I still can&apos;t see him making it as a Test cricketer. That said, in 36 hours&apos; time he&apos;ll have won more Tests in three attempts than Graham Dilley did in 41. Weird. &quot;Did Warne go on to specify whose underpants?&quot; asks Marie Meyer. Oh Lord, look at this photo. (It&apos;s safe for work, if maybe not your stomach.)  49th over: Bangladesh 177-6 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Shahadat Hossain 12, Mushfiqur Rahim 4) Finn replaces Broad, who bowled a malevolent short spell. It&apos;s a range-finding first over, mostly outside off stump but with a bye down the leg side from the final delivery. &quot;England&apos;s new fast bowler needs a nickname,&quot; says Marie Meyer. &quot;You would think it would be a toss-up between Finns and Finny. But no! Collingwood tweets that &quot;Para&quot;, &quot;Cough&quot; and &quot;Muff&quot; are all being considered.&quot; Collingwood&apos;s on Twitter? Disappointing. I thought he was better than that. The strawberry-blond community will have to consider ostracism.  50th over: Bangladesh 181-6 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Shahadat Hossain 12, Mushfiqur Rahim 8) Mushfiqur, feeling tentatively outside off stump, snicks Bresnan right through the vacant third-slip area for four. Some Aussie has apparently produced statistics to show that 40 per cent of Test runs come to third man. That sounds pretty unlikely, but if true it does make you wonder what the bloody hell is going off out there in terms of field placings \u2013 not so much today for the last 123 years. Anyway here&apos;s Dean Butler, back at work and spreading the depression. &quot;This is like WW1. Everyone just wants it to be over.&quot; Do you ever not work?  WICKET! Bangladesh 183-7 (Shahadat c Collingwood b Finn 14) A lovely moment for 20-year-old Steven Finn, who gets his first Test wicket. Shahadat, the nightwatchman, was backing away all the time and simply edged a good, shortish delivery delivery to second slip.  51st over: Bangladesh 183-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 8, Naeem Islam 0) Shahadat backs away towards square leg and smears Finn over point for a couple. &quot;Morning from Nairobi, where it&apos;s another clear blue day with a hint of a breeze, and I&apos;m about to travel 200 miles to look at a biogas plant run on waste from the latrines of Kenya&apos;s biggest prison,&quot; says Martin Wright. &quot;Most people come to Kenya to look at lions, I come to look at shit. Which is just so preferable. So - can Bangladesh stay out of the slurry this morning?&quot; Apparently not. Just 13 left now. Come on England!  52nd over: Bangladesh 183-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 8, Naeem Islam 0) Graeme Swann replaces Tim Bresnan. Mark Butcher accidentally uses the phrase &quot;spinger fin&quot;. It&apos;s a maiden to Mushfiqur Rahim, prompting Smyth to wrestle internally with whether it&apos;s now passe to jokily refer to Swann not taking a wicket in his first over shock horror LOL. &quot;Ah, that&apos;s my OBO credentials gone up in smoke then,&quot; says Phil Sawyer. &quot;Had forgotten the Windies snore-a-thon. In my defence, I was thinking more of not remembering England being in a winning position with their opponents needing 400 to avoid the follow on rather than a non-event of a competition on a flat track. Also it&apos;s 4.15 am and I&apos;m surprised I can remember my own name, let alone the results of matches gone by.&quot; Forgetting that West Indies series is fair enough. I needed professional treatment to open my eyelids after that.  53rd over: Bangladesh 183-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 8, Naeem Islam 0) Finn hits the bat hard, as you&apos;d expect of someone so tall, and Naeem Islam pushes one on the bounce to fourth slip. Finn then has him swaying away from a good bouncer. He is in a nice groove now after that difficult start yesterday. A maiden, and drinks. &quot;Cook should let Prior have a spell,&quot; says Scott W. &quot;Let him get his first Test wicket. Only fair.&quot;  54th over: Bangladesh 188-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 13, Naeem Islam 0) &quot;Eight and nine then lads!&quot; chirps Matt Prior, showing a wonderful ability to count. England have been very loud and playful in the field. Swann has a short leg, silly point and slip for Mushfiqur, who runs down the track and drives over Carberry at mid-on for four. It wasn&apos;t a slightly iffy stroke but he just got enough on it.  55th over: Bangladesh 188-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 13, Naeem Islam 0) Finn finishes another maiden with a peach of a lifting leg-cutter that squares Mushfiqur up and beats the outside edge. The raw materials are certainly there, but then we knew that anyway. &quot;Morning Rob!&quot; says Niall Harden. &quot;Flip, I&apos;ve got up at some stupid times for some stupid reasons but this really wins. I&apos;ve got loserball to play! (03/04 Angel 18 Aston Villa home shirt freshly laundered of course). Going to fall asleep at half time and blame you. It&apos;ll be etc etc. By the way, you get yr iPod working? Tried switching it off and on again?&quot; Arf. Well I finally managed to restore it after two weeks of trying. Sadly I then couldn&apos;t get iTunes to recognise it, so now it has no music on it. That meant I had to endure the full noise of the night bus, including three Germans singing a song about sodomy and an ageing man with a Cornish accent telling a friend on the phone how he had got a Chinese man so drunk on two pints that &quot;he nearly fell off the barstool&quot;. London, it&apos;s the world&apos;s coolest city!  56th over: Bangladesh 190-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 13, Naeem Islam 2) Hello.  57th over: Bangladesh 194-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 17, Naeem Islam 2) A fine, reverse-swinging yorker from Finn is fortuitously inside-edged for four by Mushfiqur. That only just missed leg stump. Finn is mixing his length up nicely, getting a bit of reverse and hitting the bat very hard. His last delivery is another reverse-swinging yorker that rams into Mushfiqur&apos;s pad. It was going down but that was a very good over. Tall fast bowlers really do make us English cricket suffererers go all a-quiver. &quot;If Bangladesh save it you could shutter your bedroom Martin McCague shrine for a full week,&quot; says J. David Moore. &quot;That should strike most of your readers as sufficiently wrenching for you to match the enormity of what would be Bangladesh&apos;s achievement (or England&apos;s pipe-taking, whichever way you look at it).&quot;  58th over: Bangladesh 198-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 17, Naeem Islam 6) Classy stuff from Naeem Islam, who glides Swann to third man for four. &quot;It raises some issues this Test,&quot; says Dean Butler, referring specificially to the state of his life, and mine. &quot;I&apos;ve been annoyed by all those who&apos;ve been ranting on about Bangladesh Test status yet again. I&apos;ve always thought it was really worthwhile to try and gain another Test nation. Certainly one with such a large population. A better bet than Zimbabwe I feel. However with Test cricket currently grappling for a means of long-term survival in it&apos;s battle with the younger, fitter, meaner rapacious beast that is Twenty20 this kind of match isn&apos;t really helping is it? Because this is a futile clusterfuck.&quot; Thing is, I am quite stupid, but I genuinely don&apos;t see a viable alternative to shoving a team into Test cricket and watching them get bullied for a decade or two before they eventually become better than England. With the partial exception of Pakistan, that has been the case ever since South Africa became the third Test-playing nation, no?  59th over: Bangladesh 203-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 18, Naeem Islam 9) Finn starts his sixth over, which is a fair spell in this heat. Again he so nearly gets a reverse-swinging yorker through; this time it was Naeem Islam who jabbed his bat down desperately, with the ball shooting off the inside-edge for four. So: it&apos;s tall, it gets bounce and seam, it seems temperamentally sound and it bowls reverse-swinging yorkers. Permission to get ridiculously carried away and envision a career haul of 547 Test wickets at 24.77? &quot;It&apos;s a bit of a disappointment that Pacquiao&apos;s entrance music is Eye of the Tiger,&quot; says Phil Sawyer. &quot;You&apos;d hope for something more original from such a great of the game. Yes, I know that this is nothing to do with cricket but in the absence of an MBM boxing blog you&apos;re going to have to put up with it. I imagine your hands are already directing the mouse towards the &apos;mark this address as junk mail&apos; option.&quot; Beggars, choosers. If Ian Bell was a boxer, what might he enter the ring to?  60th over: Bangladesh 212-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 27, Naeem Islam 9) Swann hasn&apos;t bowled particularly well today by his standards, and Mushfiqur cuts a short one classily for four. He is sufficiently emboldened to give the next ball the charge and drive it over Swann&apos;s head for another boundary. Well played. &quot;Bad news from the hockey,&quot; wails Peter Hanes. &quot;The Ottawa Senators did well to only be 1-0 down after one period, having being outshot 17-2. The Sens&apos; centre Jason Spezza scored a typically sublime solo equaliser, but Ottawa then kept giving up the puck tamely and are now 4-1 down at the end of the second period. Hopeless.&quot; Can someone translate?  61st over: Bangladesh 216-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 31, Naeem Islam 9) After a good six-over spell, Steven Finn takes a break and is replaced by Stuart Broad, presumably with a remit to end this nonsense and ensure I get tomorrow night off. But Mushfiqur is playing nicely now and drives Broad&apos;s first delivery on the up through the coverse for four. That was a really pretty stroke. &quot;&apos;Grappling for a means of long-term survival&apos; (58th over) - what bollocks,&quot; says Scott W. &quot;Whoever says a vibrant Test scene and a thriving IPL are mutually exclusive has been fooled by the grumpy brigade. Both are brilliant. I&apos;d construct an argument but I&apos;m too tired and this Test isn&apos;t helping. Just accept I&apos;m right and move on to worrying about David Cameron. Now that&apos;s scary.&quot;  62nd over: Bangladesh 216-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 31, Naeem Islam 9) A maiden from Swann to Naeem Islam, who is defending pretty solidly. Bob Willis, who knows a thing or two about the subject, is saying some interesting things about Finn&apos;s development, chiefly that he must maintain and maybe increase his current pace rather than be coerced into sacrifing speed in pursuit of greater accuracy. &quot;It&apos;s true what you say,&quot; says Dean Butler, confirming the long-held suspicion that I am always right, &quot;except I&apos;m beginning to feel that another 10 years of getting kicked around the play ground may not be available due to the effects of Twenty20. Even I enjoyed the previous Twenty20 World Cup and I&apos;m a luddite who insists upon calling the English football divisions by their correct name such as 2nd/3rd division etc. We&apos;re all doomed.&quot;  63rd over: Bangladesh 223-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 38, Naeem Islam 9) Broad is trying a bit of off-theory against Mushfiqur, who likes a cover-drive but who, as yet, has not been tempted to chase a wide one. Broad has a good brain for bowling on the subcontinent, as he showed on the subcontinental pitches of the Caribbean in Phil Sawyer&apos;s favourite series this time last year. Eventually Broad digs in a shorter, slightly straight delivery that Mushfiqur mispulls in the air but wide of mid-on and away for four. &quot;You are right Rob,&quot; says Graham Mooney, confirming the long-held etc.. &quot;Mark Butcher will make a great commentator if he can come up with the imaginative nickname &apos;Spinger&apos; for Steven Finn (over 52). Expect a Tweet from Colly at lunch.&quot; Oh, Colly. I thought you were better than that.  64th over: Bangladesh 227-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 41, Naeem Islam 10) The increasingly fluent Mushfiqur drives Swann pleasantly for three. &quot;Wasn&apos;t a two-tier Test system touted by the ICC as a solution to your nightmare world?&quot; says Niall Harden. &quot;I suppose it opens up new, equally nightmarish possibilities but if Ashes Cricket 2009 for the Xbox 360 is anything to go by, Ireland are ready for anyone...&quot; At the risk of being boring and serious \u2013 because it&apos;s not all smiles and strap-ons round here, Harden\u00a0\u2013\u00a0I don&apos;t really see the point of a two-tier system. If you had, say, two tiers of six, the hardest games Bangladesh would currently play would be against New Zealand and West Indies, and I don&apos;t know how quickly they would develop by doing that.  65th over: Bangladesh 227-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 41, Naeem Islam 10) This game is snoozing towards lunch, so Bob Willis talks about his buttocks. Nobody needs that at 5.14am on a Sunday. He was referring to Ian Botham&apos;s calf muscles, which are apparently the size of Bob&apos;s aforementioneds. Broad very nearly slips a reverse-swinging yorker through Naeem Islam, who falls over towards the off side but just manages to get his bat down on it. A maiden. &quot;Music for Ian Bell entering the ring: My Boy Lollipop, perhaps?&quot; says Martin Wright. &quot;Or if he was feeling particularly plucky, how about What&apos;s New, Pussycat?...&quot;  66th over: Bangladesh 232-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 46, Naeem Islam 10) Swann has switched to around the wicket but that doesn&apos;t really bother Mushfiqur, who has a little dance down the track and lifts him nicely over midwicket for four. He has played really well, particularly when you factor in the pressure he must have felt to justify his place/existence following his horrific performance with the wicketkeeping gloves. &quot;Want me to call Collingwood a &apos;shithead&apos; and see if he storms off Twitter in a funk?&quot; miaows Niall Harden. &quot;Reckon he won&apos;t though, as he&apos;s a bloody bloke.&quot;  67th over: Bangladesh 232-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 46, Naeem Islam 10) They keep showing that Paddy Power advert. It was funny the first time and probably the second, but now I just feel unwell. Broad is replaced by Bresnan, who beats Mushfiqur with a snarling leg-cutter and beats him again with a fuller delivery later in the over. An excellent maiden.  68th over: Bangladesh 239-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 51, Naeem Islam 12) Naeem tucks Swann to leg for a single to bring a very responsible fifty partnership, and then Mushfiqur sweeps flat and hard for four to bring up a fine half-century, from 90 balls and with ten fours. &quot;Is it just me or do the crowd who cheer when Manny does something worthwhile sound like they have been shipped in from the audience of &apos;We are the Champions&apos;?&quot; wonders John Dalby.  69th over: Bangladesh 239-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 51, Naeem Islam 12) That&apos;s lunch, after a morning of hard yakka with the soft old ball for England. I&apos;m off for a restorative shower, so I&apos;ll leave you with this from Niall Harden. &quot;Bell&apos;s song has got to be something really muscular and threatening by, say, Belle &amp; Sebastian - The Boy Done Wrong Again, perhaps, or The State I Am In. TMS have lost the line to Bangladesh and it sounds like a random BBC fella is just sitting in a room in silence watching Sky, lamely describing what he can see. Imagine that, eh? Hoho!&quot; Yeah. Ho. Ho.  LUNCH  F.U.N. lunch quiz Since Graham Dilley in 1980, six bowlers have taken Test wickets for England before their 21st birthday. The sixth was Steven Finn, today. The first person to name the other five wins nothing, not even a surge of misplaced pride. No cheating now, I know where you live.  70th over: Bangladesh 240-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 52, Naeem Islam 13) Graeme Swann starts after lunch and Mushfiqur crunches him down the ground for a single. This could be a long afternoon for England, whose decision to omit James Tredwell is getting some deserved stick from Mark Butcher in the Sky commentary box. &quot;England won&apos;t enforce the follow on, and not because Bangladesh will get 400 nor because it makes sense to bat again in this match, but because there&apos;s another Test coming up very soon indeed and the bowlers need a break,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;England&apos;s second innings will be largely superfluous in terms of the runs scored, so wouldn&apos;t it just make sense for England to fast forward the match and negotiate a target with Shakib \u2013 say 450 in four and a half sessions? Both captains will be happy with that and it&apos;ll take an unnecessary day out of the match for all of us.&quot; I&apos;m not so sure. I certainly reckon they would have enforced it had they cleaned Bangladesh up before lunch this morning.Ah that humble dream, of snoring violently throughout Sunday night, waking up at random intervals to catch a couple of 12-syllable laments from Dawson&apos;s Creek on the TV before drifting back into the deepest sleep, looks like it&apos;s dead already.  71st over: Bangladesh 241-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 52, Naeem Islam 12) It&apos;s light outside, or at least I think that&apos;s light I can see through the slits. Bresnan, who bowled very well indeed this morning, sends down a pretty anodyne over to Mushfiqur Rahim, an excellent reverse-inswinger excepted. With the new ball due in nine overs&apos; time, England could do worse than give Paul Collingwood a few overs of cutters. &quot;I support the Belle and Sebastian suggestion for Ian Bell,&quot; says Ben Taylor. &quot;There&apos;s a great song with the line &apos;It could have been a brilliant career&apos; very prominent.&quot; This would be my choice; it oozes menace.  72nd over: Bangladesh 242-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 53, Naeem Islam 13) Mushfiqur top-edges a sweep at Swann but it drops well short of Finn at deep backward square. &quot;Can&apos;t we just grant Test status to any nation with the desire, the resources and the infrastructure to put on a Test match? How hard can it be? Afghanistan, the Dutch, Canada, Greenland, anyone can have Test status provided they can host a five-day cricket match in which they take responsibility for one of the sides. Or is that just too straightforward? Far too democratic? Not self-defeating enough? The ICC should be more like me in a pub (bear with me here) - seize upon any expression of an interest in Test cricket with fervour and enthusiasm (and a free pint to begin with).&quot;  73rd over: Bangladesh 243-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 54, Naeem Islam 13) Bangladesh are in no hurry at all, and nor should they be really. England are struggling here and need the new ball.  74th over: Bangladesh 248-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 55, Naeem Islam 17) Swann drops a sharp return chance. Naeem Islam spanked a flighted delivery back whence it came and Swann, putting both hands above his left shoulder, let the ball go straight through his fingers and down the ground for four. That was, as return catches go, reasonably straightforward.  75th over: Bangladesh 248-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 55, Naeem Islam 17) Steven Finn comes on for Timothy Bresnan. He bowls a maiden to Mushfiqur Rahim. This is all. &quot;Aye that song&apos;s called It Could Have Been A Brilliant Career, good call,&quot; says Niall Harden. &quot;There&apos;s also A Century of Fakers and Your Cover&apos;s Blown. Plus, they&apos;re called BELLe and Sebastian!! I&apos;m sorry, I have no idea what is wrong with me.&quot;  76th over: Bangladesh 249-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 55, Naeem Islam 18) &quot;Wishing for a night off?&quot; asks Phil Sawyer. &quot;You need to take a leaf out of Gary Naylor&apos;s book. It seems he never sleeps. I imagine him in a Batcave-style underground bunker, multiple screens showing every sporting event in the world, hands poised over the keyboard ready to dispatch his latest missive to whichever unfortunate journo is in the firing line.&quot;  77th over: Bangladesh 255-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 55, Naeem Islam 24) That was a brilliant over from Finn. Twice Naeem Islam edged him through the slips, the first for two and the second for four, and inbetween he padded up to an inswinger that flew off the top of the bat handle \u2013 which was facing towards third man \u2013 and just missed the stumps. That was really fine bowling.  78th over: Bangladesh 261-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 60, Naeem Islam 25) Mushfiqur slog-sweeps Swann emphatically for a one-bounce four. As nobody can be bothered with my F.U.N quiz, here are the answers: Phil DeFreitas, Ben Hollioake, Andrew Flintoff, James Anderson and Liam Plunkett. I was slightly surprised that Alex Tudor wasn&apos;t on the list, but he turned 21 shortly before he waged war on the Waughs at Perth in 1998-99. &quot;Surely Ian Bell should enter to the Lobster Quadrille from Alice in Wonderland?&quot; suggests Richard Woods.  79th over: Bangladesh 262-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 60, Naeem Islam 26) One from Finn&apos;s over. His figures today are 9-5-18-1, which is a fair reflection of the control and threat with which he has bowled in trying circumstances. Here&apos;s an interesting(ish) stat: Test wickets taken by teenagers for each of the ten Test-playing nations. Pakistan are top, as you&apos;d expect, but can you guess which country is bottom of the list?  80th over: Bangladesh 265-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 61, Naeem Islam 28) Kevin Pietersen comes on to bowl what will presumably be the last over with the old ball. Nothing happens. &quot;Ah, The Field Mice,&quot; weeps Phil Podolsky. &quot;The nostalgia of, well... searching to death everything Saint Etienne-related back in the early noughties. Hardly the stuff of a rave extravaganza, is it... And in an entirely predictable turn of events, hug ma soul, Rob.&quot;  81st over: Bangladesh 270-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 65, Naeem Islam 28) England take the new ball at the first opportunity, and Paul Collingwood puts Mushfiqur down! It was an inviting delivery from Broad, full and in the slot outside off stump. Mushfiqur went for the drive and edged low to second slip, where Collingwood failed to hold on to a low chance. Broad yelps with frustration. For a fielder of Collingwood&apos;s ability that was pretty straightforward. Mushfiqur takes advantage of the reprieve to slap a boundary through the covers off the back foot. Broad&apos;s frustration manifests itself in a nasty final delivery that jams Mushfiqur&apos;s bottom hand against the bat handle.  82nd over: Bangladesh 270-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 65, Naeem Islam 28) Bresnan beats Naeem Islam with a nasty lifter, and suddenly it is a very different game. A maiden. &quot;There are in fact several Gary Naylors, the result of a cloning experiment gone wrong,&quot; says Phil Withall. &quot;These super inteligent beings have an answer for all sporting related questions and are owned by the major sporting bodies to keep OBO and MBM reporters in employment.&quot;  83rd over: Bangladesh 271-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 65, Naeem Islam 28) Broad&apos;s second over with the new ball is survived pretty comfortably. If Bangladesh can avoid the follow-on here \u2013 and Abdur Razzak, the No10, can bat a bit as well \u2013 they will have a real chance of saving this. England would probably want no less than four sessions to bowl them out in the fourth innings.  84th over: Bangladesh 271-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 65, Naeem Islam 28) Mushfiqur gets very solidly behind the line against Bresnan. He looks a very fine player, and averages over 40 in his last two years of Test cricket. Saying which, he goes for an airy-fairy hook at Bresnan and misses. A maiden.  85th over: Bangladesh 279-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 65, Naeem Islam 36) Broad, bored of niceties like line and length, has decided to bomb Naeem Islam. Ian Bell comes in at short leg as a consequence, but Broad&apos;s length isn&apos;t quite right and Naeem is able to duck fairly comfortably. Then, when Broad pitches one up, Naeem times a lovely cover-drive for four and then drives four more through mid-on. England have a not insignificant problem here. &quot;Several Gary Naylors is an anagram of Arranger Says Lovely,&quot; says Chris Seymour. &quot;This is clear proof that &apos;Gary Naylor&apos; is a product of the OBOers, purely designed to fill space. I&apos;m on to you.&quot;  86th over: Bangladesh 282-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 66, Naeem Islam 38) Time for drinks.  87th over: Bangladesh 286-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 70, Naeem Islam 38) Broad spears in a wonderful yorker and the ball flies off the edge, into the ground and then over second slip for four. England thought it hit the boot first and went up for a huge LBW shout but it was definitely just bat. Lovely delivery, though. &quot;Robbikins,&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;Bell&apos;s song would be Chumbawamba&apos;s Tubthumping. The plucky little fellow has been knocked down a lot and we&apos;ve all been guilty. PS I&apos;ve just finished reading all the previous OBO and am now down to the sloth of live updates. Oh well. PPS Watched ITV4&apos;s IPL yesterday: that studio team was full of embarrassing silences and it&apos;ll take a long while to gel.&quot; Who was in the studio? I can&apos;t be bothered watching that meaningless garbage.  88th over: Bangladesh 286-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 70, Naeem Islam 38) A maiden from Bresnan to Naeem Islam. Phil Brown may not drink pints of hindsight, but those who do will have plenty to say about England&apos;s decision to go with four bowlers. They are starting to look a little weary, even though they are still hitting the pitch very hard, and there is no sense at all that a wicket is imminent.  89th over: Bangladesh 287-7 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 70, Naeem Islam 38) Swann replaces Broad and gets a go with the harder new ball. There is better bounce but the batsmen are very, very comfortable just now. England have a problem here, and a draw is no longer unthinkable on a pitch that is not deteriorating at all. &quot;It seems I have provoked an existential debate about the nature of Gary Naylor,&quot; lies Phil Sawyer. &quot;My work here is done. I&apos;m off to bed. By the time I wake up I hope it will have been established that, rather like Schr\u00f6dinger&apos;s cat, only the act of observing Gary Naylor can determine the state of Gary Naylor. And on that quantum note I bid you good night/morning/aardvark/other improbable quantum outcome.&quot;  WICKET! Bangladesh 296-8 (Naeem Islam run out) Oh, Bangladesh. After a brilliant partnership, Naeem Islam runs himself out by turning blind for a dodgy second. He would have got away with it but for a brilliant slide, pick up and throw from Michael Carberry at deep backward point, but Mushfiqur sent him back and Matt Prior did the rest. That is such a shame.  90th over: Bangladesh 296-8 (need 400 to avoid the follow-on; Mushfiqur Rahim 79, Abdur Razzak 0) Mushfiqur had struck Bresnan for two boundaries earlier in the over.  WICKET! Bangladesh 296-9 (Mushfiqur Rahim c sub (Tredwell) b Swann 79) Two wickets in two balls. Mushfiqur Rahim goes for the slog-sweep and the substitute Tredwell at short midwicket takes a really stunning one-handed catch diving almost backwards to his right.  WICKET! Bangladesh 296 all out (Rubel Hossain b Swann 0) That didn&apos;t take long. Swann gets his fifth Test five-for by bowling Rubel Hossain second ball, playing hopelessly inside the line. Swann ends with five for 90. So after that wonderful partnership, Bangladesh lost their last three wickets in four balls. Alastair Cook and Michael Carberry sprint straight off the field, and that means England have decided not to enforce the follow on. You can&apos;t really argue with that given the fact that they only have a four-man attack. Their lead is 303.  INNINGS BREAK  1st over: England 2-0 (led by 303 on first innings; Cook 1, Carberry 1) Cook gets off the mark first ball, touching Shahadat Hossain to leg for a single. This is an important little innings from Michael Carberry, who was scruffy against the spinners in the first innings. He gets off the mark with a flick to fine leg.  2nd over: England 4-0 (led by 303 on first innings; Cook 2, Carberry 2) Rubel Hossain (Test average: 73.80) starts from the Pavilion End. England are in no hurry. Watching England bat for a declaration in the third innings is one of life&apos;s very special tortures. They are traditionally hopeless at it. &quot;I wonder whether the reason they&apos;ve not enforced the follow on is to give Carberry another chance, the bowlers a rest on a pitch that&apos;s not looking at getting any worse, whilst also not allowing the Bangledashis to bowl on the fifth-day pitch when their spinners might get some aid from the pitch.&quot; I think it was mainly, in fact almost exclusively, because of the need to rest a four-man attack.  3rd over: England 6-0 (led by 303 on first innings; Cook 4, Carberry 2) A quiet over, in terms of run-scoring at least, from the grunting Shahadat to Cook, the most interesting thing which was the camera leering at sometime OBOer Kat Petersen, hiding under a floppy hat in Chittagong. It is, indeed, all right for some. &quot;These are obviously the more intelligent cricket fans&quot; says Bob Willis.  4th over: England 11-0 (led by 303 on first innings; Cook 6, Carberry 5) One over to tea. England are roaring towards a declaration.  5th over: England 12-0 (led by 303 on first innings; Cook 6, Carberry 6) Mahmudullah, the off-spinner, bowls the last over before tea. Carberry eschews the sweep, which got him out to the same bowler in the first innings, and instead turns a single to leg. And that&apos;s tea. Thanks for all your emails; Barney Ronay will talk you through the evening session.  TEA  Hello and thanks to the peerless Smyth who has now been levered out of his chair by support staff and helicoptered off to have his head unfrozen, spend six months in a Swiss spa, become the subject of a moving Elton John tribute record and receive a posthumous knighthood. Heroic stuff. I will be taking you through to the end of play. You can email me on or tweet me if you want, because I do all that these days. Some resistance from Bangladesh today. Some slightly disappointing captaincy too. Why have England only selected four bowlers? It is a mystery. Plus, some uninspired field placings from Cook who seems to have as much instinct for attack as he does when he&apos;s batting. But we shall see.  Lovely fielding from Carberry in that session. He&apos;s a real mover. Also, I always enjoy a random blinding catch from someone you&apos;re surprised to hear is actually on the field. I remember Martin Saggers taking one in Bangladesh last time around. James Kirtley got one at Lord&apos;s once. Any others?  Geoff Roberts notes: &quot;Since you have the thankless task of trying to make this stuff interesting, why don&apos;t you start by asking when England last lost a game that they had in the bag with a 300 odd lead after the first innings? It can happen you know.&quot; I&apos;m not sure what the answer is. Anyone? But I do know it&apos;s not going to happen here. The dead-pitch draw is the fear. But let&apos;s not forget England are on trial here: they&apos;ve come with a weakened team and they have to win. NB Note to Geoff Roberts: chin up. Might even see a bit of dash from England this session.  England are back out. Huge session for Carberry this. He&apos;s waited a long time for his chance. He will be nervous. Let&apos;s get inside his head for a bit. [Grrr.... No sweeping... Gah... Hmmm... Nerves... Fret, fret...]. Yes. Seems a bit nervous to me.  6th over: England 12-0 (led by 303 on first innings; Cook 6, Carberry 6) Carberry starts the session with a languid, teasing leave that looked a bit like a play and miss. He&apos;s right in behind the next couple of balls. 86mph from the slingy Rubel, but no real movement. Very defensive field from Shakib.  7th over: England 13-0 (led by 303 on first innings; Cook 7, Carberry 6) Shahadat comes back on to bowl to Cook and his first ball is a horrible overpitched thing outside off stump that Cook waves his bat at in ugly fashion. Shahadat makes a frightening &quot;AAAOORAAAGGHH!!&quot; noise as he bowls another 78mph dobbler. I remember he used to have a reputation for &quot;sconning&quot; batsmen - think he hit Ponting on the head once or twice. Incredible really looking at him now.  8th over: England 24-0 (led by 303 on first innings; Cook 16, Carberry 6) right. Time to get on with it and Cook does just that cutting a no-ball from Rubel away for four, a fierce almost front-footed slash. Cook will feel the need to do a bit of that given that it was his decision not to enforce the follow-on and here he goes again! Unfurling that full-bodied pull shot for another boundary square of the wicket from a weedy short ball. Rubel follows up with another no ball and this is really poor fare from a dropping Bangladesh in the field who at times have a mid-1990s England air about them.  9th over: England 27-0 (led by 303 on first innings; Cook 17, Carberry 8) More yodeling medium pace from Shahadat who, if anything, is getting louder. Carberry is bedding himself in but he&apos;ll have to go at some point and there he does indeed go with a nicely timed hip-clip for two, which is followed by a loud shout from the bowler and slips as he&apos;s hit on the pad outside the line. A bit too much doubt there and Tony Hill shrugs it off.  I remember watching Carberry when he first came through at Surrey and he was a real dasher, very exciting at the top of the order. He&apos;s definitely got the shots.  10th over: England 34-0 (led by 303 on first innings; Cook 20, Carberry 12) Cook clips a full toss away for two that would have been one against most Test teams as the man ambles round from deep fine leg. Carberry goes for an aggressive back foot force and plays and misses, then under-edges a drive off a half-volley along the ground through slips for four. And Gary Naylor wants a change of format, perhaps to one with a few more podium dancers and reverse-switch dab scoops: &quot;This innings is too slow. Global communications are a wonderful thing and I feel we should attempt an experiment on its limits. If you switch to ITV4 and OBO the upcoming IPL match, but keep the headers etc here exactly the same, will England get those runs? Could do us all a favour.&quot;  No. It&apos;s Sunday morning. We&apos;re staying here where it&apos;s nice and sedate. And look! Naeem Islam is coming on for Shahadat! That&apos;s quite exciting.  11th over: England 44-0 (led by 303 on first innings; Cook 29, Carberry 13) Naeem&apos;s first ball is a filthy long hop that Cook pulls for four, although in truth it deserved six, or eight or maybe 12. Some very average off-spin going on out there and England pootle on.  Shahadat has changed ends and come around the wicket to Carberry. AAAAOOORGHH!! indeed.  12th over: England 52-0 (led by 303 on first innings; Cook 30, Carberry 20) The pitch is still doing nothing and appears to be made from indestructible synthetic mattress. Shahadat wangs in a wide full toss and Carberry duly square drives for four nicely before cover-driving for an easy two. And John Starbuck has been wondering about podium dancers. &quot;As this is The Guardian I expect a troupe of podium dancers would have to be mixed, at the very least. OBO writers and readers, maybe? Who would you absolutely leave out and who might come through with a wholly unexpected thrilling display?&quot; Interesting point and a frankly quite disturbing mental image. There is no right answer to that.  13th over: England 53-0 (led by 303 on first innings; Cook 31, Carberry 20) Naeem continues and Cook is dropped playing a creaky sweep. Actually that&apos;s not even a drop as he just didn&apos;t get there in time, wandeirng in, diving very late and grasping at nothing. That was woeful. Cook now has 4,000 runs in Test cricket and he&apos;s the youngest, after Sachin Tendulkar, to get there.  14th over: England 60-0 (led by 303 on first innings; Cook 34, Carberry 20) Shahadat carries on with his strangley slow and unthreatening medium pace. One horrible leg side piece of filth goes for four byes against Rahim but that is mainly the bowler&apos;s fault. It&apos;s weird. Shahadat is tall and powerful and he rushes in and goes &quot;AAAAOORGGH!!&quot; but what emerges at the end is a Monty Panesar quicker ball. There must be some kind of technical whatnot going on. He needs to talk to Ian Pont. On Sky Bob Willis has just claimed to have bowled in the &quot;early 90s&quot; in his pomp. Interesting. Wonder how quick Botham was in 1979.  15th over: England 63-0 (led by 303 on first innings; Cook 37, Carberry 20) More yawnsome off-breaks from Naeem with England leading by 366. I feel a bit tired just thinking about this England bowling attack trying to get 10 wickets on this pitch. Thank heaven for Graeme Swann.  WICKET! Cook c Aftab b Mahmudullah 39 (England 65-1) Cook goes attempting a slog sweep that he top-edges up in the air and it&apos;s well caught on the boundary. The end of a frisky but too-brief innings off 55 balls.  16th over: England 65-1 (led by 303 on first innings; Trott 0, Carberry 20) Nice over from Mahmudullah and a chance for Trott to show some form. Or on the other hand for two under-pressure batsmen to pootle along not doing much when England need urgency. Let&apos;s have a look.  17th over: England 71-1 (led by 303 on first innings; Trott 6, Carberry 20) Shakib brings himself on for some left-arm slow stuff. Trott has looked iffy against spin early on but here he nudges an easy leg-side two to get off the mark. Shakib has three men close to the bat and this will be a test. On Willis and pace Gary Naylor writes: &quot;Bob Willis would probably have touched 90mph in his pomp (Bresnan hits 89mph FFS!). Botham was about 85mph, but had a useful bouncer that fooled many into believing he could bowl fast. Malcolm Marshall was about that pace too in the second half of his career, but retained his very very quick bouncer from his youth. Of course, he could make the ball talk like it was Kenneth Williams.&quot; Marshall could be quick. He had a menacing air. That gliding run up.  18th over: England 76-1 (led by 303 on first innings; Trott 10, Carberry 21) Mahmudullah to Carberry and he bowls a zinger, drawing him forward and getting some real actual turn to beat the defensive push. And oh Christ here we go with Trott scratching about like a cat that&apos;s just vacated its bowels. Perhaps peeved at waiting, the bowler fires in a leg-side pie and Trott glances nicely for four.  Drinks out in the middle. Very leisurely all round.  19th over: England 78-1 (led by 303 on first innings; Trott 10, Carberry 23) Shakib carries on bowling at the stumps to Carberry who defends mainly off the back foot. I&apos;m enjoying Rahim behind the stumps. He keeps saying &quot;lovely mate!&quot; and &quot;Well bowled fella!&quot; in a weird cockney-Aussie accent. England are 381 ahead and you wonder what their target is. 450 perhaps?  20th over: England 79-1 (led by 303 on first innings; Trott 11, Carberry 23) Slow-burning out there still with both these players looking to nudge and build and innings rather than score quickly. I suppose these two are in competition for a reserve opener&apos;s spot when Strauss comes back. Trott has slipped down the pecking order quite rapidly. And here&apos;s a thing: I have a feeling both Cook and Collingwood have passed 4,000 runs in this Test, both with the average 44.44. Must surely be a first (if I haven&apos;t hallucinated it).  21st over: England 80-1 (led by 303 on first innings; Trott 12, Carberry 23) Carberry attempts to inject some urgency with a sweep off middle and leg but the ball hits Kayes at short-leg - ow! - right in the chest and there&apos;s just one off the over from Shakib. Some very nice heartfelt condolences from Carberry as he gets up, but nothing much is happening out there right now.  22nd over: England 82-1 (led by 303 on first innings; Trott 14, Carberry 23) Mahmudullah carries on and he is bowling quite nicely. Trott prods and nudges two from the over. Carberry has 23 off 60 balls with England looking to post a declaration. On which Andy Bradshaw writes: &quot;Cork on TMS is going for lunch tomorrow. I&apos;m going for 500 ahead.&quot; I agree with Cork&apos;s 500. My 450 was provocatively couched to illuminate England&apos;s lack of urgency. Oh yes. You get it all here. It&apos;s like Talksport.  23rd over: England 83-1 (led by 303 on first innings; Trott 14, Carberry 24) To be fair to Bangladesh the last hour has been more urgent in the field. They seem to have drawn some encouragement from England&apos;s meandering. Which they carry on with in this over. On the 44.44 conundrum Lyn Bashforth writes: &quot;Hallucinating, Barney... Maybe it&apos;s the sound of Shahadat and a weird form of hypnosis. According to Cricinfo, Colly is on 3909 Test runs at an average of 43.43, so not yet...&quot; Yes but that&apos;s not including this Test is it Lyn? I think I might (against all odds, expectation and past form) be right.  24th over: England 87-1 (led by 303 on first innings; Trott 14, Carberry 28) I&apos;m sorry but this is just not good enough and England should be getting stuck in to Bangladesh here rather than having a net in the middle. Carberry finally gets an irresistible short ball and hammers it square for four. Then he&apos;s back to defending from the crease. Maybe harsh on a man in his first Test but he&apos;s an experience player. He knows what&apos;s needed here and you get more brownie points for reacting to the game.  WICKET! Trott c Siddique b Shakib 14 (England 87-2) That is either unlucky or poor execution depending on how you look at it. Trott pulls a long hop straight to midwicket at waist height and he&apos;s off for 14 from 24 balls. KP&apos;s in to face the left-arm spinner.  25th over: England 97-2 (led by 303 on first innings; Pietersen 10, Carberry 28) Lovely way to get off the mark for Pietersen, dancing down the track like a drunk man at a wedding, veering off to one side as the ball is speared in to his legs but flicking it through midwicket for four. Then he plays a lovely inside-out drive for four through cover, followed by a back-foot drive for two. Just what England want and they&apos;re 400 ahead now.  26th over: England 100-2 (led by 303 on first innings; Pietersen 10, Carberry 31) Carberry shows a bit more urgency, perhaps inspired by his new partner, but cuts hard twice to the fielder. Lyn Bashforth is holding her hands up on the 44.44 issue: &quot;Indeed, having checked Cook too, I see my error now. I blame the rotten cold bug that has filled my head with cotton wool in place of the usual little grey cells. Good for Colly too then. Gary Naylor wouldn&apos;t have made a schoolboy error like that, of course...&quot; Oi. Leave Naylor out of it. What&apos;s he done to you Bashforth? Er, you don&apos;t have to answer that.  27th over: England 101-2 (led by 303 on first innings; Pietersen 10, Carberry 32) Shakib still bowling his slow left arm not-much. Pietersen defends with almost sarcastic caution, then goes back to force on the off side and is hurried a bit. He does look aggressive though and this could be fun if he stays in.  28th over: England 109-2 (led by 303 on first innings; Pietersen 16, Carberry 34) A powerful sweep square for four by Pietersen off Mahmudullah&apos;s first ball. Carberry is also trying to force the pace but he keeps cutting and forcing straight to the fielder. Stay calm Carbs. And oh dear he&apos;s hit the short-leg Kayes again with a sweep and he&apos;s rolling around in agony. Blimey there&apos;s more from Gary Naylor: &quot;The only thing Bashers and I have ever done together is to sup beer and talk of cricket and other things on The Shelf, Third Floor, The Oval Pavilion - a great pleasure that I am looking forward to resuming come the cricket season.&quot; It works best if you say all that in a Leslie Phillips-style voice.  Abdul Razzak comes on. He got Pietersen in the first innings.  29th over: England 115-2 (led by 303 on first innings; Pietersen 22, Carberry 34) What he gets here is a smack for four first ball off a short legside delivery that the batsman swings powerfully through fine leg. Another short wide ball is cut for two and this is nice to see, Pietersen attacking for the team. He&apos;s got 22 off 18 balls now.  30th over: WICKET! Pietersen lbw Shakib 34 (England 126-3) (led by 303 on first innings; Collingwood 0, Carberry 34) Some real bounce off Shakib&apos;s first ball and it goes through outside off for a bye. We haven&apos;t seen anything like that yet. Maybe the ball hit a crack, or a mosquito. Pietersen responds by hitting Shakib for six over long-on, a really easy flowing lofted drive. That was a lovely shot and he follows it with a four through midwicket off the front foot. He looks so good when he plays like that. But guess what, it&apos;s followed by missing a straight ball lunging forward and he&apos;s out for 34 off 24. Terrible shame as he was playing really well.  31st over: England 126-3 (led by 303 on first innings; Collingwood, Carberry 34) Carberry continues to play fretfully as the onus switches to him to move things on. A maiden over that has him hopping and moving about a lot in the crease trying to manufacture a shot.  32nd over: England 129-3 (led by 303 on first innings; Collingwood 1, Carberry 34) Shakib continues and he has 2-32 now. Tom V D Gucht wanders: &quot;England should promote Swann up the order with instructions to give it some twenty/20 welly, it could be his chance to do a Gillespie and record his first test ton.&quot; That might be a bit far away but I agree he should bat above Broad. I&apos;ve seen Swann open successfully in one day cricket and he can play the new ball, as we&apos;ve seen in Tests. I&apos;d give him a go in ODIs but that&apos;s another argument (and deep down I&apos;m sure he&apos;d get found out damn it).  WICKET! Carberry lbw Razzak 34 (England 130-4) And there goes Carberry: hit on the pad deep in the crease with the ball looking likely to go on and clip leg. He&apos;s got 34 again and he trudges off looking very sad.  33rd over: England 130-4 (led by 303 on first innings; Collingwood 1, Bell 0) Razzak has a deep wide midwicket for the Collingwood heave but it&apos;s Carberry who perishes. Gary Naylor points out: &quot;Eoin Morgan is about to take the field for the Banglaore Royal Challengers - we could do with his brand of go forward cricket here!&quot; He would murder Bangladesh but not so sure yet about him facing about the really quick stuff in Tests. Brett Lee troubled him last summer.  34th over: England 131-4 (led by 303 on first innings; Collingwood 3, Bell 0) Shakib carries on and Bell defends in textbook fashion, playing for stumps now. England have done enough and they are massively in charg, but it has been a menader and I still have my doubts about batting again. Two overs to go here.  WICKET! Collingwood c Mahmudullah b Razzak 3 (England 131-5) Another one goes! Collingwood skips down the pitch and shovels the ball to mid-off for en easy catch. There seemed to be no need for that and England are hardly covering themselves in glory. Three wickets have falllen in no time at all.  35th over: England 131-5 (led by 303 on first innings; Prior 0, Bell 0) Collingwood seemed to be confused about what to do with that ball and really didn&apos;t go through with the shot. Prior defends, Bangladesh have two slips and they&apos;re chattering all over the place. They look the more up-for-it of the two teams right now.  36th over: England 131-5 (led by 303 on first innings; Prior 0, Bell 0) Shakib very nearly gets a quicker ball through on to Bell&apos;s pads on the back foot. The bowler was already appealing for that. Bell prods out the rest of the over.  And that is stumps. England are 434 runs ahead but it hasn&apos;t been the greatest of days. They eventually bowled Bangladesh out but the decision to bat again will be questioned. Perhaps the bowlers were tired but why only pick four of them if that rules out being able to ask your opponent to follow on? You have to back your selection. Some late wickets took the gloss off even further, but England should still win this. The declaration will come tomorrow and no doubt the Bangles will end up facing a manic Monday. That&apos;s all for me. Thanks for your emails.

Influential sections of Thai society, generally identified as the wealthy urban elite, the military and royalists, have been trying to get rid of Thaksin Shinawatra ever since he first became prime minister in 2001. Even though he now lives in exile, his banished shade haunts the streets of Bangkok. An unsuccessful plot to blow up Thaksin&apos;s plane two months after his first election victory launched a decade of turmoil. He was re-elected by another landslide in 2005, only to face more judicial challenges, apparent assassination plots, and finally the military coup that ousted him in 2006. The demonstrations that reached a new climax in the capital today have one central focus: a call for fresh elections, which pro-Thaksin parties would almost certainly win. Despite a recent court ruling that found him guilty of corruption and seized nearly \u00a31bn of his assets, Thaksin remains the power to be reckoned with in Thai politics. &quot;Brothers and sisters, don&apos;t give up. Don&apos;t fight for me. Fight for the country,&quot; he told his supporters at the weekend, speaking from an undisclosed overseas location. &quot;I am a symbol of those bullied by the elite who do not care about democracy and justice.&quot; Such statements smack of hyperbole. But Thailand&apos;s current prime minister, the Eton and Oxford-educated Abhisit Vejjajiva, is vulnerable to charges that he is a frontman for the vested interests of the Thai establishment. Abhisit did not gain office by popular vote but was installed at the end of 2008 after counter-demonstrations forced a pro-Thaksin coalition from office. Not long after, he was forced to declare a state of emergency to maintain his grip on power. Now he is adamantly resisting calls for new polls, thereby risking an escalation of the so far peaceful confrontation on the streets. As always in Thailand, where the military has taken over 18 times since the country became a constitutional monarchy in 1932, the army is never far away. Watching this latest drama play out is a 50,000-strong security force including soldiers and riot police deployed across Bangkok and surrounding provinces, the Bangkok Post reported. The government has also invoked the Internal Security Act that allows the military to ban gatherings and impose curfews. Given the impasse over new elections, and the decision by protesters belonging to the opposition United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship to symbolically shed their blood on the steps of Government House, it may not be long before involuntary bloodshed begins again in earnest, as happened last April. A grenade attack on a military base has ratcheted up tensions. The prime minister, meanwhile, remains holed up at the 11th infantry regiment&apos;s barracks in Bangkok&apos;s Bangkhen district, which the defence minister and army chiefs are using as an emergency headquarters. Abhisit says he wants the situation resolved without violence. But police chief Amnuay Nimmano warned the demonstrators to watch what they say, implying they risk arrest for alleged incitement to unrest and libellous statements. Thaksin&apos;s stance as champion of the people&apos;s freedoms must be taken with a large pinch of salt. His first term in office is remembered for a controversial drugs crackdown in which more than 2,000 people died; some, it was alleged, at the hands of government-licensed death squads. His failed attempt to end the low-level insurgency in Thailand&apos;s Muslim south was also widely criticised for brutality. His family&apos;s business dealings were always controversial and lie at the root of the corruption charges brought against him. All the same, being ruled by democratically-elected governments seems to be important to the people of Thailand, north and south, rural and urban, as it is to other nations. The fact remains, unpalatable to those who revile Thaksin&apos;s populist politics, that he and his allies win elections whenever they are fairly and freely staged. This is also an important consideration for Thailand&apos;s regional and western allies. Next door, Burma provides a salutary warning of what the subversion of the democratic process and unfettered military rule can entail. Thailand&apos;s political stability is important, too, for the region as a whole, for curbing the international drugs trade, keeping Islamist fundamentalism at bay, and for sustaining the economic rebound that has begun to take hold in south-east Asia. Thailand&apos;s recent history amounts to persuasive proof of the un-wisdom of military interventions in democratic life. Any respite from current troubles is only temporary. The coup-meisters only make matters worse.", "publicationDate": "2010-03-15T13:35:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Protest", "Thaksin Shinawatra", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/15/tthailand-protest-thaksin-bangkok", "title": "Keep the army out of Bangkok | Simon Tisdall", "sentences": ["Even though he now lives in exile, his banished shade haunts the streets of Bangkok.", "Watching this latest drama play out is a 50,000-strong security force including soldiers and riot police deployed across Bangkok and surrounding provinces, the Bangkok Post reported.", "The prime minister, meanwhile, remains holed up at the 11th infantry regiment&apos;s barracks in Bangkok&apos;s Bangkhen district, which the defence minister and army chiefs are using as an emergency headquarters."]}, {"article": "     The Thai prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, has refused to bow to demands for his resignation as &quot;red shirt&quot; protests against his government intensified today, with two soldiers injured in a grenade attack on an army barracks. Protest leaders promised rolling demonstrations that would cripple Bangkok amid reports of plans for each protester \u2013 more than 100,000 turned out yesterday \u2013 to donate 10ml of blood to be ceremoniously poured outside Bangkok&apos;s Government House morning. On the fourth consecutive day of mass rallies in the Thai capital, four grenades were launched towards troops at Bangkok&apos;s main army barracks, injuring one soldier in the stomach and another in the arm. No one was arrested. The major protest was at a separate army barracks of the 11th infantry regiment in the city&apos;s north, where the prime minister and key government figures were being held in safe houses and from where the government&apos;s security operation was being run by a self-described war cabinet. Appearing on national television from the barracks this morning, Abhisit rejected a demand to announce by midday that he would dissolve parliament and hold fresh elections. &quot;The coalition parties agree the demand cannot be met,&quot; he said. &quot;Elections must be held under common rules and genuine calm. We have to listen to other people&apos;s voices, not just the protesters&apos;.&quot; Red-shirt leader Natthawut Saikua said he would spill one thousand litres of blood donated by protesters around Government House, forcing Cabinet ministers to walk over it as they entered the building to work. Another 1,000 litres are to be spilled at Democrat Party headquarters, and another at Abhisit&apos;s house. As they noisily made their way through the streets \u2013 past shops and offices that have now been closed for four days and may stay shut the rest of the week \u2013 protesters were cheered on by residents who waved red scarves and offered water and fruit. Walking, piled on to motorbikes, riding in the back of utility trucks and jammed into buses, the column of more than 50,000 protesters stretched more than six miles and took several hours to arrive at the barracks. They found the prime minister gone and the barracks heavily fortified. The perimeter of the compound was ringed with razor wire and armed troops in combat gear stood one every five metres behind a broad moat. The heavy metal gates were reinforced, with army earth-moving equipment parked behind them. After several hours of incendiary speeches and patriotic songs blasted from loudspeakers, the protesters returned to their city base. Historically, most of the red-shirted protesters are supporters of the fugitive former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and hail from the north and north-east of Thailand, the base of Thaksin&apos;s still-potent electoral power. They claim the current administration is run by unelected Bangkok powerbrokers for the benefit of the capital&apos;s already wealthy elite, and is illegitimate because it came to office in a &quot;silent coup&quot; two years ago when a court ruling forced the dissolution of the ruling party. The traditional reds have been joined in this protest by a growing number of Bangkok residents, members of the city&apos;s growing middle class who, while not Thaksin supporters, see the current administration as undemocratic, elitist and self-serving. &quot;If Abhisit dissolves the parliament and calls an election we&apos;ll all go home,&quot; said a senior protest organiser, Weng Tojikram. &quot;We&apos;d like Abhisit to give the power back to the people.&quot; The Thaksin-aligned Puea Thai party would be expected to win any election called now. An election must be called before the end of next year under the Thai constitution. Police believe they can outlast the protesters, about 70% of whom work on farms. &quot;The protesters have food prepared for three or four more days,&quot; said spokesman, Prawut Thavornsiri. &quot;After that many people will need to go back to tend to their crops. Everything is under control.&quot; The British Foreign Office has again upgraded its travel warning on Thailand, describing the political situation as &quot;volatile&quot; and urging visitors to &quot;exercise extreme caution&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2010-03-15T15:58:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/15/thai-dissolution-refused-protests", "title": "Thai PM rejects demands to resign", "sentences": ["Protest leaders promised rolling demonstrations that would cripple Bangkok amid reports of plans for each protester \u2013 more than 100,000 turned out yesterday \u2013 to donate 10ml of blood to be ceremoniously poured outside Bangkok&apos;s Government House morning.", "On the fourth consecutive day of mass rallies in the Thai capital, four grenades were launched towards troops at Bangkok&apos;s main army barracks, injuring one soldier in the stomach and another in the arm.", "They claim the current administration is run by unelected Bangkok powerbrokers for the benefit of the capital&apos;s already wealthy elite, and is illegitimate because it came to office in a &quot;silent coup&quot; two years ago when a court ruling forced the dissolution of the ruling party.", "The traditional reds have been joined in this protest by a growing number of Bangkok residents, members of the city&apos;s growing middle class who, while not Thaksin supporters, see the current administration as undemocratic, elitist and self-serving."]}, {"article": "Thailand&apos;s anti-establishment red-shirted protesters under the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship have ended up where they stood last April, when their previous anti-government street demonstrations degenerated into wanton riots at several Bangkok locations. Back then, the UDD rampaged in the streets soon after the pro-establishment coalition government of Abhisit Vejjajiva took office with conspicuous army backing, after the reds&apos; elected governments and ruling party were snookered in the streets and Bangkok&apos;s airports by the yellow-shirted protesters under the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy and later dissolved by unprecedented judicial assertiveness. This time, the catalyst is the constitution court&apos;s landmark verdict on 26 February to seize nearly two thirds of exiled former-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra&apos;s frozen 76 billion baht, with the balance in legal limbo. The reds rallied and railed, then as now, for Thaksin on the one hand and against the establishment entitlements and privileges on the other. In Thailand&apos;s five-year saga of political drama and brinkmanship, the reds have seen their chosen party dissolved twice and their preferred leader deposed by a military coup. Their grievances and demands for a louder voice and a greater share have been dismissed time and again by the pro-establishment coalition comprising the military, palace insiders, the PAD, the Democrat Party, Bangkok&apos;s civil society and media with vested interests in the status quo \u2013 fronted by the suave and savvy Abhisit of Oxbridge pedigree and accent to pacify sceptics abroad and appear international at home. As Thailand&apos;s polarisation deepens and Thaksin&apos;s corruption is laid bare, the reds&apos; rage against social injustice and customised standards of the Bangkok-based elite who have lorded it over Thailand&apos;s steep socio-political hierarchy for decades have eclipsed Thaksin&apos;s own personal vendetta against his establishment enemies. For Thaksin, the struggle is now all personal after his assets confiscation. For the reds, the fight is increasingly an organic people&apos;s movement to upend the established order. Such all-or-nothing stakes bode ill for Thailand&apos;s stable future. During his five years of pandering populism, Thaksin unwittingly awoke the rural masses to a sense of opportunities and upward mobility previously unseen, and in so doing delivered Thailand into the 21st century. That he won&apos;t go away enables his establishment opponents to paint the reds as gullible and misguided Thaksin-lackeys and hinders the reds from finding alternative leadership and organisational wherewithal. The post-coup period since Thaksin was ousted in September 2006 has been a grand campaign to put a lid on the red forces unleashed during his rule. That lid is tested during each reds&apos; upsurge. At issue now is whether they will regroup and return to Bangkok&apos;s streets yet again. Their best option, and Thailand&apos;s most workable road ahead, is to put up and encourage as much a democratic process as possible before new polls are due late next year. If by then Abhisit still cannot come up with the goods and connect with the neglected rural heartlands even as constitutional rules and electoral referees are stacked against his opponents, the reds can have their say. Abhisit is the logical offspring of the establishment but until his backers make the necessary adjustments, reforms and concessions to accommodate the new demands and expectations of the 21st century, the reds simply will return in one fashion or another.", "publicationDate": "2010-03-16T11:00:01Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Protest", "World news", "Thaksin Shinawatra", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/16/thailand-red-shirt-protests", "title": "Lifting the lid on Thailand's red-shirts | Thitinan Pongsudhirak", "sentences": ["Thailand&apos;s anti-establishment red-shirted protesters under the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship have ended up where they stood last April, when their previous anti-government street demonstrations degenerated into wanton riots at several Bangkok locations.", "Back then, the UDD rampaged in the streets soon after the pro-establishment coalition government of Abhisit Vejjajiva took office with conspicuous army backing, after the reds&apos; elected governments and ruling party were snookered in the streets and Bangkok&apos;s airports by the yellow-shirted protesters under the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy and later dissolved by unprecedented judicial assertiveness.", "Their grievances and demands for a louder voice and a greater share have been dismissed time and again by the pro-establishment coalition comprising the military, palace insiders, the PAD, the Democrat Party, Bangkok&apos;s civil society and media with vested interests in the status quo \u2013 fronted by the suave and savvy Abhisit of Oxbridge pedigree and accent to pacify sceptics abroad and appear international at home.", "As Thailand&apos;s polarisation deepens and Thaksin&apos;s corruption is laid bare, the reds&apos; rage against social injustice and customised standards of the Bangkok-based elite who have lorded it over Thailand&apos;s steep socio-political hierarchy for decades have eclipsed Thaksin&apos;s own personal vendetta against his establishment enemies.", "At issue now is whether they will regroup and return to Bangkok&apos;s streets yet again."]}, {"article": "     It certainly looks spectacular, but what does it mean? According to the Bangkok Post, today&apos;s blood protest by Thai &quot;Red Shirts&quot; loyal to their country&apos;s multi- millionaire deposed prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, saw &quot;12 five-litre bottles, two large buckets and 50 syringes of blood&quot; ceremonially splashed on the four gates of Government House and over the headquarters of the ruling Democrat party in a &quot;ritual aimed at bringing down the government&quot;. The blood had been collected from several thousand supporters by the opposition United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship. Red Cross officials objected, arguing that throwing 300 litres of human blood on assorted public buildings might not be the best possible use of such a valuable resource, and that in a country with a relatively high rate of HIV infection, its collection and disposal raised potential public health issues. Again according to the Bangkok Post, three demonstrators, including a Hindu brahman and a man carrying a statue of Buddha, &quot;walked to the first gate of Government House, where a religious rite was performed. The brahman cited spells and incantations, and poured an amount of blood in front of the gate.&quot; Next, &quot;the brahman took some of the blood from the ground to write letters on the concrete posts of the gate.&quot; Other Red tactics aimed at removing the present premier, Abhisit Vejjajiva, who they claim came to power illegitimately following the coup that ousted Thaksin for alleged corruption and abuse of power in 2006, have included burning coffins, breaking a pot in front of the statue of King Taksin, and throwing plastic bags full of rotten fish. Blood, a symbol of life (and death), features in religious and other rituals around the world. Australian Aboriginals exchanged blood and rubbed it over their bodies in secret ceremonies; the spilling of human sacrificial blood was an important part of Aztec and other Mesoamerican cultures; ancient Germanic tribes sprinkled blood on walls and on the statues of their gods (the process of smearing blood was known in Old English as bleodsian, a term apparently at the root of the Catholic term blessing). Catholics, obviously, believe consecrated wine becomes the blood of Jesus. There appear, however, to be relatively few examples of blood being poured as a form of modern political protest. That&apos;s what it plainly is, though, for those leading Thailand&apos;s pro-Thaksin demonstrations \u2013 even if they&apos;re not entirely certain why. Nattawut Saikur, one Red leader, said the blood showed the movement&apos;s &quot;commitment in calling for democracy&quot;, and was an &quot;important curse ritual&quot;. If Abhisit refuses to step down, Saikur added, &quot;even though he does not have blood on his hands, his feet will be bloodied with our curses&quot;.Another Red leader, Veera Musikapong, said the gesture was &quot;a sacrificial offering . . . to show our love for the nation, to show our sincerity&quot;. A third, Somsak Janprasert, told AFP: &quot;This is a very symbolic way to express that our blood, the people&apos;s blood, is power.&quot; Experts on Thai culture and beliefs appear no less nonplussed: as SP Somtow, a Thai author and composer, relates on his entertaining and informative blog (somtow.org) that a recent televised debate between an authoritative panel of &quot;Thailand&apos;s leading astrologers and magicians&quot; failed completely to arrive at any meaningful conclusion as to the efficacy \u2013 or, indeed, the meaning \u2013 of the blood-spattering ceremonies, beyond observing that many Red supporters come from &quot;the superstitious north&quot;. Possible theories, Somtow says, include the Cambodian &quot;which states that pouring blood on the headquarters of the government is a Cambodian plot to ensure the return of Thaksin&quot;; the Astrologers, propounded by the chairperson of the Thai astrology society, which holds that blood-spilling is &quot;simple sympathetic magic in order to gain victory, and the sort of thing anyone would do under the circumstances&quot;; and the Historical, which seems based on the legend that the 16th-century Thai king Naresuan once ordered his army to capture and behead the Khmer king Satha so he could &quot;use his victim&apos;s blood to wash his feet in&quot;. So will the gory ritual work? Nothing, says Somtow, is less certain. According to the TV experts, &quot;using your enemies&apos; blood to ensure victory might be a logical example of sympathetic magic, but spilling your own could have the opposite effect.&quot; The Cambodian theory, too, could well backfire, &quot;because you need to be &apos;pure of heart&apos; to perform that rite . . . Without such doctrinal protection the magic would reverse itself, and the intended consequences would occur to the curser, not the cursee.&quot; And in any case, everyone agreed that &quot;the entire ceremony can easily be negated by sprinkling some holy water from the Emerald Buddha Temple over the blood&quot;. Magic spells, voodoo rituals, blood-spilling and fish-throwing, Somtow concludes, are unlikely to solve Thailand&apos;s immediate problems. But hey, if what you&apos;re after is the dissolution of the lower house of parliament, &quot;when you have the all the resources of witchcraft and the supernatural at your disposal, why stoop to such mundane devices as, for instance, lobbying one of the smaller parties to switch sides so as to shift the balance of power?&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-03-16T19:00:01Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/16/thailand-human-blood-protest", "title": "Thailand's blood protest: what does it actually mean?", "sentences": ["According to the Bangkok Post, today&apos;s blood protest by Thai &quot;Red Shirts&quot; loyal to their country&apos;s multi- millionaire deposed prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, saw &quot;12 five-litre bottles, two large buckets and 50 syringes of blood&quot; ceremonially splashed on the four gates of Government House and over the headquarters of the ruling Democrat party in a &quot;ritual aimed at bringing down the government&quot;.", "Again according to the Bangkok Post, three demonstrators, including a Hindu brahman and a man carrying a statue of Buddha, &quot;walked to the first gate of Government House, where a religious rite was performed."]}, {"article": "In case you haven&apos;t spotted it so far, here&apos;s the shortlist for this year&apos;s Hugo Award for best novel: Boneshaker by Cherie Priest; The City &amp; The City by China Mi\u00e9ville; Julian Comstock: A Story of 22nd-Century America by Robert Charles Wilson; Palimpsest by Catherynne M Valente; Wake by Robert J Sawyer; and The Windup Girl by Paolo Bacigalupi. Last year&apos;s shortlist saw a dust-up led by SF writer Adam Roberts, who didn&apos;t think the books were good enough. It remains to be seen how this one goes down, but from the viewpoint of the more casual SF reader like me, the list has done its job. It has brought some otherwise hidden books into the limelight.  A quick Google search shows that only The City &amp; The City has received plentiful mainstream review coverage, along with a few mentions of Canadian Robert J Sawyer&apos;s book in Canada. (Significantly, none have been mentioned in the New York Times.) As usual, this lack of coverage says more about the mainstream press than the books in question. Why Jonathan Safran Foer&apos;s decision to eat no meat or Ian McEwan&apos;s discovery that global warming may not be to the universal benefit of mankind should merit so many more column inches than these intriguing books is a question I can&apos;t answer \u2026 What I can say is that \u2013 at first glance, at least \u2013 all the books seem interesting enough to merit more attention. Boneshaker by Cherie Priest Boneshaker is not the only steampunk book on the list. Although I can&apos;t help wondering how long before the boiler blows on the overheated sub-genre, there&apos;s no denying it provides some fine conceits. How&apos;s the following for a publisher&apos;s description? &quot;At the start of the Civil War, a Russian mining company commissions a great machine to pave the way from Seattle to Alaska and speed up the gold rush that is beating a path to the frozen north. Inventor Leviticus Blue creates the machine, but on its first test run it malfunctions, decimating Seattle&apos;s banking district and uncovering a vein of Blight Gas that turns everyone who breathes it into the living dead.&quot; Yes! It&apos;s &quot;pure mad adventure&quot; according to boing boing and that sounds good to me. The City &amp; The City by China Mi\u00e9ville If the quality of the one book that I&apos;ve read from the shortlist is anything to go by, this should be a vintage year. China Mi\u00e9ville has set a hard-boiled detective thriller in a city called Beszel that has the strange distinction of being in the same place as another city called Ul Qoma. If that sounds confusing, that&apos;s because it is, but wrapping your brain around the strangeness is all part of the pleasure and challenge of the book. Imagine The Wire with added weirdness and less over-acting. It pushes up against the boundaries of possibility to provoke reassessment of our own reality. It has a few rough edges \u2013 but only as a result of flinging itself so hard at the doors of perception. Julian Comstock: A Story of 22nd-Century America by Robert Charles Wilson Previous Hugo winner Robert Charles Wilson&apos;s 13th novel has the steampunk-inspired setting of a world after peak oil, where technology has retreated to pre-20th century levels and the United States is dominated by the Dominion Of Jesus Christ on Earth (think the Catholic church, only even worse). It features the deliberately florid narration of the titular hero&apos;s adventures in a war against the Dutch (of all people). It&apos;s a 22nd-century novel, written in 19th-century style that has direct bearing on the present day, and Cory Doctorow says it&apos;s: &quot;politically astute, romantic, philosophical, compassionate and often uproariously funny.&quot;  Palimpsest by Catherynne M Valente Palimpsest is &quot;a sexually transmitted city&quot;. Bits of its map are transferred from lover to lover in the form of tattoos \u2013 and people are only able to enter those parts that appear on their body. Those that want to get around Palimpsest properly have to find &quot;sequential lovers&quot; who link up to their map. It&apos;s a setting that might out-weird even China Mi\u00e9ville and it&apos;s undeniably ingenious \u2013 although first glimpses suggest an over-use of adjectives: &quot;They wear extraordinary uniforms: white and green scales laid one over the other, clinging obscenely to the skin, glittering in the spirelight.&quot; Yet, the online reviews I&apos;ve read suggest that this clotted-cream approach just adds to the richness in the long run.  Wake by Robert J Sawyer A blind teenage maths genius undergoes an operation to recover her sight \u2013 and when she wakes up discovers that she can also see the electronic signals of the World Wide Web. She does so just in time to help her perceive a new consciousness, the world&apos;s first digital intelligence \u2013 as it comes to life on the internet. This is supposedly a return to the hard science fiction of the old school, blending theories from pure science with imaginative speculation. The Canadian National Post says that Sawyer has put together: &quot;a daunting quantity of fact and theory from across scientific disciplines and applied them to a contemporary landscape... He paints a complete portrait of a blind teenage girl, and imagines in detail \u2013 from scratch \u2013 the inside of a new being.&quot; You can read a big chunk of it here.

In the country&apos;s worst political violence for two decades, troops fired rubber bullets and teargas at thousands of red-shirted supporters of the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra who gathered in Bangkok yesterday in defiance of emergency rule. The demonstrators, who are calling for the resignation of the prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, fought troops with guns and petrol bombs. Countries including South Korea have issued warnings about visiting Thailand, in a move that could damage its tourism industry. The Australian foreign minister warned of a &quot;strong possibility of further violence&quot; in protest areas. The street fighting, which included gunfire and molotov cocktails and left pools of blood on the streets, spread to the Khao San Road, a popular backpacker destination, and around Bangkok&apos;s Democracy Monument. The dead included four soldiers and 16 civilians, according to an emergency centre set up to deal with casualties. At least 834 people have been injured in Thailand&apos;s worst violence since 48 people were killed in an anti-military protest in 1992. One victim, Hiro Muramoto, a Japanese cameraman for the Thomson Reuters news agency, died after being shot in the chest. A Japanese tourist who was wearing a red shirt and was mistaken for one of the protesters was clubbed by troops until being rescued by bystanders. Protesters reportedly captured about 28 soldiers during the violence, but they were later released. The violence is part of a long-running uprising by the mostly poor and rural-dwelling supporters of Thaksin, who accuse the ruling elite of orchestrating a military coup against him in 2006 amid allegations of corruption. On Wednesday, Vejjajiva called a state of emergency after protesters briefly broke into the parliament building, forcing some government officials to flee by helicopter. Veera Musikapong, one of around 27 red shirt leaders, said: &quot;We are changing our demand from dissolving parliament in 15 days to dissolving parliament immediately. And we call for Abhisit to leave the country immediately.&quot; Jatuporn Prompan, another of the protest leaders, said Vejjajiva&apos;s hands were &quot;bloodied&quot;. &quot;There is no more negotiation. Red shirts will never negotiate with murderers,&quot; he said. &quot;Although the road is rough and full of obstacles, it&apos;s our duty to honour the dead by bringing democracy to this country.&quot; An army spokesman, Colonel Sansern Kaewkamnerd, accused protesters of firing live rounds and throwing grenades. One cameraman reported seeing two protesters carrying assault rifles, while others showed off a pile of weapons captured from troops, including machine gun rounds. The Thai government has said that no live rounds were fired at demonstrators. Vejjajiva, who appeared on television last night to offer condolences to the families of victims, said he would not bow to the protesters&apos; demands. &quot;The government and I are still responsible for easing the situation and trying to bring peace and order to the country,&quot; he said. An official truce between the red shirts and the government was called yesterday after troops pulled back, but the protesters said they would parade the bodies of dead comrades through the streets tomorrow, which could lead to further clashes. The most recent clashes are part of a series of violent confrontations between different anti-government protesters, associated with different coloured shirts and successive Thai governments. In 2008 more than 400 people were injured and others killed after the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (Pad) \u2013 known as the yellow shirts \u2013 brought down a pro-Thaksin government headed by the former prime minister Somchai Wongsawat, Thaksin&apos;s brother-in-law.", "publicationDate": "2010-04-11T10:24:37Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Protest", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/11/thailand-anti-government-protests", "title": "Thai protesters rule out talks after deadly clashes", "sentences": ["In the country&apos;s worst political violence for two decades, troops fired rubber bullets and teargas at thousands of red-shirted supporters of the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra who gathered in Bangkok yesterday in defiance of emergency rule.", "The street fighting, which included gunfire and molotov cocktails and left pools of blood on the streets, spread to the Khao San Road, a popular backpacker destination, and around Bangkok&apos;s Democracy Monument."]}, {"article": "The Thai prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, is under increasing pressure to resign after the country&apos;s electoral commission ordered his ruling Democrat party be dissolved for accepting illegal donations. The decision \u2013 which comes days after the worst political violence in a generation \u2013 is a blow to the beleaguered Abhisit, and further complicates Thailand&apos;s fragile political situation. On Saturday, 21 people were killed and more than 800 injured in pitched battles between anti-government protesters and troops. After just 16 months in office, the prime minister is facing calls to stand down. Military leaders, who had supported Abhisit, are now calling for fresh elections. The electoral commission&apos;s ruling relates to a donation of 258m Baht (\u00a35m) from cement manufacturer TPI Polene in 2005 when Abhisit was deputy leader of the Democrats. Donations are limited to 10m Baht (\u00a3200,000). The decision must be approved by the attorney general before going to the constitutional court for a final adjudication. Party spokesman Buranaj Smutharaks said the ruling would be challenged. &quot;We know about the EC&apos;s decision, but the case is not over yet.&quot; Diplomatic sources told the Guardian it is likely to be months before the court process is extinguished. &quot;But this is a significant development, coming right now, this just makes things worse for Abhisit, harder for him to hold on,&quot; said one foreign diplomat. The electoral commission&apos;s decision heaps further pressure on the government, which is still reeling from the weekend violence which erupted when troops were ordered to move on anti-government &quot;red-shirt&quot; protesters who had occupied key roads in Bangkok for a month. Protesters threw petrol bombs and grenades, and troops responded with warning shots before, in some cases, opening fire. The prime minister has blamed &quot;terrorists&quot; who had infiltrated the red-shirts for sparking the violence. Abhisit has refused to bow to their demands to dissolve parliament, but there are reports an early election is being considered. An unnamed Democrat source told the Bangkok Post an early election may be called for October. &quot;We will see how the situation progresses this week and then a decision may be made one way or the other. It&apos;s a fine balance. Early elections may calm things down but we don&apos;t want to show that we are giving into the demands of an armed gang,&quot; the official said. The military, an influential player in Thai politics, has called for fresh elections. Army chief General Anupong Paojinda suggested today that he was reluctant to use force to put down protests again after the weekend&apos;s bloodshed. &quot;The best solution to this is to dissolve the House,&quot; he said. &quot;We must return to politics to solve the problem. It must be ended by political means.&quot; But an October poll may not be enough to satisfy the red-shirts, who are demanding Abhisit resign immediately and leave the country. &quot;We will continue to protest until Mr Abhisit is no longer prime minister,&quot; red-shirt leader Jatuporn Prompan said. An uneasy peace held on the streets of Bangkok yesterday. The red-shirts marched through the capital&apos;s main roads carrying coffins to honour comrades killed in the weekend&apos;s violence. Shot with high-velocity bullets Anti-government protesters killed in street clashes on Saturday were shot with high-velocity bullets, according to police pathologists. Autopsies on 11 bodies found nine died from gunshot wounds to the head or chest. One man died from heart failure. The final body was that of Japanese cameraman Hiro Muramoto, who was shot in the chest. His cause of death was not disclosed. The Thai government denied soldiers fired live rounds. &quot;Weapons were only used in self-defence and to fire into the air,&quot; said government spokesman Panitan Wattanayagorn. &quot;We have found no evidence that soldiers used weapons against the people,&quot; said a spokesman.", "publicationDate": "2010-04-12T18:16:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/12/thailand-protests-democrat-party-ban", "title": "Thai watchdog orders dissolution of ruling party", "sentences": ["The electoral commission&apos;s decision heaps further pressure on the government, which is still reeling from the weekend violence which erupted when troops were ordered to move on anti-government &quot;red-shirt&quot; protesters who had occupied key roads in Bangkok for a month.", "An unnamed Democrat source told the Bangkok Post an early election may be called for October.", "An uneasy peace held on the streets of Bangkok yesterday."]}, {"article": "From Burmese pythons to pygmy marmosets, there is a roaring illegal trade in animals online. A recent convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species found one rare species \u2013 the Kaiser&apos;s spotted newt (an orange and black salamander in the highland streams of Iran) \u2013 now numbers fewer than 1,000 adults in the wild because of internet trading. So what can you find on the internet? In just one day, I discovered dealers who appear to be selling some of the rarest species on earth. Ploughshare tortoise Within a few hours, I was staring at an advert for one of the world&apos;s most endangered creatures. It read, &quot;Very superb, jumbo size and most of all very rare&quot;. Only 200 mature ploughshare tortoises survive in the bamboo scrublands of north Madagascar; the rest, it seems, are online. And what would this pair of 30-year-old tortoises cost? \u00a324,000, and a trip to Kuala Lumpur: there&apos;s no international shipping. Burmese starred tortoise It is against the law to remove the critically endangered Burmese starred tortoise from the forests of Myanmar, but I easily found an apparent seller in Bangkok, Thailand. The dealer&apos;s picture features 35 turtles in a laundry basket lined with newspaper and wilted lettuce. Ten years ago, a survey by the Wildlife Conservation Society found few specimens in the wild. They did, however, find a tortoise trader in every village.

International law requires that these African species come with permits from their country of origin \u2013 conservationists worry that few wild-caught Bosc&apos;s survive to maturity in captivity and supplies are replenished from wild populations. The ad doesn&apos;t mention permits. Elephant ivory     An African elephant in the Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda.

I called one dealer who seemed knowledgeable about the required permits; the same can&apos;t be said of many online sellers. Some nod to legality by claiming their ivory is antique; others don&apos;t bother. On Craigslist I found an &quot;Endangered Species Ivory Neclace&quot; [sic] in California ($120). The seller claims it&apos;s &quot;circa 1980&quot;, but without a permit, there&apos;s no way to tell.

Identity     Getting to know you \u2026\u00a0Photo: Cinetext/Allstar    Anna (Deborah Kerr) arrives in Bangkok, all prissy, crinolined Englishwoman abroad, complete with a nasty spoiled son in a Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit. &quot;Sometimes I wonder if you know what you&apos;re really facing, an Englishwoman alone in a country like Siam,&quot; growls the ship&apos;s captain. True, Leonowens claimed to have been born in Wales in 1834 into an upper-middle class family. But in fact, according to a recent biography, she was born in Bombay in 1831, to a poor, widowed teenage mother of mixed British and Indian origin. She grew up entirely in India, speaking Hindi and Marathi as well as English, and never even visited the British Isles until after she left Siam. From India, she made her way to Singapore, reinvented herself as an educated Welsh gentlewoman, and bagged the job at the Siamese court. The rest of her life was spent as if starring in one long episode of Faking It. Amazingly, no one rumbled her.  Religion     If you please\u00a0\u2026  Photo: Cinetext/Allstar    Anna thinks she should have her own house, but Mongkut (Yul Brynner) wants her to live within his palace. The dialogue of their argument is taken from Leonowens&apos; memoirs, but in real life Mongkut was not just being petulant and arbitrary, as he appears in the film. Her desire to leave near the expat community indicated to him that she might want, as he put it, &quot;to convert our Children to Christianity \u2026 like American Missionaries and their wives have done here before.&quot; For the 1860s, Leonowens was unusually enlightened about religious tolerance, writing in her memoirs: &quot;We are prone to ignore or to condemn that which we do not clearly understand; and thus it is, and on no better ground, that we deny that there are influences in the religions of the East to render their followers wiser, nobler, purer.&quot; The kiddies stayed Buddhist, and the king stayed happy.  Liberty     Thai fighters \u2026  Photo: Cinetext/Allstar    Anna assumes the role of mother hen over the ladies of the king&apos;s harem, filling their pretty little heads with supposedly western ideas about freedom, feminism, monogamy, and the amazing liberating power of Uncle Tom&apos;s Cabin. The patronising tone of this stuff comes from the 1940s novelisation of Anna&apos;s time in Thailand by Margaret Landon. The real Leonowens described the ladies of the harem as her &quot;sisters&quot;, and saw them intellectually and morally as her equals or betters. This film leaves out the controversial twist, alleged by Leonowens but doubted by historians, in which Mongkut&apos;s slave Tuptim (Rita Moreno) is burnt at the stake for taking a lover. To be fair, even the unfailingly cheery Rodgers and Hammerstein might have had a hard time writing a family-friendly musical number about that. Anyway, it probably never happened. Mongkut issued edicts to improve the lives of slaves, and his son, Chulalongkorn, abolished slavery.  Romance     A fine romance \u2026 Photo: Cinetext/Allstar    What passed for daring hints at interracial romance in 1956 won&apos;t raise too many eyebrows today \u2013 and not just because it&apos;s embarrassingly obvious that no one in the cast is actually Thai. During an energetic polka to Shall We Dance?, Mongkut puts his hand on Anna&apos;s waist, but that&apos;s the extent of it. Nevertheless, the suggestive implication is one reason why this version of The King and I has been banned in Thailand. In real life, there is no evidence for any romantic attachment between Leonowens and the king. As for her dalliance in the film with Sir Edward Ramsey, a supposed old flame from her ballroom dancing days back in south-west London, the fact that she was a working class Anglo-Indian who had never been to England writes that one off, too. Verdict     Shall we dance?

This year that violence was some of the worst in the country&apos;s history and it was tourists on Khao San Road, the backpacking hub of south-east Asia, who had front row seats. The crisis is clearly far from over, and yet there is little tourists can do other than try and get back to their holiday. Last Sunday afternoon, one journalist surveying the damage tweeted that 50 metres from where people were killed, tourists were watching the Blackburn v Manchester United match. It would be unfair to ask tourists to think too hard about Thailand&apos;s problems; they are, after all, on holiday. Yet, whether they realise it or not, tourists are not just spectators to the political turmoil. All sides in this conflict use tourism as a weapon to achieve their aims. The decision of the Yellow Shirts to close the airport in 2008 was an audacious move, designed for maximum impact. As of yet, the Reds have not targeted tourism so explicitly, but that might well be changing. The fact that the Reds have continued their protest, despite suffering the losses they did, shows how determined they are. Also, as they become more desperate, it makes sense that they will attempt to put pressure on the government through directly targeting the economy. This week the protest site moved from the area close to Khao San, to Ratchaprasong, the main shopping district and a stone&apos;s throw from the city&apos;s major hotels. With tourism accounting for approximately 6.5% of Thailand&apos;s economy, the finance minister is now saying that the protests could drop growth by two percentage points as occupancy rates at hotels in Bangkok fall to only 30%. Groups representing the tourism industry are urging the government and the protesters to &quot;join hands to solve the problem&quot;. While such facts and figures must strike fear into those working in the industry, they are also being used as one of the most legitimate ways to reprimand the protesters. Unlike other industries which can get back to normal after political unrest, tourism relies upon a country&apos;s reputation. In Thailand, tourism developed during the cold war, when the country was regarded as an oasis of peace on a troubled continent. The idea that Thai society lived in harmony was itself commodified as a reason to visit the country. Since then, foreigners have often been used in state media as a device from which to view this pleasant society. And in recent years campaigns to urge against violence have from time to time asked the question, what will the foreigners think? These messages work. Radio talk shows often have phone-ins about what foreigners think of the Thai people asserting the fact that Thais are good-natured and kind toward their guests. Also, normal Red Shirts are very conscious of embracing foreign guests. Last month, when a foreigner arrived to give blood to the Red Shirt campaign, what was most notable was the elation on the faces of those around. The woman taking the blood wanted to be sure a video was taken so that the Yellow Shirts would see that they too had the support of the foreign community. But the problem for the protesters, whether they are Red or Yellow, is that statements about how good-natured they are, or should be, must not get in the way of achieving their aims. Particularly with the largely rural Red Shirts, these protests are in many ways fighting to break the very stereotypes with which they are labelled. They are asserting that they are not subservient and happy with the status quo, but active members of the political system. Tourists who travel to Thailand for an &quot;authentic&quot; experience of local culture will continue to find it in guest houses and beach bars. But, while the best advice might be to stay in those bubbles, it is inevitable that they will increasingly be drawn into the reality of what is happening on the streets.", "publicationDate": "2010-04-17T15:00:02Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Thailand holidays", "World news", "Travel", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/17/thailand-tourism", "title": "Tranquillity and turmoil in Thailand | Matthew Phillips", "sentences": ["The Thai new year is one of the highlights of the tourist calendar and has for two years now been marred with violence in Bangkok.", "With tourism accounting for approximately 6.5% of Thailand&apos;s economy, the finance minister is now saying that the protests could drop growth by two percentage points as occupancy rates at hotels in Bangkok fall to only 30%."]}, {"article": "Lion&apos;s View, Cape Town Located above fashionable Camps Bay and designed by a leading South African architect, this pad is made up of a main house with five double bedrooms and a penthouse with two doubles, and can be rented separately or as a whole.

We&apos;re now looking at a 24-plus-hour bus ride to Germany, where we&apos;ll probably be stuck as well. There&apos;s not much media coverage of the situation in the country we&apos;re in; you don&apos;t have as many options as you would in France or Germany. We&apos;re making it up as we go along, trying to get to a country where things are a bit more accessible. I had to text my headteacher to tell her that I wouldn&apos;t be back for school and she told me to let her know when I had more information. Apparently, there&apos;s quite a few of us having trouble getting back. My friend is a headteacher in another school, so she&apos;s got a lot of responsibilities. But at the end of the day, we can&apos;t do anything about it. The most difficult thing is that we don&apos;t have much news information. If we were in a different country, then we could probably get news about what&apos;s going on. We just don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on and it&apos;s very difficult to get anywhere. We&apos;ve just been trying to get information. In the meantime, we&apos;re shopping around, doing tourist sights and trying to pass the time. We&apos;re just trying to get on that bus tomorrow.&quot; \u2022 Ruth Corney, photographer, 44, from north London, was on holiday with her husband, Mark Bloom, 46, and their kids, Joe, 14, and Lilah, 9, in Barcelona: &quot;We were supposed to be getting the plane back on Saturday. But on Thursday night, my husband came upstairs and told me the news. We weren&apos;t sure what to, but we&apos;re lucky because we&apos;re staying in the same hotel as all the BA staff. We&apos;re going to get the coach to Paris tonight, so we&apos;ve got a 10-hour journey ahead of us. We can&apos;t get any further through the coach company, but we&apos;ve managed to get on a Eurostar tomorrow night. It&apos;s been a real pain; the coach is costing \u00a3235 and the Eurostar will be \u00a3720. The there&apos;s the extra for the hotel we&apos;re staying in \u2013 about \u00a3300 \u2013 so we&apos;re just dreading the bill. We&apos;ve been trying to go easy on the money and buying our food at the market. We&apos;ve amused ourselves by making cushions from things we bought at the market. We want to get back because Lilah is singing at the Albert Hall on Wednesday \u2013 it&apos;s a big thing with all the primary schools in our area. She&apos;s been dying to do it and they&apos;ve been working on it for months.&quot; \u2022 Nikita and Chris Ferdinand, who are both doctors from London, have been stranded in Dubai since Friday and told they could be there for another fortnight. The couple and their 22-month-old son, Ashton, were on their way back from a holiday in India and a visit to relatives in Sri Lanka. They got the first leg of their Emirates flight home in the hope that when flights re-start they will be closer to getting to London but so far they have not been able to get beyond Dubai. Chris&apos;s parents remain stranded in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The Ferdinands&apos; airline is refusing to help pay for food or accommodation and the young family is spending \u00a3100 a night to share a holiday apartment with distant relatives also stranded in Dubai, whom they found on Facebook. They are calling the airline every four hours as instructed and have been told the earliest they can fly home is 4 May \u2013 meaning they could face a bill of some \u00a32,000 just for board while they wait to get back. Their travel insurance company has indicated it may cover around \u00a3600 of that. &quot;There is a real shortage of places to stay. The hotel near the airport we had the first night was reluctant to take us as people who had just checked out there were coming straight back from the airport to check back in. The hotel said we couldn&apos;t stay on but we have found a little apartment. It is a \u00a320 taxi ride from the airport and supermarkets and we need milk and nappies for Ashton,&quot; said Nikita, a 29-year-old trainee GP. &quot;I know the airline is in a difficult situation but there is no continuity between anyone there. Friends from home text and say to make a holiday of it but we can&apos;t. We can&apos;t relax and we are constantly on the phone waiting to find out what is happening and making sure we are still on waiting lists. It&apos;s really hard for Ashton, he&apos;s so restless and is not sleeping well.&quot; She is worried about work building up at the clinics where she works and for Chris, a GP in south-east London. &quot;Chris&apos; practice are being understanding but he would have had a fully booked working week. They are covering with a locum but then the question arises of whether he will have to take unpaid leave.&quot; \u2022 Moira Hickson, a 21-year-old student from Norwich, is stuck in a Moscow hotel room after trying to return home after visiting her aunt in Thailand. She is in contact with her boyfriend, Chris Thurmott, via email and the odd phone call. &quot;She got to Moscow on Thursday from Bangkok,&quot; said Chris. &quot;It was meant to be a three-hour wait for the transfer, but they found out that outside Moscow, British airspace was closed. As a result, they don&apos;t have visas.&quot; Moira and 30 others, most of them British, are being kept in a hotel in Moscow amid tight security. &quot;There&apos;s someone stopping them going downstairs or leaving the hotel. There are security cameras on only one floor in the hotel \u2013 the one where they are \u2013 and there are security guards guarding them 24 hours a day. They&apos;ve been pushed from pillar to post into the hotel. No one in the party speaks Russian and no one at the hotel speaks English, so they don&apos;t know what&apos;s going on. The British ambassador was allowed in [on Sunday]. The main problem is that they&apos;re not being allowed their luggage, which would allow them to have their toothbrushes and a change of clothes. Moira said that some of the people in the hotel have their medications in their luggage \u2013 because you&apos;re not allowed to take liquids in you hand luggage \u2013 and that they need it. They&apos;ve been given some deodorant, which made them smile because they can finally smell nice. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a very desirable position to be in. They&apos;re only allowed out \u2013 on to a balcony \u2013 for 15 minutes a day. I think Aeroflot didn&apos;t think it would last this long. It&apos;s just ridiculous, it really is. Someone had an asthma attack and the people at the hotel tried to give her medication without her mother&apos;s consent. But the medicine was out of date. When the mother saw that it had expired in 2009, she got upset and was physically restrained by a guard. Aeroflot have refused to sort out a train to try to get them out. They have offered flights to Rome and Nice, but after they get there, they&apos;re on their own. They&apos;re just getting people&apos;s hopes up. Moira sounded a bit weary, but they&apos;ve been trying to organise a quiz to keep their spirits up. People are just starting to crack.&quot; \u2022 Laura Shearer should be about to complete her degree in film studies and English literature at Queen&apos;s University in Belfast. But instead the 21-year-old is stuck in Beijing, worried she may not return in time to finish crucial assignments. &quot;I&apos;m in my final year and basically if I don&apos;t get home I won&apos;t graduate in June \u2013 I have deadlines for the start of May and exams from mid-May. That would mean the place I have on an MA programme would have to be deferred for a year,&quot; she said. Like her friends, she is anxious that even if she gets home soon she will be jetlagged and have lost precious revision time. Shearer travelled to Beijing on the three-week government-funded Study China programme and was due to return this weekend. But the earliest dates for rescheduled flights are in early May, and Shearer says she has been unable to get any information about when she can travel. &quot;British Airways turned me away when I went to the airport on Saturday \u2013 they told me to contact my travel agent at home,&quot; she said. Chinese organisers have offered extra language lessons to those who stay in the city, but the student is hoping to make the best of the enforced delay by visiting Shanghai. &quot;When we have got visas sorted out we are planning to travel \u2013 but that all takes money. After this I won&apos;t be able to [afford to] travel for a long, long time, so I might as well use my savings,&quot; she said. In the meantime, five of the female students are crammed into a room meant for two because they are running short of money. Even if she gets home soon, her studies could still be disrupted, she added. &quot;I&apos;ve contacted my lecturers \u2013 and some of them are stuck in Los Angeles.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-04-19T17:16:11Z", "tags": ["Iceland volcano 2010 (Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull)", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Transport", "Rail transport", "Road transport", "Air transport", "UK news", "Travel", "Flights", "Rail transport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/19/volcanic-ash-stories-from-stranded", "title": "Volcanic ash: stories from the stranded", "sentences": ["&quot;She got to Moscow on Thursday from Bangkok,&quot; said Chris."]}, {"article": "Relaxing in the cafeteria of Calais ferry terminal with a bottle of Ch\u00e2teau le Bos and a baguette yesterday afternoon, Jonathan Simms was distinctly nonplussed by the news that HMS Ocean might soon be steaming to his rescue on the prime minister&apos;s orders. &quot;Sounds a bit like Dad&apos;s Army to me,&quot; said the management consultant, who had driven through the night from Rome after jetting in on the last flight to Europe from Bangkok. &quot;Is Nick Clegg going to up that?&quot; His wife, Sue, was equally unimpressed to hear the ship was bobbing off the British coast, awaiting orders, and that the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal was sailing south from Scotland, ready to join the mooted rescue effort if required. &quot;We don&apos;t need a battleship,&quot; she said. &quot;Wouldn&apos;t mind the royal yacht, but of course we don&apos;t have that any more.&quot; Frank Reynolds, sitting with his son, daughter and wife, was of a similar opinion. The Londoner had heard of the naval plan, but had made &quot;a calculated decision&quot; to take the ferry regardless. &quot;It&apos;s never going to get in there; it&apos;s too shallow,&quot; he said, gesturing to the Channel port through the window. &quot;Which of the three is leading on this then? Brown should be paying for all the ferries too. That&apos;d win him a few votes.&quot; Keith Marley, who had travelled back from Germany in a newly purchased 30-year-old Volkswagen, agreed. &quot;It could well be a bit of a publicity stunt,&quot; he said. &quot;But the government better watch out, because it could backfire and people are going to ask questions about who&apos;s paying for it. I mean, is it the taxpayer?&quot; Perhaps they need not have worried. Phil Boyle, the British consul general in Lille, said the naval rescue was only &quot;one of a number of options we&apos;re considering to help British citizens&quot;. And defence officials said last night that using the navy to bring people home would not be a simple operation, adding that no detailed plan was in place anyway. The tired and financially depleted hordes who descended on the northern French port were also unmoved by the news that Britain was planning a gradual reopening of its airspace today, as they waited to pay \u20ac65 (\u00a357) for a SeaFrance or P&amp;O crossing that would normally have cost far less. Chris Panteli, a business consultant heading home with his wife and three children after their flight from Spain was cancelled, recited all the extra costs rained down on him by the ashes of Eyjafjallajokull: &quot;\u20ac200 for the hire car. \u20ac140 to get across the border; \u20ac300 to get to a hire car place; \u20ac450 to get to Calais. Now another \u20ac300 for the ferry. I&apos;m almost home,&quot; he said. &quot;But I&apos;m broke.&quot; Around the terminal, as luggage piled up and parents struggled to control young children, most people managed to remain buoyant in the face of chaos. &quot;I started in Canc\u00fan,&quot; said Jay Woods, 33, whose transfer flight from Madrid fell victim to the ash cloud. Despite arriving alone in the Spanish capital, he had teamed up with friends via Facebook and hatched a plan to get them home. &quot;We paid an extortionate amount of money for what was probably the last hire car in Madrid,&quot; he said. The journey \u2013 split between three \u2013 came to \u20ac1,200. Around the terminal people recounted acts of kindness. The men from Romford had been driven to Calais by &quot;a Serbian guy&quot; they had never met before. Samir Pilav and his wife, Zeljka, who have lived in Derby for 16 years, were given a lift from Croatia by a friend. &quot;He drove us 20 hours without a break,&quot; said Zeljka. &quot;Through Slovenia, Austria, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and France.&quot; The afternoon, however, was not without its tensions, especially when passengers discovered the price of the ferry. &quot;This is 100% exploitation,&quot; said Michael Errington, a film producer. &quot;This is triple what they usually charge. It&apos;s a disgrace.&quot; Hard currency seemed to be the best way to cut through the crisis: a party of Italians left stranded at the end of a skiing holiday near Tromso in Norway was reported to have hired a taxi to drive them home to Milan. The Norwegian daily Aftenposten said the 10 Italians had set off on Sunday in a people carrier supplied by a cab firm in Tromso which also provided them with three drivers to take turns at the wheel. The shortest route to Milan is more than 2,200 miles and runs through five countries apart from Norway and Italy. The Italian news agency Ansa said the taxi company had estimated that, by the time the party reached Milan, the meter could be showing anything from \u20ac14,000. The holiday companies Thomson and First Choice said they were laying on coaches to bring 5,000 customers home from Alicante and Malaga. Hundreds of holidaymakers who made their way to the north coast of Spain in the hope of catching a boat home were rewarded last night with a place on one of a few weekly ferries which cross the Bay of Biscay to the UK. Brittany Ferries&apos; Pont Aven departed Santander at 5.30pm (4.30pm BST) with more than 1,800 people for the 25-hour crossing to Portsmouth. Hundreds had turned up without tickets. Derek Doyle of the UK consulate in Bilbao said: &quot;Many had been waiting for four or five days and had crossed Spain to get here. They included a family travelling from Peru who came via Madrid and a woman travelling from LA.&quot; Hopeful passengers continued to trickle into the terminal, even as the ship was leaving port. &quot;We set off at 6am from M\u00e1laga and had been driving for 12 hours to get here,&quot; said Dave Brinicombe, from the Lake District, who had been on holiday in Andalucia. &quot;We&apos;ve missed today&apos;s boat, but we got a place on Wednesday&apos;s. We had been due to fly back last Thursday from M\u00e1laga. We had already checked in when the flight was cancelled.&quot; Some of those languishing in terminals much further from home were beginning to fret about the delays. At least 50 students in Beijing and Hangzhou on a language programme feared they would remain in the Chinese capital for the foreseeable future. Many face missing essay deadlines and exams and are worried about the extra cost. &quot;It&apos;s a government-funded programme so it&apos;s meant to include people from all backgrounds,&quot; said Monica Black, a second year English literature student at York University. &quot;We just had to pay for flights and visas, but now we are having to pay for accommodation and living costs. A lot of people have already spent to the max.&quot; &quot;We&apos;re really appreciative of being here; the government has done so much,&quot; said Danielle Dodds, a second year forensic science student at Northumbria University. &quot;[But] people are starting to panic.&quot; In Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport Granville and Angela Harris from Birmingham were told the first Thai Airways flight they could be booked on was on 4 May \u2013 15 days away. &quot;I just fainted, just from the sheer shock,&quot; said Angela. &quot;This has become a nightmare.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-04-19T23:07:08Z", "tags": ["Air transport", "Travel", "Iceland volcano 2010 (Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull)", "World news", "France", "UK news", "Transport", "Europe", "British Army"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/apr/20/europe-travel-british-holiday", "title": "Europe travel: Trains, boats but no planes \u2013 the long struggle home", "sentences": ["&quot;Sounds a bit like Dad&apos;s Army to me,&quot; said the management consultant, who had driven through the night from Rome after jetting in on the last flight to Europe from Bangkok.", "&quot;[But] people are starting to panic.&quot; In Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport Granville and Angela Harris from Birmingham were told the first Thai Airways flight they could be booked on was on 4 May \u2013 15 days away."]}, {"article": "     6.04pm:  That&apos;s it for today, just time for a bit of a round up: Eurocontrol, the European air traffic control agency, said 21,000 of the continent&apos;s 28,000 scheduled flights were going ahead Wednesday. Almost all restrictions in Europe have been lifted by air traffic controllers, however there remain some closures of airspace over parts of Britain, Ireland and France. Elsewhere today Giovanni Bisignani, head of the International Air Transport Association, called the economic fallout from the six-day travel shutdown &quot;devastating&quot; and urged European governments to examine ways to compensate airlines for lost revenues, as the US government did following the 11 September 2001 attacks. He said it would take three years for the industry to recover from the week of lost flying time. Airlines lost $400 million each day during the first three days of grounding, Bisignani told a news conference today. At one stage, 29% of global aviation and 1.2m passengers a day were affected Back in the UK the transport secretary, Andrew Adonis, has denied that the government decided to reopen the skies to air travel under pressure from airlines. &quot;They have obviously wanted to be able to fly their planes of course they have but that has not been the issue at stake here,&quot; he told the BBC today. And a last bit of travel advice - both the Heathrow and Gatwick express will be running throughout the night to ensure passengers affected by flight restrictions can make it to and from the airports.

Consumer group Which? while recognising no one could have foreseen the last week when the rules were drawn up, told my colleague James Meikle this evening: &quot;Without legislation we would have thousands and thousands of people stranded abroad without means of getting home, and without being looked after.  &quot;While we understand airlines are not to blame for anything that has happened over the last 7 days, passengers are consumers, and they need to be protected when something goes wrong.&quot;  5.54pm:  TUI Travel, whose chief executive earlier today described the governments response to the crisis as a &quot;shambles&quot;, (see 2.20pm) has calmed down. Dan Milmo&apos;s just forwarded me this statement:  &quot;Today, TUI Travel PLC and Thomas Cook Group PLC held a constructive meeting with the Transport Secretary which focused on the repatriation of stranded customers following the closure of airspace as a result of volcanic ash. We are pleased that Lord Adonis has recognised the importance of repatriation and the efforts we have undertaken in this area. We welcome the call for similar efforts across the rest of the travel sector. Separately, the companies have met with the Civil Aviation Authority and recognise their efforts in engaging with manufactures which has resulted in the new guidance issued yesterday, that has allowed air space to reopen.&quot;  And now they&apos;ve stopped criticising the government, transport secretary Andrew Adonis has recognised the &quot;great efforts&quot; made by travel companies. His statement:  &quot;I recognise the great efforts that tour operators are making to bring their customers home as quickly as possible and I want to see similar efforts made across the rest of the travel sector.&quot; &quot;Tour operators make a huge contribution to UK Plc. I have held productive discussions with the industry leaders today and will maintain a continuing dialogue over the coming hours and days.&quot;   5.40pm:  Severin Carrell has forwarded a statement from Highlands &amp; Islands Airports - which runs all Scottish airports north of Aberdeen and Glasgow - that serves as a reminder that the ash isn&apos;t completely gone yet.  &quot;HIA regrets to advise that all scheduled Loganair services from the current time until at least 13:00 hrs local time on Thursday, 22 April have now been cancelled. &quot;The continued presence of significant levels of volcanic ash in many parts of Scottish airspace \u2013 including &quot;no-fly&quot; zones ordered by the CAA and National Air Traffic Services which now cover Stornoway, Shetland and Orkney \u2013 and the forecast for tomorrow shows no material change for Loganair&apos;s operations.&quot;  &quot;This means all its islands services to the Inner Hebrides, Western Isles and northern Isles have been cancelled,&quot; says Severin.  5.24pm:  My colleague Andy Pietrasik emails:   EasyJet will today and tomorrow operate 15 special rescue flights to and from the UK to bring home passengers whose flights have been cancelled over the last week due to airspace closure. The airline has chartered additional aircraft over the next few days to collect passengers from Sharm El Sheikh, Madeira, Malta, Malaga and Alicante from its UK hubs. It says this will allow it to carry an additional 3,000 passengers who are stranded abroad. The flights are only for passengers who have previously had their booking cancelled. They should go to easyJet.com and log into the &quot;My easyJet&quot; section to transfer on to the new flights.   5.06pm:  Upbeat video/slideshow from fionahawthorne charting her family&apos;s journey to London from the south of Spain via &quot;hire car, coach, metro, train and ferry...&quot;  Set to the music of &apos;Red Plastic Bag&apos;.             .  4.38pm:       Sam Jones has been talking to people at Heathrow:  &quot;Mick Cutler&apos;s journey home may not have been quite such an odyssey, but the event that preceded it certainly was. Cutler, a 38-year-old NCO in the RAF, had just finished a 14-day, 1607-mile bike ride from San Diego in California to Galveston in Texas with five air force friends when the cloud put paid to their homeward plans. &quot; We should have been flying back on Saturday, but we got out in the early hours of Tuesday and we missed the open airspace last night and got diverted to Nice. Then we were put up overnight in Nice and looked after very well by BA. Being away for three weeks with a family waiting at home was tricky, then there was the uncertainty of not knowing when we would get here. We just had to make the best out of a bad situation really, but we were all anxious to get home as quickly as possible. British Airways picked up a lot of it. They were looking after us but there were the odd bits and pieces \u2013 like toiletries \u2013 that we had to buy, and obviously there was our washing and things like that. I probably spent about $150 and then about 100 Euros in Nice as well. I&apos;m looking forward to meeting up with the family. I&apos;ve got two young boys who kept asking when I was coming home. I&apos;m lucky that I have a very understanding wife. She&apos;s over the moon now.&quot; The scene upstairs in departures, under Terminal 5&apos;s massive steel and glass roof, was a little different. Huge electronic screens advising people to check their flights online did not seem to have stopped hundreds of travellers from turning up and trying their luck. Others had no choice. Conrad Seidel, a 23-year-old student from Stuttgart, was passing the time by playing slaps with his new friend Anna Schwalm, 20, from Frankfurt, who he had met while they were stranded in Vancouver. Although they were on the first flight back into Heathrow last night, which touched down at ten to 10, the young Germans were still a little way from home. &quot;We were always on standby in Vancouver - for five nights,&quot; said Conrad. &quot;We got here on the first flight \u2013 at 10 o&apos;clock last night. I should have been at university a week ago; I thought I&apos;d get there last week, but I got stuck. We slept here last night.[British Airways] gave us blankets and I wrote all my professors and they said it was fine. We&apos;re exhausted. I really want to emphasise that BA did a great job. It wasn&apos;t their fault \u2013 it wasn&apos;t a strike or anything. They kept us up to date and gave us a hotel and food vouchers and came to out hotel to tell us what was happening. British Airways honestly did a really, really good job. I would definitely go with them again. Other airlines just said: &apos;Ring this number.&apos;&quot;   4.22pm:  My new Twitter friend lefran, stuck in Japan, has some advice for anyone trying to get hold of KLM:      @lefran @adamgabbatt nothing worked for me until i contacted KLM on twitter, i&apos;d suggest everyone flying with KLM to get in touch with them on twitter because it took me 2 hours to get hold of them on the phone for them to say they wouldnt help, 10 minutes on twitter!  4.12pm:  Just been on the phone to the Guardian&apos;s Sam Jones, who&apos;s been at Heathrow Terminal 5 today.  &quot;The Sun has a couple of &apos;page 3 stunners&apos; welcoming people back into the country and giving them a little carrier bag with a copy of the Sun in.  This afternoon I met people who got the first flight in from Vancouver at 9.50pm last night, but were still having to rough it in the airport until they could catch their next flight out.  It doesn&apos;t feel very busy at all in arrivals, photographers and members of the press aside, but it&apos;s a bit busier upstairs in departures. But overall it&apos;s very calm, with not many people about.&quot;   4.01pm:  James Meikle has forwarded me a handy FAQ by Stewart John, Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering and past President of the Royal Aeronautical Society. &quot;The problem is like riding a motorbike with your mouth open and seeing how many flies you catch.&quot; \u2022 How do we know how much ash an engine can cope with? &quot;No-one knows the answer to this. The problem is like riding a motorbike with your mouth open and seeing how many flies you catch. Some ash will go straight through the engine without having any effect whilst some will get caught up. The speed, density of ash cloud, size of ash particles, temperature and wind all have an impact \u2013 in short there are just too many variables and it&apos;s extremely difficult!&quot; \u2022 Does ash affect the fuel efficiency of an engine? &quot;Ash only affects fuel efficiency if it starts clogging up the airways. The engine would fail before fuel efficiency became a real problem.&quot; \u2022 What has been learned from the test flights? &quot;Everything! They are what have shown that the flights are safe. They are the ultimate practical test and if there can be any criticism of this it&apos;s that there weren&apos;t test flights being done under controlled conditions right from the moment this crisis started.&quot; \u2022 On what evidence are the new CAA rules based? &quot;They&apos;re based on the results of the test flights. It&apos;s essentially a case of suck it and see.&quot; \u2022 What ash-damage checks will airlines have to make? &quot;Ash-damage will be checked extremely carefully. From the outside they will look at the fuel, air and oil filters. As well as this they will use borescopes to assess any internal damage to the engine. They have very sophisticated methods for doing this now and engines are designed with holes for borescopes for use in routine inspections. All these tests are objective tests that can be tested factually rather than subjective ones, so it&apos;s extremely rigorous.&quot; \u2022 Why can we fly now when days ago the advice said &apos;no tolerance for any ash whatsoever&apos;? &quot;The rules that said don&apos;t fly through ash were put in place a long time ago and it&apos;s basically been a case of updating them. You&apos;ve got to remember that thirty years ago no-one would have considered flying a twin engine across the Atlantic \u2013 you&apos;d have had to have four engines. New rules were made as part of EROPS (Extended range over water Operations) and at first twin-engine aircraft were never allowed to be more than 60 minutes from land, then 90 and eventually 240. Recently I was in a twin-engine plane that made the 16 hour flight to Hong Kong. Even 10 years ago we&apos;d never have done this. We&apos;d never faced this ash scenario before and it&apos;s been a case of learning to update \u2013 rules change as we get more confident and learn more about what we can do. It&apos;s just like a baby learning to walk. You move with the times as you gain confidence.&quot;  3.51pm:       Severin Carrell has an update on the situation in Scotland:  Aberdeen airport is still &quot;very much open and operational&quot; despite a new flying ban now affecting northern Scotland and the North Sea, a BAA spokeswoman has said.Three airports, on Orkney, Shetland and at Wick in Caithness, have been closed since 1pm after national air traffic control warned of a new ash cloud. The same plume led North Sea helicopter operators to suddenly ground all their oil and gas platform flights from Aberdeen after two Bond helicopters found ash coating their windscreens.But Sarah Campbell, a BAA spokeswoman at Aberdeen, said that only the far north of Scotland was affected; helicopter flights had now started again to the east and south-east. The only passenger flights grounded were to Lerwick, Kirkwall and Wick.&quot;Aberdeen airport is still very much open and operational. This afternoon a couple of routes have been affected by conditions to the north so there have been some cancellations but the majority of our routes are normal just now,&quot; she said.   3.39pm:  The Board of Airline Representatives in the UK, which represents over 90 airlines, has called on the UK government to tackle the EU Commission over unfair EU Regulations against member state airlines. Mike Carrivick, BAR UK chief executive, said today that regulation that forced airlines to provide for passengers during the disruption should not have been applicable in this case. He said the regulation was never meant to &quot;wholesale shutdown of the airways system imposed by governmental rulings and without any limitation of time&quot;. Full statement:  &quot;The eagerness of the EU and the UK government to publicly state that airlines have a responsibility under EU Regulation EU261/2004, to accommodate and feed passengers booked on flights cancelled by the volcanic disruptions, is a misuse of the regulation. &quot;Regulation EU261/2004 was intended to apply when airlines had individual delays or cancelled flights. It was never intended to apply to wholesale shutdown of the airways system imposed by governmental rulings and without any limitation of time. It is also relevant that airlines cannot immediately resume normal services from the moment that the airspace restrictions are lifted. This Regulation, when used in this way, is draconian, disproportionate and often impractical. &quot;In this particular situation, passengers have in all probability been delayed a lot longer than they might have been and airlines have lost millions every day as a result.&quot;   3.31pm:      Matthew Weaver    &quot;Thomas Cook has confirmed that one of a rescue flight to Crete had to return to Manchester airport today after a technical fault. It insisted that the reason for the return was &apos;purely a precaution&apos; and had nothing to do with ash, but the pilot remarked on the &apos;intense&apos; smell of volcanic ash before the flight was sent back.  &apos;For information we got the smell of the ash from about 16,000ft in the climb,&apos; the pilot said in a recording spotted by Airline Industry Review.  A Thomas Cook woman said: &apos;Safety is of paramount importance to us so when the Thomas Cook Airlines TCX 952P developed a minor technical fault with its air conditioning, we took the decision to return the aircraft to Manchester as a precautionary measure. The development of the fault categorically had nothing to do with volcanic ash and whilst there were no customers on board, at no point were our crew or the aircraft in any danger. The plane will be back in service later today and will join the many Thomas Cook Airlines rescue flights currently returning stranded passengers to the UK.&apos;&quot;  3.27pm:       Stankle is unimpressed with Monarch:   @kimmiedunja  I dread to think what would have happened were she with Ryanair/easyjet I&apos;ll tell you; a friend of mine had her return journey to portugal booked through Monarch. When flights were first cancelled, monarch&apos;s response was &quot;you&apos;re on your own love - not our problem&quot;. Now flights have restarted - they kindly offered to fly her and her daughter back from portugal for \u00a31k.   3.21pm:  My colleague James Meikle has been given the latest figures on Heathrow&apos;s operations today.  Normally the airport would have 657 departures today, but the plan at the moment is for 422. It would normally have 655 arrivals, but the plan at the moment is for 343.   3.07pm:       kimmiedunja comments on the TUI/Thomas Cook criticism of the government (see 2.20pm):  Have to say I&apos;m with the TUI bosses here. Mum and her husband have been stuck in Cyprus with Thomson and although they haven&apos;t had much information from the tour operator they have been extremely well looked after: staying at the same (posh) hotel rather than being downgraded to save Thomson money, moved from half to full board, and increased entertainments etc to keep the stranded happy. My maternal grandmother was rushed to hospital whilst mum was away, and she has been duly anxious - so Thomson have ensured she&apos;s on the first flight back, and should land at Manchester in a couple of hours. I dread to think what would have happened were she with Ryanair/easyjet.   2.58pm:      Matthew Weaver    &quot;Here&apos;s a great idea for anyone who&apos;s bored waiting for a plane: Andrew Losowsky, currently stranded in Dublin, is trying to put together a magazine written by and for &quot;fellow strandees&quot;. Working titles include Grounded, SkyFail and Someday We&apos;ll Fly Away.  Blogging from the airport he writes: &quot;If all goes well, the results will be published, probably via MagCloud and/or the Newspaper Club, and any proceeds sent to a charity that helps mitigate the effects of climate change on human populations. After all, we have to repent somehow. Who&apos;s in?&quot; Strandees are invited to answer four questions.&quot;  2.53pm:  jmbriggs, first name John, has been keeping a video diary of his volcano-affected journey from Riga to London on YouTube. Here&apos;s an entry from the room of his ferry from Lithuania to Germany. John suspects his travel companions have been accusing him of sounding like a warthog, which seems a little unfair.             Elsewhere the Guardian has a gallery of images taken as flights resumed today.  2.39pm:  Guardian travel editor, Andy Pietrasik, emails:  Iceland Express has started to resume flights between Reykjavik and London. Iceland Express was the first airline to leave London Gatwick at 01:35 on 21 April 2010. The flight carried 62 passengers to Keflavik Airport, Reykjavik, onboard a Boeing 757-200.   2.36pm:      Matthew Weaver    &quot;Gordon Brown appeared to hint that some night flights, or a relaxation of flight time rules, might be possible to get stranded passengers back. &apos;Now it looks as if we can get lots of people back, and I think you&apos;ll find our airports are open longer to make that possible,&apos; the PM said at an election meeting in Cardiff recorded by ITN. He was also evasive about those illusive coaches in Spain. &apos;There are coaches for people in Spain if they need it, but most people will want to come back via the airline or the charter that they have already booked,&apos; he said.&quot;             .  2.33pm:  National Express is providing nearly 3000 coach seats to/from Dover and London today, a press release has just announced. &quot;A new 24-hour coach operation has been put in place tonight from Dover to help those arriving from Calais throughout the night to get home. 20 different departure times will depart to London where onward UK connections can be made.&quot; Here&apos;s the timetable for services from Dover to London: 0455, 0525, 0625, 0725, 0835, 0930, 1015, 1115, 1215, 1315, 1415, 1515, 1615, 1715, 1825, 2010, 2200, 0000, 0200, 0330 For people aged 16-59 it&apos;s \u00a313.90, a spokeswoman has just told me. Under 16s, people 60 and over and disabled can travel for \u00a36.95. The coach brings you in to London Victoria, where &quot;connections to 1000 UK destinations can be made&quot;.  2.20pm:  Is the government letting Ryanair and easyJet get away with abandoning passengers? That&apos;s what TUI Travel and Thomas Cook appear to be suggesting, writes Matthew Weaver:     Matthew Weaver    &quot;The chief executive of TUI travel, which owns Thomson and First Choice, has described the government&apos;s response to the volcanic ash crisis as a &quot;shambles&quot; in a joint statement with Thomas Cook this afternoon. &quot;It became apparent that the government is condoning a two tier system between the way low cost airlines and airlines of holiday companies operate,&quot; the statement said. &quot;Some low cost airlines stated that their focus would be to commence normal flying schedules as soon as possible and made it clear that it was the government&apos;s responsibility to repatriate their customers. We believe this is a flawed and inequitable approach that is to the disadvantage of consumers.&quot; &quot;It is clear that the Government has put no pressure on low cost airlines to implement their own equivalent repatriation plans,&quot; the statement added. In the statement the two companies contrasted the conduct of low cost airlines with the efforts they have made to bring passengers home. &quot;TUI Travel and Thomas Cook immediately activated their crisis plans when the full implications of the volcano eruption became clear last Wednesday 14 April. Due to airspace being closed, over the weekend TUI Travel repatriated customers via coaches, ferries and owned cruise ships. First Choice and Thomson are now repatriating 21,000 customers today and 32,000 tomorrow with the remainder of its customers being repatriated by Friday.&quot; Peter Long, TUI travel chief executive said: &quot;The Government&apos;s response to the crisis has been a shambles. It is clear that they underestimated the severity of the consequences of the decision for a blanket closure of the airspace for such a protracted period of time.  &quot;This has been compounded by the fact that they have neither put in place a viable repatriation plan or ensured that the industry behaves in a consistent and responsible manner.&quot;  2.05pm:       Severin Carrell with the latest on the North Sea airspace:  North Sea helicopters have been grounded and flights from Aberdeen banned again after the ash plume shifted again, closing air space north east of Peterhead in north east Scotland. The North Sea helicopter operator Bond said two of its aircraft encountered ash in rain clouds 70 miles offshore: they landed to find a coating on ash on their windscreens, but there were no deposits in their engines. &quot;A no fly area has been imposed again,&quot; a Bond spokesman said. The new closure will increase pressure on the oil and gas industry&apos;s system of rotating workers on and off their platforms: for the last five days, many flights have been replaced by slower and more demanding boat trips to the rigs.   2.00pm:  Matt Weaver has spotted that the Foreign Office is using Twitter to offer guidance to Liverpool fans traveling to Madrid for the game.      @ukinspain #Liverpool_Atletico: We&apos;ll be tweeting advice for fans tomorrow so follow us on your mobile (check your operator&apos;s charges).  1.54pm:       Giles Tremlett, our Madrid correspondent at Barajas airport emails:  Foreign office minister Chris Bryant was one of the first members of the government to start flying today, reaching Madrid this morning to study the &quot;hub&quot; operation set up for stranded Britons in the Spanish capital.  Between ten and twenty coaches will leave from Madrid&apos;s Barajas airport Terminal 4 for Channel ports during the day.  &quot;I really don&apos;t want to pretend that we can do everything because we can&apos;t,&quot; Bryant told the BBC. &quot;The main thrust now has to be by the airlines and tour operators.&quot; The embassy has a desk set up in the departures hall where people are joining the queue to get on the buses. Passengers are a mix of those who have been stuck in Madrid for days and others arriving on intercontinental flights.  Two coaches have left already, with two to three drivers on each coach to go straight through to Calais. Free bottles of water, but no toilets on some of them. The drivers say it will take them around 17 hours to Calais.   1.50pm:  Severin Carrell emails to confirm North Sea helicopter flights have been grounded \u2013 showing the plume is heading south again, potentially affecting more services.  We&apos;ll keep you posted.  1.39pm:       Tommyben: &quot;If you have a long wait for a flight it might still be worth going by land and water as most trains and ferries have capacity. Have a look at www.flightlesstravel.com for some alternative travel routes.&quot; The FlightlessTravel website is worth looking at. They have tips on travelling by cargo ship, which sound great fun.  1.30pm:  Rail lines serving London&apos;s airports will stay open around the clock tonight to help get stranded air passengers home, Network Rail has announced. Weekend engineering work on the Anglo-Scottish routes - the east and west coast main lines - has also been cancelled to enable more direct services to run. Robin Gisby, from Network Rail, said: &quot;Network Rail and the train operators are doing all we can to help get people home following the unprecedented air travel chaos. The main lines to Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports will be opened round the clock tonight in an effort to speed people on their way.&quot; Paddington, Liverpool Street, Victoria and Gatwick - some of the UK&apos;s biggest and busiest stations - will also stay open around the clock tonight. So does this mean the tube will also be running, for the thrifts (like myself) who prefer to endure the hour-long Piccadilly? &quot;No,&quot; a spokesman for Transport for London has just told me. &quot;That&apos;s following consultation with the department for transport, and with other services like the Heathrow express, Gatwick express, etc, to understand what the demand is likely to be,&quot; he said. &quot;The tube runs up until midnight, and we did have plans in place to run the Piccadilly line into west London should that be necessary, but it does not appear, according to the Department for Transport, that there will be large numbers of people arriving overnight.&quot;  &quot;We do have an extensive night bus operation in London that will continue to operate, and we continue to monitor the situation. If the DfT ask us to run the service we will be able to do so.&quot;  1.18pm:      Terror as plane hits ash cloud [28 years ago]    How&apos;s this for responsible reporting? Copies of today&apos;s Daily Star have been removed from airport newsagent shelves over fears that its splash, headlined &quot;Terror as plane hits ash cloud&quot; with an image of a 747 with engines ablaze, could cause panic among travellers. Behind the headline is a picture of a Boeing 747, engines blazing. A picture which was taken from a TV reconstruction of an incident 28 years ago in which BA Flight 009&apos;s engines were knocked out by a volcanic ash cloud. Full story from John Plunkett.  1.12pm:  Good afternoon all, Adam Gabbatt taking over from Matt, who&apos;s gone for some soup. Right on cue, Severin Carrell calls back to elaborate on the airspace closures in north and west Scotland.  Airspace above the North Sea could also be closed to low level flights due to the volcanic ash, potentially affect the oil and gas industry.        12.54pm: Dan Milmo writes:  &quot;The head of the UK air safety body has denied that pressure from ministers and airlines contributed to the surprise lifting of a flight ban last night. Andrew Haines, chief executive of the Civil Aviation Authority, said it was &quot;absolutely 100% untrue&quot; that the independent regulator had been leant on.  In an interview with the Guardian he said the transport secretary, Lord Adonis, and airline executives had not forced the CAA into a hasty re-writing of long-standing guidelines on flying through volcanic ash. &quot;Lord Adonis has been fantastic because he is an intellectual and not an elected politician. He has understood the evidence, the data, and has been very supportive. He has never once put pressure us and likewise the airlines, who were anxious to get flying again but knew that we needed to have a safe method of working.&quot;  Asked if passengers should have any concerns about a new safety regime that permits planes to fly through low density ash clouds generated by Iceland&apos;s Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano, he added: &quot;I would happily fly myself. We have only taken this view after very detailed work by aircraft and engine manufacturers, in-flight testing and intensive investigations. All that data is saying that in low contamination areas it is very safe to fly.&quot; Planes are now taking off and landing at UK airports under a new carve-up of European Union airspace that divides the continent into three zones: a no-fly area; a safe flight region; and areas where flying is permitted despite the presence of ash.  Following intense discussions with engine and aircraft makers, British airspace that was unsafe under the old regime 24 hours ago was redesignated as acceptable for passenger flights. Haines admitted that it took a &quot;burning platform&quot; to focus the industry on an issue - flying through volcanic ash - that had not been examined in great detail previously by an industry whose overriding safety obsession in recent years has been terrorism.  &quot;It depends on how much priority people give to these issues. Some ICAO [the global aviation safety body] working groups go on for five years. Who would have thought that volcanic ash would have been one of their priorities?&quot;        12.44pm: There was a time yesterday when the only flights you could get in the UK were to the Scottish islands, today they are the only place you can&apos;t fly to and from. Could a new flights ban over the Scotland islands being heading south? asks our Scotland correspondent Severin Carrell:  The unpredictability of the Icelandic ash plume has just been underlined with the announcement that airspace over Orkney and Shetland has been shut down with immediate effect, leading to further delays and disruption for travellers and the oil industry. Highlands and Islands Airports, which operates nearly all regional and islands airports in the north and west of Scotland, has just released the following statement: &quot;Despite the widely publicised re-opening of UK airspace last night, National Air Traffic Services have issued directions in the last hour which indicate that the forecast concentrations of volcanic ash in the area around Orkney and Shetland are now expected to exceed safe operating limits between 13:00 and 19:00 today, Wednesday 21 April.&quot; So 15 flights linking Edinburgh and Aberdeen with Shetland and Orkneyscheduled for today have been abruptly cancelled.  Loganair, the main islands operator, is now offering passengers free tickets forrebookings. This closure raises the possibility of the flights ban being reimposed further south.   12.36pm: Airline acitivity across Europe, as tracked by flightradar24.com, is looking a lot busier than it has done over the last few days.      Screengrab from flightsradar24.com     12.06pm: More on the Madrid &quot;hub&quot; fiasco. The Foreign Office has just put out this statement:   &quot;Airlines have confirmed that due to flight restrictions being lifted from 2200 on 20 April, they will not now be diverting planes to a Madrid &quot;hub&quot;, but where possible flying direct to UK destinations. If you were planning to fly to the Madrid &quot;hub&quot; for onward transfer to the UK, you should now contact your airline for the latest advice about available direct flights. British Embassy staff are currently on the ground at the airport, helping passengers to find the best way back to the UK. The team&apos;s immediate priority is working with airlines and tour operators to get people on the first available flights to the UK. The Embassy team will be reinforced by more staff later today. Due to the earlier contingency planning, we have provision in place to allow us access to up to 150 coaches in and around Madrid. We are urgently assessing with the travel industry and our consular teams on the ground in Madrid how best to use this capability to assist British Nationals.&quot;   12.02pm: The airline industry is calling for a financial bailout and it appears to be trying to wriggle out of its compensation obligations to passengers.  &quot;This crisis is an act of god \u2013 completely beyond the control of airlines. Insurers certainly see it this way. But Europe&apos;s passenger rights regulations take no consideration of this. These regulations provide no relief for extraordinary situations and still hold airlines responsible to pay for hotels, meals and telephones,&quot; said Giovanni Bisignani, the director general of the International Air Transport Association.       11.43am: Michael Ellis, from Tettenhall in the West Midlands is stuck in Thailand, furious with the airline EVA, and looking for help. He emails:  My partner and I are stranded in Thailand. Today we were due to fly on the 11.50am EVA flight BR67. It was cancelled, but we were never called to try and standby for a later flight. In fact EVA have been nothing but unhelpful and their London team incredibly rude. We haven&apos;t yet been contacted concerning our return flight nor can we getthrough to reservations. We are now in Bangkok whilst political tensions increase in the city. Today we got caught up in a rally in Siam. We&apos;ve decided to move to Koh Chang, only an hour&apos;s flight from Bangkok, tobe safe and sound. EVA aren&apos;t helping with costs, but thankfully my insurance company are. We&apos;ve been told by other travellers that the soonest availability for a flight home is early May! I have already missed a flight on Friday to my best friend&apos;s wedding in Las Vegas, where I was supposed to be giving her away. Gutted and disappointed doesn&apos;t even cut it. I&apos;m stranded and need to get home. Please help?   11.31am: Five days of quiet skies has inspired some nice poetry and prose. Rural campaigners think we should be allowed to enjoy a world without planes every year. The experience of the last week has prompted the Campaign to Protect Rural England to call for a &apos;National Quiet Day&apos; . Graeme Willis, senior rural policy campaigner, explains:   &quot;This disaster has revealed to many what they&apos;ve been missing: overnight the skies were stripped of the sight and sound of aeroplanes, and without the rumble and drone of aircraft people are reporting they can hear the simple sounds of the countryside once more. &quot;Perhaps the time is right to consider a &apos;National Quiet Day&apos; to remind us all -for one day at least - of what we are all losing in our rush to be somewhere else. A planned approach to making all of our lives a little quieter and more tranquil could deliver some of the benefits of the last few days without the difficulties endured by so many people.&quot;   11.25am: &quot;Heathrow is starting to look like Heathrow again,&quot; according to Sam Jones at the airport with lots of hopeful passengers hoping to leave the UK.  11.16am: Guardian Daily presenter Jon Dennis was supposed to fly back from Barcelona on Friday. The ash cloud forced him and his young family to stay in a &quot;Swindon-by-Sea&quot; while they wondered how they&apos;d get back (as we heard on Monday 11.07am). Luckily they have just checked in for a return flight home. Jon describes his relief and the sense of solidarity among stranded Brits in Spain.  10.38am: The departure board at Heathrow still shows a rash of cancellations, according to the airline website Flightstats.      Screengrab from flightstats.co.uk          10.25am: Meanwhile, the Eyjafjallajokull volcano is still erupting, but is now producing less ash but more toxic gas, according to our science correspondent, Ian Sample. He writes:  The volcano is stable but remains active this morning, says Iceland&apos;s Civil Protection and Emergency Management Centre. The amount of ash being produced has fallen steadily over the past few days, but the plume is becoming more toxic due to higher levels of fluorine. The quantity of ash in the plume has dropped because the crater has become isolated from surrounding glacier ice. Most of the ash is produced when hot magma wells up and meets this ice and water.    10.19am: EasyJet says it plans to operate 900 flights (86% of its network) today. But it warns &quot;it will take several days to resume normal operations&quot;.      Adam Gabbatt     10.16am:  &quot;I&apos;ve just spoken with a press officer at BA. She said their longhaul flights are running as per BA&apos;s normal timetable this morning. So far both flights scheduled to take off \u2013 destined for New York and Tel Aviv \u2013 have done so. There could be some delays, she said, but all services should run. Short haul services will not run until 1pm today, however.  &quot;There&apos;s a lot of cabin crew and aircraft out of position,&quot; she said. &quot;We need to reposition the crews and the aircraft before resuming flights. Customers are still advised to check BA&apos;s website before flying, as there could be time changes and delays.&quot; She did say, however, that all short-haul services should be running after that time. In terms of BA flights in to the UK: again, short-haul services will only be operating from 1pm owing to repositioning, and services could be delayed. Long-haul flights will not be running normally inbound \u2013 because of diversions there will be delays \u2013 but should return to a normal service tomorrow. The latest information on flights will be posted on BA&apos;s website.&quot;  10.15am: Adam posts this Twitter exchange: @lefran @adamgabbatt I&apos;m stuck in Japan for another 9 days, no news on hotel or food budget or anything....impossible to get hold of call centers! @adamgabbatt @lefran ouch. Where are you staying for the next 9 days? @lefran @adamgabbatt my parents have had to snd me funds to check into a hostel. I now have little money left for food. Insrnce won&apos;t help me either       10.05am: Scores of Ryanair flights are still cancelled for tomorrow, including Helen Pidd&apos;s return from Berlin. Before heading for the railway station she emailed this:   My rearranged flight back from Berlin has been cancelled once again. I have thrown in the towel after five days waiting and I&apos;m going to get the train. Our environment colleagues will be glad to hear.        9.59am: What about those all those coaches in Madrid? Giles Tremlett, our correspondent in the city emails this:  I don&apos;t know what will happen to the &quot;Madrid hub&quot; idea for getting people stuck on other continents home via a long-distance coach service from Madrid airport. My guess is that, if it is not wound down, it will be used to try to help those stuck in Madrid and Spain already. There are plenty of them around. Online booking shops show flights available for today at \u20ac500 to \u20ac2,100 a shot but I am not sure I trust them. The first Iberia flight to London with free seats (\u20ac839) is, according to the company&apos;s own website, on Saturday. The first easyJet to London is on the 28 April. Yesterday the embassy desks at Terminal 1 and 4 were taking down mobile phone numbers of those stranded so that they could be called up when, and if, coaches became available. The first five coaches left last night with the ambassador, Giles Paxman, telling me this was &quot;just the start&quot; and that further resources would arrive today.       Adam Gabbatt     9.51am: &quot;Here&apos;s a breakdown of the financial impact of the volcano on various airlines. This is what some of the main carriers were losing at the peak of the disruption:  BA: \u00a315m-20m per day Easyjet: \u00a35m per day AirFrance/KLM: \u00a330.5m per day Emirates: \u00a36.5m per day Qantas: \u00a3900,000 per day TUI Travel (Owns Thompson and First Choice): \u00a36m per day Ryanair: \u00a35.2m European airports were losing around \u00a335m each day during the worst of the crisis. BAA, which owns Heathrow, Stansted, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Southampton, was losing \u00a35m-6m each day.&quot;  9.42am: It&apos;s remarkable that flights have resumed so quickly, says our transport correspondent, Dan Milmo. Aviation restrictions usually take years to draw up. &quot;Given that the solution we have found is flying through clouds of ash, I think the government was understandbly a little bit weary of pushing Nats and the CAA into letting aircraft take off again after a blanket ban was put in place,&quot; he says.  9.18am: The crisis has cost the airline industry $1.7bn, making it worse than 9/11 in economic terms, according to the International Air Transport Association. It is also calling for restrictions on night flights to be lifted to help airlines return to normality.  Announcing the estimate IATA&apos;s director general Giovanni Bisignani said: &quot;At the worst, the crisis impacted 29% of global aviation and affected 1.2 million passengers a day. The scale of the crisis eclipsed 9/11 when US airspace was closed for three days.&quot; &quot;As we are counting the costs of the crisis, we must also look for ways to mitigate the impact. Some of our airport partners are setting industry best practice. London Heathrow and Dubai are waiving parking fees and not charging for repositioning flights. Others airports must follow,&quot; said Bisignani.  8.56am:       Maev Kennedy&apos;s teenage son Samuel has made it back it from a school trip to China.  The 40 year-10- and 11 geography students from Orleans Park, and four teachers, who have been stranded in five star luxury in China, arrived back into Heathrow at 3.32am, to cheers from the parents and a furtive dab of teary eyes from their school head, Jo Longhurst.  Hours after their flight took off from Shanghai last night, it was still being suggested they might land in Scotland, or Amsterdam, or Barcelona. Samuel - who described the flight, &quot;I had dinner, and then I had another dinner, and then I think I had another dinner&quot; - is fast asleep in his own bed.  Jo Longhurst is wide awake, wrestling with the nightmare scheduling for her 1,000 pupil comprehensive - high spirited respondents to yesterday&apos;s news blog please note, not posh private - school: she still has 12 teachers astray in the world, including the head of maths who is in Tibet, and who was warned yesterday she may not be able to fly back until May 6.   8.45am: In Thailand there&apos;s been a massive scramble to get on the first flights back to the UK. Ben Doherty, our man in Bangkok, writes:   I&apos;ve just got back from Bangkok Airport where the first London-bound plane has left. It was EVA Air flight. There absolute chaos trying to get onto it, authorities basically rang everybody who had had a flightcancelled (with EVA) in the last six days and said get to the airport.  We have a flight leaving today. Everyone rushed madly and it was first-in, first-served. Some people, who had only been delayed a day got on, while others who were on the original plane turned back last Thursday, are still stuck in Bangkok. I talked to a young couple whose plane was the last one cancelled into London. They missed the cut-off by a couple of hours. They are now at the back of the queue waiting to get home.  If you are having trouble getting home please get in touch or leave a comment below. You can email me at matthew.weaver@guardian.co.uk or reach me on Twitter at @matthew_weaver  8.40am:The LibDems have also attacked the Tories for trying to politicise the travel chaos. Norman Baker, the party&apos;s transport spokesman, said: &quot;It&apos;s pretty reprehensible for the Conservatives to be almost gleeful about the chaos that there has been. The government is responsible for many things in this country but a volcano going off in Iceland is not one of them.&quot;  8.19am: The transport secretary, Lord Adonis, insisted that safety regulators have acted in an &quot;appropriate and and proper way throughout&quot;.  Speaking to the BBC&apos;s Today programme he denied that the government had put pressure on safety officials to change the rules. &quot;I believe that they [safety officials] have done their duty properly, and I would not have wished to place any pressure on them to have acted faster, than was compatible with the safe passage of planes,&quot; Lord Adonis said. On the delay in lifting the ban, he said it was right to wait for the results of observational data and the views of aircraft manufacturers. He said hew &quot;irritated&quot; by Conservative criticism of the government&apos;s handling of the crisis, and accused the Tories of &quot;playing party politics&quot; over the issue.  8am: Airlines have started the huge logistical operation of trying to return their flights schedule to normal after six days of restrictions were suddenly lifted last night. The first passengers arriving at Heathrow have described their relief at returning to the UK, but stranded passengers and those with bookings have been warned that the phased resumption of flights could takes days and even weeks.  There are lots of questions to answer and issues to be resolved including:\u2022 Were the volcanic ash restricitions necessary?\u2022 Is it safe to resume flights? \u2022 Did the airline bosses bully the officials into lifting the ban?\u2022 How long will it take to get stranded passengers home? \u2022 What happened to all those passengers who were told to head for Calais? \u2022 With planes out of position and restriction still in place, how long will it take for air traffic to return to normality?\u2022 How damaging has the crisising been to the airline industry?\u2022 Did the government do enough to help stranded passengers? \u2022 And how will we remember the days of quiet skies? As the recriminations begin the advice to passengers is to check with their airlines about flights.", "publicationDate": "2010-04-21T07:10:36Z", "tags": ["Iceland volcano 2010 (Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull)", "Air transport", "British Airways", "Travel", "UK news", "Iceland", "Airline industry", "Flights", "Europe", "Volcanoes"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2010/apr/21/iceland-volcano-uk-flights-resume", "title": "Iceland volcano - UK flights resume", "sentences": ["We are now in Bangkok whilst political tensions increase in the city.", "We&apos;ve decided to move to Koh Chang, only an hour&apos;s flight from Bangkok, tobe safe and sound.", "Ben Doherty, our man in Bangkok, writes:   I&apos;ve just got back from Bangkok Airport where the first London-bound plane has left.", "Some people, who had only been delayed a day got on, while others who were on the original plane turned back last Thursday, are still stuck in Bangkok."]}, {"article": " 8.10am: The focus of the story has shifted to a growing row over who should pay the compensation costs for the bills racked up by stranded passengers. The budget airline Ryanair has sparked fury by refusing to pay the hotel and food bills of those stuck abroad in the six-day shutdown. The stance flouts Europe wide-regulations on consumer rights for airline passengers. But there seems to be no way of compelling airlines to follow those regulations.  Thousands of passengers have returned, including those on board HMS Albion. But thousands more remain stranded, notably in south-east Asia where many have been told they won&apos;t get flights back until early May. Questions continue to be asked about the government&apos;s handling of the crisis. Were ministers right to tell passengers to head for Madrid and Calais, which turned out to be  travel bottlenecks, while negotiating a relaxation of the flight restrictions?  8.19am:       The Guardian&apos;s travel writer Benji Lanyado has been tweeting his epic journey back from Tangier. He&apos;s nearly home. Here&apos;s a selection from the latest stage from northern France to Kent, with pictures. Appropriately enough they were handing out Marathon-runner style foil capes to passengers at Calais.  Eurostar full for days. Driving straight to Calais.  Two hours from Calais. I hear tales of three-hour queues at the port anyway. Sounds like a very British rescue operation The ash refugees... Hundreds of Brits at Calais  Hundreds of people in foot passenger queue at Calais, but moving quickly. Waiting time two hours, ferries leaving every 75 minutes. Lots of TV crews here, just in time for the 10 O&apos;clock news! The Red Cross have arrived! Here&apos;s my girlfriend modelling the latest line of ash volcano refugee chic! F&amp;C Office officials ferrying the golden hordes The final leg is on, of all things, a double decker bus from Dover to London. Home.        8.52am: Tom Riley and his wife have been stranded in China since Saturday and his visa is about to run out. He emails:  After being no help at all and giving us no way to contact them, our airline (Finnair) have told us that 13 May is the soonest they can fly us back to the UK. We&apos;ve just been looking at alternative flights back to the UK and noticed that Finnair are selling tickets from Shanghai (where we need to fly from) to the UK on dates earlier than they have offered us. It seems obvious that they are not prioritising stranded passengers. The costs of my wife and I staying here are mounting and we need to get back to our jobs before our last few days of emergency holiday runs out, as does my visa. We have contacted the authorities and they have said that I will be fined for every day I am here illegally if it cannot be renewed in time. As airspace is opening up, expecting us to stay here for another three weeks at our own expense is ridiculous. Their website specifies they are not responsible for costs incurred as a result of the volcano, when EU law clearly states that they are. We were turned away from the airport with no help at all and told to check the website. Since then, all of Finnair&apos;s numbers in Europe have been recorded messages advising passengers to check the website, and that they cannot be contacted because they are too busy. I am currently on hold to their UK office, it&apos;s been 35mins so far, my wife is adding Skype credit to the account from another computer I use it on this one.   9am: The main political parties might have found an issue they can agree on: bashing Ryanair. Foreign office minister Chris Bryant told the Times: &quot;Most of the airlines have been exemplary. But many people feel badly let down by Ryanair for failing to let them know whether they are getting on a flight or not.&quot; Liberal Democrat transport spokesman Norman Baker issued this statement: &quot;Michael O&apos;Leary&apos;s outrageous decision not to compensate customers after the upheaval of the last week is a blatant defiance of EU consumer rules. &quot;This is shocking behaviour and rubs salt into the wounds for those who have been stranded overseas. This will make people think twice about travelling with Ryanair in the future.&quot;  9.11am: Jat Sahota is stuck in Dubai with hundreds of other Brits. He rang to express his frustration at the lack of information being offered by his tour operator \u2013 Virgin Holidays. &quot;My sense is that Virgin are focused very much on their own costs, rather than getting people home,&quot; he said.  9.21am: BA said it was operating larger aircraft on some routes and was also sending an extra plane to Antigua in the Caribbean tomorrow to pick up holidaymakers stuck due to the airports&apos; shutdown. A spokeswoman said: &quot;There will still be some disruption tomorrow and into the weekend as we get the schedules back on line.&quot;       9.26am: We are getting complaints about BA&apos;s operation in China. Stranded BA passenger Conor Mckee emailed:   On my way to Shanghai airport for 11am flight arriving London 4pm. I suspect I will be on my way back to my hotel though. Been stranded with a colleague for a week. Can&apos;t get hold of BA&apos;s China office and BA&apos;s website has no information. Seems like airports and airlines are in chaos unable to organise themselves to inform their customers. Is it that difficult to be decisive and to disseminate info?  Tom Bowen, another BA customer stranded in China, emails:  Like hundreds and thousands of passengers across the world, flight disruption has left me facing another night stranded in a hotel on the other side of the world. My flight BA1038 was due to depart from Beijing to London on the morning of 21 April, taking me home for the first time in two years. I am, in many ways more fortunate than most. I am familiar with the city, my girlfriend speaks the language fluently and her parents, who were due to visit Beijing, have been kind enough to let us use their hotel reservations since they themselves were also affected by flight disturbances.  There is a sense of camaraderie amongst those stranded here and the hotel have been exceptionally understanding about the situation and the changes we have made to the existing booking.  However, one institution has been neither helpful nor supportive and that is British Airways. Yesterday morning, after my flight was cancelled and after having spent \u00a310 and two hours on hold trying to speak to an operator, I went to BA&apos;s offices here in Beijing. The organisation was terrible, despite the obvious disruption to thousands of BA passengers; there was no queuing system, no information leaflets and only two customer service representatives. Yet, despite these failings, where BA really outdid itself by making sure these two lonely and overworked representatives were unable to speak English fluently and even worse were openly laughing at customers&apos; complaints.  Whilst I was trapped in this nightmare of customer &apos;service&apos;, my girlfriend went to the Air France offices, where she was greeted with a queuing system, comfy chairs set out to accommodate weary travellers and three senior representatives who not only spoke English but French and Chinese as well.  In the time BA served two customers Air France had managed to provide alternative travel arrangements for 10 stranded passengers.  Considering the extent of the disruption and the annoyance amongst many travellers at the airlines it seems unbelievable that BA didn&apos;t make a better effort to provide better customer service to its many disaffected passengers.  The next available flight I have been able to change onto is on the 8 May, 17 days after my planned departure date. Whilst BA are offering to compensate expenditure during this waiting period I first have to pay all expenses up front, leaving me in a far from ideal and financially damaging situation.        9.43am: John Lilley, another angry ash victim, emails with a gripe about car hire costs. He writes:   &quot;Just spent three days getting home from Norway. Highlight of this journey was Avis charging me almost \u00a3700 for one days hire of a Kia car. I take great exception to corporate exploitation of vulnerable people.&quot;   10.21am: Wow: Ryanair has caved in. Here&apos;s a snap from PA: Budget airline Ryanair today ended its defiance of EU regulations by agreeing to fully compensate its passengers caught up in the ash cloud crisis. Yesterday the Irish no-frills carrier&apos;s chief executive Michael O&apos;Leary said he would reimburse travellers only the original price of their air fare and no more. But today the airline said that it would comply with the regulations under which EU airlines are required to reimburse the &quot;reasonable receipted expenses of disrupted passengers&quot;.      Michael O'Leary, RyanAir boss Photograph: Carlo Cerchioli / G/N/Carlo Cerchioli / GraziaNeri    10.27am: Michael O&apos;Leary breaks the habit of a lifetime by backing down. Here&apos;s the Ryanair statement:  Ryanair confirmed this morning that it will comply with EU261 regulations under which EU airlines are required to reimburse the reasonable receipted expenses (as set out in EU261) of disrupted passengers. Under EU261 passengers are not entitled to compensation, as the closure of European airspace over the past seven days was beyond the control of European airlines.  And this is what O&apos;Leary said:   &quot;The events of the last seven days, under which Europe&apos;s airlines were prevented from flying by the closure of European airspace highlight how absurd and discriminatory the EU261 regulations are towards Europe&apos;s airlines. While competitor ferry, coach and train operators are obliged to reimburse passengers reasonable expenses, this reimbursement is limited to the ticket price paid to those operators.  Yet the airlines are required by regulation to meet potentially unlimited expenses, in circumstances where there has been a catastrophic closure of European airspace over the past seven days, as EU governments and regulators wrongly applied a blanket ban on flights over European airspace. Ryanair has long campaigned for these reimbursements under passenger rights legislation to be limited to the ticket price paid in the same way they are for train, coach and ferry operators. We will continue to work through the European Low Fares Airlines Association (ELFAA) and other industry bodies to persuade the European Commission and the European Parliament to alter this regulation to put this reasonable limit on these reimbursement claims&quot;.   10.36am: O&apos;Leary confirmed that Ryanair will reimburse &quot;reasonable costs&quot;, but he will challenge the regulations. But speaking to BBC News. &quot;The events of the last seven days have exposed just how ridiculous and absurd these reimbursement provisions are in the case of catastrophic seven-day closures like this,&quot; he said. He also revealed the crisis has cost Ryan \u20ac30-40m. Asked if Ryanair would make it difficult to make claims, O&apos;Leary said &quot;perish the thought&quot;.  Martha describes returning to England last night on board HMS Albion in this Audioboo interview. &quot;Getting everyone home was just a great feeling,&quot; she says       11.30am: Not everyone is fed up. I&apos;ve just been talking to Martha Rafferty, who was pictured on front of the Daily Mail yesterday boarding the HMS Albion at Santander.  She arrived last night in Portsmouth after leading a stranded Girl Guide group back from Morrocco.  Here&apos;s her account of the journey that she wrote on board the ship:  &quot;This has been one of the best sea voyages of my life. I was one of two leaders on the Girlguiding UK Centenary trip to Morocco that could not get home. We were due to fly back last Friday from Marrakech to Heathrow via Madrid.  We made it to Madrid but then got halted on our journey by the shutdown. I was sick to my stomach trying to figure the logistics of getting 17 people home some with severe medical issues that required hospital treatment in Madrid, thank goodness we contacted the consulate. Since they called back on Monday evening life has been easy if a little cramped. We left the consulate in Madrid and drove through the night to Santander and it wasn&apos;t until we drove up to the HMS Albion itself I believed it was real.  The crew have been wonderful and not once laughed at our ridiculous questions especially when we got lost. The bunks gave me the best night&apos;s sleep since we left home, though getting into the middle bunk did cause me some issues.  I am thankful for a lot, to the consulate for their organisation, to the troops we shared space with who were lovely despite all their months away, to the Navy for taking us not only home, but home in style.&quot;   11.41am: Colin Hind has copied us in on a letter he sent to BA&apos;s chief executive, Willie Walsh.  Re flight No BA54 at from Johannesburgh South Africa Thursday 15/4/2010 Dear Mr Walsh, Are your staff manipulating tired and disorientated passengers to avoid BA fulfilling its responsibilities? A group of students from Manchester University were due to leave Johannesburg on this flight. It was cancelled because of the Ash cloud. Since then the group have been given little or no information or have been misinformed by your staff. They have now been told that the group details have been lost from the system and they need to re-book. The next fight they could leave on would be 9 May 2010. I have left out much of the details of trips back and forth to the airport and the group&apos;s experience at the hands by your staff, however, I will be happy to provide details should you require them. Many of this group of students face exams in the near future. Clearly, this could have an outcome for their results to say nothing of the distress they are facing. What do you intend to do about it or are you just refusing to accept responsibility for the consequences of your business? Yours sincerely, Colin Hind       Lord Adonis, the transport secretary. Photograph: Tim Ireland/PA    11.45am: Transport secretary Lord Adonis, has welcomed Ryanair&apos;s climbdown. Here&apos;s what he said:   &quot;I welcome the revised statement by Ryanair confirming that they will meet their obligations to passengers.  The government and the Civil Aviation Authority have told Ryanair in the strongest terms that they are expected to pay the reasonable accommodation and food costs of stranded passengers, and that they should seek to get them back to Britain as soon as possible.   This applies to all EU airlines, and I will be equally forthright in defending passenger rights with any airline that seeks to avoid its obligations.&quot;   11.59am: Volcanic ash is still causing flight cancellations. Parts of Scandinavian airspace have been closed after a new cloud of the stuff wafted over. Here&apos;s a rundown of the current restrictions courtesy of AP:  \u2022 Finland: Most airports in southern Finland, including Helsinki Airport, are closed. Airports in northern parts of the country are open. International overflights allowed above 31,000ft.\u2022 Norway: A new wave of volcanic ash caused aviation officials to close airports \u2022 Sweden: All Stockholm airports and Malmo airport in the south are open. Airspace in parts of northern and western Sweden is closed although overflights at high altitude are permitted.\u2022 Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania: The airspace of all three Baltic countries is open, but some flights are still cancelled due to restrictions in other countries.        12.23pm: I&apos;ve been sent a fiery email about BA&apos;s handling of stranded passengers in Mumbai.  Erica Wald, reader in international history at the LSE, is trying to get back to London. She writes:   &quot;I&apos;ve just returned from my third round trip to Mumbai International Airport in my attempt to return home to London after my flight, BA 138, was cancelled due to the volcanic ash. It was a fairly depressing and enraging experience. BA told me yesterday after I finally got through to their India number, which I rang for 3 \u00bd hours, that the earliest I could go home was 6 May.  I miss my husband and I&apos;m concerned to be missing so much work at such a crucial time for my students who are due to sit their exams in May. I&apos;ve now been away from home for a month and a half \u2013 my flight to India was also cancelled by BA because of the strike.  Last night I heard BA were still SELLING tickets for flights from Friday, 23 April, so I decided to check for myself. Sure enough, there are seats on each of the two daily flights out of Mumbai, however, they are now asking nearly \u00a32,000 for a one-way ticket. I was so outraged by this blatant, greedy profiteering, that I decided to go to the airport this morning to try to get an answer from them. At the moment, the airport is filled with very upset stranded passengers in varying states of distress - I met a gentleman who suffers from diabetes and who is running out of medication and money. Moreover, BA has lost his suit case with his spare needles. They have not been offered any accommodation, so have been sleeping in the terminal. BA is not even offering passengers bottled water or food. And if you leave the terminal to find food they tell you that you will probably not be allowed back in. There was another passenger undergoing cancer treatment, whose medical needs were also ignored. Another one&apos;s wife is due to give birth in the next two days. Right now, BA is telling us that we have to find our own hotel, pay for it, and then claim compensation when we return to the UK. While I am lucky enough to have a hotel that held a room available for me many are not so lucky. The BA manager here has been ineffectual and rude, not giving passengers any information and denied that BA was still selling tickets (until I produced the print-out of the page where I was asked to enter my credit card details for the purchase). There was a very sweet bunch of backpackers who were booked on to today&apos;s flight and had come to say that they were willing to give up their seats for people who urgently needed to return home \u2013 they just asked BA to provide them a place to stay until there was free flight to get them home. BA refused. Apparently they were unwilling to lay out the cash to them and instead put them on the flight, leaving many desperate waiting passengers flabbergasted. While I appreciate that this is a difficult situation for airlines, they should have a duty of care to their passengers and after making record profits for years. It is hard for many of us, left thousands of miles from home, to understand the rationale behind not sending out extra planes to clear the backlog, as surely they would be full in both directions? I&apos;ve been very disappointed and upset with British Airways&apos; slapdash and frankly dangerous handling of this situation.&quot;        12.42pm: The situation for BA passengers in Dehli doesn&apos;t look any better. Helen Walker contacted us on behalf of her parents. She writes:  &quot;My parents are stuck out there and have been since their flight on the 19 April was cancelled. They have been told by BA they cannot fly back until the 10 May, making it a month they will have been stranded.  Even though airspace has reopened, BA have not put on any extra flights and are sending half empty planes back because unless passengers are willing to re book tickets in first or business class for around \u00a32,200 then they will have to wait weeks. Passengers are unable to get into the airport as it is being guarded by armed police and only bribes will get you into the airport. Last night, the first flight left Delhi with only two of the stranded on the plane. There are 3,000 people estimated to be stranded in Delhi so even a flight back on 10 May sounds unrealistic.  Tourists out there are worried they have been neglected by BA and will be forgotten when this story is no longer newsworthy in a few days&apos; time. They feel incredibly let down by BA who have said they will only help them with food and accommodation for three days. They are shocked no extra flights have been laid on, let alone that they are sending planes back with empty seats. It seems like BA are trying to recoup lost income by expecting people to pay extortionate sums to be upgraded and to get home sooner.&quot;   12.52pm: I&apos;ve just put some of the complaints from stranded passenger to BA&apos;s press office. A spokeswoman told me: &quot;This is a completely unprecedented situation. We are doing absolutely everything we can to help stranded passengers get back to the UK. There are a large number of passenger which every airline is trying to get back onto flights. That is difficult and it will take some time. &quot;So many people have so many reasons why they desperately need to get home. We are trying to prioritise in the fairest way possible. &quot;No BA passenger is being asked to pay any more money to get on a flight. We will put passengers in every seat possible.&quot;  1.14pm: Virgin Holidays says it will pass on Jat Sahota&apos;s complaints (see 9.11am) to their team in Dubai.  A spokesman said: &quot;Virgin Holidays continue to do everything we can to make arrangements for the return of customers who remain overseas but the repatriation effort will take several more days. In the meantime, we will continue to assist those customers by providing hotel accommodation and other support.  &quot;Our over-riding priority remains the welfare of our customers and to that end, Virgin Holidays is working round the clock, both on the ground overseas and here in the UK, to ensure our customers are kept as well informed and comfortable as possible. We appreciate that these exceptional circumstances have been challenging and we&apos;d like to thank them for their continued patience and understanding.&quot;  2.04pm: What&apos;s the reaction of Ryanair passengers to the O&apos;Leary climbdown? PA spoke Jennifer Sigg at Stansted: &quot;We were happy to know that we are going to be able to claim compensation but we weren&apos;t really expecting much. This is Ryanair. They are just a no-frills airline. We flew with them because they are cheap. I would not have expected them to cover extraneous costs. I wasn&apos;t aware of the legislation.&quot;  2.10pm: Here&apos;s that BBC interview with O&apos;Leary explaining his climbdown. He&apos;s going to reimburse (note: not compensate) passengers, but he also wants to sue the EU.  &quot;We recognise whenever I&apos;ve made a mistake and we try to correct those mistakes quickly,&quot; he said.   2.27pm: It&apos;s like a refugee camp for stranded passenger in Bangkok airport, according to Sheila and Carolyn, who are trying to get a Thai Airways flight back to London.   &quot;Against the advice of Thai airways we have come to Bangkok airport after the earliest confirmed flight Thai were able to offer us was 7 May. The situation here is appalling and especially grim for passengers trying to return to London. We&apos;ve been directed into a holding area in the basement of the airport for &apos;Victims of the Icelandic volcanic eruption&apos; - to get us out of the way of the main airport it seems. It looks like a refugee camp. People are using cardboard boxes as mattresses to sleep on.  It&apos;s not the end of the holiday we had expected, and it&apos;s beyond anything we have ever seen. People have been here since the first cancelled flight on 15 April and there is still no guarantee of a flight home for them. They will take priority over us as our flight was not until 19 April. Our estimate is that there are probably about 700 people down here, possibly more. There is British Embassy representation here, and they have told us that Lord Adonis is putting pressure on the Chairman of Thai airways to put on extra flights.  Facilities here are dreadful, although the airport authorities are providing drinks and snacks plus facilities for charging mobiles and using free internet (long queues). We have our name on a standby list for an 11.25 flight tomorrow. This is only for people at the airport so we feel for the moment we have to stay here. This may sound positive but we have come to realise that Thai staff only tell you what they want you to hear. We have met people who have been on a stand by list, or even told that they have a confirmed flight and it has all come to nothing. Thai will only fly us to another destination if we cover the cost of the onward journey ourselves. This might be an option (fly to Paris and get the Eurostar) if we cannot leave tomorrow. However these flights are also stand-by. Looks like a miserable night ahead. They have started giving out mattresses. Longing to be back home!&quot;   2.38pm: The Tories are making a bid for the stranded-passenger vote.  Theresa Villiers, Shadow transport secretary, said: &quot;A Conservative government would conduct a wholesale review of the rules governing compensation and travel insurance arrangements for air passengers. Current arrangements mean few passengers understand whether they are protected by compensation schemes or not.&quot; But will all those stranded be back in time to vote?  2.57pm: Stanley Johnson, Boris&apos;s Dad, has written up his account of being rescued by HMS Albionn, in the Standard. It&apos;s Boy&apos;s Own stuff: &quot;Soon after HMS Albion had put out from Santander into the Bay of Biscay, I found myself being invited to tea by Commander John Gardner, the executive officer in charge. &quot;I told him that, as we stuck our nose through the closed gates on the Santander quayside, we had been afraid that we would be left behind. Commander Gardner said masterfully: &quot;I was not prepared to leave any Brits on the jetty if I could possibly help it.&quot;  3.05pm: Ash flash from PA: Flight training on RAF Typhoon jets has been &quot;temporarily suspended&quot; after inspectors found deposits of ash in one of the fleet&apos;s engines, the Ministry of Defence said today.  3.12pm: The MoD is playing down the grounding of training flights. &quot;These are very high performance jets so they are just being extra cautious,&quot; a spokesman said. Safety inspectors took the &quot;precautionary measure&quot; to check all of the jets based at RAF Coningsby, in Lincolnshire, after findings small deposits yesterday he added.  3.21pm: You heard it here first (3.31pm). The Sun&apos;s website is splashing on an &quot;exclusive story&quot; about how a Thomas Cook flight had to return to Manchester airport after the pilot smelt volcanic ash. We had the story in yesterday&apos;s liveblog, after spotting it here. Here&apos;s the flight recording.  The empty rescue flight bound for Crete had to return due to a technical fault with the air conditioning. &quot;The development of the fault categorically had nothing to do with volcanic ash and whilst there were no customers on board, at no point were our crew or the aircraft in any danger,&quot; a Thomas Cook spokeswoman told me yesterday.  3.40pm: A BA cabin crew member reports being shown volcanic dust that had collected on the wing of a 747.  An anonymous post on the Bassa web forum, which is only open to BA staff, said:   &quot;Just arrived back today, 747, and yes indeed.. the engineer and captain showed us a thin layer of volcanic dust which had collected on the wing. Interesting eh? The aircraft needed an engine inspection to see how much had been taken through, and wasn&apos;t fit to fly until the debris was removed. If [Willie] Walsh went up on a cardiff flight the other day and everything was normal.. then my eyes via the engineer saw differently. I feel we were used as a test flight. Luckily we were safe.. but I am mad that there was obviously some risk to the engines and I&apos;m not happy about that.. there should have been no risk whatsoever. The airlines have pushed the commercial in front of safety. I am pleased the EU did the flight ban.. the scientists were right to advise accordingly , and in my opinion they did not over react. I am now concerned that there is still a risk factor involved where our plane can not fly onwards as a result of this.&quot;   3.52pm: More on the suspension of RAF training flights. My colleague Mark Tran has been talking to the MoD.  Ash was found on one of the jets which landed at Coningsby yesterday, a spokesman said. As a result seven Typhoons that were flying at the time are being checked by engineers. But operational flights from Coningsby are continuing. Tornado and Harriers were not affected.

My fear before this week&apos;s debate on foreign policy is that it will prove to be hemmed in by a similar consensus \u2013 even if it less obvious. For sure, there will be dividing lines on the surface. The Liberal Democrats can justly claim to have been right about Iraq, and they deserve credit for calling for the Trident replacement to be scrapped \u2013 no one believes that Britain would ever use nuclear weapons, but no major party has been brave enough to state the obvious conclusion that there&apos;s little point in having them, then, since Labour in 1987. But all three parties see foreign affairs through the prism of two relationships: that with America, and that with the European Union. No leader will want to see our alliance with the US become even less &quot;special&quot; than it already evidently is under Barack Obama. Likewise, no leader is arguing for any fundamental renegotiation of the UK&apos;s connection with the EU. Even Nick Clegg admits it is &quot;flawed&quot;, thus conceding that the British public does not share the Liberal Democrats&apos; historic Europhilia. The current stasis in EU institutions also makes it very easy for David Cameron to talk tough while not actually having to do anything. &quot;We do not want to join the euro,&quot; he said recently. &quot;We want to keep the pound as our currency. What the British people want is Britain in Europe but not run by Europe. They do not want a state called Europe.&quot; Luckily for him, neither Britain joining the euro nor a &quot;state called Europe&quot; are on the horizon at the moment.  What we almost certainly will not get during tonight&apos;s debate is anything resembling a full-scale re-evaluation of Britain&apos;s role in the world. And that will mask two important truths. First, that we vastly overestimate our importance, and have long done so. In The Post-American World, Newsweek International&apos;s editor Fareed Zakaria dates this back to the end of the second world war. &quot;The photographs of Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill at the Yalta Conference in February 1945 are somewhat misleading,&quot; he writes. &quot;There was no &apos;big three&apos; at Yalta. There was a &apos;big two&apos; plus one brilliant political entrepreneur who was able to keep himself and his country in the game, so that Britain maintained many elements of great powerdom well into the late 20th century.&quot; If that was true then, it certainly is now. UK ministers ought to pause to think before making weighty pronouncements of disapproval about how other countries run their affairs \u2013 partly because many states in Africa and Asia have had quite enough of being told what to do by Brits in the past, thank you very much; and partly because the reaction, frequently, is one of derision. Just why should a junior foreign office minister think an admonition from him is of any consequence half way round the globe? The other side of this, and the second important truth, is that while UK politicians never hesitate to criticise, they have consistently failed to appreciate the reservoirs of goodwill towards us that still exist in many former colonial countries. It is our immense good luck that many states that were invaded or exploited by the British remain very fond, not necessarily of particular UK politicians, but of a certain idea of what Britain stands for. From independence onwards, generations of politicians rose to prominence who were educated at UK universities, from BR Ambedkar, the great &quot;untouchable&quot; who was the main architect of the Indian Constitution (at the LSE), to the current prime minister of Malaysia, Najib Tun Razak (Nottingham \u2013 his father, also prime minister, went to Lincoln&apos;s Inn), while few potentates in former British possessions or protectorates have considered their offspring sufficiently trained for the throne until they have spent at least some time at Sandhurst, as did, for instance, King Abdullah II of Jordan and the Sultan of Brunei. Over the last 20 to 30 years, however, their successors have been just as likely to have gone to colleges in the US. Elites that were once predominantly Anglophile now share their affections with America (and to an extent with Australia). A clear advantage for British interests, influence and trade is diminishing, not least because our politicians&apos; eyes have seldom been on those parts of the globe. And it shows when they do visit these exotic and unfamiliar climes \u2013 such as when FO minister Kim Howells thought the best way to wrap up a trip to Kenya was to accuse the entire country of being on the take, or when David Miliband&apos;s time in India last year was branded a &quot;disaster&quot; by both ruling and opposition parties.  There is a world beyond Europe and America, and it is one with which we have deep ties of history, language and, indeed, blood \u2013 we owe much of Britain&apos;s ethnic diversity to these connections. This world is more pro-British than we perhaps sometimes imagine. One of the Abu Dhabi government&apos;s proudest cultural projects of 2008 was the opening in Al Ain of a permanent exhibition of photographs by Wilfred Thesiger \u2013 a British explorer.  There is such demand abroad for an old-fashioned British education that boarding schools have been opening branches thousands of miles away, from Harrow International School in Bangkok to Repton School, Dubai. British football teams inspire as much devotion in the tropics as they do in Old Trafford; it was no surprise that Manchester United&apos;s first caf\u00e9 store outside Britain opened in Singapore. A truly internationalist approach might begin by party leaders ceasing to be &quot;Little Europeans&quot; or &quot;Little Atlanticists&quot; and working instead to revive these affections. Too easily have politicians given up, for instance, on the Commonwealth, dismissing it as a &quot;talking shop&quot; \u2013 thereby undervaluing the virtue that activity has on its own and failing to recognise that a conversation is a very good starting point for something more concrete. But will we even hear about it on Thursday? Or will the US, EU and Nato dominate the discussion? It would be a shame if it were so. For that would be to confine the debate to the interests of a mere billion or so of the world&apos;s nearly 7 billion population.

The Thai capital is braced for a final violent showdown in coming days between red-shirted anti-government protesters, who have occupied the city&apos;s streets for nearly six weeks, and the army, which has warned troops could be sent in. Four explosions, believed to be grenades, rocked the financial district of Sala Daeng, killing one man, injuring more than 70 other people and damaging buildings. The man&apos;s death brings the number killed in the unrest to 26. It is not known who fired the grenades although the Thai government blamed the protesters. A 26-year-old Australian man was among the injured. The Foreign Office immediately upgraded its travel warning for British nationals, advising against all but essential travel to Bangkok. &quot;This advice reflects our concern for the safety of British nationals planning to travel to Bangkok, given the risk that violence could break out without warning during the increasingly volatile political crisis,&quot; the office said. Bangkok airport is operating as normal, but key parts of the city, in particular Sala Daeng and the shopping district of Ratchaprasong, are in the hands of the redshirts, formally known as the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship. They have surrounded their two protest sites with huge barricades built from bamboo sticks, tyres, razor wire and metal barricades, blocking off key roads. The redshirts, most of whom are from poor northern rural districts, oppose prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, arguing his government is illegitimate and a puppet for the interests of Bangkok&apos;s elite and the military. But in recent days new protesters have emerged on Bangkok&apos;s streets. In the chromatic language of Thai politics, they are known as &quot;multi-coloureds&quot; or &quot;colourless&quot;. Without uniforms, they oppose the redshirts&apos; occupation of the city and have taken to hurling abuse, bottles and rocks at the protest sites. Riot police and army troops were keeping the two groups apart. The army has been reluctant to move in on the reds after the failed effort to remove them a fortnight ago resulted in the death of 25 people, including five soldiers. But the army has warned its patience is wearing thin. Spokesman Sunsern Kaewkumnerd told protesters: &quot;We don&apos;t want you to risk your lives. If there is a clash you could be hurt by stray bullets. Your time is running out.

The airlines claim they are doing all they can to clear the backlog, but that is being challenged by passengers, who say they are being abandoned by the airlines. Here&apos;s a sample of the latest complaints. Dr Saleem Althaf, an accident and emergency doctor in Lincolnshire, is trying to get back from Chennai in India. He was booked on a flight on Wednesday that was cancelled due to the ash cloud. He was told by British Airways that the earliest he could get back was 10 May. But in the meantime BA have been selling tickets on earlier flights for around \u00a31,500.  &quot;I just found that incredible,&quot; he told me. &quot;I am incredibly angry at the way BA have been treating their customers.&quot; Listen to Saleem&apos;s story here: BA insists it is giving priority to stranded passengers and said it was deliberately selling tickets at higher price to &quot;discourage&quot; new customers.  In a statement it said:   &quot;Our priority is to get our stranded customers back home as quickly as possible after the six-day closure of UK airspace.  To protect seats for BA customers who had their flight cancelled because of the closure, we have priced all available seats at the highest fares specifically to discourage new customers from buying them.  We cannot restrict the booking system that sells BA seats to our call centres only. Seats must be open for sale to everyone, including travel agents, tour operators or other airlines.  We recognise that this policy may be frustrating for customers of other airlines who would like to return to the UK with British Airways.  However, we are in an unprecedented situation not of our making and our prime obligation must be to our own customers.  Existing customers who are rebooking face no additional charges.&quot;  The rationale for that system is lost on BA&apos;s stranded passengers, who complain they are still being denied places on planes. Erica Wald, a fellow in international history at the London School of Economics, is trying to get a flight back from Mumbai after a cancellation last week. She told us she was &quot;outraged&quot; to find BA offering tickets home for \u00a32,000 while being told she cannot return until 6 May (see 12.23pm entry). &quot;The BA manager here has been ineffectual and rude, not giving passengers any information and denied that BA was still selling tickets (until I produced the printout of the page where I was asked to enter my credit card details for the purchase),&quot; she said. BA customers Trevor and Juliet Donnelly, who are stuck in Dehli, say the airline&apos;s behaviour is a scandal. In a letter we published today they wrote:  &quot;We are trapped in Delhi with our children Iona (14 \u2013 missing GCSE exams), Sophia (13 \u2013 missing her part in the school play) and Dylan (seven \u2013 missing home). BA have offered us a flight home on 10 May (we have been stranded since 16 April), but are still selling tickets on Delhi-London flights for thousands of pounds (which we cannot afford). The rich are allowed straight on to flights while the poor remain stranded. This is the real scandal of the volcano crisis.  We are among the lucky ones who BA have put up in a hotel but, with spirits low and tempers high, trouble is brewing \u2013 some people even had a &quot;sit-down protest&quot; in the hotel lobby on Wednesday. The Ramada in New Delhi is a very nice hotel, but our money has run out and we can&apos;t even afford the bottled water.&quot;  BA is not the only airline facing customer anger at the sale of tickets for earlier flights. Tom Riley is having trouble getting a Finnair flights to the UK after being stranded in Shanghai since Saturday. He writes:   &quot;Eventually we got through to Finnair after holding for 45mins. Initially they weren&apos;t budging on the 13 May return date until we asked why they were selling tickets for the start of May to new customers. With that argument we were able to get them down to 7 May, which is still obscene considering the airports are now operating as normal for new customers. Luckily our employers are being as flexible as possible. I have applied with the Chinese police to have my visa extended which cost \u00a316, but they will take a week to process and keep my passport in that time. The British embassy, before they stopped replying to emails, suggested taking them a letter from the airline as proof I was stranded here. They did offer a signed letter of support, but it has not arrived after four days. Luckily the authorities accepted prints of my old and new e-tickets. We are still trying to contact Finnair to demand new earlier flights back to the UK since airspace has now opened fully, but contacting them is expensive and time-consuming. The worst thing is not knowing where we stand and having little or conflicting information to make decisions based on. We are trying to make serious plans about what to do and need to rely on the laws in place, but some airlines (such as Finnair) are being very clear and open that they will not obey the law.&quot;  If you are having trouble getting a flight home please post a comment or get in touch. My email is matthew.weaver@guardian.co.uk. We will publish more stories and responses as we get them.  12pm BA passengers Karen Bolton and Paul Holtam, from Bridgewater in West Somerset are stranded in the Chinese capital. They also can&apos;t understand why BA are selling still seats, while they are stuck. Karen writes:  &quot;We have been on a tour of China and should have flown home on 18 April from Beijing with BA. Even though airspace has reopened and BA flights have resumed we are having to go to the airport to fight for standby seats to get back. There is only one flight to London per day and the next few days are fully booked so there is little chance of us returning for weeks. I work at Bridgwater College and will have already missed a week of work by tomorrow. BA is continuing to book new passengers on future flights which means stranded passengers cannot return. There are around 200 of us that we know of, including a school group of 40 pupils. I have just checked on the BA website and people can book on flights we are being told are full, at extortionate rates - up to \u00a35,200. It is incredible that BA continue to take bookings on future flights considering the numbers of stranded passengers who should take priority.&quot;   12.30pm: Erica Wald, who is still stranded in Mumbai, doesn&apos;t believe BA&apos;s claim that it is hiking prices to discourage new customers. &quot;It is pure greed. If they were actually interested in getting people back they would freeze all the seats. People are so desperate that they will pay that money to get back. So I don&apos;t believe that is any form of discouragement. As far as I can tell none of the stranded passengers are getting on to the flights.&quot; Here&apos;s a recording of a phone interview with her:   12.54pm: BA have been selling tickets from India to the UK for as much as \u00a32,286 according to this screengrab sent by stranded BA customer Saleem Althaf. &quot;The listing by BA on the website is pure profiteering, plain and simple,&quot; he says. It shows a ticket available on a flight from Bangalore to Heathrow next Tuesday for 155,999 India Rupees or \u00a32,286       1.10pm: &quot;Free the Delhi 12,&quot; says the subject line on another angry email from a BA customer. Elizabeth Atwell writes:   &quot;We are 12 British Airways passengers stranded in Delhi travelling with Voyages Jules Verne. I cannot begin to describe the utter chaos and disorganisation at BA in Delhi. There is not a system or process in place to repatriate passengers. Those stranded earlier do not get priority. It is the luck of the draw. We were due to fly to London on the 19th April but we have now been given return dates between 4th and 10th May. You can only get inside Delhi airport with a valid ticket for the day of travel so it is impossible to re-negotiate your flight unless of course you are willing to pay a backhander to the armed guards on the door.  Hundreds of passengers join the daily waitlist yet only a handful get a seat. With thousands of BA passengers stranded in Delhi it will take weeks to address this without some extra flights. BA says passengers should contact the airline to get earlier dates but that is an impossible task in itself. Unlike other airlines, BA are not re-routing passengers so we appear condemned to another two weeks in Delhi. What is noticeable is that as other airlines are appearing to repatriate passengers successfully it is the BA passengers who are left filling the hotel beds and lobbies. There are thousands of BA passengers stranded in Delhi. I consider it of utmost priority that management from London get to Delhi to sort out the chaos. It is clear that extra flights need to be scheduled to get passengers back to London. Above all, I think it is immoral that BA are selling tickets for their flights over the coming days without repatriating their stranded passengers first. How can BA possibly claim to be the World&apos;s favourite airline?&quot;   1.45pm:  Pedro Gurrola, a senior lecturer in finance, is trying to get a BA flight from Miami to London.  My family and I are stranded in Miami after our flight BA0208 back to London for the 20 April was cancelled. At that time BA offered to rebook on the 3 May, which they assured was the earliest available date.  However, after airspace opened and flights resumed normality, BA began selling seats on earlier flights at very high rates (see below). So for example, if instead of waiting 13 days here, we want to fly before, we will have to pay at least $1,210 for a seat, not to mention the $6,370 (\u00a34,792) for some earlier flights. Of course, the call centre repeats there is no available seat for us before the 3 May, and that we should keep checking with BA to see if an earlier option becomes available in our travel class.       I have asked BA if stranded passenger can pay the high prices and then claim back the expense. A spokeswoman is trying to find out the answer, but she sounded doubtful.  2pm: I&apos;ve put Tom Riley&apos;s complaints about Finnair (see above) to the airline. He said it was &quot;obscene&quot; that airline was offering earlier tickets to new customer while he is still stranded. A spokeswoman said: &quot;I can see his point. But in our system when you have a reservation on a certain flight it looks like you are OK in our system. They should contact customer services as soon as possible.&quot;  &quot;At the moment the lines are very busy and we are sorry about that. All our staff are doing their best. The planes are very full.&quot;  2.22pm: Here&apos;s another furious BA customer. Claire Nisbet bought one of BA&apos;s high price tickets so that her daughter, whose original flights were twice cancelled, can get back for university exams. She has been refused a refund. She emails:  &quot;My daughter&apos;s first flight back from Qatar was cancelled on 15 April, then again on 20 April. It was rebooked for 28 April. Once airports reopened, I spent 24 hours calling BA offices all over the world to try and get someone to answer phone and rebook. But no joy, the UK one gave a spiel then immediately dropped the call saying they were too busy to answer, even at 2.30am.  I first found a one way ticket online at a cost of \u00a32,000. They normally \u00a3400. I later saw one at \u00a3600 for 22 April. I took the risk and bought it to secure, called the Oman office to transfer the booking then turned up at BA office in Qatar to sort it all out. They had received no guidance from UK and were unwilling to reimburse me for the one way ticket, and transfer the seat to the original booking. I still have not had that refund confirmed yet.  I was furious to read on the Guardian today that they had a policy of offering these tickets on the open market while leaving existing customers stuck all over the world, and the nonsense about pricing them out of the market to stop them from selling is not credible when there are a bunch of desperate people stuck all over the world.I have now contacted them and await a reply.&quot;   2.39pm: The plot thickens for Saleem Althaf, stranded in Chennai (see above). He has now been told that he can&apos;t even buy the high-price tickets, even if he could afford them. They have been reserved for new customer, he was told by a BA call centre in Dehli. &quot;The flights showing up on the website are for new passengers only as instructed by the Revenue Management Centre in London. They are not available to existing customers trying to rebook,&quot; these were words exactly Saleem says.  4pm:  I&apos;ve just been speaking with Ian Fisher and Elizabeth Atwell. Two of the Dehli 12 trying to leave the city with BA. Here&apos;s a transcript. Ian, a retired BT engineer, said:  &quot;The atmosphere in the hotel is pretty. People are leaving which give us hope. It&apos;s a better refugee camp than most, but we do feel absolutely confined.  It&apos;s galling to see other airlines getting their people out. We were told that BA is putting on extra flights to Bangkok and Dubai. I would rather have an extra two weeks in Dubai than Dehli. It is by no stretch of the imagination a holiday resort. We were due to be here for one day on the original tour. And that&apos;s about right. It&apos;s a teeming, smelly, very hot city, waiting for the rains to come. And its under the threat of terrorism. It&apos;s currently suffering the worst heat wave for 50 year. It was 42C today. We went down BA&apos;s officer today. We were left for five hours with no refreshment and more importantly no updates. We got there before noon. We were told we would have to wait an hour, then half an hour, but we weren&apos;t seen until about five. We were allowed to go to the toilet but we had to get security people to let us out. We were eventually told they could dig out one seat single. BA chose one individual from our party. The ticket is not for another two days. We are badgering BA every day. Eventually as a sop to make us go away they gave us a fax number for Willie Walsh.&quot;  Elizabeth Atwell, an A Level teacher at a west London comprehensive, said:   &quot;The situation at the airport is really quite serious. People may not be aware but there is very high terror alert in Delhi. At the airport there are armed guards everywhere. It&apos;s impossible to get into the building without a ticket for travel.  &quot;It is really difficult to talk to BA. People are paying backhanders to get into the terminal or its a very long conversation with a tour rep and then someone from BA comes over. And then you join a very long line and hope you are maybe one of the lucky people who is able to board the plane.  The last time we were at the airport there were 65 people and only two people were allowed on the plane. They were only allowed on because they were deemed emergency medical cases. Those 65 people were only the ones who had got through the airport doors. They are not the thousands outside waiting to leave Dehli.  We have been taking it in turns to get to the airport. BA are proving very conspicuous by their absence. We have been talking to the High Commissioner. My impression is that he was dismayed by the number of people trying to get out. He did seems concerned by the level of disorganisation by BA.  There seems to be no system in place to repatriate people back to Britain.&quot;   4.15pm: Liz MacNiven emails on behalf or her teenage son who is stuck on a school trip in Hong Kong, trying to prepare for his GCSEs. She writes:   &quot;There are so many of us dealing with the effects still. We don&apos;t want it to be yesterdays news. My son was on an exchange trip to Hong Kong when the volcano went up. He was due back on 17 April. He and a group of 16 teenagers are stuck there with two teachers until 4 May - -as there are not enough seats available until then.  The host school (Island School Hong Kong) have been amazing, taking the kids in and giving them personal timetables and so on.  The school here in the UK have also done everything they can, sending out work and so on. The two members of staff out there will need several medals for coping with it all when they get back. Also I have to say, I think Virgin Atlantic should be given all praise for doing their best to sort out repatriation flights. But they only have a certain number of planes. The other airlines don&apos;t seem to be doing this. Shame on them. But please don&apos;t let people forget. Just because the air space is open it&apos;s not over for so many of us. My son went away for a week and by the time he finally gets home it will have been more like a month. Goodness only knows what the effect on his GCSE&apos;s will be.&quot;   4.24pm: The Dehli 12 have grown to 24. They have copied me in on a fax they sent to BA&apos;s chief executive Willie Walsh, pleading for help. They reckon this blog has already helped two of the group to get tickets home.  Dear Mr. Walsh, We are writing to you as 24 stranded BA passengers in Delhi. We have just returned from a second fruitless expedition to your corporate offices and after three hours of waiting yesterday and six hours today, have only been allocated one seat on the 25th April flight. The remaining group members have been re-booked on flights departing on the 3rd 6th, 8th 9th and 10th May. We have sent various group members to the airport who have experienced long frustrating waits at check in stand by queues to no avail. We have yet to receive any customer service from BA and understand that you are the only airline currently operating without a priority wait-list for delayed/stranded passengers.  Furthermore, some group members are struggling financially and will be unable to pay the necessary hotel bills if we are required to stay until May.  During our six hour wait at your Delhi office today we were offered no refreshment, neither given any progress reports. To date we have received a shocking lack of support from BA, have been unable to get through to your call centres and are surprised that on line booking still appears to be offering tickets for sale. Almost any destination would be deemed an infinitely preferable place to be stranded rather than Delhi, with its current 41 degrees and official warnings of terrorist activity. We are a captive audience at the hotel. Following a Guardian Newspaper blog two of our party were miraculously found seats on the BA 256 this morning.  It is untenable to leave us stranded in Delhi for three weeks , whilst other passengers continue to fly to schedule. We hope that you will follow the example of other airlines by prioritizing the passengers stranded for the longest period of time and by providing larger and additional aircraft with immediate effect. Please help us. We are counting on your personal intervention to get us home as quickly as possible. Yours sincerely BA Passengers as listed (Names have been removed)   4.45pm: Keith Taylor emails with an interesting story from the perspective of someone not protected by those European regulations that the airlines resent so much.  &quot;Compared to many others we&apos;ve been extremely lucky in that my sister and I are stranded in New York but can afford a hotel room, and we have been rebooked on a flight home to Manchester on 25 April. Unfortunately for us we&apos;re flying with Continental, an American carrier, so we&apos;re not protected by the EU directive that will compel European airlines to reimburse travellers for the cost of accommodation. We&apos;re now about to move into our fourth hotel since our flight was cancelled on 19 April, and by the time we fly our bill will have come to around $1,600 - plus the cost of meals.  We called Continental on the 20 Arpril to rebook our flights and, after several hours of trying, finally got through to an unhelpful and disinterested woman on the reservations line. She offered us a flight home on 3 May, but when I pointed out that there were available tickets on a flight departing on 23 April she faltered, put me on hold for a minute and returned to insist that I must be mistaken. I read out the details from the Continental booking form but she continued to insist the flight didn&apos;t exist. I fluffed the story a little, claiming that we were down to our last few dollars and that we couldn&apos;t afford a hotel beyond the coming night, and at that she thawed a little and searched nearby airports for connections to Manchester. She finally found a flight into Paris Charles de Gaulle connecting to Manchester this coming Sunday, so at least we know we&apos;ll eventually get home. What gets me riled is that repatriating the stranded clearly isn&apos;t a priority for Continental, a fact that becomes more annoying every time I slump to the hotel front desk to hand over another wad of dollars I won&apos;t be seeing again.  Usually in a situation like this the disaffected passenger would grumble for a few moments before concluding with the age old &apos;Next time I&apos;ll fly with BA&apos;, but looking at the stories of BA passengers that doesn&apos;t seem appropriate this time.&quot;   (That&apos;s it from me today.

The leader of the red-shirt protesters, Veera Musikapong, proffered the olive branch if the government agreed to dissolve parliament in 30 days, with elections to be held in three months. &quot;If the government accepts and is open to the talks, we are ready to disperse to restore peace in the country. But the government has to stop threatening people and show responsibility for what has happened,&quot; Veera said. The offer to the government is understood to be an implicit demand that the red-shirt protest sites are not attacked during negotiations, and that a full, independent inquiry is held into the violence that has left dozens of civilians dead. Previously, the red shirts demanded immediate dissolution of parliament, and for the prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, to leave the country. Abhisit had offered to hold elections by the end of the year but the offer was rejected. A government spokesman, Panitan Wattanayagorn, told reporters the prime minister had received the offer. He said: &quot;The prime minister attended a meeting on the matter \u2026 the government has always been open to talks.&quot; Twenty-six people have died in clashes on Bangkok&apos;s streets, 25 of those on 10 April when troops opened fire on protestors in pitched battles across the city. One woman died on Thursday night when five grenades, allegedly fired from within the red shirts&apos; barricaded compound, hit the city&apos;s financial district, including a railway station where a commuter-packed train stood. Eighty-six people were injured. Before the last-minute offer to resume talks, Bangkok appeared to be heading for further bloodshed. The red shirts, resolute behind forts built of bamboo spears and tyres, said they would not leave until the government stepped down. The protesters, mainly the rural poor from Thailand&apos;s north, argue the Abhisit government is illegitimate and a puppet of the Bangkok elite and the military. But the army warned the protesters that their time was running out before they were forcibly removed. An army spokesman, Sunsern Kaewkumnerd, told them: &quot;We don&apos;t want you to risk your lives. If there is a clash you could be hurt by stray bullets. Your time is running out. Please leave the area.&quot; However, there has been speculation that the army is reluctant to move against the protesters again after a failed attempt to clear them from the streets a week ago. The army chief, Anupong Paochinda, has said an election is the only solution to Thailand&apos;s political crisis. Many soldiers, particularly in the lower ranks, are openly supportive of the red shirts&apos; cause. Protesters have nicknamed them &quot;watermelon soldiers&quot;, for their green uniforms on the outside and red sympathies within. But thousands of troops, armed with machine guns, and riot police are still on the streets of the Thai capital, and several countries, including Britain and the US, have warned their citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to Bangkok. For the last three nights, the violence was concentrated on a single intersection at the head of Silom Road. Government supporters wearing yellow shirts have held counter-protests against the reds, hurling bottles and rocks, while pushing over barricades and scuffling with police.

I called Expedia and was told the easiest and cheapest way to do this would be to cancel the whole trip and rebook. I was informed that the airline would charge \u00a3100 for the cancellation and I would get the rest of the money back in seven to 10 days.  However, when I got the refund, \u00a3309 had been deducted. When I complained, I was initially told that it was due to a hotel cancellation. Then I was told it was down to the airline. Then I was told that it was due to the insurance being non-refundable.  All I wanted to do was change my flights, and I ended up losing \u00a3309.

Set in the 1960s, creator Matthew Weiner&apos;s show draws heavily from real products and events of the decade, making his characters either slightly ahead or behind the times; the only person who seems truly plugged into the &quot;now&quot; is central figure Don Draper (Jon Hamm), the agency&apos;s creative director, who, as the show progresses, is revealed to be as much of a construct as anything in the ad world; he&apos;s the very definition of a self-made man. But it&apos;s such a great ensemble piece \u2013 the push-and-pull friction between colleagues is what makes them so good at their jobs and so useless in their personal lives \u2013 that the show becomes about whichever captivatingly flawed character happens to be onscreen. Available either as individual seasons or as a limited-edition set of all three seasons to date, the discs are pleasingly rich with extras. And while it may not seem like a title that would benefit from HD, the Blu-ray of Mad Men only adds to the experience. On regular DVD and TV the image is still soft enough to look perfect. But with extra definition, any blemishes leap out, a reminder that this facade of perfection really is just that: a facade.

But the general scene in the departure hall today was grim. Dozens of British passengers, still stranded by the volcanic ash which snarled international air traffic for six days, queued for hours in steaming heat in pursuit of scarce seats back to the UK. Not for the first time, they came away empty-handed with nothing more to look forward to than another night on the terminal floor or a trek back to the hotel and hours on hold with an airline reservations centre. After a week in which air traffic in Britain and Europe returned to close to normal, long-haul travellers from Mumbai, Dubai, Miami and beyond found themselves left behind, frustrated at becoming the forgotten victims of the Icelandic eruption. &quot;The situation at the airport is really quite serious,&quot; said Elizabeth Atwell from west London, who is with a group of 12 trying to get home from Delhi with British Airways. &quot;There is a very high terror alert and there are armed guards everywhere at the airport. It&apos;s impossible to get into the building without a ticket for travel. &quot;It is really difficult to talk to BA. People are paying backhanders to get into the terminal. The last time we were at the airport there were 65 people [in line for seats] and only two people were allowed on the plane because they were deemed emergency medical cases. There are thousands more outside waiting to leave.&quot; Ian Fisher, a retired BT engineer, said his party of 24 tourists at the same airport spent five hours trying to arrange seats with a BA official today and secured only one. &quot;We were due to be here for one day on the original tour and that&apos;s about right,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s a teeming, smelly, very hot city, waiting for the rains to come. It is currently suffering the worst heatwave for 50\u00a0years. It was 42C today.&quot; BA in particular seemed to be attracting anger after it emerged that the airline is not giving priority to stranded customers and has placed spare seats on the open market. Marooned passengers can take seats at no extra charge, but the problem seems to be in getting hold of them \u2013 with phonelines jammed for hours, website access patchy and staff providing conflicting information. Atwell is so angry that she faxed Willie Walsh, BA&apos;s chief executive, complaining: &quot;There is utter chaos and disorganisation at BA in Delhi.&quot; The airline insists it is doing everything it can. &quot;We understand how frustrated our stranded customers feel,&quot; a spokesman said, adding that extra flights will bring passengers home from Delhi, New York, Hong Kong, the Maldives and Bangkok this weekend. In Chennai, Dr Saleem Althaf, an accident and emergency doctor from Lincolnshire, said he had originally been told by BA that the earliest he could fly was on 10\u00a0May, even though his original flight home was due to leave three days ago. He said it was impossible to book other seats on the company&apos;s website. &quot;I tried BA&apos;s Indian phoneline and gave up in disgust after waiting an hour,&quot; he said. &quot;I am a senior accident and emergency doctor and let&apos;s face it, that is not a speciality where there are people waiting to cover, so the sooner I get back the better.&quot; He explored buying a ticket on open sale for an earlier date and was told by an airline official in India that the seats were &quot;for new passengers only, as instructed by the revenue management centre in London. They are not available to existing customers trying to rebook.&quot; A BA spokesman said this was wrong \u2013 tickets were available and Althaf shouldn&apos;t have to pay. Karen Bolton, a tourist from Bridgwater in Somerset stuck in Beijing, said it was &quot;unbelievable that BA is continuing to take bookings on future flights&quot;. She added: &quot;We have people whose medication is running out and my partner is expecting an operation when he returns.

Is she busy this weekend? Though the hateful plane traffic is back, there remains a pressing need for a poem, preferably on the epic scale, recognising nature&apos;s achievement of something else we had come to believe was impossible: the silencing of Michael O&apos;Leary. Even now, in parks and gardens all over the country, the only sound is the cheering and hosannas of Ryanair survivors, including those previously too traumatised to speak. Have not the days following O&apos;Leary&apos;s reluctant capitulation to European law recalled a more innocent time, when travellers still enjoyed the right to free tap water, or indeed to be pushed along in a wheelchair without paying for the inconvenience this causes to Ryanair operatives who are thereby forced to break off from fining and insulting able-bodied passengers? This, surely, is life as Shakespeare must have known it. On the other hand, as the airport expert and philosopher Alain de Botton argued, in a week that, you might think, comprehensively disproved the claim that it is better to travel than to arrive, suffering is largely the point. &quot;We come from a tradition of pilgrimage,&quot; he told Newsnight, &quot;and pilgrimage is a way of travelling where you try to make it difficult for yourself because you feel there&apos;s a benefit.&quot; Happily, the Pope will be here soon, to commence Mr O&apos;Leary&apos;s long journey towards canonisation. Meanwhile, from the same perspective, the lack of aeroplane seats is still doing numberless holidaymakers a tremendous spiritual favour. Yet another of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull&apos;s silver linings, at least from the government&apos;s point of view, was its arrival at a time when so many potential troublemakers were already held captive in this country, most commentariat leave having been cancelled for the election. Given the fuss of which alpha male talent is capable, when delayed in a congested Stansted airport, or denied its favourite pair of underpants, it is hard even to conceive of Gordon Brown&apos;s difficulties had prominent broadcasters been simultaneously stranded (as volcano-relief parlance has it), in Easter holiday hellholes such as Venice, Bali and Marrakech. There was relief, too, at the BBC, where Jana Bennett was discovered to be still in the country. Still abroad, however, were enough stranded travellers from all parts of the media to tweet, blog or file answers to the big question, posed by one: &quot;How fast can heaven become hell?&quot; In New York \u2013 useful packing tip, this, for anyone planning a trip \u2013 Chris Moyles soon ran out of deodorant. In Milan, Kevin Marsh, head of the BBC&apos;s journalism college, looked on the bright side: &quot;The one thing I have is resource.&quot; In Oman, hotel guests were reduced to rinsing their own underwear, and even, driven by the human instinct for survival, to scavenge illicit rolls from the breakfast buffet. In the circumstances, it is a miracle that Stanley Johnson got home without being eaten. As we know, since the BBC celebrated his historic return with a re-enactment of Chay Blyth&apos;s entry into Portsmouth, Mr Johnson had been busily threatening wildlife in the Gal\u00e1pagos islands when the volcano, perhaps in revenge, threatened resumption of his duties as Boris&apos;s father. Returning home, via Madrid and, in the absence of flights, a ferry from Santander, he was one of several hundred Britons whose arrival at the port coincided with that of an amphibious landing ship, HMS Albion, there to pick up troops trying to come home from Afghanistan. Cognisant of the alternative \u2013 a full fare from Santander \u2013 Mr Johnson hailed his rescue as a &quot;mini-Dunkirk&quot;. &quot;If the volcano had made life difficult for people like my wife and me,&quot; he wrote, &quot;spare a thought for our soldiers in Afghanistan.&quot; His was not the first major challenge to public compassion. The failure of fellow Dunkirk expert Dan Snow&apos;s mercy mission after he announced it on Twitter had also indicated that expectations of public sympathy might, among some affluent holidaymakers, outstrip what was actually available. Snow Jr said he was &quot;really upset&quot; that his thwarted passengers would have to wait for ferries, due to an inexplicable enthusiasm on France&apos;s part for securing her national borders, even from his emergency inflatables. Were conditions in Calais such as to justify exceptional measures, including the deployment of navy vessels to evacuate multitudes of sturdy tourists, as well as a number of more vulnerable ones? At first, the absurd Brown encouraged the idea. The Mail pointed out that our warships were, after all, just sitting around in the sea, &quot;circling uselessly&quot;. Maybe it would win the approval of that paper if, in the next election debate, Nick Clegg proposed that these relics from a different world order be decommissioned and placed on tourism stand-by, ready to fill with plucky Johnsons the next time holiday heaven turns into hell? There can have been few more compelling demonstrations, in recent years, of the importance of resilience, a terrifically fashionable concept that thinktanks now try to apply to everything from national readiness for emergencies to the ability of poor people to cope with financial difficulties. Insofar as a non-wonk can grasp it, resilience means the ability of a system or person to cope with setbacks. Some progressives think it should be taught in schools. Last week, in a paper about the BNP vote, the Institute for Public Policy Research concluded that the party is least popular in places that are resilient and most popular where people are not resilient. Richmond is resilient. Barnsley isn&apos;t. (Haiti even less so.) The hope is that resilience can be acquired, even though, obviously, not everyone can share Richmond&apos;s advantages of employment, education and health. &quot;People who are employed,&quot; the IPPR has noted, generally &quot;have access to more resources than those who are unemployed&quot;. These resources, such as confidence and wealth, can be drawn on &quot;in a time of shock or crisis&quot;. Among hardier ash-victims, for instance, finances combined with health, ingenuity, family and a sense of empowerment (another resilience indicator) to help when the authorities would not. Kevin Marsh plotted his escape from Milan in a taxi (&quot;I settle on \u20ac750&quot;) and groups of fleeing skiers organised joint escapes. &quot;We have just arrived home after a \u20ac2,000 taxi ride from Courchevel in the French Alps,&quot; was one of many tales of resilience posted on the BBC website. Resourceful, but less affluent young tourists could also deal with adversity, running to the front of queues and tweeting for help. Meanwhile, days after these survivors exhausted the public&apos;s interest in spreading ash, impoverished passengers were still camped out at distant airports where available tickets were going first to travellers with the resilience \u2013 or cash \u2013 to pay. One woman described a most un-Bottonian &quot;dog-eat-dog atmosphere&quot;, among tourists competing for seats at Bangkok airport. Lessons will certainly have to be learned from this.

The BBC has some extraordinary footage from earlier of troops firing at protesters.  10.25am: Red shirt protesters and shown building a make shift barricade in this video, which has just been uploaded to YouTube. It is difficult to verify when the video was shot (it says today) but it gives an idea of the kind of tactics being used by the red shirts.             10.41am: Associated Press has this detailed write-up of the clashes:   Along Vibhavadi-Rangsit road, riot squads fired into the air to push protesters back but several tried to remove the razor wire, prompting troops to level their rifles and shoot directly at protesters who fled into oncoming traffic. Police huddled behind riot shields, while soldiers wielding rifles took up positions behind concrete pylons. A heavy afternoon downpour halted the fighting, at least temporarily. The confrontation was chaotic and at one point security forces fired on a group of troops riding toward them on motorbikes in what appeared to be an accident, although some members of the security forces have been accused of siding with the protesters. At least four motorbikes crashed and one soldier was carried away on a stretcher, bleeding profusely from the head. Several others from the group threw their hands in the air. At least 10 protesters wounded in the clash were treated for minor injuries at the nearby Bhumibol Adulyadej Hospital, the hospital said. Army spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd said that troops were told to use rubber bullets but had authority to use live ammunition for self-defence. &quot;At this point, there is too much chaos for anybody to constantly report what kind bullets they are using,&quot; he said. &quot;We brought force out to stop them. At this point, society finds it unacceptable to have protesters traveling in a motorcade like this,&quot; Sansern said. &quot;We try our best to prevent losses.&quot;        10.44am: Alex Crawford of Sky News tweets this from Bangkok: Red shirts at rangsit road disperse Red shirts protestor he saw soldier firing inside a car hitting passenger in head.  11.35am: The soldier who is feared to have died in today&apos;s clashes, appeared to have been shot by in friendly fire incident, according to the BBC. The Thai media claimed he was shot by sniper fire, according to a sceptical tweet from travel writer @andrewspooner.  12.13pm: How loyal are the army to the government? Dissent is beginning to emerge according to a new post on New Mandala, a blog on Thai politics put together by academics from the Australian National University. Senior figures in the army are angry with the Queen for siding with the People Alliance for Democracy, a right wing group linked ruling Democrats, the post claims.  While Army commander Gen Anupong Paojinda was insisting on Sunday that the Royal Thai Army remained solidly united &quot;behind the nation, the people and His Majesty,&quot; many senior and junior officers were cynically asking themselves whether their leader was just trying to convince himself of this unity in front of the public.   12.26pm: The death of the Thai soldier has now been confirmed, but there is still no official word on how he died. AP has this:   A soldier has died and 18 other people have been wounded during a clash between government forces and protesters in Thailand. It is the 27th fatality in recent political violence that has divided the country. Witnesses said the soldier appeared to have been shot by other security forces during a chaotic confrontation.   12.31pm: The Thai prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, tells the BBC he &quot;willing to compromise&quot; with the red shirt protesters. Asked if he would resign if it would help Thailand&apos;s recovery he said: &quot;Of course, I have never put my interests above the country&apos;s.&quot;  1.20pm: A new video on the Thai website Politics purports to show the moment the soldier was shot while on a motorbike.

A Reuters photographer said the soldier was shot through his helmet as troops and riot police tried to stop a convoy of up to 2,000 red-shirts on pickup trucks and motorcycles who had left central Bangkok in to stage protests outside the capital. The protesters ran into hundreds of troops blocking the major road connecting Bangkok with its northern suburbs. Soldiers fired rubber bullets and then live rounds into the air as about 100 protesters moved ahead of the main convoy, charging the security forces. Some red-shirts threw stones and fired balls from slingshots, witnesses said. The clashes ended when a powerful tropical rainstorm broke in the area, 25\u00a0miles from central Bangkok on Vipawadee-Rangsit road. After the melee, the Thai government confirmed the soldier&apos;s death - apparently from &quot;friendly fire&quot; - and said 18 people were wounded during the clash. Anucha Jeabjan, 44, a protester, who witnessed the fighting between red-shirts and the army, said: &quot;We wanted to show Bangkok we are fighting for democracy. But the soldiers blocked us, then they shot at us.&quot; A nearby red-shirt guard, who declined to be named, said the protesters had been unarmed. &quot;We only had our fists,&quot; he said, adding that armed plain-clothed soldiers had infiltrated the demonstrators. &quot;They shot the soldier dead, not us,&quot; he said, but admitted he had not seen the shooting himself. Despite the clashes many protesters said they did not believe the army would use force to dislodge protesters encamped in central Bangkok, saying that the soldiers have &quot;red hearts&quot; and supported the anti-government demonstrations. The government has repeatedly said it will not tolerate protests beyond the commercial shopping zone where the red-shirts have been entrenched for weeks. Others said they were simply not worried by the threat of further clashes. &quot;Let them come,&quot; said Wichai Ornor, 54, who travels 20km everyday to join the rally. &quot;I&apos;m not scared of anything,&quot; he said with a laugh. At least 26 people have been killed and nearly 1,000 wounded in clashes and the government has warned that its patience was running out. Thailand&apos;s prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, who has broken off negotiations with the protesters occupying parts of central Bangkok, said he hoped to resolve the crisis without resorting to force, but has deployed hundreds of soldiers armed with automatic weapons to guard stations and other major city streets. &quot;We recognise that as every day passes by the people of Thailand suffer, the country suffers, but we want to make sure that there is rule of law,&quot; Abhisit told CNN. &quot;We will try to enforce the law with minimum losses and we will try to find a political resolution, but it takes time, patience and co-operation.&quot; The red-shirts consist largely of poor rural supporters of the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and pro-democracy activists who opposed the military coup that ousted him in 2006 on corruption allegations. The group believes that Abhisit&apos;s government, backed by the urban elite, is illegitimate, having been helped into power by the country&apos;s powerful military. Britain&apos;s Foreign Office has warned citizens to avoid all but essential travel to Thailand because of &quot;increasing tension&quot; in the country and because of a risk &quot;that violence could break out without warning&quot;.

The Thai crisis has wound up into a convoluted knot. The immediate way out has to be a negotiated compromise unless both sides are bent on inflicting more casualties than the 26 dead and hundreds injured so far. But much more will be needed for reconciliation in the longer term. A vertical sociopolitical hierarchy has to become relatively more horizontalised. Resistance will beget more blood and tears but mutual recognition and accommodation can recover Thailand&apos;s footing. On the one hand, the reds&apos; protests were initially spawned by the long shadow of Thaksin Shinawatra, the self-exiled former prime minister who has been convicted on corruption charges. It was precisely two weeks after his assets confiscation that the reds took to the streets. On the other, the reds were bound to come out. The parties and governments they elected have been systematically dissolved and ousted from office over the past three years, while the party they did not vote for has taken over government in a fix by the army. Their provocative encampment in large numbers in Bangkok&apos;s central business district is illegal. It has held Bangkok&apos;s population and Thailand&apos;s economy hostage. The reds apparently have a militant auxiliary whose guerrilla tactics are seen as partly behind the escalating violence. Yet it is because they are so disenfranchised and disillusioned with the established hierarchy and rigged rules of the game that the reds have gone for broke. Unable to subdue the reds and unwilling to dissolve the national assembly as the reds demand, Abhisit has pulled out what he sees as an ace card by alienating the reds from the monarchy and effectively rallying rightwing conservatives to come out against the reds. His government&apos;s repertoire of smear campaigns earlier labelled the reds as uninformed masses, Thaksin&apos;s lackeys, communists, and terrorists. As none stuck, the charge of republicanism out to subvert the throne has raised the stakes to their highest. As his government now operates like a civil-military junta (ie the Centre for the Resolution of Emergency Situations), presided by the top brass with Gestapo-like legal powers for arbitrary summons to interrogate opposing individuals, Abhisit has tugged himself into a royalist corner, rationalised as not just any prime minister but the saviour of the throne. Such rationalisation is self-serving and poses a self-fulfilling danger that must be avoided. The reds have responded with incessant words of loyalty and homage to His Majesty but they are unlikely to yield to the government even if their expressed allegiance transpires in vain. The monarchy is at risk of being compromised ironically because Abhisit has introduced it into the fluid political interplay. Instead of calling off negotiations, the prime minister should forward his counter-proposals. The reds are unreasonable to demand a 30-day period for dissolution and 60 more days for new polls. Abhisit wants to finalise the new budget, and both sides want to oversee the annual army promotions. As he holds power, the onus is on Abhisit to state his terms. He can condition new polls on the oversight of budget allocation and army promotions. If they are so confident of winning the election, the reds should be able to accept these conditions. The timing for new polls would then be between three to six months hence. The prime minister may cry foul and Thailand would see another bad precedent of street protesters overthrowing a sitting government. Yet there have been too many fouls in the current democratic game under the military-inspired constitution. New rules will be needed after new polls. But all that would be a stop-gap measure. Ultimately, Thailand has to find a way to have majority rule with the protection of minority rights. Winning elections must not become a blank cheque for the corruption and abuse of power seen under Thaksin&apos;s tenure. The reds need to address the Thaksin problem. Abhisit and his powerful backers and patrons must be willing to flatten the hierarchy incrementally and up to a point. No society is completely equal. Thailand&apos;s is evidently not egalitarian enough. With mutual recognition of the expectations and reforms needed to move Thailand forward, all protagonists can begin to hammer out and haggle over the nuts and bolts of a new hierarchy that is more horizontal with an acceptable slope to all sides.", "publicationDate": "2010-04-29T12:30:01Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Protest", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/29/compromise-answer-thailand-crisis", "title": "Compromise is the only answer to the Thai crisis | Thitinan Pongsudhirak", "sentences": ["Their provocative encampment in large numbers in Bangkok&apos;s central business district is illegal.", "It has held Bangkok&apos;s population and Thailand&apos;s economy hostage."]}, {"article": "After 54 days of protest and 27 deaths, Thailand&apos;s bloody political standoff appeared almost at an end today, with the redshirt protesters agreeing to a government offer of an election this year. The redshirt leadership agreed to a proposal from embattled Thai prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva for a &quot;reconciliation road map&quot; that included the dissolution of parliament before a general election on 14 November. The redshirts have been on the streets of the Thai capital since 12 March, calling for the resignation of the Abhisit government, which they regard as illegitimate, and in power on the back of the military. Today, on the stage at their main protest site in the heart of Bangkok&apos;s shopping district, leader Veera Musikapong announced: &quot;Redshirt leaders unanimously agree to join, and welcome, the reconciliation roadmap proposed by the prime minister to prevent further loss of life.&quot; The prime minister made his offer on every channel on Thai TV yesterday evening, telling the nation: &quot;I am confident we can bring back peace.&quot; But the redshirts will not leave the streets of Bangkok yet, asking that the government clarify the details of its offer. Veera argued the election date was the bailiwick of the electoral commission, not the prime minister, and asked Abhisit to nominate a date when he would dissolve parliament. Other key details are still to be thrashed out, including the caveats imposed by Abhisit, such as insisting that an election only be held &quot;once the country is peaceful&quot;, and other vague but potentially draconian conditions, including that &quot;the government will ensure that the media will function as a constructive tool&quot;. There is widespread desire in the capital for the redshirts&apos; protest to end as soon as possible. Tomorrow is coronation day in Thailand, and were the redshirts to mark it by pulling down their tyre-and-bamboo barricades blocking Bangkok&apos;s streets it would be seen an act of good faith and of loyalty to the monarchy. While the early election \u2013 Abhisit&apos;s term does not expire until the end of 2011 \u2013 will widely be seen as a victory for the redshirts, the timing of an election at the end of the year is a concession won by the government. Both sides of Thailand&apos;s political divide want to be in power in September, for two critical events: the annual round of promotions in the military \u2013 a highly political body in Thailand \u2013 and the passing of the country&apos;s budget. Both are taking credit for the breakthrough, but the passage of time has also played a part in ending the standoff. As the sit-in has dragged on, the number of redshirt protesters behind the heavily fortified barricades has dwindled. From a peak of perhaps 100,000, there now remains a hardcore of a few thousand. Most redshirts are rural Thais from the poorer north and north-east of the country, and many have had to return home for the rice-planting season. Others have been frightened away by government threats that troops would again use force to move them, after 25 people died when troops moved on protesters on 10 April. An election is widely tipped to be won by the redshirt-aligned Puea Thai party, a successor of exiled former fugitive PM Thaksin Shinawatra&apos;s Thai Rak Thai party. But even a &quot;free and fair&quot; election is not guaranteed to bring peace and stability. Professor of south-east Asian politics at the University of Leeds, Duncan McCargo, warned that should a redshirt-aligned government take power, the Abhisit-loyal, pro-monarchy yellowshirt supporters could be inspired on to the streets. &quot;Then, we&apos;re back to where we were because 30 to 40% of the population can&apos;t accept either result.

Suthep Thaugsuban will hear complaints against him at the justice ministry&apos;s department of special investigations, and the redshirt protesters say they will not abandon their fortified protest site in the heart of Bangkok&apos;s shopping and finance district until police bring criminal charges against him over the 10 April violence. As the political crisis gripping Bangkok dragged into its ninth week, the protesters said they would agree to the government&apos;s proposed timetable to dissolve the parliament in late September, before an election on 14 November. But they imposed new conditions on the government&apos;s &quot;roadmap for reconciliation&quot;, including the restoration of their television channel, and criminal charges against Suthep. &quot;Once Suthep turns himself in to the police, the [protesters] will disperse and return home,&quot; the co-leader of the redshirts, Nattawut Saikua, told supporters. In response, a government spokesman, Panitan Wattanayagorn, told reporters: &quot;Deputy prime minister Suthep will go to the department of special investigations to hear the accusations against him.&quot; The spokesman said no charges had been laid against Suthep, and stressed that he was not giving in to redshirt demands to &quot;surrender&quot; to police. Family members of those killed have lodged complaints with the ministry of justice, calling for charges to be laid against Suthep, who gave the order on 10 April for troops to move in on protesters. The move quickly descended into violence. Protesters hurled rocks, concrete and grenades at troops, who responded initially by firing rubber bullets, but later aimed live rounds into the crowd. Twenty-five people, including five soldiers and a Japanese cameraman, were killed and more than 800 injured. But the operation failed to move the protesters on, and chunks of Bangkok have been in redshirt hands ever since. Suthep was replaced as head of the Thai government&apos;s centre for the resolution of the emergency situation days later. Sporadic outbreaks of violence have continued since, with another four people killed in separate grenade and gun attacks. But it appears unlikely there will be further violence on the streets of Bangkok, with army commanders saying openly they will not send troops back in against protesters, and the warring parties inching towards a peaceful resolution. More than 60 days of protests have seen a metamorphosis in the redshirts, formally known as the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD). Once a protest group largely made up of the rural poor committed to the public restoration of the disgraced former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the movement is now a broad-based, if factionalised and undisciplined, movement for grassroots democratic change. It argues that the current government has no mandate, having come to power in a parliamentary election it claims was engineered by the military. &quot;It has become much more than just Thaksin now; the UDD have shown themselves to be a force to be reckoned with,&quot; said Chulalongkorn University political science professor Thitinan Pongsudhirak. &quot;They are a force for change and they will not go away quietly.&quot; Thaksin&apos;s face still features heavily on the group&apos;s merchandise, and his billions are still financing the protests, but his significance for the movement has waned. He now rarely addresses the protests by phone, and the red shirt leadership has made no demands about Thaksin at any stage during its long-running standoff with the government. There are concerns, however, that no long-term political peace will be achieved, even with an election, which would probably be won by the red shirt-aligned Puea Thai party. &quot;The election campaign \u2026 could be very nasty,&quot; said Thitinan. &quot;It could actually exacerbate the confrontation. It could end up in the same vicious cycle: whoever wins, the losers won&apos;t accept it.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-05-10T17:31:57Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/10/thailand-protests-deputy-prime-minister", "title": "Thai protesters demand criminal charges against deputy PM", "sentences": ["Suthep Thaugsuban will hear complaints against him at the justice ministry&apos;s department of special investigations, and the redshirt protesters say they will not abandon their fortified protest site in the heart of Bangkok&apos;s shopping and finance district until police bring criminal charges against him over the 10 April violence.", "As the political crisis gripping Bangkok dragged into its ninth week, the protesters said they would agree to the government&apos;s proposed timetable to dissolve the parliament in late September, before an election on 14 November.", "But the operation failed to move the protesters on, and chunks of Bangkok have been in redshirt hands ever since.", "But it appears unlikely there will be further violence on the streets of Bangkok, with army commanders saying openly they will not send troops back in against protesters, and the warring parties inching towards a peaceful resolution."]}, {"article": " 10.08am:  Thai troops are advancing towards a redshirt checkpoint as they bid to clear Bangkok&apos;s streets of up to 10,000 protesters.

In most places, the reds&apos; camp and the troop position are a couple of hundred metres apart. The areas between, some of the most exclusive addresses in Bangkok, are almost deserted. Shops have been closed and thousands of residents who live in central city apartments have fled. Gunfire rings out on-and-off, mixed with the explosions of firecrackers and grenades being launched. Police helicopters fly overhead. As the troops try to move in on the redshirts&apos; encampment, more protesters, not necessarily redshirts but sympathetic to their cause and resentful of the government crackdown, are coming out onto the streets, attacking the soldiers from behind. They are throwing bricks, molotov cocktails and lumps of concrete. Most of Bangkok&apos;s busiest roads, which would usually by jammed with traffic on a Friday afternoon, are deserted save for protestors and soldiers. Protesters are burning tyres, and, in some cases, seized army vehicles in the streets.&quot;   10.51am:       Nick Kenchington writes:&quot;The forums aren&apos;t half bad [on Ajarn Forum].

I don&apos;t have any way of confirming this beyond what I remember from the scene but it felt like it grazed my head.&apos; [...] Fuller said he was just inside the barricades when he was interviewing Seh Daeng. The opposition figure was facing out of the barricades and into Bangkok&apos;s business district of tall office buildings. &apos;He was standing in the same location for a while when I was talking to him but he was moving around, he was gesticulating,&apos; Fuller said. &apos;He wasn&apos;t standing still, he was bobbing his head.&apos; Seh Daeng did not appear to be armed or have bodyguards, but was dressed in camouflage jacket and a floppy hat, Fuller said.

AP has been told Maj Gen Khattiya Sawasdiphol, better known as Seh Daeng, is in a coma Friday and that he could &quot;die at any moment.&quot; Three other people have been killed in the violence since then and 69 wounded, officials have said.  3.30pm:  The Nation, a broadsheet newspaper in Thailand, is now reporting that four people have been killed in the violence. Elsewhere Sondhi Limthongkul, the founder of Thailand&apos;s so-called yellow shirts movement, has reportedly announced his resignation for the leadership of the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy party: Sondhi, who was shot and wounded in an assassination attempt a year ago, resigned on the ASTV television station earlier today.  3.57pm:  Several organisations now reporting that the death toll has risen to five, and the Press Association is suggesting 81 people have been injured. There&apos;s a difficulty in getting accurate reports as so much of central Bangkok is now sealed off, however government spokesman Panitan Wattanayagorn has insisted &quot;policy is not to disperse the protesters&quot;. He said the government&apos;s aim was to set up checkpoints and &quot;tighten&quot; the area around the protest, but &quot;there have been attempts to agitate officers.&quot; In a later speech, Panitan said security forces hadn&apos;t entered the demonstration area but were attacked and forced to protect themselves. He also warned that security efforts would be stepped up in the coming days and &quot;many areas would be under control soon.&quot;  4.24pm:  The Nation is running an &quot;exclusive interview&quot; with Seh Daeng, conducted just before he was shot. This segment, where Seh Daeng talks about how difficult it would be to kill him, is a little haunting, given what happened shortly after this interview.  Q : Why is there now a military presence? A : It happened after the deal was made [to pressure noncooperative leaders]. Some people say the deal was not fully successful because I stood in the way. Some try to find out why it is so difficult to kill me, even though I am unarmed and travel alone. Q : Why can&apos;t they catch you? A : Who would dare to come in here? Would you dare if ordered to catch me? Q : What about when you are outside? A : I don&apos;t go outside. I stay within the protest areas. It&apos;s like a spy movie if you imagine about them infiltrating among red shirts and taking me.  The Bangkok Post is now reporting Seh Daeng&apos;s chances of survival are &quot;low&quot;. Dr Chaiwan told the newspaper the renegade army officer is on life support and still unconscious. &quot;His chance of survival is quite low,&quot; Chaiwan said. He He confirmed that Maj-Gen Khattiya was shot once through the temple, and added that medical teams were monitoring Seh Daeng&apos;s condition minute by minute.  5.05pm:  Right that&apos;s it for today. Death toll figures are varying between five and seven at the moment, but it has been difficult to get these confirmed all day and will probably become more so overnight.

Outside pressure to calm the situation would be immense. Thailand&apos;s latest tumults, which began in March, have failed to attract that level of interest, nor have they been afforded much importance in the wider world. But that may be changing as the country visibly struggles to avoid a descent into uncontrolled violence, even civil war. Despite a long history of military interference \u2013 the army has mounted 18 actual or attempted coups since 1933 \u2013 Thailand remains a democratic country with a parliamentary system and a constitutional monarch. It was the 2006 army coup ousting the elected prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, that initially triggered the present crisis. Thailand&apos;s continuing democratic example matters to Malaysia, to the south, where tensions over ethnic, civil and human rights sometimes produce autocratic responses, and even more so in Burma, to the north, where pro-democracy forces oppose a brutal military dictatorship. But sustaining Thai democracy also matters to Britain and other western countries, which look at a region increasingly influenced by the Chinese communist hegemony and wonder how long key states such as Indonesia, the world&apos;s most populous Muslim country, will uphold western democratic values and standards if neighbours discard them. The political, as well as physical, collision between the redshirts \u2013 a pro-Thaksin movement ostensibly representing the urban and rural poor \u2013 and establishment forces comprising the political and military elites, royalists and Thailand&apos;s newly wealthy bourgeoisie also has a significance reaching beyond Bangkok. The rich versus poor theme can be overplayed. The reality is more complicated. The billionaire Thaksin is no Robin Hood, and his time in power was marked by a violent war on drugs, high-level corruption and harsh military measures in the south. That said, both sides have a responsibility to the mass of Thais who have not shared much, or at all, in the country&apos;s growing prosperity. Thailand&apos;s Eton-educated prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, who, Gordon Brown-like, gained office without first winning an election, lacks the legitimacy an endorsement at the polls would give him. If he cannot end the confrontation without more bloodshed, which he has repeatedly failed to do so far, it seems clear he will have to stand down. Perhaps he should do so, anyway. Wiser heads in Bangkok say that what&apos;s needed is a national dialogue and early elections, for the world already has too many old Etonians exercising power with questionable mandates. A general amnesty, embracing the exiled Thaksin, might facilitate such a process, help end the fighting and get the bloodstained generals off the hook on which the redshirts would hang them. The alternative \u2013 another army takeover \u2013 could potentially tip the country into Burmese-style junta-dom. The impact of the crisis on Thailand&apos;s economy has serious international implications, not least for the British and other European tourists who have lately stopped coming. Growth rates and consumer and investor confidence are all down sharply in what was, until recently, one of world&apos;s few thriving economies. As usual, it will be the poorest in Thai society who will suffer most from any downturn, thereby intensifying the social divide. If rising social inequality, abuse of civil and human rights and the damage being done to democratic institutions by warring elites are not enough to spark increased international engagement, then selfish security considerations might do the trick. Southern Thailand is home to a long-running separatist insurgency involving ethnic Malay Muslims who reject direct rule from Bangkok. There is evidence that al-Qaida-related activists in Indonesia and Malaysia have tried to fan and exploit this conflict in the past. A collapse, or prolonged paralysis, of the central civil authority would be an invitation to further polarising unrest. And the last thing world needs is another battlefront with militant Islam.", "publicationDate": "2010-05-14T13:00:01Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Protest", "Al-Qaida", "Indonesia", "Malaysia", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/14/thailands-unrest-may-unsettle-region", "title": "Thailand's unrest may unsettle region | Simon Tisdall", "sentences": ["If the clashes in Bangkok were transposed to central Paris, international commentators would be talking excitedly about revolution, class warfare, the future of the social contract, looming economic catastrophe and the end of democracy.", "The political, as well as physical, collision between the redshirts \u2013 a pro-Thaksin movement ostensibly representing the urban and rural poor \u2013 and establishment forces comprising the political and military elites, royalists and Thailand&apos;s newly wealthy bourgeoisie also has a significance reaching beyond Bangkok.", "Wiser heads in Bangkok say that what&apos;s needed is a national dialogue and early elections, for the world already has too many old Etonians exercising power with questionable mandates.", "Southern Thailand is home to a long-running separatist insurgency involving ethnic Malay Muslims who reject direct rule from Bangkok."]}, {"article": "     Thai troops opened fire on rioting anti-government protesters today as the government tried to throw a security cordon around the protest site occupied for nearly two months by the redshirts. Bangkok&apos;s commercial district was turned into a battlefield with troops firing teargas, rubber bullets and live rounds at protesters, who returned fire with stones and homemade rockets on roads surrounding the shopping district. At least three people have been shot dead in the city in the last 24 hours, and more than 40 wounded. Reuters reported that a Thai photographer and a foreign journalist had also been shot in yesterday&apos;s skirmishes as demonstrators gathered outside the Suan Lum night market to stop soldiers sealing off roads. A Bangkok-based foreign journalist working for France 24 television station was wounded, the station said, while Reuters said a Thai photographer was also shot. A renegade general who has been in charge of security for the thousands of protesters is in a stable but critical condition today after being shot in the head last night. It remains unclear who was responsible for the shooting. Khattiya Sawasdipol, a suspended army specialist better known as Seh Daeng (Commander Red), underwent brain surgery after being hit, apparently by a sniper, while talking to reporters yesterday evening. The protesters were forced to retreat last night, leaving burning vehicles in their wake as soldiers took control of an intersection leading to a road lined with evacuated hotels and foreign embassies. Troops fired rubber bullets into Lumphini park in central Bangkok after gunshots were heard near the protesters&apos; base, Thailand television said. Although soldiers used teargas and water cannon before dawn at the Nana intersection and tackled skirmishes around the city, the demonstrators remained defiant, vowing to fight on to the death. &quot;They are tightening a noose on us but we will fight to the end, brothers and sisters,&quot; a protest leader, Nattawut Saikua, told a cheering crowd of about 10,000 at the main protest site. Troops have yet to seal all roads leading to the area of luxury hotels and department stores, raising questions as to how soon the government will end the protests. &quot;An operation to seal off the area has just begun. It will take time. We are doing it in a way that does not cause heavy casualties but tightens the protest area,&quot; said a government spokesman, Panitan Wattanayagorn. The shooting of the general sparked half a dozen confrontations overnight between rock-throwing protesters and armed security forces on the outskirts of the protesters&apos; barricaded encampment. One protester was shot in the eye and died after a group of redshirts confronted soldiers armed with assault rifles next to a park in the Silom business district, witnesses said. Some protesters hurled rocks and troops fired in return. This morning, the military brought in armoured vehicles, shut down power in some areas at the protest site and cut some mobile phone services. Khattiya had been branded a terrorist by the Thai government, which accused him of involvement in dozens of grenade attacks that have wounded more than 100 people. In recent days he was critical of other redshirt leaders, accusing them of embracing the offers of &quot;national reconciliation&quot; from the prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, which unravelled after protesters refused to leave the streets. Most businesses and embassies, including the British and US embassies, in the area evacuated staff and closed for the day today. Apartment complexes were mostly empty after the government warned it would shut down power and water supplies, and landlords urged tenants to leave. The crisis \u2013 in which 30 people have been killed since April and more than 1,400 wounded \u2013 has paralysed parts of Bangkok and sparked Thailand&apos;s deadliest political violence in 18 years, decimating tourism and pushing away foreign portfolio investors. The latest violence followed tough security measures imposed last night to reclaim Bangkok&apos;s commercial district after the collapse of the reconciliation plan proposed last week by Abhisit. The prime minister is under pressure to end the protests, which began with festive rallies on 12 March and descended into violence that is stoking concerns over the outlook of south-east Asia&apos;s second-biggest economy. The flare-up in violence sent ripples through financial markets and prompted investors to buy government bonds, considered a safe-haven asset, and sell stocks. The yield on five-year government bonds, which moves inversely to the price, dropped to a nine-month low. Stocks fell 1.2%.", "publicationDate": "2010-05-14T14:12:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Protest", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/14/thai-troops-close-redshirt-protesters", "title": "Three killed as Thai troops fire on redshirts", "sentences": ["Bangkok&apos;s commercial district was turned into a battlefield with troops firing teargas, rubber bullets and live rounds at protesters, who returned fire with stones and homemade rockets on roads surrounding the shopping district.", "A Bangkok-based foreign journalist working for France 24 television station was wounded, the station said, while Reuters said a Thai photographer was also shot.", "Troops fired rubber bullets into Lumphini park in central Bangkok after gunshots were heard near the protesters&apos; base, Thailand television said.", "The crisis \u2013 in which 30 people have been killed since April and more than 1,400 wounded \u2013 has paralysed parts of Bangkok and sparked Thailand&apos;s deadliest political violence in 18 years, decimating tourism and pushing away foreign portfolio investors.", "The latest violence followed tough security measures imposed last night to reclaim Bangkok&apos;s commercial district after the collapse of the reconciliation plan proposed last week by Abhisit."]}, {"article": "     Bangkok is a city at war, with the promise of more bloodshed to come. As pitched battles raged across the capital throughout a sweltering day today and deep into the night, both sides in this conflict \u2013 the Thai government and thousands of red shirt protesters \u2013 warned they would not back down or negotiate. Seven people were killed and more than 100 injured in clashes between troops and protesters, bringing the number killed in the two-month protest to 36. Leaders of the anti-government movement warned that they were prepared, and expected, to spill more blood. &quot;We will continue to rally here,&quot; the reds&apos; leader, Jatuporn Prompan, said. &quot;If the government wants to disperse us, do it tonight and don&apos;t wait till tomorrow. because we&apos;ll fight to the end.&quot; As he spoke, the prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, remained bunkered down in an army barracks safe house in the city&apos;s north, meeting with his cabinet and senior military leaders, but declining invitations to speak publicly. Instead, a spokesman for his administration warned that the government&apos;s efforts to reclaim the capital&apos;s streets would be stepped up in coming days, and that &quot;many areas would be under control soon&quot;. The spokesman defended the use of live rounds by soldiers against protesters, saying troops were authorised to use live ammunition in self-defence. He said: &quot;The soldiers had no choice but to respond to these attacks.&quot; The centre of Bangkok is now a battleground, with rolling skirmishes being fought in the streets by protesters from the red-shirts&apos; compound, fortified with tyres and sharpened bamboo staves, and troops from hastily constructed sand-bagged and razor-wired positions. In most places, the reds&apos; camp and troop positions are only a few hundred metres apart. The areas between, some of the most exclusive addresses in Bangkok, are almost deserted.Shops have been closed and thousands of residents who live in central city apartments have fled. Police helicopters fly overhead constantly. Throughout the day gunfire rang out, sending protesters scurrying into nearby side streets or behind cars. It was mixed with the explosions of fireworks and grenades being launched. As troops and police attempted to move forward on protesters, they threw teargas canisters to facilitate their advance. Their sorties were met with a hail of projectiles, bottles, bricks, lumps of concrete pulled from kerbs and petrol bombs in energy drink bottles. The red shirts have established several lines of defence and have soaked their barricades in petrol, ready to set alight if they are pushed back. Progress for the soldiers has been limited, with protesters still occupying a sprawling compound of some one-and-a-half-square-miles in the centre of Bangkok, which takes in huge parts of the city&apos;s shopping and finance districts. The red shirts want the current government ousted, claiming it illegitimately came to power on the back of a military-engineered parliamentary election after their party was excluded from the poll. This round of anti-government protest has continued since 12 March. The military said this week its tactic was to seal off the red shirts from the outside world and peacefully end the protest. It was intended to be a slow burn, with more than 30,000 troops to surround the reds&apos; camp, cutting off all communications, as well as supplies of food, water and fuel. Electricity and water supplies to the central city have been cut in parts of the protest area and mobile phone signals scrambled. But, so far, the government has failed to isolate the red shirts; supplies are still being ferried in and the protesters have prepared themselves with refrigerated trucks full of food and water, scores of generators and walkie-talkies. They have also urged supporters in the provinces to come to Bangkok to reinforce their standoff. In response, the government has declared a state of emergency for 15 rural provinces in an effort to stop reinforcements travelling to the capital. Earlier this week, the government and red shirts appeared close to agreeing on a &quot;reconciliation road map&quot; that included an election in November. But talks foundered and the plan for peace evaporated into open warfare in the capital The prime minister&apos;s inaction has raised new concerns that he has lost control of his government and the army, as well as the streets of the capital. The leadership vacuum has paralysed decision-making within the government and military and left the government on the brink of collapse, analysts say. &quot;With another day of another futile ultimatum and no fruitful action, PM Abhisit risks losing any credibility he has left,&quot; said a commentator, Nattaya Chetchotiros. &quot;People who have supported him could start turning against him any time.&quot; And while the army remains, in theory, under the control of government, there is a growing sense it may soon abandon the beleaguered Abhisit administration. Army chief Anupong Paochinda has been publicly reluctant about ordering his troops to forcibly remove the red shirts, and on the streets, soldiers have pleaded with protestors to communicate. &quot;We are the people&apos;s army. We are just doing our duty for the nation. Brothers and sisters, let&apos;s talk together,&quot; troops said through a loudspeaker. As well, speculation is mounting that it was an army sniper who shot a renegade army general aligned with the red shirts, in defiance of orders from superiors. It was the shooting on Thursday of the fugitive army major general Seh Daeng, who led the red shirts paramilitary wing, which sparked the latest round of violence. He remains in a coma in hospital. and is not expected to survive. on Thursday night, which shows no sign of abating 36 hours later.", "publicationDate": "2010-05-14T18:01:31Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Protest", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/14/bangkok-clashes-red-shirts-thai-government", "title": "Bangkok torn by clashes as red shirts and Thai government dig in", "sentences": ["     Bangkok is a city at war, with the promise of more bloodshed to come.", "He said: &quot;The soldiers had no choice but to respond to these attacks.&quot; The centre of Bangkok is now a battleground, with rolling skirmishes being fought in the streets by protesters from the red-shirts&apos; compound, fortified with tyres and sharpened bamboo staves, and troops from hastily constructed sand-bagged and razor-wired positions.", "The areas between, some of the most exclusive addresses in Bangkok, are almost deserted.Shops have been closed and thousands of residents who live in central city apartments have fled.", "Progress for the soldiers has been limited, with protesters still occupying a sprawling compound of some one-and-a-half-square-miles in the centre of Bangkok, which takes in huge parts of the city&apos;s shopping and finance districts.", "They have also urged supporters in the provinces to come to Bangkok to reinforce their standoff."]}, {"article": "Paradise Found, London A much-deserved coup for the Menier Chocolate Factory this week.

Nigel Harman (so excellent in the recent West End revival of Three Days Of Rain) and John Light will be alternating the roles of brothers Austin and Lee, even on occasion tossing a coin to see who plays which role. One of the brothers is a budding Hollywood scriptwriter on the verge of his first big break, the other a petty criminal with a vivid imagination whose mythic tales start to appeal to a Hollywood producer who is considering Austin&apos;s script.

The probing depths of psychiatry have often proved to be a fruitful topic for drama: think of Equus, the recently revived Mrs Klein, and even Terry Johnson&apos;s crazy Hysteria, among others. With Shrunk, her second play, former theatre publicist Charlotte Eilenberg focuses on the couch in a two-hander that finds successful psychoanalyst Max feeling rather pleased with himself, until the arrival of new patient Celia. As is often the way, things don&apos;t quite go as Max expects in this play exploring therapeutic accountability and responsibility. Eilenberg&apos;s debut, The Lucky Ones, won the Olivier and Critics&apos; Circle most promising playwright awards after it was staged at Hampstead Theatre in 2003.

In the 90s he transformed from a geeky, twitchy presence in soft dramas like Moonstruck and Peggy Sue Got Married into the oddest action hero of all time. Unlike Stallone and Schwarzenegger, Cage was a true livewire, a psychotic, tender presence who could kick ass even while being a doting father; who could forget him brawling to the death for the sake of his son&apos;s soft toy in 1997&apos;s Con Air (&quot;Put the bunny back in the box!&quot;). Cage was something mainstream moviegoers and indie mavens could agree on, a soldier for hire who could be put to service by David Lynch in one of his dark, individualist fantasies or drafted in by Jerry Bruckheimer to serve time in a tour of blockbuster duty. After his Academy award nomination for Adaptation in 2002, however, the once-meaty action roles had begun to reek of ham. He made poor dramatic choices \u2013 Lord Of War, The Weather Man and the ghastly Wicker Man \u2013 and even his fans began to see the funny side. Websites such as niccageaseveryone.blogspot.com reimagined him as everyone from Batgirl to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, while his gaudy taste in knick-knacks became as pilloried as Michael Jackson&apos;s, the latest being a nine-foot pyramid tomb. In October last year things turned uglier, with the death of his father, to whom he was close. This came at the height of Cage&apos;s public problem with the IRS, which itself resulted in a feud with his financial advisor, who, in response to a lawsuit from Cage, painted his ex-client as a wastrel who frittered all his A-list cash on haunted houses and dinosaur bones. He has been known to cancel interviews on a whim and his media silence around the release of Kick-Ass, the film that redelivered the old Cage to the audience that grew up with him (in the likes of Con Air and Face/Off), suggested that maybe he was backing away from public life. But then, Cage has never been one to conform to expectations. This, after all, is the actor who switched on the Christmas lights in his newly adopted hometown of Bath (&quot;I&apos;m feeling kind of ELECTRIC right now!&quot; he roared), and anyone who doubts that Cage can still cut it should pay a visit to Werner Herzog&apos;s Bad Lieutenant, in which he not only raises the bar for extreme, envelope-pushing acting, he nukes it. When we catch up with him Cage, now 46, is in good spirits. In Herzog, 67, he has found the perfect collaborator, a Bavarian soulmate and a great respecter of the berserk, the ideal director for this tale of squalor and redemption in which Cage, as gambling, drug-addled cop Terence McDonagh, battles a spinal injury, gangs and his beautiful, high-class hooker-girlfriend&apos;s vermin clients while trying to solve a murder in post-Katrina New Orleans. Until his 90s switch into documentaries, Herzog was known for his arthouse collaborations with his barking-mad star, the late, much-missed Klaus Kinski, and Cage openly admits that part of the attraction was trying to emulate that creative chemistry.     Nic Cage and Eva Mendes in Bad Lieutenant.     &quot;I very much wanted to work with Werner,&quot; he drawls. &quot;I wanted to have ...&quot; He corrects himself. &quot;Well, I wanted to see if I could have that relationship, in a positive way as opposed to a negative way, that Werner had with Kinski.&quot; The two first met at his uncle Francis [Ford Coppola]&apos;s house, when Cage was eight and more interested in the director&apos;s tattoo of a skull wearing a top hat. Later, back in the early-90s, there was a chance that they&apos;d work together on a movie about Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, the Spanish dictator-explorer who brought mayhem and murder to South America. &quot;But I was living in Los Angeles at the time,&quot; says Cage, &quot;and I just didn&apos;t wanna play Cort\u00e9s, because I grew up around that area, y&apos;know, which has a lot of Mexican, uh, folks there.&quot; He laughs. &quot;I didn&apos;t want to be the face of Cort\u00e9s in LA.&quot; But when they did finally work together, the results were dynamic. And just as Herzog&apos;s work with Kinski became clouded with myth, rumour and counter-rumour, so has his one and only film with Cage. Herzog, for example, as well as claiming that the movie is about &quot;the bliss of evil&quot;, has said this: &quot;On the second day of shooting [Cage] asked me, &apos;Why is he so bad? Is it the drugs? Is it the destruction of the city? Is it the corruptness of the police?&apos;&quot; The actor wishes to differ. &quot;I remember him saying the movie was about the bliss of evil,&quot; he says warily, &quot;but I don&apos;t remember me questioning him: why is this guy so bad? That&apos;s not something I&apos;d say. Although I must say that Werner&apos;s point of view on the bliss of evil is what makes the film work. Because it&apos;s so delicious for audiences to enjoy vicariously this cop doing all the things that we know we shouldn&apos;t do. And the presentation that Werner \u2013 particularly as encapsulated by those three words, &apos;bliss of evil&apos; \u2013 is what gives the movie its marvellous tone. &quot;Now,&quot; he continues, &quot;I was going at it from another perspective. I was having fun with it; I was laughing on my way home from work sometimes but I also felt ... that I also wanted to show the ugliness of the drugs, and that I didn&apos;t want to glamorise it. I wanted Terence to be kinda hard to watch at times, and my face would get screwed up at time from the grimaces from the coke and from the ... the ... whatever else he was putting in his body, and the exhaustion from lack of sleep. So it was important for me that he became almost grotesque, like a modern but degenerated Richard III of New Orleans, the twist in his back, was just trying to call up a little bit of Richard III.&quot; And just as he fearlessly addressed alcoholism with his Oscar-winning turn in Leaving Las Vegas, so Cage dove headlong into the murky mindset of a man on coke, crack and smack. &quot;That was really difficult,&quot; he says. &quot;I mean, I didn&apos;t know that I could do it, so it was a huge challenge for me. Uh, I ... I ...&quot; Untypically, he starts to reach for the words. &quot;I guess I thought of it as an impressionistic point of view, like a recall. Of whatever may have happened in my past from 25 years ago, where maybe I had, like, a lost weekend, and then I tried to recall that. But that was pretty distant, and a very faint memory. So I decided to meet with different drug counsellors and addicts and just ask them questions about behaviour. So then I carefully graphed out where the more speed-like substances, like coke, would give Terence that feeling of invincibility, and that fast talking, and those sort of lip-smacking sounds, and tics, and swallowing, with the dry mouth. And then when the heroin, or the downer drugs, came into the body, the speech became slower, and the blinking became slower.&quot; Cage plays down Herzog&apos;s claims that his improvising terrified the cast, notably two old ladies who were threatened with a .44 Magnum and treated to the C-word in an improvised scene that takes an already insane film to crazy new heights. &quot;They&apos;re actresses,&quot; he demurs, &quot;so they like to play scared.&quot; The end result is a film that couldn&apos;t be further from its origins: Abel Ferrara&apos;s 1992, in-name-only original (&quot;a very powerful, original film,&quot; says Cage), a harrowing Catholic guilt-trip orgy, in which Harvey Keitel wallows in self-abasement and bliss is never on the map, even though plenty of evil is. &quot;That&apos;s a perfect example of a film being more of a Judeo-Christian programme,&quot; notes Cage, &quot;where a man is dealing with enormous amounts of guilt and seeing visions of Jesus Christ and trying to cope with his wrongdoing. Whereas in our film, it&apos;s an existential experience, where people who do the wrong thing get rewarded. And, in this case, win.&quot; He pauses, perhaps thinking of his own opportunity for a reversal of fortune: &quot;And that also happens in life.&quot; Bad Lieutenant is out on Friday Nic Cage CV 1982 Fast Times At Ridgemont High Cage starts promisingly with a small part in the legendary frat comedy that launched the careers of Sean Penn, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Forest Whitaker.

Pitched battles continued to rage across the capital after a night of grenade explosions and gunfire, with soldiers shooting live rounds at protesters armed with petrol bombs, guns and homemade rockets. Since the fighting began on Thursday at least 22 people have died with 147 wounded as government forces attempt to seal off the 1 sq mile (3 sq km) zone that thousands of redshirt protesters have occupied in an upmarket district of the city. The spiralling violence, which has moved from street to street over the past three days, has raised concerns that Thailand is heading towards civil war. &quot;The situation right now is getting closer to civil war every minute,&quot; a protest leader, Jatuporn Prompan, said. &quot;We have to fight on. The leaders shouldn&apos;t even think about retreat when our brothers are ready to fight on.&quot; Another protest leader, Kwanchai Praipana, told Reuters that the prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, should resign and take responsibility for Thailand&apos;s deadliest political crisis in 18 years. He said supplies of food, water and fuel were starting to run out due to the government blockade of the protest camp, but there was enough to last some days. Abhisit defended the army crackdown, saying there was no turning back. &quot;The government must move forward. We cannot retreat because we are doing things that will benefit the entire country,&quot; he said in a national broadcast. The centre of Bangkok is now a battleground, with rolling skirmishes being fought between protesters from the redshirts&apos; compound, fortified with tyres and sharpened bamboo staves, and troops from hastily constructed, sand-bagged and razor-wired positions. The Thai army has designated the Ratchaprarop area as a &quot;live firing zone&quot;, meaning live bullets are being used. The protesters&apos; and troops&apos; positions are just a few hundred metres apart in most areas of the city. The areas between, some of the most exclusive addresses in Bangkok, are almost deserted. Shops have been closed and thousands of residents have fled. &quot;My ears are ringing with all the shooting last night,&quot; Ratana Veerasawat, a 48-year-old owner of a grocery shop just north of the protest encampment, told Reuters. &quot;It&apos;s just awful and getting worse. Best to leave now.&quot; The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-Moon, expressed concern over &quot;the rapidly mounting tensions and violence&quot;. A spokesman said in a statement: &quot;He strongly encourages them to urgently return to dialogue in order to de-escalate the situation and resolve matters peacefully.&quot; The redshirt protesters began their latest campaign to oust the government in March. Since then, at least 51 people have been killed and 1,620 wounded, according to government figures. The latest violence began after the fugitive army major general Seh Daeng, who led the redshirts&apos; paramilitary wing, was shot, allegedly by an army sniper. The government said that it would restore order &quot;in the next few days&quot; but a source close to the army chief, Anupong Paochinda, said the conflict was &quot;unlikely to end quickly&quot;. &quot;I am not scared,&quot; Sanae Promman, a 37-year-old protester, told Reuters. &quot;Some of my friends have left because they are scared but many are still here to fight.

The move came as one of the leaders of the redshirt protesters said that there would be &quot;civil war&quot; if the army did not pull back and declare a ceasefire. After two days of conflict, the army stepped up efforts to cut off the redshirts from the rest of the world, sealing off swaths of the city. Troops have erected signs at Ratchaprarop Road, on the northern edge of the redshirts&apos; camp, warning, in Thai and English: &quot;No Entry, Restricted Area. Live Firing Zone&quot;. Protesters still risked their lives to harass troops, drawing fire as they ran across the deserted streets to hurl rocks and bottles. Others, including residents caught out by the army&apos;s sudden move, were seen fleeing the area with their hands above their heads. Since violence re-erupted in Bangkok on Thursday with the shooting of renegade army general Seh Daeng, 24 people have been killed, bringing to 54 the death toll since 12 March. More than 1,100 have been injured, including more than 150 during the past three days. International bodies called for calm as the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, urged both sides to do everything in their power to avoid further loss of life. British ambassador Quinton Quayle and former US ambassador William Itoh have also called for the two sides to restart talks. In the middle of the sprawling encampment in the heart of Bangkok&apos;s shopping and finance districts, redshirt leaders remained resolute. Weng Tojirakarn, head of the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship, demanded the government declare a ceasefire and pull back its troops because &quot;we don&apos;t want to see a civil war. If it does happen, I don&apos;t know how many years it will take to end.&quot; Speaking publicly for the first time in two days, Thailand&apos;s prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, said that his administration was acting in the interests of the majority of Thai people. &quot;The government has no choice but to move forward [in ending the protest by force],&quot; he said in an address carried live on every Thai TV channel. &quot;We have tried every other method to bring this to an end.&quot; He asked that the people of Bangkok co-operate with the government&apos;s efforts and that protesters allow women and children to leave the camp. On the streets, however, there is a growing realisation that the impasse will not end without further bloodshed. Behind the fortifications of bamboo staves and fuel-filled tyres, the redshirt guards say they are prepared to face the troops when they march in. &quot;We are all very afraid,&quot; Somchai Sanwong said as he manned the barricades, a few hundred yards from troop positions. The redshirts have piles of rocks and Molotov cocktails stashed to hurl at troops when they finally advance. They also have gallons of motor vehicle oil to make the road slippery. Deeper inside the camp, sources say, the redshirts have dozens of M79 rocket-launched grenades. Several were fired last night at an inner-city police station. &quot;Obviously we&apos;re outgunned, outnumbered. In the worst case, if the soldiers come, we&apos;ll just burn the barricades,&quot; Somchai said. In the no man&apos;s land between the redshirt fortifications and the troop roadblocks, some of the streets in Bangkok are eerily quiet. Businesses are shut and thousands of residents have fled. The government says it has no timetable yet to order troops to march on the redshirts&apos; barricades. It intends, for now, to restrict the protesters&apos; communications and access to reinforcements, as well as supplies of food, water and power. After two days of porous army roadblocks that allowed supplies and thousands of extra protesters to reach the camp, movement in central Bangkok is now heavily restricted. Vehicles and bags are being checked at roadblocks for supplies, and only those who can prove they are resident or work inside the cordoned-off area are allowed in. Already there are reports of food shortages.

Some redshirt leaders indicated they would be prepared to return to negotiations immediately, but only if troops were withdrawn from the streets and the UN brought in to broker peace. &quot;We want the UN to moderate it because we do not trust anyone else.

The go-go bars in the garish sidestreets off Bangkok&apos;s Sukhumvit Road are opening for business.

We thought about not coming, but the person who was organising the trip said the protest had been going on for ages and it was pretty peaceful, so we figured it would be all right.&quot; Less than a kilometre from the bright lights and cheap beer of Sukhumvit, on Witthayu Road, a very different scene is unfolding. A protester is being taken to hospital, wedged between two men on the back of a scooter, although he is almost certainly dead. His blood seeps through clotted clumps of hair and runs down their bodies. The driver weaves at speed between the rocks and broken glass, the rubbish and the burning tyres that are the detritus of this street warfare. The man&apos;s limp, bare foot drags along the road, leaving a crimson trail. Moments earlier the Guardian saw the man crouching behind a wall of tyres, building a barricade designed to slow the progress of troops stationed a few hundred metres down the road. Gunfire had rung out steadily during the afternoon at this site in the city&apos;s embassy zone. The guns had been quiet for several minutes when the man, perhaps emboldened by the respite, ran forward to a new position. A single crack rang out and he collapsed. The two other men hurried, hunched over, to drag him back to a sidestreet and the motorcycle ride to hospital. This is how the battle for Bangkok has been and will continue to be fought. Street by street, inch by inch, casualty by casualty. Since Thursday, 31 people have died on the Thai capital&apos;s streets, as troops have marched on the protest site, ordered by a prime minister weary of negotiating with the anti-government redshirt demonstrators who want him ousted. The redshirts have occupied the shopping and finance districts for more than a month. Their sprawling one-and-a-half square mile fortified camp has crippled businesses and destabilised an already weak government. Over four days, pitched battles have been waged as troops squeeze in on the 6,000 or so still barricaded behind walls of tyres, bamboo staves and concrete. In most places, a few hundred yards of no-man&apos;s land separates the protesters from the troops. Where they can, the soldiers push forward, setting up new sandbagged positions and razor wire defences. In response, the redshirts seek to gain or defend whatever territory they&apos;re able, hastily constructing barricades made from tyres and car parts. Where they are threatened, they set their defences on fire. High above all, army snipers watch from the tall empty buildings. The reds have not yet lost substantial territory to the army, but the government says it is prepared to wait them out, starving the redshirts of food, water, power and contact with the outside world. After days of porous roadblocks that allowed supplies and extra redshirt supporters in, the army has now blocked off all roads leading to the protest camp. There are few ways in. Already there are reports the redshirts are running short of supplies. Scrambled mobile phone signals are making communications difficult, and the weariness of constant fighting is taking its toll. The reds&apos; leadership has indicated it is prepared to return to the negotiating table. It says it has only two conditions: that soldiers are withdrawn from Bangkok&apos;s streets immediately, and the UN is brought in to broker whatever peace can be salvaged. The government, though, appears determined to continue with its plan to forcibly remove the protesters. The request for UN intervention has been dismissed. This dispute is a matter for Thailand to solve, the government says, and international bodies have no place in this domestic dispute. Further violence seems inevitable. Back on Sukhumvit, the bars are quieter than usual. Rumours of a planned curfew have spooked some, and they are closing early.

Nor will anything resembling the basilica of the Sacr\u00e9 Coeur be built one day over the bodies of the fallen redshirts at the Ratchaprasong intersection in Bangkok. If anything celebrates the return of order in Thailand, it will be another shopping mall. But such is liberal democracy&apos;s antipathy to, or lingering fear of, revolution that its governing elites assume people have grown out of them, that the concept of political revolt is no longer in their DNA. Thailand&apos;s slow-burning political crisis may teach them otherwise. The longer this crisis continues, and the harsher the methods used to contain it, the harder it becomes to characterise solely as a colour-coded clash between two mutually exclusive tribes, the urban and rural poor against an establishment elite of royalists, bureaucrats and military generals. The longer it goes on, the more the fate of 5,000 people, many of them women and children, in their city centre encampment, develops its own dynamic. They are moving out of the shadow of their backer, the ousted oligarch and former premier Thaksin Shinawatra. He is a convenient figure to blame, but the truth is that the protest is beyond his control. After the deaths of another 29 people, all of them civilians, in the last four days of clashes, the mood on both sides of the bamboo and tyre barricades has hardened. One thing is clear: even if Thailand&apos;s military-backed government succeeds in wiping this unseemly blot of open dissent from Bangkok&apos;s city centre, the country&apos;s political order will never be the same. After five years, Thailand&apos;s constitutional order, already dislocated by the prospect of its first royal succession in six decades, is facing a crisis of legitimacy that is nationwide. The country&apos;s unelected prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, is often described as Eton- and Oxford-educated, as if this confers on him a set of values superior to the ones which have led to 18 actual or attempted military coups since 1933. But having hesitated and attempted to negotiate, he is reverting to type as a Thai establishment figure. His government yesterday rejected a plea from the redshirts for UN-mediated talks, although it has long been clear that Thailand&apos;s political system is broken. This was why the International Crisis Group called weeks ago for outside mediation, the winding down of protest and the creation of a government of national unity which would prepare for new elections \u2013 all eminently sensible ways of defusing the crisis and avoiding more civilian bloodshed. Instead, Abhisit appeared to have convinced himself yesterday that if he does not end the six-week occupation of Bangkok&apos;s business centre by force, the country would be on the verge of a civil war. It could be anyway. A state of emergency was imposed on five more provinces yesterday, bringing the total to 22 provinces, and whole neighbourhoods in the capital have been designated &quot;live-fire zones&quot;, a small step, as Human Rights Watch observed, from &quot;free-fire zones&quot;. In a televised statement hardening the government&apos;s stance, Abhisit declared he only had one gear and that was a forward one. There would be no retreat. This is the other face of the man who only a week ago offered to hold early elections this year. As he spoke, thousands more protesters were massing in another district of the capital, and there were signs of unrest spreading to the north and north-east of the country. Thailand is not Burma or China, and a bloodbath would do more than just paralyse south-east Asia&apos;s second-largest economy and decimate its tourism. The Thai government cannot shoot its way back to political order and then pretend to hold elections as if nothing had happened. But the signs last night were ominous.

A rocket hit the 14th floor of the Dusit Thani Hotel, a Reuters photographer said, triggering gunfire from &quot;all around&quot; in pitch blackness, since power had been cut to the area. Guests at the Dusit were evacuated on Monday morning after spending much of the night cowering in the basement.   The government estimates that 5,000 people are hunkered down in the protest camp (It was 10,000 before the latest violence erupted last Thursday). They have been ordered to leave by around now or face criminal charges.  9.15am: The deadline for protesters to move from their camp has passed, but thousands of them remain and they are in a defiant mood, according to our man in Bangkok, Ben Doherty. He says they have continued to ignore warning as troops edge closer to the camp. &quot;It seems, that given the mood on both sides of the barricades there is only one way that this will finish and that is with more violence and more deaths,&quot; Ben says.   9.43am: The conflict continues to be played out on YouTube. The protesters appear to be using children as human shields according to this footage that was apparently filmed in the live fire zone.            This shows the risks press photographers are taking to capture images of the violence. And here redshirt protesters are shown hiding behind barricades made of tyres in what is described as the &quot;Battle of Bon Kai&quot;.  9.59am: There is &quot;very very very heavy gunfire in Soi Rangnam&quot; according to the Twitter stream of BangkokGarrett. It is one of a number of Thailand tweeters put together in this list by my colleague Adam Gabbatt. Other useful Twitter lists on the protests include @XinJeisan/thailand, @JoeSmeets/bangkok-situational and @LambertSt/thailand      Ben Doherty for Adam    10.16am: Here&apos;s more from Ben:  &quot;All day the Thai army has been using armoured troop carriers to move soldiers beyond their positions towards the red-shirts fortified camp. The troops are rolling out coils of razor wire across new streets, claiming more and more of the no-man&apos;s land between their sand-bagged defences and the redshirts&apos; guards. They are also working to clear routes for larger vehicles through the rest of the city.Popular tourist strip Sukhmuvit Road is progressively being shut down by the army, who are blocking off side streets and moving traffic away from the thoroughfare. It appears the military is getting ready to move troops in, rapidly, to confront the red-shirts at their barricades.&quot;    10.29am: There were chaotic scenes at Seh Daeng&apos;s funeral according to Mark MacKinnon, the East Asia correspondent for Canada&apos;s The Globe and Mail. He has posted some pictures of the ceremony to Twitpic.       10.36am: Peter Jenkison, an English resident in Bangkok, emails  &quot;It is s getting rough out there again and it seems that the army is intent on finishing this to try and root out the armed faction. It is going to be very bloody but Thailand has a history of moving forward politically through the spilling of blood. This is well known to the organisers of this faction and the people on the streets are cannon fodder. Please tell Ben Doherty to keep his head down as they have been specifically targetting journalists as well as medical workers.&quot;    10.43am: Here&apos;s a map of latest incidents in Bangkok. It was put together by my colleague Adam Gabbatt who has been plotting Twitter updates and other reports as they emerge. He will continue to update the map with more information.   View Bangkok red shirt protests in a larger map    10.59am: Freakingcat&apos;s YouTube channel is worth following. A recent video show protesters building a barricade with tyres.  Another, uploaded two hours ago,  shows an overview from a bridge across a motorway in the city.            The Guardian has also posted a new video of the latest agency footage from Bangkok.  11.18am: The army&apos;s tactics are a sign of weakness, according to an interesting blogpost by the Southeast Asia analyst Josh Kurlantzick for the London Review of Books.      He writes:  &quot;The army&apos;s show of force is evidence of serious underlying weaknesses. Firing live ammunition at protesters and massing large numbers of troops is a lot easier than non-violent crowd control and dispersal, which requires a highly trained force, effective planning and intelligence, co-ordination among units and a unified mission, all of which are lacking in the Thai security forces.&quot;   11.23am: Adam is not the only one to be plotting the violence in Bangkok. Richard Barrow got there first with this map entitled &quot;Bangkok Dangerous&quot;.   View Bangkok Dangerous - Red Shirts Rally March-May 2010 in a larger map    11.31am: This video is causing much interest. It shows that the police are willing help wounded protesters. Hundreds of people are also seen chanting for the prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to resign.             11.50am: There are concerns that a petrol truck in central Bangkok could explode, after reports that it was fired at. TV footage shows the truck close to flames.  11.59am: That video of a toddler apparently being used as a human shield (9.43am) has been removed from YouTube. But it can now be seen on Twitvid.      Pedestrians stop to watch smoke rise from burning barricades in Bangkok, Thailand. Photograph: Wally Santana/AP    12.05pm: Our picture desk has put together a new gallery of the latest images from Bangkok.  12.18pm: The 3pm (9am BST) deadline passed without incident at the main encampment, according to Reuters.  But fighting continued on the periphery east and north of the area, which troops were struggling to seal off. &quot;We will keep sending warnings to protesters and will slowly step up pressure if they don&apos;t go,&quot; said Thawil Pliensee, secretary-general of the National Security Council, adding there was no immediate plan to clear the main camp by force.    1.20pm: Cracks are emerging in the ruling coalition over the government&apos;s hardline approach to the protesters, the prolific Thai blogger Bangkok Pundit reports. A leader from the Bhum Jai Thai group, which is popular in the north east, has expressed unease about the violence, the post says.      Ben Doherty for Adam    1.43pm: Ben Doherty has emailed a new update from Bangkok  &quot;Continued gun-battles at a number of flashpoints across the city. Rama IV Road has been particularly violent. Protesters have pushed a petrol truck out onto the road, and are attempting to set it alight by shooting fireworks at it. So far they have proven unsuccessful. There is intense fighting too in the blacked-out streets of Bon Kai. Homes and businesses are being set on fire. In the middle of the protest compound, speakers and singers are on stage, while the protesters eat, shower and prepare for another night on the streets, not knowing what tomorrow will bring. Night has fallen in Bangkok. The darkness brings with it a new menace.&quot;   1.45pm: As the stand off continues, Reuters has put together useful guide to four scenarios on what could happen next:  1 Troops move towards protest site, major classes ensueThe military has battled protesters for four days but has managed to secure only some parts of central Bangkok after prolonged clashes.In coming days, military reinforcements arrive and troops move on the site but encounter heavy resistance as they approach the huge, makeshift walls around the camp. Red shirt guards hurl rocks and petrol bombs. Troops respond with deadly force and armed elements within the movement fire back with hundreds of guns and grenades believed to be hidden inside the encampment.Hundreds of protesters arrive outside the camp and challenge the army from behind. Pitched street battles continue for days at different locations, with troops making no significant gains. Casualties are high on both sides and pressure mounts on prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to resign.Likelihood: The protesters have proved in the last few days they are willing to fight all the way. If the military is perceived as aggressive, they are likely to fight back in bigger numbers. 2 Army surrounds protest site, both sides agreed to dialogue The military overcomes resistance from protesters and moves to the edge of the perimeter around the encampment. The army threatens to use deadly force to evict them.Defiant red shirt leaders realise the game is over and the government is not bluffing. They appeal for immediate talks to prevent a massacre.The red shirts no longer have bargaining power. They agree to disperse after the leaders are offered some kind of amnesty or an early election is guaranteed. Peace is restored momentarily.Likelihood: This is also a plausible scenario. Both sides are playing a high stakes game and have taken the crisis to the brink. Neither wants a bloodbath and neither wants to admit defeat. Talks would allow both sides to claim victory. 3 Crackdown takes place, protest site is clearedTroop reinforcements and armoured vehicles arrive. The military makes it clear it will enter the Rachaprasong intersection and many protesters, faced with death, agree to leave. Left behind are hard-core demonstrators willing to fight to the death.Attempts to disperse the crowd are complicated by armed elements among the protesters. Mysterious but well-trained gunmen allied with the red shirts appear and a full-scale urban gunbattle ensues with many dead and injured on both sides.Street skirmishes ensue as angry protesters attack troops in response to the bloodshed. Violent demonstrations take place in rural provinces which security forces cannot control.Abhisit is forced to resign because of the huge loss of life. A new prime minister from his coalition takes over.Likelihood: It&apos;s possible. No side wants to engage in a catastrophic battle with unprecedented deaths. This scenario would signal the end of the road for both Abhisit and the red shirt leaders and is therefore unlikely. 4 Military retreats after failed mission, PM resignsTroops continue to engage in fierce clashes, which escalate to battles with armed militias at several locations next to the walls to the encampment. The hardcore red shirts have a strategic advantage, occupying roofs of tall buildings and an elevated rail system.The battles go on for several days and both sides suffer big casualties. The presence of civilians complicates the army&apos;s operation. Trained gunmen within the protesters overwhelm the troops. The military retreats and the government is humiliated.Abhisit is forced by his powerful backers to step down and a new prime minister, a member of his coalition deemed acceptable to the public, takes over in a caretaker role. But the protests continue. Calls for a new election to end the crisis come from multiple sides and a date is set for early polls. The protest rally finally ends.Likelihood: Not likely. Abhisit and the army would be totally humiliated if troops retreat after such a show of force. The government would rather finish what it started - regardless of the casualties - than endure the embarrassment of a withdrawal.   2.10pm: Protest leaders held a meeting after being contacted by the prime minister office, according to the Bangkok Post. Several thousand protesters, including women and children, remain in the redshirt camp after the government&apos;s deadline came and went, it reports.  2.52pm: The attack on the Duist Thai hotel (8.58am) was ominous, according a post by 2Bangkok. The post says the hotel is the &quot;one remaining immediate vantage point at the south end of the rally site and also host to many of the foreign press.&quot; The closure of the hotel eliminates a viewing point over an area where fighting is likely to be intense, it says.  3.02pm: That already infamous video clip of a child apparently being used as human shield by protesters (11.59am) has become part of the official propaganda campaign against the redshirts. It has just been shown at a televised press conference by the government&apos;s Centre for Resolution of the Emergency Situation.  3.17pm: One of the leaders of the red shirts has called the prime ministers office to propose a ceasefire, according to a snap from Associated Press.  3.35pm: AP has more details on that phone call to an aide to the prime minister.  Korbsak Sabhavasu says he received a call on his cell phone Monday from Nattawut Saikua, one of the leaders of the Red Shirts, and they talked for five minutes. Korbsak said he told Nattawut that if the Red Shirt fighters retreat to their encampment &quot;there will be no single bullet fired by the soldiers.&quot; At least 37 people have been killed in fighting between troops and Red Shirt protesters who are demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, the dissolution of Parliament and new elections.   3.38pm: A series of graphic images of the latest violence by the Thai photographer, Songwut Phattanasilaporn have been posted to the ThaiLiberal fourm . The emailer who spotted them says they show clashes in the Bon Kai area of Bangkok.  3.57pm: It&apos;s coming up to 10pm in Thailand and that&apos;s it for today.

The Thai prime minister has ordered the bloodiest crackdown Thailand has seen in 50 years against the anti-government United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD). The redshirts, as the UDD are more commonly known, have been camping in the business district of Bangkok since March. Operation Rajprasong, which started on 14 May, has claimed the lives of at least 36 demonstrators. The government called the protesters \u2013 armed with slingshots, rocks and Molotov cocktails against the soldiers with M-16s and long-range rifles \u2013 &quot;terrorists&quot;. More than 100 have been injured in the crackdown, among them journalists and tourists. Prior to the operation, political observers expected the situation to diffuse and eventually end in a political compromise. The government offered to dissolve parliament in September and call for a fresh election on 14 November. The offer seemed ideal, especially since the redshirts&apos; last appeal was for the government to dissolve the house in 30 days. However, within just one week, the government hastily brushed aside their offer and used a more combative approach. They imposed a state of emergency in Bangkok and 22 north and north-eastern provinces, which are known strongholds of the redshirts, and have sent in military snipers claiming to &quot;end the protest once and for all&quot;. Why did the Thai government swiftly shift its position of compromise to a more aggressive approach akin to that of its neighbour, the Burmese military junta? The offer from the government was meant to be a show of force. It was a strategic step taken in advance to justify a well-planned massacre. The government knew well beforehand that it would be rejected. The kind of deals they offered would never have been acceptable to the redshirt leaders and their supporters. And they knew it. The &quot;peace deal&quot; meant to barter fresh elections in exchange for slapping redshirt leaders with charges under the terrorism act for their &quot;role&quot; in the military crackdown on 10 April, which left 21 protesters and five soldiers dead. Abhisit and the deputy prime minister, Suthep Thaugsuban, on the other hand, would be able to run free with impunity. The terrorism charge is so serious that those slapped with it are rendered unbailable. The redshirts, as a result, moved against the government with a counter-demand. They agreed to turn themselves in and disperse their followers only if the government leaders, particularly the deputy prime minister, were to be charged for murdering protesters. Dr Kengkij Kitirianglarp of Kasetsart University&apos;s faculty of social science, said: &quot;The assassination on Major General Khattiya Sawasdiphol [also known as Seh Daeng] is the last piece to a full-scale crackdown, as many believe that in the eyes of the government, the crackdown would be easier without Seh Daeng, the person regarded as the security strategist for the redshirts.&quot; This indicates that, deep down, the government knew the deal would not go far. It was just a ploy to legitimise the planned crackdown, arguing that these &quot;terrorists&quot; want to create a civil war by rejecting the offers. The Democrat party, which dominates the government, knows that if a fresh election were held, it has a slim chance of getting back into power. The redshirts&apos; affiliate (but now defunct) People&apos;s Power party had won an overwhelming landslide in the last election. Only after the judicial coup dissolved the People&apos;s Power party did the military-backed Democrat party become government. The story of the not-so-savvy clean man ends here. Abhisit schemes, knowing clearly where his plan will lead to. It is obvious that he will now carry on with it, not caring if dozens of people are killed. All this so he can continue being the head of government of Thailand.", "publicationDate": "2010-05-17T16:30:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Protest", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/17/thailand-protest", "title": "Thai leaders planned this crackdown | Pokpong Lawansiri", "sentences": ["The redshirts, as the UDD are more commonly known, have been camping in the business district of Bangkok since March.", "They imposed a state of emergency in Bangkok and 22 north and north-eastern provinces, which are known strongholds of the redshirts, and have sent in military snipers claiming to &quot;end the protest once and for all&quot;."]}, {"article": "Major-General Khattiya Sawasdipol, who has died aged 58 in hospital after being shot in the head last Thursday, was the security chief of the Thai anti-government redshirt movement. The redshirts, representing the rural poor but lacking any clearly defined leadership, are currently camped out in the centre of Bangkok, protesting against what they see as an illegitimate government supported by the military. In protests since mid-March at least 65 civilians, soldiers and protesters have been killed and more than 1,600 injured. A renegade in the view of the Thai army, which suspended him in January for &quot;repeatedly defying orders from his superiors to not get involved in political movements, particularly with the redshirts&quot;, Sawasdipol was known by the title Seh Daeng, or Red Commander. He compared himself with William Wallace, the Scottish warrior played by Mel Gibson in the 1995 Hollywood epic, Braveheart. Some Thais saw him as a hero, others as a dangerous villain. In his controversial career he made many enemies. He always wore his green military uniform among all the multitude of red-clad protesters, which made him an easy target for his former army colleagues, as he strutted around inspecting the redshirt security zones and barricades. The redshirts \u2013 known formally as the UDD (United for Democracy and against Dictatorship) \u2013 seized an upmarket Bangkok commercial centre on 3 April, and then became locked in a bitter and bloody confrontation with the Thai government. Sawasdipol was charged with terrorism, and Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva linked him to a series of grenade and bomb attacks on government and army installations in support of the UDD. His cult-hero status derived from his bestselling books detailing his operations with the CIA during the secret anti-communist war inside Laos, which continued until the mid-1970s, and covert operations in the Indonesian province of Aceh. In 2008, in violation of military discipline, he went public in his support of Thaksin Shinawatra, ousted as prime minister in 2006, and in March 2010 he was warmly welcomed at the billionaire&apos;s prime residence in exile in Dubai. Sawasdipol was formerly a Thai ranger and recruited many former rangers to be security guards for the UDD tented city in Bangkok. In one recent interview he openly declared that he had 300 armed men trained for &quot;close encounter&quot; and armed with M79 grenade launchers. In other interviews he denied he was the leader of the military wing of the UDD. When a senior military officer was killed by sniper fire on 10 April, he told the media that it was the work of a shadowy unit supporting Thaksin inside the military, dubbed the Ronin Warriors (a reference to the era of Samurai warriors in Japan). He strongly denied he was the leader of this death squad, but confirmed government claims that it existed. The prime minister&apos;s offer on 3 May of an early general election as part of a peace and reconciliation deal received qualified endorsement from the UDD leadership, but was swiftly denounced by Sawasdipol. He even accused moderate redshirt leaders of being in collusion with the government. Some Thai analysts believe that Sawasdipol, with his Rambo style, played a major role in scuttling the one small window of opportunity for a peaceful resolution of this bitterly protracted conflict. He was quoted as saying: &quot;The prime minister and the redshirts were on the verge of striking a deal, but then I came in.&quot; He was himself apparently shot by a sniper, while giving an interview to a New York Times reporter in which he described himself as leading a people&apos;s army preparing for a clash that would be &quot;free-form ...

Hundreds of children remain behind the barricades of the fortified red-shirt compound, hours after a government deadline for them to leave passed, and as troops prepare to remove all demonstrators by force. On Thai television tonight, an army spokesman, Colonel Sansern Kaewkamnerd, showed a photo of a young boy being held to stand atop the tyre barricades built by the protesters to hold back advancing troops. &quot;The reason why officers can&apos;t go into the area is because of this \u2013 the terrorists are using children and women as their shields,&quot; the officer said. It is not known how long the boy was held on the barriers or how close troops were to him. Allegations of various abuses are part of the ongoing public relations battle being waged by both sides for the hearts and minds of the Thai and international communities. But already one child has been killed in the violence which has raged in Bangkok for the past five days. A 14-year-old boy was shot in the stomach by soldiers when the van he was travelling in failed to stop at a checkpoint on Saturday. For two days details of his death were excluded from the official statistics of the number of people killed \u2013 which has now reached 36. Both sides of Bangkok&apos;s deepening political divide now say more violence appears inevitable, with a key protest leader saying their stand will end with potentially hundreds dead \u2013 &quot;our Tiananmen Square&quot;. Desperate last-minute negotiations collapsed in acrimony today and the government has vowed not to negotiate again with red shirt protest leaders while demonstrators remain on the streets. Sources told the Guardian the army was planning to march on protesters in the early hours of Wednesday. Some 6,000 people remain within the sprawling compound in Bangkok&apos;s shopping and finance districts, camped behind barricades of tyres, concrete and sharpened bamboo staves. At least half are women and hundreds are children. One protester, Kanok Boonmee, told the Guardian she had no family to place her eight-year-old son Gee with while she supported the red shirt movement. &quot;There is nowhere else for him to be,&quot; she said. &quot;This protest [is] important for Thailand, he wants to be here [to] change our country.&quot; But other parents said they had sent their children to stay with relatives out of Bangkok, as the violence worsened. Dozens of families also remain trapped in the blacked-out suburbs of the no-man&apos;s land between the red shirt barricades and troop lines. The government had demanded that all children, women and elderly people leave the central city protest site by 3pm Bangkok time today, before troops moved in. Protesters who left before the deadline would not face charges, the government said, but those who remained would be treated as criminals. But efforts to encourage protesters to leave became mired in bureaucracy and mistrust. Several hundred people who gathered at a meeting point at a temple inside the contested area found that the promised transport to take them to safety had not come. Elsewhere across the capital, firefights between troops and protesters raged on, with red shirt rocket attacks against luxury hotels housing foreigners. The red shirts also attempted to blow up a gas tanker rolled on to a major road on the southern edge of the conflict. The Dusit Thani hotel, housing more than 100 foreigners, was targeted by a grenade attack from within the red shirt compound. There were no injuries, but guests were evacuated and the hotel is now closed. A red shirt leader, Sean Boonpracong, told the Guardian he feared the protest would end as Thailand&apos;s Tiananmen Square, with hundreds more dead. &quot;The people are defiant. They do not trust the government. They don&apos;t want violence, but they are prepared to fight with their bare hands. The government does not want to negotiate, so I think many more people will die. This will end as our Tiananmen Square.&quot; Another key red shirt, Jatuporn Prompan, said only the intervention of Thailand&apos;s King could prevent more bloodshed. &quot;As people in this country, we would like his kindness.

At a minute before 6pm, the sweating bodies come to a halt. Elsewhere in the park courting couples rise from the grass and soccer-playing families call their kids to order. In a moment the national anthem will ring out, casting immobility and an enforced silence on everyone. I&apos;ve witnessed the scene more than once, and it never ceases to be amazing, a small-scale symbol of a society which, for all its commercial glitz and appearance of modernity, desperately needs reform. The anthem brought no crowds to their feet last Sunday or the one before that, since Lumpini park was nearly deserted. It is close to the eye of the street confrontation between the Thai government and army and the anti-establishment redshirts that has left scores of people dead. Thailand&apos;s current crisis is many things. In part it is a class war involving improverished farmers of the north and east who fear the loss of their land to corporate logging and other forms of agribusiness. In part it is a struggle between two types of politics: on one hand the old inward-looking army-based and royalist elite and its padded bureaucracy which faced no challenges for decades; on the other the globalising capitalism of a tycoon like Thaksin Shinawatra who used control of the television stations he owned to take advantage of universal suffrage to mobilise a mass following. Thailand is not a country of ostentatious inequalities with urban slums on the scale of Indonesia or India\u00a0\u2013 though under the concrete network of Bangkok&apos;s myriad flyovers there are plenty of wretched shacks. The\u00a0wealth gap is largely hidden because it is geographically determined. In spite of some emigration, more than two thirds of Thais still live in the countryside, and close to half are classified as poor. In the cities the new middle class has not proved to be the great driver of democracy that many pundits predicted. Most of its members tend to support the government&apos;s efforts to quell reform, including the latest street protests. The first requirement now is for the government to accept the redshirts&apos; call for talks. It is true that its tentative agreement to hold early elections in November broke down because hotheads in the protest movement refused to withdraw their barricades. But Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva should not then have rescinded his concession and sent in the army. Once again, his behaviour suggests the army is still the dominant ruling power. He has already failed to fulfil earlier promises to rein in security force abuses in the largely Muslim south, where a separate insurgency shows no sign of abating. Behind the army is the royal palace. While his courtiers have cultivated an image of him as a man above the political battle, the king has endorsed every military coup throughout his 60-year reign. Yet few Thais dare say this because of the ferocious laws on l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 that have seen hundreds of blog sites closed and other naysayers arrested. The time has surely come when Thailand needs to change its constitution, andbecome a modern parliamentary democracy. The King has been in hospital since September. His absence creates a vacuum which should be filled by a caretaker government of national unity to prepare for an autumn election and launch a commission on reducing the powers of the monarchy. Kasit Piromya, the foreign minister, has been busy over the last week telling foreign diplomats not to interfere in the crisis but, paradoxically, it was he who recently articulated what many Thais have been saying privately for months. In a speech at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in April, he said: &quot;The positive sign of Thai political development is the ordinary people ... participating in the political process as opposed to Thailand 15 years or 20 years ago, where political actors were confined to the bureaucrats, to some of the business people, to some of the professional politicians, to some of the military officers.&quot; He went on: &quot;Hopefully, with the traumatic violent experiences that we will come through, we can have a democracy that combines representative democracy with a direct democratic participation. More to the tune of Lichtenstein or to the Swiss model combined with the UK parliamentary system.&quot; Then came the bombshell: &quot;I think we should be brave enough to go through all of this and to talk about even the taboo subject of the institution of the monarchy ... Let&apos;s have a discussion: what type of democratic society would we like to be?&quot; Well said, Kasit Piromya. First, avert any more bloodshed on Bangkok&apos;s streets. Then let Thailand&apos;s national immobility and enforced silence, symbolised by Sundays in Lumpini Park, at last come to an end.", "publicationDate": "2010-05-17T22:00:02Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/17/redshirts-talks-democracy-thailand-monarchy", "title": "What kind of democracy does Thailand want to be? | Jonathan Steele", "sentences": ["Every Sunday afternoon hundreds of Thais flock to Lumpini park in central Bangkok for an hour or more of synchronised gymnastics to the rhythm of thumping speakers.", "Thailand is not a country of ostentatious inequalities with urban slums on the scale of Indonesia or India\u00a0\u2013 though under the concrete network of Bangkok&apos;s myriad flyovers there are plenty of wretched shacks.", "First, avert any more bloodshed on Bangkok&apos;s streets."]}, {"article": "A clever-dick lawyer on the airwaves today was solemnly warning trade unionists that they must be more careful in the way they comply with labour laws governing strikes \u2013 as &quot;part of the price they pay for some of the privileges they have&quot;. M&apos;learned friend was talking in the context of the latest court ruling that blocked the proposed 20 days of strike action by the Unite union&apos;s BA cabin crew \u2013 the 5,000 members of the Daily Mail-reading Bassa section who are fighting an uphill battle to preserve their pay and conditions. What a load of pompous self-serving nonsense! I hope BA didn&apos;t pay him for this stuff. He&apos;ll be persuading chief executive Willie Walsh to let him try to injunct that Icelandic volcano next. After all, it&apos;s been disrupting BA flights too. What happened in Mr Justice McCombe&apos;s court yesterday \u2013 now subject to an attempted appeal today \u2013 was as foolish and wrong as the union says it was: a &quot;landmark attack&quot; on its right to take industrial action. Why? Because the judgment rested on the union&apos;s alleged failure properly to inform its members of the result of its February strike ballot \u2013 the one imposed by a court ruling in December that an earlier ballot had included some members who had left BA&apos;s employ. This is technical stuff about websites, noticeboards and crew rooms \u2013 not to mention Unite&apos;s failure to mention 11 spoiled ballot papers. Clever-dick lawyers had gone through the 1992 Trade Union Act looking for loopholes \u2013 and found them. Two important points arise. In December it could be argued that the union had mismanaged the ballot \u2013 though the result was overwhelming. So the court may have done the union a favour. But this technical complaint clearly had no impact on the outcome of the ballot: it was a legal niggle based on a clerical error. But what it does is throw into stark relief the increasing difficulty facing unions seeking to use their legal rights to withhold their labour. In a free society, that&apos;s wrong and I am disappointed \u2013 rather than surprised \u2013 that the civil liberties lobby does not display alarm today. As I type the issue is not on the front of Liberty&apos;s website. Do I think the strike is a smart thing to do by staff whose terms and conditions are better than those of many rival airlines at a time when the industry is in deep trouble around the world for a host of reasons, not all of them volcanic? No. But that&apos;s not the point. In Willie Walsh they face a tough manager who says he does not want to break BA&apos;s unions but makes a good stab at sounding as if he does \u2013 as Dan Milmo explains in today&apos;s Guardian. Unite, itself the product of mega-merger (a bit like BA and Iberia: the result of weakness) has trouble with Bassa and faces an internal contest for the general secretaryship shortly. On air this morning Derek Simpson, Unite&apos;s outgoing joint No 1, sounded calm and lucid. Employment tribunals do not automatically use technical/clerical mistakes to justify upholding claims, so why should other courts, he asked. There is a wider point here. If people do not feel they have legitimate channels through which to air grievances they will resort to illegal ones. That is what riots are about \u2013 from Athens to Bangkok. At the start of a new Conservative-Lib Dem government with a clean sheet, Whitehall should be sensitive to the point. The cuts it plans to make in the public sector \u2013 jobs and services \u2013 will make militancy more likely. Grievance needs to have an outlet \u2013 however irritating and inconvenient to customers \u2013 or it will develop into more damaging trends. Among other things this government was elected to show more sensitivity to civil liberties than the last lot. Ending complicity in rendition, torture, bugging and the denial of bed and breakfast to gay couples are all part of that agenda, the part that most exercises the imagination of middle-class campaigners.

Before dawn, thousands of troops, many wearing balaclavas, massed at key points on the perimeter of the sprawling compound. More than a dozen armoured personnel carriers, mounted with machine guns moved into position on Rama Four Road on the southern edge of the conflict zone. The movement of troops came amid sporadic gunfire and after rumours overnight that the military was preparing a final push to clear protesters from their site. Troops marched up Sukhumvit Road, usually a popular tourist haunt, moving to within 150 metres of the redshirt fortifications. Soldiers, using loudspeakers, told all people in the area to return to their homes and extended their blockades around the protest site. Gunfire also broke out around the Silom Road area, the scene of some of the fiercest fighting in recent days. The redshirts have soaked many of their barricades, built from tyres and bamboo staves, in petrol, ready to set them alight if they are attacked, while several buildings in the conflict zone&apos;s north have already been set on fire. Early this morning a helicopter was seen flying over the protest site, warning that troops were preparing to move on the site. &quot;Please leave immediately. Officials are about to conduct an operation.&quot; But army spokesman Colonel Sansern Kaewkamnerd has refused to comment on any move on protesters. &quot;I will not answer any questions,&quot; he told reporters. For six days Thai army troops and anti-government redshirt protesters have fought pitched battles across the city, as the protesters have sought to defend their camp from incursion. Thirty-nine people have been killed in the fighting, and nearly 300 injured. After offering an amnesty for demonstrators who left the protest site before a deadline on Monday afternoon, Thai TV this morning carried warnings from senior army generals that anybody left would be treated as a criminal. Thailand&apos;s government rejected the protesters&apos; latest offer to negotiate yesterday and insisted there would be no talks until the dwindling anti-government movement abandoned the areas of central Bangkok it has taken over. The redshirts are demanding that prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva dissolves parliament and calls early elections. They say the current administration came to power through manipulation of the courts and the backing of the powerful military. The standoff deteriorated into street clashes last Thursday after a military adviser to the redshirts was shot by an apparent sniper, just after the army surrounded the protest zone in an attempt to cut off supplies of food and water. Fiery battles have raged between soldiers firing live ammunition and hundreds of rioters with homemade weapons. Protest leaders have argued over whether they should continue to resist the crackdown. The government estimated that 3,000 people remain in the downtown encampment, down from 5,000 on Sunday and 10,000 last week. On Tuesday, the mood in the core protest zone was subdued, with none of the dancing and festivities that previously lent the area a carnival-like atmosphere. Periodically, protest leaders delivered fiery speeches, meant to keep the crowd motivated. But Tuesday&apos;s responses were not as full throated as before. Gone also were most food vendors, while mounds of rotting garbage are piled up outside the camp&apos;s sharpened bamboo gates.", "publicationDate": "2010-05-19T01:02:33Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Protest", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/19/thai-army-prepares-red-shirt-bangkok-crackdown", "title": "Thai army prepares crackdown on redshirt protesters in Bangkok", "sentences": ["The Thai army appeared this morning to be preparing for a final crackdown on redshirt protesters who have occupied a fortified central Bangkok protest site for more than a month.", "Thailand&apos;s government rejected the protesters&apos; latest offer to negotiate yesterday and insisted there would be no talks until the dwindling anti-government movement abandoned the areas of central Bangkok it has taken over."]}, {"article": " 7.15am: The worst fears about the situation in Thailand appear to be being borne out today as the Thai army move in against thousands of redshirt protesters in central Bangkok.  Using armoured vehicles they broke through make shift barricades in an operation that killed at least four people. Two journalists were among 50 people wounded and one western journalist, identified as an Italian is believed to dead. Here&apos;s a graphic account from Associated Press:  Surreal scenes of warfare erupted in one of the ritziest parts of the capital, as troops armed with M-16s marched through the central business district past upscale apartment buildings to retake the area around manicured Lumpini Park, which has been under the control of protesters camped there for weeks. Government spokesman Panitan Wattanayagorn declared the first stage of the army operation to secure the area around Lumpini Park successful and said that some protest leaders had fled.  He asked the public to inform police if any of the leaders were spotted. However, two of the three key leaders remained in the protest zone giving defiant speeches and singing on a stage, as troops drew closer. An AP reporter who followed the troops into the protest camp saw the bodies of two men sprawled on the ground, one with a head wound and other apparently shot in the upper body. They were the first known casualties in the assault that began before dawn on a 1km square stretch of downtown Bangkok that protesters have occupied. Troops fired M-16 rifles at fleeing protesters and shouted: &quot;Come out and surrender or we&apos;ll kill you.&quot; An AP photographer saw three foreign journalists shot. One was an Italian photographer shot in the chest. His eyes were rolled back and he showed no signs of life. A Dutch journalist walked into the hospital with a bullet wound in his shoulder.

Shortly after 6am, fierce fighting broke out as troops began moving on the redshirts fortifications, four-metre walls of bamboo staves and tyres. As armoured personnel carriers, backed by heavy fire from soldiers, pushed into the barricades, protesters set fire to them, sending huge plumes of black smoke into the sky.Many protesters turned and fled, but troops met fierce resistance from a hardcore element within the red shirts group. I saw protesters armed with assault rifles firing on troops as the soldiers made their way north up Ratchadamri Road. Outnumbered and lacking firepower, however, the protesters suffered serious casualties. As the fighting intensified, shot demonstrators were being rushed to waiting ambulances.  I saw a Thai man shot as he crouched behind an ambulance which came to rescue him. After coming under fire the ambulance retreated leaving the man stranded in the street. Soldiers also moved through the adjacent Lumpini Park, the biggest park in central Bangkok, backed by personnel carriers. Moving up Ratchadamri Road, troops fired indiscriminately. Journalists, ambulances and paramedics all attracted fire. The army moved slowly and deliberately early, pausing after breaching the redshirts&apos; fortifications to check for bombs and booby traps. Protesters offered determined early resistance, but many then retreated and troops were able to progress more quickly through the camp. Retreating redshirts&apos; set fire to shelters and the hastily-constructed barricades behind them. By midday Thai time (it&apos;s now 1.42pm) soldiers had managed to push nearly a kilometre into the camp. Government spokesman Panitan Wattanayagorn has appeared on Thai TV saying the operation to take control of the southern section of the protest site had been &quot;successful&quot;. He told protesters remaining in the middle of the sprawling protest camp that troops were moving on the site and they needed to leave now. He said the government had positioned buses on the western flank of the protest, and urged those who wished to leave peacefully to go to the buses where they would be evacuated. He alleged the reds&apos; protest leaders had escaped, but this has not yet been confirmed.It is estimated there are still some 3,000 protesters within the red-shirt protest zone.&quot;   7.44am: The redshirt leader Jatuporn Prompan has been shown on Thai television surrendering to the police, according to a Reuters live blog of the crackdown. Another leader has been shown under arrest. AP has this:  Thailand&apos;s Red Shirt protest leaders say they are formally ending their anti-government protest and will surrender to authorities to prevent more deaths. Seven Red Shirt leaders went on stage in the core protest zone to announce their decision, which was greeted with shouts of dismay from the men and women gathered around. Protest leader Natawut Saikua said &quot;we have done our best.&quot;  Weng Tojirakarn said &quot;we want to prevent further losses of our Red Shirt brothers and sisters.&quot; He said &quot;let us first prevent further losses of lives,&quot; and urged supporters to leave the area.   8.02am: Associated Press has footage of the troops moving in. The caption on YouTube reads: &quot;Thai troops opened fire at a fortified encampment of anti-government protesters in central Bangkok. It came amid reports of a final assault on the area the protesters have occupied for weeks.&quot;             8.22am: Bangkok has descended into open warfare, says Ben Doherty reporting from the Foreign Correspondents Club amidst the gunfire in central Bangkok.  You can hear shots firing as he says: &quot;This has been the day that Bangkok has feared for weeks now \u2026 this is the end game.&quot;      Thaksin Shinawatra Photograph: Apichart Weerawong/AP    8.28am: The former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, whom the redshirts back, said he feared the crackdown could lead to guerrilla warfare across the country.  &quot;There is a theory saying a military crackdown can spread resentment and these resentful people will become guerrillas,&quot; Thaksin told Reuters in a telephone interview, declining to say where he was.  He also denied an accusation by a top aide of the prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, that he was the stumbling block to the failed talks between the government and the redshirts.      Ben Doherty    8.40am: Ben says the violence is set to continue.  &quot;Smoke continues to billow from a pile of tyres set alight at the Chitlom railway station near the middle of the reds protest site. Since redshirt leaders have conceded their protest is lost, the gunfire has decreased in recent minutes, but there are still volleys being fired at the camp, and by reds protesters at advancing troops. It will take several hours before troops can be confident they have central Bangkok under control. Undoubtedly, there will be pockets of resistance from within the redshirts. Many in the paramilitary wing of the redshirts remain armed and have vowed to fight to the death. But even if this protest site can be brought under control, and peace restored to Bangkok, serious questions remain about Thailand&apos;s political future. This is a deeply divided country, and while this protest might be soon to end, the sentiment for democratic reform in Thailand, and for the removal of this government, will not go away. Prime minister Abhisit, and his country, face difficult weeks and years ahead. The antigovernment movement has massive support across the country. Across regional Thailand, redshirt supporters and sympathisers staged their own rallies. The Khon Kaen town hall was captured by protesters, in Ubon Thani they torched it.&quot;   8.59am: A curfew is to be imposed in Bangkok  tonight, the defence minister, Prawit Wongsuwon, has announced according to the Nation.       9.03am: Geoff Peace, a Bangkok resident, emails this:  The real story in Bangkok now is outside Rachaprasong. Just before lunchtime fires and rioting started all around the edge of the main part of the city. Although most of the redshirt leaders have surrendered the rest seem to have splintered all over the city and are bent on destroying the place. Just to be clear, the Army did what they needed to do very effectively today but it now looks like there will be random violence over the city and maybe in the regions too. That makes it more frightening than before.   9.10am: Thailand&apos;s Channel 3 TV station is seeking police protection from redshirt protesters, according to a tweet from a reporter from the Nation.  &quot;Cars have been smashed and building under siege,&quot; says an update.      Ben Doherty    9.24am: Ben has confirmed that report about the TV station being under siege.  &quot;Fleeing redshirts are torching Bangkok as they leave. Thai TV station Channel 3 is under attack from angry reds, and the Thai Stock Exchange building, a few kilometres from the protest site, has been set ablaze. Despite pleas from redshirt leaders for protesters to leave peacefully, many reds are angry and are looking to take out their frustration on anything they see as being representative of the ruling elite they have been protesting against.&quot;        9.31am: Staff at the Bangkok Post have been forced to flee their offices. Bangkok Post being evacuated, says its website.  The evacuation came after protesters have reportedly set fire on buildings around the Rama IV intersection. Reporters are heading to Wat Klong Toey Nai.   9.43am: The dead Italian journalist has been named as Fabio Polenghi.

One staffer said cars parked outside the building were set on fire and protesters then entered the Channel 3 building.&quot; There are reports that some staff are trapped inside the building.  10.21am: More details on that curfew, from Reuters:   Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva imposed a curfew in Bangkok on tonight from 8pm (2pm BST) until 6am tomorrow. The curfew \u2013 details of which were read out on national television \u2013 was meant to allow security authorities perform their duty, Abhisit said in the order.   10.27am: Andrew Marshall, a reporter for Time, is one journalist tweeting from Thailand.

And here&apos;s a extracts from AP&apos;s latest report:  Downtown Bangkok turned into a flaming battleground today as an army assault toppled the redshirt protest leadership, enraging followers who fired grenades and set numerous fires that cloaked the skyline in a black haze. Using live ammunition, troops dispersed thousands of anti-government protesters who had been camped in the capital&apos;s premier shopping and residential district for weeks. Four protesters and an Italian news photographer were killed in the ensuing gun battles and about 60 wounded. After redshirt leaders gave themselves up to police, rioters set fires at the Stock Exchange, several banks, the headquarters of the Metropolitan Electricity Authority, the high-end Central World shopping mall and a cinema complex that collapsed.  The government declared a nighttime curfew in Bangkok, and said army operations would continue through the night. An announcement signed by Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and broadcast on television said nobody in the capital was allowed out of their homes from 8pm until 6am unless they have permission from authorities. Protesters also turned their rage on the local media, which they have accused of pro-government coverage. They attacked the offices of state-run Channel 3, setting fire to cars outside and puncturing water pipes that flooded the building. Cabinet minister Satit Vongnongteay described the chaos as anticipated &quot;aftershocks.&quot;&quot;There are violent-prone protesters who remain angry,&quot; Satit told a news conference.   1.19pm: More on those attacks against the local media, who according to AP, have been accused of pro-government coverage by protesters.  Channel 3 news anchor Patcharasri Benjamasa was tweeting for help from the television stations offices earlier today: &quot;At Channel 3 need urgent help from police, soldiers!!!&quot;, Benjamasa tweeted. &quot;News cars were smashed and they are about to invade the building&quot; AP said hours later the building was on fire. Channel 3 executives were evacuated by helicopter while police rescued other staff.  The Guardian has posted a video of the scenes in Bangkok, showing tanks moving into the redshirts camp.  2.03pm: The curfew has now begun but the fighting continues. Mark MacKinnon, from Canada Global and Mail is giving a running commentary on Twitter on fighting outside the Wat Patum temple in central Bangkok.      Here&apos;s a selection from the last two hours in chronological order:  Firefight outside temple escalating. Hundreds of people still sheltering inside. Air smells of fire. Twenty buildings around city said to be in fire, including Central World. At least one person inside temple has bullet wound. No idea what happened. Gunfire escalating. Fighting rages all around temple. Teargas in the air. At least three shot, either inside or just outside sanctuary. At least five wounded around me at makeshift medical centre in park behind Wat Patum temple, one a friend and colleague \u2026 gunfire continues. Somehow we&apos;re the only corros left in temple. People around us terrified. Red Cross can&apos;t get ambulance in to injured because of gunfire.   2.20pm: By opting to use military force against the redshirt protesters, the Thai government has lost the opportunity to craft a settlement for an orderly transition, writes Duncan McCargo.  Nobody should be fooled into thinking that this conflict is over. Whether the fires are quickly extinguished or continue to burn for many nights to come will depend on the willingness of the Thai authorities to act pragmatically, and to listen to voices of reason.  McCargo also narrates an powerful audio slide show on the background to today&apos;s events for the US Asia Society.  2.25pm: Scores of videos have been uploaded to YouTube today showing smoke over the Bangkok skyline. Here is footage from street level of that blaze at the shopping mall Central World (see 12.21pm).             2.33pm: Another disturbing update from the Canadian journalist Mark MacKinnon.  2.42pm: People are being shot at in Victory Monument, which surrounded by troops according to an unverified report on a red shirt Facebook group. It also links to footage of a fire at the city hall in Khon Kaen in north east Thailand.  2.52pm: Confirmation that violence is not confined to Bangkok \u2013 Reuters reports that the overnight curfew has been extended to 21 provinces across Thailand. The curfew extension was posted on TV channels, now under the control of the government. The provincial curfews followed arson attacks and protests in at least seven provinces, which included the torching of town halls in three major cities, all of which were strongholds of the anti-government protest movement.  3.11pm: Here&apos;s a summary of a very violent day in Bangkok \u2022 At least six people have been killed and 60 injured, after the Thai army stormed the redshirts camp in central Bangkok.  \u2022 One of those killed Italian photojournalist Fabio Polenghi (9.43am).  \u2022 There are fears that the death toll will increase sharply. For example medics reports that seven people are dead inside a temple in central Bangkok (2.33pm) and there numerous reports of shooting. \u2022 Several red shirt leaders have surrendered to police and urged followers to do the same. But many anti-government protesters have reacted violently to the army crackdown.  \u2022 Scores of prominent buildings have been torched including the stock exchange, shopping malls, and banks in Bangkok. Outside Bangkok offices and city halls have been attacked.  \u2022 Journalists have been forced to flee their offices after protesters took out their anger on the Thai media which is seen as sympathetic to the government. The Bangkok Post and Channel 3 television were both evacuated.  \u2022 The government has taken over broadcasting on all TV channels. \u2022 A night curfew has been imposed in Bangkok and 21 provinces. \u2022 Thaksin Shinawatra, whom the redshirts back, said he feared the crackdown could lead to guerrilla warfare across the country  3.25pm: ITN has this posted this report on today&apos;s events to YouTube.             3.34pm: The Nation is keeping a tally of the fires in Bangkok. It reports (via its Facebook group - it&apos;s own site is very slow to load) that out of the &quot;27 gutted spots&quot; 19 are banks. The redshirt radio station urges followers to torch the banks, according to Ben Doherty (12pm). Time magazine confirms this. &quot;A radio station aligned with the Red Shirt movement urged supporters to unleash &quot;all out arson.&quot;  4.06pm:  The Thai prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva is giving a speech on television in the country. It&apos;s hard to get reliable updates of what he&apos;s saying but he seems to be explaining why the government felt it necessary to impose a curfew.  @tulsathit, who works for the Nation, is live-tweeting the speech. He says the PM has praised the rescue workers and urged residents to be vigilant. Here&apos;s a selection of his updates. \u2022 &quot;PM: Plesse cooperate with measures issued by Govt.&quot; 3 minutes ago via TweetDeck \u2022 &quot;PM: Please be our eyes and ears.&quot; 3 minutes ago via TweetDeck \u2022 &quot;Our security forces are doing the best they can to bring back normalcy. I want to give u this confidence.&quot; 2 minutes ago via TweetDeck This is Adam Gabbatt taking over after Matt&apos;s stirling work, by the way.  4.27pm:  The Canadian journalist Mark Mackinnon, who Matt mentioned earlier (2.33pm), has sparked dozens of retweets on Twitter since posting this desperate message two hours ago: Mackinnon was in Wat Patum temple with several injured people unable to get to the hospital due to the violence. His message has been retweeted by over 100 people, and seems to have had the desired effect - here&apos;s another tweet from Mark at around 4.15pm: @markmackinnon Thanks to all who Rt. we got all injured out in ambulances. Twitter may just have done this. 12 minutes ago via mobile web  4.36pm:  Reuters has more on Abhisit Vejjajiva&apos;s television address. It is reporting that the Thai prime minister said he believed his government could soon restore peace and order to the country. &quot;I am confident and determined to end the problems and return the country to peace and order once again,&quot; Abhisit said.  4.43pm:  Max Tunon, who has been working in Bangkok for the UN for the last nine months, is currently at the airport waiting to flee the city. While he was waiting he spoke to Matthew Weaver from an internet cafe in the airport.  &quot;Until last week I was living in an apartment near redshirts camp, so I was living in the middle of a rally for a month. It was relatively peaceful then. But when the violence broke out last week I moved out to a hotel on Sukhumvit.  It was about 1 km from the protesters encampment but until today the street had been totally unaffected. There were rumours since last night that a crackdown would start at dawn. It did. They moved slowly but steadily to the main rally site. Until around noon things were relatively straightforward. Then there was a small explosion near the Sheraton on the crossroads of Sukhumvit and Asok. It was serious enough to make the T-shirt vendors on the street finally pack up. It was the first time I was genuinely afraid since I&apos;ve been here. The violence was so indiscriminate. There was smoke all over the cityscape. This is huge. The fires are out of control all over the city, so what was just affecting the shopping malls - is now affecting everyone. I popped out to get some supplies as the curfew was announced. They were warning everyone to stay indoors. I saw smoke billowing from next to the Sheraton and some guys throwing rocks - either at the hotel, or at the police.  I had to walk about 2 kms before before I could get a taxi to the airport. Loads of people were trying to find taxis before the curfew started. I had a flight planned for tomorrow and didnt want to get stuck. I wanted to stay overnight in the airport hotel - but they are all fully booked. Then I managed to get on an earlier flight. I only felt relief when I found out I had a flight. I&apos;m hoping to return when the situation is bought under control.&quot;   4.58pm:  @tukky_nt has tweeted a link to the video below showing the Central World shopping mall ablaze.            @vaitor, a journalist, is defying the curfew to post updates from Bangkok. Earlier he reported Central World was unstable, and commented on &quot;dead silence&quot; on the streets. He&apos;s just tweeted: &quot;more ambulances leaving red area. central world is still standing, just some walls fall down...&quot;  5.06pm:      Matthew Weaver    &quot;The Independent&apos;s Andrew Buncombe was one of the foreign journalists who have been injured in the clashes. He was hit in the leg but is OK. His injuries were confirmed by the Independent, according to the travel writer Andrew Spooner \u2013 a reliable source. Meanwhile the press freedom campaign Reporters Without Borders has expressed dismay at the shooting of the photojournalist Fabio Polenghi. He is the second journalist to die in the crisis, following the death of Reuters cameraman Hiroyuki Muramoto. In a statement Reporters Without Borders said: &apos;With two journalists killed and five wounded, the toll on the media has been heavy, while many others have only narrowly escaped death. We are stunned and outraged by the indiscriminate nature of this assault, which shows that the Thai authorities made little attempt to protect journalists in their desire to suppress the red shirt opposition &apos;As in the case of Hiroyuki Muramoto, we call for an independent investigation into Fabio Polenghi&apos;s death, including an autopsy and a ballistic study carried out in a transparent manner and, if necessary, with the help of foreign experts.&apos;&quot;  5.21pm:  Witnesses say at least six more bodies from the Bangkok unrest are lying in a Buddhist temple in the protest zone, according to Associated Press. If true the deaths would bring today&apos;s toll to at least 12.  They say the temple, Wat Pathum Vanaram, was supposed to be a sanctuary for protesters from the street violence but troops have yet to secure the surrounding area.Hundreds of people fled there after the army launched a crackdown to end a two-month standoff in the Thai capital.Medical volunteer Anan Thongniem said the dead included two protesters, one protest &apos;guard&apos; and two medics.   5.30pm:  My Twitter list of people tweeting from Bangkok is still buzzing, and worth checking out. Obviously not all reports will be completely accurate but it offers a fascinating picture of what&apos;s going on.  Get in touch @adamgabbatt if you&apos;ve any suggestions of people I can add.  5.42pm:  A journalist called Igor Prahin has been updating his Flickr stream regularly today with shots of burning buildings in Bangkok. His series of photographs titled Bangkok on Fire is particularly impressive.  6.00pm:  That&apos;s it for today, thanks for reading and for all your comments.

Fierce fighting broke out as soldiers advanced on the redshirt protesters who, for more than a month, had occupied the protest site, ringed with four-metre walls of bamboo staves and tyres. Amid heavy fire from the troops, armoured personnel carriers pushed into the barricades which protesters set on fire, sending plumes of black smoke into the sky. Soldiers fired at fleeing protesters and shouted: &quot;Come out and surrender or we&apos;ll kill you.&quot; The onslaught set off a volley of attacks on other sites across Bangkok, including the stock exchange, newspaper offices and one of Asia&apos;s largest shopping complexes. The violence spread to north-east Thailand, a redshirt stronghold, where protesters stormed a town hall complex in the city of Udon Thani, setting a building ablaze, and torched a second town hall in Khon Kaen. The Thai prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, reacted to the unrest by imposing a curfew in Bangkok running from 8pm to 6am tomorrow. He said the order was needed to allow the security forces to do their duty. An AP reporter who followed the troops into the camp saw the bodies of two men sprawled on the ground, one with a head wound and the other apparently shot in the upper body. They were the first known casualties of the dawn assault. An AP photographer saw three foreign journalists shot. One, an Italian photographer, is reported to have died after being hit in the chest. Italian media have named the man as Fabio Polenghi, a 45-year-old Milan-based photojournalist who was on assignment in Thailand for several magazines. He was identified by a friend from television images, the Ansa news agency reported. A Dutch journalist walked into hospital with a bullet wound in his shoulder while a third journalist, a 53-year-old American documentary filmmaker, was treated for a gunshot in the leg. After troops had overrun the camp, four redshirt leaders said they were abandoning the protest and would surrender to police. The announcement was greeted with shouts of dismay from the men and women gathered around. One protest leader, Natawut Saikua, said: &quot;We have done our best&quot;. Another, Weng Tojirakarn said: &quot;We want to prevent further losses of our redshirt brothers and sisters.&quot; He urged supporters to leave the area, adding: &quot;Let us first prevent further losses of lives.&quot; Grenade blasts were reported as the protest leaders were led away by police. Angry demonstrators then vented their fury by attacking the stock exchange and the offices of local media, whom they accuse of pro-government bias. Staff at the Channel 3 television station said their building had been attacked by protesters. One employee said cars parked outside the building were set on fire and protesters then entered the Channel 3 offices. Journalists at the Bangkok Post and the Nation said they were evacuating their building after threats from the redshirts. Rioting was seen in five areas of the city as protesters lit fires and burned tyres. Some hotels set up wooden barricades. As the violence intensified, the former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra \u2013 who is backed by the redshirts \u2013 warned that the country could slide further into civil unrest. &quot;There is a theory saying a military crackdown can spread resentment and these resentful people will become guerrillas,&quot; said Thaskin, who has been living in self-impose exile since being ousted in a coup in 2006 and convicted of corruption. He denied an accusation by a top aide of Abhisit that he was the stumbling block for failed talks between the government and the redshirt leaders. Before dawn, thousands of troops, many wearing balaclavas, had marched through the central business district to retake the area around Lumpini park, which has been under the control of protesters camped there for weeks. Many demonstrators turned and fled, but troops met angry resistance from a hardcore element within the redshirt group. Protesters armed with assault rifles fired on troops as the soldiers made their way north up Ratchadamri Road. Outnumbered and lacking firepower, the protesters suffered serious casualties. As the fighting intensified, wounded demonstrators were being rushed to waiting ambulances. By midday, soldiers had managed to push half a mile into the camp. A government spokesman, Panitan Wattanayagorn, appeared on television saying the operation to take control of the southern section of the protest site had been successful. About 3,000 protesters were estimated to be within the redshirt protest zone. For six days Thai army troops and have fought pitched battles across the city against protesters trying to defend their camp from incursion. Thirty-nine people have been killed in the fighting, and nearly 300 injured. Thailand&apos;s government rejected the protesters&apos; latest offer to negotiate yesterday and insisted there would be no talks until the dwindling anti-government movement abandoned the areas of central Bangkok it had taken over. The redshirts had demanded that Abhisit dissolve parliament and call early elections. They say the current administration came to power through manipulation of the courts and the backing of the powerful military. The standoff deteriorated into street clashes last Thursday after a military adviser to the redshirts was shot by an apparent sniper, just after the army surrounded the protest zone.", "publicationDate": "2010-05-19T07:30:19Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Protest", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/19/thailand-troops-storm-protest-camp", "title": "Thai troops storm redshirt protest camp", "sentences": ["     Thai troops in armoured vehicles stormed the fortified encampment of anti-government protesters in central Bangkok this morning, smashing through bamboo barricades in an assault that left at least three demonstrators and one journalist dead.", "Soldiers fired at fleeing protesters and shouted: &quot;Come out and surrender or we&apos;ll kill you.&quot; The onslaught set off a volley of attacks on other sites across Bangkok, including the stock exchange, newspaper offices and one of Asia&apos;s largest shopping complexes.", "The Thai prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, reacted to the unrest by imposing a curfew in Bangkok running from 8pm to 6am tomorrow.", "Journalists at the Bangkok Post and the Nation said they were evacuating their building after threats from the redshirts.", "Thailand&apos;s government rejected the protesters&apos; latest offer to negotiate yesterday and insisted there would be no talks until the dwindling anti-government movement abandoned the areas of central Bangkok it had taken over."]}, {"article": "Clearing demonstrators from the streets using military force is messy enough, but in a major political conflict like Thailand&apos;s, the sweeping-out operation is really the easy part. Despite almost reaching a negotiated settlement with the protesters last week, the Thai authorities have ordered security forces to overrun the main redshirt encampments in central Bangkok, arresting major leaders and apparently shooting dead at least four people, including an Italian journalist, in a continuation of ham-fisted military tactics already condemned by Amnesty International. The decision to use force against redshirt protesters was immediately applauded by government supporters - including many long-suffering Bangkok residents - but the costs of such a heavy-handed crackdown will be extremely high. By opting for a military rather than a security solution, the government has lost the opportunity to craft a settlement for an orderly transition. A roadmap based on a plan for early elections in November had offered a possible way forward, and intermediaries, including the senate speaker and activist academics, had sought to broker further dialogue between the two sides. The UN also made a couple of overtures of assistance, which were immediately rebuffed by the government. Following the death on Monday of renegade general Khattiya Sawasdipol, better known as Sae Daeng, of wounds inflicted by a sniper, the redshirts had lost their most hardline opponent of compromise. Sae Daeng and his contingent of men, serving as a self-appointed security detail for the redshirts, had been a key factor in resisting earlier attempts to disperse the protests. The government now had the upper hand in any talks, and the demonstrations were probably within a few days of collapse. The authorities&apos; show of force today inflamed intense feelings of frustration, resentment and rage among the protesters, who had camped out for more than two months in 90F (32C) temperatures. Bangkok today is an angry city of impossible contradictions and unfathomable hatreds. The end of the formal protests solves nothing; indeed, it seems to be ushering in a new and even more disturbing phase of random violence and mayhem. The deep-rooted tension between pro- and anti-Thaksin networks have not gone away. These conflicts date back several years, reflecting a basic divide between two competing colour-coded patronage-based networks. The redshirts are broadly allied with former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. They remain incensed that he was ousted in the disastrous September 2006 military coup which did nothing to dent his electoral support, especially in the populous north and north-east. Opposing them are the yellowshirts, who are a royalist movement sympathetic to the present Democrat Party-led administration, the military and the bureaucracy. For them, Thaksin represents the dark side of Thai capitalism, seeking cynically to subvert the country&apos;s traditional institutions and values for his own advancement and advantage. The divide between the two sides transcends social class and regional origin, splitting families and households across the nation. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the issues \u2013 and the popular image of the redshirts as non-violent pro-democracy underdogs is woefully simplistic \u2013 normalcy will not be restored in Thailand until a genuine accommodation is reached between the two sides. Such an accommodation might take the form of a political deal, a power-sharing arrangement, or some kind of substantial decentralisation. Elections are needed, sooner rather than later, as part of this process. Nobody should be fooled into thinking that this conflict is over. Whether the fires are quickly extinguished or continue to burn for many nights to come will depend on the willingness of the Thai authorities to act pragmatically, and to listen to voices of reason. \u2022 Duncan McCargo is professor of south-east Asian politics at the University of Leeds and author of Tearing Apart the Land: Islam and Legitimacy in Southern Thailand (Cornell University Press), which won the inaugural 2009 Bernard Schwartz prize from the Asia Society", "publicationDate": "2010-05-19T12:33:20Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Protest", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/19/thailand-redshirt-protests-military-crackdown", "title": "Thai protests: military crackdown only widens divide", "sentences": ["Despite almost reaching a negotiated settlement with the protesters last week, the Thai authorities have ordered security forces to overrun the main redshirt encampments in central Bangkok, arresting major leaders and apparently shooting dead at least four people, including an Italian journalist, in a continuation of ham-fisted military tactics already condemned by Amnesty International.", "The decision to use force against redshirt protesters was immediately applauded by government supporters - including many long-suffering Bangkok residents - but the costs of such a heavy-handed crackdown will be extremely high.", "Bangkok today is an angry city of impossible contradictions and unfathomable hatreds."]}, {"article": "Who are the redshirts? The redshirts are drawn largely from Thailand&apos;s rural poor, mainly from the north and north-east of the country. They are the electoral majority. Many are supporters of the fugitive former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted from office in a military coup in September 2006, accused of corruption and convicted on a charge of conflict of interests.  The movement grew out of a loyalty to Thaksin but has become more broadly focused, with its leaders claiming they want to bring a more representative democracy to Thailand. They regard the current government as illegitimate because it never won an election and instead was brought to power by a parliamentary election \u2013 engineered by the military \u2013 after the redshirts&apos; party was dissolved for electoral fraud and kicked out of parliament. Who is pulling the strings? The redshirts are an informal movement, with no real leadership structure or chain of command. Their leaders, an eclectic lot, include Weng Tojirakarn, a medical doctor and former member of the communist party; Veera Musikapong, a former member of Thaksin&apos;s Thai Rak Thai (Thais love Thais) party, which was dissolved; and Arisman Pongruangrong, a 1980s pop star-cum-political activist. Another leader, Seh Daeng, a renegade army major general, died in hospital on Monday after being shot in the head by a sniper last week. Who opposes the redshirts? The yellowshirts, or People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy, represent the ruling class in Bangkok, known as the amataya, or elite. They are the wealthy families, the military and the bureaucrats, who have long exerted a huge influence on Thai politics. They wear yellow because they claim also to represent the interests of the monarchy (yellow being the Thai king&apos;s representative colour). In 2008 they seized both the airport and government house, but in the current crisis the yellowshirts are nowhere. They flirted with the periphery of the impasse, but have never become significantly involved. What are the chances of a compromise solution? At the beginning of last week, the chances looked good; the government had offered the redshirts an early election in November and the reds had said they agreed &quot;in principle&quot; to the &quot;reconciliation roadmap&quot; offered by the prime minister. But negotiations foundered over demands from the reds that Thailand&apos;s deputy prime minister be arrested for ordering troops to move on protesters on 10 April, when 25 people were killed. The government then withdrew the offer of an early poll, and sent in troops to surround the protesters, cutting off their supplies of food, water, electricity and fuel. The latest military action, and the rioting and widespread unrest that followed, will serve only to further polarise the two sides. Does Thailand have a history of political violence and uncertainty? The Thai king, who is 83, has sat on the throne for 63 years, during which time he has witnessed more than 15 coups, 16 constitutions and 27 changes of prime minister.

The redshirts, largely drawn from the rural poor of north and north-eastern Thailand, resent what they regard as the Bangkok-centric Thai media, particularly the English-language newspapers in the capital, which they believe openly support the government and the Bangkok elite. This afternoon, with the redshirts&apos; protest collapsing, the offices of both the Bangkok Post and the Nation were evacuated after threats from retreating reds. Protesters also attacked the offices of the state-run Channel 3, setting fire to cars outside and puncturing water pipes that flooded the building. &quot;Channel 3 needs urgent help from police, soldiers,&quot; news anchor Patcharasri Benjamas broadcast on the social networking website Twitter.

Over the course of the two-month redshirt protests, attitudes to the media have fluctuated on both sides of the conflict. Overwhelmingly, before the violent collapse of their protest this afternoon, the redshirts supported the foreign media. They regarded the international press and broadcast organisations as the best avenue for spreading their message beyond Thailand. But this afternoon, with their cause lost, they turned on the media, threatening several photographers, particularly those shooting retreating redshirts looting and committing acts of arson.

As armoured personnel carriers rumbled on to Bangkok&apos;s deserted streets, thousands of troops fanned out in a cordon across the city, surrounding the redshirts&apos; fortified protest camp. The city still slept. Rumours of an early morning &quot;final crackdown&quot; by the Thai military had swept Bangkok overnight, but there had been rumours before, and nothing had happened. Today though, as dawn broke, the &quot;operation&quot;, in the cold parlance of the government spokesman, began. Troops made no attempt at secrecy, opening fire almost as soon as they entered the camp. The troop carriers, looking more like tanks, were driven at barricades of tyres and sharpened bamboo staves, the fortifications which had protected the redshirts, and marked their territory, for more than a month. The residents of the ramshackle camp were prepared, many of the hardcore elements having vowed to fight to the death. But sensing their stand was doomed, and prepared to burn their fortress if they couldn&apos;t hold it, they set it alight, having filled it with fuel for that purpose. Flames quickly consumed the structure, symbolic of long-maintained but crumbling resistance, sending massive plumes of acrid black smoke into the air. &quot;Many soldiers shoot, shoot!&quot; one protester said, pointing an imaginary rifle through the bars of the park fence. &quot;The redshirts don&apos;t have guns.&quot; However, as troops drew closer, and the firefight grew more and more fierce, several redshirts carrying handguns and assault rifles could be seen. Some tried to maintain the ruse, running with rifles wrapped in mats, but they were soon revealed as fighting intensified and the weapons were put to use. But for the most part, the protesters were hopelessly outgunned and overwhelmingly outnumbered. They tried to hold back troops by launching fireworks at them, hurling Molotov cocktails and bricks. The soldiers on the ground moved steadily closer and the fire grew steadily heavier. Flash grenades pushed resistance back. Snipers on an elevated railway took careful shots at unknowing protesters below. Under attack, the redshirts retreated into their protest camp, taking shelter where they could behind bins, cars and telephone poles. A few continued to hurl whatever weapons they could at the advancing line. I saw a man shot as he crouched behind a phone box. He rolled in the gutter, unable to stand, and cried out for help. Fellow protesters ran out, under a hail of bullets, to drag him to safety. But help was unable to reach other victims. One man, who had been gunned down in the middle of the road, lay stricken, alone and unmoving. An ambulance tried to reach him but was fired upon, and, ultimately, forced to retreat without him. With protesters and medical teams driven further back by the constant fire from troops, he disappeared from view, calling out for help. By mid-morning, the troop offensive had progressed several hundred metres inside the reds&apos; stronghold. Soldiers were working methodically, checking the abandoned cars, motorbikes, and tents for bombs and booby traps. Retreating to the north-western corner of Lumpini Park, protesters hastily constructed another barrier out of wood, rubbish, and discarded chairs. But the detritus of months of protesting and a week of violent fighting could barely hold back the troops. &quot;The Thai army is bad. They shoot Thai people,&quot; said one man, apoplectic with rage and crying, as he threw wooden pallets into a pile, pathetic defiance in the face of the onslaught. Meeting the new resistance at the top of Lumpini Park, the troops began firing indiscriminately. Bullets flew past, slamming into buildings and cars behind. As government troops slowly advanced on the very middle of the reds&apos; protest, the leadership gathered behind the stage at Ratchaprasong intersection to discuss what few options they had left. Walkie-talkies carried by subordinates crackled constantlywith news from all points of the protest, all of it bad. In the early afternoon, the redshirts&apos; leader, Jatuporn Prompan, stood on the main stage, smoke billowing from the crumbling ruins of his resistance, the sound of gunfire interrupting his words. After 68 days of protest, and more than one person killed for every one of those days, he urged the demonstrators at his feet \u2013 among them more than 1,000 women and dozens of children \u2013 to leave peacefully. &quot;Though the fight didn&apos;t reach our goal, we tried our best. Go home. We are sorry for not sending you home earlier. Go home safe.&quot; Many did. But as their leaders surrendered themselves to police to be charged with dozens of offences, including terrorism, hundreds of their acolytes took to the streets seeking to take their anger out on anything and anyone within reach. Shops were looted, buildings set on fire and journalists attacked. The Channel 3 news station was set on fire, and staff on the city&apos;s English-language papers, the Nation and the Bangkok Post, were evacuated after threats. Central World, the second-biggest shopping centre in Asia and a symbol of the wealth and privilege the redshirts resent, was torched and fires were lit in the stock exchange building. And the unrest spread beyond the capital. Across regional Thailand, redshirt supporters and sympathisers staged their own rallies. In Khon Kaen in the redshirt-loyal north of the country, the town hall was captured by protesters. In Udon Thani, it was torched. A spokesman for the prime minister appeared on television insisting the operation was &quot;successful&quot;, despite six dead and more than 60 injured. A curfew imposed over the whole city would show that the government, through the brute force of 30,000 troops on the streets, was back in control. But as the sun set over Bangkok, there was no peace. At least 20 buildings burned into the night, fighting continued and grenades were launched at targets across the city. As troops swarmed the streets below and gun battles continued to rage, I bunkered in a room on the top floor of a building in the middle of the red zone. Redshirt spokesman Sean Boonpracong sought refuge there too. Protesters burned a train station below, hurling tyres on to an already roaring blaze across the tracks. Boonpracong stared out of the window at the chaos that Bangkok had become. &quot;The red shirts are not resigned, they are enraged,&quot; he said.", "publicationDate": "2010-05-19T21:56:35Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Protest", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/19/thailand-bangkok-protest-bloody-surrender", "title": "Thai soldiers arrest protest leaders in bloody 'final crackdown'", "sentences": ["As armoured personnel carriers rumbled on to Bangkok&apos;s deserted streets, thousands of troops fanned out in a cordon across the city, surrounding the redshirts&apos; fortified protest camp.", "Rumours of an early morning &quot;final crackdown&quot; by the Thai military had swept Bangkok overnight, but there had been rumours before, and nothing had happened.", "The Channel 3 news station was set on fire, and staff on the city&apos;s English-language papers, the Nation and the Bangkok Post, were evacuated after threats.", "But as the sun set over Bangkok, there was no peace.", "Boonpracong stared out of the window at the chaos that Bangkok had become."]}, {"article": "     Rioting and fires swept through Bangkok today after Thai troops stormed the fortified encampment occupied by anti-government protesters, unleashing a wave of violence across the capital and other parts of the country. At least five demonstrators and an Italian journalist were killed in the military operation, which met fierce resistance from the redshirts. Protesters set fire to buildings including the stock exchange and south-east Asia&apos;s second-biggest shopping mall and attacked newspaper offices and a television station. Power was lost in the bustling Sukhumvit Road district, an area packed with tourists and wealthy residential complexes, hours after the army said the situation was under control. The prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, imposed a curfew in the city and 21 provinces across the country from 8pm to 6am .&quot;All of this has one goal, to bring peace and prosperity back to the country,&quot; Abhisit said in a broadcast the government forced every Thai television channel to broadcast live. The chaos erupted as soldiers advanced on demonstrators who had occupied the protest site in the centre of Bangkok for more than six weeks. Amid heavy fire from troops, armoured personnel carriers pushed through barricades of bamboo and tyres that the protesters had set on fire. Soldiers fired at fleeing protesters and shouted: &quot;Come out and surrender or we&apos;ll kill you.&quot; Protesters armed with assault rifles fired back at troops making their way north up Ratchadamri Road. Outnumbered and lacking firepower, the redshirts suffered serious casualties. Protest leaders offered to surrender as the soldiers surrounded them, but their supporters urged them to fight on, with many screaming and crying as gunfire rang out. Moments later, live television showed four redshirt leaders in police custody. An army spokesman said the protest site was under army control and the military had halted operations. Three grenades exploded outside the main protest site, badly wounding two soldiers and a foreign journalist, a Reuters witness said. Several media organisations, including the Bangkok Post and the Nation newspapers, evacuated their offices after a threat from protesters accusing them of biased reporting. About 100 employees of the Channel 3 TV station were trapped on the roof of their high rise office. Most were later rescued by helicopter. The violence spread to north-east Thailand \u2013 a redshirt stronghold \u2013 where protesters stormed a town hall complex in the city of Udon Thani, setting a building on fire, and torched a second town hall in Khon Kaen. Unrest was reported in seven other provinces. An AP photographer saw three foreign journalists shot in Bangkok. One, an Italian photographer, died after being hit in the chest. Italian media named him as Fabio Polenghi, a 48-year-old Milan-based journalist on assignment in Thailand for several magazines. He was identified by a friend from television images, the Ansa news agency reported. The death toll looks certain to rise. This afternoon, a Canadian journalist reported seeing six or seven bodies inside Wat Pathum, a temple near the torched CentralWorld shopping complex. At least 60 people are thought to have been wounded in the fighting. The former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who is backed by the redshirts, warned that the country faced more civil unrest. &quot;There is a theory saying a military crackdown can spread resentment and these resentful people will become guerrillas,&quot; said Thaksin, who has been living in self-imposed exile since being ousted in a coup in 2006 and convicted of corruption. He denied an accusation by a top aide of Abhisit that he was the stumbling block for failed talks between the government and the redshirt leaders. About 3,000 protesters were estimated to be within the redshirt zone. For six days, Thai army troops had fought pitched battles across the city against protesters trying to defend their camp from incursion. At least 40 people have been killed in the fighting, and more than 300 injured. The government rejected the protesters&apos; offer to negotiate and insisted there would be no talks until the anti-government movement abandoned the areas of central Bangkok it had taken over. The redshirts had demanded that Abhisit dissolve parliament and call early elections. They say the current administration came to power through manipulation of the courts and the backing of the powerful military.

Heavy and, at times, indiscriminate gunfire produced scenes of chaos. Protest leaders surrendered and implored their supporters to give up and go home, to prevent a bloodbath, but soon lost control. Militants on the losing side, some of them armed, vented their rage by torching the stock exchange, banks, a department store complex, two pro-government newspapers and a television station. A negotiated settlement between the government and red-shirt protesters had almost been reached last week, but it was rejected in the same way in which the government turned down a further attempt at mediation this week. The bloody scenes yesterday made a nonsense of the government&apos;s claim that they were prepared to talk to the red-shirts after the camp had been cleared. It was total defeat for those who had paralysed the centre of Bangkok for six weeks and it is difficult to see what dialogue could now follow. Once a key military adviser to the red-shirts, the renegade general Khattiya Sawasdipol had been killed by a sniper on Monday, there was a sickening sense of inevitability about the final showdown. The military&apos;s show of force can only have deepened the tension between the two political camps. This is not a classic struggle between disenfranchised pro-democracy activists and an elite which ignores elections and regularly stages military coups. Behind the red-shirts looms the exiled Thaksin Shinawatra, the former prime minister and oligarch deposed in a military coup, a man all too willing to urge his supporters to sacrifice their blood, without risking his own. Thaksin was a major force in the red-shirt camp but not the only one. Inevitably the protest attracted support from the urban as well as the rural poor. According to military estimates, 70% of the protesters came from Bangkok and its provinces, people far removed from farmers in the north and north-east regarded as Thaksin strongholds. And yes, it was also about the yawning democratic deficit, even though both the red-shirts and yellow-shirted People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (who occupied the seat of government for three months and seized Bangkok&apos;s airports) have played fast and loose with that word. The dispersal of the red-shirt camp is a temporary victory for the government of prime\u00a0minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. As the body counts mounts, and the eyewitness accounts of the shooting emerge, it will, alas, not be the last battle waged in this conflict.", "publicationDate": "2010-05-19T23:05:08Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Protest", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/20/thailand-protests-violence-red-shirts", "title": "Thailand: fanning the flames", "sentences": ["Bangkok became a battle zone yesterday as everyone knew it would, when the Thai army stormed the barricades of the fortified encampment of anti-government protesters.", "It was total defeat for those who had paralysed the centre of Bangkok for six weeks and it is difficult to see what dialogue could now follow.", "According to military estimates, 70% of the protesters came from Bangkok and its provinces, people far removed from farmers in the north and north-east regarded as Thaksin strongholds.", "And yes, it was also about the yawning democratic deficit, even though both the red-shirts and yellow-shirted People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (who occupied the seat of government for three months and seized Bangkok&apos;s airports) have played fast and loose with that word."]}, {"article": "     Thailand has extended a curfew in Bangkok for three more nights as troops rooted out small pockets of resistance and residents attempted a return to normal life following yesterday&apos;s assault on anti-government protesters. Bangkok has mostly fallen quiet after a night of rioting, sporadic fighting and fires sparked by the army push to clear the encampment that had been occupied by thousands of anti-government protesters for six weeks. Armed redshirt protesters who had fled to a temple near the encampment offered intermittent resistance overnight to troops outside, but hundreds of people who had taken refuge in the building were eventually coaxed out by police with loudspeakers. Six bodies were later found inside, bringing yesterday&apos;s death toll to at least 14. A government spokesman described the standoff as an operation organised by terrorists. &quot;This was organised violence,&quot; he said. Bangkok residents woke morning to find the streets still ablaze, with dozens of fires smouldering around the city. Central World, south-east Asia&apos;s second-biggest department store, was almost destroyed in yesterday&apos;s violence, its windows shattered and many of its steel beams collapsed. The protesters&apos; tented encampment in the heart of Bangkok&apos;s commercial district \u2014 an area lined with luxury hotels and shopping plazas \u2014 was patrolled by troops this morning and strewn with rubbish and clothing. A single redshirt flag in the rubble flew limply in the breeze until it was crushed by a bulldozer. Television channels have been ordered to air only sanctioned programmes, broadcasting images of bulldozers pushing aside tyre and bamboo barricades as workers in trucks, under the protection of troops, clean up the protest camp site. The unrest has severely hit Thailand&apos;s tourism industry, a key employment sector. Passengers at the main Bangkok airport have been halved to 60,000-70,000 daily and flights have been cut to 600 from 750 a day, the state Thai News agency reported. The stock exchange was badly damaged by fire. The market will be closed today and tomorrow and the Bank of Thailand said banks around the country would also stay shut. The whole week has been declared a public holiday in an effort to keep people out of central Bangkok. Authorities imposed the curfew across a third of Thailand after outbursts of unrest in seven regions, particularly in the north, a redshirt stronghold. Town halls were set ablaze in three northern areas. Yesterday&apos;s surrender of key redshirt leaders \u2013 and an apparent end, for now, to the violence that has killed at least 50 people and wounded nearly 400 in six days \u2013 could put the focus back on early elections and the &quot;reconciliation roadmap&quot; proposed by the prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, before the unrest. The redshirts, who claim Abhisit lacks a proper mandate after coming to power in a controversial parliamentary vote in 2006 with tacit military support, are calling for fresh elections. However, the prime minister withdrew an offer of new polls last week. The protesters are mostly drawn from the rural and urban poor and largely back the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a populist tycoon who was ousted in the 2006 coup. He lives in self-imposed exile to avoid a jail term after being convicted in absentia on conflict of interest charges. The redshirts started demonstrating in mid-March, demanding that the government step down and elections be held. More than 70 people have been killed and nearly 2,000 wounded since then. Thaksin warned yesterday that the country faced more civil unrest. &quot;There is a theory saying a military crackdown can spread resentment and these resentful people will become guerrillas,&quot; he said.

The government declared a state of emergency across 23 provinces, mainly in the north of the country, which is an anti-government redshirt stronghold. The discovery of the bodies took to 82 the total number of deaths during two months of clashes between government troops and protesters. The redshirts&apos; fortified protest camp in central Bangkok was stormed by troops early on Wednesday. Demonstrators had occupied some 300 hectares (740 acres) of the capital for more than a month. Sporadic gunfire between troops and protesters continued today as firefighters tacked the smouldering aftermath of more than 30 fires started by fleeing red-shirts. As troops continued to sweep the city on Wednesday morning, more than 1,000 redshirt supporters were discovered hiding inside the protest area, too frightened to come out and distrusting of a government offer to take them home. At the Pathuwanaram temple inside the redshirt zone, designated a refuge for those who wished to leave the protest peacefully, hundreds of demonstrators, mainly women and children, were reluctant to trust police or military offers of safe passage. The bodies of six protesters shot by troops were found inside the temple grounds. They had been shot in fierce fighting at the front gates. One woman, Nomfan, said she had spent four days in the temple, unable to leave the area before troops moved in. She said that while gun battles raged at the front gates on Wednesday, she feared troops would storm the temple. &quot;People came in bleeding yesterday. They had been shot and they died. The shooting was just outside. We were too scared soldiers would shoot us too.&quot; Protesters sheltering in the temple were coaxed to a nearby police station, and put on buses to their homes across the country. Just down the road, the Guardian found a group of more than 100 redshirt supporters, including several children, who had spent the night hiding in an underground carpark behind the Erawan hotel. Even after the fighting subsided they had been too frightened to walk the 80 metres to the temple. They were only willing to make the short journey in the presence of western journalists. &quot;We cannot come out [by] ourselves, [the] soldiers would shoot us,&quot; Mayaree, a redshirt supporter from Ayutthaya, said as she led fellow redshirts from the protest site. &quot;We do not trust the government, they tell the soldiers to kill redshirts.&quot; Unrest continues elsewhere, with redshirt rallies across the country.

The way out of this will require a return to parliamentary and constitutional processes, with revised rules and eligible political players acceptable to all sides. This difficult way forward, towards reconciliation, will require mutual recognition and accommodation between the two main sides. The riots and shocking arson attacks in Bangkok&apos;s central business district provide an intensified and more violent d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu of the redshirts&apos; rage and rampage in April 2009, when their street demonstrations degenerated into riots, forcefully dispersed by the same army units in operation this week. While the recent torching of central Bangkok has set back the capital&apos;s capitalist boom by a decade, damages to tourism and investment will be even more costly. For the reds, nothing has changed. They have rioted twice in as many years but their grievances remain unaddressed. For them, there is injustice in their systematic disenfranchisement through judicial dissolutions of their poll-winning parties \u2013 not once, but twice \u2013 and the banning of elected politicians. The anger towards the street-based ousting of their elected governments in 2008 by the pro-establishment yellowshirts and the army&apos;s brokerage of the government now in power still prevails.

Yet, without their leaders \u2013 who are in custody \u2013 they may resort to underground activities, including an overtly armed insurgency to establish their own Thailand away from Bangkok in the north and north-eastern enclaves, with their own media and social networks. While they are seen as disgraced by most Bangkokians, the redshirts will increasingly transcend Bangkok-centric Thailand without caring. They no longer accept the Thai state and the political system it upholds, because the system is seen as rigged, the odds stacked against them. What happens to them now will depend on Abhisit Vejjajiva&apos;s government, which is directly accountable for the 70-odd death toll \u2013 all civilian except for six soldiers. He pledged reconciliation and reform after the riots last year, but the consequent recommendations by parliamentary committees for constitutional amendments came to nothing. Further antagonism and alienation directed towards the redshirts have partly brought on these recent protests. Abhisit and his government had an entire year to bridge the divide and to bring them on side, but the result has been the opposite. It is difficult for the reconciliation process to make headway with a compromised and tainted prime minister presiding over it. Setting reconciliation efforts on a sound footing is the critical first step. Beyond that, a new electoral mandate will have to be established, which will need amendments to the army-supported constitution from the military coup of 2006-07, to balance electoral representation. It may also necessitate the expansion of the playing field to include some of the banned politicians. Many of them are unsavoury, but some are capable and moderate enough to work with the pro-Abhisit coalition. They could also provide alternative and more pragmatic leadership to the reds away and beyond former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The onus rests squarely on the pro-Abhisit powers-that-be and the oncoming government arrangement to bring the redshirts back into the fold. Lumping all of them under Thaksin&apos;s long and manipulative tentacles is and has been a mistake all along. Accommodating the rank-and-file redshirts and seeking and working with their more moderate leaders, including some of the banned politicians, may offer a way to bypass this association. Thailand&apos;s ultimate reconciliation centres on the redshirts beyond Thaksin, under a different leadership, and the pro-Abhisit establishment&apos;s willingness to accept the reds&apos; grievances and work to alleviate them with revised rules. A mutually agreed upon compromise would create an electoral environment whose results would have a greater chance of acceptance by the main stakeholders involved.", "publicationDate": "2010-05-20T16:36:47Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Protest", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/20/thailand-thaksin-redshirts-abhisit", "title": "Thailand's only hope lies in political compromise | Thitinan Pongsudhirak", "sentences": ["As Thailand picks up the pieces after Bangkok&apos;s worst-ever protests and street riots, the country is further away from peace and reconciliation than it was two months ago, when the redshirts under the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship took to the streets.", "The riots and shocking arson attacks in Bangkok&apos;s central business district provide an intensified and more violent d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu of the redshirts&apos; rage and rampage in April 2009, when their street demonstrations degenerated into riots, forcefully dispersed by the same army units in operation this week.", "While the recent torching of central Bangkok has set back the capital&apos;s capitalist boom by a decade, damages to tourism and investment will be even more costly.", "Yet, without their leaders \u2013 who are in custody \u2013 they may resort to underground activities, including an overtly armed insurgency to establish their own Thailand away from Bangkok in the north and north-eastern enclaves, with their own media and social networks.", "While they are seen as disgraced by most Bangkokians, the redshirts will increasingly transcend Bangkok-centric Thailand without caring."]}, {"article": "Dahlia &apos;Bangkok&apos; has large, flamboyantly ruffled blooms in shimmering red and copper held on sturdy, compact plants.

I felt as if I had stepped on to the set of Blade Runner; a scattered and disjointed fusion of skyscrapers and tangled neon-soaked streets bustling with life. It left me electrified and entranced. Six years later, I made this city my home. Friends were envious. I was excited. No one was warning me against it. &quot;Bangkok is much safer than London&quot; has been my recurrent refrain whenever asked about living in this sprawling capital. However, while I may have been mugged in my hometown of London, I have never seen anyone shot there by a sniper. At least 70 people have been killed and well over a thousand injured in recent political violence in Bangkok. Areas of the city were turned into a war zone as troops battled with protesters for more than five days before finally \u2013 and brutally \u2013 crushing the redshirt &quot;resistance&quot;. To suggest that this chaos and destruction came as a surprise would be disingenuous. I have had serious misgivings about the state of affairs in Thailand for several years, but have, like many others, pushed them to one side lest they interfere with my enjoyment of the weather, lifestyle and, of course, the food that has kept me so content in this country for nearly a decade. I was in a bar with three friends earlier this month. A little drunk and excitable, two of the friends, a journalist and a photographer, sought to convince the third, who works for a large US-based multinational, that Bangkok was a city on the brink of chaos. &quot;Why are you laughing? This country is going to hell. Mark my words, there will be deaths on these streets that you cannot imagine,&quot; the journalist said to the sceptical office worker. Perhaps her laughter was born from nervousness. I&apos;m not sure, but despite living here for eight years, she did not seem to recognise the storm clouds. Four days later at least four people had been shot dead on a street one minute&apos;s walk from that bar, and the office worker had evacuated her apartment to go and live in another part of the city. But it wasn&apos;t just the latest tensions \u2013 two months of protests, 25 deaths and 800 injuries on 10 April and the increased military presence on the streets \u2013 that portended darker days. Ignited by a military coup and against the backdrop of rising anxiety over the deteriorating health of the king and the continued meddling of a divisive, ousted prime minister from self-imposed exile overseas, protest movements have been growing, with opposing groups increasingly pushing their agendas on the streets rather than in parliament. Years of tensions have uncovered stark social and political fissures. As I watched television last Tuesday morning, a military commander, in a pooled presentation on all free-to-air stations, showed images from YouTube and other public websites of &quot;terrorists&quot; among the redshirts. While there are armed elements among the protesters, almost all those shot so far have been unarmed. As the urban battles continued, the government and military pushed their propaganda on television each day \u2013 these are &quot;terrorists&quot;, we must defend ourselves and the king and country. A significant number of Thais agree. This makes me uneasy. The rhetoric is nothing new. The delivery is nothing new. I can&apos;t help but identify these generals with a bygone era. But many in Thailand, it seems, do not want a new future; they are emotionally devoted to their past and fearful of what may come if the redshirts win. In May 1992, when dozens of protesters were shot dead by soldiers, the military also claimed it was acting in self-defence. Today there is no grilling from the local media. Many continued to support the crackdown, despite the rising death toll. International media, such as CNN, have been accused of pro-redshirt bias. Vile and hateful messages calling for the deaths of the protesters were unashamedly plastered on Facebook and other social sites. At a television awards ceremony on the evening of 16 May, as the fighting continued on the streets outside, an actor received his statuette and, as stars have done in the past, took the opportunity to make his political feelings known. &quot;If you hate father, if you don&apos;t love father any more, then you should get out of here!&quot; he said defiantly, in reference to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who Thais often refer to as &quot;father&quot;, and the alleged anti-monarchy sentiments of some redshirts. &quot;Because this is father&apos;s home! Because this is father&apos;s land!&quot; The well-dressed audience of the glitterati and light-skinned actors and actresses gave a standing ovation, punched the air in defiance; some wept. Such scenes of obsequious devotion and intense emotion are common when it comes to the monarchy. Due to societal and legal pressures, there is no room for discussion of the monarchy \u2013 a culture of self-imposed censorship increasingly ingrained over the 63 years of King Bhumibol&apos;s reign, permeating all areas of social and political interaction and defining, in many cases, what it means to be &quot;Thai&quot;. Everyone has an opinion on what the real issue behind this enduring crisis is: class struggle against an uncaring elite; a scorned megalomaniac former prime minister fighting to recover his ill-gotten gains and power; a battle to fend off a republican revolution. But what no one seems to have is a clear answer to how this all will end. I don&apos;t have any answers either. As I sit here in my apartment, awaiting another night of curfew, watching the sun set on a city still smouldering from a week of tragedies, I can&apos;t help but think that recent events will only further cement the country&apos;s already bitter divides and lead to more bloodshed. The consensus that held Thailand together and saw decades of economic advance is crumbling. Thailand must build a new future under a new image, but I fear this divided nation is not yet ready to face that painful truth.", "publicationDate": "2010-05-23T17:00:03Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/23/thailand-bitter-divide-bloodshed", "title": "Thailand's troubles aren't over | Ismail Wolff", "sentences": ["My first experience of Bangkok was in 1995.", "&quot;Bangkok is much safer than London&quot; has been my recurrent refrain whenever asked about living in this sprawling capital.", "At least 70 people have been killed and well over a thousand injured in recent political violence in Bangkok.", "A little drunk and excitable, two of the friends, a journalist and a photographer, sought to convince the third, who works for a large US-based multinational, that Bangkok was a city on the brink of chaos."]}, {"article": "It&apos;s not often you hear a director thank &quot;all the spirits and all the ghosts in Thailand&quot; in an award acceptance speech, as Apichatpong Weerasethakul did in Cannes on Sunday night. But even before he won the Palme d&apos;Or, it was clear that Weerasethakul was not your typical director. For the benefit of westerners stumped by Thai pronunciation, he often shortens his name to &quot;Joe&quot; \u2013 but his cinema makes no concession to foreign expectations. It&apos;s a stance that has paid dividends. In a Cannes competition criticised for including too many familiar faces and a rash of globalised arthouse-by-numbers entries, Weerasethakul&apos;s dreamy, mystifying Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives was a breath of fresh air. It&apos;s a movie full of questions that aren&apos;t always answered, of talking animals and embodied spirits, of borders between this world and the next. &quot;I&apos;ve been asked to explain it a lot in the past week,&quot; says Weerasethakul. &quot;I don&apos;t always give the same answer.&quot; We speak just before the 39-year-old director gets on the train from Cannes. It&apos;s the morning after the night before, and he&apos;s feeling &quot;kinda shocked, kinda surreal&quot;. His impressions are of &quot;a lot of photographs, meeting people like Mr [Tim] Burton, just trying to remember the whole thing. But now it&apos;s all starting to sink in and I&apos;m very proud. We&apos;ve worked three and a half years on this. It&apos;s a labour of love, so it means a lot.&quot; As the title suggests, Uncle Boonmee is steeped in Thailand&apos;s Buddhist faith and the possibilities of reincarnation; but it is no straight-faced art movie, what with a &quot;monkey spirit&quot; resembling Chewbacca, monks using mobile phones, and a love scene between a\u00a0princess and a catfish. It is based on\u00a0a\u00a0true story a Buddhist abbot told Weerasethakul about a man, called Boonmee, who claimed he could see his past lives when he meditated, &quot;playing behind his closed eyes like a movie&quot;. Boonmee had died by the time Weerasethakul heard the story, so this is not a biopic \u2013 more an imagining of what that movie might have looked like. The film also brings in Weerasethakul&apos;s own family history, and childhood memories of lo-fi horror movies and TV shows (lots of red-eyed monsters, shot in darkness to cover up their shoddy costumes). On the subject of reincarnation, Weerasethakul is ambivalent: &quot;I kind of believe in it, but the more I worked on the film, the more I started to question my beliefs. I wouldn&apos;t say I believe in it 100%. You need proof, and in this lifetime we probably cannot do that yet. But it&apos;s a\u00a0possibility I fancy.&quot; He heard the story of Boonmee while in north-east Thailand working on an art project called Primitive (partly British-funded and currently showing at the British Film Institute in London). Primitive was made in a village named Nabua, which in the 1960s was put under brutal military control by the Thai government, who regarded it as a haven for communists. Working with local teenagers, Weerasethakul&apos;s project sought to commemorate the region&apos;s history of executions, torture, rape and evictions through short films and multi-screen installations. Uncle Boonmee is tangentially related, he explains. &quot;They&apos;re two angles on how memory works in the same region. Because of [Nabua&apos;s] violent history, you have the repression of memories. People don&apos;t want to talk\u00a0about what happened there. With Uncle Boonmee, he remembers so much, so\u00a0I think there&apos;s a relevancy. The movie is very ancient in a way. It&apos;s like a lamentation of the landscape and the movie styles that nobody makes any more \u2013 they&apos;re both disappearing.&quot; (Among his influences, Weerasethakul cites the Chinese director Edward Yang, 1940s American avant-gardist Maya Deren and Iranian Abbas Kiarostami \u2013 his hero, whom he met in Cannes on\u00a0Sunday.) This region of Thailand is home to many of the redshirts who have been protesting in Bangkok these last few weeks. There have been insinuations that the Cannes jury was swayed by the fact that Uncle Boonmee comes from a bona fide political hotspot, an idea Weerasethakul dismisses. &quot;People can link the two things, but basically I talk about more universal matters. Yes, that includes oppression and freedom of expression, but [I&apos;m] not specifically referring to current events.&quot; He has fallen foul of the Thai authorities in the\u00a0past: he protested against proposed cuts to his 2006 film Syndromes and a Century (among them a scene depicting monks playing with a toy UFO), and he has campaigned for artistic freedom. In any event, Weerasethakul&apos;s films are far too gentle and subtle to register as strongly political. They are rooted in landscape, while also operating on planes far above immediate earthly concerns. He will never fill multiplexes, but his work will doubtless outlive most of the films that do \u2013 even now, while his career as a film-maker is only just beginning. &quot;We tend to establish a certain logic when we watch movies,&quot; he says. &quot;But for me they are more powerful and diverse than that. I want to open up the mysteriousness of life. You encounter things you cannot explain, and that&apos;s the joy\u00a0of living.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-05-24T21:01:02Z", "tags": ["Cannes film festival", "Culture", "Film", "Apichatpong Weerasethakul", "Cannes 2010"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/24/apichatpong-weerasethakul-palm-dor-cannes-interview", "title": "Apichatpong Weerasethakul: eclectic dreams", "sentences": ["This region of Thailand is home to many of the redshirts who have been protesting in Bangkok these last few weeks."]}, {"article": "A Briton arrested in Thailand faces years in jail, or even a death sentence, for urging redshirt rioters to burn down a shopping centre. Jeff Savage, a 48-year-old married man, originally from Tonbridge in Kent, has been accused by Thailand&apos;s prime minister of being a long-time member of the anti-government redshirt movement and a key agitator in the riots which saw swaths of the capital burn last week. In his first prison interview since being arrested on Sunday, Savage, who has lived in Thailand for nine years, told the Guardian he was being fitted up for crimes he did not commit. He denied he was involved in burning down the Central World shopping centre in the heart of Bangkok&apos;s shopping district. &quot;I am being stitched up, being fitted up. I thought it was just for overstaying my visa, but now this is serious,&quot; Savage said from behind bars in Bangkok remand prison. &quot;They are trying to pin a whole lot of stuff on me, and a few others \u2026 that we had nothing to do with. We are being made scapegoats.&quot; Key in inspiring the allegations against Savage is a video shot during the chaotic final days of the redshirts&apos; protest, now circulating on YouTube. In it, he is seen dressed in a bandanna and carrying a stick, exhorting protesters to set fire to the shopping centre, in the middle of the reds&apos; protest site. &quot;We&apos;re gonna smash the fucking Central [World] plaza to shit. We&apos;re gonna steal everything out of it and burn the fucker down. Trust me, get pictures of that fucker.

Central World was the most serious fire. The seven-storey shopping centre, the largest in Thailand with more than a million square metres of retail space, was gutted and will be demolished. It remains a smouldering wreck in the middle of a city now slowly emerging from the bloodshed of last week. Government spokesman Panitan Wattanayagorn said this week a western man was seen inside Central World as the flames began to take hold: &quot;A white Westerner was involved in the arson attack on Central World, convincing them to set fire to it.&quot; Savage conceded he was in the video. &quot;I&apos;ll cut through the crap, it was definitely me. I said that,&quot; he said today. &quot;I was under stress when I said those things. I was emotional, I was wound up because I&apos;d been under sniper fire. I said it using old British sarcasm, I was being the caricature of the British soccer hooligan.&quot; He insisted he was not in the vicinity when the fire began. &quot;I had nothing to do with Central World burning down. Nothing at all. I swear. And I can prove it.&quot; Savage has admitted to being involved in earlier redshirt demonstrations, including riots in Pattaya in April 2009, when protesters stormed the hotel hosting the Asean leaders&apos; meeting, causing the conference to be abandoned. He was at state-owned TV station Channel 3 when it was set on fire last Wednesday, though he says he played no part in burning the building. Savage was arrested by immigration police at the weekend for overstaying his visa, but released. He was rearrested by Royal Thai Police on Sunday afternoon. The Thai government has said Savage would be charged with violating the state of emergency decree, an offence which carries a two-year prison sentence. But the prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, said today he was confident Savage was a long-term member of the redshirts, and further charges against him would be investigated. &quot;In the case of the Briton, he&apos;s involved with the [redshirt] movement in Pattaya.

Co-funded by Channel 4 and superb for the first two series, after which most of the original cast left for bigger, but not necessarily better, things. For two, Claudia Karvan and Joel Edgerton, that meant minor roles in the Star Wars prequels. Kath &amp; Kim (2002-present)            Rivalling Summer Heights High as Australia&apos;s funniest export, the cult sitcom Kath &amp; Kim is similarly deadpan and set in sun-kissed suburbia. The titular pair are bubble-permed divorcee Kath (Jane Turner) and spoilt daughter Kim (Gina Riley). Much of the mirth concerns the men in their life: Kath&apos;s &quot;hunk o&apos; spunk&quot; butcher fiancee Kel and Kim&apos;s estranged husband Brett, dad of their daughter Epponnee-Rae \u2013 played in flash forward by a certain Kylie Minogue. Barry Humphries, Matt Lucas and Shane Warne have also made cameos. It popularised the term &quot;muffin tops&quot; and the script is stuffed with such catchphrases: &quot;clacky mules&quot; (Kim&apos;s favoured footwear), &quot;total hornbag&quot; (any hottie), &quot;woine toime&quot; (the duo&apos;s daily gossip over a sundowner), &quot;Celine Cuisine&quot; (Celine Dion-endorsed slimmer&apos;s readymeals) and Kath telling Kim to &quot;look at moy&quot;. Honourable mentions Teen hormone explosion Heartbreak High, Nicole Kidman&apos;s breakout gig Bangkok Hilton, war weepie Anzacs, cult set-wobbler Prisoner Cell Block H and Skippy. We discounted The Thorn Birds for being a US production but feel free to make its case, hunky cleric fans.

Courtney Love&apos;s new-look Hole (minus Love herself) have just filed into the bar and are flopping into chairs; at reception the American songwriter Josh Ritter is holding a well-travelled guitar case and waiting for a taxi. Outside, three young women, also lugging guitars, are climbing into a people carrier. This scene is repeated, with different bands, most days at the K West, which is so popular with touring musicians it employs a &quot;music and entertainment sales director&quot; to look after them. Watching the people carrier pull away, Clara Saffer says: &quot;I think that&apos;s the Like.&quot; If anyone would know, she would \u2013 she&apos;s now the hotel&apos;s sales manager, but until recently occupied the music-and-entertainment post. The job consists of catering to rock stars&apos; whims, such as supplying 300 coat hangers on demand (she discreetly refuses to say who wanted them), and making sure they get a substantial discount on their bill \u2013 which matters when an average &quot;executive&quot; room costs \u00a3169 a night and there are upwards of 10 people in a touring party. One nameless high-rolling American artist booked 100 rooms for their stay. But even with special rates, that kind of expenditure suggests that while touring artists may be tightening the belt in other ways \u2013 flying economy rather than club, or reducing the number of personnel who accompany them on the road \u2013 they prefer not to scrimp where hotels are concerned, if possible. &quot;Some artists are just happy to have a decent roof over their heads, but others are very particular about where they stay,&quot; says Tina Waters of the Tour Company, a Glasgow-based music business travel agency. &quot;In a few cases, an advance party will inspect proposed hotels on a given tour in advance and compile a dossier of information prior to the final decision being made.&quot; Laborious as that sounds, it&apos;s understandable. Some acts spend more nights on the road than they do at home, so the quality of a hotel becomes paramount; a good one is guaranteed repeat business \u2013 which is why many hotels now offer &quot;entertainers&apos; rates&quot; \u2013 while bad ones become the stuff of legend, or even of song. In London, the K West has become the 21st-century equivalent of the Columbia \u2013 the Hyde Park pit-stop that was so rock&apos;n&apos;roll Oasis wrote a song about it. The stylish K West lacks the Columbia&apos;s battered glamour and sense of history, but then, bands&apos; expectations have changed since an unknown Noel Gallagher bunked down at the Columbia in the early 90s. The era of stars treating hotels as a combination of drug den, brothel and racecourse (Led Zeppelin&apos;s John Bonham once rode a motorbike down the corridor of Los Angeles&apos;s notorious Continental Hyatt House \u2013 one of the more printable Zep hotel stories) has been superseded by a much more businesslike attitude. These days, Saffer says, what your typical act wants is blackout curtains so they can sleep during the day, a late check-out (ditto) and somewhere safe to park the tour bus. They also appreciate little extras like a spa \u2013 Dizzee Rascal has used the K West&apos;s sauna. These facilities, plus its proximity to the offices of Universal and Sony Records, the BBC studios in White City and Heathrow airport, are the reason bands make up 25% of the hotel&apos;s business. Even the Hyatt House, now refurbished and renamed Andaz West Hollywood, has seen its musician clientele become more, well, grown-up. According to marketing manager Kim Okeson: &quot;These times are more like a corporate scenario than the sex-drugs-and-rock&apos;n&apos;roll days of the 60s, 70s and 80s.&quot; Her job is, of course, made manifestly easier when bands demand nothing more outrageous than to sleep in certain historically significant rooms. &quot;Most of our requests come from rockers who want to stay in the same room as Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, Ozzy Osbourne or Slash from when they stayed in the hotel in earlier years.&quot; Saffer struggles to recall any serious misbehaviour by musician guests in the last few years. Well, there was the band who booked a room to film a video: &quot;They were doing a snow scene and using those tiny polystyrene balls. I didn&apos;t know anything about it till they left, and we found the room completely covered in these little balls. They stick to everything \u2013 it took ages to clean up.&quot; Anything else? &quot;We&apos;ve found drugs around rooms, and someone put his foot\u00a0through a TV, but it&apos;s been a long time since I&apos;ve had a cleaner say, &apos;Come and look at this room.&apos; I used to have a lot of those.&quot; Polystyrene balls? If Bonham were still here, he would surely tell the artists of today they just aren&apos;t trying. In the hedonistic 60s and 70s, hotels were more than just a home away from home \u2013 they were places where musicians did things they wouldn&apos;t dare do at home, and throwing TVs out the window was practically de rigueur. In his 1974 book Billion Dollar Baby, Chicago Sun-Times writer Bob Greene&apos;s account of a month on the road with Alice Cooper, there&apos;s a pungent description of a wrecking spree instigated by drummer Neal Smith at a motel in upstate New York. After trashing several rooms, Smith ended the evening by toppling over a 7ft-high Coke vending machine. The damage came to $5,000 \u2013 a hefty whack in the early 70s. Why did grown men behave like that? Sometimes it was to let off steam after too many nights of gig/after-party/hotel, but often it was simply because \u2013 being young and rich \u2013 they could get away with it. Thirty years on, things have changed. With gigs generating more cash than album releases, there are more tours than ever before, but artists are under no illusion about what would happen if they knocked over a vending machine. Waters says: &quot;Managers, lawyers, accountants and other advisers seem to be more involved in the business these days, making artists think twice about the consequences of such behaviour.&quot; That&apos;s not to say appalling things no longer happen in the hotel after the show, but now they are likely to be followed swiftly by abject regret. &quot;I&apos;ve had a band throw a TV out of a hotel window in Birmingham because it was the classic rock&apos;n&apos;roll thing to do,&quot; says veteran tour manager Adam Lambert. The improbable miscreants? Busted, then at the height of their fame. &quot;A guy was touring with us to write a book about it, but it was a very civilised tour and it was suggested that it wouldn&apos;t be a very exciting book. A comment was made that nobody throws TVs out of the window any more, so Matt [Willis] threw the TV out the window. He felt incredibly guilty right afterward, and there were a lot of apologies. Nobody was\u00a0hurt, because we were only on the second floor. But those sort of things don&apos;t happen now, because the tour manager would be first to come down on [the bands] if they did.&quot; Because a touring artist can spend a large proportion of their waking hours in a hotel, the memory of a bad one lingers for years. Frankie Sandford of the Saturdays remembers a place in London that seemed nice enough at first. &quot;But as we walked down the corridor there was damp everywhere and wallpaper peeling off the walls. When we got into the room, the whole bathroom was green with mould, and we found a pube in the bed. We videoed it, so it&apos;s probably on YouTube somewhere.&quot; American R&amp;B heartthrob Jason Derulo has a story that, depending on your disgust threshold, is even worse. &quot;I was in a room in Wichita, Kansas, with a few of my friends. We were joking around and I happened to hit the wall. I didn&apos;t hit it hard, but the wall completely broke and there were bugs in it, little black roaches \u2013 there must&apos;ve been a nest in there. It was like something you&apos;d see in a bad dream.&quot; A good hotel, on the other hand, can make up for the sense of displacement and loneliness caused by being away from home. Sandford&apos;s bandmate, Rochelle Wiseman, says: &quot;When you&apos;re away and not wanting to be, it really helps to stay somewhere nice. We were out in Asia for a long time and we hadn&apos;t seen our families in London for ages, and I&apos;d been dreading the trip because I was already homesick. But we stayed in some beautiful hotels, like the Shangri-La in Bangkok, and it really made a difference. There was a lot to do in them to take your mind off things.&quot; The onus is on travel agents and tour managers to make the right choices when booking accommodation. Bands have riders with special requests \u2013 such as Joss Stone&apos;s for a room that doesn&apos;t face the main road and Keane&apos;s for pillows without feathers (one of the trio is allergic) \u2013 and if standards fall short, the tour manager gets the blame. He or she is also responsible for deciding \u2013 in the case of bands with especially fervent followings \u2013 what level of security is needed at the hotel. Keane are particularly popular in South America, and hotel arrangements there present a challenge. Their longtime tour manager, Colin Davies, says: &quot;Last time we were in Argentina there were 100 fans camped outside the hotel the whole time we were there, so our security liaised with hotel security to make sure there was a level of safety for band. We kept an eye on the elevator, checked where routes in and out were and the band members checked in under aliases. It&apos;s a privacy thing, because fans will go to any length to speak to the band.&quot; At the Andaz, fans wouldn&apos;t be allowed to walk off the street to the lifts anyway, says Okeson: &quot;If your elevators aren&apos;t locked off from the general public, then you must not have many rock stars or celebs that stay at the hotel.&quot; But Lambert, who mainly works with chart-pop acts such as JLS, sighs as he explains how\u00a0easy it is for fans to breach hotel security. &quot;What&apos;s really difficult is if fans are staying in the hotel themselves. They book online and use a credit card, and then you&apos;ll have groups of them there, roaming around the corridors. Or they get into a lift and see where you get off. And once they find out what room you&apos;re in, you don&apos;t get a minute&apos;s sleep.&quot; Not sleeping would have been less of a problem decades ago, when partying all night was a badge of honour. Today, not only do artists insist on getting their eight hours, they expect hotels to make sure they do. &quot;There was one artist whose PA didn&apos;t want the oversheet tucked in,&quot; says Saffer tolerantly. &quot;They couldn&apos;t sleep if they felt restricted.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-06-03T21:00:31Z", "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Pop and rock", "Metal", "Led Zeppelin", "Hotels"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jun/03/rock-stars-hotels-caroline-sullivan", "title": "Why don't rock stars trash hotel rooms anymore?", "sentences": ["But we stayed in some beautiful hotels, like the Shangri-La in Bangkok, and it really made a difference."]}, {"article": "In Los Angeles, a white-faced, soft-featured man nobody remembers very clearly sits in his room and keeps avid track of the movements of Martin Luther King. Meanwhile, far away in South Carolina, the world&apos;s most renowned civil rights leader plans his next campaign: for a Poor People&apos;s Army to march on Washington, setting poverty alongside racism as imperatives for reform. And then Eric Starvo Galt packs his bags, quits LA, and begins a long, winding, brooding drive \u2013 to Alabama, Georgia, and Memphis, Tennessee, where, with a single shot from a flop-house bathroom window, he will assassinate King. Hampton Sides&apos;s technique gives history a fictional sheen. He follows Shelby Foote in &quot;employing the novelist&apos;s methods without his licence&quot;. Every incident in this compelling account of King&apos;s stalking and slaying during America&apos;s annus horribilis \u2013 1968 \u2013 has a factual reference to back it up; every detail aspires to truth. Yet, Galt himself seems to inhabit the half-world of the best-selling paperback thriller. One of the books he leaves behind him on his travels is The 9th Directive, Adam Hall&apos;s Quiller tale of Bangkok political assassins. And though Sides takes his title from Robert Johnson \u2013 &quot;There&apos;s a hellhound on my trail&quot; \u2013 he might just as easily have called it The Day of the Demented Jackal. Like Frederick Forsyth&apos;s Jackal, out to kill De Gaulle, Galt changes names from state to state and boarding house to boarding house. He could be Paul Bridgeman, John Willard, Harvey Lowmeyer, Ramon Sneyd, a gamut of aliases as he ducks and weaves. In fact, he&apos;s not even Galt, but James Earl Ray, a petty criminal escaped from the state penitentiary in Jefferson City, Missouri. Why Starvo? Perhaps because it&apos;s a riff on Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the demonic Bond villain. Why is he so infernally difficult to catch? Perhaps because he a master of disguise (and plastic surgery to boot). Some big players in Sides&apos;s account have nothing remotely fictional about them. Not J Edgar Hoover, chomping in his FBI office against that &quot;tom cat with obsessive degenerate sexual urges&quot;, Martin Luther King. Not King himself, a Nobel laureate feted by presidents and Hollywood, but now tired and fearful as the wilder men of black power seize influence and cast his doctrines of non-violence aside. Not Lyndon Johnson, beset by Vietnam and an America fracturing before him. But James Earl Ray \u2013 as Sides only begins to call him once his true identity is known \u2013 is, and remains, a mistier, profoundly ambiguous figure. On the one hand, he&apos;s a simple bigot, working for George Wallace&apos;s election campaign in California, spilling racist bile over beers in the cat houses where he goes to buy sex. On the other hand, lying low, keeping way under Hoover&apos;s radar, escaping to London and Portugal and only trapped in the end at Heathrow because he&apos;s run out of alternative passports and money, he&apos;s a canny operator, the smartest son of a dirt-poor, utterly dysfunctional Missouri family. He reads, he ponders, he thinks. Maybe, then, like Forsyth&apos;s Jackal, he was not the loner that he seems? Maybe he was hired by one of the rich fanatics \u2013 Sides names names \u2013 who loathed Martin Luther King and wanted him gone, by any means? But here&apos;s where history draws a line and the would-be novelist stops short. Fiction in Forsyth mode would typecast Ray as a paid assassin. After all, he had wads of mysterious cash. He often seems too shrewd to play random nut. He escapes from prison not once, but twice. Yet there&apos;s no conclusive evidence either way. Hamton Sides doesn&apos;t know Ray&apos;s final motivation and so must leave it blank. That&apos;s a defect in some respects. We are told so much about him \u2013 what he drinks, where he travels, how he reacts under pressure \u2013 but the &quot;why&quot; of it all remains unanswered. What&apos;s clearer, and fascinating even at this distance, is the FBI hunt that tracks him down as soon as a snarling Hoover is ordered to find the killer of the freedom fighter he so manifestly despises. A moment&apos;s tapping on a police computer keyboard might run Ray to earth today. Three decades back, even when the suspect list had been whittled down, it took 53,000 fingerprint examinations to identify the man who wasn&apos;t called Eric Galt after all. One thumbprint finally takes the FBI to Jefferson City penitentiary. Three thousand agents have to go hunting the slow way, interviewing, checking, pounding pavements in pursuit of every possible lead. It&apos;s a prodigious effort in time and cost ($2m spent). But at last Chief Superintendent Tommy Butler of the Yard picks up the trail as Ray tries to catch a plane to Brussels (and thence to Rhodesia, where he dreams of serving Ian Smith). There are some problems with Sides&apos;s fact clad as fiction. Often we get aggregation, not investigation: too many meaningless details piled one on top of the other like an old Sunday Times &quot;Insight&quot; story run riot. Whole paragraphs are spent lugubriously pointing out where Sides thinks he may have extrapolated a tad too far. (&quot;What Eric Galt did inside room 5B between five o&apos;clock and a little before six is not precisely known... Perhaps he listened to the news on his Channel Master pocket radio or mashed a bead of Brylcreem onto his fingertips and worked the unguent through his freshly cut hair&quot;). But, most of the time, the narrative races along, a deadly road trip heading to a disastrous conclusion. You don&apos;t learn much that is fresh about the exhausted enigma of Martin Luther King here. He&apos;s a victim in waiting, not a central character. But you do get a good sense of those around him \u2013 loyal, plodding Ralph Abernathy; slick, scheming Jesse Jackson; Senator Georgia Davis, his Tennessee squeeze \u2013 and the sheer chaos of a brave cause losing focus. Above all, you get a great sense of a dislocated, flailing time in modern history when thousands cheered King&apos;s killing and made Ray their hero, of an America where rage and hate threatened to derail a nation. Times past? You can debate that, perhaps, while the Tea Party serves Earl Grey and blueberry muffins. But, in a macabre way, James Earl Ray still shadows the stage. He makes no sense. We cannot explain him. And so we can&apos;t say that his jackal spirit is truly dead.", "publicationDate": "2010-06-05T23:04:46Z", "tags": ["History", "Books", "Culture", "Martin Luther King", "Frederick Forsyth"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/06/hellbound-trail-hampton-sides", "title": "Hellhound on his Trail by Hampton Sides | Book review", "sentences": ["One of the books he leaves behind him on his travels is The 9th Directive, Adam Hall&apos;s Quiller tale of Bangkok political assassins."]}, {"article": "The widow of David Carradine, the Kill Bill actor who was found dead in a Bangkok hotel room last June, is seeking damages from the company behind his final film, Stretch.

I saw a young man&apos;s body being peeled off the road. The police did not clean up before letting traffic flow again, so I drove queasily through the remaining blood and brains and was haunted onto the flight to Bangkok. Judging by the mess, both he and the truck that hit him were travelling at high speed. That it was early afternoon did not preclude either him or the driver of the truck from being drunk. He was one of an estimated 1.7 million annual road fatalities, 70-90% of which happen in the global south. Ironically, road fatalities and the noxious clouds of industrial and hydrocarbon emissions from vehicles could be thought of as a success in development terms, indicating increased wealth. The problem is that we seem to be in perpetual catching-up mode to fix the ailments that go with success. The World Bank admitted that:  Road crashes cost approximately 1 to 3% of a country&apos;s annual GNP \u2026 developing countries currently lose in the region of $100bn every year \u2026 almost twice as much as \u2026 total development assistance received worldwide.  Despite Harvard and the World Health Organisation (WHO) both insisting that road and occupational accidents look to outstrip infectious disease as the major causes of death and disability in the south, there is little evidence that donor agencies have shifted their priorities accordingly. Trauma medicine and rehabilitation centres remain rarities. Road and occupational deaths remain like wallpaper on the modernisation agenda: striking when first noticed, then increasingly invisible. But figures can only be indicative. Lao colleagues told me that for cultural and financial reasons, corpses are often taken away by families and cremated, the death not reported. When I arrived in 2004, the number of motorcycles was beginning to exceed China-made Hare bicycles immortalised by Dervla Murphy. Hares may have been better value than Chinese motorbikes, which street talk asserts have unreliable lights and brakes, but are affordable. An acquaintance&apos;s $600 motorbike had her repeatedly borrowing my tools as various parts failed, and her collection of scars increased. In many parts of Asia, vehicle-testing standards are non-existent. The Chinese-built Chery cars, found by the Russians to be &quot;unsafe at any speed&quot; (a claim the manufacturer denied) is the colourful choice among Vientiane&apos;s successful women before they upgrade to something with more \u00e9lan. Visiting experts advocate rational and linear solutions. But in Asia, the cause and effect relationship is often non-rational. A Thai or Lao surviving a crash is more likely to erect a spirit house than reflect on the use of wing mirrors, or make merit at the temple rather than look before entering a stream of traffic. Passers-by may be reluctant to help a bleeding victim in case they &quot;catch the lousy luck&quot;. These are factors that cannot be changed simply with asphalted roads or traffic lights. And infrastructure solutions, such as the new poorly designed major arterial through Vientiane, may actually raise accident rates by enabling greater speed. Systematic corruption, such as enabling a proxy to buy a driving licence, undermines progress. New wealth also enables new drivers to drive powerful cars such as a Maserati (along with Humvees, and Mercedes sports, which are increasingly popular) they are ill-equipped to handle. Posh cars driving under the Asian Brown Cloud, a toxic haze that can be easily seen dozing over most of south and south-east Asia, may be how people will come to think of Asia in the future. This murky mix of combustion products, vehicle and industrial emissions, can easily be seen from an aircraft, and is responsible for spiralling respiratory deaths in most Asian countries. It drove me out of Jakarta. Valleys like that of Chiang Mai and Katmandu fill with diesel fumes and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and held in by seasonal temperature inversion layers. Some cities such as Manila are trying their best to tackle the problem with emissions testing and new electric jeepneys. But China&apos;s spectacular addiction to cars is corroding any headway made by other nations. The Asian Brown Cloud also contributes to localised climate changes by reducing photosynthesis, drastically effecting food production for Asia&apos;s expanding populations. Recent studies indicate that stormwater run off from roads carries toxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from truck and car exhausts, as well as heavy metals such as lead and zinc into waterways. Up to 4kg of zinc can be found in large truck tyres \u2013 and released when friction hits the road. Runoff finds it way into water courses and contaminates fish. In Asia, the poor are dependent on fish as the primary source of dietary protein. The implications should be apparent. I used to regularly encounter a handsome but severely brain-damaged young man on my morning Mekong walks. The victim of a crash, he was severely disabled. I have not seen him for months.

As part of this inner security force, the Sar-Allah, or Avengers of God, he was also responsible, he says, for the leaders&apos; personal safety during the protests after the presidential elections, which were widely viewed as having been stolen by Ahmadinejad. He witnessed increasing dissent within the guards. &quot;We have Revolutionary Guards who defied orders, though they were severely punished, expelled from the force and taken to prison,&quot; he says. Torkaman, 24, is in hiding in a small, nondescript flat in a backwater in central Turkey, where he is seeking asylum with his wife and two-year-old son. His extraordinary account of the depravities of the Iranian government and its crushing of dissent forms the backbone of a film by Guardian Films and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. The film features the testimony of four former Revolutionary Guards, and reveals the extent of the disillusionment and division within the ranks. Most significantly, perhaps, it provides evidence that sections of the Revolutionary Guard \u2013 a core part of the regime, which controls both the nuclear programme and huge swaths of the economy \u2013 are angry with the very leaders they have been traditionally prepared to die for. Iran&apos;s ban on foreign journalists makes it difficult to verify Torkaman&apos;s claims of defections and resignations from the Revolutionary Guards in the face of the Iranian government&apos;s &quot;reign of terror against its own people&quot;. But his description of the brutal mechanics of the regime, and the impact of recent repression on the guards, fits with reports that have come out of the country since the election. Torkaman admits playing a part in crushing the opposition in the aftermath of the contested election, but he says that he could no longer live with it and fled for Turkey in January. &quot;I want people outside to know what is happening and what this regime is doing to them \u2013 this has to start from somewhere,&quot; he says. Despite the regime&apos;s description of the country as an Islamic republic, &quot;God does not exist in Iran right now&quot;. Fearful for his safety, he believes Iranian intelligence is tracking his movements. &quot;Please no filming outside the flat,&quot; he says. &quot;It is too dangerous.&quot; What Torkaman alleges about the levels of dissent within the guards raises questions about their loyalty to both the president and, perhaps more importantly, the supreme leader. He says the doubts among the once-loyal foot soldiers have been exacerbated by the brutal way in which all forms of opposition have been attacked by an increasingly paranoid regime. &quot;Because of my job every five days I would meet with high-ranking officials, like Mr Ahmadinejad and even his ministers. These meetings were mostly with leaders&apos; security commanders. But gradually the distance got less and less and we would meet with him everyday. \u2026 I could see the fear in them \u2026 &quot;The fear and panic was quite evident in them, in their actions, their demeanour and various dismissals and appointments. It was quite obvious, as they were appointing people to the powerful positions who are their supporters.&quot; The scale of the danger posed by the so-called green rebels was underlined today when the leader of the Revolutionary Guards described the protests as a bigger threat to the republic than the 1980s war with Iraq. Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari said: &quot;Although last year&apos;s sedition did not last more than around eight months, it was much more dangerous than the imposed war which Saddam began against us.&quot; According to Torkaman, the leadership was so worried that Khamenei and Ahmadinejad had a plane on standby, ready to fly them to Syria. Khamenei is so paranoid, he says, that he has lost confidence in his own security team and has installed his own intelligence unit behind his office with bugging and surveillance equipment that allows his office to spy on their own spies. He is also rumoured to change his bodyguards daily because of a fear of assassination. The guard&apos;s founding principles of defending the achievements of the 1979 Islamic Revolution have, says Torkaman, been &quot;betrayed&quot; by a regime that has carried out a brutal repression of the Iranian opposition, including the widespread use of public executions and extrajudicial killings, rape of both men and women, and a cover-up of the true numbers killed during the protests. But although internal discord within the guards is growing, he says, this does not mean that the regime is about to be overthrown: &quot;Yes, there is a rift, but I have to add an explanation. If there is any danger of the regime being overthrown then all the sectors will actually unite against that \u2026 because their existence depends on this regime.&quot; As discord grows, the regime is said to be filling the guards&apos; ranks with thousands of young, pliant recruits from the countryside, whose loyalties are to the modern Iranian state rather than the ideals of the 1979 revolution. A former guard, Major Mohamad Reza Madhi, who fled Iran two years ago, believes there is now a policy to purge older guards, those most likely to question the motives of the regime. At a high security compound in Bangkok, Madhi tells Guardian Films that he is in constant communication with former colleagues, monitoring events via the internet. He gasps for breath when he speaks \u2013 the result of five chemical weapons attacks during more than seven years in the trenches of the Iran-Iraq war. &quot;If the veteran members of the Revolutionary Guard criticise the practices saying this is against Islam \u2026 they are given early retirement or stopped from working,&quot; he says. According to Mahdi, the new breed of recruits follow orders without question. &quot;The majority \u2026 have no idea of right or wrong \u2013 what is legal what is not. They bring these young men in \u2026 and they hand them weapons and these young people commit acts of murder.&quot; It is no surprise that the guards find it easy to take on new recruits, because the corps has connections in all parts of Iran&apos;s most important institutions. Described as a &quot;conglomerate with guns&quot;, they have their own naval and missile units, while the al-Qods (Jerusalem) force combines the functions of an intelligence service, SAS-type special forces and an aid agency. The guards&apos; holding companies and charitable foundations have a stake in construction, energy and telecommunications, and its control over Gulf ports and airport terminals allows it to move commodities without paying duty. Madhi&apos;s claims of division in the ranks are supported by the testimony of another former Revolutionary Guard, who worked for al-Qods, and who would speak to the Guardian only on the condition of anonymity. He claims that small groups meet secretly \u2013 using the internet to maintain contact \u2013 to plan how to help the opposition. He cites the increased levels and more brutal forms of torture as one of the reasons for turning against the government. In his particular case, he says he was deeply affected by the hanging he witnessed of a pregnant woman. &quot;Whatever crime she was guilty with, you cannot hang her if she is pregnant. This is against Islam. Not acceptable,&quot; he says. &quot;They kept her shivering in the air for like 15 minutes until she died. She was bleeding in front of her children. This regime will not last for long.&quot; These descriptions match those of a former guard who was smuggled into Turkey three weeks ago. Now in hiding, with his wife and child still in Iran, he was also only prepared to talk anonymously. Going under the name Ali, he explains that he was arrested after refusing to beat protesters but was released after spending two months in prison when family members intervened. &quot;My sisters and brothers-in-law are agents of the regime and among the senior officials of the Ministry of Intelligence,&quot; he says. &quot;My wife managed to find out where I was through her brother and then she bribed the commander of that district.&quot; Ali describes the torture he was subjected to as routine for the regime. &quot;The worst method \u2026 was the mock execution and I don&apos;t think there is any torture more horrific than that. They would convince us that this is the end of us. &quot;They would put me on the electric chair and everything was ready. They would tie my hands and feet, they would connect the cables, everything was done with the exception of pressing the button to apply the electric shock. &quot;Special guards began to surround and attack me, my brother and a friend with pepper gas, baton, chains, knives \u2013 they moved us into a corner and that is how we became their captives.&quot; Ali escaped capture, but his brother&apos;s ID had been seized \u2013 and he knew Iranian forces would soon come searching for him. &quot;I was in hiding until they put pressure on my wife and threatened that if I did not hand myself in, they would arrest her instead. After a period of five or six months I don&apos;t remember exactly, I was forced to return home.&quot; Just half an hour after Ali returned to his house, security forces came to arrest him. His head was put into a sack, before being bundled into the boot of a car and driven to a safe house where he was held for two months. &quot;During the day my blindfolds were removed for a maximum of half an hour or less, it was a small place, it was tiled throughout, so it was easy to clean, because there was constantly bleeding and blood stains, they used to torture people there.&quot; Ali describes in detail how he was tortured daily: &quot;I was kicked for three to four hours a day. With a whip, cable, wooden stick. One could constantly hear the shouting and the screams from other detainees.&quot; Ali was subjected to a series of mock executions, which he describes as the worst kind of torture. &quot;Once it was by hanging another time it was by firing squad and another time by hanging us from the scaffold \u2013 all of these would be mock executions \u2013 to be honest there was no difference between a real execution and a mock execution. The only difference was that I realised I could still breath. In effect I was a walking dead.&quot; Ali said the torturers showed little sign of remorse. &quot;I could not see their faces, I could only hear their voices and suffer their torture. I imagined that they were not even human. &quot;You cannot even call them animals since even animals follow certain discipline. They did it with so much excitement and I don&apos;t know, I cannot compare it to anything.&quot; Ali fled to Turkey last month \u2013 since then he has not been able to contact his wife. She was pregnant before he was arrested but suffered a miscarriage. Ali believes it was a result of the interrogations and the beatings meted out by Iranian officers. &quot;I consider the regime and its agents to be responsible for this. I am prepared to give my life for this.&quot; The Bureau of Investigative Journalism is a not-for-profit foundation based at City University in London ", "publicationDate": "2010-06-11T04:00:02Z", "tags": ["Iran", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/11/iran-election-revolutionary-guard", "title": "Iran's Revolutionary Guards point to fresh dissent within oppressive regime", "sentences": ["At a high security compound in Bangkok, Madhi tells Guardian Films that he is in constant communication with former colleagues, monitoring events via the internet."]}, {"article": "Muhammed Hussein Torkaman     Muhammed Hussein Torkaman.

An FCO spokesman says: &quot;Laws and customs can differ between countries, and specific detail in these laws can change, so we advise parents of young people travelling for the first time to check with the country&apos;s embassy in the UK before booking. For example, Spanish law defines under-18s as minors and subject to parental control or adult supervision. Any unaccompanied minors that come to the attention of the Spanish local authorities (because of, say, criminal incidents or admission to hospital) are deemed to be vulnerable under the law and face being taken into a minors&apos; centre for their protection until their situation is resolved and a parent or suitable guardian can be found. And under-18s travelling to Portugal must have travel authorisation from their parents or guardian, authenticated at the Portuguese embassy or consulate in the UK in advance. They may also be refused entry if they can&apos;t prove they have someone in Portugal taking responsibility for them during their stay. The UK Identity and Passport service says 15,000 Britons under 25 lost their passport on holiday last year, so keep an eye on it! Make two photocopies and give one to a mate. You also need travel insurance. The Association of British Insurers says there are policies specifically for under 18s, (try insuremore.co.uk or essentialtravel.co.uk). You might be covered under your parents&apos; policy even if not travelling with them, though this may require you to be named on it, or that you travel for a maximum of 21 days. Flights &quot;It&apos;s up to the airline what its rule is on unaccompanied minors. There is no aviation legislation about this, and the minimum accepted ages vary,&quot; says James Fremantle, spokesman for the Air Transport Users&apos; Council &quot;Most airlines will accept those aged 15 and over, but have to supply a member of staff to accompany minors on and off the flight, and as the airline covers the cost, some low-cost airlines will not accept young passengers for that reason. Those that do, do not usually pass on a surcharge to the customer.&quot; Many airlines insist that parents accompany under-18s to check in and passport control. British Airways allows anyone over 12 to travel as an adult. Younger children must be accompanied by a person 16 or over, or register with the airline&apos;s Skyflyer Solo service, at a cost of \u00a335 per leg for short-haul, \u00a350 for long-haul. Children aged 12-16 can also apply for the service if they want someone to accompany them through the airport. See britishairways.com/travel/childinfo/public/en_gb for more information. Ryanair doesn&apos;t carry unaccompanied minors under 16. Easyjet does not accept unaccompanied minors under 14; those aged 14-15 must be accompanied by someone 16 or over. Independent travelling Whether you choose one city to explore, or an area of a country, travelling independently is a surefire route to maturity and adventure. Patrick Kingsley, Guardian student journalist of the year 2009, said: &quot;When I was 16, a friend and I spent a week running round Istanbul, and the next summer another chum and I spent a month hiking and taking buses from Krakow, Poland, to Lviv in Ukraine. &quot;Both trips were self-organised: I just booked flights and Googled &apos;cheap hostels&apos;, and bought maps to plan routes in advance. Some parents might balk at these trips, but we felt safe \u2013 mum and dad were only an (expensive) mobile call away. In fact, there were two occasions where we were stumbling around in a Polish forest late at night, utterly lost, and my father and brother were able to direct us over the phone towards civilisation using Google Maps.&quot;  Hostelbookers.com, which collates hostels all over the world, says there is a vast range that accept those over 16; probably your best bet as Teletext Holidays says many hotels won&apos;t accept bookings from under-18s \u2013 or under-21s in America. It&apos;s easy to plan a route on public transport. &quot;Rather than opting for a fortnight in the Costas, taking a trip by train to a few cities will give you a taste for adventure and introduce you to the joys of travelling slowly,&quot; says Tom Hall of Lonely Planet. &quot;My first overseas jaunt without parents was with my brother. We made our way overland to Rome.&quot; See seat61.com for global rail routes and links to sites selling rail tickets; and interrailnet.com for InterRail passes for discounts on European rail. Long-haul adventure holidays &quot;We find that lots of young people want to travel before they embark on the pressures of A-levels, and this can be a good time to start experiencing all the world has to offer,&quot; says Emma Mitchell of STA Travel (0871 230 0040. &quot;Pre sixth-form people often opt for south-east Asia or Australia. Australia&apos;s sunshine and English language mean it&apos;s an appealing, safe option, whereas those wanting to push their boundaries love south-east Asia because culturally it&apos;s so different.&quot; There are plenty of group tours available to people of pre-A-level age, which allow them freedom but with a safety net to fall back on. You travel with a mix of people aged from 16 into their 20s. The Oz Experience tour (+61 2 9213 1766) uses a &quot;hop-on-hop-off&quot; bus on different routes, where the drivers double up as tour guides who book hotels and teach people about local culture and wildlife. It costs from \u00a3306pp for 21 days, including accommodation. Flights to Sydney available to students start from \u00a3605 return. Flights to Perth start from \u00a3615. A 30-day Indo-China Discovery tour with STA Travel costs from \u00a31,319pp for a small group trip starting and ending in Bangkok, with potential add-ons including Fiji. Flights to Bangkok available to students cost from \u00a3379 return. Language exchanges  &quot;The best gap projects or long summer trips for 16-17-year-olds are through friends and familyoverseas,&quot; says Tom Griffiths of gapyear.com. &quot;So seek out those long-lost relatives in Italy, Spain or wherever, or someone the same age who might be up for an exchange, as long as your parents are happy to host their child for a few weeks.&quot; You could start by finding a pen pal, perhaps at penpalworld.com or penpalparty.com. Longer stints, including gap years, normally involve a family friend with a business overseas who can give the teenager a work experience/live-abroad placement. These are very good for workplace practice, language skills and your CV. &quot;After I finished my GCSEs, aged 16,&quot; says Tom, &quot;I spent the summer in France, staying with my mum&apos;s French exchange student&apos;s daughter. The plan was for me to become fluent in French to help me with my French A-level \u2013 which it did. I travelled down to Toulouse and all the way back to the UK by myself. It gave my parents nightmares, but it gave me an incredible life experience and the hunger for further travel. This type of activity is not only safe, but fun and beneficial \u2013 as after eight weeks speaking only French/German/Spanish, you&apos;re almost guaranteed an A in speaking tests and you&apos;ll probably go up a grade or two overall.&quot; Accompanying school, youth club or church summer trips overseas is another option: 16-17-year-olds act as &quot;older assistants&quot; for younger kids. Package holidays &quot;With teenagers there is one overriding principle, and that is that a contract cannot be enforceable with a minor,&quot; said a spokesperson from the Association of British Travel Agents. &quot;So some companies insist on a party member being over 18 while others require parental permission.&quot; Thomas Cook lets 16- and 17-year-olds book some of its trips, depending on the brand. &quot;In general, for parties that are under 18, written authority is required from a parent or legal guardian, who must sign the booking form in the presence of one of our sales consultants,&quot; said a spokeswoman. &quot;The consultant may ask the parent/guardian to produce a copy of their passport showing their name and signature to prove their identity.&quot; One of its most famous brands, Club 18-30 (0871 895 0066), actually accepts travellers from 17 (up to 35), though under-18s must get a parent or guardian to sign the booking form in the presence of a travel agent, and must book in a travel agent&apos;s office, not online or by phone. Destinations are still the party favourites \u2013 Ibiza, Mallorca, Crete, but also Bulgaria&apos;s Sunny Beach resort on the Black Sea, and Marmaris in Turkey. Prices can be ridiculously cheap: seven nights in a basic apartment in San Antonio, Ibiza, departing on 26 June costs \u00a3249pp, including flights. Thomson and First Choice holidays, including their youth brands, Freestyle (for trips to Egypt, Mexico, Spain, Greece) and 2wenties (European party destinations), are stricter, and insist the lead member of the group is over 18, to be responsible for the rest of the group, who must all be 17 or over. Lads Holiday (08445 889 998) sells trips from various operators to top European party resorts \u2013 Zante, Ayia Napa, Tenerife \u2013 and takes anyone over 16. Malia in Crete is its most popular summer destination, with July packages from \u00a3299 including flights. A week from 20 August at Magaluf&apos;s Mallorca Rocks Hotel costs \u00a3339, including flights. UK holidays  Camping  &quot;Finding a campsite that will take groups of under-18s, and single-sex groups, is a real problem for young people,&quot; says Casey Mead, spokeswoman for camping website pitchup.com, which has just added a list of those that do. Search under &quot;student friendly&quot; . You could always wildcamp too, legal in Scotland. Several campsites in the UK cater specifically for young groups wanting to let their hair down. One of the most popular destinations is Cornwall, particularly Newquay. Group holiday specialist newquayuncovered.co.uk says the ones to head for are Trevelgue Holiday Park and Smugglers Haven, whose Exodus programme for 16-17-year-olds arranges under-18s club nights in conjunction with local youth services. It also lists hotels and self-catering accommodation that cater for young groups. However, Cornwall&apos;s tourist board says the resorts&apos; popularity has caused problems with underage drinking, and it is trying to discourage under-18s from holidaying there unaccompanied. The Newquay police are cracking down on underage drinking this summer, patrolling trains, confiscating alcohol and informing underage drinkers&apos; parents if they are caught. Youth hostelling  Before there were such things as 18-30 holidays, youth hostelling was what many a fresh-faced youngster did for their first parent-free break. YHA (01629 592700) accepts those aged 16 or over, and has hostels all over the UK. You could hike between a few; the Lake District or Scotland are good places for this. Or why not learn some skills and meet people at the same time by booking one of the hill and mountain courses the YHA runs, such as peak walking for those aged 16 plus in the Peak District (\u00a3106 for two nights), National Navigation Award Scheme trips to qualify in map reading and compass use (\u00a3141 for two nights), or various summer camps (see overleaf). UK festivals      Underage festival in Victoria Park, London    You can&apos;t beat a summer festival with your mates for unlimited fun, but you need to find one that lets in under-18s \u2013 most of the big ones insist they are accompanied by an adult. The Wickerman festival (23-24 July, Kirkcudbright, Scotland, Goldie Lookin Chain, 808 State) takes unaccompanied under-16s. Lounge on the Farm (loungeonthefarm.co.uk/ 9-11 July, Merton Farm, Canterbury, Hercules and Love Affair, Tunng, Beardyman) gets a big teen crowd, with weekend tickets for 13-17-year-olds costing \u00a375. Camp Bestival (30 July-1 August, Dorset, \u00a377.50 for 11-17s) lets youngsters in and hosts special under-18s parties called Let&apos;s Go Crazy, as well as this year&apos;s acts, Calvin Harris, Chipmunk, Friendly Fires and more. It&apos;s only a one-day event, but the Underage festival in Tower Hamlets, east London on 1 August, tickets \u00a329.50) is for 14-18-year-olds only and doesn&apos;t let anyone older in. Acts this year include Lightspeed Champion, MIA, Ellie Goulding and New Young Pony Club. Adventures at sea  Tall Ships Adventures (02392 832055) offers voyages on amazing boats aimed at 16-25-year-olds. Clyde MacFarlane, Guardian student travel writer of the year 2009, says: &quot;When I was 16, I took part in a tall ship race across the Baltic, from Gdynia in Poland to Turku in Finland. It&apos;s not exactly a holiday \u2013 you have to take it in turns to be on watch through the night. Learning a few basic knots on deck may sound easy, but putting them into practice when 45m up the mast is a very different story.&quot; This year the race is in the North Sea, with seven-, 10- and 12-day legs between Belgium, Denmark and Norway, from late July to early August. Prices range from \u00a3699 to \u00a3899, including all accommodation, meals, safety equipment and instructions. UK volunteering     A working holiday with the National Trust.

One of the best is National Trust Working Holidays (0844 800 3099), which accepts over-16s. &quot;Groups are usually made up of a dozen volunteers, of varying ages, and they are sociable experiences&quot;, says Alison Dalby, press officer for the National Trust. Some of this year&apos;s trips include a photographic survey holiday at Hardcastle Crags in the south Pennines (10-17 July, \u00a3125), running an outdoor play week for kids in August at Gibside landscaped gardens in the north-east (\u00a3105), and fencing, footpath clearing and beach cleaning at the Penrose estate in Cornwall (July, \u00a3105).

Summer camps  If you&apos;re looking for something more structured, where you&apos;re guaranteed to develop new skills and knowledge, and meet people the same age, a summer camp isn&apos;t necessarily a dorky option. Many are lots of fun. For example \u2013 the YHA&apos;s Doit4real.co.uk has 23 camps for ages 10-19 (with separate camps for different age ranges) offering four days of activities such as quad biking, paintballing, film making and street dancing, with prices from \u00a379-299. You can also try a team leader camp, for 17- 19-year-olds, to develop leadership skills (whether you want to boss about young siblings or become a chief exec). Also check out campbeaumont.co.uk for three-, four- or seven-day multi-activity camps; summerdrama.co.uk for acting, mime and dance camps in Northern Ireland; and pgl.co.uk for surfing, film making and learner-driver camps. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 June 2010.

The global retail giant, which trades as Tesco Lotus in Thailand, has withdrawn a libel writ against Kamol Kamoltrakul, a Bangkok Business News commentator. It was served after he criticised the company&apos;s expansion, which he claimed had hurt local businesses. His case, and that of two other Thai journalists who had been sued by Tesco Lotus, became a cause celebre after writers, including Nick Hornby, Deborah Moggach and Marina Lewycka, expressed concern over the company&apos;s &quot;disproportionate response&quot;. Kamol said today he was relieved the case had been dropped. He said he believed Tesco&apos;s legal action, rather than being a defence of its business, was an attempt to silence his criticism. &quot;They have used their power and influence to stop me [writing my column],&quot; he said. Kamol, a government adviser on banking and a visiting lecturer at three universities, argued that Thailand should regulate the expansion of foreign businesses. He conceded he had made an error in one calculation, inflating Tesco&apos;s income in Thailand by a factor of 10 \u2013 he said it generated 37% of its revenue from Thailand; the true figure is 3.7%. But he said of his fundamental argument: &quot;I think I&apos;m right.&quot; The presence of multinational supermarket chains in Thailand is a topic of fierce debate across the country. Critics argue that small retailers cannot compete with the major chains and are gradually squeezed out of the market. The case against Kamol was abandoned last July, but he did not discover this &quot;until about two months ago&quot;. In a statement, Tesco in the UK said: &quot;In July 2009, the case against Mr Kamol was withdrawn after we were informed that he was unwell.&quot; Kamol was suffering from lymphoma but has since recovered. Other Thai journalists pursued by Tesco included Bangkok Business News columnist Nongnart Harnvilai. She wrote that Tesco didn&apos;t &quot;love&quot; Thailand, for which the retailer sought \u00a31.6m in damages. The case was settled after an apology was published. Former MP Jit Siratranont was sued for defamation for \u00a316.4m after he described Tesco&apos;s push into the Thai market as &quot;aggressive&quot; in a speech. In dismissing the libel case and the damages claim against Jit, Thailand&apos;s supreme court ruled the criticism was made &quot;in good faith by way of fair comment on any person or thing subjected to public criticism&quot;. Tesco Lotus has been in Thailand since 1998, and has 614 stores, employing 38,000 staff. A spokesman said: &quot;The case against Ms Nongnart was settled 18 months ago, with the publication of an apology in January 2009. The case against Mr Jit followed a sustained campaign of deliberate misinformation \u2026 Again almost a year ago, in July 2009, we lodged an appeal in the Jit case. This followed a judgement that was made against Tesco without us being given the opportunity to provide any evidence at all. Again, we would like to settle this matter on the basis of a simple apology.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-06-18T17:33:14Z", "tags": ["Tesco", "Thailand", "World news", "Media", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jun/18/tesco-halts-libel-case-thailand", "title": "Tesco drops \u00a31.6m libel claim against Thai columnist", "sentences": ["Tesco has dropped a two-year \u00a31.6m libel action against a Bangkok newspaper columnist and academic who criticised the company&apos;s expansion in Thailand.", "The global retail giant, which trades as Tesco Lotus in Thailand, has withdrawn a libel writ against Kamol Kamoltrakul, a Bangkok Business News commentator.", "Other Thai journalists pursued by Tesco included Bangkok Business News columnist Nongnart Harnvilai."]}, {"article": "My father has always said: &quot;Food without spices is like a day without sushine.&quot; But for me, a day without sunshine is no big loss. When it comes to food, like everything else, we couldn&apos;t be more different. My father is easy to please. He&apos;ll eat something mediocre without a fuss. &quot;You don&apos;t think this fish tastes rubbery?&quot; I&apos;ll ask. &quot;It didn&apos;t bother me,&quot; he&apos;ll say. &quot;Until you pointed it out.&quot; He lives now in southeast Asia. My parents divorced when I was young and my father moved to Thailand. I would visit him in Bangkok and eat pad thai or chicken satay. I was a lot more adventurous when I was six. My favourite food was sticky rice with mango. But even then I was particular. He would ask if I was happy with the sticky rice. I&apos;d consider this before replying: &quot;It&apos;s too sticky.&quot; A lot of our bonding took place over food. Patterns developed. No matter how slow I&apos;m eating, it&apos;s never slow enough. A season will change before he finishes an appetiser. I take comfort in the fact that it&apos;s the one area of life where he displays anxiety. To this day, before I take a bite, he will hold up his hand in a gesture of apprehension and say: &quot;Slow down.&quot; Slow down? I haven&apos;t begun eating yet. Of course, the minute he tells me to slow down, I speed up. My father&apos;s notoriously slow eating habits used to mystify his mother, my grandmother. She was an old-fashioned Jewish grandmother who would cook for days ahead of time when she knew we were coming for a visit and pile the table high with abnormal portions of brisket and kugel and kreplach. While everyone else was pigging out on seconds and thirds, he was still gently cutting the gefilte fish. He was health-conscious before it was fashionable. He talked a lot about balance and moderation; and still does. My grandmother would set out platters of bagels, lox and cream cheese and he would choose fruit and cottage cheese. She never understood this and chalked it up to him living in the tropics. While he was conscious of what he ate for health reasons, I was conscious of what I ate for neurotic reasons. I would sit at the table and design my bagel like it was a work of art. It had to be exactly the right piece of tomato, and the ratio of lox to cream cheese was a meticulous procedure. This is going back to 1978 when I was 10 years old. Those heady days when I ate wheat. When he came to New York I&apos;d beg him to take me to Baskin-Robbins for ice cream. Thirty one flavours! I&apos;d make him read them all out. I was too small to see the ice cream displayed so he would lift me up and recite one flavour after another. I would insist he go through all 31, and in the end get the same thing. Chocolate. This happened every time. While I don&apos;t inherit my fussiness from him, the indecision might be in the DNA. When we go out to eat, I am the first to decide what to order. Recently, I was with him in Bali. He asked me ahead of time what he should know about that I can&apos;t eat. I sent him a list that was epic. He wrote back: &quot;We&apos;ll deal with it when you&apos;re here.&quot; We had breakfast, lunch and dinner together every day for two weeks. Every morning, he would (slowly) pour olive oil on to his toast. It was a massive amount and it bothered me. I couldn&apos;t help but say: &quot;Not so much.&quot; This was the ritual: him telling me to slow down, me telling him to go easy on the olive oil. One morning he asked: &quot;How many days do you have left?&quot; Most nights he ate spicy food. I can&apos;t stand spicy food, and Indonesia is like an oven; it&apos;s uncomfortable enough without the extra sweating. &quot;Sweating is great!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;The hotter the better. It gets rid of the toxins.&quot; No thanks. I prefer my mouth not be on fire and I&apos;m happy to leave the toxins inside me in air-conditioned comfort. Before I left Bali, I asked my father about his favourite meal. He smiled. &quot;My favourite meal is the next one.&quot; I thought about this. He is always looking ahead. My favourite meal is in the past.

Among these heroes of deficit spending, there was also a brief sighting of Gordon Brown. About time too. At the start of question time, the former PM slipped on to the backbenches for the first time in 25 years and sat next to his burly minder, Tom &quot;Oddjob&quot; Watson. He chatted for all of two minutes and was gone. Mercifully, attempts to body-snatch Keynes took place after Brown&apos;s departure and it was all the fault of Chris Huhne, who spoke as if he and Keynes were old drinking buddies. The Lib Dem energy secretary and gossip column star was in the chamber to promote the green features of the Osborne budget. That left him time to kill, so Huhne also tried to explain why he has embraced Tory policies he attacked before polling day. Uncle Vince Cable had been emollient and sorrowful when attempting the same maneouvre against Alistair Darling on Wednesday, but Huhne sought to outdo his erstwhile leadership rival, Nick Clegg. In a World Cup for patronising pomposity, Nick and Chris would already be through to the knock-out stages, at the top of their groups. At least Huhne has an excuse: he is an economist \u2013 they cannot help themselves \u2013 and yesterday blamed his U-turn on &quot;Greek contagion&quot;. What sounds like something British teenagers bring home from Crete is actually fear of sovereign debt, a threat that became apparent only when the prospect of office pulled the wool from Lib Dem eyes. It meant Britain must slash its debts before it was mugged by the markets, explained Huhne, careful to use long words. &quot;When the facts change, Sir, I change my mind. What do you do?&quot; he quoted his hero , Keynes, as saying. To annoy Labour further, he also cited JK Galbraith (&quot;another hero of mine&quot;) as certain to have backed the Osborne budget if he had not done the decent thing by the pensions deficit and died. Huhne insisted that the Institute for Fiscal Studies supports the Huhne-Keynes thesis. As for Labour, its new guru was Mr Micawber, &quot;hoping that something will turn up&quot;. Did they not realise they were talking to a man who has witnessed sovereign debt crises in person? &quot;I was in Seoul in 1997, in Jakarta before the food riots, in Bangkok before the collapse of the Thai baht.&quot; Thai contagion? With that medical record, it is amazing Huhne is employable anywhere in the sterling area, let alone by a fragile coalition. Ed Miliband&apos;s reply was less cerebral. The only fact that had changed Huhne&apos;s mind was a cabinet job, he argued, appealing to Simon Hughes to take up the mantle of &quot;leftwing Lib Dem tribune&quot; discarded by Huhne. Vote down the budget, cried Eddie. Hughes said he wouldn&apos;t, but you could tell he&apos;s warming to the idea.", "publicationDate": "2010-06-25T06:00:10Z", "tags": ["Chris Huhne", "House of Commons", "Liberal Democrats", "Economic policy", "Budget"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jun/25/michael-white-sketch-chris-huhne", "title": "Chris Huhne and his old mate Keynes | Michael White's sketch", "sentences": ["&quot;I was in Seoul in 1997, in Jakarta before the food riots, in Bangkok before the collapse of the Thai baht.&quot; Thai contagion?"]}, {"article": "The artist Wolfgang Tillmans, who was born in Germany but has lived for most of the past 20 years in London, won the Turner prize in 2000. It was the first time the prize had been won by an artist who worked principally with photographs, and though by this time the debate about whether photography was art was over in all but the most sclerotic circles, Tillmans raised other concerns. For most of the 1990s he had used magazines, particularly the street-style magazine i-D, as one of the outlets for his pictures, at the same time as he was exhibiting them in contemporary art galleries in London, New York and Cologne and in museums round the world. Most young artists would have shunned the first in order to be taken seriously by the second, but Tillmans saw them as equal platforms for his work. His love of street and club culture, of techno music, his support for the peace movement and his involvement in gay rights situated him at the centre of the recession-led rave culture of the early 90s. Its thrift-shop style was quickly translated into a &quot;look&quot; by mainstream fashion magazines, and though he was never a fashion photographer and always refused advertising work, that assumption is one that even now Tillmans sometimes has to counter. Three years after winning the Turner, he had a solo show at Tate Britain. While other photographers were making pictures that seemed to rival the monumentality of traditional history paintings, Tillmans&apos;s pictures, by contrast, were casual-seeming in both their subject matter and their dispensation around the walls: some small, some large, some close together in linear runs, some mounted high up, low down and, occasionally, printed large and given solitary prominence. As in a musical score, the spaces in between the pictures became as important an element in their exhibition as the pictures themselves. There was a plurality of subject matter, just as there was in the style of the installation: a still-life on a windowsill, a pair of combat trousers drying on a radiator, an aerial view of the Arctic, a swirling stain of rose-coloured pigment, a portrait of Kate Moss, Concorde in flight, a man with a backpack in a barren landscape seemingly communicating with a small deer. Comparisons were made with magazine layouts (accurately, since he&apos;d laid out his own stories in i-D, and cites it as one of the places where he began to learn about spatial relationships); some people made reference to teenage bedroom walls, which, in the seemingly ad hoc positioning, the shifts between genres and the inclusion of portraits of friends and the occasional music or fashion celebrity, also seemed pertinent. The title of the show reflected this spirit of inclusion: If One Thing Matters, Everything Matters. That, too, caused some inevitable questioning. Adrian Searle wrote in the Guardian: &quot;If everything matters, then perhaps nothing matters more than anything else. Does it mean that everything has the same value \u2013 both as an image and as an event?&quot; In what was a mostly positive review, he answered his own question just as ambiguously: yes and no. Other critics, even if they were unsure of the lasting relevance, were willing to give Tillmans the benefit of the doubt. But Matthew Collings, who had covered the rise of young British artists in his 1997 book Blimey, had lost his passion for youth. Contemplating the Turner prize shortlist, he had &quot;no idea why Tillmans is supposed to be an artist. If he wins, the message will be that the Tate . . . wants to get down and boogie in an embarrassing way with youthful airheads who read the Face.&quot; Years later, appearing on Have I Got News for You, he identified Tillmans as &quot;Man who won Turner prize . . . takes photographs of anything&quot;. If One Thing Matters, Everything Matters had a catalogue designed by Tillmans, which took the form of a chronological archive of more than 2,400 pictures, all reproduced at 6cm x 4cm, including most of those he had published or exhibited and a lot more that he said were important to him, starting with those he had made of the moon at the age of 10, by putting the camera against the eye of his telescope. In their profusion, they fostered the impression that Tillmans was bent on collecting every picture he&apos;d ever taken. His intention, he explains now, was not that at all. &quot;I don&apos;t mean it as everything is the same, but that everything has the potential to be something, and that one should not close one&apos;s eyes, just because we have preformed ideas about a value system \u2013 this is higher, this is lower. One shouldn&apos;t use it in reverse, as &apos;anything goes&apos;.&quot; He works from a building near Bethnal Green, where, since 2006, he has used the ground floor as a small gallery, Between Bridges, where he shows work that interests him, from artists such as the American David Wojnarowicz, or the German artist Isa Genzken, or the photographs from the Center for Land Use Interpretation in California, or the slogans of Jenny Holzer, one of the first artists he admired. A Holzer-like slogan that often makes its appearance in his own work is: &quot;What&apos;s wrong with redistribution?&quot; Upstairs is his large, cluttered studio, parts of which are familiar from his photograph. When I visited a week ago, the walls were principally hung with abstract paper works, that are exhibited under the collective title, Lighter. These are made without a camera, or a lens, or any additional coloured liquids, but by the effects of light on photosensitive paper as it passes through a colour processor. This is something he has been exploring for over a decade: a purist approach to colour and form that acts as a counterpoint to his figurative pictures. In isolation they are quite hard to compute. The glossy rectangles in a range of extraordinary colours for which there are few accurate names are creased along straight lines, or crumpled, to give them a three-dimensional shape, then framed in plexiglass box-frames, like small sculptures. From across the studio, with the sunlight falling on them from above, they look like the jewel-coloured windows of a white-walled church. This was a quality referred to by the critic and curator Daniel Birnbaum, who has been a supporter of Tillmans since the early 1990s. He distinguishes Tillmans from the two influential groupings that grew up around him in the 90s: the young British artists and the Dusseldorf school of photographic artists, including Andreas Gursky. &quot;He has nothing to do with the D\u00fcsseldorf artists,&quot; Birnbaum says. &quot;As for the YBAs \u2013 although he wasn&apos;t part of that group from Goldsmiths, he emerged at a time when London suddenly became so important for art. He was at the right place. He is a key person in certain networks, so he is linked to that generation. But he found his path between these prominent groups. I don&apos;t think what Wolfgang does comes out of studying. It comes more out of his own intuition.&quot; &quot;When I was growing up,&quot; Tillmans says, &quot;all the art that touched me was lens-generated, like Gerhard Richter, or Polke, Rauschenberg, Warhol. Those were the first artists I saw in the Museum Ludwig [in Cologne] and in D\u00fcsseldorf when I was 14, 15, 16. But it wasn&apos;t pop art that started this whole thing of taking photo-based images into art \u2013 there was, of course, Dada and Kurt Schwitters \u2013 he was a bit of a passion of mine. I was seeing art that touched me made out of cut-up newspapers. In Cologne or D\u00fcsseldorf you had all photo-based pictures, whether it was a painted Richter picture, or a double Elvis by Warhol, and at the same time I was at the breakfast table with my parents looking at the pictures in the Frankfurter Allgemeine and feeling that same buzz.&quot; His first pictures were torn from newspapers and reproduced on a digital photocopier, which could enlarge them by 400%. He was living in Hamburg, doing community service in lieu of military service after school, and he became part of the club scene. He was in love with British bands such as Bronksi Beat, and with Peter Saville&apos;s album covers for Joy Division and New Order. As a gay teenager growing up in the 1980s, he identified with the music of the time in a profound way. &quot;I had my first sexual experiences in 1984\u201385 and my first big Aids panic was in 1985, so the tragedy of a disco song, which others would see as superficial or as just trash music, runs very deep. It&apos;s very real, the narrow line between a night danced away and the potential of death around the corner. This sense of what others consider superficial has been a fundamental experience. It is something that anyone growing up gay is aware of from a very early age.&quot; In Hamburg he bought a cheap camera and took club pictures which he sent to i-D, where they were published. In 1990 he began a two-year course at Bournemouth College of Art and Design, and in 1992 he moved to London. For a while he acted as what Terry Jones, the founder of i-D, calls the &quot;eye&quot; of the magazine. He suggested stories. He took pictures of his friends and used them as models. He began to make still-life photographs of his own discarded clothes, battered and crumpled and suggestively sexual, as if they still held the scent and warmth of the person who had worn them. Looking at the Lighter works, it&apos;s easy to see a direct link. In 1992 he made a group of images that have become his best known: Lutz and Alex sitting in the trees, Lutz and Alex holding cock, Lutz and Alex holding each other. Lutz and Alex were two of his oldest friends. Like their names, they were androgynous: it was sometimes hard to tell them apart. Alex had cropped hair and a tough kind of beauty. Lutz was shaven-headed. They were almost the same height and build, and in the photographs they are often semi-naked. In the tree picture, Lutz is on a lower bough, wearing only a red PVC coat, which is hanging open. Alex is perched on a bough above him, naked under an olive-green parka, wide open down the front. The rest of the picture is a haze of foliage. As a couple they look naive yet knowing, an Adam and Eve for the ecstasy generation. Though it was a set-up picture, it didn&apos;t replicate an &quot;everyday moment&quot;; it created one that was both utopian and unlikely. Questioned about the level of reality in his pictures, Tillmans says firmly: &quot;The reality was there and it was put there.&quot; He showed the pictures to the London gallery owner Maureen Paley, whom he had first met in the late 80s, in Hamburg. She decided to take Lutz and Alex sitting in the trees to the Unfair, a fair for emerging artists, in Cologne in 1992. He made a large ink-jet print and hung it, unframed, with a pair of bulldog clips. From then things happened quickly. He was taken on by the Daniel Buchholz gallery in Cologne, and not long afterwards by Paley&apos;s Interim Art in London. He made his first book, which was published by Taschen in 1993. It has since sold more 50,000 copies. In 1994 he was taken on by the Andrea Rosen Gallery in New York, and in 1995 his work was included at a show at the Serpentine Gallery in London, curated by Hans-Ulrich Obrist. Promoted as a new way to make art accessible by removing the barriers between exhibition and mass consumption, it was criticised for turning art into a &quot;jumble sale&quot;. Fifteen years on, however, it is often seen as groundbreaking, and Obrist \u2013 now the Serpentine&apos;s co-director of exhibitions \u2013 has invited Tillmans to install a new solo show, taking over the whole gallery, which opens today. The last time the public saw Tillmans&apos;s work was seven years ago at Tate Britain. But if it seemed that he might continue to add pictures to his archive at his previous rate, it was a misconception. He had already started to slow down, to concentrate on abstract work. These images have taken on a spectacular and seductive presence in his installations, enlarged into enormous inkjet prints, pinned to the wall or framed, like the works of a latter-day abstract expressionist. He nods at the comparison, but denies any attempt to make surrogate paintings: &quot;I&apos;m trying to make a picture that could only be made now.&quot; Urgency III (2006) is a predominantly crimson burst of colour that suggests the dispersal of ink or paint or blood into a swirl of water. In Freischwimmer (2004), thin skeins of colour drift and curve, misting into dense clouds of pigment before unravelling and dissolving across the surface of the image. If one aspect of his early work developed towards abstraction, another took a more political route. In 2005, at Paley&apos;s gallery, he showed a new work made up of groups of photographs, cuttings from newspapers and magazines, pamphlets, advertisements, all kinds of printed matter, which he presented not on the wall but under glass on narrow custom-made wooden tables. Under the collective title Truth Study Center, they drew attention to the exercise of power behind the ideologies of Islamic fundamentalism, Catholicism, capitalism. He has subsequently included a version in various installations, adapting the subjects depending on the venue. &quot;I know that this won&apos;t change the world,&quot; he says. &quot;But then again, I think the most important thing is to start doing something. Nothing makes me more mad than when people say: &apos;Oh, I don&apos;t vote because it doesn&apos;t count, anyway.&apos; You just have to do it. I want to instil reactions in the visitor which hopefully will trigger the question &apos;Why am I reacting this way?&apos; It&apos;s a shared concern and a responsibility I feel. On the one hand I follow a vocation because I have an ability that I should exercise, but I want to use it for a reason, because I don&apos;t see that the freedoms that I enjoy are God-given realities. So I have a very healthy, activist general tension in me which feels that no, this is not gratuitous, it is important to keep this in focus.&quot; At the Serpentine, where he is showing \u2013 with a few exceptions \u2013 work that has been made in the past six years, he will include a version of the Truth Study Center on three subjects: space, food and religion. &quot;Even though, in one way, London is very well informed,&quot; he says, &quot;I think there are certain things that haven&apos;t been seen here. Because I had a strong showing here in the 90s, it&apos;s often difficult for people to change their perceptions.&quot; These days his installations have become artworks in themselves. Collectors have bought complete walls or, in some cases, an entire show, along with a precise plan of how to reassemble it. His most recent book \u2013 a catalogue of his last big museum show, Lighter, in Berlin in 2008 \u2013 collects photographs of the installations he has made over the past 20 years. It&apos;s instructive to see how they have matured, how spare they have become. Rather than mixing so many works together, he has grown confident in separating them, grouping them into discrete rooms and giving them space to breathe. Over the last couple of years, he has felt a desire &quot;to rethink my whole picture-taking with a camera&quot;. In 2009, he took a year out to travel outside Europe: &quot;To China to see a total solar eclipse, then to the Philippines, then to India, Bangkok and Dubai and Lampedusa, to Israel and Tunisia and South America . . . literally doing what other people did when they were 20.&quot; Some of the results reflect a hard-edged, automated world, full of the gadgets and gizmos we have come to rely on, including oddities such as the computerised screen on which hymn numbers are now delivered during mass at the cathedral in Venice. Others reflect contentious political divisions: a Jerusalem landscape showing the wall that separates Palestinians and Israelis; the security operation at the US/Mexican border; the wreckage of fishing boats taken from the sea off Lampedusa. And then there are giant images of foliage and flowers; party pictures, and a familiar black and white portrait from 2004, called Anders pulling splinter from his foot. This ability to absorb visual, cultural and political stimuli and transmute them into art has something of the superhuman about it. In the past few weeks I&apos;ve begun \u2013 as sometimes happens after you&apos;ve been exposed to the work of particular artist \u2013 to see the world as a series of Tillmans photographs: the balcony opposite, for example, where the man who lives there hangs out a line of washing nearly every day \u2013 work clothes, usually, dun-coloured trousers and T-shirts and jeans, and towels that flap among the climbing plants he grows in pots. Or the planes that fly behind the towers of the Barbican against a cloudy blue sky; even the notebooks on the floor of my workroom, which stand out as coloured rectangles against the floor. It is, of course, the easiest thing in the world to be pretentious about such things. But that ability to make connections between the details of our lives, to give them an aesthetic, and often emotional presence, is something Tillmans intends us to share. As he says, it&apos;s important not to be despairing. Wolfgang Tillmans is at the Serpentine Gallery, London from 26 June-19 September.

Joseph Blackburne, world No3 in the late nineteenth century, played in the US, Australia and Cuba as well as on the European tournament circuit of his time. The peripatetic tradition was maintained by Harry Golombek, Bob Wade, and Tony Miles, but their cosmopolitan tours have been eclipsed by Nigel Short. The former world title challenger has so far visited around 90 countries for tournaments, matches, or exhibitions. Recently he competed in the Bangkok Open, and this week he finished a good third at Havana&apos;s annual Capablanca Memorial. Short was only seeded fifth of six grandmasters in the elite double-rounder, and he began with a loss and a draw, complaining of excessive heat in the tournament hall.

Afghan Girl, taken in 1984, made the cover of National Geographic magazine the following year, and led to\u00a0McCurry&apos;s signing to the Magnum picture agency. It is a simple portrait distinguished by intense colour, the girl&apos;s green eyes burning with dignity and despair. It is also, in McCurry&apos;s view, far from his best shot. &quot;It was popular when it first came out,&quot; he says. &quot;But the phenomena around it grew over the years. It is a\u00a0fine picture and it&apos;s better to be remembered for one than not at all. You can spend a lifetime shooting thousands of rolls, but the good pictures are few and far between. If Afghan Girl becomes the lead to my obituary \u2013 well, hell, I can live with that.&quot; Now 60 and exhibiting his work around the world (a show has just opened in Birmingham), McCurry isn&apos;t one for artistic hang-ups. We meet in Paris, where his photographs of Nepalese street children, religious Hindu rituals and Afghan markets, from a portfolio spanning three decades, are showing in two galleries. Predictably, all 45 editions of Afghan Girl have sold out. &quot;They&apos;re going to be the last we sell,&quot; he says. &quot;There are enough out there.&quot; McCurry quit his job at a Philadelphia newspaper when he was 27. &quot;I was pretty independent. I travelled to India, Pakistan and Nepal.&quot; Why? &quot;Why not? I had studied photography and fine art a little in school, but I learned the most about taking pictures in those first two years.&quot; Three years after leaving the US, he won the Robert Capa gold medal for his evocative reporting of the Soviet-Afghan conflict in 1980. To cover the war, he had dressed in salwar kameez and turban, smuggling rolls of film across the Afghan border, sewn into his coat. Four years on he found his Afghan girl \u2013 Sharbat Gula, a 12-year-old Pashtun, in a Pakistani refugee camp. He went to India and fell in love with the country, quickly learning to weed out the cliches. &quot;You don&apos;t get that raw, original culture anywhere else. But at the same time, just because someone&apos;s wearing a turban, doesn&apos;t make it an interesting photo.&quot; Was he wary of being branded a cultural tourist? &quot;Being a foreigner, people gather round; they become self-conscious around the camera. But\u00a0I&apos;m inspired by dignity, by human kindness, by people literally living in the gutter who will smile at you with no expectation. That can be New York or New Dehli. I&apos;m not interested in discovering a new tribe \u2013 I just observe. The only thing that would worry me is if someone thought I was disrespectful. That, I&apos;d look into.&quot; McCurry makes a curious lunch date. He speaks in ellipses, often leaving sentences hanging, and fiddles apologetically with his BlackBerry. The\u00a0conversation shifts from the Mujahideen mindset, to his fascination with Buddhism, to his belief that Africa cannot compete with Asia when it comes to multiculturalism. Although his Birmingham show is being billed as a retrospective, he is not keen on the subtitle. &quot;It&apos;s a selection of my pictures,&quot; he says emphatically. &quot;When I think of a retrospective, I think of an entire career. This is a poem on a slice of my work.&quot; McCurry went digital in 2005, finding it easier to edit and send pictures from the field. He is practical about the benefits and has little patience for the nostalgic romance surrounding photographers who work only with film. &quot;Perhaps old habits are hard to break, but my experience is that the majority of my colleagues, regardless of age, have switched over.&quot; Has it made a difference to the work? &quot;The quality has never been better. You can work in extremely low light situations, for example.&quot; And it&apos;s true that his photographs are frequently breathtaking. Colour, light and composition work in concert; he has the war photographer&apos;s gift for creating dramatic portraits out of everyday scenes, capturing entire stories in a single shot. To do this, he spends nine months of the year travelling, working on magazine commissions. It helps that he isn&apos;t married and doesn&apos;t have children. &quot;I don&apos;t see [my personal life] as a sacrifice, that&apos;s too negative a way to think. But I&apos;ll never get to the point where I feel I&apos;ve done everything. This is something I will do until I drop. So, take a vacation? A vacation from what?&quot; When he travels, McCurry looks like any other US tourist \u2013 khaki trousers, a\u00a0Nikon swinging from his shoulder, a\u00a0baseball cap on his head. It&apos;s an incongruous outfit for a man who has risked his life on trips to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Burma and China. &quot;You need to be sharp and you need to be careful, especially now,&quot; he says. &quot;You can get killed over and over if you put a foot wrong in Kabul today.&quot; He relies on fixers to help him move around and build a rapport with locals.&quot;I&apos;ve never had an ear for languages,&quot; he says. He has twice been reported dead. &quot;It does affect your trust in people,&quot; he says, recalling how he put his faith in &quot;this guy in Thailand once. We were in a remote village and he stole all my equipment. He took a train straight back down to Bangkok. Unluckily for him, I took the same one. It was only when we both got off the train that we noticed each other. He went to the police station. I got my stuff back.&quot; Right now, his office in New York is preparing an intriguing project: using one of the last rolls of Kodachrome film in existence, McCurry is venturing into unfamiliar territory, taking portraits of\u00a030 celebrities in their home cities: Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese in New York, Amitabh Bachan in Mumbai. For\u00a0the first time in his career, McCurry says, he will be setting up shots, choreographing the image. &quot;Even the portraits I&apos;ve done before, they&apos;ve never been put together. It&apos;s always about waiting, watching, being ready.&quot; \u2022 See more of Steve McCurry&apos;s images at: magnumphotos.com/archive.", "publicationDate": "2010-06-28T20:31:24Z", "tags": ["Photography", "Art and design", "Exhibitions", "Culture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jun/28/steve-mccurry-photography", "title": "US photographer Steve McCurry: Go with the flow", "sentences": ["He took a train straight back down to Bangkok."]}, {"article": "The recently concluded session of the UN human rights council, an intergovernmental organisation tasked to promote and protect human rights worldwide, ended with the election of Thailand as the new president to the 47-member council. The result of the election is quite a surprise, given that Thailand has recently gone through the worst political violence the country in decades. The crackdown in May and June by government troops on anti-government redshirts resulted in the death of 88 people and injuries to at least 2,000 people. After the violent dispersal, a small militant faction of the protesters expressed their anger over the deaths by setting fires in Bangkok shopping malls and the stock exchange \u2013 all symbols of high disparities between the rich and the poor in the country. Thailand&apos;s ministry of foreign affairs issued a public statement highlighting that the election result &quot;clearly reflects the confidence that countries around the world have in Thailand and its human rights policies and standards&quot;. Can this election of the council&apos;s presidency be viewed as a realistic reflection of Thailand&apos;s human rights standards? The council was set up in 2006 to replace the contentiously debated UN commission on human rights. The election of the presidency is done on a rotating basis from five regional groups: Latin America and Caribbean, eastern Europe, Africa, western Europe and other states, and Asia. Since 2006, representatives of all four regional groups have served as presidents to the council, with the exception of Asia. Based on this, Thailand was not competing against countries with better recognised human rights records such as those governments of Switzerland or Norway. Instead, Thailand was competing against countries in Asia, namely Bangladesh, Kyrgyzstan and Maldives \u2013 all of which are criticised by rights watchdogs as human rights violators. Both Bangladesh and Kyrgyzstan, prior to the election, resigned from the contest after fierce campaigns by human rights groups claiming they were unsuitable contestants to head the council. Bangladesh, recognised by Foreign Policy&apos;s 2010 index as a failed state, is just recovering from years of emergency rule. Human Rights Watch documented the mutiny by Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) in 2009, which killed 70 people and saw arrests of more than 2,100 members of the BDR. After one year, more than 60 BDR members have died in custody. Kyrgyzstan, in the other head, is in an unstable political situation after a clash between ethnic Kyrgyz with Uzbeks, which resulted in at least 2,000 deaths. The election, therefore, only left Maldives and Thailand to compete. Maldives, a relatively young democracy, has only just emerged from a history of military coups and held its first democratic election in 2008. The country was ruled by Maumoon Gayoom, who denied free and fair elections, for 20 years. Being a small country, the Maldives lacked the political leverage required to convince member states of their leadership. This is how the council was left with Thailand. As chair of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2009, Thailand had strong support from the member states in addition to many other states that could be provided by its ambassador. We can see that the election result is differs from the simple explanation given by the Thai government that Thailand is a champion of human rights. Based on this, what can we make of the situation and how could this effect the country? First, a Geneva-based human rights activist told me that the election of the president &quot;does not mean, if strictly speaking, that Thailand is the council president&quot;. However, it is more appropriate to highlight that ambassador Sihasak Phuangketkeow, the permanent representative of Thailand to the UN, is serving as the president in his personal capacity. She also highlighted that &quot;many times the capacity and capability of the ambassador is an important component for consideration when it comes to the presidency&quot;. Sihasak, given that he was tasked to draft the terms of reference for the ASEAN commission on human rights, is recognised for his professionalism and his openness to human rights groups. Furthermore, as the council approaches their 2011 review process, it was imperative that the president be someone with a deep understanding of the rules and procedures of the council so as to lead the review process in a confident manner. Second, Thailand&apos;s position can open up space for groups to call on the government to live up to the highest standards of human rights which includes the need to set up an internationally recognised investigation into the deaths of the protesters, including six unarmed civilians in the temple used as a refuge for women and children. The Thai government shall also take in the demands of 55 Asian NGOs by allowing UN independent experts (IEs) to enter Thailand. They will conduct human rights investigations on issues such as freedom of expression, extrajudicial executions and arbitrary detention. This leeway used to pressure the government shall include the end to emergency decree, which allowed the arbitrary arrests of at least 417 protesters by the government and the censorship of news websites critical of the government. Reporters Without Borders has documented at least 4,500 websites critical of the government that have been blocked by the government since April, while Freedom Against Censorship Thailand in a personal communication with the writer puts the number at 12,000. Last, the Thai government must know that as the council&apos;s president, the pressure that it will face will be much fiercer than before as it is in the position of exposing itself to more criticisms and scrutiny. It must expect extensive pressure from rights groups and governments alike if it fails to set itself up as an example, as the head of an organisation whose aim is to &quot;uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2010-06-30T14:02:45Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Protest", "United Nations", "World news", "Human rights", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/30/thailand-no-human-rights-champion", "title": "Thailand is no human rights champion | Pokpong Lawansiri", "sentences": ["After the violent dispersal, a small militant faction of the protesters expressed their anger over the deaths by setting fires in Bangkok shopping malls and the stock exchange \u2013 all symbols of high disparities between the rich and the poor in the country."]}, {"article": "Tomas Berdych has made a name for himself as the man who beat Roger Federer. The question now is whether that will be the extent of his achievements at these Championships. If he is going to reach his first major final, Berdych will have to beat Novak Djokovic and that is something he has never been able to do. Djokovic won both their previous matches in straight sets: 7-5, 6-1 in Bangkok in 2008 and 6-3, 6-2 in Miami the following year. Given the way Berdych is playing at the moment, though, such form will not count for much. The Czech has been recognised as a talented player ever since he came on to the tour in 2003 but until 2010 he had made only one major quarter-final, here at Wimbledon in 2007. That changed at the French Open earlier this year, when\u00a0Berdych thrashed Andy Murray in straight sets in the fourth round, 6-4, 7-5, 6-3, and beat Russia&apos;s Mikhail Youzhny in even more convincing style to reach the semi-finals. There he lost to Sweden&apos;s Robin Soderling. Berdych agrees that he has improved out of sight in the last six months. &quot;It&apos;s due to many things,&quot; he says. &quot;First of all it is that you win a couple of matches in the beginning of the year and then you get a confidence. It keeps going and going.&quot; In March Berdych beat Federer in Miami.\u00a0&quot;You get more and more experience,&quot; he says now. &quot;As I get older I get more focused, you know, mentally stronger than before. That&apos;s what you need.&quot; Against Federer on Wednesday he held his composure together right through to the final game, when he collapsed after missing a match point. Even then he was soon back on his feet, ready to close out the win. Djokovic says that the Berdych he will face today is of a different calibre from the one he has beaten in the past. &quot;He has improved a lot from the baseline,&quot; the Serb says. &quot;He has always had the powerful strokes and shots but he was making a lot of unforced errors before.\u00a0Now he is cutting that to a minimum. He&apos;s becoming more patient. And of course, his serve is always there.&quot; Berdych has served 87 aces in the championships so far, averaging 18 per match. The secret is in the ball toss. Berdych is able to serve to both corners of the court\u00a0without changing the direction of his toss, so his opponents are left with few clues as to which way he will go. Given that he is sending the ball down at an average of around 130mph, his serve is a formidable weapon. But then Djokovic is among the best returners of serve in the men&apos;s game. He sits second in the list for winning the most points when returning in the Championships so far. Just as importantly he has been to seven major semi-finals in the last four years, even though he has won only two of them \u2013 at the 2007 US Open, when he lost the final to Federer, and at the 2008 Australian Open, which he won. Among the five semi-finals he has lost is one at Wimbledon in 2007, in which he retired while playing Rafael Nadal. &quot;It was a very different situation back then,&quot; he said. &quot;I was less experienced and I wasn&apos;t as fit as I am today. This time I&apos;m ready mentally and physically.

Beneath the picture of the exiled billionaire former prime minister \u2013 ousted in a coup, convicted of corruption but still a hero to millions \u2013 Jakrapon Botirak was holding court, discussing the future of Thailand and its fractious politics. &quot;This [cafe] is not a good business,&quot; he said. &quot;It loses a lot of money. But it is important that people have a place where they can come to talk about our country freely. This is a place for that.&quot; Thailand&apos;s north, populated largely by small-scale farmers and shop owners \u2013 the country&apos;s &quot;rural poor&quot; \u2013 is known as the redshirt heartland. It is from here that the anti-government movement, whose protesters occupied the streets of Bangkok for more than two months, drew its numerical strength and where it remains strongest. On Tuesday the government signalled that the movement was still a threat, as it extended a state of emergency for another three months in about a third of the country, including the areas around Chiang Mai. &quot;The people here are still red,&quot; Jakrapon said. &quot;Not on the surface, [there are] no more shirts, but they still have the red feeling, they still oppose the government.&quot; Since the violent crackdown by government troops in May that ended the redshirts&apos; protest on the streets of the capital, the movement, once proudly public, has been forced underground. Few supporters are now willing to identify themselves or talk openly about the cause. Redshirt stickers and flags, once ubiquitous across this part of Thailand, are a scarcity now. All that remain are anonymous, vague threats of &quot;guerrilla warfare&quot;, and &quot;uprising against the government&quot;, all without detail or timetable. Police are still actively searching for known political activists in Chiang Mai. There is, reportedly, a list several dozen names long, but most of the people are in hiding. The Red Radio station, where Jakrapon was a DJ, has been raided several times and its broadcasting equipment confiscated under Thailand&apos;s emergency decree law. Jakrapon&apos;s coffee shop is one of the few places in the town that remains defiantly red. But beneath their seeming acquiescence to the government&apos;s reasserted authority, people in Chiang Mai are still enraged, according to Jakrapon. &quot;People are still very angry with the government. The government did not choose the smooth way to end the protests, by talking. They chose the violent way, by shooting.&quot; Fourteen people were killed as troops marched on the reds&apos; protest camp in central Bangkok on 19 May, bringing to at least 88 the number of people who died in the political violence over 68 \u00a0days of protests. But the forcible end to the protest has not dissolved the disaffection felt by many Thais towards their government. &quot;People are ready to fight again, they are not afraid. This is only a rest, a break,&quot; Jakrapon said. Despite the portrait overhead, Jakrapon said the redshirt movement had moved beyond its former figurehead, the fugitive Thaksin. &quot;Thaksin has no special rights or power. The reds are about democracy now.&quot; This is debatable. Thaksin&apos;s foreign billions bankrolled much of the long-running demonstration, and opinion persists at senior diplomatic levels that it was his refusal to negotiate with the government that led to the demonstration&apos;s final bloody end. But the redshirts in Chiang Mai say they oppose the government led by Abhisit Vejjajiva because it was never popularly elected. They say it is a puppet administration for the interests of the wealthy elite and the military figures of Bangkok. And, regardless of motivation, in that distant capital it is recognised that while the protest might have been crushed, the discontent that drove it remains. &quot;Things have calmed down,&quot; said Bangkok&apos;s governor, Sukhumband Paribatra. &quot;But I am of the opinion that things are not back to normal yet. It may be just an interlude, I hope I&apos;m wrong, but I think it is a possibility that this is a quiet interlude between two crises. This is why I&apos;m very worried.&quot; Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political analyst at Chulalongkorn University, in Bangkok, said the government faced a difficult task trying to reconcile Thailand&apos;s yawning political divide. &quot;The early signs aren&apos;t good. There&apos;s vindictiveness in the air.&quot; Tawangwong Yoduppatham runs a tiny shop on the northern outskirts of Chiang Mai. He went by train to Bangkok four times to join the protests and was behind the reds&apos; tyre-and-bamboo barricades when the troops advanced. &quot;The soldiers, they shoot at everybody, even people who are peaceful. I saw people killed. We run, we have to leave, but we leave more angry at the government.&quot; He is cynical about government talk of an early election, a &quot;circuit breaker&quot; on the political impasse gripping Thailand. Tawangwong believes that even when the parliamentary term expires at the end of next year there will not be elections. &quot;Nobody here trusts the government. They say one thing and do another. They lie to us.&quot; He added that the sense of peacefulness in Thailand&apos;s north belied the people&apos;s anger. But with the redshirt leadership in hiding or in prison on terrorism charges, there is a vacuum at the head of the anti-government movement. &quot;There are two groups of people, some who want more protests for the world to see, and other people who want to go underground, to do violence against the government.

Thomson&apos;s intellectual and intuitive understanding of how cities work, and how traffic flows, made him the brains of a campaign against roads that could have caused huge damage to London. Thomson, whose father was a\u00a0businessman, was born in Hull and grew up in Yorkshire and Kent. John, as he was christened, demonstrated at an early age a determination that was to be a hallmark of his life. Climbing to the top of a ladder at the age of four, he\u00a0refused to come down unless he was called Michael. And so he was. After school at Bedford, followed by the London School of Economics (LSE), he\u00a0tried his hand at banking with Barclays in Dubai. Deciding he had taken a wrong turn, he\u00a0headed off in the direction of\u00a0transport, first at the ministry itself and then at its research wing, the Road Research Laboratory. There, as secretary of an expert panel on pay-as-you-drive road pricing, he made his first major contribution to transport thinking. The Smeed report of 1964, which Thomson drafted, argued in favour of the development of\u00a0pricing methods. Transport ministers have since shied away from the idea, but others, from Singapore to central London, drew on an analysis of consummate clarity, set out in sparse and fluent prose. Thomson&apos;s next contribution followed his appointment as research fellow in transport at the LSE in October 1965. Britain was by then increasingly committed to the motor age, and planners at the Greater London council (GLC) had decided to circle the capital, at astronomical cost, with radial motorways. Residents across the city soon learned that these huge roads would mean the destruction of 20,000 homes, blight more and, on countless streets, add to traffic, noise and fumes. Opposition began to mount locally, but Thomson and others saw the need to put forward a case that was London-wide. This need was filled by the London Amenity and Transport Association (LATA), a\u00a0grouping of 60-odd local societies. Thomson was its chairman. The LATA gave Thomson a broad platform. He argued his case, first in the LATA publication Motorways in London (1969) and then at a public inquiry as chief witness for both LATA and the London Motorway Action Group, headed by Douglas Jay, Labour MP for Battersea North. Thomson&apos;s proposition was that &quot;ringways&quot; would not only be destructive, but would also fail to deliver what Londoners wanted. By\u00a0creating room for more, and longer, car journeys, they would lead not to less congestion, but more. And by encouraging more car travel, they would withdraw passengers and revenue from the buses and tubes. London&apos;s transport problem was not only poor roads: it was equally the difficulties faced by pedestrians, cyclists and passengers by bus and rail. In seeing this so clearly, Thomson was far ahead of his time. The objectors at the inquiry did not win the battle, but the war against the ringways was duly won. Although planning for the roads had gone on under both Labour and Conservative London councils, it fell to the former, following the 1973 election, to cancel them. Lack of funds was a key issue but Thomson&apos;s arguments made it easier for the politicians to override their highway engineers. In the 1970s Thomson moved to Paris and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, where he headed a study of inter-city transport. In 1977, after a world tour, he published Great Cities and Their Traffic. In it, he noted that choosing a transport strategy is &quot;a choice of way of life ... a choice that may affect different sections of the population very differently ... (and thus) a highly political question&quot;. In a still valued textbook, he made abundantly clear the nature of that choice. Aged 48, and by then a global transport authority, he worked worldwide as a consultant. A colleague in Bangkok noted: &quot;Michael was an original thinker. Others in the team would arrive with computers and boxfiles. He took out a pen and pad and said, &apos;what exactly are we trying to do?&apos;&quot; And, whether in Bogota or Taipei, thanks to a mixture of observation, theory and intuition, he always seemed to know. In 1955 Thomson married Elizabeth Paish, with whom he had three daughters. For 27 years they lived in Kentchurch, Herefordshire, where he learned to play the church organ and, every morning, after a run, plunged into a cold bath. In 1997 he was widowed. The following year he married Wendy Webb. He is survived by Wendy and his daughters, Calvia, Pippa and Lydia. \u2022 John Michael Thomson, transport economist, born 1 January 1928; died 4\u00a0May 2010", "publicationDate": "2010-07-13T17:14:19Z", "tags": ["Transport policy", "Politics past", "Congestion charging", "Politics"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jul/13/michael-thomson-obituary", "title": "Michael Thomson obituary", "sentences": ["A colleague in Bangkok noted: &quot;Michael was an original thinker."]}, {"article": "This summer, women of all ages are once more being exhorted to get the perfect &quot;bikini body&quot; by every tabloid, gossip circular and glossy magazine. Singer Katy Perry and heiresses the Kardashian sisters are among this week&apos;s &quot;best bikini body&quot; celebrities, and ordinary women everywhere are trying to emulate their fairytale lifestyles by purchasing a particular cellulite-busting body scrub or embarking on a bizarre starvation diet. But this is Britain, not Bangkok or Barbados. The vast majority of women in the UK aren&apos;t in any position to throw on a tiny swimsuit and stroll down to the beach. Even at the height of summer, last week was jumper weather across much of the country, and most British women cannot afford to go abroad \u2013 especially during this financial crisis, which has seen a 15% drop in overseas holidays. Overall, the amount of time the average British woman is likely to spend in a bikini this or any other summer is anywhere between small and nonexistent, so why go to such expense and effort to prepare ourselves for this sort of physical scrutiny? The bikini itself has a sinister semiotic history. It was invented by French lingerie salesman Louis R\u00e9ard in 1946 as part of a competition to design the world&apos;s smallest swimsuit. That summer, a small clutch of coral islands in the Pacific called Bikini Atoll was in the news, because a series of nuclear weapons tests codenamed Operation Crossroads had been launched there, requiring the evacuation of the local population. R\u00e9ard named his invention after the devastated test site because of its inference of danger and scandal, at a time when words like &quot;atomic&quot; were being used to describe momentous cultural events. Those with a stake in the mythology of the garment now focus on its namesake island as a tropical paradise, but bikini ideology is poisoned with the cultural fallout of the mid-20th century in more ways than one. When it finally became popular in the 1960s, the bikini was a symbol of physical liberation, of beautiful women reacting to the stern sexual prudery of previous decades by exposing as much skin to the sun as they pleased. Today, as with many iterations of the sexual emancipation rhetoric of the 1960s, wearing a bikini is no longer associated with pleasure and daring, but with anxiety, dieting rituals and joyless physical performance. Famous women whose &quot;bikini bodies&quot; are found to be acceptable are praised for the surgical procedures and &quot;gruelling&quot; diet and exercise regimes that have brought them to this point of transcendence. Those who fail, like Tyra Banks and Cherie Blair, must face down the big red circle of public opprobrium. The bikini body is not supposed to be naturally occurring: it is a quasi-religious state of myth and artifice to which only the truly virtuous can aspire. The rituals of the bikini body link the obsessive self-denial that has become a watchword for feminine social capital with a tragic aspirational escape fantasy. Women waste huge amounts of time and money and forgo countless meals for this fantasy, whereby we must be ready at a moment&apos;s notice to be whisked away to an exotic beach location where photographers will clamour to take pictures of us in our scanties. The bikini body has become cultural shorthand for a moral standard of female perfection whereby any physical flaw should be regarded as a source of shame, an obstacle to collective fantasies of glamour and happiness. The bikini was once a symbol of sexual emancipation, but for women in the 21st century its original connotations of personal empowerment have become just another set of rules for self-control.", "publicationDate": "2010-07-19T21:00:31Z", "tags": ["Life and style", "Fashion", "Feminism"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/19/bikini-body-anyone", "title": "Bikini body, anyone? | Laurie Penny", "sentences": ["But this is Britain, not Bangkok or Barbados."]}, {"article": "Old enmities were put to one side as Colin Montgomerie announced his backroom team for October&apos;s Ryder Cup, confirming that Darren Clarke, Thomas Bjorn and Paul McGinley will act as vice-captains in the contest against the United States at Celtic Manor in south Wales. &quot;The four of us have huge respect from the players that will be in the team,&quot; Montgomerie said, flanked by his three Ryder Cup amigos. &quot;It is the strongest team in terms of making decisions.&quot; And the most fractious. Or at least it used to be. Only five years ago Clarke was one of the most persistent inquisitors when Montgomerie appeared before a European Tour players&apos; committee over the infamous &quot;Jakarta-gate&quot; affair after which the Scot, who had been accused of taking an incorrect drop following a rain delay, was censured for his conduct. Since then, relations between the two might kindly be described as cordial. Likewise the relationship between the European captain and Bjorn, who were involved in a very public argument during a 2004 tournament in Bangkok, when the Dane accused Montgomerie of &quot;behaving like a three-year-old&quot; after being disturbed by the Scot while hitting a shot. &quot;What happens in the heat of the moment, that is part of sport,&quot; Bjorn said today. &quot;Monty and myself are very fierce competitors, we are very strong in our minds and we have got a very similar way of doing things. When you are out week in, week out, you look after yourself. But the great thing about all four of us, and certainly Monty, and myself, when you go into these team events, we have an ability to put everything aside, we are here as a team.&quot; Clarke was equally anxious to forget old arguments with the new boss. &quot;Everybody who is at the top of their sport have their ups and downs. They are all in the past. This is all about helping him, along with Thomas and Paul, getting the best atmosphere we can to help the guys play as well as they can.&quot; Certainly, the quartet of European Tour veterans put on a united front for the cameras at Wentworth today, with Montgomerie emphasising his captaincy would be a team effort, in obvious, albeit unstated, contrast to that of Nick Faldo, whose backroom team at the 2008 Ryder Cup consisted of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal and DJ Spoony. &quot;Any team, any winning team, has fantastic support behind the scenes and my three vice-captains are very experienced, very passionate, very well-respected and committed to the regaining of the Ryder Cup,&quot; he said. &quot;The four of us will be making the decisions, not just me.&quot; Montgomerie revealed he had contemplated asking Olaz\u00e1bal to join his team but his recent injury problems had reduced his playing opportunities and, therefore, his contact with the current generation of European players. In any case, the Spaniard, the favourite to lead the European team in 2012, was reportedly lukewarm to the idea of reprising his role as a vice\u2011captain after his 2008\u00a0experience. McGinley, Bjorn and Clarke, by contrast, have been playing virtually every week on tour, and were enthusiastic about the prospect of playing a role off the course. &quot;Darren beamed from ear to ear when I asked him,&quot; Montgomerie said, adding that the Ulsterman&apos;s absence during the last Ryder Cup was a significant loss to the team. &quot;Darren&apos;s presence in the locker room will be a fabulous asset. He knows Graeme McDowell and Rory McIlroy, who are already in the team, alongside his good friend Lee Westwood. That&apos;s a quarter of the team he knows very well indeed.&quot; Clarke was the most surprising of Montgomerie&apos;s three vice-captain choices, not least because he has shown some decent form in recent weeks, coming second at the Scottish Open, leaving him on 21st place in the Ryder Cup points list. Last week the Ulsterman said he hoped to be a member of the playing squad at Celtic Manor. That was before Montgomerie made the offer of a vice-captaincy in the run-up to last week&apos;s Open Championship at St Andrews, although in the unlikely event that he makes it on to the team he would\u00a0play. &quot;I would like to give Monty another headache,&quot; he said. &quot;But I want to be there, one way or another. Looking at the team, I get on great with everyone all the time. It is the part of the way I play and the way I am.

Is India a high risk area and what can we do to prevent getting malaria?Carly Elia, by email I&apos;ve just visited all sorts of websites I don&apos;t normally frequent trying to find out whether Cheryl Cole was taking anti-malarial pills and other preventatives, but while my life is now richer for knowing who Derek Hough is, the answer is inconclusive. While no treatment is 100% effective, you can dramatically reduce the risk of contracting malaria by taking the course of tablets for where you&apos;re going, and reduce it even further by liberally using mosquito repellent and covering your arms and legs with loose, light clothing. The useful Malaria Hotspots website suggests that the risk of contracting malaria in Goa is variable and anti-malarials are usually advised. Not everyone does though, and you will find different opinions if you look around the web. It always seems odd to me, however, that given what a dismal and dangerous experience having malaria is so many people don&apos;t take prophylactics. Speak to your doctor and get what you need. Useful for general travel health advice is the website fitfortravel.scot.nhs.uk. I have recently decided to go to Australia over New Year. I was wondering if it&apos;s best to book flights out there now or leave it to the last minute? Would there be a big price difference the later I leave it? Alice Laura Jenkins, by email If you&apos;re travelling anywhere between early December and early January you should book early. There are no late deals available for this, the busiest of times to travel. When it comes to Australia, demand for economy fares is high and you may find that choice is already restricted. Ben Briggs of Austravel  says: &quot;It&apos;s not a case of how much flights will be if customers wait until the last minute to book, it&apos;s a case of whether there will be any seats left. Currently, December is Austravel&apos;s most requested departure month and customers are realising that the most popular dates around 9 December have already sold out. It is around this date that airfares also tend to rise significantly. What&apos;s more, there is also very little availability to return before 12 January.&quot; The fact that January is summer holiday time in Australia adds to the congestion. Austravel also notes that if customers are flexible with their travel dates, good-value fares are still available. Malaysia Airlines has an offer flying to Sydney from \u00a3899 departing 2 December and returning 13 January. For dates nearer to Christmas, Thai Airways has availability departing 15 December and returning 5 January from \u00a31,499. Briggs also suggests that &quot;if you are happy to stop over en route for a couple of days more options become available&quot;. We will be in Dubrovnik next May. I&apos;ve been trying to figure out the best way to get from Dubrovnik to Verona in Italy. I thought about a boat from Split to Ancona and then the train, but that means about two hours from Dubrovnik to Split, 4 1/2 hours on the ferry (if there is a fast boat at that time of year) and then four or more hours on the train to Verona. Of course that doesn&apos;t include time to make the connections. What about a flight from Dubrovnik to Venice or Bologna and then the train? Which airlines do those routes? How much do you think it might cost? David Chudnovsky, by email Ironically, the cheapest route I have found involves flying back to the UK from Dubrovnik with British Airways, changing planes at Gatwick and catching another flight to Verona \u2013 both legs are currently on offer in May for around \u00a3160 in total and the whole journey takes 10 hours. But I&apos;m assuming this isn&apos;t what you had in mind. Dubrovnik&apos;s transport links reflect the fact that Croatia&apos;s Dalmatian coast is a holiday destination rather than a national capital or business and travel hub. Therefore fast ferries are seasonal \u2013 last year the SNAV-operated Split to Ancona fast boats ran from early June to early September \u2013 and most flights go to and from northern European destinations. If you want to get somewhere out of the main season then the journey is complicated. Slower ferries will be your main no-fly option unless you wanted to do the whole route by bus. There is a bit of land travel involved whichever route you take, either heading direct from Dubrovnik to Bari or first heading north and going from Split to Ancona. Both these services are run by Jadrolinija and fares depend on which class and route you opt for. The only faster option is taking two flights to Verona, requiring travel via Rome and costing at least \u00a3250 with Croatia Airlines and Alitalia. It would be cheaper to travel to Milan or Bergamo instead of Verona, via Rome, Zagreb or both, but you then need to travel onward to Verona by rail. I&apos;ve been invited to visit a mate who lives in Singapore and to watch the Grand Prix while I&apos;m there in September. I&apos;d like to combine my trip with a few weeks of sunshine and had planned to head up to Thailand for 10 days or so with my girlfriend but from the various forums I&apos;ve read, it looks like it might be a bit wet. Should we risk it? If so, where should we go for a bit of peace and quiet, maybe a bit of pampering. Looking at a budget of \u00a3100 a night between the two of us. Also, what&apos;s the latest situation in Thailand in terms of the protests?Simon Towndrow, by email There&apos;s a remarkably detailed and helpful post on Lonely Planet&apos;s Thorn Tree about wet-season travel to Thailand, which is well worth a read. The usual advice on this \u2013 that it rains most days but is sunny in between downpours \u2013 is essentially true, but it&apos;s important to note that there&apos;s no guarantee that this will be the case. At the end of September it is drier on the southern Gulf islands, such as Koh Samui, than it is on the Andaman Coast, which bears the brunt of the southwest monsoon. While there shouldn&apos;t be enough rain to ruin your trip, you will find that some smaller or more remote resorts are closed. You may wish to play it safe by heading somewhere you&apos;re not dependent on getting to by boat, but many travellers also suggest the only precaution you need take is packing an umbrella. If you do choose to head for a flight-only option, you can fly direct with Bangkok Airways from Singapore to Koh Samui (returns from \u00a3170; bangkokair.com) and either settle in here or divide your time between this island and neighbouring Koh Pha-Ngan. Both have a real mix of accommodation available, from cheap and cheerful shacks to blow-out resorts, with lots of reasonably priced and fashionable options available. I-escape has a good selection of places to stay on these islands. One stand-out is the Muang Kulaypan resort on Koh Samui (kulaypan.com), a design hotel whose rates drop to \u00a385 per night in the wet season. It&apos;s business as usual for many in Thailand after the protests in May and June \u2013 even though the state of emergency has been extended.

Her years as a political prisoner have not blunted her sense of humour. &quot;Some people call us the &apos;three princesses of Burma&apos;, but to the government, we are the three witches,&quot; she laughs as, free now, she walks through the gardens of her once stately, now crumbling colonial home on a hilltop in the Burmese capital. The &quot;princesses&quot; \u2013 she, Nay Ye Ba Swe, and Mya Than Than Nu \u2013 are too old for fairytales, she says, and the appellation she still finds faintly humorous. They are princesses because their fathers were all prime ministers of Burma, part of the revered generation that fought for, and in 1948 won, freedom from British rule before it was snatched away again in a military coup in 1962. The daughters have been friends since childhood, and have remained part of each others&apos; lives despite long years in prison and in exile. All are free now, though they are watched constantly and regularly harassed by the military&apos;s special branch and its network of undercover spies. Arranging to meet is still fraught with risk. The interview with the Guardian is the first they have ever given together. The fourth daughter alongside whom they grew up, Burma&apos;s most famous democracy activist, Aung San Suu Kyi, remains under house arrest. &quot;She is like a sister to us,&quot; Cho Cho Kyaw Nyein says. &quot;Our fathers were the best of friends with Suu&apos;s father.&quot; Nearly half a century since their fathers were in power, the daughters see themselves as carrying on their families&apos; work, still fighting for democracy in a country that has known it for only 14 short years of a troubled history. They have announced their candidacy as secretaries-general of the newly formed Democratic party, and will stand in this year&apos;s promised elections. It is a hopeless fight, however, and they know it: three women, backed by a hastily created, barely funded party against the might of a military junta which has ruled Burma with an iron fist for 48 years. But they spend their days, and their shoestring budget, knocking on village doors, trying to convince people too frightened speak to politicians of the importance not just of voting for them, but of voting at all. This is a country that has not held an election since 1990. Internationally, this year&apos;s poll has been condemned even before a date has been set as a sham rigged to entrench military rule. But the daughters see merit in giving people a choice that is not the military and hope the ballot will be the first step in a gradual move to democracy. They have seen too many efforts at sudden revolutionary change \u2013 the student uprising of 1988, the monk-led saffron revolution in 2007 \u2013 flare brightly but ultimately fail amid military violence to be swayed by promises of instant reform. Nay Ye Ba Swe says change in Burma will be slow. &quot;To establish a credible democratic system will take a decade or more. We need to go slowly, step by step, because we know we are facing a very tough situation. We just can&apos;t go ahead and expect democracy overnight \u2013 we have to give it time, and make sacrifices.&quot; Flawed though these elections will be, the daughters believe participation is better than boycott. &quot;I firmly believe \u2026 without participating in this election, you won&apos;t get democracy smoothly,&quot; says Cho Cho Kyaw Nyein. &quot;I want to change the system and the government \u2026 but I don&apos;t want to go through more bloodshed or a lot of people being sent to Insein [prison].&quot; The three women are saddened that their &quot;sister&quot; Aung San Suu Kyi will not have her name on a ballot paper. Her continuing detention, combined with electoral laws that appear to have been deliberately written to exclude her, has meant that she cannot take part in the election. In response, her party, the National League for Democracy, has chosen to boycott the poll. &quot;She is very much loved and respected by the Burmese people and boycotting the election is her own decision. We really hoped that she would participate together with us in this election, but she said no and we can&apos;t do anything,&quot; Cho Cho Kyaw Nyein says. Like Aung San Suu Kyi, she knows the price of a life in politics in Burma. She grew up in the heady days after the second world war and watched as her father reached the post of deputy prime minister during the country&apos;s fractious early days of self-governance. But after the military seized control of the country her family was targeted. In 1990 she followed her father, mother and two brothers into jail for her opposition to the ruling military. She spent seven years in Rangoon&apos;s notorious Insein prison, &quot;a horrible place to live, like hell&quot;. But few people in Burma have her background in politics. No one in the country under the age of 38 has ever voted before \u2013 and the results of the 1990 elections, won in a landslide by Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s party, were ignored by the junta. Cho Cho Kyaw Nyein says getting people to the ballot box in a country where political opposition is violently crushed is the priority for the 31 opposition and ethnic minority parties that have so far registered for the election. &quot;When I went around the country, people are very scared of politicians. They don&apos;t want to come near us, they say it is safer to stay away from the politicians, or they will be bullied by the government. &quot;I said, &apos;you&apos;ve got to know this is your right&apos;, we have been deprived of this right to vote since 1962 \u2026 we have been living under these rules and hardships under the military regime for so long \u2026 but this is the right time.&quot; Mya Than Than Nu&apos;s father, U Nu, was Burma&apos;s first democratically elected prime minister, and also its last. During his third stint in office, he was overthrown in a military coup and jailed. He spent much of the rest of his life in exile in India and the UK. But before he died in 1995, U Nu told his daughter there was unfinished business in his homeland. &quot;My father said to me, &apos;You have done much for people all over the world. You need to go back to work for your own people. The people of Burma need you more&apos;.&quot; Jack Davies is a Guardian journalist writing under a pseudonym Election prospects: Ban on Suu Kyi&apos;s party puts regime in pole position Elections are an unknown quantity in Burma, a country that has not held a poll since 1990 \u2013 or a free and fair ballot for 48 years. Even the date of this year&apos;s election is still unknown, though there has been speculation the October 10 \u2013 10/10/10 \u2013 will be chosen because it is considered an auspicious date by the astrologers and numerologists often consulted by the ruling military generals on important matters of state. Senior regime figures continue to promise elections will be held &quot;sometime this year&quot;, and across the country, anticipation is high, despite the fact no one knows what to expect. By far the biggest party will be the regime&apos;s own, the Union Solidarity and Development party, which is expected to field candidates in every seat. Thirty-nine parties have been approved to participate in the elections. Eleven are regime or proxy-regime parties, 26 represent ethnic minorities, and five are broad-based &quot;opposition&quot; parties, such as the Democratic party. But the leading opposition party for decades in Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s National League for Democracy, will not participate. New electoral laws forbid the participation of people serving a prison sentence or detention order, such as Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been held under house arrest by the junta for 14 of the past 20 years. With their figurehead, and Burma&apos;s most powerful democracy advocate, sidelined, the NLD argued the elections were farcical, and has urged a boycott. The move has been criticised by some, who argue that these elections will be a step towards democracy, at least. The poll will also enact Burma&apos;s new constitution, &quot;voted&quot; for with a huge majority in suspicious circumstances just days after Cyclone Nargis devastated the country. It will guarantee the military at least 25% of the seats in parliament, as well as key ministries in the government. Speaking in Bangkok this week, new Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Jeremy Browne said Burma&apos;s elections would be neither free nor fair. &quot;We do not regard the coming election as a legitimate expression of public opinion.

This feature is a bit like that, except it&apos;s about belief and will never mention Coleen McLoughlin, unless she becomes a nun. \u2724 As it happens there have been lots of nuns in the news this week \u2013 singing, fugitive and fake \u2013 but let&apos;s kick off with a story about Wrexham, a town so often in tune with the zeitgeist. The BBC reports that the council there is considering offering a funeral that mixes up the divine with the secular. Civil ceremonies could fill a gap in the market, it is claimed, by allowing people to pick traditional elements of a burial or cremation without having to go the whole religious hog. Stephen Caldecott, a local funeral director, thinks the civil funerals could catch on. &quot;There is a demand for this kind of service,&quot; he said. &quot;A lot of people still want a traditional funeral, but we are getting more and more requests from people who do not want a minister but do want a hymn.&quot; It was Benjamin Franklin who said nothing in life was certain except taxes and death. The folk of Wrexham, it would seem, are hedging their bets with the latter. \u2724 Pakistan is reaching out to Buddhists. In a classic case of fiddling while Rome burns, diplomatic, tourism and economic officials are making concerted efforts to bring more Buddhists across the border. The Bangkok Post says the Pakistani ambassador Sohail Mahmood has organised visits by Thai Buddhist leaders to Pakistan&apos;s Buddhist heritage sites such as Taxila, Takht-i-Bahi and the neighbouring city remains at Sahr-i-Bahlol. Both are among the six Unesco heritage sites in Pakistan. Pakistani tourism officials also want to learn from the Thai experience of crisis management. One said: &quot;We need to rectify the negative propaganda against Pakistan. Negative travel advisories are damaging the image of the country as reported in the western media.&quot; Ah yes, those pesky travel advisories. Nothing to do with sectarian violence then. \u2724 Women&apos;s headgear continues to fascinate the media and sometimes in not so obvious ways. The Toronto Star claims turban wearing \u2013 among young Sikh women \u2013 is on the rise. &quot;Local Sikh leaders estimate at least a few hundred women wear the turban. In fact, there are more women who wear the turban in North America than in Punjab, India, where the majority of Sikhism followers live.&quot; Can anyone verify this? &quot;People are way more traditional here&quot;, haminder Singh, a Mississauga-based Sikh scholar, tells the paper. &quot;They are worried about losing their religion and culture and so become more orthodox&quot;, he said. &quot;It&apos;s a way for some people to protect their religion.&quot; There are varying views on whether Sikh women are required to wear the turban although there is nothing in Sikh tradition that says women are required to cover their hair. Mandeep Kaur Uppal, the focus of the article, says she wears the turban because &quot;our gurus said all Sikhs should wear it, and that includes women&quot;. \u2724 At least in this instance women are deciding what to put on their heads, or not, and why. For Muslim women, it appears that male intervention is still required. There are numerous, breathless, reports of a Saudi scholar saying it is OK for women to uncover their faces if there is a veil ban in their home country, a statement sure to cause a surge of niqabi liberation in mainland Europe. No mention is made of the fact that nobody really pays that much attention to Saudi scholars \u2013 except the media and the Saudis \u2013 and that there are lots of Saudis who say a lot of stuff all the time. Anyone remember the one-eyed veil? To Saudi scholars reading this, a little consistency please. Women get very easily confused. \u2724 And finally, the ever-excellent NPR carries a report on a Jewish American delegation freshly returned from Israel, where they went to oppose a bill in parliament. The group fears the bill would give Orthodox religious authorities in Israel the power to judge which conversions to Judaism are legitimate and therefore decide which converted Jews are eligible for Israeli citizenship. The story also pops up on the New York Times.

The raising of livestock such as cows, pigs and sheep occupies two-thirds of the world&apos;s farmland and generates 20% of all the greenhouse gases driving global warming. As a result, the United Nations and senior figures want to reduce the amount of meat we eat and the search is on for alternatives. A policy paper on the eating of insects is being formally considered by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. The FAO held a meeting on the theme in Thailand in 2008 and there are plans for a world congress in 2013. Professor Arnold van Huis, an entomologist at Wageningen University in the Netherlands and the author of the UN paper, says eating insects has advantages. &quot;There is a meat crisis,&quot; he said. &quot;The world population will grow from six billion now to nine billion by 2050 and we know people are consuming more meat. Twenty years ago the average was 20kg, it is now 50kg, and will be 80kg in 20 years. If we continue like this we will need another Earth.&quot; Van Huis is an enthusiast for eating insects but given his role as a consultant to the FAO, he can&apos;t be dismissed as a crank. &quot;Most of the world already eats insects,&quot; he points out. &quot;It is only in the western world that we don&apos;t. Psychologically we have a problem with it. I don&apos;t know why, as we eat shrimps, which are very comparable.&quot; The advantages of this diet include insects&apos; high levels of protein, vitamin and mineral content. Van Huis&apos;s latest research, conducted with colleague Dennis Oonincx, shows that farming insects produces far less greenhouse gas than livestock. Breeding commonly eaten insects such as locusts, crickets and meal worms, emits 10 times less methane than livestock. The insects also produce 300 times less nitrous oxide, also a warming gas, and much less ammonia, a pollutant produced by pig and poultry farming. Being cold-blooded, insects convert plant matter into protein extremely efficiently, Van Huis says. In addition, he argues, the health risks are lower. He acknowledges that in the west eating insects is a hard sell: &quot;It is very important how you prepare them, you have to do it very nicely, to overcome the yuk factor.&quot; More than 1,000 insects are known to be eaten by choice around the world, in 80% of nations. They are most popular in the tropics, where they grow to large sizes and are easy to harvest. The FAO&apos;s field officer Patrick Durst, based in Bangkok, Thailand, ran the 2008 conference. Durst helped set up an insect farming project FAO project in Laos which began in April. This involves transferring the skills of the 15,000 household locust farmers in Thailand across the border. &quot;There were some proponents of a bigger dairy industry in Laos to improve a calcium deficiency,&quot; says Durst, whose favourite is fried wasp - &quot;very crispy and a nice light snack&quot;. &quot;But this is crazy when most Asians are lactose intolerant.&quot; Locusts and crickets are calcium-rich and 90% of people in Laos have eaten insects at some point, he says.Durst says the FAO&apos;s priority will be to boost the eating of insects where this is already accepted but has been in decline due to western cultural influence. He also thinks such a boost can provide livelihoods and protect forests where many wild insects are collected. &quot;I can see a step-by-step process to wider implementation.&quot; First, insects could be used to feed farmed animals such as chicken and fish which eat them naturally. Then, they could be used as ingredients. Van Huis adds: &quot;We&apos;re looking at ways of grinding the meat into some sort of patty, which would be more recognisable to western palates.&quot; One of the few suppliers of insects for human consumption in the UK is Paul Cook, whose business Osgrow is based in Bristol. However, no matter how they are marketed or presented, Cook is not convinced they will ever become more than a novelty. &quot;They are in the fun element ... But I can&apos;t see it ever catching on in the UK in a big way.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 2 August 2010.

We&apos;re only there for a couple of days and want a decent base in the city. I&apos;ve heard that getting around can be a bit of a pain. We&apos;re not budget travellers - within reason.Clair Rogers There&apos;s no need to stay on the Khao San Road should you not wish to \u2013 especially if you can go into the mid-range or higher bracket. If time is short, then you&apos;ll probably want to stay as centrally as you can. Ko Ratanakosin, the royal island in the heart of the city and Thonburi, located just over the river, offer some interesting places to stay that are close to the main historic sites. Chakrabongese Villas (thaivillas.com; private villas from \u00a3156) are private dwellings set in the riverside gardens of a historic mansion. Another riverside option is the Ibrik Resort (ibrikresort.com; doubles from \u00a380), a white waterfront house over the river in Thonburi with just three rooms, which come with four-poster beds. You could lose yourself for two days in the historic temples and food markets of Ko Ratanakosin and traditional streets of Thonburi without having to do anything more strenuous than take a short river ferry journey. Should you seek to venture further, you&apos;ll find that the city&apos;s public transport is not as bad as you&apos;ve heard. Taxis are easy to find and cheap, though when travelling from Ko Ratanakosin to more modern areas of town the canal ferry will be faster and services are very frequent. The river ferries are also useful and cheap. Once around Siam Square, Silom and other newer parts of the city, Metro and Skytrain services make getting around easy. Tuk-tuks, though iconic, will involve a little bartering to get the fare right (40B or 80p for a short trip) and many find the reality of trundling through traffic in an open-sided vehicle is not the delightful experience it appears. Three of us have a week off from 10 September. We thought about going to Santorini, but then we noticed Berlin festival is on the 10 and 11 September. Berlin is my favourite city, I&apos;ve been five times and can sort out that part no bother. Where I could do with your help is \u2026 what happens next? We&apos;d probably be staying in Berlin for three nights, so after party times would look to leave on 13 September to find some sunshine and beach for a few more days (back to work in London 20 September). Greece/Greek islands would be good, but we&apos;re open to suggestions. How can we get a last-minute deal from Berlin back to London? Katie Johnston I can&apos;t offer any alchemy here I&apos;m afraid. These two trips won&apos;t combine easily unless you make the arrangements yourself. Cheap last-minute deals are usually for packages involving a return flight. You won&apos;t find any last-minute deal combined with a flight from Germany to Greece, then returning from Greece to the UK. A better bet is to look for accommodation-only deals in the Greek islands \u2013 lowcostholidays.com will give you an idea of what&apos;s available now. Costs should not increase for accommodation-only deals in September between now and the time of departure. Not sure which island to choose? Ben Mallalieu has written a useful primer to the most popular spots. You then need to check you can arrange two flights: from Berlin to the island of your choice and from there back to your closest UK base. Berlin Airports (berlin-airport.de) has a complete list of destinations from the German capital, and Wikipedia entries for regional airports retain lists of destinations which you should double-check. Then make use of Skyscanner and Cheap Flights. Bah humbug. My boyfriend and I want to get away from (not for!) Christmas this year. Is there anywhere we can go to get away from all the commercialised and religious festivities?\u00a0We&apos;d like to go away for a week or two, to anywhere in the world that won&apos;t cost the earth (we&apos;re normally budget travellers). We like to go off the beaten track, so resort hotels are a no-no.Lesley Middlemas, Edinburgh It&apos;s not easy to completely escape Christmas festivities, which are hard to avoid in most cities and towns around the world. However, you don&apos;t have to go further than north Africa - Morocco perhaps - to find a place where 25 December is just another day. It&apos;ll be a similar story throughout the Arabic-speaking world, especially when you get into more rural areas. Oman, easily accessible through the Emirates flight from Glasgow to Dubai and then a bus ride is another interesting option. Activity holidays tend to take you far away from the commercialised world so you may wish to consider taking a small group walking tour or other type of trip. Walks Worldwide (0845 301 4737; walksworldwide.com) have a 12-day Libyan Explorer trip leaving on 22 December visiting the Roman remains at Leptis Magna,\u00a0the rock art at Jebel Acacus and the Ubari Lakes costing \u00a31,395 including flights. I am planning a trip to Andalusia next year and will be getting there - and getting around - by train. I would love to go to Seville and Cadiz for the Easter celebrations. Do the train services run during Easter week and will it be possible to find accommodation in Cadiz or Seville at that time? Also, what public transport is available to get from Cadiz to Ca\u00f1os de Meca?JenoWl1 Trains services will run during Easter week, though services will be reduced to something akin to a Sunday service on public holiday dates. Easter is late next year -\u00a024 April is Easter Sunday. Spanish trains usually have a booking horizon of 60 days, so trains for Easter probably won&apos;t be available to book until the end of February. You can book via Rail Europe (0844 848 4070, raileurope.co.uk) but note that booking is unnecessary on local services. There will be a huge amount of pressure on accommodation in Seville, less so in Cadiz, but advance booking is still essential.\u00a0 Indeed, Cadiz&apos;s celebrations make a good alternative to visiting Seville if you can&apos;t find somewhere to stay. If city centre hotels are out of your price range \u2013 and many double their prices at this time of year \u2013 then you can investigate staying just outside the city, using hostels and homestays or camping.

The move, which was confirmed by UN officials at the UN climate talks in Bonn this week, matches demands made by the world&apos;s poorest countries for money to adapt to climate change. Saudi Arabia and some other Opec oil-producing countries claim that they will have to adapt their economies to a world which uses less oil and say they could lose as much as $19bn a year if countries are forced to cut fossil fuel use. Their argument is that they have only oil and sand as resources and it would be unfair to penalise them. Saudi Arabia first raised the idea of compensation for lost oil revenues at climate talks in Bangkok last year, in the run-up to the Copenhagen climate summit. The principle of compensation for countries economically or socially affected by climate change has been established in the UN talks, but there is deep unease that the country which first denied man-made climate change and has long fought a new climate agreement should benefit from money intended to help poor countries. Delegates from Aosis, the Alliance of Small Island States, this week said that it was &quot;absurd&quot; to allow Saudi Arabia to claim adaptation money. &quot;It goes against the spirit of the talks, which is to help the poor adapt to something they did not cause,&quot; said one diplomat who asked not to be named. &quot;Besides, the small pot of money expected to be made available [by rich countries] would be seriously diminished if countries like Saudi Arabia are allowed to claim,&quot; he said.

A number of countries have concluded that when it comes to selling their image and their goods to the British public, there is no more effective way to win hearts and minds than through the stomach. Taiwan has become the latest country to launch a diplomatic drive based around its national cuisine. President Ma Ying-jeou has ordered his envoys to start talking the language of food by launching a \u00a320m &quot;gastro-diplomacy&quot; campaign in the UK and elsewhere. Taiwan&apos;s consulate in London is hoping to make dishes such as &quot;stinky tofu&quot; and oyster omelette the stars of a diplomatic drive to differentiate the country from its giant and sometimes antagonistic neighbour, China, and to end the perception that Taiwan is little more than the mass-production workshop of the world. It is not alone. The Malaysian government will next month transform Trafalgar Square into a street food bazaar as part of a UK campaign fronted by chef Rick Stein. South Korea has pushed its culture through a programme of &quot;Kimchi&quot; diplomacy, particularly in the US. Kimchi refers to Korea&apos;s ubiquitous fermented vegetable pickle, and there has been a boom in Korean fast food trucks in California serving kimchi quesadillas. The ultimate goal for gastro-diplomats is to emulate the success of Thailand&apos;s 2002 &quot;Global Thai&quot; campaign, which increased the number of Thai restaurants around the world, making pad Thai and tom yum just as familiar a shorthand for Thailand as the hamburger is for America. Even North Korea is putting its best food forward: a chain of state-owned &quot;Pyongyang restaurants&quot; has spread to Cambodia, Bangkok, China and Laos, serving dishes such as ice-encrusted noodles and dog-meat soup, while waitresses sing and dance to North Korean songs. &quot;People feel warm around food,&quot; said Steve Chen, Taiwan&apos;s economic consul in London, over dumplings and bubble tea, a Taiwanese drink featuring chewy black pearls of tapioca and sweet potato starch which he hopes will become a hit with the UK&apos;s coffee drinking set. &quot;It touches your heart, and that is what we want. &quot;It is completely different to the image we have had as a centre of industrial production. Our most important job was to promote the hi-tech industries, but that is changing and the government in Taipei has decided that the food industry is the most important item to promote, because we need to make clear there is something unique about Taiwan.&quot; The food shown off by Chen at Old Tree, his favourite restaurant, in Golders Green, north London, is a fragrant fusion of Chinese, Japanese and Vietnamese cooking. There are hints of a more political intent, and one goal is to use food to ensure the world understands the difference between Taiwan and mainland China. Taiwan is often treated as wayward province by China. &quot;Taiwan has figured out it can do better outreach work through the kitchen table,&quot; said Paul Rockower, a visiting fellow at the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy, who is studying gastro-diplomacy. &quot;When someone tries a sea-salt latte [a Taiwanese drink] it creates awareness about Taiwanese culture. The Koreans embarked on Kimchi diplomacy partly because their brands weren&apos;t being recognised as Korean \u2013 Samsung was being recognised as a Japanese brand.&quot; Gastro-diplomacy can cause cultural indigestion, however. Old Tree&apos;s menu features a lot of pork, which has sparked complaints from the Jewish community in Golders Green, while Malaysia&apos;s year-long campaign, run by a British PR firm in London, has overwhelmed some food writers who, with five months still to go, have grown tired of being bombarded with offers of rich Malaysian food. The differences between Israel and Lebanon were exposed earlier this year when a &quot;hummus war&quot; erupted, with both sides vying to prepare the largest bowl of hummus to claim the world record. And during indirect peace talks between Israel and Syria, Syria&apos;s president, Bashir Assad, was rumoured to have had a plate of Damascus hummus delivered to then Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert. In 2005, France&apos;s pride in its world-famous cuisine may have cost it the right to host the 2012 Olympics. Jacques Chirac, then president, was reported as criticising British and Finnish food on the eve of the final IOC vote in which Finland had two votes and London was a candidate. &quot;You can&apos;t trust people who cook as badly as that,&quot; Chirac said, according to the newspaper Liberation. &quot;After Finland, [the UK] is the country with the worst food.&quot; Stinky tofu anyone?

Paul Cryne, a former bodyguard originally from Manchester, believed he would get away with the &quot;perfect murder&quot;. Having blown a fortune on a flamboyant lifestyle in Thailand, he was paid \u00a330,000 by Graham Birchwood, 54, to murder Sharon Birchwood, 52, at her bungalow in Ashstead, Surrey, in December 2007. Jailing Cryne, 62, for life after he was convicted of murder at the Old Bailey, Judge Jeremy Roberts said he must serve at least 28\u00bd years. &quot;You may well spend the rest of your life behind bars. If you do, I am afraid that will be the consequences of your own actions,&quot; said the judge. Birchwood stood to gain a \u00a3475,000 &quot;pot of gold&quot; from the will of his former wife, who had remained devoted to him despite their divorce in 1989. He had married his secretary, with whom he has two children. The court heard Birchwood was \u00a3150,000 in debt and facing bankruptcy. Realising he would fall under suspicion if she were murdered, he needed someone &quot;prepared to do such a deed without being noticed, who could disappear without even attracting the attention of police&quot;, said Mark Dennis, prosecuting. Cryne, who once set a world record for underwater swimming with scuba equipment, moved to Pattaya in the 1990s after receiving a \u00a3500,000 payout after a boat accident in the Maldives. After living the high life, the money ran out. He had accrued debts of \u00a311,000 when, through the expatriate community in Thailand, he was met and hired by Birchwood, who was jailed for life last year with a minimum term of 32 years. In 2005, Cryne was cleared by a Thai court of murdering another Briton, Robert Henry, who was shot six times, after prosecution witnesses failed to turn up for his trial. But it was a crime committed in Britain in 1972 \u2013 when he was convicted for holding a girlfriend hostage and jailed for seven years \u2013 that led to his arrest for this murder. Sharon Birchwood, who had ME, was strangled and left on her bed &quot;cruelly trussed-up&quot; with parcel tape and electrical cord, the Old Bailey heard. Cryne left few clues and flew back to Bangkok three hours after the killing. But DNA found at the scene matched that on a cup at Birchwood&apos;s mother&apos;s house where Cryne had briefly stayed. On the cup there were fingerprints, which were linked to his 1972 conviction. Detectives traced Cryne to Thailand and he was extradited. &quot;The police were able to unravel the plot, thereby frustrating the otherwise perfect murder,&quot; said Dennis. The judge described Sharon Birchwood&apos;s murder as the carefully planned execution of a vulnerable woman. &quot;One can only imagine the mental and physical suffering she must have undergone in the last few minutes of her life while you tightened that electrical cable around her neck until she was dead.&quot; Cryne was aware of Sharon Birchwood&apos;s devotion to her former husband, the judge said. &quot;You allowed yourself to become an instrument of his betrayal of her. You were in this together \u2013 he as the organiser and you as the hired killer.&quot; The court heard that Birchwood thought all he would have to do was &quot;keep a cool head&quot; and had delayed for three days before going to find the body and calling 999. He was standing outside with a cup of coffee when the ambulance arrived. Cryne, who boasted of his ability to incapacitate a person with one blow, turned to the jury as he was led away and said: &quot;Innocent man&quot;. Detective Chief Inspector Maria Woodall said: &quot;Sharon lived a quiet, harmless, ordinary lifestyle, burdened by ill-health and living in rather poor conditions with little social life and no known enemies. She was totally betrayed by the greed of the man she had married and been devoted to for 30 years. &quot;Birchwood made the callous decision that his ex-wife must die and then set about a ruthless plot which he hoped would distance himself from this evil crime. He involved Cryne as part of this devious plan.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-08-11T17:11:16Z", "tags": ["Crime", "UK news", "Thailand", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/aug/11/hitman-husband-divorcee-fortune-will", "title": "Life for hitman hired by husband to murder ex-wife for fortune in her will", "sentences": ["Cryne left few clues and flew back to Bangkok three hours after the killing."]}, {"article": "I was 22 when I joined the army. It was always an ambition and I believed the army was a force for good, helping developing nations become more stable. I\u00a0wanted to be involved in that. My first operation was Afghanistan in 2006. I&apos;d never even been on a\u00a0plane before, so everything felt new and exciting. We all wanted to get out there and prove ourselves. We were logistics specialists based in Kandahar, working with combat supplies. I remember one evening a rocket whistled overhead and hit. We came rushing out of our tent, and could see civilians lying on the ground. I was torn \u2013 I wanted to help, but we weren&apos;t allowed to leave our fortified camping area. Later, we dealt with the aftermath of\u00a0the Nimrod air crash, where faulty equipment caused the deaths of 14 people. I remember seeing all those coffins laid out and thinking, what a\u00a0pointless waste of life. On tour, you try to shove feelings of doubt to one side. But one day a\u00a0comrade said, &quot;Why are we here?&quot; and the question hung around. Nobody seemed to know. I suppose all young soldiers are naive. The culture of the army is obedience, and you believe your government has your best interests at heart. But when I returned home after seven months, I was determined not to be blind any more. I read about the history of the conflict and began to realise I had been duped. This wasn&apos;t a war about liberation, it was about strategic influence; about economics and mineral wealth. At the same time I started experiencing nightmares and anxiety caused by PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder]. I started drinking to get to sleep. I told the army, but I\u00a0didn&apos;t feel I was offered proper support. At least I knew I\u00a0wouldn&apos;t be going back to Afghanistan. I was protected by &quot;harmony&quot; guidelines \u2013 the 18-month gap between tours. I\u00a0decided to keep everything to myself and get on with my job, then sign off when I could. But after seven months, I was told I had to go back. I raised my objections with my commander and told him I didn&apos;t agree with the war. He called me a coward and said, &quot;You&apos;re a soldier, you go where you&apos;re told.&quot; By that time, we were on build-up training to go on tour, so I faced a stark choice. I booked a\u00a0cheap flight to Bangkok and left. My plan was to spend a month there, get some space and come home, but I fell apart. I started drinking and taking drugs, and drifted around Asia before ending up in Australia. It was there I met my wife and began to get myself back together. Eventually I called the awol hotline in the UK. I&apos;d been gone for a year and a half. It was such a\u00a0relief to talk after being silent for so long. Six months later we flew home. It was tense and strange going back to the army base. The next day, I was charged with going awol and put back in my old job. I didn&apos;t want to tell my colleagues what had happened, but when the army raised the charge to desertion \u2013 which can carry a sentence of up to 10 years \u2013 I\u00a0decided to make a stand. I spoke to the papers, and in front of 500 people at a Stop the War meeting. The army were shocked. They just kept promising me I&apos;d go to prison. The sentencing took nine months, and in the meantime I built up a case with my lawyers on the legality of the conflict. It was clear the army didn&apos;t want a public examination because, all of a sudden, the charges for desertion were dropped. In the end, I spent nine months in Colchester Military Corrective Training Centre. I had massive support inside. I remember this big, scary commando coming over. I thought, uh-oh. He said, &quot;You&apos;re that guy, aren&apos;t you? Good egg, good lad.&quot; What happened to me isn&apos;t unusual: 11,000 have gone awol since 2003, but the army keep it quiet. The public needs to know because they&apos;re paying for courts martial and military prisons. They need to know why people are refusing to fight. I&apos;ve found a real passion for antagonising the state, and I&apos;m going to keep at it. I&apos;m off to university to study International Relations with Peace and Conflict studies. After everything that&apos;s happened, I still love the army. I&apos;ll miss the banter and the culture. And I&apos;m proud of myself for joining up in the first place. I wanted to improve things, and went out to Afghanistan for all the right reasons. It&apos;s a shame these conflicts are being fought for all the wrong ones. \u2022 As told to Becky Barnicoat.

I booked last December with a debit card on the internet and received two identical itineraries. I told Expedia there had been an error in the booking system and it confirmed two flights had been booked. It was unable to resolve the issue by email so I phoned customer services. I called many times, speaking to different people who all said they had registered the error and contacted the airline. They agreed the case was clear cut and there would be a full refund of \u00a3399.84. I&apos;m still waiting. SW, London You were charged twice because two applications went through the website, even though you thought your first attempt failed. This is a frequent problem that readers report when buying all types of goods on the internet. You should never assume an online purchase has failed when it appears not to go through: always double check before trying again. Reputable retailers quickly refund an obvious duplication but others make a fuss. This causes particular problems with non-refundable flights.

Few are as important or, frankly, as indispensable as Carrier&apos;s Great Dishes of the World, which gently explained to a Britain for whom the memories of rationing were still fresh, that there really was a world of food beyond their shores. Carrier delivered fabulously detailed and uncompromising recipes for the likes of beef stroganoff and bouillabaisse. The writer&apos;s attention to detail , and commitment to getting it right, is obvious on every page and explains why the books has endured. Carrier, who died in 2006, continued to update Great Dishes, and it remained in print for years. Though the colour plates now have a certain kitsch quality there is no doubting its reach or ambition. As well as roaming far and wide across Europe there were also recipes from China, India, the Middle East and Caribbean. Even so there&apos;s no doubting that its heart really belongs to France. Jay Rayner 9 SICHUAN COOKERY Fuchsia Dunlop(Penguin, 2003)     Buy it    Before I had finished even half of Fuchsia Dunlop&apos;s introduction to her first cookbook, I was kicking myself for knowing so little about such a diverse and clearly delicious food region that&apos;s as big as France and more populous than Britain. Her entertaining descriptions of her time spent cooking in Chendung&apos;s famous cooking school combined with her simple, concise translations of what she learned made me yearn to start cooking immediately. I was in Chinatown a few days later, loading up on ingredients, though many are readily available in good supermarkets. The recipes veer from the incredibly simple, such as stir-fried potato slithers with chillies to the more elaborate, such as dry-braised fish with pork in spicy sauce. Clear chapters cover cold food, poultry, fish dishes and street food. The vegetable chapter includes a recipe for fish-fragrant aubergine that is so simple and yet so good that it would convert anyone to Sichuan food. Concise sections detail most common ingredients and different cooking methods. You&apos;re left aching to visit the region, just to learn more. Thomasina Miers 8 THE CLASSIC ITALIAN COOKBOOK Marcella Hazan(Papermac, 1973)     Buy it    Marcella Hazan often gets the blame for the craze for balsamic vinegar, and she has been known to complain people use it far too much. But in other matters, her influence has only ever been benign. Hazan, knowing that some pastas are most definitely not best made at home, has made cooks everywhere feel truly proud of their jars of dried spaghetti. She has also, down the years, encouraged them to chuck out their garlic presses, and use instead the blade of a knife to crush our cloves. Best of all, she has taught us to elevate what we used to call spaghetti sauce to the status of ragu, an altogether more sophisticated beast. We know now to add milk to it, and nutmeg and, if we are feeling really chi-chi, we can throw in some chicken livers, too, and call it &apos;ragu di fegatini&apos;. The Classic Italian Cookbook was published in 1973 in America, where Hazan taught cookery in her New York apartment. Then, in 1980, it was adapted for a British audience by Anna del Conte, at which point she won herself a whole lot of new fans, plus an Andre Simon Award. It is a very good book indeed: comprehensive, straightforward, with recipes that really work. If you want to know how to make proper risotto, minestrone, or lasagne, this is where to look. But it includes other delicious things, too: pot-roasted squab, stewed rabbit, braised oxtail. As Hazan notes, the Italians like to describe such dishes as &quot;un bocone da cardinale&quot;, or a &quot;morsel for a cardinal&quot;. We don&apos;t know too many cardinals, but we know what she means: this is gloriously tasty food, to be cooked for those you really love. Rachel Cooke 7 THAI FOOD David Thompson (Pavillion Books, 2002)     Buy it    Australian chef David Thompson first went to Thailand almost accidentally when some holiday plans fell through, and was smitten by the country and its food. He moved to Bangkok, where he studied in the kitchens of people skilled in the noble arts of traditional cookery, pored over the memorial books that documented palace recipes, and explored the food sold on the streets. He originally promised his publisher a small book on Thai snacks, disappeared for years of intensive and obsessive research, and finally came up with this remarkable and comprehensive study of Thailand&apos;s culinary traditions. (With characteristic irony, he mentions in his acknowledgments that writing it was &apos;an interesting, prolonged experience&apos;.) Within its gorgeous pink covers, you will find information cultural, geographical, historical, spiritual and culinary, not to mention a vast collection of recipes that range from street food through palace cooking, to exquisite desserts. It&apos;s a book of rare depth and complexity, demanding and exotic, and one that opened the door to a new appreciation of Thai cookery among readers of the English language. Fuchsia Dunlop 6 ENGLISH FOOD Jane Grigson(Ebury Press, 1974)     Buy it    The great Jane Grigson, the Observer&apos;s food writer from 1968 until her death in 1990, was also the author of many wonderful cookbooks. It&apos;s perhaps debatable which is the best of these, but the one for which she will always be most celebrated is English Food. As the critic Fay Maschler put it: &quot;She restored pride to the subject of English food and gave evidence that there is a valid regional quality still extant in this somewhat beleaguered cuisine.&quot; English Food (it contains recipes from Wales, too) is undoubtedly a work of scholarship: carefully researched, wide-ranging and extremely particular. But it is also contains hundreds of excellent recipes, the vast majority of them short, precise and foolproof. Who could resist poached turbot with shrimp sauce, or a properly made Cornish pasty? As for the puddings, Grigson delivers recipes for some of our favourite ever: Yorkshire curd tart, brown bread ice cream, queen of puddings, and Sussex pond pudding. There is also an excellent \u2013 and blissfully long \u2013 section on teatime: every possible cake and bun is here in all their sugary, buttery glory. Rachel Cooke 5 ROAST CHICKEN AND OTHER STORIES Simon Hopkinson with Lindsey Bareham(Ebury Press, 1994)     Buy it    Simon Hopkinson is not a great cook because of his mastery of technique, though he has that by the bucketful. Nor is it his flair for innovation that makes him; even he would say his food cleaves tightly to the great European traditions. What defines him is his exquisite good taste. Nowhere is that better demonstrated than in this cleanly written, utterly reliable, delicious book. It is organised by ingredient \u2013 A is for anchovy, B is for Brains, P is for pork pieces and bacon bits \u2013 with a short essay on each. Then come the recipes, be it the roast chicken of the title \u2013 the trick is to rub it with butter and then squeeze over the juice of a lemon \u2013 one of his beloved tripe stews, or his saffron mash, pretty much the only dish he claims as his own invention. Pleasingly there is a direct link in this book back to the great Elizabeth David with recipes that she first introduced to these shores, such as the saffron soup with mussels or the heart stopping St \u00c9milion au chocolat, refined for a modern palate. Jay Rayner 4 KITCHEN DIARIES Nigel Slater (4th Estate, 2005)     Buy it    Nigel Slater is the Philip Roth of food. The towering writer of his generation by whom all others are judged. Or simply &quot;a bloody genius&quot;, according to Jamie Oliver. Real Fast Food is Slater&apos;s Portnoy&apos;s Complaint, the bold and brilliant arrival, packed with precocious appetites and ideas, that changed for ever the thought of what to do with food in the cupboard or fridge. But Kitchen Diaries is the full flowering of a mature talent, with a clear knowledge of who he is, where he comes from and what he wants to say. Moving on from Richard Olney&apos;s defining understanding of seasonality, Diaries places food back in the heart of the British home, the garden, the market, the farm. &quot;Roast rhubarb on a January morning; pick-your-own strawberries in June; a piece of chicken on a grill on an August evening; a pot-roast pigeon on a damp October afternoon.&quot; The concept was simple but game-changing. British food from now on would celebrate the right food at the right time. Open it on any page (but start, say, with 1 January on page 4) and savour the simple beauty of the recipes and the writing. Allan Jenkins 3 THE BOOK OF JEWISH FOOD Claudia Roden(Penguin, 1996)     Buy it    Cairo-born Roden has published many great recipe books, and there are few who can touch her knowledge of the Mediterranean and Middle East. But it is The Book Of Jewish Food which will stand as her masterpiece. In truth it is less a cookbook than a cultural over view of the entire Jewish diaspora, with appropriate recipes attached. It is a mark of just how reliable a piece of scholarship it is that, on publication, it was greeted with almost universal acclaim; a rare achievement for any work wading into the notoriously rancorous Jewish community. Every page and, more important, every recipe bursts with the vigour of a people that spent 2,000 years on the move. The dishes of the Sephardic Jews of North Africa and Spain are as rich and varied as you would expect of a writer who made her name with the food of the Middle East. Here are instructions for Iraqi date-filled pies, Tunisian couscous cakes and quinces in wine. More compelling still is her codifying of the eastern European Ashkenazi tradition: her irrefutable instructions for perfect chopped liver, latkes, gefilte fish and the rest. Any edition of this book is a joy, but the beautifully illustrated American version, published by Knopf, is particularly special. Jay Rayner 2 FRENCH PROVINCIAL COOKING Elizabeth David (Penguin, 1960)     Buy it    Elizabeth David came to me somewhat late, in cookery calendar terms. My mother, a very good cook indeed, had not, to my knowledge, a book of hers anywhere in the house when I was fettling away at the Aga in my early to late teens. Cordon Bleu, yes. Dad&apos;s dog-eared EP Veerasawmy paperback for his curries, indeed. But no Elizabeth David. It was not until I was 21 years old when friends in West Wales gave me a set of her Penguin paperbacks for my birthday, hoping that they may further inspire me in the kitchen of my little restaurant by the sea. Although I had already worked in a French restaurant and eaten in France with my parents, nothing compared to that which I was to learn and devour from French Provincial Cooking. Nothing had previously evoked such a sense of place and time with the richest prose. It was and remains, intoxicating. The recipe for poitrine d&apos;agneau Sainte M\u00e9n\u00e9hould is a case in point, where this meagre, though supremely flavoursome joint, is quietly poached with aromatics, cooled, carefully divested of its flacid, corset-like bones and excess fat, it is then pressed between weighted plates, or some such. Once firm, this now flat cut is sliced into thick strips, smeared with mustard, beaten egg and coated with breadcrumbs. Gently grilled, or fried till crisp \u2013 not &apos;crispy&apos;, a description Elizabeth David abhorred. This is a remarkably good plate of food. Simon Hopkinson 1 THE FRENCH MENU COOKBOOK Richard Olney(Ten Speed Press, 1970)     Buy it    On a summer afternoon at his home in Provence in 1999, the American food writer Richard Olney went to lie down after a light lunch, and never woke up. He was 72, and had led an interesting and fulfilling life (his friends included the writer James Baldwin, the poet John Ashbery, and the painter John Craxton). He had also, unlike many people, been able to cook his own last meal. The story goes that when his brothers arrived to arrange the funeral, they found a plate and a glass by the sink. The plate contained traces of a tomato pilaff; the glass, red wine. The remaining pilaff was in the fridge. The brothers took it out, heated it up, and toasted him before tucking in. This pilaff tells you everything you need to know about Olney. People favour risottos now, but before there was risotto, there was pilaff: buttery rice mixed with onions, garlic and tomatoes that have first been fried in olive oil. If the tomatoes are good and fresh, the oil sufficiently grassy, and the onions just so, this is the food of the gods. Olney was a hugely accomplished and knowledgeable cook, but his mantra was simplicity and, in this sense, he was ahead of the times. When The French Menu was first published in 1970, its determinedly seasonal approach was considered revolutionary. Four years later, he published Simple French Food, and his reputation was sealed. Some read Olney for his uncompromising style alone. His sentences are longer than a prize pike; his salads are &quot;composed&quot;, not tossed. Others like the way he pairs every dish with a wine. But it&apos;s his menus that really slay you. Olney lived alone, but he was a generous host, and his friends must have considered themselves truly lucky. Imagine a friend who cooked you sorrel soup, followed by frito misto, pheasant salmis with ceps, and an orange jelly. Or crayfish mousse, ravioli of chicken breast, roast leg of venison and moulded coffee custard. Or, perhaps best of all, cucumber salad, baked lobster, braised and roasted partridge, and fresh figs with raspberry cream. With this raspberry cream, we quietly rest our case.

The 43-year-old Russian, who has maintained his innocence throughout two years in a maximum security prison in Thailand, will continue to fight the US&apos;s extradition request. His lawyer said he would lodge a petition with the Thai government asking it to block the extradition. &quot;The defence believes Bout will not be safe in the US and he will not receive a fair trial,&quot; Lak Nittiwattanawichan said outside court. The Thai government is not compelled to extradite Bout, but is almost certain to, given the high profile of the defendant, and strong American pressure. If he is not extradited within three months, he must be released. Bout has been in jail since March 2008, when he was arrested in a five-star Bangkok hotel in a joint US-Thai sting operation. Government agents posed as arms buyers for the Colombian rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc). According to the US grand jury indictment, Bout told the agents he could supply them with 700-800 surface-to-air missiles, more than 5,000 AK-47s and millions of rounds of ammunition, as well as C4 explosive, landmines and unmanned aerial drones. Bout was indicted on four charges, including conspiracy to kill US nationals and conspiracy to provide material support to a proscribed terrorist group. The US and UN have claimed Bout, a former Soviet air force officer, has been a weapons trafficker since the 1990s, using a fleet of cargo plans to move arms to Africa, Central America and the Middle East. He is alleged to have brokered weapons deals in Afghanistan, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Sudan, and to have armed the forces of the Liberian dictator Charles Taylor and Libya&apos;s Muammar Gaddafi. The 2005 movie Lord of War, starring Nicolas Cage, is loosely based on the Russian&apos;s life. Bout, who maintains he has never traded in weapons, told his trial he ran a legitimate air cargo business and was in Thailand to discuss selling aircraft to Thais. Last August, a Thai court ruled Bout should not be extradited because Farc was not a terrorist group but a political one. The appeals court today overturned that decision, saying Farc was a proscribed terrorist organisation and that Thailand was obliged to extradite Bout in accordance with treaties with the US. Prosecutors brought six new charges against Bout yesterday, including money laundering and electronic fraud. Those charges will be heard in a US court. Thailand has been under intense pressure from both US and Russia over Bout&apos;s case. The US state department summoned the Thai ambassador this week &quot;to emphasise how important this judgment is&quot;, a department spokesman, Philip Crowley, said. The Obama administration has previously cited Bout&apos;s arrest as an example of co-operation and trust between the two countries. The Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, discussed Bout&apos;s case with his Thai counterpart, Kasit Piromya, during a meeting in Hanoi last month, saying the drawn-out appeal process was &quot;beginning to raise questions&quot; and expressing, pointedly, &quot;the hope that Thai justice will not be subject to any pressure&quot;. &quot;We regret this \u2026 unlawful, political decision,&quot; Lavrov said today during a visit to Armenia, adding that Moscow believed the ruling was made &quot;under very strong external pressure&quot; and would continue to seek Bout&apos;s return to Russia. Bout, dressed in prison-issue shorts and shirt, and manacled in leg irons, hung his head and cried as the verdict was read out. He hugged his wife and daughter before being whisked away by guards. He did not speak, but his wife, Alla, said the Thai justice system had bowed to US lobbying. &quot;This is the result of constant pressure from the US government,&quot; she said in the courtroom, before breaking down in tears. &quot;This is an unfair decision because the initial court already said it&apos;s a political case.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-08-20T10:21:39Z", "tags": ["Arms trade", "US news", "Russia", "Thailand", "Colombia", "Viktor Bout", "Europe", "Americas", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/20/viktor-bout-extradited-us-thailand", "title": "Suspected Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout to be extradited to US", "sentences": ["Bout has been in jail since March 2008, when he was arrested in a five-star Bangkok hotel in a joint US-Thai sting operation."]}, {"article": "Cycling to India When I was 11, during a junior school leavers&apos; assembly in front of all the mums and dads, my headmistress asked my class what they wanted to do when they left school. Footballer, doctor, film star, politician, came the replies. My answer? &quot;I want to cycle round the world and raise money for charity.&quot; A big &quot;ahhhhh&quot; resounded around the school hall. &quot;So sweet.&quot; Little did they know that 20 years later I would be setting off on a 9,000-mile journey to India. On my own. Carrying everything I needed on my steel-framed bicycle, affectionately known as &quot;Shirley&quot;. I would like to say it was planned to the nth degree and that everything ran like clockwork. In reality, I was arrested twice, chased by wild dogs, beaten (and wined and dined) by the mafia, attacked by bandits \u2026 On my last day I was cycling through the Bandipur wildlife park in southern India. My flowery bike wasn&apos;t great camouflage and startled a number of elephants as I passed. They decided to charge. The advice is &quot;if an elephant charges you, stand your ground, and bow your head to show respect&quot;. What tosh! With 30 tonnes of muscle and bone crashing towards me, destroying small trees and making the ground vibrate under my feet, there was no way I was standing firm. I dropped my bike into third gear and floored it. Another time I ran out of food and water in the desert and was woken one morning to find maggots in my hair and beard. Yet the greatest memories are of so many wonderful people I met in every country, who invited me into their homes to celebrate local festivals, play music, dance, sing, eat, and share each other&apos;s cultures, beliefs, history and way of life. After six months&apos; cycling, I rolled into Chembakolli, a tiny village, my final destination. It was my 31st birthday \u2013 20 years since I had first dreamed up the idea. I was greeted by a carnival of people playing drums, singing, cheering, and waving banners saying &quot;Happy birthday&quot;. All I could do was crouch down and cry tears of joy. I&apos;d cycled 9,000 miles from England to India. I&apos;d lived my dream.Daniel Bent, 31, teacher, Essex. See his blog at mrbent.blogspot.com  Conservation protest camp in Tasmania I was on a year out in Australia, and after a few months in the red centre I decided to go to Tasmania to escape the heat, and to see big trees. The island is home to a vast forest of Eucalyptus regnans, the largest flowering plants in the world. Within a few days of arriving I heard word of protest activity in the Upper Florentine Valley, a pristine corner of virgin forest under threat from various logging projects. I decided to hitch there, and for the last part of the journey I rode with TK, a Canadian biologist who had been living at the Florentine camp for two years. He gave me a brief history of the area as we entered the forest. These Eucalyptus regnans, at 60m tall, may not be the biggest trees in the world \u2013 one California redwood is 98m, for example \u2013 but never, TK assured me, would I feel as dwarfed by nature as when among the giants of the Florentine Valley. The protest has been going on since 2006, when Forestry Tasmania began extending the road into the forest. Protesters live in the trees so that they won&apos;t be cut down, though there has been much confrontation and some arrests. &quot;Don&apos;t ever go in there,&quot; TK said as we passed a lonely, redbrick pub. &quot;If they think you look like one of us \u2013 a week or so at the camp should do it \u2013 they&apos;ll kick the shit out of you.&quot; The local climate is incredibly wet, adding a ghostly white cover to the giant trees. Rain-soaked banners high up in the branches \u2013 &quot;Toot for Tassy&apos;s Forests&quot;, &quot;Still Wild, Still Threatened&quot; \u2013 were visible from the roadside. But no amount of neck-craning can quantify the trees&apos; size. For an eco-friendly backpacker, the Florentine camp provided a cheap and exciting alternative to a volunteer project. Bring food donations, good conversation and a useful pair of hands and the vast Tasmanian wilderness is yours to explore. Camp life was centred on communal meals, firewood runs, clean-ups and lookout reports. Each night, wet hair and cloth steamed by a campfire under a blue tarpaulin. Plates of food were passed around \u2013 curried baked beans topped with fresh parsley. A camp veteran of six months told me how she was humbled by a spectacular light display from the aurora australis. Another veteran had a doctorate in zoology, and used the camp as a base for a statistical project on the Tasmanian devil population. I spent a couple of days on the west coast&apos;s Bay of Fires \u2013 a wild, windswept clash of white-sand beaches, turquoise water, brooding skies and red-stained granite rocks. As well as being a good place to become actively involved in forest conservation, the camp was where people shared travellers&apos; tips \u2013 a valuable resource that is often ignored in favour of a guidebook.Clyde Macfarlane, 23, anthropology graduate/freelance writer, Chichester. See Still Wild Still Threatened (stillwildstillthreatened.org) for details of the campaign  A year in Saudi Arabia Yearnings for the bamboo forests of China, the ski slopes of Switzerland and the karaoke booths of Japan \u2013 highlights of my previous gap years \u2013 don&apos;t surprise me, but I never imagined the minarets of Saudi Arabia would call me back. It is two years since I returned from Jeddah, but when I close my eyes on a grey English day I&apos;m walking the city&apos;s ancient streets again, seeking out Bukhari chicken or Egyptian flat bread. Money was my motivation for going to a country famous for exporting oil and terrorism; it has some of the best paid English teaching jobs in the world, and I managed to save \u00a38,500 in just six months working at a boys&apos; school there. I chose my new home city carefully. As the gateway to Mecca, through which the Muslim world passes on the hajj, the port of Jeddah is Saudi Arabia&apos;s most cosmopolitan and liberal city. My new Saudi friends warned me against even visiting the capital Riyadh, home of Wahhabism. In Jeddah I knew Saudis, as well as western women, who walked the streets unaccompanied by a man and with their heads uncovered, something they could never do in Riyadh. Jeddah also boasts some of the world&apos;s best coral reefs. Diving on the Saudi side of the Red Sea offers the same underwater riches as the Egyptian Sinai, but without the crowds. On the downside, I didn&apos;t speak to a woman for my first two months there, but I eventually found a private beach where the sexes could mix. My first lesson on a jetski was fleeing the coastguard. A Palestinian girl had taken me for a ride when we saw their ship approaching. For fear of being caught together we hid in a cove. Women are barred from driving any kind of motorised vehicles so I had to take the controls and when they passed we sped out of the cove and back to the beach James-Bond style. Bizarre experiences inform my anecdotes about Saudi Arabia \u2013 gate-crashing a wedding and ending up on stage in front of 2,000 guests, my Saudi girlfriend&apos;s mother catching us at my apartment together \u2026 But what I long for is visiting the crumbling, centuries-old buildings of Old Jeddah, smoking shisha in coffeshops and sipping sweet Adeni tea with a friend. The kingdom is a harsh place, but the people who live there are the most hospitable I&apos;ve ever met. I went for the riyals but came back richer in so many other ways.David Trayner, 29, news reporter, Leicester  Finding my own volunteer work and inspiration in Asia In October 2008 two friends and I started our gap year in Thailand. We began in Bangkok, where we shopped non-stop on Khao San Road, then moved to Koh Samui to learn Muay Thai kickboxing, and up to Pai for yoga and massage courses. We went across to Laos for cooking lessons, and it was here that I went into a school and helped with English lessons. I&apos;d always been put off volunteering by the idea of having to pay a company to work for nothing, but this was free. We moved onto Vietnam, and back to marathon shopping, but I just wasn&apos;t feeling it. I&apos;d got a taste for doing something &quot;better&quot; and I wanted to do more of it. So I left my mates and went ahead to Cambodia. The day I arrived I found an HIV orphanage called House of Family, where I volunteered. I asked the doctor what happened to all the other orphans \u2013 there were only 30 kids at the orphanage but the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Cambodia is among the highest in Asia. She explained that they were living at the rubbish dumps, so that is where I went. I discovered children eating dirt, sleeping on dirt and walking barefoot on burning toxic waste. It was inhumane and unacceptable. So I came back to England, borrowed a video camera, raised \u00a31,000 on Facebook and returned two weeks later to do the first Small Steps project. I gave wellington boots, clothes aid, food and water to the children. Then I came home, edited the film, screened it and got an amazing reaction from the public. I registered Small Steps as a charity and intend to repeat the project \u2013 called Around The World in 80 Dumps \u2013 on inhabited dumps around the world, to create awareness and help people. I am now the director of Small Steps, the next project is in Nicaragua. Amy Hanson, 30, London. If you are interested in volunteering for a Small Steps project (smallsteps.org), especially if you are a medic, contact info@smallstepsproject.org Hitchhiking to Israel After spending 32 tedious hours on a coach last summer, I was considering giving up overlanding. But as I sat in front of the easyJet website this summer I couldn&apos;t quite bring myself to double the size of my carbon footprint for the year with just one click. Instead, I decided I&apos;d rely on my thumb and the kindness of strangers and take a risk on that most controversial form of transport, particularly for women: the hitchhike. A friend would accompany me as far as Zagreb, then I&apos;d go on alone to Israel, through Turkey, Syria and Jordan. Three hours after posting a request on the website Gumtree (gumtree.com) we had a lift from Hounslow East in London to Mannheim in southern Germany. A week and three lifts later, we were couchsurfing (couchsurfing.org) in Berlin. We became pros at working service stations, asking every car that pulled in whether they had space for two travellers: &quot;You go?&quot; \u2026 point at map, smile, get in. There were BMWs, a limousine and a Slovenian rocking out to Pink Floyd. In some cars, especially after a night spent camping just off the hard-shoulder, my head would droop and 12 hours later I&apos;d wake to realise I&apos;d missed an entire country (sorry Slovakia, Bulgaria and northern Israel), but the further east I went, the more unfamiliar the scenery became and the more often my eyes would stay open. Even the worst experience could turn into a high point. We were dropped just north of Munich in the rain as it was getting dark, and were stuck for two hours, soaking wet, our spirits low. A couple in a people-wagon finally saved the day. They planned to drop us at a service station where we could hitch a lift into Austria. We talked and joked about small things \u2013 the scenery, the baptism that they&apos;d been to. I told them about my year as a parish administrator and the reverence that the baptism register commanded. By the end of that conversation they had decided I was a girl with an unambiguous calling who had put faith on hold to struggle against climate change. It turned out the man was a Protestant priest, and rather than drop us at a service station to pitch our tent in the rain, they offered us a night in their spare flat in the Bavarian mountains \u2013 hot water, fresh towels, beds all to ourselves, and for free \u2013 bliss. I spent over a month in the Middle East and saw sights that the guidebooks are yet to discover. Relying on the famed Syrian kindness, I was taken in, fed and cared for by a family for four days. They then drove me most of the three hours to Mar Musa monastery, enjoyed by few travellers. In Israel I lost myself in the carefree parties of Tel Aviv, making friends with kids who&apos;d just finished military service (&quot;Who cares about peace? We just want peace of mind&quot;). The next day I went to Jerusalem to yell in protest with the activists in the West Bank. I was given access to both worlds, the only condition that I would listen to the stories that they told about the other side. And it was this necessity to listen that made my decision to hitchhike so much more than just a cheap way to travel. Each was an invitation to get close to someone. Hitchhiking is the start of a story where anything might happen. You escape the check-in queue and have faith in the moment, in people and yourself. You begin a story with each person you meet. Living another person&apos;s life, if only for one journey, will teach you more about their culture than any guidebook.Tamsin Omond, 25, environmental campaigner, London. Follow her @tamsinomond on twitter Working on a farm in Scotland For many of my generation, the gap year between school and university was spent volunteering in orphanages or sunning on an Aussie beach. Being pretentious but poor I decided instead that my fate lay on a Scottish island. I had been to Mull on holiday and figured I would spend my days wandering the beach, reading epic novels and having flings with strapping farmers. I was a troubled teenager, desperate to escape the woes of life in a remote Kentish village, terrifyingly clueless about my career path. When I told her my plans, my mother, somewhat spitefully, said, &quot;How on earth are you going to do that?&quot;, which galvanized me into asking the tourist office if there were any friendly farmers. Fortune had it that I managed to speak to a girl called Claire, a conversation that changed my life. Claire knew of just the man, a farmer in the south of Mull who periodically &quot;took in&quot; young folk like me to help out on his 22,000 acres. Our brief phone call (he had an impossibly posh accent) went something like this: &quot;Have you ever worked on a farm?&quot; &quot;Erm, nope.&quot; &quot;Know anything about farming?&quot; &quot;Nope&quot; &quot;Are you fit?&quot; &quot;Not particularly&quot; &quot;I like your chutzpah. I&apos;ll pay your coach fare. If we like you, you can stay.&quot; I stepped off the ferry in cropped, dyed red hair, round glasses, ripped jeans and Dr. Marten boots, prompting the farmer to squint at me in disbelief and ask if I was a punk. Lochbuie \u2013 where I lived \u2013 is a 17-house village, beautiful and appealing to holidaying wildlife lovers, archaeologists and photographers. Sites include the uninhabited 15th-century Moy Castle and the impressive (inhabited) 18th-century Lochbuie House, overlooking the loch. Mull remains one of the most beautiful, unspoilt places in the UK. I returned recently and nothing had changed. I hated it for the first few weeks. But the farmer and his wife persevered through my astonishing ignorance about the world and I went from self-obsessed teenager who&apos;d never done a day&apos;s work in her life (bar the sort that you could give up if you didn&apos;t like it) to a useful (ish) member of the community. I emerged at the end of the experience fitter, fatter, better-read and able to sleep. Hazel Davis, 33, journalist, Huddersfield Family gap year We lived in Cornwall in a beautiful barn conversion with stunning valley views and only a short drive to the glorious Atlantic coast: my wife Nicki, with a beauticians business in Wadebridge, 15-year-old Michael, addicted to Xbox games, Emmaline, 13 going on 19, and me, John, full-time artist. Wanting to see the world had been nagging at me for years. In the end we decided to just do it. The kids could be schooled as we travelled and the experiences they&apos;d get would be possibly life-changing \u2013 hell, we might even find somewhere better to live than Cornwall. Having sold everything to fund the trip we had just three weeks to prepare, decide where to go and buy our round-the-world tickets: we opted for Japan, south-east Asia, Australia, New Zealand, a stop in the Cook islands and finally the United States. The furthest we&apos;d ever been prior to this was Bulgaria. We flew to Tokyo the day after Boxing Day, and stayed with a family in rural Japan, eating sushi with them each day and trying to communicate with gesticulations and props \u2013 sake seemed to help the conversations somewhat. Dressed in traditional kimono and samurai we visited Buddhist and Shinto temples on New Year&apos;s Day. We went on to learn to dive in Thailand, helped out at a charitable school in Cambodia, camped in the Australian outback and skied in August in New Zealand. But constantly moving on every few days can be exhausting, especially for kids, so sometimes we&apos;d just slob and watch DVDs in a rented apartment. The experiences have been so many and varied, and has been highly rewarding for the whole family. We&apos;ll have plenty of stories to &quot;entertain&quot; our friends and relatives at Christmas when we return in December.John Tregembo, 52, Cornwall. See his travel blog at johntregembo.co.uk.

You can go from east to west, or vice versa, but it&apos;s not possible to back-track. Most tickets have mileage limitations, usually around 25,000-30,000 miles. Prices of a basic ticket are often not much more expensive than a standard return to Australia; generally, the more stopovers you wish to make the more expensive the ticket. Most tickets are valid for 12 months from your first date of travel, with set departure dates for each leg. You can however change your dates for a small fee (STA Travel charges a flat \u00a335 fee). A good place to start is Roundthe worldflights.com (020-7704 5700), which allows you to search and compare thousands of flights using an interactive map, with fares from about \u00a31,000 for six stops. STA Travel (0800 988 7470, statravel.co.uk/gap) says one of its most popular \u2013 and cheapest \u2013 tickets is UK to Bangkok, overland to Singapore, fly to Darwin, overland to Sydney, fly to Auckland in New Zealand, fly to San Francisco, overland to New York and back to the UK, which starts from \u00a3739. Also check out Trailfinders (020-7938 3939, trailfinders.com/around-the-world) and Flight Centre (0844 815 7100, flightcentre.co.uk). Trains An epic train route can make a trip, or is a real alternative to air travel. In Europe, it still makes sense to buy an InterRail pass (interrailnet.com), which allows you unlimited travel in your chosen countries on as many days as you choose to cover; for example, a one-month Global Pass, covering 30 European countries, costs from \u00a3329. For travel in the US, Amtrak (amtrak.com) is a useful booking website, covering more than 500 destinations in 46 states. A 15-day pass costs $389 (half price for children) The Trans-Siberian has long been a favourite for gappers. Start at London St Pancras, on the Eurostar, then connect with a Cologne-Moscow direct sleeper taking two nights (from \u00a3200 one-way for London-Moscow with sleeper). The journey proper from Moscow to Beijing costs $450 one-way with a berth. (You&apos;ll also need to buy visas for Belarus, Russia, China and possibly Mongolia.) &quot;The most popular option is to travel from Russia to China, using one of two weekly Moscow-Beijing trains, or stopping off to explore using other trains in Russia,&quot; says rail travel guru Mark Smith, founder of The Man in Seat Sixty-One (seat61.com), which gives information on rail travel all over the world. From there, some go on by ferry to Japan, or take the twice-weekly train from Beijing to Hanoi in Vietnam. &quot;Singapore-Bangkok is one of the most popular pages on my website,&quot; Smith says. &quot;The luxurious Eastern &amp; Oriental Express runs weekly and costs over \u00a3900 but gappers can do the same 1,249-mile, 48-hour journey on daily scheduled trains for a mere \u00a340, including sleepers. Stopovers at Kuala Lumpur and Penang in Malaysia and southern Thailand are easy \u2013 ferries also link Surat Thani on the rail route to the beach island of Koh Samui.&quot; Vietnam is becoming increasingly popular, adds Smith: &quot;You can take the train from Saigon to Nha Trang to Danang (for Hoi An), on via the scenic Hai Van Pass along the coast and over the mountains to Hue (Perfume River trips and visits to the demilitarised zone), then Hanoi. Saigon-Hanoi takes two nights.&quot; Bus and truck Many areas of the world now have hop-on, hop-off bus services for backpackers, which are easy to use, good for meeting other travellers and getting travel advice. The Feejee Experience (+679 672 5950, feejeeexperience.com) circuits Fiji&apos;s Viti Levu island, stopping off at small rural villages. Valid for up to 12 months, the Hula Loop pass (from \u00a3208) includes free activities such as sandboarding down the Sigatoka sand dunes, a trek through the Namosi rainforest, and rafting down the Wainibuka river. The bus also stops at schools and communities where travellers are welcome to volunteer with teaching or building projects. In South Africa, the Baz Bus runs in both directions from Johannesburg to Cape Town, via the Drakensburg mountains or Swaziland, and taking in the Garden Route and Sunshine Coast, linking more than 180 hostels in 40 towns and cities, often dropping you at the door. Travellers buy a time-based or distance-based ticket to their final destination, and can hop on and off as often as they like (from \u00a3110 for a seven-day ticket; +27 21 422 5202, bazbus.com). &quot;I&apos;ve met people of all nationalities and ages on these buses, not just gap-year students or party-seekers,&quot; said Katie Monk, a travel writer and regular user. STA Travel (as before) already has its own hop-on, hop-off bus routes operating in Australia, Canada and South America, and is planning to launch more routes this year in the Northern Pass in China, and also Laos. This will be Lao&apos;s first flexible bus network for travellers in the country and can be joined from Bangkok (but its purpose is not to explore Thailand). Both routes will be bookable from September; prices yet to be confirmed \u2013 keep an eye on the STA Travel website. If you don&apos;t want to struggle with all the getting on and off the bus, look at operators that arrange overland group adventures. Dragoman (01728 861133, dragoman.com) takes a group on their own special bus on journeys from six days to 47 weeks, right across the globe, providing activities and accommodation along the way. For example, departing 29 December, a 119-day trip from Cairo to Cape Town costs \u00a34,370, plus \u00a32,030 kitty. Intrepid (020-3147 7777, intrepidtravel.com) has similar trips, including a 79-day Quito to Rio de Janeiro trip leaving on 16 December for \u00a32,445 (plus \u00a31,480 kitty). Other operators include oasisoverland.co.uk, kumuka.com, africantrails.co.uk, onthegotours.com and oz-bus.com (overland from London all the way to Australia). Ridesharing is increasingly popular with backpackers. Websites such as liftsurfer.com in New Zealand, gumtree.com and rideshare.co.uk, connect lift seekers with lift providers, the idea being that they share the cost of petrol and perhaps the driving on long trips, and that it is a safer version of hitchhiking. Working abroad You can teach English in almost any country in the world, often earning decent money and sometimes with free accommodation, paid holiday and even money towards your flights thrown in too. Many schools insist on a formal qualification, and it will make it much easier to bag a job \u2013 see tefl.com for how to train. See jobsabroadbulletin.co.uk, seasonworkers.com and teachabroad.com, for vacancies in destinations from Brazil to Bulgaria. For ski season work, natives.co.uk has an extensive database of jobs in Europe, from chalet hosts to chefs. For the US, check coolworks.com; seasonal-jobs.com and seasonworkers.com, which list ski jobs available across the globe. Freeradicals.co.uk also recruits for ski companies in Europe and America. Keep an eye on tour operators&apos; websites, too: for example markwarner-recruitment.co.uk and firstchoice4jobs.co.uk. In Europe, Australia and New Zealand, picking fruit is an obvious way to earn extra cash. The work is flexible but can be physically demanding and you usually get paid according to the amount of fruit you pick. In most places you can earn about \u00a3150 a week and farms often let you camp on site or provide hostel accommodation. See fruitpicking.org and pickingjobs.com for listings. For details of the Australian working holiday visa, visit australia.com/workingholiday. If you&apos;re in Sydney and struggling to find work, check into Sydney Beachouse YHA (sydneybeachouse.com.au from AUS$27 per night). The hostel is so sure it can get guests work it is offering two nights&apos; accommodation free (out of five) if its employment service doesn&apos;t find you a job. Accommodation Increasingly a hit with backpackers, couchsurfing.com connects travellers with people willing to host them in their spare rooms or on the sofa for nothing \u2013 it has 600,000 members around the world. Similar services include globalfreeloaders.com, hospitalityclub.org and stay4free.com. Homestays are another great way for backpackers to immerse themselves in the local culture. While some remain simple room-and-a-meal experiences, others offer extras, such as cooking lessons or trekking tours, with your host acting as guide, interpreter and confidant. Mahindra Homestays (020-3140 8422, mahindrahomestays.com) has options throughout India; staying with a family in a posh residential neighbourhood of Jaipur in October costs \u00a335 a night, and your hosts will take you on sightseeing trips. Other companies that offer homestays are Tribes (01728 685 971, tribes.co.uk), Responsible Travel (01273 600030, responsibletravel.com), Intrepid (020-3147 7777, intrepidtravel.com) and South American Experience (0845 277 3366, southamerican experience.co.uk). Useful websites include homestayweb.com and villagehomestays.com. If you&apos;re willing to work for your board and keep, try WWOOF (wwoof.org.uk), which offers volunteering schemes on organic farms all over the world, and Workaway (workaway.info), which sets up all sorts of work placements, many with adventure operators, wilderness lodges and hotels (in amazing locations), where you spend a few hours a day doing basic tasks in return for food and board. Money Insurance You need insurance. Fixing a broken leg can cost a whopping \u00a322,000-plus in the US, for example. Shop around. A search on moneysupermarket.com for a backpacker and long-trip policy providing 12 months&apos; worldwide cover for an 18-year-old male (excluding winter sports cover), for example, turned up almost 40 policies, most offering broadly the same cover but varying in price from \u00a3110 to \u00a3435. Note that insurers may not provide cover if you plan to travel to a country if the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office (fco.gov.uk) advises against it. Make sure you check what sports and hazardous activities are covered. To add cover for skydiving to a standard backpacker policy with Infinity Insurance Solutions (0845 658 0570, holidaysafe.co.uk) costs \u00a370.50, whereas with Insurewithease.com (0844 334 0155, insurewithease.com) it costs an additional \u00a3346.76. Other good providers include insurefortravel.co.uk and primaryinsurance.co.uk. Keep copies of your policy with you and if you receive treatment, keep receipts, a doctor&apos;s letter stating what was wrong and how you were treated. If you require treatment, try to get it pre-authorised by calling your insurer. Prepaid cards Prepaid currency cards help you keep track of your spending, and give better rates for foreign ATM withdrawals and currency exchange. You open an account, load money onto the card and use it like a debit card. According to moneysavingexpert.com, the FairFX prepaid card is the cheapest. There is a 1.5% transaction charge every time you make a payment or use an ATM, but that is usually lower than a debit card (most charge 2.75%). It charges no loading fee and can be topped up in euros, US dollars or sterling by debit card or bank transfer, online or by phone, and other people (eg, your parents) can top it up for you. You get FairFX&apos;s own exchange rate, which changes daily but generally beats the other prepaid cards. Apply for free via fairfx.com/opodo (usually \u00a39.95 via fairfx.com). According to Which?, the best cards are the Caxton FX (caxtonfxcard.com) and Travelex Cash Passport (cashpassport.com).

Safety The Foreign Office website (fco.gov.uk) gives updates on the safety and political events in every country, as well as general travel advice. For example, the FCO is advising against all travel to the Preah Vihear (Khaoi Pra Viharn in Thai) temple area in the D\u00e2ngr\u00eak mountains in Cambodia (near the Thai border, and popular with backpackers) because of violence in the region. Stay in touch If you&apos;re staying for a long time in one country, buy a local sim card and put it in your existing phone (get it &quot;unlocked&quot; before you go away). If you&apos;re travelling in several countries, a global sim card is better. According to moneysupermarket.com, one of the best value on the market is the Story Telecom TravelTalk roaming sim (storytelecom.com) \u2013 the sim costs \u00a330, but for that you get \u00a325 credit, 100 minutes of free incoming calls, and 100 outgoing calls cost \u00a316. The runner-up is the Simply travel sim (simply-fone.com), which costs from \u00a329.99, with \u00a315 starter credit, 100 minutes of free incoming calls, and the cost of 100 outgoing calls is \u00a315. But probably the best way to keep in touch is to use Skype over the internet for free or low-cost calls; many internet cafes now have Skype, or you can download it to your smartphone.

They first began to assail me when I actually worked in the shortbread city. As August approached, I would make a solemn vow to myself: I will attend some shows at the festival this year. Yet, more often than not, another autumn was approaching and still I had not set foot in any of the venues. My intentions were always noble and strong, but along the way they would be kidnapped by a variety of dodgy characters. They held them hostage in a tavern until a measure of drink had been taken that would have rendered any visit to a festival venue a foolish enterprise. Thus my cultural peregrinations tended to end in shabby defeat at the Jinglin&apos; Geordie or the Doric. Then the nightmares started as guilt kicked in at having avoided the fringe for another year. In the most Stygian of these, I plumbed abysses that no brother of Jesus should ever have had to endure. I am walking down the Royal Mile. I know it is mid-evening because the sun is casting shadows that seem to materialise into shapeless entities that crouch and pulse in the lanes and the doorways. Gradually they adopt forms. An army of grotesques emerges, moving slowly like the zombies in Shaun of the Dead. There are Albanian mime artists on stilts and a troupe of whirling dancers from beyond the Carpathians. A group of actors from that year&apos;s obligatory shocking fringe production is swearing and copulating. Their faces are twisted and distended and they chase me down wynds and alleys, their fingers always outstretched in accusation like the old Jews at the end of Marathon Man pointing at Laurence Olivier. I make it into a snug wee bar on the Grassmarket. My demons seem to have departed. But the worst is yet to come. A beautiful, olive-skinned maiden sashays over to me. There is an insinuation of oriental splendour in her visage and so I find myself saying: &quot;Howzit gaun, China?&quot; delighting myself with my witty repartee. Her ruby red dress is slashed almost to the top of her marbled thigh and, as she slips her fingers inside the top of her stocking top, she produces a pair of tickets for that evening&apos;s show by the Bangkok Ladyboys. &quot;Come and see me after the show,&quot; the cruel phantasm rasps and I wake up screaming and drenched in sweat. My therapist told me to confront these demons head-on and so last weekend I found myself passing through the hallowed portals of the book festival on Charlotte Square. Once I had negotiated a way through the mouldering and unread stacks of the main sponsor&apos;s newspaper I braced myself. For there in the little garden, surrounded on all sides by the writers&apos; pavilions, was the Edinburgh middle class at repose. They glide over the turf so slowly that you really do think you could be in a dream. But as they look up from their Hermann Hesses and Andrew Rawnsleys they regard you kindly as if to say: &quot;What took you so long?&quot; For previously I had only ever attended the opening and closing parties. The highlight of the weekend was a session with Howard Jacobson, perhaps one of the funniest and most acute writers in the United Kingdom. He was discussing his latest novel, The Finkler Question. I had never encountered him live, but he seemed to be everything I&apos;d hoped he&apos;d be: thoughtful, humble, compassionate, kind and very, very funny. Pleasingly, he even looked like he may not be a stranger to a few salvadors in the Abbotsford of an evening. Despite being introduced and questioned by Richard Holloway, who seemed to be fixated by the author&apos;s account of circumcision, Jacobson&apos;s greatness prevailed. Delightfully, there was also a wee Edinburgh-at-the-festival moment laid on for our delectation. As Jacobson finished answering the last audience inquiry \u2013 something about the naming of his book&apos;s characters \u2013 the questioner could not resist a final intervention. &quot;I was thinking of Balzac myself,&quot; he said. Even Holloway looked nonplussed as I wondered what Real Madrid&apos;s new French striker had to do with Jacobson&apos;s musings on Jewishness. What was I thinking of to have avoided listening to people such as these over the years? Perhaps it is my persistent Glaswegian inverse snobbishness. We tend to dismiss the festival, a phenomenon backed up by the startlingly few tickets sold to Glaswegians in preceding years. Here, we like to think that Glasgow is a city where culture happens 24/7 from January to December and that we don&apos;t require the pamperers, poseurs and flossers who are the unfortunate byproduct of the fringe. But we are wrong. Certainly, Glasgow is the real cultural capital of Scotland but to sit stubbornly in the dark during August when many of the world&apos;s great writers, artists and dramas are just 45 minutes up the road is unconscionable. Already I am planning my next pilgrimage to the book festival and I have my eye on Allan Massie&apos;s next appearance on Tuesday as he talks about his new book, The Story of the Stuarts. This humble genius is a national treasure so I might need to keek in under the tent covers. Then there&apos;s Seamus Heaney, Anne Donovan and Niall Ferguson all to relish. I may even seek out the Ladyboys of Bangkok and perhaps even send them over a couple of champagne cocktails later on with a wink and a smile. And is Jerry Sadowitz playing this year? Because he is among the most formidable magicians and comedians the UK has ever produced. I saw him once and he looked like the rat-catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. On Temazepam. But I will resist yet the dubious attractions of the comedy festival where there is still too high a chance that you will be be run over in the annual invasion of overpriced, estuary-accented wide boys.", "publicationDate": "2010-08-21T23:09:00Z", "tags": ["Edinburgh international book festival", "Edinburgh festival"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/22/kevin-mckenna-edinburgh-festival", "title": "How I lost my festival virginity to Howard | Kevin McKenna", "sentences": ["Her ruby red dress is slashed almost to the top of her marbled thigh and, as she slips her fingers inside the top of her stocking top, she produces a pair of tickets for that evening&apos;s show by the Bangkok Ladyboys.", "I may even seek out the Ladyboys of Bangkok and perhaps even send them over a couple of champagne cocktails later on with a wink and a smile."]}, {"article": "In Canada it is said that, unless we move quickly to provide relief in Pakistan, the Taliban and others will do so first and win the hearts and minds of the locals (NGOs caught in military agenda, 13 August). For shame! This humanitarian catastrophe can only be exacerbated by competitiveness. If one group can provide supplies and another group has the means to deliver those supplies, then this is surely the time when cautious co-operation can enhance the chance of saving lives and bringing relief. Where roads are washed out and helicopters cannot fly, people and pack animals are often the only means of reaching those cut off by the waters. Together, military provincial reconstruction teams, Taliban relief workers, NGOs and Afghan and Pakistan governments have a chance to pierce the fog of war with a ray of hope. Now, if ever, is the time when bridge building in Pakistan can be undertaken in all manner of ways. Peter Scott Elora, Ontario, Canada Failure of the Iraq war Seumas Milne says that the Iraq war &quot;has been a historic political and strategic failure for the US&quot; (Occupation of Iraq is rebranded, 13 August). I disagree: the US has achieved its goal perfectly. A recent article in the London Review of Books pointed out that behind the scenes the aim of US sanctions against Iraq in the 1990s was &quot;to destroy its ability to function as a modern industrial state&quot;. The May 2009 cover of The Atlantic Monthly displays a map of the Middle East as the US would like to see it: all of Israel&apos;s neighbours have been dismembered and fragmented into ethno-religious enclaves. The aim is to ensure Israeli military hegemony in the Middle East. Stable prosperous independent states in the region would threaten this. The current campaign against Iran is merely the next stage in this process. The real beauty of this is that American blood and money is spent to benefit Israel while weakening the US. General David Petraeus seems to recognise this, but the American political establishment has been totally subverted. Colin Sheppard Melbourne, Australia \u2022 Seumas Milne mars an otherwise excellent article with a prediction that oil majors operating in Iraq will sharply boost production so &quot;the global oil price can be slashed and the grip of recalcitrant Opec states broken&quot;. Why on earth would a company want to bring down the price, and therefore the profit, of its product? More than likely they will sit on supply and keep prices artificially high \u2013 just as they did before 1958. Some things never change. Giles Tuffin Perth, Western Australia Beneath the veil Regarding your editorial Beneath the veil (23 July): wearing the niqab in France and other western cultures goes against the tenets of secular, humanistic societies and most especially against a woman&apos;s right to choose whatever she wishes to wear. Muslim women wearing the niqab do so because they are under threat of violence from their husbands or families, not because it is a choice. A non-Muslim French woman can decide whether to cover her face without fearing punishment from the men around her. Denial abounds, of course, within the Muslim culture \u2013 as I well know from having lived in a Muslim country. If women are forced to wear a niqab or a burka in their indigenous countries, that is one thing. Importing these kinds of practices into western cultures that have codes of human rights is quite another. The number of women affected is irrelevant. It is the principle that counts. Human rights are human rights. Religious practices can not be allowed to supersede the law of the land in western societies. It is not the invisibility of a woman&apos;s face that is the challenge. It is the writer&apos;s own willingness to ignore the underlying issues surrounding that invisibility, and go along with a practice that, were it men who were affected, would be banned outright. Rhona Davies White Rock, BC, Canada Finding British products &quot;At the Bank of England they are scratching their heads&quot; (Why exports aren&apos;t beating UK recession, 13 August). This sent me to look around my house for British-made products. Furniture is all local Thai stuff. The fax, printer, CD player, boom box, floor fans, bath-heater, TV, oven, fridge and car are Japanese. This year&apos;s purchases are a Chinese-built computer plus a Korean monitor. Things are changing. I thought that a tin of Nivea might fit the bill, but the text on the bottom said &quot;Beiersdorf Hamburg&quot;. So I guess the only English item is a packet of Marks &amp; Spencer gingernuts, but that possession is vitiated by the fact that the packet I am currently munching away at is from Arnotts of Australia. None of this reflects deliberate spurning of British goods \u2013 it&apos;s just that they are no longer in contention. Sorry. R H Leary Bangkok, Thailand High-powered stupidity Are we becoming more stupid? asks Patrick Kingsley (Read, mark and inwardly digest, 6 August), citing our declining inability to focus on reading. The short answer is yes. Many undergraduates, coddled and entertained to death in featureless suburbs, arrive immature at university where they find that they can&apos;t read, can&apos;t think and can&apos;t cope. Read, mark, learn and inwardly digest becomes scan, highlight, rote-learn, regurgitate and forget. As some cannot conceptualise originality, plagiarism abounds, even unto the doctoral thesis. Underlying the current techno-entertainment frenzy, which appears to have doomed students&apos; concentration and focus, looms the culture of affluence, parental indulgence, credentialism and a huge sense of entitlement, which for some students is balanced by rarely expressed feelings of sheer hopelessness. These traits are compounded by those university teachers who believe that higher education, from undergraduate to doctoral, is chiefly a process of &quot;training&quot;, as if students were dogs. The longer answer, I believe, is that we are just as stupid as ever, but in a more high-powered way. Douglas Porteous Victoria, BC, Canada Bird&apos;s nest bonanza In 1995-96 I was working on an aid project in Bengkulu, Sumatra (Unusual industry draws residents&apos; ire, 13 August). The problem of finding somewhere to live for myself and my wife was solved \u2013 there being no such thing as an estate agent \u2013 when an Indonesian family of Chinese extraction discovered that their hardware shop/house in the old town near Fort Marlborough was the home of swiftlets in the rafters. They were happy to vacate their large house in the suburbs to tend the swiftlets, which were regarded as a gold mine. Sir Stamford Raffles, founder of Singapore, had his first posting with the East India Company in Georgetown, Penang, and eventually became governor of British Bengkulu. It was not a profitable colony in the pepper trade, but perhaps Bengkulu might have been more viable if Raffles had promoted the bird&apos;s nest industry, which was probably already going strong in Georgetown in his time. Raffles is still remembered warmly in Bengkulu as a beneficent governor, and there is an annual Raffles beach festival of lights. Ted Webber Buderim, Queensland, Australia Briefly \u2022 Thanks for your front-page story on capitalism, and other UK-related economic items (13 August). While bankers continue to drive the good ole juggernaut to God knows where, I would like to draw your attention to a major typo in David Cameron&apos;s electioneering hyperbole: please insert the word &quot;business&quot; between &quot;big&quot; and &quot;society&quot;. Peter Hoare Leicester, UK \u2022 Jan Morris&apos;s despair at the epidemic of public kissing must surely be tongue-in-cheek (13 August). No doubt that&apos;s why the dear writer has such a problem with kissing. Darian Hiles Adelaide, South Australia \u2022 Sadly Doyle is quite right about snarking (20 August). Laughing at power may be therapeutic, but it is hardly adequate. I recall once being a dinner guest of Inge and Herbert Marcuse back in the heady days of the late 60s. One of my fellow guests advocated laughing the oppressors out of power. Inge Marcuse responded by recalling that, in pre-second world war Germany, she and her smart young Jewish friends used to go out to &quot;laugh at the Nazis in their silly uniforms&quot;.

On a pre-tax basis, profits fell by just under 31% to \u00a3169.2m from \u00a3244.5m, a result that was blamed on various one-off costs. Underlying operating profits were up 14% at \u00a3307m. The weakest link was the Co-op&apos;s travel arm, where profits crashed 70% to just \u00a3400,000. Sales slumped by nearly 7% to \u00a3136m, a decline blamed on disruption caused by world events. &quot;The year began with the heavy snow that stalled the traditional early-booking period, and continued with an earthquake in Chile, riots in Bangkok, civil unrest in Greece, BA strikes and finally the unprecedented volcanic eruption in Iceland, which brought the industry to a standstill for a week,&quot; said Marks, adding: &quot;Margins remain under pressure in what is a fiercely competitive market.&quot; Like-for-like sales at the Co-op&apos;s supermarket chain were down 1% for the period, which the group put down to a series of temporary store closures as it rebrands the Somerfield chain, which it bought for \u00a31.6bn last year. It is shutting 24 Somerfield stores a week for refurbishment. Marks claimed like-for-like sales at Co-op-branded stores were ahead 2.5%. A confidential board report leaked earlier this year suggested the Somerfield merger had been a deal too far for the mutual, which also saw its financial services arm merge with the Britannia building society last year.

A Thai appeals court last week ruled he should be extradited to the US within three months. Today Bout&apos;s wife read a statement from her husband in which he said that an aide to the Thai president had visited him in prison in April. Bout claimed that during the visit Sirichok Sopha, an MP of the ruling Democrat party, showed him a photograph of a Challenger jet. &quot;He said that this is the personal airplane of Thaksin Shinawatra. Sirichok asked for my advice on how to intercept this aircraft and how to catch Shinawatra,&quot; Bout said in the statement. Bout said Sirichok tried to link Thaksin with a planeload of North Korean weapons seized in Bangkok last December. Thaksin, prime minister for five years until he was ousted in a coup in 2006, is wanted by Thai authorities to serve a two-year jail term for corruption. The billionaire former leader, who remains hugely popular in rural Thailand, lives in exile in Dubai and efforts by the Thai government to have him extradited have failed. Sirichok admitted this week he met Bout in prison, but said he only wanted to talk to him about the weapons seizure. Bout has an interest in delaying his extradition in the hope he will be freed if the three-month deadline passes with him still in Bangkok.

He was caught in a five-star Bangkok hotel in a 2008 sting operation, in which he allegedly offered to sell millions of dollars worth of weapons to agents posing as Colombian rebels.

It is understood they will stand as candidates for the junta&apos;s largest proxy party, the Union Solidarity and Development party (USDP), in constituencies in the capital, Naypyidaw. An unnamed military official said 15 senior army officials had resigned their posts, but did not confirm that the junta&apos;s leader was among them. But a second source told agencies the resignations went right to the top: &quot;All top leaders have given up their military positions.&quot; It is the second major reshuffle since April, when 27 senior military figures, including the prime minister, Thein Sein, resigned to lead the USDP. Burma&apos;s last elections, in 1990, were won overwhelmingly by the main opposition party, the National League for Democracy, led by Aung San Suu Kyi. But the junta refused to recognise the result and Aung San Suu Kyi has spent most of the past two decades in detention. Her party is boycotting the poll after she was excluded from participating by new election laws which forbid people in custody from running for office. She is due to be released less than a week after the 7 November election. Supporters of the polls say any move towards democracy, however flawed, is an improvement on the current military rule. Thirty-seven non-regime parties have registered for the elections, but few have a national presence and none have the money or influence of the pro-regime party and its proxies. But critics of Burma&apos;s &quot;road map to democracy&quot;, including Britain, the US and the UN, have dismissed the election as a sham, saying the poll will only entrench and formalise military rule. &quot;We don&apos;t regard the forthcoming elections as being a legitimate expression of public opinion,&quot; Jeremy Browne, a Foreign Office minister, said in Bangkok last month. &quot;We continue to have a very strong view the situation in Burma is unacceptable.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-08-27T17:53:52Z", "tags": ["World news", "Aung San Suu Kyi", "Human rights", "Law", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/27/burma-dictator-resigns-military-post", "title": "Burma's ailing dictator resigns military post", "sentences": ["&quot;We don&apos;t regard the forthcoming elections as being a legitimate expression of public opinion,&quot; Jeremy Browne, a Foreign Office minister, said in Bangkok last month."]}, {"article": "&apos;In my view, if you do something, it&apos;s worth doing it in a very big way; whether you are talking about travel, listening to Bob Dylan, or romance.&quot; For Andy Kershaw this is still as close to a guide for good living as it gets. And the credo has served him fairly well, though it did prove unreliable three years ago when he applied it both to drinking and to a widely reported domestic and emotional meltdown. Now recovered, on the wagon, and on the brink of returning to BBC radio with a series of world music documentaries, Kershaw is determinedly sticking with his passionate approach to life. Innately curious and with an encyclopaedic memory for facts and figures, he cannot understand people who do not want to know how the world works: people who are happy, in his words, &quot;to listen to Phil Collins&quot; for the rest of their days. &quot;Music and culture have never been divorced for me,&quot; he says. &quot;How can you go to somewhere like Cambodia and have no sense of the history and the politics of the place? Music does not exist in isolation. It&apos;s dynamic, like language. It&apos;s self-referential and always changing.&quot; For his new Radio 3 show, Music Planet, due to broadcast in tandem with the BBC1 natural history series Human Planet in the new year, Kershaw has been to Thailand to record a singer/songwriter who had been inside a Burmese jail for 10 years. A supporter of Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese opposition leader under house arrest, he and his fellow prisoners smuggled protest songs out of prison, word by word, on cigarette stubs. &quot;So the next time you hear a big rock band complaining their sandwiches are the wrong shape,&quot; says Kershaw, &quot;this puts it all in context.&quot; Kershaw&apos;s comeback show, announced last week, has actually been in production since March and the presenter has already travelled from his home on the Isle of Man to far-flung places new even to an enthusiastic traveller, who &quot;at the last count had been to 87 of the world&apos;s 195 countries&quot;. However, this weekend the former Radio 1 DJ is back in the Manx seaside home that he shares with his 13-year-old son, Sonny, and is free to watch the famous motorbike road races that first drew him to the island. The daily Grand Prix sessions that mark the end of the Manx summer follow the same notoriously challenging course as the TT race, tracing the shape of the Isle of Man through a succession of tiny lanes and rural villages. Kershaw and his son rarely miss a session. As the sun set last Thursday, the two were together on a grass verge opposite the ad hoc track, equipped with a vacuum flask and a bag of biscuits. On the other side of the road the hanging baskets outside a pretty white cottage rocked jauntily as every 20 seconds a motorbike roared past spectators standing just inches from the road. By chance, this is the same Kirk Michael cottage that Kershaw once rented and where he was often visited by his colleague, the late John Peel. It was here one summer, Kershaw remembers, that Peel heard by telephone the news that his wife, Sheila, had suffered a dangerous brain haemorrhage. For several years the two DJs shared Room 318 at Egton House, the old Radio 1 building next to Broadcasting House in London, sitting alongside their influential producer and fellow broadcaster John Walters. When Kershaw, now 50, moved down to London after making his name promoting gigs at Leeds University, Walters became &quot;a kind of surrogate father&quot; to him, or, Kershaw corrects himself, &quot;a kind of exotic uncle would be more accurate&quot;. Walters used to phone his young acolyte at 2.15 every afternoon. &quot;I knew it would be him because The Archers had finished,&quot; says Kershaw. &quot;He was the source of so much wisdom and wit and he guided me on all sorts of things, like buying my first flat in London, and who were suitable girlfriends. I was just devastated when Walters died, because he went very suddenly.&quot; He adds: &quot;I had been almost disowned by my own father for choosing a life of rock and roll, rather than becoming a lawyer.&quot; In an early confrontation with his father, a headmaster, Kershaw once told him he did not want to spend his allotted time on Earth &quot;house conveyancing in the Rochdale area&quot;. Now, however, he suspects he might have made a good lawyer. After serving time in a Manx prison for breaking a restraining order that prevented him from approaching his ex-partner, Juliette Banner, the mother of Sonny and his younger sister Dolly, Kershaw chose to represent himself in family court proceedings. The legal case followed a long period in which the presenter&apos;s friends watched in horror as the break-up of his relationship, the loss of contact with his children, and the ultimate loss of his livelihood sent him spiralling out of control. While his ex has now set up home in Scotland with a new partner, Kershaw has his son back with him on the Isle of Man, the two of them living with their dog, Buster, on the old-fashioned seafront of a town coincidentally named Peel. &quot;Walters once told me that human society could be divided into two eras, pre-avocado and post-avocado,&quot; says Kershaw. &quot;I think Peel on the Isle of Man is definitely pre-avocado.&quot; His daughter Dolly has also stayed with him this summer. He divides his time on the island between writing and going out to sea with Sonny on their boat to drop lobster pots. &quot;The boat has proved very therapeutic,&quot; Kershaw says. In his book-lined study, across the bay from Peel Castle, Kershaw is putting together an autobiography that will chart his wildly varied career as a roadie, a youthful presenter of Live Aid, an influential figure in world music and an occasional news correspondent from dangerous hotspots such as Haiti, Rwanda and, most recently, Bangkok during the red shirt rioting. &quot;I found I couldn&apos;t start the book until I came up with a title. It is going to be called No Off Switch, and, once I had that, I knew how to do it,&quot; he says. At the end of a recent whistle-stop tour of Cambodia, Burma, Laos and Thailand, Kershaw found himself in Bangkok during the riots and filed a newspaper dispatch from the midst of the fighting, dodging a sniper by diving into an empty market stall. &quot;There were chips of asphalt jumping off the road surface each time one of these measured cracks of gunfire rang out,&quot; he recalls. The adventure was no accident. Kershaw is fearless, accepting an invitation to go into Rwanda in 1994 and providing memorable coverage for the BBC. &quot;There are a lot of amateur psychologists who like to say Rwanda screwed me up. It didn&apos;t,&quot; he asserts. &quot;My grandparents&apos; generation went through this kind of thing routinely for years in the first and second world wars. Some neurotics may tell me I am suffering from something called post-traumatic stress disorder. I am not. Rwanda was horrific, but I just reported it.&quot; Aside from his consuming passion for news, Bob Dylan and motorbikes, a love of Africa has absorbed much of Kershaw&apos;s career, peaking in 1985 when he became a devotee of the Zimbabwean band the Bhundu Boys. At one of their early London gigs with John Peel, he turned to see his &quot;soppy bugger&quot; colleague with tears running down his cheeks. &quot;You see, after first hearing American rock music as a young man, Peel never imagined he would feel so blown away by any music ever again.&quot; It is this urge to bring new talent to British ears that is driving the Radio 3 shows. Travelling with a producer, and sometimes a sound recordist, Kershaw visited four African countries in eight days last month after taking a fortnight to sample the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. High points have included recordings made in a temple on the Mekong in Laos, the bizarre Yasothon Rocket Festival, featuring 50ft-long missiles fired for fun by drunk students (&quot;there was not a health and safety officer, not a fireman, not an ambulance, not even a hose in sight&quot;), a Siberian throat-singing festival and, perhaps most surprisingly, jazz yodelling in Switzerland. He is off to Namibia soon \u2013 one of the few African countries he has never visited \u2013 to make another Radio 3 programme, &quot;It is better than house conveyancing in the Rochdale area,&quot; Kershaw confirms. And if it is, he owes thanks to Roger Wright, the controller of BBC Radio 3. It was Wright who took the DJ out for an Indian lunch when he left Radio 1 and who has kept faith in recent years. &quot;Back then he said he liked my show because he never knew what was coming next,&quot; says Kershaw. &quot;And that was it. He had me.&quot; But what still gives Kershaw most professional pleasure, he says, is the idea that a band first heard on Music Planet might play the Womad festival next year. &quot;That is what is satisfying about being back on the radio.&quot; Music Planet will air on Radio 3 next year", "publicationDate": "2010-08-28T23:03:47Z", "tags": ["Radio 3", "BBC", "World music", "Music", "Andy Kershaw"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/aug/29/andy-kershaw-world-music-bbc-interview", "title": "Andy Kershaw: 'Amateur psychologists say Rwanda screwed me up.

The document contains a pledge to protect eight key parks from damage by asking event organisers to consider the city&apos;s 136 other parks when arranging their shows.  The Meadows in particular currently hosts events including Ladyboys of Bangkok, the Meadows Festival and Funfair and the Fringe Festival Funfair. Operators can use the park for up to four weeks, while other parks have a 15 day limit.      Chris Wigglesworth of the Friends of the Meadows and Bruntsfield Links    Local campaigners lobbied for the event time limits to be spread equally around the city&apos;s other parks, but this week councillors voted through the new manifesto.  Green party councillor Steve Burgess said despite &quot;not going far enough&quot; there were still positives to be taken in the Edinburgh Parks Events Manifesto from a sustainability point of view.   He said: &quot;I feel a month is far too long for there to be a big tent and the associated traffic on the grass. The damage could have been limited by controlling that length of time or looking at other venues.  &quot;Unfortunately the commercial argument won over the environmental one. However the very fact that there is now a parks manifesto is a step in the right direction and I would credit the members of the Friends of the Meadows and Bruntsfield Links with that.  &quot;Previously there were no criteria and the damage was constant. The changes definitely do not go far enough and there&apos;s lots of room for improvement so I hope the money raised by charging for use of the space stays ring-fenced for any reinstatement that&apos;s needed once shows move on.  &quot;It&apos;s been made very clear that these larger events like the Urban Circus and the Ladyboys need to be in the central location of the Meadows for financial viability. But I understand that the Taste event and the Moonwalk seem happy in their new homes having moved away from the Meadows, so that is another positive sign for the future.&quot;   Large events on the Meadows turf, which sits on top of a layer of clay, can take up to six months to grow back according to local campaigner Chris Wigglesworth.  The Friends of the Meadows and Bruntsfield Links convener said his group will keep a close eye on the new policies being adhered to.   He said: &quot;We welcome the commitment to have some sort of structure to events in our parks. That&apos;s the thing, that these are public parks and if anyone is making any money out of them, they ought to be giving some back to leave them as they found them.  &quot;Local people are not happy with the state of the Meadows once people like the Ladyboys and the circuses leave. They make millions between them and pay back peanuts.  &quot;It is frustrating that moves to limit events to a fortnight were not successful, because no other parks allow events for four weeks.&quot;   In presenting the new Edinburgh Parks Events Manifesto to the council, Services for Communities director Mark Turley said parks would be &quot;safeguarded for future generations.&quot;   He said: The introduction of an Edinburgh Events Manifesto will have a positive effect on the city&apos;s environment, by introducing a sustainable approach to planning events in Edinburgh&apos;s parks and greenspaces.  &quot;It will ensure that the parks and greenspaces are safeguarded for current users and future generations.&quot;  ", "publicationDate": "2010-09-03T07:55:15Z", "tags": [], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/edinburgh/2010/sep/02/edinburgh-meadows-parks-events-manifesto", "title": "Move to share events around Edinburgh parks", "sentences": ["The Meadows in particular currently hosts events including Ladyboys of Bangkok, the Meadows Festival and Funfair and the Fringe Festival Funfair."]}, {"article": "As a child growing up in London, I was blissfully unaware of other worlds less safe and secure than my own. That all changed when I was about 12. Leafing through National Geographic, I started reading a feature about some ancient ruins in Cambodia that looked very beautiful. But what really caught my attention was an article next to it about the country waking up from the nightmare of the Khmer Rouge. Seeing those images of victims&apos; skulls and mass graves was a defining moment for me. I couldn&apos;t believe there were countries where crimes such as this could happen \u2013 what really terrified me was finding out that members of the Khmer Rouge still hadn&apos;t been brought to justice. I\u00a0started to read up about the country; how Pol Pot&apos;s regime had wanted an agrarian revolution where life would be very simple, which had instead resulted in horror and bloodshed. Nearly 2 million people had been killed outright or died as a result of torture, overwork or starvation in the latter half of the 1970s. More than half a decade later, still fascinated, I went to art school, but dropped out after a year, realising there was only one thing I wanted to\u00a0do \u2013 to travel to Cambodia to make sense of it myself. On my second day in the country, I made a beeline for a memorial site at Tuol Sleng prison, an\u00a0interrogation centre where confessions were forced out of alleged spies and saboteurs. The man in charge, Comrade Duch, had personally overseen the torture and execution of at least 14,000 people. It was Duch&apos;s portrait in the prison that fuelled my\u00a0interest in tracking him down. I\u00a0thought if there was anyone who could explain how these atrocities had come about, it was him. Over the next few years, I worked in Bangkok as a photographer, making trips back to Cambodia, always carrying a photo of Duch to show defected Khmer Rouge members. I never believed I&apos;d find him. But in 1999 I made a breakthrough. By chance, on another assignment, I travelled to a nearby Khmer Rouge area that had just opened up. I was wandering around when a small, wiry man in an African Refugee Committee T-shirt came and introduced himself as Hang Pin. I knew immediately who he really was. It was the same face I&apos;d been carrying around with me for more than a\u00a0decade. Duch was a little bit greyer, but there was no doubt in my mind. We had a fairly banal conversation \u2013 he was interested in my camera, and I tried to appear as nonchalant as I could. This was no ranting, cold-eyed madman; he was garrulous, friendly, disarming. He told me he was a humanitarian aid worker and lay-preacher, converting Cambodians to Christianity. Surreptitiously I took a photograph, but it didn&apos;t seem the right time to confront him. I wondered if he might still be a killer. Later, I returned to the village with Nate Thayer \u2013 the last western journalist to have interviewed Pol Pot. We talked to Duch about land mines and his planned church, but he dodged any leading questions about his past. It was only when he asked to see Nate&apos;s business card that we realised Duch had suspicions of his own. &quot;Nic,&quot; he said, &quot;I believe your friend has interviewed Pol Pot.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; I said. Duch gave a deep sigh: &quot;I believe it is God&apos;s will you are here,&quot; he said. It was almost as if he&apos;d always expected this day to come. After that he talked openly about what had happened and said he was very sorry. I&apos;d spent 10 years pursuing a &quot;monster&quot;, and found instead a wizened old man who appeared to be contrite and displaying humanity. We showed him confessions from Tuol Sleng prisoners, and he identified his handwriting on them. A few days later, Duch simply gave\u00a0himself up to the Cambodian authorities, but it took another decade for him to be tried through a\u00a0United Nations-backed tribunal. Found guilty of crimes against humanity, he faces 35 years in jail. My part in this process has been very small; finding him was an accident, and the chain of events since has had nothing to do with me. It wasn&apos;t my plan to bring him to justice; I simply wanted to see for myself how this man \u2013 a\u00a0former mathematician and teacher \u2013 had become one of the most notorious mass murderers of the 20th century. \u2022 As told to Chris Broughton.

Behind them, under the light of the full moon, thousands more shirtless, shoeless Europeans are massed outside 14 beachside bars, their knees bending awkwardly to a soundtrack of the Black Eyed Peas, Justin Bieber and generic drum&apos;n&apos;bass. And squeezed between the bars and the crowds are 35 wooden stalls, each selling plastic buckets filled with a litre&apos;s worth of vodka and Red Bull. The stalls are daubed with deeply dubious slogans, ranging from the lurid to the the moronic. &quot;No Bucket No Boom Boom&quot;, &quot;Fuck My Buckets&quot;, &quot;Everybody Fuck My Strong Buckets&quot; \u2013 that kind of thing. Welcome to the Full Moon Party, the largest beach rave in the world. Twenty-five years ago, this was a little-known hippy hang-out on the remote Thai island of Koh Phangan. Today, frequented every month by between 10,000 and 30,000 European youngsters, the all-night party is the ultimate destination on south-east Asia&apos;s &quot;banana pancake&quot; trail; a mecca for footloose gap-year tourists. This party scene, right here on this beach, is arguably the epitome, the pinnacle, of the modern gap-year experience. Three weeks ago, the chief executive of the universities and colleges admissions service (UCAS) declared to a Sunday newspaper that &quot;the golden age of the gap year is over&quot;. Mary Curnock Cook argued that while in the past &quot;a gap year has been when young people take a nice break and go out and see the world&quot;, the period should now &quot;be used in a focused way to support an application to the course or university you are targeting&quot;. In a year when the number of university applications \u2013 a record 660,000 \u2013 has dwarfed the number of university places available \u2013 450,000 \u2013 Curnock Cook may have a point. But this is a point that has yet to trickle down, in practical terms, to the nation&apos;s school-leavers. In fact, the vast majority of gappers do not use their year-out in anything approaching a fashion that might \u2013 in the eyes of universities \u2013 be viewed as &quot;constructive&quot;. Every year around 160,000 British school-leavers take a gap year before entering university. More than 80% of them, says Richard Oliver, chairman of trustees at Year Out, &quot;just go off and travel independently without any real purpose. Sun, sand and sangria, as I call it.&quot; Indeed, the trend might even be away from the year of constructive good deeds that Curnock Cook might be thinking of \u2013 a trend towards increasingly mindless hedonism. Hans Hoefer is the founder of Insight travel books, and the man who co-ordinated one of the first guides to Thailand back in the 70s, when fewer tourists visited the entire country (150,000) than now visit Burma annually. These days &quot;gappers&quot; touring Koh Phangan and its surrounding islands are, says Hoefer, &quot;not experiencing anything apart from tourism. It&apos;s an absolute joke. They don&apos;t want to understand the culture \u2013 they just want to binge. I don&apos;t understand why they go.&quot; Attempting to understand why they go, however, why this is the modern gap-year experience, is exactly what brings me to the Full Moon Party, surrounded by scores of topless teenagers urinating into the ocean to the words of the Black Eyed Peas&apos; &quot;I gotta feeling/That tonight&apos;s gonna be a good night/That tonight&apos;s gonna be a good, good night.&quot; What exactly is the lure of this beach to teenagers who are, after all, meant to be Britain&apos;s brightest? I&apos;m here to find out. When gappers touch down in Bangkok, their first port-of-call is almost always the backpackers&apos; ghetto on the Khao San Road. In The Beach, Alex Garland&apos;s 1996 novel about a young man&apos;s search for adventure in Thailand, Khao San is described as a decompression chamber between east and west. But when I arrive, it soon becomes clear that even this is a generous description; the Khao San Road actually doesn&apos;t feel like it&apos;s in Thailand at all. The street is crammed with bars showing premiership football; Britney Spears and Bob Dylan blare out of every speaker; hawkers selling European T-shirts jostle with those selling fake British ID cards. This April, 20 Thais were massacred in clashes between soldiers and anti-government redshirt protesters barely 100 metres from the Khao San Road. But it might as well have been 100 miles away: the Khao San&apos;s tourist festivities were barely disrupted. And when Alex, a well-travelled graphic designer from west London who &quot;took several gap years&quot;, muses to me that &quot;the Khao San just feels like home&quot;, he&apos;s spot on, though perhaps not in quite the way he intends: apart from the fat, bald westerners parading their suspiciously beautiful Thai girlfriends, the road could be a carbon copy of Camden High Street. In years gone by, backpackers travelling onwards to the Full Moon Party might have briefly escaped this westernised gauntlet by taking the overnight train or bus down the coast to the ferry terminal of Surat Thani. Today, however, it&apos;s almost as cheap to take the plane down \u2013 and so this is what photographer Sean Smith and I end up doing. A couple of cramped ferry journeys bring us finally to Koh Phangan, and it isn&apos;t long before I&apos;m talking to the cream of British gappers. &quot;You know what the worst thing about travelling is?&quot; asks Londoner Jez, 19 years old, dressed in a vest, and approaching the end of his year out. He enlightens me: &quot;TOURISTS.&quot; It&apos;s a slightly strange answer: we&apos;re sitting on the side of a dirt track near the centre of Had Rin, the main tourist town on Koh Phangan, and venue for tomorrow&apos;s Full Moon Party. Tourists are whizzing past every 30 seconds on mopeds belching out acrid fumes. Every second shop is an internet cafe packed with tourists checking Facebook. Every third shop is a travel agent&apos;s filled with tourists plotting their next move. It&apos;s an odd place to visit if you don&apos;t like tourists. And particularly if you yourself are one. But Jez \u2013 a warm, welcoming guy \u2013 doesn&apos;t think of himself as a tourist: he&apos;s a backpacker. &quot;Most of the people here are backpackers,&quot; he insists. &quot;Backpackers are infinitely different to tourists. Backpackers will accept anyone. Whereas tourists are the kind of people who back home would end up in fights. But backpackers have no interest in fighting anyone, do they?&quot; Jez directs this question at Pete, an even friendlier backpacker whom he met a few months ago in Vietnam. Pete, earringed and also wearing a vest, is 23, British and on a different kind of gap year; he&apos;s been given a year&apos;s leave of absence from the army. For most of his time off, he has been working as a promoter for a bar in Vang Vieng, Laos, but he&apos;s back in Had Rin for one last Full Moon Party. Pete couldn&apos;t agree more with Jez. &quot;Yup,&quot; he says. &quot;Tourists are the people who spend their time fighting here. Tourists are people who go on holiday for two weeks.&quot; He pauses, then adds: &quot;So if you can, put in the Guardian, somehow, that this is not a place where you can go for two weeks. This is a place for backpackers. Tourists may pay more money, but they&apos;re fucking idiots.&quot; Pete&apos;s not sure I&apos;ve got the message, so he leans in once more. &quot;Where I work in Vang Vieng, I saw these two tourist girls with handbags, wearing skirts and dresses. But in Vang Vieng you should be wearing a bikini, and nothing else. So I said to them, &apos;You girls are a fucking disgrace, get the fuck out of here.&apos; And my job is to get people into a bar! So I&apos;ve ruined the chance of those people coming into my bar. But that&apos;s how much backpackers hate tourists.&quot; In The Beach, Richard, the protagonist, is told that &quot;Hat Rin&apos;s [sic] a long way past its sell-by date. They sell printed flyers for the full-moon parties now.&quot; And that was 14 years ago. But to Jez, even in 2010, the town is still sacred. &quot;I just fucking love this place,&quot; he says, &quot;because it just sums up everything about youth. Ten thousand people condensed into one area where they can do every single thing they want to, without any regrets. Back home, you get really shit-faced and there are repercussions. Out here you can do what you want. It&apos;s somewhere like Ibiza before it turned shit. It&apos;s way cheaper, too.&quot; And, of course, there are the backpackers. &quot;As most of the people here are backpackers,&quot; Jez re-explains, &quot;you&apos;ll be walking along and you&apos;ll see someone you know. And then you&apos;ll see them again and again. All the people you&apos;ve met while you&apos;re travelling will be here. It&apos;s just awesome.&quot; The drugs are also a big draw. These guys know exactly which pharmacies sell speed \u2013 and what to ask for when they&apos;re at the counter. They know where to go to buy weed, and can name the three bars in town that list magic mushroom milkshakes on the menu. Sounds fun, I say, but if everything here is all so western and familiar \u2013 and if they&apos;re spending most of the week off their heads \u2013 are they really experiencing Thailand? Pete is brutally frank. &quot;This isn&apos;t a Thai experience,&quot; he admits, instantly. &quot;This is a party experience. Chiang Mai and Bangkok, you get a Thai experience. Koh Phangan is a party place.&quot; Jez agrees, but is quick to emphasise that, for them, the &quot;party experience&quot; is a supplement to, and not a replacement of, the &quot;Thai experience&quot;. &quot;We&apos;ve gone through the Thai experience,&quot; Jez clarifies. &quot;We&apos;ve seen it, we&apos;ve done it. So for us this is just a nice way to cap it off and celebrate what we&apos;ve achieved, all that we&apos;ve been through. A lot of people just see the Khao San Road and here \u2013 and they&apos;re tourists. They&apos;re not travellers. They&apos;re not going to learn anything here about Thai culture. Whereas going to places like Chiang Mai, you just learn so much about their culture of respect, and the emphasis they place on those . . . those aspects.&quot; Jez and Pete are having a &quot;shroom&quot; session with some of their many backpacker friends that evening, and, true to their backpacker philosophy, they invite me along. And so, a few hours later, we rendezvous once more in a bar built high above Sunrise Beach (where, in 24 hours, the Full Moon Party will take place) \u2013 a bar nicknamed, for reasons which soon become apparent, Mushroom Mountain. Turnout is lower than expected; Jez and Pete are joined only by two second-year medical students from Nottingham \u2013 Hailey, who took a gap year, and Laura, who didn&apos;t. When I raise Curnock Cook&apos;s comments, I get: &quot;That is one of the stupidest things I&apos;ve ever heard,&quot; from Jez, who will start at Newcastle this autumn, studying philosophy. &quot;Taking a gap year was probably the best decision I&apos;ve ever made. It&apos;s taught me more than 18 years in school ever did. I could write you an essay on Shakespeare or tell you the strengths and weaknesses of Immanuel Kant&apos;s Critique of Pure Reason, but at the end of the day that means fuck all in the real world, unless you go out and experience it. And fair enough, Koh Phangan isn&apos;t really the real world, but it&apos;s still an experience. &quot;I met a guy three days ago who&apos;d done five tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he was telling me that during a Full Moon Party in 2008, he&apos;d had to pull two Swedish girls who&apos;d washed up, dead, out of the sea. To meet people like that, to see the lives that people go through, to escape the private-school bubble that a lot of kids end up in, it really opens your eyes to stuff. Shows you how life isn&apos;t just about getting good A-level results, getting a good degree and a good job.&quot; Hailey&apos;s gap-year experiences were slightly different to Jez&apos;s. She didn&apos;t go travelling at all, she says, but spent the entire period working in a hospital in order to enhance her application to medical school; a perfect exemplar of the kind of gap year favoured by Curnock Cook. In many ways, though, she wishes she&apos;d chosen a more relaxed path. &quot;I don&apos;t know if I should say this,&quot; she starts, pauses, then continues: &quot;I was in a verbally abusive relationship for three years, which meant I had no self-confidence. And I turned into a bit of a slut on my gap year because I was really messed up in the head. And then I went to uni, and I thought, &apos;I don&apos;t want to be either of those people I&apos;ve been, I want to be someone else.&apos; So then I sort of had three personalities. But coming out here on my own, having to go over and talk to people, having to be nice, not an asshole . . . It&apos;s been great. It teaches you how to socialise properly. It makes you so much more confident. Coming out here, travelling on your own . . .&quot; She trails off, and then hurriedly starts again: &quot;If I&apos;d done the whole travelling on my own thing in my gap year, I would have been slightly less messed up at uni.&quot; I&apos;d been warned that as Full Moon night grew messier, the beach&apos;s toilets would be rammed full of lady-boys at work, their feet three-inches-deep in urine. Old hands predicted that when the sun rose the following morning, the sand would be carpeted with couples rolling around on a terrine of broken bottles, cups, buckets, straws, pills, lost flip-flops and unconscious drunks. This isn&apos;t quite how it happens on this full moon though. Certainly, the music is crap, and there are sordid aspects \u2013 the bucket stalls; the odd party-goer collapsing to the floor; one man vomiting into the sea beside that long line of urinators. But, despite being sober and solo, I find the atmosphere surprisingly euphoric, and my overall memories are of smiling dancers whose moves became more liberated as the night rolled into morning. One such happy chappy is Francesco, a 19-year-old gapper from Bournemouth whom I encounter near a giant fiery skipping rope. &quot;Mate,&quot; he says cheerily, &quot;throw away that notebook, get a bucket, and just get TRASHED.&quot; Francesco would probably be described by official backpackers as a tourist \u2013 not that Francesco himself would mind. &quot;There&apos;s different ways of travelling,&quot; he says. &quot;This is about getting smashed. Getting in the buckets of Chang&quot; \u2013 a local beer \u2013 &quot;and just going for it. Back home, you walk in a pub, you get ID&apos;d. Out here, you just lose the plot.&quot; Working-class Francesco comes from the opposite end of the gap-year spectrum to most gappers I meet. &quot;I had to work night and day to get here,&quot; he says. &quot;I went round all the hotels back home trying to get work. I ended up working seven days a week, in a call-centre by day, and a pub by night.&quot; For him, then, the Full Moon is a once in a lifetime event, and it&apos;s hard to begrudge him his utter elation at being here. There is though one group who seem less enamoured with this event: the locals. Though the Full Moon might be the festival highlight of the year for most of the gappers, tourists and backpackers on the beach, for the Thais that run it \u2013 and clean up after it \u2013 the party must seem like a monotonous, monthly chore. As Charlie Cassidy, a tall, bald expat who has lived in Hat Rin for the past decade, explains, &quot;The locals don&apos;t actually go to the Full Moon. We go to the after-party up the hill the following morning. The Full Moon&apos;s just for the kiddies.&quot; At four in the morning, I visit The Rock, a bar perched high above the sand at the opposite end of the beach to Mushroom Mountain. At the back, staring out over the partying crowds below, stands the long-haired Sutti Kuasurkul. Sutti&apos;s the man who opened Had Rin&apos;s first backpacker accommodation in the mid-80s \u2013 the Paradise Bungalows next door \u2013 and who, legend has it, organised the first Full Moon party shortly afterwards. But rather than smiling proudly at the institution he inspired, Sutti merely looks on forlornly, face motionless, eyes dulled. Would he mind answering a few questions about the origins of the party, I ask him? He shakes his head. Maybe tomorrow, or the next day, he says, before disappearing downstairs. &quot;Sutti doesn&apos;t really like talking about the party,&quot; explains Charlie. &quot;For him, the Full Moon&apos;s just some farewell party he held for an Aussie mate back in the 80s, which just happened to catch on.&quot; Sutti, it seems, isn&apos;t too enamoured with what the party&apos;s become. &quot;Sutti?&quot; asks Charlie, rhetorically. &quot;He&apos;d rather be fishing.&quot; Fifty metres away, in the DJ&apos;s booth at Paradise Bungalows, sits Burmese immigrant DJ Shine \u2013 or just plain Shane to his friends. Shane&apos;s 25 and he&apos;s lived in Had Rin since he was 16. This, then, is roughly his 50th Full Moon as a DJ, and his 100th overall. And Shane&apos;s bored \u2013 bored with playing the same electro-house on the same broken CDJ to the same crowds. He speaks perfect English, complete with a cockney accent, but he&apos;s never been to Britain, never visited the British friends he&apos;s made during his time on the island. And so, as he plays mix after mix after mix, month after month after month, Shane stares out at the thousands of Europeans who will soon be flying home, and wishes he could one day go with them. &quot;But,&quot; he says, &quot;I just can&apos;t afford it.&quot; Up and down the beach, young western men are still unzipping their shorts and peeing into the Gulf of Thailand. Though I never took a gap year, never took the chance to either let my hair down like this, or do something more constructive, nothing that I&apos;ve heard or seen here makes me want to join them.

The two books scored an equal number of votes from members of the World Science Fiction Society, beating authors including Robert J Sawyer and Cherie Priest to jointly win the prestigious science fiction award in Melbourne, Australia yesterday. The last time two books tied for the Hugo best novel prize was in 1993, when Vernor Vinge&apos;s A Fire Upon the Deep and Connie Willis&apos;s Doomsday Book shared the award. And 44 years ago, in 1966, Frank Herbert&apos;s Dune and Roger Zelazny&apos;s ... And Call Me Conrad also tied to take the prize. With Mi\u00e9ville&apos;s novel a fantastical twist on a crime story, and Bacigalupi&apos;s a futuristic tale about an engineered girl grown for sex tourists, this year&apos;s winning titles show the range of science fiction today. Set in Thailand, The Windup Girl tells the story of the beautiful Emiko, grown in a creche for a Kyoto businessman but now abandoned in Bangkok, and her encounter with AgriGen&apos;s &quot;Calorie Man&quot; Anderson Lake, whose job is to look for &quot;extinct&quot; foodstuffs to help his company &quot;reap the bounty of history&apos;s lost calories&quot;. It has been compared to William Gibson&apos;s cyberpunk classic Neuromancer in the Washington Post, which also cited Margaret Atwood, JG Ballard and Philip K Dick as influences. The book also carried off this year&apos;s Nebula award for best novel. Bacigalupi pronounced himself &quot;blown away and so pleased with this huge honour&quot;, describing his fellow winner&apos;s novel as &quot;excellent&quot;. The City and the City, which has already won Mi\u00e9ville the UK&apos;s top two science fiction prizes, the Arthur C Clarke and British Science Fiction Association awards, is very different to Bacigalupi&apos;s novel. The story of a murder investigation in the decaying city of Bes\u017ael, it quickly emerges that things aren&apos;t quite as they seem: Bes\u017ael exists in the same physical space as another city, Ul Qoma, and Inspector Tyador Borl\u00fa of the Extreme Crime Squad must travel there to solve the mystery. &quot;Mi\u00e9ville thickens his plot with exceptional mastery,&quot; wrote Michael Moorcock in the Guardian. &quot;Keeping his grip firmly on an idea which would quickly slip from the hands of a less skilled writer, Mi\u00e9ville again proves himself as intelligent as he is original&quot;. Won in the past by authors including Arthur C Clarke, Isaac Asimov and Ursula K Le Guin, the Hugos have been running since 1953. This year, the best novella prize was taken by Charles Stross for Palimpsest (&quot;I am gobsmacked.

Bryan Robson&apos;s Thailand deservedly defeated Bob Houghton&apos;s men in front of a crowd of around 10,000. The hosts played some tidy football but needed a moment of class from Sarayoot Chaikamdee in the 73rd minute. Both sides missed enough chances to ensure that the benches were treated to some choice Anglo-Saxon expressions but at full-time, the tracksuited Robson warmly shook hands with the more formally dressed Houghton. The previous day in the lobby of the Radisson Hotel, they had sat together and swapped tales of Bangkok, Delhi and other Asian destinations. There are many on the CV of the well-travelled Houghton, the former Fulham midfielder who led Sweden&apos;s Malmo to a 1979 European Cup final defeat against Nottingham Forest. Even as cosmopolitan a manager as the 62-year-old, though, can find it hard to shake off certain national stereotypes and in the pre-match press conference an Indian journalist asked if fans would see an English-style game. &quot;Some of the less well-informed [observers] overseas always assume that if you are a English coach then you want to play like Wimbledon,&quot; Houghton said. &quot;It would help if the national team was successful as after the World Cup as people chase the successful styles.&quot; That is especially true on a continent that may love the Premier League but is less enthusiastic about English managers. Robson&apos;s exploits as a player give him an advantage over most of his countrymen, including Peter Reid \u2013 who he succeeded in September 2009. &quot;The main thing was my connection with Manchester United, it makes it easier with the players,&quot; Robson said. &quot;They give you respect straight away because they know you because of your international career and because you have played in the Premier League.&quot; Playing there is a dream of many an Asian player. Houghton is doubtful that any of his current crop is ready for England&apos;s top tier, though the one-time Queens Park Rangers target Sunil Chhetri was impressive in Bangkok, but Robson believes that the Thai national team contains a couple who could make the switch to the Championship at least. &quot;If I go back to my last job with Sheffield United, I would say that the Thai international players here, technique-wise, are better. Control of the ball, the passing and the movement is very good.&quot; That much was evident against India as the Thais, never easy to beat on home turf, built from the back and stroked the ball around nicely before struggling, as they always tend to do, in front of goal. Robson believes that there are other weaknesses that need to be addressed. &quot;On the defending side and the physical aspect then they fall a lot short of Sheffield United,&quot; he added. &quot;Part of the problem is the development of the power and the size of the Europeans and Africans compared to the nations around here.&quot; Houghton agrees. &quot;The average height of the players in the 2006 World Cup final, of the 22 players that started the game, was around 6ft 1in,&quot; he said. &quot;Our average height was 5ft 7in. So we have had to work hard to find one or two bigger ones. We found one or two only. When an Englishman says that in India, everyone says: &apos;you see, he wants to play the long ball&apos;. That&apos;s not true as Baichung Bhutia and Sunil Chhetri would always play for us and they are 5ft 6in but you can&apos;t play 11 that size. People forget that Thierry Henry is 6ft 3in.&quot; Also not high is India&apos;s Fifa ranking, the Bhangra Boys sitting 34 places below Thailand in 138th and a long way behind the likes of South Korea and Australia. How far behind the latter two they are on the pitch will be seen in January in the group stage of the 2011 Asian Cup. It&apos;s India&apos;s first appearance in the tournament since 1984 and Houghton knows that playing the continent&apos;s best could be a double-edged sword. &quot;There is a view that it will be good for Indian football as it will put ourselves in the spotlight and we will play against teams that have just played in the World Cup,&quot; he said. &quot;Or it could show people where we really are and that might set the game back. We really are in the infancy of trying to become a football country.&quot; Thailand are a little more mature as this display demonstrated but have yet to break out of south-east Asia and become a continental power.

Is industrial action justified? Are commuters right to complain? Ahead of next week&apos;s Trades Union Congress, we asked Comment is free readers to share their experience and write around the topic of strikes as part of our People&apos;s panel series (you can read our previous panels here). Because of the personal nature of the debate, moderation will be strict. Kate Belgrave aka k8thegr8       One thing that all trade union organisers know is that workers are generally very reluctant to go on strike. They want problems sorted out round the negotiating table. Which is fair enough, people have families to feed. They don&apos;t want to risk their jobs or bring themselves to the negative attention of management unless they have to.Nobody goes through the process for kicks. They go through it because things at work are becoming impossible. Take the Fremantle care workers in north London. Once employed by Barnet council, these care workers got a new employer in the Fremantle Trust when the council outsourced care services. In 2006, the care workers got a letter stating that their weekend enhancement pay would be cut. The trust also cut annual leave, and reduced sick leave. I followed the care workers&apos; case for two years as the women took the trust on in a dispute that they never wanted to have. Lango Gamanga, one of the care workers, explained at the time: &quot;I said to management \u2013 how do you expect us to be able to cope with these cuts? Management said that you have to do extra hours to make up your pay. But what about the quality of our life?&quot; Another care worker, Sandra Jones, continued: &quot;I came here all those years ago and I worked hard and then I got more leave and more wages. I&apos;m 48 now. I don&apos;t want to go back to how I was when I was 30. We&apos;re not asking for a pay rise. We&apos;re just asking for what we had.&quot; That&apos;s why people strike. They don&apos;t strike because they&apos;re greedy, or lazy. Ranjit Sidhu aka SiD123       My father had family and society as his most cherished values. Like many other 60s immigrants from the Indian subcontinent, he fitted into the trade union movement with ease. But I remember vividly his sadness and anger at the closure of part of the glass factory in which he worked \u2013 the inactive machines had been ruined by the strike that had been called. His bitterness was directed at the union. As a family man, he wondered how the union was blind to the harm that striking was causing \u2013 hurting most those who they said they wanted to protect. As early as the 1860s, Robert Applegarth, general secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners, told the London Trades Council &quot;never surrender the right to strike, but be careful how you use a double-edged weapon&quot;. The strike&apos;s double edge also hurts the public \u2013 with every strike the sympathy of the public dwindles and any goodwill generated is soon lost by the inconvenience caused. The unions need to invent a new way to engage with the public and realise that the battle will only be won with the soft power of public pressure rather than the hammer of the strike. My idea is quiet strikes, taking the lead from the non-violent protest movement. With a quiet strike, unions would, as they do now, have a ballot. They could inform the public that a strike has been called and a date set. On that day, all union members would go in as usual, but wearing an armband to show that they are part of the strike. The contrast between the old-fashioned strike would be stark. Instead of being seen as irresponsible, the union would be seen as the protectors of jobs. Instead of the strike being seen as an out-of-date act against the needs of the general public, it would be seen as a decent act of demonstration. In these days of economic strife and public-service cuts being dictated by the city, this country needs a more intelligent and socially sensitive union movement \u2013 one that is not interested in aggressive power plays, but socially orientated protesting and debate. A change of focus is needed: a quiet strike would resonate loudly. smellthecoffee       I joined the Communications Workers Union (CWU) in 1998 while working for Excell Multimedia in Glasgow, in a call centre that dealt with 999 calls. I spent nine hours a day stuck in front of a screen, taking 600 calls a day. I earned \u00a34.40 an hour, and a maximum monthly bonus of \u00a3224. Then one month, the maximum bonus was slashed to \u00a360. We formed a union, and started getting publicity about the conditions. Two union members appeared on Channel 4 news, complaining about them. In March 2000, Excell&apos;s contract with Cable and Wireless was abruptly terminated and Vertex took over. The union entered into a partnership agreement with them and employees voted overwhelmingly to be represented by the CWU. The workers had won. Collectively we can change things, but it takes guts, patience and determination. Now with the global crisis there are so many excuses for cutting wages and worsening conditions. Tim Skellett aka TimSkellett       Years ago, I worked in a large heavy industry factory where various grievances among the workforce reached a peak. The then shop-floor steward was voted out. Three new shop-floor stewards (including me) were voted in, and after some organising it was voted by a large margin to strike. This was the first strike ever in that factory, and for a while it did not look like it would be successful. My two fellow shop-floor stewards were less than helpful \u2013 one was a member of a Trotskyist party, largely only interested in presenting non-negotiable demands that management simply could not fulfil. He regarded any kind of negotiated settlement as being a sell-out, and contrary to his party&apos;s revolutionary aims. The other fellow was self-pitying, and went around moaning about how we were bound to fail. With the help of an organiser from the union&apos;s headquarters, we mounted a PR campaign advertising the fact that the company was in good financial health. We detailed the workers&apos; grievances and maintained picketing. Much of my work lay in continually talking with strikers, convincing them that we could win. After much negotiation, we won a pay raise plus contributions towards workers&apos; pensions. Overall, when leading a strike, one must learn to negotiate and set attainable goals. You need to decide well beforehand what your absolute bottom line is, and what actions you will undertake if that bottom line is breached. You need to keep negotiations and PR factual and free from excessive emotion. You need to present a good case, not only to the workers you are representing and to the company in negotiations, but also to the public. Guardian contributor and Royal Mail employee Roy Mayall provides a good model of how to present a case. You need to keep in mind too that some who claim to be on your side and to know what&apos;s best will be your worst enemies. Finally, remember there are many factions; middle and lower management may undertake actions that are vindictive, but which are not representative of top management and are unimportant in the long run. Anna Rosario Elicano aka anneelicano       I&apos;m an intern for a publishing company and, despite leaving an extra hour early for work, i was still an hour and a half late on the day of the London Underground strike this week. Getting home was also hellish. I was due to take an online exam for a really good post with an international organization in Bangkok (which I was long-listed for) at 6pm but got home long after that. I rushed through the exam and, now, can only hope that they still consider my application given the circumstances. Being an unemployed new graduate, you can imagine how dismayed I am about that. I commiserate with workers who strike, and respect their right to do so. At the end of the day, I&apos;d rather bear the inconvenience of traffic jams and getting home late rather than have this right taken away. But I wish there was a way they could express their concerns without affecting other workers (although I can&apos;t even define myself as a worker yet, can I) who are also trying hard to get by. \u2022 Next week, to coincide with the Pope&apos;s visit to Britain and following suggestions by readers Mounteverest and ch27, our readers&apos; panel will focus on Catholicism.

Higher up is the electronics department: the fake Rolexes and the cheap TVs. On the seventh floor is the gorilla. There are no trees in &quot;King Kong&apos;s&quot; 15 x 10 metres concrete enclosure, just a tyre and a few ropes hanging from the low ceiling. He moves little, spending long hours sitting at the front of his pen, gripping the iron bars. Ten metres away, a lone penguin stands in an air-conditioned pen, next to a pool of water, which is smaller than a bath and nowhere near deep enough for him to swim in. A few years ago, there were a dozen penguins, but only this one survives. Bangkok&apos;s Pata zoo sits atop the department store that shares its name, on a busy road in the northern suburbs of Bangkok. Crammed into cages and pens across the sixth and seventh floor of the ageing building are more than 200 species: a menagerie of pythons, turtles, flamingos, monkeys, leopards, tigers, bears, and even a Shetland pony. From the rooftop enclosures, you can see the advertising billboards and office blocks next door, while traffic roars past below. The director of the Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand, Edwin Wiek, wants the zoo closed: &quot;Basically, it is an animal prison on top of a shopping mall. The space is too small, the animals have very little room, there is very little sunlight, the enclosures are dirty, they smell bad, and people are coming past all day, getting far too close to the animals, which makes the animals extremely stressed. In 200 steps you can see 50 different species. Most people know that this is not an acceptable way to keep animals. It is a hell for animals.&quot; Thailand, like much of south-east Asia, faces myriad animal welfare issues: cockfighting remains a popular, hardly-underground spectator sport, elephants are still put to work on the traffic-choked streets of Bangkok, and the city remains a hub for smuggling animals across the world. Last month a sedated tiger cub was discovered in a bag at Suvarnabhumi airport disguised amongst soft animal toys. But Pata zoo reflects the fundamental problem: a lack of legislation regarding animal welfare. The zoo is breaking no laws. The animals were all obtained legally, and the zoo&apos;s licence was recently extended. All the same, staff don&apos;t like the animals being filmed or photographed in their cages. The Guardian visited twice to obtain its footage, and both times we were encouraged to move on if we stayed too long at one enclosure. &quot;There are no rules or regulations to say how much space each animal needs,&quot; said the director, Kanit Sermsirimongkol. &quot;It&apos;s not about space, it&apos;s about the way in which you treat the animals. The space that we provide to the animals is enough for them to freely move around, and to exercise. The zoo has a vet to take care of the animals. And we have many species of animals successfully breeding, which shows the animals are healthy and well-managed.&quot; Kanit says the zoo is a respite for people looking to escape the &quot;concrete jungle&quot; of Bangkok and to &quot;reconnect with nature&quot;. He says the animals are especially popular with children. Earlier this year, Thailand&apos;s ministry of natural resources and environment declared its support in principle for a universal declaration on animal welfare, and a draft act on the prevention of cruelty to animals has been written, but in Thailand&apos;s current unstable political climate, the legislation is unlikely to be passed. &quot;There is an animal welfare law in Thailand, but it is very simple, very ineffective, and is rarely enforced,&quot; Wiek said. &quot;It says only that if you torture an animal, you can be fined. And the maximum is 1,000 baht (\u00a320). That&apos;s not a tool, that&apos;s a joke.&quot; Pata zoo has been in Bangkok for nearly 30 years, but attitudes towards animal welfare are changing. Business is slow. During the three hours the Guardian spent there, there were barely 20 visitors. The lunchtime &quot;performance&quot;, featuring primates who lift weights, ride bicycles, and fight with knives, drew fewer than a dozen people to an auditorium built for several hundred. The building is tired and run down, latches are broken on empty cages, abandoned enclosures are filthy. A handful of jackals, held in a tiny concrete room, are barely visible through the grimy viewing window. Across a narrow corridor from King Kong, two orangutans share a sparse enclosure, concreted on all sides apartfrom the iron bars at the front. Here, too, there are no trees or any greenery. The orangutans have learned to beg for food, reaching their long arms through the bars of their cage, clapping their hands as they shriek at visitors. Several years ago there was a second indoor zoo in Bangkok, but all the animals died when the building caught fire, said Roger Lohanan, chairman of Thailand&apos;s animal guardian association. &quot;Pata is an old building.

This seems an overly onerous condition for what is quite an expensive insurance policy. The photo you sent to us suggests some evidence of a break-in but, equally, the door is not hanging off its hinges. We asked JLT to look at the case again, but it still refuses to pay your claim. We suggest you take your case to the Financial Ombudsman Service and ask it to look at whether this term is reasonable and sufficiently advertised in the insurance paperwork.

But the song is literally untouchable to me. It&apos;s divine. Whether it&apos;s this genre or that genre, whether it&apos;s current or not current: it&apos;s the songs. The songs last forever.&quot; Since his rich, honeyed baritone was first heard in 1990, when Killer, a single with the techno DJ Adamski, became a huge hit, the voice of Seal Henry Samuel has been synonymous with some of the biggest-selling and most inescapable songs in pop, even as he has remained notably absent from the churn of celebrity. As he enthusiastically talks up his sixth album of self-written material, the nature of songwriting is very much on his mind. But even he is sometimes taken by surprise. &quot;I wrote A Kiss from a Rose really early on, about 25 years ago, and I didn&apos;t know that would resonate with people like it did,&quot; he says. &quot;I thought it was crap.&quot; Along with Killer, and Crazy, his first solo single, A Kiss from a Rose is perhaps Seal&apos;s best-known song. It won three Grammys \u2013 four if you include the one for producer Trevor Horn \u2013 and helped propel sales of his second album past the 6m mark in 1994. But nothing about its creation was straightforward. First there was the writing. &quot;I couldn&apos;t play an instrument at the time, so I tried to emulate all the different instruments on a little four-track [tape recorder],&quot; he says. Once finished, he &quot;threw the tape in a corner and never listened to it&quot;, not even bothering to consider it for inclusion on his 1991 debut album. When, two years later, Horn insisted he record it, Seal remained sceptical. &quot;I still didn&apos;t like it, and I convinced Trevor that it wasn&apos;t any good and we took it off the album,&quot; he says. &quot;I thought it was too flowery and that it didn&apos;t fit.&quot; Seal reinstated it only after fashion PR Lynne Franks told him she liked it, but the song flopped when first released as a single, and was rejected when Seal&apos;s manager submitted it to soundtrack a love scene between Nicole Kidman and Val Kilmer in Batman Forever. But the director liked it and chose to play the song over the end credits: &quot;And 7m albums later,&quot; Seal grins, &quot;I owe my career to Joel Schumacher.&quot; Success against both odds and expectations, and overcoming obstacles sometimes of his own creation, could be said to be as much hallmarks of Seal&apos;s career as a voice that&apos;s among the most distinctive instruments in pop. While today, at 47, he lives the quintessential A-list life \u2013 married to a supermodel, with homes in Beverly Hills and Mexico, still selling records by the million \u2013 his life was unsettled from the start. Born in London to a Nigerian mother and Brazilian father, Seal was immediately placed with foster parents in Essex. He returned to his biological family, including a strict, physically abusive father, when he was four. The first inklings of a musical career came when he found himself singing I Can See Clearly Now at a school concert, aged 11. &quot;My parents had never heard me sing before,&quot; he recalls. &quot;There wasn&apos;t a great deal of communication in the house. There was this really cool teacher who I idolised \u2013 I certainly didn&apos;t idolise my father \u2013 and he always used to say, &apos;You&apos;ve got a really good voice&apos;. I would never really take his word for it, but he got me to sing on stage. I remember closing my eyes and singing, and at the end of it, everyone&apos;s clapping, and I opened my eyes and there was a look of disbelief on my parents&apos; faces. And at that point I knew.&quot; Some time before his father&apos;s death, when Seal was\u00a017, he had opted for homelessness rather than\u00a0stay with his family; he put himself through an architecture course while living in squats and sleeping rough. Music remained nothing more than a vague dream, his singing becoming &quot;sort of like the party trick that I would do when I was among friends. And I&apos;d hear it every time, &apos;Wow, I never knew you could sing! You ever thought of doing that?&apos;&quot; When he was 23, a girlfriend heard him sing for the first time, and &quot;marched me down to Tottenham Court Road and bought me a bass guitar, a drum machine and a four-track and said, &apos;That&apos;s what you should be doing. You&apos;re wasting your time. Get on with it.&apos; She sort of bullied me into it.&quot; He began making demos, but something was missing. &quot;The record companies would say the same thing, &apos;He&apos;s got an interesting voice, but I&apos;m not quite sure what he is.&apos; And they were right. I had no identity. I could sing, but I had no voice.&quot; A friend, Greg Roberts, drummer with Big Audio Dynamite, gave Seal a tape, containing tracks by Sly and the Family Stone, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and Crosby, Stills and Nash. Suddenly he understood what he lacked. &quot;It became so apparent to me why I couldn&apos;t get signed, so I stopped writing music for a year,&quot; he says. &quot;I went out and bought everything those artists did, everything I could lay my hands on, and they became my Bible.&quot; The first song he wrote after his year of research was Crazy, but before he could do anything with it, a London funk band, Push, made him an offer he couldn&apos;t refuse. &quot;They said, &apos;Polydor are gonna give us \u00a32,000 each if we do four gigs in Japan&apos;,&quot; he remembers. &quot;So I joined the band, just for two weeks. But then the keyboard player said, &apos;Let&apos;s stop in Thailand on the way back&apos;. As soon as I set foot in Bangkok I just knew I wasn&apos;t going home.&quot; He spent a year in Asia, returning to Bangkok to guest with a blues band in an expat bar every time his money ran out, each night&apos;s pay keeping him afloat for another few weeks. Between gigs he wrote the songs that would form the backbone of his 4m-selling debut album \u2013 songs that often dealt with the euphoria of finding your own path through life, and the loneliness that came with being compelled to follow it. Seal finally returned to London in 1989, in time for the summer of acid house. Excited by the techno and dance scenes, he met DJ and producer Adam &quot;Adamski&quot; Tinley, and teamed up with him to put lyrics and melody to one of Tinley&apos;s more ruminative backing tracks. Killer spent a month at No 1; suddenly, every label in London wanted to sign him. He opted to go with ZTT and record with its founder, Trevor Horn, whose work with Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Grace Jones had helped show that the studio was as important an instrument in pop as guitar, bass, drums or keyboards. Seal made five LPs with Horn \u2013 one remains unreleased \u2013 which turned the rave-era one-hit wonder into a global star. The sometimes fractious relationship can be seen as the first in a series he has had with men who became surrogates for the father he&apos;d never really had. &quot;If I was being brutally honest, then, yeah, I needed Trevor,&quot; he says. &quot;It would be foolish of me to say otherwise. But I&apos;ve had that with managers, too, and it&apos;s led to complications, because of not taking responsibility, not taking ownership and control of my career. One manager ended up stealing from me and ripping me off, but that&apos;s because I didn&apos;t have my eyes open, because I put my trust in a father figure rather than a manager. &quot;I&apos;ve learned the hard way that the only person who is gonna make it happen is you,&quot; he continues, &quot;in the same way that I made the first album happen. Trevor produced a great record, but I tell you what, mate: I lived and breathed that first record. They used to have to send me home - I would fall asleep on the back couch in the studio. I wouldn&apos;t let it go.&quot; He&apos;s happy now in a new working relationship, with the producer David Foster, who helmed Soul, a\u00a0collection of cover versions he released in 2008 that has sold more than 4m copies. &quot;He&apos;s a genius,&quot; Seal says of Foster. &quot;People throw that word around, but I don&apos;t.&quot; Building on Soul&apos;s foundations, the new record, Commitment, retains an organic approach, eschewing the techno flourishes of 2007&apos;s\u00a0System or the widescreen epics he made with Horn. His main home is in Los Angeles, where he lives with his wife of five years, Heidi Klum, and their four children (three from their relationship; he has formally adopted the eldest, whose father is former formula one team-owner Flavio Briatore). He credits Klum, to whom he proposed in an igloo he built at 12,000 feet up a mountain in Canada, with helping him keep his songwriting simple. Commitment is as much about looking back to who he was as celebrating the contentment he feels today. Seal came to the sessions with 41 songs at least partly written \u2013 unprecedented for an artist who would struggle to come up with a dozen strong ideas every three or four years. &quot;What&apos;s changed is me,&quot; he says. &quot;Trevor and David were dealing with two different\u00a0people.&quot; Seal is still driven by his perfectionist muse, but family life has meant rethinking his priorities. Rather than booking a studio, he rented a house in the town of Montecito, with the plan being to live there while recording. But the pursuit\u00a0of art had\u00a0to take second place to his responsibilities as husband and father. &quot;It was just an hour away from Los Angeles,&quot; he says of the house-turned-studio, &quot;so I did come home, to be with my family. [Music] is something that you love doing, but second to the thing that you really love, which is your wife and kids. I mean, it&apos;s only music \u2013 it&apos;s not that\u00a0important.&quot; Seal VI: Commitment is reviewed on page 13", "publicationDate": "2010-09-16T22:00:51Z", "tags": ["Music", "Culture", "Pop and rock"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/sep/16/seal-interview-pop", "title": "Seal: The reluctant pop star", "sentences": ["As soon as I set foot in Bangkok I just knew I wasn&apos;t going home.&quot; He spent a year in Asia, returning to Bangkok to guest with a blues band in an expat bar every time his money ran out, each night&apos;s pay keeping him afloat for another few weeks."]}, {"article": "After hacking through undergrowth for a couple of hours, we emerged sweaty, muddy and bedraggled at the 25m-high Tok Haew Narok falls, which (please excuse yet another reference to The Beach in a Thailand article) are the ones Leonardo DiCaprio leapt from in the film. We scrambled down to swim in the turquoise pool below it. My guide \u2013 called Apple \u2013 and I were following a challenging 8km trail through the Khao Yai national park, a huge tract of monsoon forest and a Unesco world heritage site two hours north of Bangkok. On the western edge of the Isaan region, it is home to tigers, bears, leopards, deer, gibbons, hornbills and elephants. The Isaan region covers a huge swathe of north-east Thailand stretching to the Mekong river, Laos and Cambodia. It is the country&apos;s least visited area \u2013 as close to the &quot;old Thailand&quot; as you can get, and a welcome change from the tour group- and backpacker-choked northern destinations of Chiang Mai and the Golden Triangle. Boutique hotels are few and far between, a steaming broth of noodle soup replaces the banana pancake breakfast, and pedicabs rather than taxis or tuk-tuks are the main mode of transport. I encountered sleepy, small rural towns that depend on farming, not tourism, despite the fact that this area is not only a stunning natural wilderness, but also full of fantastic Khmer temples. Just like those in Cambodia (including Angkor Wat), the 182 Khmer sites in Isaan were built by the God Kings of Angkor, who at the height of their supremacy, from the ninth to the 13th century, extended their empire into Burma. Many of the finest examples of Khmer architecture are to be found on Issan&apos;s Khorat Plateau, clustered around Buriram, Surin and Khorat provinces. I explored many of them and, more often than not, I had them pretty much to myself.     Making a splash \u2026 Tok Haew Narok waterfall. Photograph: Alamy    The jewel in the crown was undoubtedly Phimai, 60 miles north-east of Khorat, less than three hours from Bangkok. The temple complex is right in the heart of the otherwise humdrum little town of Phimai, and entering it is like walking into a secret, mythical garden. The whole complex is dominated by an exquisite prang (tower), the iconic corn-on-the-cob-like Khmer structure \u2013 in fact, some claim that Angkor Wat was modelled on Phimai. Apple and I sat, cocooned in a soporific tropical haze, transfixed, as the sandstone of the temple absorbed the last rays of the weakening sun, and were joined by a group of novice monks in saffron robes, who imparted spiritual wisdom about Lampard and Rooney. The next morning we were up at dawn for a two-hour drive east across the flat, dusty landscape of the Khorat Plateau to another great Thai Khmer monument, Phanom Rung. Although Isaan is a vast region, distances between the Khmer temples are short, and all the main sites can be seen in a couple of days. Phanom Rung is perched atop an extinct volcano, with panoramic views of the surrounding plain, and I climbed up steps worn down by centuries of visiting Buddhist pilgrims to a promenade overlooking the exquisite sandstone tower of the main temple, with its labyrinth of hidden chambers. A few miles on was the Meuang Tam complex, based on the design of Angkor Wat, but with four L-shaped ponds covered with colourful lotus flowers. I ventured east next, towards the Mekong valley, into rural landscapes full of paddy fields broken up by palm trees \u2013 Thailand is the world&apos;s largest rice exporter and much of the crop is grown in Isaan. Isaan hot is a different kettle of spice from regular Thai hot as I found out when I ordered larb moo (minced pork salad) in a small roadside restaurant. Several hours later we had made it to Khong Jiam, a somnolent river town, beautifully located on a peninsula where the blue waters of the river Mun are overwhelmed by the bubbling chocolate that is the Mekong. After staying in many basic rural lodges during our journey, I was overjoyed to find a boutique hotel here, the Tohsang Khong Jiam, right on the bank of the Mekong, with enchanting views of the mountains of Laos on the other side. Leaving Kong Jiam to head back to Bangkok, we stumbled upon Wat Tham Khuha Sawan, which overlooks the town and the river. In complete contrast to the bewitching Khmer temples, this modern temple, built in 1978, has a surreal theme park feel to it, with a mish-mash of flamboyant architectural styles. A huge elephant protects the Buddha images below, and the main stupa&apos;s golden spires wink conspiratorially in the dazzling light. There is a dreamlike bell tower, topped with fierce nagas (mythical serpent deities) and golden spires.

A rubbish truck rumbles along the potholed road. An emaciated Chinese man with ribs like chopsticks drags his feet along the wet cement. A rat trots along the pavement with something yellow in its teeth, past our cook and inside the shutters of the premises next door. Welcome to Bangkok&apos;s Chinatown, home of one of the world&apos;s most piquant culinary experiences. Our guide is David Thompson \u2013 an Australian who has spent the best part of 25 years researching, cooking and evangelising about Thai food: who was awarded the first Michelin star in Europe for a Thai restaurant and was the author of Thai Food \u2013 which made the Top 10 of OFM&apos;s list of the best ever cookbooks last month. Thompson has taken us on a 60-minute bumper-to-bumper cab journey across Bangkok&apos;s endless flyovers to sample some of the best street food the city can offer. Most of the streets are littered with stalls, stands and trucks, and Thompson has homed in on one. A hole in the wall, featuring a charcoal-heated wok that he reckons &quot;hasn&apos;t been cleaned in 50 years&quot;. A fluent Thai speaker, Thompson&apos;s understanding of the culture often astonishes the locals. He orders everyone \u2013 that&apos;s the Observer photographer and me \u2013 the oyster omelette. We sit on plastic stools and wait. We&apos;re the only farang or westerners around; as we are for the rest of the night. The omelettes arrive on plastic plates in various colours, with a finger bowl of chilli sauce. Cooking oysters has always seemed like a waste of carbon to me so my hopes are low, but they are rescued by what Thompson calls the &quot;right mucosity&quot; and crunch made possible by the searing wok. The chilli sauce is surprisingly anodyne and sweet; Thompson says he wishes he had the &quot;audacity to bring my own&quot;. Yet for 60 baht (just over a quid) a pop it would be &quot;discourteous&quot;. Half a dozen other dishes are advertised here but all of our fellow diners choose the omelette. &quot;If you ordered anything else they&apos;d get confused, probably forgotten how to cook it,&quot; says Thompson. And this is how Thai street food operates. A stall or a truck gets a reputation for the best gung pat sadtor (stir-fried sadtor beans with prawns, shrimp paste and pork) or somesuch and word spreads; they may also do other meals but the queues will be for the prawn dish. The knowledgeable will also walk on if the wrong family member is wok-side. The middle sister might be stingy with the fish sauce, and given the complex sweet, sour, salt and hot spicing of Thai dishes, the whole taste structure crumbles. But if you want another course, you need another stall. Luckily Thompson has a plan: mains are up the road. &quot;I&apos;ve got us a table in the best section, in the gutter,&quot; he says with characteristic mischief. At this stall, Thompson feels confident enough to order a selection of dishes. The star attraction is slices of duck smoked over sugar cane. And there are plastic plates of pork stir-fried with Chinese olives (&quot;I&apos;m buggered if I know what they are,&quot; says Thompson), braised duck intestines (&quot;It tastes like soft rubber bands, which is actually OK&quot;) and what turns out to be ever-present over our two days in Bangkok \u2013 a pungent red catfish curry. To spice things up further we are supplied with finger bowls of fish sauce and chillies; to mollify the heat, bowls of sticky rice; for a break from the heat, plates of raw Chinese cabbage, holy basil and sadtor beans; and to wash the heat away, Singha beer. Thompson, who has been with his Thai partner in business and life, Tanongsak Yordwai, for 24 years, holds forth on the plight of the euro and gives his neo-Marxist analysis of the Thai political system. Soon the chatter fades in favour of the food. &quot;This is not bad for something on a plastic plate,&quot; says Thompson. So how did a 51-year-old Australian end up a world authority on Thai cooking? Thompson&apos;s training began in Sydney&apos;s French restaurants in the early 80s, but in 1986 after a holiday in Thailand his head was turned. He returned to Bangkok, spending two years learning all he could about Thai food. Which was tricky as there were no recipe books to study \u2013 dishes were passed down the generations. But Thompson found a teacher called Khun Sombat Janphetchara who had learned to cook at a royal palace. &quot;In her hands the commonplace was transformed into something memorable,&quot; he says. He began to collect memorial books, published when a Thai died and which often included their favourite recipes. He returned to Australia and opened a couple of celebrated Thai restaurants in Sydney. But in 2000 Thailand lured him back to consult at the government-backed Suan Dusit academy of Thai cooking \u2013 instructing chefs in the history and preparation of authentic Thai dishes. A year later he opened Nahm at the Halkin Hotel in London and in 2002 it became the first Thai restaurant to win a Michelin star. In the same year he published Thai Food \u2013 an exhaustive work that ran to nearly 700 pages. The 117-page introduction emphasised how Thai cuisine had evolved through migration, custom and economics \u2013 in many ways Thai Food is as much a cultural history as a recipe book. The obvious question is why has it taken an Australian to win respect for Thai cuisine? Fuchsia Dunlop, who has explored China to write award-winning titles including Sichuan Cookery, says there are advantages to being an alien. &quot;Sometimes it is outsiders who are interested in the older things, the traditions. As a foreigner you know what needs to be explained, what&apos;s appealing and what will freak people out. To be a kind of bridge, it helps not to be a local.&quot; Thompson&apos;s latest venture is perhaps his most ambitious: to open a Thai restaurant in Bangkok. In the space previously occupied by a Mediterranean restaurant, he is opening a new Nahm in the chic environs of the Metropolitan hotel. Hotel reception staff say they are pleased since they won&apos;t have to send foreign guests away when they ask to eat Thai food. The opening has been delayed: the red shirt riots took place a block away which meant building slowed down; training chefs and creating a menu is taking perfectionist Thompson longer than expected \u2013 &quot;I have one or two chefs who look at me with a degree of circumspection I find almost impertinent.&quot; Earlier in the day, while builders work on the interior of the main dining room, Thompson and his team let the hotel staff and the Observer sample some curry dishes which he insists are only &quot;60-70% there&quot;. He is most proud of a fish stomach curry, a dish that originates from the 1920s. Made from salted mackerel innards, chicken livers, cockles and a lot of chilli, it is an elemental combination of earth and fire. You might like to know the innards are discarded before serving. There&apos;s also a grilled beef curry with chilli leaves, catfish nahm prik pao and a milder coconut crab curry. With each mouthful the eyes start to combust, &quot;It&apos;s when the eardrums start to hurt that you know you&apos;ve eaten enough chilli,&quot; says our chef. One of the hotel staff says the food is like her grandmother used to make, which for Thompson couldn&apos;t be a finer compliment. &quot;Food from that older generation is better, stronger. To get those undulant tastes that strike a deep chord rather than the superficial tastes you get with modern food, that for me is exciting, it&apos;s almost like I&apos;m a culinary archeologist. &quot;Thai food ain&apos;t about simplicity. It&apos;s about the juggling of disparate elements to create a harmonious finish. Like a complex musical chord it&apos;s got to have a smooth surface but it doesn&apos;t matter what&apos;s happening underneath. Simplicity isn&apos;t the dictum here, at all. Some westerners think it&apos;s a jumble of flavours, but to a Thai that&apos;s important, it&apos;s the complexity they delight in.&quot; Back to the evening downtown and we have moved on to dessert. Thompson has bought ripe durian, &quot;the foie gras of fruit&quot;, from one stall \u2013 a fruit with an odour so pungent that Anthony Bourdain described it as &quot;like french kissing your dead grandmother&quot; \u2013 and ordered black sesame dumplings in fresh ginger from another. We devour the yellow garlicky ectoplasm \u2013 and the rich roasted seeds and sharp rhizome liquid of the second dessert make a great sweet and sour palate cleanser. The food in Nahm is pure archive Thai, but the food we&apos;ve been eating on the street stalls is a hybrid of Thai, Chinese and Malay \u2013 reflecting the waves of immigration, or as Thompson elegantly puts it, &quot;the people pass through and the residue is the cuisine they leave behind&quot;. In Thompson&apos;s early years in Bangkok he would pass over these fusion dishes. Truth be told, despite its appearance in both of his books, he&apos;s a bit sniffy about pat thai \u2013 a dish that was created in the 1940s in response to a government competition. He says that if you ask for it at Nahm you are presented with the bill. But his attitude to street food has softened and he claims to eat little else. A couple of generations ago, Thais were rural folk who ate at home and took pride in offering food to the monks, but as they have moved to the cities they are likely to grab a polythene bag of curry on the way home to reheat. There is almost a stigma attached to cooking for yourself. &quot;There is an embarrassment about spending time in the kitchen, it is seen as old-fashioned and a sign that you haven&apos;t made it. Sometimes I know how they feel,&quot; Thompson jokes. But for those of us not lucky enough to have these avenues of edibles at our front doors, Thompson has written Thai Street Food \u2013 a tribute to the stallholders and their hyphenated dishes. He was going to open a street food restaurant in London but that fell victim to the credit crunch, so I&apos;m left with no alternative but to try to recreate the experience in my kitchen. First, I must go to London&apos;s Chinatown to gather staples of Thai cooking: fish sauce, shrimp paste, white pepper, palm sugar, dried shrimp, sticky rice, pat thai noodles, siracha chilli sauce \u2013 all for around a third of the price and for three times the quantity than at a supermarket. I decide to cook the dish that has a list of ingredients on the briefer side, the stir-fried minced beef with chillies and holy basil. Getting a wok hot enough on a domestic gas hob to give the meat a tasty singe is tricky \u2013 although a fattier cut than sirloin or smaller pieces might have been a better move. And although I opt for the low-end when it comes to numbers of scuds, the chilli overpowers the holy basil \u2013 but there&apos;s definitely something oddly soothing about the spicy, eggy, beefy, rice pudding-like result. My guinea pig friend is defeated by the heat once she ladles on the fish and chilli sauce \u2013 I suspect punters on Yaowarat Road wouldn&apos;t be so sissy. I resolve to try again with more basil, fattier morsels of meat and fewer chillies. Next evening I try the Thai fried rice, substituting shallots for spring onions and crayfish for crab meat \u2013 and the results look and taste pretty delicious. The salt, black pepper and soy seasoning is way more subtle and I&apos;m disappointed there&apos;s not enough for seconds.

Along the street there are small grills, often just a large metal bowl with a rack perched on top. I&apos;ll stop and look and long for the fruits of their labour \u2013 smoky grilled skewers of pork. I&apos;ll smuggle some home as if carrying a guilty secret to relish in private. Sometimes, most of the time, I&apos;ll break into the cache on the way home. Grilling is one of the more popular techniques of the streets, where there are many ad hoc pieces of equipment and the grill is one of the most common. They are everywhere, grilling pork, satays, dumplings and squid. Using a charcoal grill imparts a depth of flavour that makes meat such as this grilled pork irresistible. It is important to light the grill 30-60 minutes before using and allow the coals to burn until they glow gently. If you have a charcoal grill you&apos;ll know how long it takes to get to the right stage. Grilling over too high a heat will char and burn the pork before it is cooked and smoky. Very often there will be a small piece of pork fat at the bottom of the skewer. This helps to moisten the pork as it grills. The Thais use mangrove charcoal from near the mouth of the Chao Phraya River. Not everyone has a charcoal grill, however, and these pork skewers can also be cooked on a chargrill plate on the stove top or under a preheated grill. While the taste will be less complex, they will still be extremely agreeable. MAKES 12-15, ENOUGH FOR 4-5 pork loin or neck 300g pork back fat (optional) 50g bamboo skewers 12-15 coconut cream 4tbsp For the marinade:  coriander roots 1 tsp, cleaned and chopped pinch of salt garlic 1 tsp, chopped ground white pepper \u00bd tsp shaved palm sugar 2 tbsp dark soy sauce a dash fish sauce 2tbsp vegetable oil 2 tbsp Slice the pork into thinnish pieces about 2cm square. Cut the pork fat, if using, into rectangles, say 2cm x 5mm.     Grilled pork skewers. Photograph: Earl Carter    Next make the marinade. Using a pestle and mortar, pound the coriander root, salt, garlic and pepper into a fine paste. Combine with the sugar, soy sauce, fish sauce and oil. Marinate the pork and fat in this mixture for about 3 hours. The more cautious can refrigerate this but, if doing so, then it is best marinated overnight. It&apos;s a good idea to soak the bamboo skewers in water for about 30 minutes. This prevents them from scorching and burning as the pork grills. Prepare the grill. Meanwhile, thread a piece of pork fat, if using, on to the skewer first followed by two or three pieces of the marinated pork. Repeat with each skewer. When the embers are glowing, in fact beginning to die, gently grill the skewers, turning quite often to prevent charring and promote even caramelisation and cooking. Dab them with the coconut cream as they grill. This should make the coals smoulder and impart a smoky taste. Grill all the skewers. On the streets, they are reheated over the grill to warm them through before serving, but they are delicious warm or cool. PAT THAI      Pat Thai. Photograph: Earl Carter    This is a relatively new addition to the Thai repertoire, emerging during a period of ultra-nationalism in the late 1930s and early 40s, under the military regime of Marshal Phibun. He declared that the people should endeavour to incorporate noodles into their eating habits, so competitions were held to devise new recipes, including the winning one that included tamarind and palm sugar. It was given the name pat thai to distinguish it from Chinese noodle dishes, even though it has much in common with them. Thin, flat, quite chewy rice noodles are preferred here: fresh ones make a much better dish, but they are hard to find outside of Thailand. However, the dried version, also known as rice sticks, are readily obtainable. There is now a gentrified version of pat thai that uses fresh prawns. Add six medium-sized cleaned raw prawns as the shallots begin to fry \u2013 and omit the dried prawns later in the recipe. To make the tamarind water, break off an amount of the pulp, rinse, then cover in a similar amount of warm water and leave for a few minutes to soften. Squeeze and work the pulp to dissolve it, then strain the liquid to remove any fibres or seeds. It is best to make it quite thick, as it can be diluted. SERVES 2 fresh pat thai noodles 125g or dried thin rice noodles (rice sticks) 100g shaved palm sugar 3 tbsp tamarind water 2 tbsp white vinegar (optional) a dash fish sauce 1 tbsp oil 3 tbsp red shallots 4, coarsely chopped with a pinch of salt eggs (some cooks will use duck eggs) 2 yellow bean curd or firm bean curd 30g, cut into small rectangles or squares \u2013 about 2 heaped tbsp dried prawns 1 tbsp, rinsed and dried shredded salted radish \u00bd tsp, rinsed and dried roasted peanuts 1 tbsp, coarsely crushed trimmed bean sprouts a handful Chinese chives a handful cut into 2cm lengths To serve: extra bean sprouts and crushed roasted peanuts, lime wedges, roasted chilli powder and raw vegetables (such as Asian pennywort, banana blossom, cabbage or snake beans) If using dried noodles, soak them in water for about 15 minutes until soft but not overly so. Meanwhile, bring a pan of water to the boil. Drain the noodles well then blanch them in the boiling water for a moment only and drain once again (this prevents the noodles from clumping together when they are stir-fried). Mix the palm sugar with the tamarind water, vinegar (if using), fish sauce and 1-2 tablespoons of water in a bowl, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Heat the oil in a wok over a medium heat and fry the shallots until fragrant and beginning to colour. Crack in the eggs and stir for a few moments until they begin to look omelette-like. Turn up the heat, then add the drained noodles and fry for about 30 seconds while breaking up the eggs. Add the tamarind syrup and simmer until absorbed. Mix in the bean curd, dried prawns, salted radish and peanuts then simmer, stirring, until almost dry. Add the bean sprouts and Chinese chives and stir-fry for a moment. Check the seasoning: pat thai should be salty, sweet and sour. Divide between two plates and sprinkle with the extra bean sprouts and peanuts. Serve with lime wedges, roasted chilli powder and raw vegetables. SOUR ORANGE CURRY OF FISH (GENG SOM PLAA)     Sour orange curry. Photograph: Earl Carter    In every market in every town and village, there will be at least one or two local varieties of this thin, tart curry on sale, waiting in deep bowls filled with vegetables and pieces of fish. Each region has its own favourite fish for this: the meaty white flesh of the serpent-head fish, the catfish, the rich and fatty carp or crunchy featherbacks. On the coast, barramundi, sea bass and kingfish are preferred, but prawns and mussels are happily thrown into the pot, too. So there is ample scope to use perch, pike or zander. (If using freshwater fish, add a tablespoon of chopped galangal or grachai to the curry paste.) And from the sea try snapper, red emperor, bream, mussels or clams. Thais eat fish cooked whole or in large pieces, unperturbed by bones. They believe that fish tastes better so cooked \u2013 and they&apos;re right. However, you may prefer fillets. If possible, have the fishmonger fillet the fish for you, so you can have the bones for a stock. Otherwise use chicken stock or water. If you are making stock, scrape any flesh from the bones and add it to the curry paste. If you are using a fillet, poach a little of the fish in stock or water and add that to the paste. The vegetables used range widely as well: daikon (mooli), fresh or pickled mustard greens, water mimosa, torn betel leaves, baby corn, bamboo shoots, coarsely shredded semi-ripe papaya, heart of coconut or tart green pineapple. Often three or four are used together. SERVES 2-3 stock or water 750ml good pinch of salt  red shallots 5, peeled pinch of white sugar  fish sauce 2 tbsp tamarind water (see Pat Thai) 3 tbsp fish fillet 200g, cut into 3cm pieces Asian greens, such as Siamese watercress (water spinach), choy sum or Chinese cabbage a handful cut into 3cm lengths roasted chilli powder a pinch dried long red chillies (optional) 3, dry-roasted in a wok or frying pan Sour orange curry paste:  dried long red chillies 6 dried bird&apos;s eye chillies 3-4 good pinch of salt  bird&apos;s eye chillies, scuds (optional) a few chopped red shallots 2 tbsp Thai shrimp paste (gapi) 1 tsp poached fish 2-3 tbsp First make the curry paste. Nip off the stalks of the dried long red chillies, then cut along their length and scrape out the seeds. Soak the chillies in water for about 15 minutes until soft. Rinse the dried bird&apos;s eye chillies to remove any dust. Drain the chillies, squeezing to extract as much water as possible, then chop them quite finely. Using a pestle and mortar, pound the chillies to a paste with the salt, then add the remaining ingredients in the order they are listed, reducing each one to a fine paste before adding the next. Alternatively, pur\u00e9e them in a blender. You will probably need to add a little water to aid the blending, but try not to add more than necessary, as this will dilute the paste and alter the taste. Halfway through, turn the machine off and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula, then turn it back on and whizz the paste until it is completely pur\u00e9ed. Bring the stock or water to the boil with the salt. Add the curry paste, rinsing out the mortar or blender to make sure all the paste is used, and simmer for a minute before adding the whole shallots. Simmer for 3\u20134 minutes, then season with sugar, fish sauce and most of the tamarind water. Add the fish and the greens and simmer until everything is cooked. This thin curry should taste sour, salty and a little hot \u2013 adjust accordingly with fish sauce, tamarind water and chilli powder. Finish with the roasted chillies, if desired, and serve with steamed rice. STIR-FRIED MINCED BEEF WITH CHILLIES AND HOLY BASIL (NEUA PAT BAI GRAPAO)     Stir-fried minced beef. Photograph: Earl Carter    This is a relatively recent addition to the Thai repertoire, coming on to the streets about 50 years ago. The secret to the dish lies in the tempering of the wok, which imbues this simple stir-fry with a smoky tinge. Although beef was probably the first meat to be used, now minced chicken or pork, whole prawns or scored squid, even fish dumplings are cooked in this way. I find a rather coarse mince yields the best result \u2013 ideally done by hand, and using a cut of beef with some fat attached, such as flank, rump or shoulder. Strangely, for this dish I find that mincing or chopping the garlic and chillies gives a better flavour than pounding them. Add as many small chillies as you can bear \u2013 head towards 10, as this is meant to be hot. This dish and an egg or two over some steaming rice, with a bowl of chillies in fish sauce alongside, is Thai ambrosia. SERVES 2 garlic cloves 4 peeled bird&apos;s eye chillies (scuds) 4-10 good pinch of salt  vegetable oil 3-4 tbsp eggs 2 coarsely minced beef 200g fish sauce about 2 tbsp white sugar a large pinch stock or water 4 tbsp holy basil leaves 2 large handfuls Chillies in fish sauce: fish sauce 4 tbsp bird&apos;s eye chillies 10-15, finely sliced garlic cloves (optional but desirable) 2, finely sliced lime juice (optional) 1 tbsp chopped coriander a good pinch Coarsely chop the garlic with the chillies and salt. Heat a well-seasoned wok over a high heat then turn down the heat and add 2 tablespoons of the oil. Crack in one of the eggs and fry gently, shuffling the egg to prevent it from sticking, until it has cooked to your preference \u2013 I like mine with a runny yolk but with crispy, frazzled edges. Spoon some of the hot oil over the egg to ensure the yolk cooks evenly. Carefully lift out the egg with a spatula and place it on a warmed plate, then fry the other egg. Keep the eggs warm while you cook the beef. Add more oil \u2013 you&apos;ll need about 4 tablespoons in all in the wok. When the oil is hot, fry the garlic and chillies for a moment, but don&apos;t let them colour. Add the minced beef and continue to stir-fry for a minute until just cooked. Season to taste with the fish sauce and sugar but be careful not to make it too salty. Add the stock or water and simmer for a moment. Don&apos;t let it boil or stew for too long, otherwise the meat will toughen and too much liquid will evaporate \u2013 there should be enough to form a sauce. Stir in the holy basil and as soon as it is wilted remove from the heat. It should taste rich, hot, salty and spicy from the basil. To make the sauce, combine the fish sauce, chillies and garlic in a bowl and set aside. It keeps for some time \u2013 in fact it becomes richer and milder as it settles for a day. Make sure it is covered if you are making it in advance \u2013 and if the fish sauce evaporates, add an equivalent amount of water to refresh it. Just before serving, stir through the lime juice and coriander. Serve on two plates with plenty of steamed jasmine rice, a fried egg on top and a bowl of chillies in fish sauce on the side. DEEP-FRIED SOFT-SHELL CRABS WITH GARLIC AND BLACK PEPPER (BPUU NIM TORT PRIK THAI DAM)  In a few markets there are vendors who sell soft-shell crabs live \u2013 a rare treat \u2013 but they are more commonly available frozen. If neither can be found, fish, large prawns, squid or hard-shell crabs can be used in this recipe. In Thailand the garlic is less pungent and the cloves much smaller. It is used in abundance and with impunity. The skin is thinner and the flesh is young, soft and moist. Most Western garlic has a peppery sharpness to it, and its larger cloves have tougher skin, so you may need to fish out some of the excess hard shards. Look out for new-season garlic, which is much closer in taste to the Thai variety. Sauce Siracha is a wonderful chilli sauce, that&apos;s available in all Asian shops \u2013 it is a fairly standard accompaniment to dishes deep-fried with garlic and peppercorns. SERVES 2 soft-shell crabs 4, each about 60-75g, thawed if frozen coriander roots 6, cleaned and chopped salt garlic cloves, unpeeled 8-10, about 3 tbsp black peppercorns 1 tsp plain (all-purpose) flour 3-4 tbsp vegetable oil for deep-frying chopped coriander 1 tbsp sauce Siracha to serve To clean the crabs, lift the shell on each side of the body and scrape out the frond-like gills. Snip off the eyes and mouth. Give the crabs a quick rinse then pat dry with paper towel. Using a pestle and mortar, pound the coriander roots to a paste with a good pinch of salt. Add the garlic and continue to pound into a somewhat coarse paste. Remove excess or tough garlic skin then stir in the peppercorns, crushing them lightly. Mix the flour with a large pinch of salt. Dredge the cleaned crabs with the seasoned flour, shaking off any excess, then combine them with the garlic and black pepper paste. Pour the deep-frying oil into a large, stable wok or a wide, heavy-based pan until it is about two-thirds full. Heat the oil over a medium\u2013high flame until a cooking thermometer registers 180C/350F. Alternatively, test the temperature of the oil by dropping in a cube of bread \u2013 it will brown in about 15 seconds if the oil is hot enough. Deep-fry the crabs in the hot oil for 3\u20134 minutes, turning them a few times to ensure even cooking, until they are cooked and the garlic is golden. Should the garlic start to smell bitter and darken too much before the crabs are ready, quickly scoop it out. Lift out the crabs and drain on paper towel. Sprinkle with the chopped coriander and serve with steamed rice and a small bowl of sauce Siracha. GLASS NOODLES STIR-FRIED WITH MUSHROOMS AND FERMENTED BEAN CURD (WUN SEN PAT DTAO HUU YII) This is a wonderful vegetarian dish \u2013 a rarity on the streets of Bangkok. Fermented bean curd is a rich, nutty preparation of small cakes of bean curd cured in wine and spices that is sold in cans or jars at most Asian supermarkets. There are two varieties: one red and more pungent, the other creamy coloured and more mellow. I prefer the latter for its rich, toasty flavour and agreeable mustiness. As it is always quite salty, tread carefully with the level of saltiness in this dish. Jars of pickled garlic are also available in Asian shops. SERVES 4\u20135 dried glass (bean thread) noodles 300g coriander roots 1 tsp, cleaned and chopped   pinch of salt  ginger 1 slice garlic cloves 2 large, peeled vegetable oil 3 tbsp straw or oyster mushrooms 5, cleaned and cut into quarters small fresh shiitake mushrooms 4-6, stems removed fermented bean curd 2-3 tbsp pinch of white sugar  light soy sauce 2 tbsp light vegetable stock or water 250ml pickled garlic syrup 2 tbsp Chinese rice wine (optional, but a welcome addition) 1 tbsp Chinese cabbage 25g, chopped or baby spinach leaves 50g pickled garlic 2 tbsp, sliced long red chillies (optional) 1-2, sliced Asian celery 3 tbsp, cut into 2cm lengths spring (green) onions 2 tbsp, cut into 2cm lengths coriander leaves 2 tbsp ground white pepper a good pinch Place the noodles in a large bowl, cover with warm water and leave to soften for about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, using a pestle and mortar, pound the coriander roots, salt, ginger and garlic into a somewhat coarse paste. Drain the noodles and cut into roughly 10cm lengths.     Glass noodles stir-fried with mushrooms. Photograph: Earl Carter    Heat the oil in a wok, add the paste and fry until it begins to colour. Add the straw or oyster mushrooms and the shiitake mushrooms and stir-fry for a minute or so. Add the fermented bean curd and fry until it has slightly separated before adding the sugar, light soy sauce, stock or water, pickled garlic syrup and Chinese rice wine. Bring to the boil, add the cabbage, if using, then simmer for a minute before adding the noodles. However, if using baby spinach leaves, add them at the same time as the noodles. Simmer for another moment to ensure the noodles are cooked, but be careful not to overcook them or they will clump together and be disagreeably sticky. Stir in the pickled garlic, long red chillies is using, Asian celery and spring onions. Serve sprinkled with coriander leaves and white pepper. CRUNCHY PRAWN CAKES (GUNG FOI TORT) Small prawns are best for this dish as there is no need to peel them. For the unconvinced, peeled prawns will do \u2013 although the cakes will be less crunchy. Try to find small prawns or, failing that, chop them. MAKES 4-5 CAKES vegetable oil for deep-frying small raw prawns (shrimp) about 600g, rinsed and drained, whiskers trimmed or raw prawns (shrimp) 1kg, peeled and chopped chopped coriander 1 tbsp For the batter:  lime paste very small pinch rice flour 150g coconut cream 4 tbsp salt 1 tsp For the batter, dissolve the lime paste in 7 tablespoons water and wait for about 15 minutes until it has completely precipitated. Drain off and reserve the lime water, discarding the sludgy residue. Knead the flour with 4 tablespoons of water to form quite a firm dough. Rest for 30 minutes, then combine the coconut cream, 4 tablespoons of the lime water and the salt and work into the dough. It should have a thick, pancake-like consistency. If the batter is left to stand for some time, dilute it with a little lime water or coconut cream as the flour swells.     Crunchy prawn cakes Photograph: Earl Carter    Pour the deep-frying oil into a large, stable wok or a wide, heavy-based pan until it is about two-thirds full. Heat the oil over a medium to high flame until a cooking thermometer registers 180C (350F). Alternatively, test the temperature of the oil by dropping in a cube of bread \u2013 it will brown in about 15 seconds if the oil is hot enough. Check the texture and seasoning of the batter by dropping a spoonful of it into the oil. Deep-fry for a moment and then lift out with a spider. Drain and cool slightly, then taste: it shouldn&apos;t be too dry or firm and it must be pleasingly salty. Adjust the batter with more lime water or salt, as necessary. Mix half the prawns with about half the batter. Using a large spoon, carefully drop spoonfuls of the batter into the hot oil: this amount of batter should make 2 or 3 cakes. Deep-fry the prawn cakes until golden, turning two or three times to ensure even cooking and colour. Lift out with a spider and drain on paper towel. Repeat with the remaining prawns and batter. Sprinkle with the chopped coriander and serve with a bowl of sweet chilli and peanut sauce. To make the sauce, you will need: 1-3 long red chillies, deseeded and chopped; a good pinch of salt; \u00bd\u20131 garlic clove, peeled; 125ml white vinegar; 100g white sugar; and 2 tablespoons roasted and ground peanuts. Use a pestle and mortar to pound the chillies with the salt, then add the garlic and pound to a smooth paste. Scrape the paste into a small pan, with the vinegar and sugar, and simmer until thick. Allow to cool before stirring in the ground peanuts.

Playwright Mark Ravenhill, author of Shopping and Fucking and Mother Clap&apos;s Molly House, will be associate director. Operas staged in an unvarnished and intimate way will attempt to reach out to audiences who would never normally consider this kind of entertainment. The Little Opera House at the former King&apos;s Head will also avoid the high prices and expensive overheads that Miller says he believes are &quot;immoral&quot; in these straitened economic times. &quot;We are living in a completely unfair society,&quot; said the renowned 76-year-old director this weekend. &quot;Many people are very underprivileged in this country, while there are these huge ornamental opera productions being staged. There is something immoral about it.&quot; Miller, whose revived modern-dress production of Mozart&apos;s Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte is winning critical acclaim at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden this month, wants to find a way to shed the orthodox trappings of the opera house. &quot;There is a strange sort of intimacy if you can get away from the luxurious establishments we have, where people just relish being there because they are rich. There is something about the gigantic, gilded theatres that we associate with opera that is wrong,&quot; said Miller, who plans to direct at the new venue in the next season. The King&apos;s Head in north London established itself as a beacon for experimental work when it was opened in 1970 by maverick American fringe impresario Dan Crawford, in the back room of an Islington pub. Crawford&apos;s widow, Stephanie Sinclaire, has now passed on the artistic directorship of the venue to Adam Spreadbury-Maher, the Australian director and producer who staged an award-winning, sell-out production of La Boh\u00e8me in a pub in Kilburn last year. He now plans to stage a succession of new works, alongside work from the operatic canon. &quot;In doing operas on a very intimate scale, in front of an audience of a hundred at the most, you renovate them,&quot; said Miller, who hopes to stage a new production of Berg&apos;s Lulu at the pub venue. &quot;In this time of great cuts, I have real misgivings about throwing pearls before pearls,&quot; he explained. &quot;I like it when you can put opera into a setting where it is not all about people luxuriating in displays of their wealth.&quot; Miller added that he believes that dressing up for the opera is &quot;totally absurd&quot; and that many potential opera-goers are put off by the expense. Although his Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte has been screened live in cinemas, tickets to see it at Covent Garden can cost up to \u00a3200. With top-price tickets at only \u00a315, the new opera at the King&apos;s Head will try to break down the social barriers around the art form and put the telling of good stories on top of the creative agenda. Spreadbury-Maher, 28, trained as a singer in Australia but soon switched to directing, putting on Puccini&apos;s La Boh\u00e8me at the Cock Tavern in Kilburn. This small production is now officially the longest-running opera in the world and has just transferred to London&apos;s Soho Theatre. Miller offered his support when he came to see La Boh\u00e8me and found that its new artistic director shared many of his views. &quot;Opera has died and we need to perform CPR on it,&quot; said Spreadbury-Maher. &quot;There is a massive everyman audience out there and we have got to take it to them.&quot; Like Miller, the Australian had been struck by the restrictive formality and distance between opera audiences and the stage. &quot;At worst, it can be almost like going to a wedding, with everyone sitting still. It is a charade. Audiences need a kick in the guts, or at least a thump on the heart. Otherwise they should just stay at home and listen to a CD.&quot; Spreadbury-Maher said he wants to make opera work on a smaller scale, not only because it can be a better theatrical experience, but because it gives young, talented performers the chance to sing roles they would not usually have the chance to play until much later in their career, if ever. &quot;In London it has got to be in one of two opera houses, really, and then by the time you get to the right stage in the career you also have to know the right people,&quot; said Spreadbury-Maher. &quot;You have to have become one of those few singers who have worked away at gaining that position.&quot; The new season at the Little Opera House, which starts on 6 October with a production of The Barber of Seville set in\u00a0Salisbury and directed by Robin Norton-Hale, will be followed with a version of Puccini&apos;s Madame Butterfly set in Bangkok, with Butterfly as a Ladyboy and her lover, Pinkerton, an American Airlines pilot. Ravenhill will write and direct two new operas for the King&apos;s Head in 2011. Miller also revealed that he will be bringing his acclaimed European production of Bach&apos;s St Matthew Passion to the stage of the Olivier at the National Theatre for its British premiere.", "publicationDate": "2010-09-18T23:06:11Z", "tags": ["Opera", "Music", "Theatre", "Stage", "UK news", "Jonathan Miller"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/sep/19/opera-london-pub-kings-head", "title": "Opera in a London pub aims to end elitism and high prices", "sentences": ["&quot;You have to have become one of those few singers who have worked away at gaining that position.&quot; The new season at the Little Opera House, which starts on 6 October with a production of The Barber of Seville set in\u00a0Salisbury and directed by Robin Norton-Hale, will be followed with a version of Puccini&apos;s Madame Butterfly set in Bangkok, with Butterfly as a Ladyboy and her lover, Pinkerton, an American Airlines pilot."]}, {"article": "Imagine a newspaper decided to create a table ranking the world&apos;s cities. Is Moscow better than Sydney? Would Hong Kong squeeze in above Manchester? Or Bangkok above Brighton? It would be a nonsensical exercise. Better in what respect? They are all vastly different types of human settlement, meeting different aspects of human need in different cultures and climates. True, there would be no shortage of data, though it would be of variable robustness and gathered on different bases in different countries. We could compare expenditure on public transport, or the area of open space, or unemployment. But to come to a single ranking, we would then have to manipulate the data: should a measure of the state of public health outweigh a measure of investment in public transport? Exactly the same problems arise with world rankings of universities. Each time a new set is published, universities shoot up or down the league tables, and vice-chancellors the world over engage in their traditional exercise of deploy (if up) or deplore (otherwise). But, in the real world, nothing has changed. The relative strengths of UK universities vis-a-vis their international peers vary only marginally and incrementally year on year. All that has changed is that the league table compilers have adopted new metrics and applied new weightings to them, but they still fall miles short of capturing anything like the variety, the dynamism and the diversity of the modern university. The basic problem is that there is no definition of the ideal university. Is it big or small? Is it better at research or at teaching? Is it a specialist science and technology institution with heavy research income \u2013 or does it focus primarily on the humanities and social sciences? Is it adventurous or risk averse? Next, what are the data? On teaching, there are simply no robust data on which global comparison can be made. Some tables rely on curious proxies, such as the number of PhDs awarded per academic, the number of undergraduates admitted per academic and the income per academic. None of these say anything about the quality of teaching. We might expect measures of research excellence to be robust, because top research is a globalised activity. Yet we would be disappointed. Take research income. There is a world of difference between scientific and medical institutions \u2013 where research is expensive and grants tend to be large \u2013 and other types of institution. This helps to explain why a world-class institution such as the London School of Economics can be ranked in one table no higher than 86th. What&apos;s more, research income is an input measure, and will tend to be higher in countries investing seriously in research. It does not speak to the quality of output, where UK universities have consistently demonstrated outstanding return on investment. Research citations can be a measure of quality, but need to be intelligently applied. There are big cultural variations between disciplines, and citation indices are not well attuned to capturing research excellence in the humanities, arts and social sciences. This isn&apos;t easy territory. Get it wrong and you end up with some truly bizarre results. For example, one of the recent sets of rankings concludes that Egypt&apos;s Alexandria University trumps both Stanford and Harvard for their influential research measured by impact. Global rankings have afforded annual light entertainment, but they are now seriously overreaching themselves. They do a disservice if they influence student choice, or come to be treated as a performance measure by the leaders of hugely diverse institutions. \u2022 Malcolm Grant is president and provost of UCL, which in current world rankings is variously placed at 4 (QS), 13 (Global Universities Ranking), 17 (Taiwan index), 21 (Shanghai Jiao Tong), 22 (THE) or 81 (4iCU)", "publicationDate": "2010-09-21T06:00:38Z", "tags": ["Higher education", "Research", "Research funding", "Education"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/sep/21/university-world-rankings", "title": "University world rankings are pointless, UCL president says", "sentences": ["Or Bangkok above Brighton?"]}, {"article": "I am looking at the feasibility of a few days in Bangkok before going to Australia for the first two Ashes Test matches in Brisbane (25-29 November) and Adelaide (3-7 December) on a budget basis. The cost of official Ashes tours is very high. What do you think is best way to do this please? I do not mind staying in budget accommodation.  Bob Stather According to Austravel (0800 988 4834, austravel.com), there are flights to Brisbane starting at around \u00a31,095 with Qantas which allow for an optional stopover in Bangkok on selected dates in November.  I found a fare of around \u00a31,750 return including taxes with either BA or Qantas, with an internal flight between Brisbane and Adelaide. I based this on flying out on November 20, having two days in Bangkok then six nights in each of Brisbane and Adelaide, returning home on 9 December. An alternative option would be to fly with another airline, and instead use either Hong Kong, Singapore or Kuala Lumpur as a hub. Ben Briggs, brand manager at Austravel, says the company has been inundated with calls from both customers and agents looking for flights and accommodation. &quot;Having said that,&quot; he added, &quot;there is still availability for both flights and accommodation. Around the match dates, however, it is the internal flights that are a slight problem as these are at a premium. Travellers will therefore need to be flexible with internal travel, so they should think about alternative ways to travel between destinations. Instead of flying they could perhaps hire a car or a motorhome to get around. Another option is a rail journey.&quot; Once in the host city, beds in hostel dorms are an excellent option, with plenty of choice, low rates and a sociable atmosphere. Adelaide Central YHA is already showing no availability for male dorms while the Test is taking place, but a Hostelworld.com search reveals plenty of space in other places, with prices starting at \u00a317 a night. The huge Brisbane City YHA has vacancies for the duration of the Test starting at \u00a322 per night. If you really want to keep costs down, you can stay with local people using couchsurfing.com or airbnb.com. Tickets for some days at the Tests are sold out \u2013 but check availability and you can buy tickets at ticketmaster.com.au. Or check out getmein.com. I am free for five to six days at the end of October and am very keen to explore the Scottish Highlands, probably flying to and from Glasgow and hiring a car. Do you have a suggested itinerary? We&apos;d like to do a couple of walks, maybe see some spectacular beaches. I&apos;ve read the Lonely Planet Scotland guide and simply can&apos;t whittle down the suggested 14-day itineraries. I&apos;ve also heard that it may be shooting season and that could cause a bit of trouble when walking! Simon Ryan, London I&apos;m including this question partly because it sounds terrific and partly because I&apos;m sure readers will have plenty of suggestions. Five to six days will become four unless you&apos;re careful \u2013 distances aren&apos;t huge but getting anywhere in the north-west of Scotland takes a while, especially as you&apos;ll want to stop and gawk at the scenery and stretch your legs. One possibility would be to arrange a one-way rental from Glasgow to Inverness, which would allow you to spend longer in wilder places. With this amount of time I&apos;d head straight for Fort William, bypassing the Trossachs, which offers several days of great walking and exploring points north and west. Along the way you&apos;ll pass by Loch Lomond, cross Rannoch Moor and traverse Glencoe. This might be Britain&apos;s most dramatic drive, but you&apos;re only getting started. The obvious walk in the area is up Ben Nevis, but this is a long hike and not a gentle day out. A different option would be starting from Kinlochleven rather than Fort William and heading up the grassy slopes of the Mamores and following the ridge where, if you&apos;re very lucky, you may spot eagles. There&apos;s a suggested walk in this area at Binnein Mor and Na Gruagaichean. Continue north to the lovely village of Plockton and on to Glen Torridon for more great walking, then on to Ullapool from where you can attempt as much of dramatic, brooding An Teallach as your legs and the weather can handle. There&apos;s probably too much even here, but as you&apos;re in such a beautiful part of the country the temptation is to do more, not less. Just this once I&apos;d give in to that instinct and push yourself a little. It&apos;s rare to have your planned walk disturbed or postponed by shooting parties, especially if you&apos;re sticking to well-known routes, but check at local tourist information centres before setting out. Wearing something bright is always a good idea. I am planning to travel to Cairo via Marrakech for one week in November, and want to know if there are any cheap-ish routes? Lindsay, by email Land travel across north Africa is complicated by closed borders between Morocco and Algeria and the impossibility of overland travel through Libya, so it&apos;s by plane or nothing, I&apos;m afraid. Even if you could make it overland, it would take much longer than a week. There&apos;s neither the business or tourist traffic to merit a direct route between the two cities, so you&apos;re looking at going via either Casablanca in Morocco, or changing planes in a European hub. The best fare I could find in November was \u00a3183 with Royal Air Maroc and Egyptair, changing in Casablanca. Unless you&apos;re booking this as part of a complete package travelling to or from the UK, you are best off making this arrangement with a travel agency when you get to Marrakech. Local agents will have access to the best fares and may even be able to beat this deal. I&apos;ve just had a great time in Cuba and am now planning my next trip. I was hoping to go around June, and I&apos;ve looked at Costa Rica which appeals greatly: it&apos;s exotic, the hotels look amazing, and it&apos;s more than a beach holiday which means we can venture into the rainforests. But I was wondering would it be the best time to go weather-wise? I&apos;m worried if it was the rainy season, the holiday would be a complete wash-out. And are there any other countries that aren&apos;t the typical places everyone goes to with nice beaches and stuff to do? Paul Hibbitt, by email Your assessment of Costa Rica is pretty much spot-on. It offers beaches, wildlife and nature, often within close proximity to each other. It will feel very different to Cuba, having had several decades of visitors from North America. One thing to consider: Costa Rica isn&apos;t an exactly cheap place, especially in comparison with neighbouring countries. A reasonable mid-range daily budget would be \u00a330 to \u00a350, though you could get by on less if you were prepared to stay and eat at bottom-bracket \u2013 though still reasonable \u2013 places. You will, as you&apos;ll note from these prices, find it cheaper than visiting Europe, America or most places in the Caribbean, though. June is the early part of the rainy season in Costa Rica, so you can expect things to be stickier and wetter than usual. In reality, it rains year-round pretty much everywhere, so while it&apos;s wetter at this time, you&apos;ll benefit from cheaper rates and fewer crowds around popular spots such as Volcan Arenal and the surf beaches of the Pacific coast. Watch out for travelling later in June and July as prices can rise with summer holiday traffic. As alternatives, you might consider Nicaragua and Panama, which, while less developed, may offer a more exotic and less expensive trip. But this needs to be balanced with the ease of getting around Costa Rica. Or take a longer trip and see all three.", "publicationDate": "2010-09-22T12:45:09Z", "tags": ["Australia holidays", "Morocco holidays", "Egypt holidays", "Costa Rica holidays", "Scotland holidays", "Travel"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2010/sep/22/ask-tom-advice-ashes-australia", "title": "Ask Tom - your travel dilemmas answered", "sentences": ["I am looking at the feasibility of a few days in Bangkok before going to Australia for the first two Ashes Test matches in Brisbane (25-29 November) and Adelaide (3-7 December) on a budget basis.", "Bob Stather According to Austravel (0800 988 4834, austravel.com), there are flights to Brisbane starting at around \u00a31,095 with Qantas which allow for an optional stopover in Bangkok on selected dates in November.", "I based this on flying out on November 20, having two days in Bangkok then six nights in each of Brisbane and Adelaide, returning home on 9 December."]}, {"article": "Green curry has not aged well on these damp and chilly shores. Like many of us, it&apos;s thickened a bit over the years, and lost its edge. No longer the zingy arriviste which first startled our jalfrezi-jaded taste buds with its arresting combination of sour, sweet, salt and heat, with typical British aplomb, we&apos;ve Anglicised it into creamy, sugary comfort food. The best way to get reacquainted with the real thing is by giving the ready meals and the takeaways a miss, and getting back to basics in the kitchen.  The backbone of a green curry paste is, of course, the chillies which give it its colour \u2013 although, truth be told, most authentic pastes are more of a murky beige. As well as heat, you need something salty \u2013 shrimp paste, or fish sauce \u2013 and some aromatics, like lemongrass and galangal, as well as the shallots and garlic which give the curry pungency and depth. The other ingredients are, as we will see, up for debate.Before you reach for the jasmine rice, however, a word of caution. A green curry is easy to make \u2013 a green curry paste is not. Or, at least, not in Britain, particularly if you don&apos;t live anywhere near an oriental grocers. Take it from Kasma Loha-unchit, Thai cookery teacher and author of the award-winning It Rains Fishes; &quot;unless you have all of the fresh herbs and spices required to make authentic and traditional Thai curry pastes, you&apos;re better off using commercial curry pastes than trying to make do with ill-advised substitutes&quot;. This isn&apos;t necessarily a disaster however \u2013 there are some very good pastes out there, and it&apos;s what you do with them that counts. The usual suspect     Nigel Slater recipe green curry paste. Photograph: Felicity Cloake    It was Nigel Slater who first turned me on to the idea of making my own curry paste. His thrillingly tangy, peppery recipe has impressed many guests over the years \u2013 what I didn&apos;t admit is that it&apos;s surprisingly easy to make. Lemongrass, chillies, garlic, galangal, shallots, coriander, lime leaves, lime juice, fish sauce and black peppercorns are whizzed into a &quot;vivid, spicily fragrant slush&quot; before being cooked with coconut milk, stock, green peppercorns and whatever protein you might fancy, and topped with a handful of coriander and Thai basil leaves. As usual, it&apos;s delicious \u2013 sour, spicy, and very definitely not comfort food.  Sweet and sour     Rick Stein recipe green curry paste. Photograph: Felicity Cloake    My first brush with Thai food, however, came when Nigel was still a new boy at the Observer, and certainly outside my teenage ken, in the form of Keith Floyd, sweaty and magnificently manic, prancing around South East Asia with an unreliable gas stove. I&apos;m disappointed to discover that he advocates using a paste in the accompanying book, until I consider the probable availability of galangal back in 1994.  Rick Stein&apos;s recent travels in the footsteps of Floyd seemed a good place to look for a substitute; although somewhat grandiosely named, Far Eastern Odyssey was an excellent series, and I&apos;m keen to try out the recipe (pdf) he picked up at the Poj Spa Kar restaurant in Bangkok. As well as the chillies (a scant number, in my opinion \u2013 just 2, to Slater&apos;s 6), galangal, lemongrass, shallots and garlic, he calls for 3 makrut (aka kaffir) lime leaves, and a teaspoon of shrimp paste. Both ingredients should be available in big supermarkets; although you can&apos;t import makrut lime leaves fresh into this country, Waitrose sells them frozen as part of their Cooks Ingredients range, and they&apos;re also found in jars.      Rick Stein recipe Thai green curry. Photograph: Felicity Cloake    The intensely savoury shrimp paste is complemented by the fish sauce which Stein adds to the curry itself, along with coconut milk, lime juice and 2 tsp palm sugar. I like the sweet and sour quality this gives the finished dish, but feel it overpowers the flavours of the carefully made paste \u2013 despite the lime leaves and the lemongrass, it just doesn&apos;t taste as fresh as Nigel&apos;s. The quest for the makrut lime If ever a book made claims for itself, it&apos;s Madhur Jaffrey&apos;s Ultimate Curry Bible. Surely here would be a recipe to beat Mr Slater&apos;s \u2013 given to the redoubtable Madhur by the Oriental Hotel Bangkok, it certainly has more claim to &apos;authenticity&apos;. I&apos;m pleased by the number of chillies \u2013 a whopping 14 bird&apos;s eyes \u2013 but not by the sudden appearance of makrut lime rind, which takes me three days to track down.  Makrut limes are knobbly, warty little things much prized for their unlikely perfume, but sadly, thanks to the aforementioned import restrictions, they&apos;re impossible to buy fresh in this country (although I notice small trees are available for \u00a325 online). After an exhausting tour of Chinatown&apos;s oriental supermarkets, and a trip out to a Thai specialist in Hammersmith, who look at me as if I&apos;m slightly crazed, and recommend I purchase a paste instead, I finally discover some pickled peel online. Hallelujah!      Madhur Jaffrey recipe Thai green curry.  Photograph: Felicity Cloake    The recipe also calls for 6-8 fresh coriander roots, which have a deeper, more intense flavour than the leaves. Indian and oriental grocers may sell them with the roots still attached, but if not, for every root called for, pound 10 bare coriander stems into a paste and then use in the same way. The paste itself is promising \u2013 a lovely vibrant green, thanks to all those chillies \u2013 but once I&apos;ve added the required teaspoon of thick, dark tamarind paste to the pan, 1 tsp of palm sugar and 1\u00bd tbsp fish sauce, it&apos;s sort of muddy looking, and much too sour. In fact, despite the lime zest and the lemongrass, it&apos;s hardly aromatic at all.  Fresh flavours Thankfully, this is the only recipe I see that uses tamarind. It&apos;s also the last one to call for a reasonable number of chillies. The Blue Elephant chain of restaurants, serving &quot;royal Thai cuisine&quot; demands 24, and 2 tsp of roasted and ground coriander seeds. The results are spicy, but again, lack the in-your-face aromatic qualities I was hoping for. I find the recipe from Rosemary Brissenden&apos;s encyclopaedic South East Asian Food, with its comparatively modest 20 chillies, more pleasing, because it contains no dried spices whatsoever, other than \u00bd tsp of ground peppercorns. This seems to gives the finished paste a fresh, startlingly hot flavour which sets it apart from the others.  Two tips Brissenden also teaches me to allow the curry paste to cook in the oil from the coconut milk, rather than frying it first, as in many other South East Asian cuisines. According to Thai food blogger SheSimmers, curry sauces are supposed to separate \u2013 not only does it make them look more appetising to Thai eyes, but it indicates the paste has been correctly cooked.  She also makes a convincing case for making the curry paste in a pestle and mortar, rather than a food processor; &quot;an electric blade will always chop rather than pound, no matter how finely it does so. Even though you may end up with very small particles in your paste, the flavours will remain &apos;chopped&apos; and separate rather than merged. Pounding spices into each other one by one in a stone mortar and pestle does a more complete job of extracting all their oils and causes the old spice to absorb the tastes of the new, until the flavours are completely melded.&quot; I&apos;m pleased I only read this after making her paste \u2013 but fortunately I&apos;m given the chance to try it out in my final recipe. Thai guru     David Thompson's recipe green curry paste. Photograph: Felicity Cloake    For serious devotees of Thai cookery, there&apos;s really only one recipe worth bothering with. David Thompson, the first Thai chef to win a Michelin star for his London restaurant Nahm, is also the author of the only Thai work to merit a place in Observer Food Monthly&apos;s top 50 cookbooks, Thai Food. He is, quite simply, a guru for those of us struggling to tell our galangal from our gapi \u2013 and he advocates using a pestle and mortar. The paste does seem much more homogenous, with fewer little bits and I&apos;m grudgingly won over \u2013 once I&apos;ve worked out the hard way that it&apos;s advisable to wear eye protection while crushing chillies by hand. By this point, I thought I&apos;d seen it all when it came to Thai ingredients, but no as well as all the usual suspects, he throws in a new one; red turmeric. This is the fresh root we more often see in powdered form; from experience, I can assure you, it&apos;s equally staining \u2013 my fingers look like those of a committed smoker for some days after cooking his recipe, but my word is it worth it. Strong, salty, spicy, rich and aromatic, Thompson&apos;s curry is as overwhelming and thrilling as a Bangkok street market. I omit the optional roasted coriander seeds, as I feel they interfere with the fresh flavour of the dish, and to make it absolutely perfect, I add half a teaspoon of palm sugar as a counterpoint to the savoury notes of the shrimp paste, which rounds things out nicely. The best green curry pastes take no prisoners. They should be made by hand, with more chilli, lemongrass and shrimp paste than you think strictly wise, and cooked carefully \u2013 then you&apos;ll remember why you fell in love with Thai food in the first place.

His first mistake cost him the third frame to a 69 break but, with 47 and 25 in penalties from a shrewd snooker in the fourth, he clinched his place in his 33rd ranking final, 22 of which have yielded him a title. Neil Robertson, the world champion, came from 2-0 down with breaks of 68, 101 and 80 to beat Mark Williams, twice world champion, 3-2 and will wake up tomorrow as the new world No1, a rolling system having been adopted in place of a single revision at the end of each season.

This weekend &quot;it&apos;s our turn&quot;, their statement added. The Underworld author has been named winner of the $25,000 (\u00a316,000) prize, which goes to an American fiction writer whose work &quot;possesses qualities of excellence, ambition, and scale of achievement over a sustained career which place him or her in the highest rank of American literature&quot;. Roth, a previous winner, and his fellow judges Nathan Englander and Joan Acocella said it was &quot;fitting&quot; that an award honouring Bellow should go to DeLillo, as &quot;both men were historical novelists who, in their most ambitious works, dealt with American life in the mid to late 20th century, after World War II, and with the dark knowledge we acquired therein&quot;. &quot;In DeLillo, though, because of his later place in time \u2013 he was born in 1936 \u2013 the knowledge is graver, and crazier,&quot; the judges said. Author of 15 novels and four plays, DeLillo told PEN that it was a &quot;special honour&quot; to be given a prize bearing Bellow&apos;s name. &quot;I still have my old paperback copy of Herzog, a novel I recall reading with great pleasure,&quot; said the author, answering questions by fax. &quot;It wasn&apos;t the first Bellow novel I encountered \u2013 that was The Victim, whose opening sentence (&apos;On some nights New York is as hot as Bangkok&apos;) seemed a novel in itself, at least to a New Yorker. Bellow was a strong force in our literature, making leaps from one book to the next. He was one of the writers who expanded my sense of the American novel&apos;s range, or, maybe a better word for Bellow - its clutch, its grasp.&quot; DeLillo has always had &quot;special admiration&quot; for American fiction which &quot;attempts to be equal to the sweep of American experience&quot;, he said. &quot;Sinclair Lewis called for &apos;a literature worthy of our vastness&apos;. A novelist tends to feel this spread and breadth in his fingertips (or not) and I&apos;ve tried to bring a sense of our strange and dangerous times into my work.&quot; Asked how technology is changing fiction, the author speculated that novels would become &quot;user-generated&quot;, and wondered if the &quot;human need for narrative&quot; would be reduced. &quot;The world is becoming increasingly customised, altered to individual specifications. This shrinking context will necessarily change the language that people speak, write, and read,&quot; he said. &quot;Here&apos;s a stray question (or a metaphysical leap): Will language have the same depth and richness in electronic form that it can reach on the printed page? Does the beauty and variability of our language depend to an important degree on the medium that carries the words? Does poetry need paper?&quot; An active member of PEN, protesting recently against the imprisonment of Chinese writer Liu Xiaobo, DeLillo said that &quot;writers who are subjected to state censorship, threatened with imprisonment or menaced by violent forces in their society clearly merit the support of those of us who enjoy freedom of expression&quot;. &quot;There are things a writer never takes for granted, like the long life he will need to live in order to write the long novel he is trying to write,&quot; said the author. &quot;Maybe freedom to write belongs at the top of the list, on behalf of those writers who face the grim reality of being enemies of the state.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-09-27T11:26:41Z", "tags": ["Don DeLillo", "Books", "PEN literary prizes", "Fiction", "Awards and prizes", "Culture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/27/don-delillo-pen-saul-bellow-award", "title": "Don DeLillo wins PEN/Saul Bellow award", "sentences": ["&quot;It wasn&apos;t the first Bellow novel I encountered \u2013 that was The Victim, whose opening sentence (&apos;On some nights New York is as hot as Bangkok&apos;) seemed a novel in itself, at least to a New Yorker."]}, {"article": "Salted caramel ice-cream by Tim Hayward  My daughter Liberty surprised everyone on holiday this year by straying from her unerring choice of dull vanilla ice-cream into the exotic and adventurous culinary peak of caramel beurre sal\u00e9. She managed to wolf down at least a coupe a day. Combining the best of dulce de leche and American saltwater taffy, it&apos;s a flavour we don&apos;t encounter much in the UK but it&apos;s hugely popular all over France. On the face of it, it shouldn&apos;t be tough to replicate. I&apos;ve made ice-cream many times with the irritating keep-the-bowl-in-the-freezer machine I picked up at a car boot sale years ago. And I&apos;ve got Henry Harris on speed-dial \u2013 he runs Racine in Knightsbridge, London, and is widely regarded as the finest French chef with the decency to be British. The caramel part is a breeze. The sugar melts quickly in a pan and then, just as it starts to achieve a bronzed loveliness and the great smells are really flying, I beat in 60g of salted butter . . . I assume that&apos;s what they mean by beurre sal\u00e9 but I need to check. A quick call to Henry reveals that I should probably add more salt \u2013 fleur de sel for preference \u2013 and perhaps even a little sprinkled on the top at serving for added crunch and flavour. By the time I&apos;m off the phone the caramel is roughly the texture of dried carpet glue but I whip in half a litre of heated full-fat milk and 250ml of double cream. When it&apos;s smooth and free of lumps, in go five egg yolks. Once it&apos;s cooled I pour the mixture into the machine while Liberty watches like a starved raptor. It does its work with the painful inefficiency of an appliance so unloved that it&apos;s probably been in 18 jumble sales since it was first bought in 1970. Hopefully her impatience will temper her judgment. So far, Liberty has rejected my bolognese as inferior to the local Italian and my home-baked bread as &quot;too brown&quot;. I don&apos;t hold out much hope for the ice-cream. Is it as good as the stuff we had this summer? &quot;Not really Dad. But nice try.&quot; Actually, I thought I&apos;d done a pretty fine job. It might not have reminded Liberty of her holidays but it made me nostalgic for ice-creams eaten at the spiritual home of caramel beurre sal\u00e9, Glacier Berthillon in the sanctifying shadow of Notre Dame, Paris. But that was a long seven years ago, when her mother and I were still blissfully free of responsibility and I didn&apos;t feel the need to cook complicated desserts for wretched and ungrateful children. \u2022 Tim&apos;s recipe Linguine with clams by Sybil Kapoor As my memories of walking through ancient olive groves high up on the Ligurian cliffs of Italy begin to fade, I decide to try to recapture the sparkling blue sea and dappled walks by cooking linguine alle vongole for supper. Somehow this simple combination of garlic, clams, olive oil and white wine encapsulates the Ligurian landscape. It&apos;ll be easy, I think. Just cook some clams with a little garlic, olive oil and wine, then remove and strain their liquor. Fry a little more garlic with some fresh chilli, toss in my cooked linguine, clams and strained juice, and finish with parsley. Is it me, the autumn nights, or the telly in the background? It just doesn&apos;t taste the same. &quot;It&apos;s partly the oil,&quot; explains Enzo Cassini, Ligurian-born general manager of Michelin-starred Zafferano in London. &quot;Ligurian olive oil is made either from small, sweet Taggiasca olives or Arnasca and Colombina olives. We use a Taggiasca olive oil here.&quot; (Vittorio Cassini, available from Selfridges.) The olives are grown at a high altitude and produce a fragrant, almondy oil, quite unlike a peppery Tuscan one. Executive chef Andy Needham shows me the ingredients they use: slow-growing British carpet (palourde) clams which are much sweeter than their Ligurian counterparts, Ligurian olive oil and Voiello dried linguine. The latter is Trafilate al Bronzo linguine n.111, which cooks within five and half minutes. It is cut with a bronze die, which gives the linguine a slightly rough texture that ensures it absorbs more flavour. Exquisite smells are released as he stirs half a head of garlic, a strip of finely pared orange zest, fresh thyme and some sliced red chilli into the sizzling clams, before adding a splash of white wine. I feel as though I&apos;m back in the Italian Riviera. While the clams are shelled and their liquid strained, I suddenly understand why my dish hadn&apos;t lived up to my memories \u2013 a ladle of sea bass stock is added. The linguine, already half-cooked in water, absorbs the broth before being finished off to a buttery consistency with olive oil, a dash of clam broth and a hint of home-made chilli oil. Finally the clams are heated through, parsley added and the dish served. Back at home, I replicate the recipe as best I can and, much to my surprise, it really does taste of sea, olive groves and thyme. \u2022 Sybil&apos;s recipe Larb by Alex Renton Moving to Edinburgh after four years in Thailand was a shock. My family and I had got accustomed to the luxury of living in a nation where people eat \u2013 with amazing invention \u2013 every three hours. On our busy street you could do a tour of south-east Asian street food in 100m of roadside stalls \u2013 Chinese-Thai oyster omelettes and gway tiaow noodle broth, barbecued offal and baby squid on sticks, deep-fried crickets and sugared, sesamed dried pork. We developed serious addictions to chilli. In Scotland we have gone cold turkey. Thai restaurants here \u2013 with a couple of exceptions \u2013 are a sham, serving imitation Thai food: som tam salad with shredded cabbage standing in for green papaya; &quot;green&quot; and &quot;red&quot; curries out of a bottle; gruesome, soggy pad thai. All these frauds are so gently chillied you might have fed them to a baby. Thankfully, before I left I got a friend to teach me one dish I thought I could not live without. Larb is the classic meat, chilli, lime, onion and herb salad of Laos and the northern Thai provinces, usually eaten with sticky rice. Where my Thai teacher used two types of basil, three of coriander and two different mints, I&apos;m down to the three basic herbs that the Leith Walk greengrocer can provide. But she would approve of the Scottish meat \u2013 Bangkok markets were cursed by bad quality factory chicken and pork. I massage oyster sauce into the beef and bake it briefly in a sealed foil packet. The hot juices go straight into the dressing, one of the key potions of Thai cuisine, with its cornerstones of lime juice, sugar, chilli and fish sauce. Then I slice the meat carpaccio thin \u2013 minced meat is more usual in a larb, but I do it my teacher&apos;s way. The final touch, just before serving, is khao kua \u2013 powdered, roasted glutinous rice I have found online (Raanthai.co.uk sells the Longdan brand). It coats the meat, giving the dish its crucial nutty, mealy texture. On the table, the larb is beautiful and ballsy: green, purple and fragrant. It should be as chillied as you can stand \u2013 they say that when it makes your ears ache, it&apos;s hot enough. Through the tears in our eyes, my wife and I pretend we&apos;re back grazing the food stalls on the street of a thousand smells. \u2022 Alex&apos;s recipe", "publicationDate": "2010-09-30T05:59:00Z", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Life and style", "Travel", "Food and drink"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/sep/30/recreating-favourite-holiday-meals", "title": "Cooking up holiday memories", "sentences": ["But she would approve of the Scottish meat \u2013 Bangkok markets were cursed by bad quality factory chicken and pork."]}, {"article": "     The re-emergence of slavery on ships off West Africa is profoundly shocking but it is not a surprise. Last week slavery its modern form came to light in cases of forced labour uncovered on trawlers fishing for the European market. In a haunting echo of the 18th century triangular trade, west African workers were found off the coast of Sierra Leone on board boats where they lived and worked in ships&apos; holds with less than a metre of head height, sometimes for 18 hours a day for no pay, packed like sardines to sleep in spaces too small to stand up, with their documents taken from them and no means of escape. It is no accident that globalisation has seen the reemergence of slavery. The human degradation off West Africa is replicated elsewhere. I first came across modern slavery when investigating the UK chicken supply chain in Thailand in 2002. UK retailers and manufacturers now source much of their cheap commodity chicken from Asian factories. On the subcontracted farms around Bangkok that supply the international poultry processing factories I found illegal Burmese migrants trapped in debt bondage and forced labour. Fifteen Burmese refugees, interviewed for me by the American Centre for International Labour Solidarity, described sleeping in one room on the floor working whatever hours their Thai boss required of them, without pay and without a day off for two months. They had been kept in order by violence and by the threat of deportation if they complained. In Brazil, investigating the explosion in soya production in the Amazon region for my book Eat Your Heart Out, I heard of the slaves found on farms being cleared in the rainforest. A Dominican priest, Xavier Plassat, who campaigns to free them told me how he had just returned with government swat squads from a farm 60km off the road where 200 workers were being kept in slavery, labouring without pay, deprived of freedom of movement and controlled by debt bondage. They had no clean water and little food and were living 30 to a room. Plassat believed slavery and agribusiness were inextricably linked. Monoculture for export, the large-scale intensive farming dominated by transnational corporations (TNC), and favoured by trade rules and international financial institutions, had created the conditions for slavery by eliminating the traditional small scale farming that provided food for 60% of the Brazilian population. He is not alone. Kevin Bales, the great expert on modern slavery, has shown how driving peasant farmers off the land has created a new supply of dispossessed workers who can be pressed into this condition. Expansionist agriculture and empires have always depended on slave labour, as Latin authors of the Roman empire complained centuries ago. Today, we live in an era when the dominant powers don&apos;t officially &quot;do&quot; empire, so economic control takes a new privatised form in the TNC. Modern slavery has evolved to match. The straightforward ownership of chattel slavery is gone, replaced instead by an outsourced, subcontracted kind of control over people, which can be terminated when they have served their purpose. The transnationals universally abhor any idea of slavery or forced labour and yet it is found in their supply chains. Slaves and exploited migrants, often driven into migration by the squeeze on family agriculture, are what make the economics of today&apos;s agribusiness work. In a globalised world, footloose corporations have relocated to wherever labour and resources are cheapest. And then in order to compete, companies in the developed world have reimported the labour conditions of the least developed countries with the fewest protections back to Europe and the US. So even in rural England I have found examples of debt-bonded South African workers and Anti-Slavery International finds itself taking up the plight of Mexican farm workers suffering extreme exploitation in California. It was in part revulsion among consumers of the products of slavery in the 19th century that led to the movement to abolish it. The sugar trade of the 17th and 18th centuries unlocked the power of mass consumption in England. Slaves on the plantations of the Caribbean laboured to produce it, creating wealth that mostly returned to Britain, and for others to accumulate capital. They paid with their lives. But it was also the sugar trade that threw up one of the earliest examples of ethical shopping. An early 19th century sugar bowl in London&apos;s Museum of Docklands is inscribed with the message: &quot;East India Sugar not made by Slaves. By Six Families using East India instead of West India sugar, one less slave is required.&quot; Like so much ethical shopping it exposes its own limitations. Abolishing slavery in the 19th century required reform of a whole political and economic system. How should we respond to news of slavery re-emerging today? Stamping it out needs as big an overhaul of prevailing power structures as previously. And yet, it was on small tokens of concern that a political movement against slavery was originally built. It&apos;s time we made our revulsion clear again.", "publicationDate": "2010-10-03T14:30:00Z", "tags": ["Slavery", "World news", "Global development"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/03/modern-slavery-globalisation-multinationals", "title": "We've got to stamp out modern slavery | Felicity Lawrence", "sentences": ["On the subcontracted farms around Bangkok that supply the international poultry processing factories I found illegal Burmese migrants trapped in debt bondage and forced labour."]}, {"article": "The Thai government is planning to repatriate Burmese asylum seekers after Burma holds its first elections in 20 years next month, raising fears that refugees could be sent back to war zones. Speaking in New York, the Thai foreign minister, Kasit Piromya, said returning Burmese to their homeland was a priority for the Thai government. &quot;I am going back to Bangkok, and one of the first things I will be doing is to launch a more comprehensive programme for the Myanmar people in the camps, the displaced persons, the intellectuals that run around the streets of Bangkok and Chiang Mai province, to prepare them to return to Myanmar after the elections,&quot; he said. Thailand is home to an estimated 2\u00a0million Burmese, most of whom have no documents and many of whom have fled ethnic and political persecution. Others are economic migrants, forming an underclass on which the Thai economy depends because they work in menial, often dangerous and low-paid jobs. About 150,000 Burmese live in camps on the Thai-Burma border. The Thai government believes next month&apos;s poll in Burma \u2013 the first since 1990 \u2013 will mark a significant step towards democracy, and Kasit said: &quot;Let&apos;s encourage and let&apos;s given them as much help as possible. &quot;We are going to prepare the Myanmar people in Thailand for an eventual return to a new Myanmar, maybe half-democratic, but I think it is a beginning.&quot; But aid workers and refugee advocates in Thailand believe little will change after the elections and say Burma will not be safe enough for refugees to return. The Burmese military&apos;s Union Solidarity and Development party is set to dominate the elections for the 498-seat parliament through having more candidates across the country, raising millions of dollars by selling off state assets and by intimidating of opponents. A new constitution guarantees a quarter of all seats, as well as key ministries, for the army. Andy Hall, a director with the Human Rights and Development Foundation, said asylum seekers should not be returned to areas in which they could face further persecution. &quot;Essentially, this is an election which is going to entrench military rule,&quot; he added. &quot;So how, in any way, that could create a situation whereby the ethnic groups could go back after the elections when there is still a lot of conflict within their territories, we don&apos;t understand.&quot; Jackie Pollock, the director of the Map Foundation, which works with Burmese migrant workers in the north of Thailand, said Burma would not become suddenly safe for the junta&apos;s political opponents after the poll. &quot;I think, for the refugees and the political exiles, the elections will not make any difference \u2013 nothing will change in Burma for them,&quot; she added. &quot;The same people will be in charge \u2013 so these people, were they to be returned, are liable to face persecution.&quot; Others working on the Thai-Burma border spoke anonymously to the Guardian, saying that a mass repatriation from Thailand would not work.", "publicationDate": "2010-10-03T14:47:59Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/03/thailand-repatriate-burma-asylum-seekers-election", "title": "Thailand plans to repatriate Burmese asylum seekers after election", "sentences": ["&quot;I am going back to Bangkok, and one of the first things I will be doing is to launch a more comprehensive programme for the Myanmar people in the camps, the displaced persons, the intellectuals that run around the streets of Bangkok and Chiang Mai province, to prepare them to return to Myanmar after the elections,&quot; he said."]}, {"article": "After Mamma Mia! found success at cinemas from Barrow-in-Furness to Bangkok, copycat projects seemed inevitable. A cinematic musical inspired by the work of Suicidal Tendencies, perhaps, or Another Day in Paradise \u2013 the heartwarming tale of a homeless man who learns to dance, set to the music of Phil Collins. Today the Beach Boys have beaten both to the punch, but will they live to regret it? Those members who are still alive, that is. Here&apos;s the plan. Twentieth Century Fox, is, according to Variety, to develop a movie that, like Mamma Mia!, sets a dramatic story to to the music of the Beach Boys. It will be produced by one Craig Zadan, responsible for the success of both Chicago and Hairspray and written by the woman behind Erin Brockovich, Susannah Grant. It sounds like a big deal. But is it the right one? Fans of the Beach Boys might be bemused. Their music is beautiful to listen to, but \u2013 see Wouldn&apos;t It Be Nice \u2013 the lyrics are often in striking contrast, touching on themes such as loneliness, mortality and the transience of joy. Even John Travolta in latex might not be enough to turn that into a feelgood experience. Secondly, there&apos;s the quality of the music itself. One of the reasons the Beach Boys are still so revered is that Brian Wilson&apos;s compositions are awesomely refined and deliciously intricate. Quite how that will be replicated using a chorus line of, say, John Lithgow, Jason Bateman and Anne Heche is very much up for debate. You look at the possible tragic failure of such a venture, and at the pedigree of those producing it and see quickly that there is a disparity. Zadan might just know something I don&apos;t, and with a name that suggests an intergalactic despot, I wouldn&apos;t rule it out. What, after all, are the important criteria when it comes to developing a &quot;jukebox musical&quot;? That people know and love the music? The Beach Boys pass that test. That they inspire sentimental reverie on the part of the audience? Rightly or wrongly, the Beach Boys are associated indelibly with sun-kissed beaches and surf-toned tummies. Basically, whether its true to their legacy or not, a musical movie based on the Beach Boys has a high chance of being successful. Expect a coming of age tale set in a small beach town.

Russian Viktor Bout, nicknamed the &quot;Merchant of Death&quot; for his alleged arms smuggling network which spanned three continents and a decade, has been fighting US efforts to extradite him since he was arrested in a sting operation in a Bangkok hotel in 2008. But a Thai court today dismissed secondary charges of money laundering and fraud against the 43-year-old, clearing the way for extradition. He faces charges in the US of conspiring to kill American citizens. The court said Bout could be extradited after 72 hours, meaning he could be moved as soon as Friday if the Thai government gives its \u2013 expected \u2013 approval. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva has already said he would make the final decision on Bout&apos;s extradition. Shackled in leg-irons, Bout was led from court by armed soldiers in flak jackets and balaclavas. He said he would fight the allegations but he could not get a fair trial in the US. &quot;American lawyers are expensive. I have no money now.&quot; Bout&apos;s wife, Alla, said his US case would be a show trial designed to discredit the Russian government, with whom he is said to have close links. &quot;I don&apos;t have any idea when the extradition will happen,&quot; she said. &quot;But I believe it will happen very quickly, maybe even within the next few hours.&quot; She said the charges against her husband were a fantasy and that American interests &quot;had created an image of Viktor Bout as the Merchant of Death. It is not true.&quot; The US alleges Bout, a former Soviet air force officer, used a fleet of cargo planes throughout the 1990s to traffick weapons to Africa, Central America and the Middle East. He is alleged to have brokered weapons deals in Afghanistan, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Sudan, and to have armed the militaries of the former Liberian dictator Charles Taylor and the Libyan dictator, Muammar Gaddafi. Bout was arrested in 2008 after reportedly telling US agents posing as Colombian guerrillas that he could supply them with hundreds of surface-to-air missiles, more than 5000 AK-47s, millions of rounds of ammunition, as well as C4 explosive, landmines and unmanned aerial drones. He has maintained he never traded in weapons, but ran a legitimate air cargo business. The issue of his extradition is sensitive for Thailand. Whichever decision it arrives at, it will displease a major trading partner and key ally. An official from government house at the hearing told the Guardian: &quot;This is not a good decision for Thailand. These countries are big countries, they are important to Thailand, and whatever decision we make we will make one of them angry with Thailand. We cannot win.&quot; The Bout camp has argued the prosecution has been politically motivated from the outset. Unsubtle pressure has been exerted from both sides, with US and Russian politicians publicly leaning on Thailand to make a decision in their favour.

We hope to travel for about six days after the wedding. I had set my heart on going north, maybe to ski. However, I have found that it takes a while to get there, trains are unreliable and there may not be snow in January! Have you any suggestions for a trip with some train travel but not spending all the time travelling. We will have visited Agra on a day trip between the wedding and New Year. We are well travelled, enjoy activities but are equally at home just taking photos and enjoying the sights and smells of new places. Michelle Rowley, Dublin I haven&apos;t been to the north of India in winter but from talking to those who have I would concur that going to the far north is not a recipe for smooth travel at this time of year. If you had longer, I&apos;d suggest going for it and having fun with the challenge, but as you only have six days I can&apos;t help but think you should set your sights a little closer to Delhi. Four hours away is the country town of Gwalior, with an excellent fort and palace and a wonderful hotel for a treat, the Usha Kiran Palace (tajhotels.com). Gwalior is also a good base for visiting the temples at Shivpuri and the historic town of Datia, and you could travel on from Gwalior to Khajuraho \u2013 car transfer is easiest \u2013 to see the famous copulating statues before heading back to Delhi. You could, at a push, add in Varanasi too, depending on how much energy you have. This is India we&apos;re talking about though \u2013 and there are vast possibilities and alternatives to consider. As an example, Tom Robbins&apos; ski trip to Kashmir from last winter may set you off in the direction you had originally intended to go. Readers thoughts on this are more than welcome. We are intending to fly from London to Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, in mid-January. We then have to book our own flights from Dar to Stone Town in Zanzibar \u2013 is it better to book them from the UK or wait until we have arrived at Dar?Sigi You don&apos;t have to fly to Zanzibar at all \u2013 there are several fast ferry and slower boat services from Dar es Salaam which provide a wonderful \u2013 if sometimes stomach-churning \u2013 introduction to the island. This Thorn Tree post outlines options for travelling by sea, as well as suggesting that booking a day or so ahead at weekends for the ferry is a good idea. If you&apos;re travelling in early January and do choose to fly, then book your flights from Dar to Zanzibar in advance. The advice is the same if you don&apos;t want to hang around in Dar for a few days before travelling. Booking in advance means you won&apos;t risk being held up and gives you a fixed point around which to book hotels. If you&apos;re going later in January, which is a quieter time, and were going to spend a day or two in Dar anyway then you can make arrangements for travel to Zanzibar when you get there. There are plenty of local operators who will help you, such as Zanzibar Magic. I am going to Melbourne in December to visit my sister who I haven&apos;t seen for two years. I would like to take her away for a few nights somewhere, no further than two hours from Melbourne. Any ideas for a relaxing two-night break, maybe with some yoga or spa facilities? I am on a budget of \u00a3300 for both of us.Astrid Perry Look no further \u2013 the towns of Daylesford and Hepburn Springs in rural Victoria are the spa centre of the state and attract Melburnians in need of pampering, doubtless after too many nights sampling the pop-up bar scene of the city&apos;s atmospheric laneways. Both less than two hours away from central Melbourne and in lake, hill and forest scenery, these towns attract plenty of weekend traffic \u2013 when prices at the most popular spas can shoot well out of your budget. Even during the week you&apos;ll do well to put something together that comes in at less than A$490, which is all that \u00a3300 buys you in these days of pound poverty. The usual way to put together a visit to a spa is to book a B&amp;B and day spa treatments separately. A few places to try include Salus at the Lake House and Hepburn Spa Resort , the latter of which has detailed accommodation suggestions too. Alternatively, if this doesn&apos;t come within budget \u2013 and you&apos;re going to have to go very light on treatments to bring this trip in under \u00a3300 \u2013 you could have one night at a spa, then check into a hotel for another night and spend that day walking some of the wonderful trails around each town, getting some fresh air and relaxation. You may also find Tourism Victoria has a few good suggestions. I am planning a trip from London to Bangkok to Brisbane to Santiago to Buenos Aires over a three-month period. Do you think the round-the-world ticket with STA or Trailfinders is the most economical way to do this or would it work out cheaper to book the flights ourselves with smaller airlines?Chris Broughall The devil&apos;s in the detail around when you want to fly and with whom, but in general you&apos;re much better off getting a RTW. Key to all of this is the difficulty of finding reasonable prices for flights which neither start nor end in the UK, when booking from here. Agents aren&apos;t particularly keen on doing this and, even if they are willing, don&apos;t have access to anything other than (expensive) published fares. You could pick up tickets as you travel \u2013 after all, most countries don&apos;t ask to see an onward ticket unless they are looking for a reason to stop you coming in \u2013 but you will be a hostage to fortune when it comes to getting out again, and will almost certainly end up paying more than you would with a decent RTW. This is especially true on flights into and out of South America, including trans-Pacific routes from Australia, where there isn&apos;t the competition on routes from Europe to Asia which keeps prices keen. If you&apos;re still not convinced, with an RTW you often have far more flexibility to amend flight dates or even routes than you would if you were making your own arrangements. In short, go for the RTW.

As well as having concentrated much of its football-development efforts on Africa, England supported Issa Hayatou&apos;s failed bid to become Fifa president eight years ago. As a Fifa vice-president Hayatou is Africa&apos;s most influential member of the executive committee and there is a feeling that his gratitude for England&apos;s support remains.

I arrived to this part of the season playing well, but probably a little bit more tired than usual.&quot; Melzer said: &quot;I felt he was uncomfortable after a few games. His backhand was sometimes just dying in the net. The key was to put a lot of pressure on him. You cannot let him play his game. He&apos;s just too good.&quot; Murray, meanwhile, plays another Frenchman, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, tomorrow and said: &quot;I feel way better than I did 10 days ago.&quot; Ten days ago he was as low as he has been all season, struck down by illness that left his head throbbing and robbed his limbs of energy as he staggered away from the China Open in Beijing. But Murray has learned how to come back from adversity. Today his tennis was full of punchy forehands, more drop shots \u2013 a few of them excellent, a couple not so good \u2013 and a nerveless service game that kept Chardy deep behind the baseline. Talented and dangerous, Chardy rarely stretched the relaxed Scot in the 81 minutes their match lasted in front of a small crowd at the 15,000-seat main stadium court at this well-appointed complex on the outskirts of Shanghai. &quot;The two weeks between now and Valencia [where he won last year] will be important for me so that I train properly and get myself in good match shape again,&quot; Murray said. &quot;There&apos;s not much point in trying to get stronger or faster because there&apos;s not really enough time. But I&apos;ll try to improve that little bit by spending more time on the court and then December is when I&apos;ll work really, really hard again. &quot;I know exactly where I&apos;m going to be and what I&apos;m going to do in terms of the Hopman Cup and preparations for the Australian Open. But I&apos;ll sit down after here and talk about what the goals are physically in that period and to make sure I spend enough time on the court, enough time in the gym.&quot; While Nadal chose to play on after the US Open, reaching the semi-finals in Bangkok and winning in Tokyo last week, Federer rested \u2013 and he looks ominously fresh and strong, beating the Italian Andreas Seppi 6-3, 6-4 tonight.", "publicationDate": "2010-10-14T08:15:29Z", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Tennis", "Sport", "Rafael Nadal", "French Open"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/oct/14/andy-murray-shanghai-masters", "title": "Andy Murray's spirits soar after place on world top table is secured", "sentences": ["But I&apos;ll sit down after here and talk about what the goals are physically in that period and to make sure I spend enough time on the court, enough time in the gym.&quot; While Nadal chose to play on after the US Open, reaching the semi-finals in Bangkok and winning in Tokyo last week, Federer rested \u2013 and he looks ominously fresh and strong, beating the Italian Andreas Seppi 6-3, 6-4 tonight."]}, {"article": "Desire fulfilled is a dangerous thing, we are told by the moralists. Be careful of what you want, they warn. You might end up getting it. Once, when I was 20 years old and the thing I&apos;d wanted above all else was suddenly granted me, I came to understand the truth in that warning. Where does the desire of a lifetime begin? Mine began, I think, with snow. The earliest games I remember playing as a child in Rangoon involved snow. Our home in those days of the early 1950s was on two floors of a four-storey edifice called the Thomas de la Rue building. Money was minted in that building \u2013 or had been until just before the war, when the British were still running Burma. &quot;Don&apos;t think money grows on trees!&quot; my mother was fond of saying. Of course I didn&apos;t think money grew on trees. It was printed downstairs, on old machines. Upstairs, on the top storey, was the North Pole: a big empty loft where I would try to lead my playmates on pretend Arctic expeditions. Snow was a miracle, a chimera, that called me to impossibly distant places. As I grew older, I listened, rapt, to stories brought home by my older siblings who had studied and travelled in America; by my father, describing his first opera while on a press junket to Europe (&quot;Crying over a lost coat! Too funny!&quot;); by multilingual friends whose parents were posted to places like Paris, Rome, Belgrade\u2026 I couldn&apos;t wait for my turn, when I&apos;d see for myself the wonders of a world as sprawling as the landscape in that fairytale, &quot;East of the Sun and West of the Moon.&quot; At 16 \u2013 with school behind me and a music scholarship in California awaiting me; with my blue Samsonite suitcase packed and repacked daily, months ahead of schedule \u2013 it seemed my time had come. Then, in March 1963, with only three months to go, everything changed. One night, a car drew up under our front porch and woke my mother. Seeing an army Jeep outside, she shook my father awake. He looked at his watch as he got out of bed. Three o&apos;clock in the morning. At the front door was a young man in uniform. &quot;Uncle,&quot; said the captain, &quot;let&apos;s go. And don&apos;t touch the telephone, please.&quot; When she looked out the window my mother saw that the house was surrounded. Apart from the Jeep, there was an open truck full of armed soldiers, and an army station wagon. In this station wagon our father was taken away. Only later in the day, when we children woke up one by one, did my mother realise that not only could she not tell us where he had been taken to, she couldn&apos;t be sure who his captors were. The army, she assumed. But how could she be certain when there was nothing to go on: no charge, no warrant, no witnesses apart from herself? Days passed, then weeks, then months \u2013 and still we were in the dark about where Dad had been taken, or when if ever we would see him again. One day, eight months after his disappearance, an official letter finally arrived. Editor U Law-Yone (my father was editor and publisher of the leading English-language daily, the Rangoon Nation) was &quot;under protective custody&quot;. He would be allowed to write one letter home every other week. On alternating weeks he could receive one letter from home. No letter should exceed two handwritten pages. There was no mention of visits \u2013 then, or at any time in the five years to follow. Not long after my father&apos;s arrest, I gathered the nerve to broach a difficult subject: my passport. My mother looked at me, uncomprehending. &quot;What passport?&quot; &quot;Shouldn&apos;t we be applying for it?&quot; I said. &quot;We&apos;re running out of time.&quot; My mother said, &quot;You must be joking.&quot; Then, seeing I wasn&apos;t joking, &quot;I can&apos;t believe this. Your father&apos;s in jail \u2013 or worse \u2013 and you&apos;re still thinking of leaving? You are that selfish?&quot; I was, in fact, that selfish. It seemed to me urgent to leave, especially because my father had been arrested. Something told me we weren&apos;t going to see him any time soon. Prime minister U Nu and his cabinet ministers had been picked up a year ago, when the military took over, and they were still in jail. More and more politicians, journalists and students were disappearing in the dragnet cast by the MIS \u2013 the Military Intelligence Service. Businesses were being nationalised or shut down without compensation. Foreign nationals \u2013 even those whose families had lived in Burma for generations \u2013 were stripped of their assets and ordered out of the country. Things were getting worse, not better, I reasoned; and what good was I to anyone if I stayed? My mother ended our Mexican standoff with one of her edicts. &quot;You&apos;re not going. And that&apos;s that.&quot; Then she burst into tears, and I went off to seethe with self-pity and impotent rage. Months later, following her advice to &quot;make the best of things&quot;, I was enrolled in Rangoon University. But halfway through the first term, both my mother and I were summoned to the registrar&apos;s office. There we were informed that, as the daughter of a political prisoner, I\u00a0was officially barred from classes \u2013 at the university or at any other institute of learning. I could see my mother biting her lip and hoped she wouldn&apos;t cry. When she did, I hated her even more than I hated the registrar, and shot her a look that said, &quot;See? What did I tell you? And you wanted me to stay.&quot; The pile-up of frustrations gave me licence, as I saw it, to sulk and mope. To escape the assaults of a large household, I locked myself in my room, emerging only for meals, bristling at the slightest taunt or tease from my brothers and sisters. The bed in my room was a pull-out sofa that I never bothered to pull out, sleeping uncomfortably on the narrow seat, my bed of nails. I fell into the habit of sleeping fully clothed, prepared to jump up at a moment&apos;s notice \u2013 and flee. When not plotting revenge on one adversary or another, I was plotting escape. I had stopped playing the piano altogether (another act of protest which, maddeningly, no one seemed to notice), but on my portable record player I listened to the same handful of LPs \u2013 Gershwin&apos;s Rhapsody in Blue, Eartha Kitt, a Segovia album \u2013 dreaming all the while of faraway places. In my fantasies, I drove the smooth highways of America in an open convertible. I roamed the caf\u00e9s of Paris, rubbing shoulders with Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. I sat in the front row of a concert hall in Moscow, watching the hands of the great Sviatoslav Richter on the keyboard of a Steinway grand. I dreamed, like Bing Crosby, of a white Christmas. One day I was invited to a piano recital at the Goethe Institute in Rangoon. The British Council and the Alliance Fran\u00e7aise had already begun to pull up stakes and leave, but the Germans still soldiered on in their cultural mission. During the intermission, I met an American couple who introduced me to their house guest, another American by the name of Sterling. We sat and talked for about 20 minutes. Then, when the concert was over, we went our separate ways: Sterling to San Francisco, where he was living at the time, and I to my bed of nails. Six months later, Sterling and I were launched on a long-distance romance. The forbidden nature of it appealed to our mutual love of secrecy, danger and adventure. For the next year and a half, we wrote to each other almost daily. Our letters escaped the post office censors by coming and going through the diplomatic pouch, thanks to sympathetic embassy friends. For the first time in a long while, I was no longer fixated on escape and flight. I was too busy composing letters that I hoped would impress Sterling, a journalist by profession, and the last word, it seemed to me, in epistolary savoir-faire. I sat at my grey Smith Corona, a dictionary by my side, a wheel-and-brush eraser at the ready. For hours I typed and erased, often tearing the onion-skin stationery that had quickly turned purple from my laboured prose. We were married in Rangoon, two years from the date of our first meeting. I was 20, Sterling 10 years older. The wedding was a subdued and surreal affair, with the MIS tailing us to the courthouse and back \u2013 and many long faces in attendance as the day wore on and it became obvious that the authorities were not going to release my father for the occasion. The ceremonies over, Sterling was once more obliged to leave: as a foreigner, he could only stay for the duration of a 24-hour transit visa. Over the next few months, Sterling flew in and out of the country, while I tried repeatedly to apply for a passport \u2013 each time to no avail. It appeared that my chances were no better now that I was married to an American; if anything, they were worse. All Americans were potential CIA agents in the eyes of the MIS. It was time, we decided, for me to take the &quot;back door&quot; \u2013 the underground route to Thailand favoured by smugglers, petty criminals and insurgents. Early one morning in May, I\u00a0set out for the train station with my brother, Alban, and a gem smuggler who had agreed to lead us through the eastern jungles to a safe crossing at the border with Thailand. We never made it that far. At the river port of Moulmein, on the very first leg of our journey, we were picked up by the secret police and brought back to Rangoon. Once at the MIS headquarters, my brother and I were separated and held in different rooms. The interrogations lasted from nine at night to nine the next morning, the officers working in teams of four, changing shifts at 3am. For the next 10 days, the routine was unvarying: every night, just before nine, a guard would unlock the door to lead me downstairs, into the self-same office, where I was asked to take a seat across the desk from the interrogators. Just before 9am, I would be led back to my room. Feverish with despair, I&apos;d throw myself on to the cot that had been set up for me in the windowless office where I slept. &quot;What makes you think,&quot; the colonel had said with a pleasant smile, when I had asked for the umpteenth time, &quot;that you&apos;re ever going to be released?&quot; I was doomed, I now knew. Just as my father was doomed. I was never going to get out of jail. Nor was he. Every Christmas a card would arrive at our house from an organisation called Amnesty International, assuring the &quot;prisoner of conscience&quot; that he was not forgotten. And for a few weeks my mother would allow herself to hope that important people outside the country were busy engineering her husband&apos;s release. Now I saw that nothing could possibly come of any talk of release. Now I knew what protective custody meant. It meant you could be locked up one day just like that, and remain locked up until God alone knew when \u2014 and not a thing in the world could be done about it. I made a vow to myself then: if, by miracle, I ever made it out of jail and managed to leave the country, I would never, ever, come back to live in such a\u00a0wretched place again. Miracles do happen, even in police states. Ten days after our arrest, without warning or explanation, my brother and I\u00a0were allowed to go home. Even more astonishing, Colonel Chit Khin, the chief of Military Intelligence himself, put in a\u00a0bouncy appearance to sign our release order. Reminding me that we had once played tennis to- gether, he then assured me that an exit permit would be granted me within 10 days. In the event, 10 days turned into three months, as a wave of violent anti-Chinese riots brought the city to a standstill and martial law was declared. But against all odds, just as I was beginning to give up hope, a messenger cycled up to our front door one morning and handed me my ticket to freedom: an exit permit and a certificate of identity, the stateless person&apos;s passport. On the night of 15 July 1967, I drove to Mingaladon airport in the spooky atmosphere of a war-time blackout. Because a curfew was still in effect, nobody came to see me off, but our driver, Maung Thein Htun, tried in his quiet way to make up for the lonely send-off. He had brought me as a going-away present a small paperback, a Burmese cookbook. Whenever I felt homesick, he said, I could follow one of those recipes. Then maybe I would think of him a little, too. From my seat in the back I could see the sad movement of his Adam&apos;s apple. The airport seemed utterly deserted and for once even the MIS were out of sight. Then a Thai International attendant appeared, led me to the ticket counter and before I knew it I was being escorted aboard Thai International Flight TG304, where I discovered that I was the one and only passenger. It was my first time on a jet and I was white-knuckled: not from fear of flying, but from fear of flying back. Just before boarding I had overheard an exchange between two members of the ground crew. Point of no-return, was what one of them had said jokingly. Something about how on a short flight like the one before us (we were flying from Rangoon to Bangkok, an hour-and-a-half away), there was no point of no-return. No point of no-return! But what did that mean? That the plane could be ordered to turn back at any time, right up to the verge of landing? The alarming paradox held me in thrall for the rest of the flight \u2013 until the plane touched down at Don Muang International airport right on schedule, the wheels skipping a little before coming to a stop. Out on the tarmac, two strangers were waving to me. One of them, I realised with a start, was my husband. Endings, like beginnings, are never as clear-cut as we wish them to be. One life had ended for me, thank God, and a new life had begun. The commercials on the television sets in Bangkok all seemed to shout out my hard-won status. FREE! FREE! FREE! The world was my apple. The sky was the limit. And I soon found out that my persistent nausea was not just a\u00a0case of nerves: I was pregnant. There was a small problem of how we were going to live, for we had no money. Sterling had quit his job with a San Francisco television station to &quot;spirit&quot; me out of Burma, as he put it, and I, of course, had no credentials, no &quot;marketable skills&quot;. But we were rich, we felt, in other ways. And we would soon be rich in the usual way, too, for someone at MGM was &quot;wildly excited&quot; about a script that Sterling had written. We flew to Los Angeles and found a cheap apartment in West Hollywood, near enough to the studios to facilitate negotiations. (Daryl, the MGM executive, turned out to be a bankrupt shyster who was using stolen MGM stationery \u2013 but that&apos;s another story.) The apartment had a large plastic tree that took up half the living space, but we could hang things on it: clothes, large paper clips to hold newspaper clippings, even a stuffed mouse with enormous ears, a gift to me from Sterling, named Mousey Tung. It was Mousey Tung I clutched to my belly when the cramps began one night. I thought at first it might be indigestion from the excess of Kraft&apos;s Green Goddess salad dressing I&apos;d poured on my iceberg lettuce, but the cramping continued for hours before letting up and allowing sleep. I felt fine the next day \u2013 until late evening, when the cramps returned with a vengeance. This time they lasted most of the night. Poor Mousey Tung&apos;s wire ears were misshapen by morning. On the third night, when the dread signs began, Sterling borrowed a friend&apos;s car to drive me to the hospital. The young resident who examined me said, &quot;You&apos;re trying to abort.&quot; &quot;No, I&apos;m not!&quot; I snapped, mistaking the diagnosis for accusation. He gave me an injection and sent me home to rest. I got into the back seat of the car so I could lie down. We drove out of the hospital and on to roads where the signs and billboards flashing by were exactly like the neon-lit vistas I had imagined as a teenager, when I drove the open highways in my daydreams. But before long I could think of nothing but the pain tearing through my abdomen. Once, when it seemed as if we had been driving for hours, I screamed for Sterling to stop, for God&apos;s sake, and do something, but we were on one of the great freeways of southern California, caught on a particularly long stretch between exits, and when Sterling screamed back, &quot;What do you want me to DO?&quot; I feared an accident and went back to moaning and writhing and clawing the air. &quot;We&apos;re almost home, almost home,&quot; he kept saying, and I\u00a0had ceased to believe him when suddenly we were stopped right in front of our apartment \u2013 and suddenly, miraculously, the pain stopped, too. I was trembling with relief as I got out of the car \u2013 and still trembling when I felt the important gush between my legs that told me it was all over now, there was nothing to be done about it. Once in bed I was overcome with relief that bordered on euphoria. The pain was gone, and I was alive. Things happen for a reason, I told myself. The baby was not meant to be, clearly. The pregnancy must have been doomed from the start. Or maybe it was just that a price had to be paid for the freedom I&apos;d won \u2013 and this was the very price. I felt calm, even peaceful, as I accepted my loss. Then I felt weak with hunger. I had a powerful craving for my mother&apos;s chicken stew. One thing I could say about my mother: no matter how busy she might be, or how angry at me, I could always count on her special chicken stew to speed up my recovery from any illness. I remembered a story she&apos;d once told me about the child she had lost \u2013 and suddenly it was as if she was sitting on the edge of my bed, telling me the story again. &quot;Alban was just a baby, your father&apos;s deaf aunt was helping to take care of him, when his little brother was born \u2013 31 January, I still remember the day. We named him John. When the baby was eight months old, he suddenly got very sick and broke out in sores. The doctor came \u2013 and just stood at the door to the bedroom. He took one look at the baby and wouldn&apos;t come any closer. &quot;Take him to the hospital right away,&quot; was all he said. &quot;I suppose I knew at the back of my mind that there was a smallpox epidemic going on, but I refused to let myself think about it. In the hospital, of course, there was no escaping the horror. All around us people were dying and being carried away. I stayed with the baby day and night for I don&apos;t know how many days. I remember hearing somebody say that human saliva could cure those sores, so I kept on licking the baby&apos;s hot little body all over, praying and praying for a miracle. &quot;I don&apos;t even know how they managed to get me away from the baby when it died, how I was able to leave him there. But I remember coming home and the dog going wild. It just knew, I suppose. It kept jumping all over me, licking me and making crying noises. I remember sitting in the living room and staring at nothing for a long, long time, just like that. Daddy brought me some ice cream, but I couldn&apos;t touch it, I couldn&apos;t look at it.&quot; When Sterling came to kneel by the bedside and comfort me, saying, &quot;We&apos;ll have another; it will be all right,&quot; I\u00a0didn&apos;t know how to tell him that what I wanted at the moment was not to have another child \u2013 it was to go home and tell my mother I was sorry. Three months later, our Hollywood illusions behind us, we moved to New York City, where I found a job, a minor clerical position, with a big German firm. My boss, a salesman by the name of Eugene Koch, seemed like the kindest man on earth. I celebrated my first white Christmas with a beautiful Douglas fir tree that someone had left on the street. I hadn&apos;t met Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, but I had seen Julie Christie browsing in a tiny boutique in Sausalito. And I hadn&apos;t yet heard Sviatoslav Richter play, but the mother of a friend of ours had two extra tickets to the Metropolitan Opera, where I slept soundly through The Ride of the Valkyries. It was spring of the next year, and I was pregnant again when I received a pile of mail that had been forwarded along to me from one past address to another. In it was a letter from my father, sent from 116B University Avenue, Rangoon, and dated 4 March 1968. My darling daughter, As soon as I came home we dashed off a cable to you. You must be footloose somewhere because you have not yet responded. But everything here reminds me of you: even this typewriter which was clogged up with your old eraser shavings\u2026 Wars and rumours of war; men withering away in expectation of what shall befall them. There has been no change since I went in\u2026 You are old enough and sensible enough to know that my imprisonment has been a blessing in disguise. We have all recovered from the ordeal we have been through. Other families lose the head at one fell swoop \u2013 in our case there was a dress rehearsal to prepare everyone for the day when the show opens in earnest, Daddy But the show had already opened in earnest for me. I was a grown-up now. And if I didn&apos;t jump up and down in exultation at the news of my father&apos;s release, it was because I had learned that beginnings, like endings, are never as clear-cut as we imagine.", "publicationDate": "2010-10-16T23:05:18Z", "tags": ["South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/17/my-childhood-in-burma", "title": "'Miracles do happen, even in a police state': My childhood in Burma", "sentences": ["Something about how on a short flight like the one before us (we were flying from Rangoon to Bangkok, an hour-and-a-half away), there was no point of no-return.", "The commercials on the television sets in Bangkok all seemed to shout out my hard-won status."]}, {"article": "&quot;Most managers were players before they became managers,&quot; writes Mike Oberbichler. &quot;Is there a coach or manager in football who did something completely different \u2013 a plumber, blacksmith or baker, for example \u2013 or who had little or no connection to football before his coaching career?&quot; Well, Mike, there are plenty, even among the most successful sides in the world. Take the mighty Brazil, for example, where several coaches of the national side had little connection with football before taking up the managerial reins. Claudio Coutinho started the trend. In 1970 the then fitness instructor with the Brazilian army helped M\u00e1rio Zagallo&apos;s team get fit for the World Cup in Mexico. Eight years later (having coached the Brazil side at the Montreal Olympics) he was in Zagallo&apos;s seat at the 1978 tournament. Unsuprisingly his background meant it was all too easy for his side to be criticised for their increasingly reliance on athleticism over artistry. Sebastiao Lazaroni, described by the Guardian&apos;s Paddy Agnew in 1990 as &quot;the modern day Martin Luther who has guided the reformation of Brazillian soccer, introducing such heretic notions as two sweepers, a five-man defence and full-backs who can tackle&quot;, was appointed manager of la Selecao in January 1989, although his first managerial job came at Flamengo in 1985. Though a committed student of the game, he had never played professionally and after a brief stint as a goalkeeper in amateur football became a PE teacher, before joining the Rio club&apos;s backroom staff. After Falcao&apos;s unimpressive succession to Lazaroni, Brazil turned to Carlos Alberto Parreira. Parreira&apos;s career had also been largely fitness-based, although in 1967 the Brazilian government had sent the 24-year-old coach to take charge of the Ghana national side. He returned to Brazil to work as a physical trainer for several club sides, and was with the national side (along with Coutinho) in 1970. His first shot at the top job came in Kuwait in the late 70s. &quot;I started out as a fitness coach and, though I&apos;d played football all my life, I never played professionally,&quot; said Parreira. &quot;But there reached a point in my life where I was so well qualified that I was almost pushed into taking on a head coach&apos;s role. In Kuwait they asked me to take charge of their youth sides and that was the start of a long career.&quot; There&apos;s also a history of this sort of thing in Glasgow. Bill Struth, Rangers manager between 1920 and 1954, was a stonemason by trade, but also an outstanding middle-distance runner, an athletic prowess that no doubt helped him earn training positions at Clyde and then Hearts before his move to Glasgow. The 23-year-old Guy Roux took charge of Auxerre in 1961 without any coaching experience other than a month as an &quot;observer&quot; at Crystal Palace. He was appointed based on his promise &quot;balance the books and never to waste a penny&quot; rather than his football experience. Forty-four amazing years later, the club utterly changed, he finally resigned. The story of Les Parry&apos;s journey from shipwright, to airframe fitter, to physiotherapy student and all the way to current manager of Tranmere Rovers, is told in full here, while Arrigo Saachi was a shoe salesman (and amateur player) before becoming a coach, and when his pedigree was questioned on his appointment to the Italian national side came out with the famous: &quot;I never realised that in order to become a jockey you have to have been a horse first.&quot; G\u00e9rard Houllier (teacher) and Brian Kerr (lab technician) also enjoyed careers away from the game before concentrating on coaching. And one of the more bizarre cases is flagged up by Philip Copley. In a shroud of political intrigue Austrian hotelier Gerry Saurer was appointed manager of the Kenyan national side in 1992. Unsuprisingly, it wasn&apos;t much of a success, with players alleged to have played poorly in some games in an attempt to have Saurer removed. He did, though, coach the Kenyan side at the African Cup of Nations. The Observer&apos;s Brian Oliver had been there:  Bang. &apos;Man down&apos; said a drunken voice from the back. The man on the floor, who had just fallen three feet from a shelf running the length of the hotel room, was the manager of Kenya&apos;s national football team. Like everyone else there - the manager of Morocco, journalists and agents from Britain, Kenya and Austria - he had drunk too much vodka. This was in January, 1992. It was 2am at the Ngor Hotel in Dakar, Senegal. The man on the floor, who had been sitting on the shelf with the Morocco coach because there weren&apos;t enough chairs, had wanted to host the session himself. After a few beers by the pool, at midnight he marched us off to his room. He hadn&apos;t told us that there was someone asleep in the bed - his &apos;African lady friend&apos; as he put it. He was persuaded to move on to another room. A couple of hours later he got up off the floor and staggered off for a kip. His name was Gerry Saurer and he had been drowning his sorrows after his team had lost their win-or-bust encounter against Senegal that evening. Saurer was an Austrian hotel manager. He had never played professional football, but had dabbled in semi-professional coaching in Switzerland and the Seychelles, and when he pitched up in Kenya he somehow talked himself into becoming the national coach. Here he was at the African Cup of Nations, a good drinking companion but not setting a very good example at the beachside hotel where about 150 players were staying.  SIBLING RIVALRY &quot;Are Aberdeen&apos;s mercurial perma-crocked winger Sone Aluko and his even-more-skillful sister Eniola the only brother and sister with full international caps? If they are, how about the only brother and sister with full international caps for \u2026 different countries?&quot; wonders John Sinclair. &quot;I&apos;d like to think they are.&quot; Yes and no. &quot;Lyndon Hooper was capped by Canada 67 times, scoring three goals,&quot; writes Scott Bennett from Nova Scotia. &quot;His sister Charmaine represented Canada 131 times, scoring 71 goals.&quot; If that were not enough, the Charmaine is Canada&apos;s most-capped player and leading all-time scorer. But, although brothers have played for different national sides, it seems the Alukos might be a unique brother and sister act in this regard. FANS WITH UNLIKELY FRIENDSHIPS (2) Last week we looked at the teams whose fans have formed unlikely allegiances with their rivals. This week we&apos;ve been pointed towards a few of English sides who get along famously. &quot;Norwich and Sunderland fans have a long-standing friendship stemming from the 1985 Milk Cup final between the teams where supporters had a mass football match in the car park and swapped scarves,&quot; writes Ffion Thomas. &quot;Subsequently the teams have competed for the coveted Friendship Trophy [mentioned previously in our piece on trophies contested by only two teams], contested in each meeting between the two sides (and currently held by Sunderland). Kevin Baldwin&apos;s excellent diary of the 1992-93 season, &apos;Norfolk &apos;n&apos; Good&apos;, also describes a Norwich game away at Everton where Sunderland fans, whose game at Tranmere had been postponed, joined the City fans in the away end, leaving the local stewards unsure as to whether to separate the fans or let them get on with it.&quot;     Brighton fans protest at the final game at Goldstone Ground against Doncaster Rovers. Photograph: Ross Kinnaird/Allsport/Getty    While that friendship was forged in happy circumstances, adversity thrust together Brighton and Doncaster: &quot;Brighton developed cordial relations with a couple of clubs as a result of our tribulations in the late &apos;90s,&quot; writes Leo Eyles. &quot;Most notably, Doncaster Rovers, who were the last opponents at the Goldstone Ground in 1997. Both the players and the fans were incredibly supportive of our predicament at that time. The following season the club branded the match between the sides at Gillingham (where we were exiled) as &apos;The Heart of Football&apos; although this didn&apos;t stop it being a dull 0-0 draw between the two bottom teams in the Football League. The return game at Belle Vue was an altogether more feisty affair that the Donny fans chose for a protest against the dodgy owners: Brighton fans played a full part in the protests. It would be fitting if the first game at Falmer next year was against Donny.&quot; KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;Is Verein f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach the longest team name in football?&quot; asked Robert Bashford and Justin Walker back in 2005. Far from it chaps: Anglesey League team Clwb P\u00eal-droed Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch came pretty close to landing the prize with a weighty 70 letters, but Stuart Orford can do even better. &quot;My favourite is Dutch Eredivisie side NAC Breda,&quot; he begins somewhat unconvincingly. &quot;It expands to Nooit Opgeven Altijd Doorzetten Aangenaam Door Vermaak En Nuttig Door Ontspanning Combinatie Breda.&quot; Plenty, though, can beat a mere 86 characters. &quot;I&apos;d like to nominate my team, UCD, in the League of Ireland Premier Division,&quot; says Kevin Burke. &quot;Under some universities&apos; act a few years ago, we officially became University College Dublin, National University of Ireland Dublin, Association Football Club (81 letters). There are some who&apos;ll suggest that, with that hideous new crest, it should now (unofficially) be University College Dublin Dublin, National University of Ireland Dublin, Association Football Club (87 letters). This would translate into Irish as Cumann Sacair Ollscoil na h\u00c9ireann Baile \u00c1tha Cliath Baile \u00c1tha Cliath, Ollscoil N\u00e1isi\u00fanta na h\u00c9ireann Baile \u00c1tha Cliath, which is 102 letters and a comma.&quot; Not bad, Kevin, but a rival school of learning trumps it. &quot;I think you&apos;d have to go some to beat the full name in Thai of Bangkok University FC,&quot; claims Liam O&apos;Brien. &quot;This would include the longest place name in the world, using the official Thai name for Bangkok. When translated into English, it would run to 189 characters as follows: Samosorn Maha Vittiyalai Krungthep Mahanakorn Boworn Rattanakosin Mahintara Yutthaya Mahadilok Phop Noparat Rajathani Burirom Udom Rajaniwet Mahasatharn Amorn Phimarn Avatarn Sathit Sakkatattiya Vishnukarm Prasit.&quot; But there&apos;s an even longer name in the very same city! That of Thai Pro League side Bangkok Bravo. &quot;Should they ever wish to refer to themselves by their full (English translated) name,&quot; notes Dale Farrington, &quot;they would be called: Krung Thep Mahanakhon Amon Rattanakosin Mahinthara Ayuthaya Mahadilok Phop Noppharat Ratchathani Burirom Udomratchaniwet Mahasathan Amon Piman Awatan Sathit Sakkathattiya Witsanukam Prasit Bravo Association Football Club (196 characters).

Can you help? &quot;What is the last English top-flight club to put out a team without a single full international on the team or on the substitutes bench?&quot; wonders Padraig McAuliffe. &quot;My friend insists that all UK league football grounds are licensed as wedding venues. If this is true which team can boast the most fans able to convince their spouses to share vows on their hallowed turf?&quot; ponders Peter May &quot;While pondering the former players from my club \u2013 Queens Park \u2013 who hold current managerial positions with British senior clubs (as you do), I realised that all six I had come up with not only played for Queens but actually started their senior playing career there,&quot; writes Alistair Murdoch. &quot;Can any other club claim to have started so many current managers on their footballing career? Incidentally the six are Sir Alex Ferguson (Man Utd), Malky Mackay (Watford), Alan Irvine (Sheffield Wednesday), Ian McCall (Partick Thistle), Kenny Brannigan (Queen of the South), Jimmy Boyle (Airdrie Utd).&quot; Send your questions and answers to the lovely people at knowledge@guardian.co.uk ", "publicationDate": "2010-10-19T23:06:01Z", "tags": ["Brazil", "Football", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/oct/20/the-knowledge-football-manager", "title": "Has a butcher, baker or candlestick maker ever become a football manager? | The Knowledge", "sentences": ["&quot;I think you&apos;d have to go some to beat the full name in Thai of Bangkok University FC,&quot; claims Liam O&apos;Brien.", "&quot;This would include the longest place name in the world, using the official Thai name for Bangkok.", "That of Thai Pro League side Bangkok Bravo."]}, {"article": "This year&apos;s London film festival saw the most keenly anticipated comeback in British cinema \u2013 perhaps only the next movie by Lynne Ramsay is as impatiently awaited. Peter Mullan is the Scottish film-maker and actor whose 1997 debut picture, Orphans, was a film of intestine-tangling emotional power. Following that, The Magdalene Sisters \u2013 about the institutionalised abuse in Ireland&apos;s notorious Magdalene laundries \u2013 was a tremendous triumph, winning the Golden Lion at the Venice film festival and confirming Mullan as a directorial heavyweight. That was back in 2002. Since then, his admirers have been left wondering when his next film would arrive, with Mullan reportedly experienced some frustration getting backing for the films he wanted to make. In the meantime, he gave some great acting performances in works such as 2006&apos;s Children Of Men and the Red Riding TV trilogy, which screened in 2009. Now the wait is over: his new film, Neds (&quot;non-educated delinquents&quot;), is a film about growing up in 70s Glasgow; a coming-of-age tale that pours out of the screen in a number of emotional and narrative directions \u2013 perhaps the result of Mullan&apos;s pent-up frustration. It has muscular force, freewheeling energy and is by turns funny, tragic and scary, starting out resembling Distant Voices, Still Lives or the opening of Kes and drifting towards the menace of A Clockwork Orange. Yet I felt that Mullan had so much he wanted to say and so many ways to say it, and felt so deeply, variously, and personally about his story, that it left the film a little baggy and undisciplined. Much though I appreciated Neds, I felt that it could have had more structure, particularly in the final half-hour when it lost some shape and focus. Conor McCarron plays John McGill, a smart and hard-working boy in a tough Glasgow school who shows every sign of making it to university. His dad \u2013 played in cameo by Mullan himself \u2013 is an abusive drunk and his eldest brother a tearaway, involved in gangs and perpetually in trouble with the police. Miraculously, John looks like he&apos;s going to escape the quagmire of despair that pulls down the men of his family. But then something awful happens: a friendship with a middle-class boy sours, and sensitive, intelligent John feels the class slight far more keenly than most. A switch flips inside him, and Mullan cleverly shows that when a formidable and intelligent young man like John goes to the bad he will do so in a more spectacular way than your common-or-garden no-goodnik. Mullan&apos;s school scenes are all terrific, showing how the casual use of the strap to punish the most minor wrongdoing brutalises and degrades everyone. There is a superb cameo by Gary Lewis as a particularly intimidating schoolmaster \u2013 his presence brought Alistair Gray&apos;s Lanark into my mind \u2013 and a scene in which he deliberately embarrasses latecomers which is so toe-curlingly horrible I&apos;d bet anything it&apos;s taken from Mullan&apos;s own experiences. A scene at a youth-club disco, in which the boys are seen soundlessly passing word among themselves that an almighty punch-up is in the offing, reprises the famous sequence in The Magdalene Sisters when news of a sexual assault is passed on through whispers among wedding guests. As the film goes on, it drifts into the arena of melodrama. An hallucinatory encounter with the crucified Christ brings John close to his own crisis and a Freudian confrontation with his hated father \u2013 who has not, after all, managed to be a very important figure in the rest of the film. To my mind, there&apos;s something a little bizarre and strained in these elements, although they may well be taken directly from real life. What comes across with Neds is its sheer energy and punch. There is a moment when one lad, hanging out in a desolate playground, furiously lashes at a swing which spins around and around over its horizontal bar until its bunched up at the top \u2013 a potent image for the general rage and frustration. Mullan&apos;s final shot, meanwhile, is a masterpiece of surreal strangeness. Flawed though it may be, Neds has distinctive power and I look forward to revisiting it when it goes on general release. It&apos;s certainly a whole lot better than the deeply disappointing It&apos;s Kind of a Funny Story by writer-directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, who made the well-regarded Half Nelson. This is an indie comedy that seems dead set on repeating every dishonest movie cliche about psychiatric hospitals. Keir Gilchrist plays Craig, a quirky mixed-up teen who checks himself into a New York City mental health unit after threatening to commit suicide and within five days inside has acquired a quirky, redemptively sacrificial best friend (Zach Galifianakis) and a beautiful girlfriend (Emma Roberts) \u2013 who picturesquely cuts herself, although not in any way that spoils that lovely face. The reason for her self-harm finally remains unexplored. What a waste of time. The most enjoyable film at the festival might well be a revival \u2013 the painstaking digital restoration of David Lean&apos;s 1957 classic The Bridge on the River Kwai, which has the superb speech, courtesy of Sessue Hayakawa&apos;s Colonel Saito: &quot;I hate the British! You&apos;re defeated but you have no shame! You&apos;re stubborn but you have no pride! You endure but you have no courage!&quot; This film can now be appreciated not merely as a ripping, gripping yarn but as a satirical insight into the British experience of defeat, both in the war and the years after it. Saito is the second world war commander of the Japanese jungle work camp and in charge of extending the Bangkok-Rangoon rail link across the Kwai using a labour force of conquered and humiliated British POWs. He has demanded their officers do demeaning manual work alongside other ranks but Colonel Nicholson, incomparably played by Alec Guinness, has refused \u2013 despite being banged up in a furnace-like &quot;punishment hut&quot;. Exasperated by Nicholson&apos;s intransigence and stiff-upper-lip martyrdom, by the subsequent slow work on the bridge by his demoralised subordinates (which will get the Japanese commander into desperate trouble) and by his opposite number&apos;s refusal to accept that, in surrendering, the British have no rights to any human dignity at all, Saito finally gives in \u2013 and Nicholson&apos;s strange volte-face begins. Having secured the military principle of caste privilege, he is determined to show British superiority in engineering and administration. Nicholson throws himself with increasing passion into creating the best bridge these Japs have ever seen, unable to see how his masterpiece is an act of betrayal. Bridge-building gradually becomes a chilling symbol of collaboration with the enemy. William Holden plays Shears, the roguish American who escapes but is induced by Major Warden (played by Jack Hawkins) to join his commando expedition bidding to dynamite the bridge. Both Holden and Hawkins got superior billing, but this is Alec Guinness&apos;s film through and through: his thin, agonised face, as austere as a medieval saint&apos;s, burns out of the screen. The sweep and flair of this film are tremendous, and Lean creates an epic feel with terrifically photographed exterior locations. But with over 50 years&apos; insight we can also see how the director was offering a somewhat tactless, subversive satire. For years I have been hearing it glibly described as an &quot;anti-war film&apos;&apos; \u2013 which it is. But things are complicated than that. The career of Colonel Nicholson, somehow going the opposite of native in the relentless sun, is a cousin to Lean&apos;s TE Lawrence and also a reminder of an aspect of Britain&apos;s second world war history that tends to be passed over. Some fantasise about what would have happened if Britain had surrendered to Germany \u2013 the duke of Windsor installed as king? Mosley as prime minister? Our civil service induced to begin the painful, regrettable business of rounding up Jews? Unthinkable! However, Lean is reminding us that, despite our stirring Churchillian myths of never surrendering, in the far east the British did raise the white flag to an axis power. The Bridge on the River Kwai is a parable of P\u00e9tain-esque collaboration, demonstrating how we British might well salvage a bad situation by showing our masters we could make a triumphant job of submission and self-abasement. Perhaps Nicholson&apos;s awful situation spoke to Britain&apos;s sinking sense of defeat in the late 50s, with the nation progressively deprived of that empire which afforded his men their compromising chance to build bridges. The catchy Colonel Bogey march, whistled by the British POWs, may well have inspired Elmer Bernstein&apos;s theme for The Great Escape in 1963 \u2013 a much less challenging and disquieting film with a more palatable take on defiance. Guinness&apos;s final &quot;What have I done?&quot; as he staggers woozily up to the dynamite-plunger while the train chugs towards the river-crossing is the nailbiter to end all nailbiters. The Bridge on the River Kwai is a true classic: superbly conceived, photographed and acted, and a rich, narrative pleasure. It is a fitting addition to Britain&apos;s largest celebration of global cinematic achievement.", "publicationDate": "2010-10-21T16:37:14Z", "tags": ["London film festival 2010", "London film festival", "Film", "Culture", "Peter Mullan", "Neds"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/oct/21/peter-mullan-neds-london-festival", "title": "Peter Mullan's Neds heads London film festival's most-awaited list", "sentences": ["Saito is the second world war commander of the Japanese jungle work camp and in charge of extending the Bangkok-Rangoon rail link across the Kwai using a labour force of conquered and humiliated British POWs."]}, {"article": "This year, in the first flush of spring, a band that time forgot played the gig of their lives. &quot;It was so special, it was impossible to leave it behind, wasn&apos;t it? We had to keep picking at it, didn&apos;t we? It was like a scab.&quot; The once long-fringed frontman who led the band that launched Britpop \u2013 albeit against his will, Brett Anderson reminds us \u2013 sits in a hotel room on a darkening weekday evening, remarkably untouched by both time and excess, recalling Suede&apos;s performance at the Royal Albert Hall in March. Next to him, drummer Simon Gilbert and keyboardist Neil Codling are similarly Peter Pan-like; bassist Mat Osman is in New York; while Richard Oakes, the young pup who replaced guitarist Bernard Butler after writing to the band&apos;s fanclub, is in the\u00a0gents. &quot;He&apos;s hiding,&quot; says Anderson. &quot;He&apos;s terrified. Be gentle with him.&quot; In 2010, something remarkable has happened to Suede. Nearly 18 years after their debut album became the fastest-selling in British history, and seven years after they split not with a bang but with a whimper, they are, incredibly, the talk of the town. Next month, they release a carefully curated Best Of \u2013 Osman says on the phone, later, that Anderson has spent months labouring over it, making his own CDs to discover the best running order. In December, they play the O2, their biggest-ever non-festival show. This is all thanks to a gig they played for Teenage Cancer Trust back in March, preceded by two &quot;practice runs&quot; at London&apos;s 100 Club and the Manchester Ritz. At the Royal Albert Hall, they were a revelation: five men in their 30s and 40s playing at full throttle, as if the world was going to cave in once the curtains came down. When they played Metal Mickey, they received a standing ovation that went on for five minutes. Oakes finally enters the room as we discuss it, and smiles shyly when he realises what we are talking about. &quot;I thought someone had walked on stage, or something. It was genuinely unexpected.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s the one moment that I&apos;d relive for the rest of eternity,&quot; adds Anderson. &quot;And I did actually say on the night \u2013\u00a0here&apos;s your bold quote if you want it \u2013 I&apos;ve taken a lot of drugs in my life and nothing compares to it.&quot;     Anderson at Royal Albert Hall, London, in March 2010. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA    Everyone laughs. Suede know who the press expect Anderson to be: the easy-to-parody commuter-belt wordsmith, still in love with suburbs and skylines, nicotine and gasoline. The old dog still deploys flamboyant one-liners \u2013 when Gilbert&apos;s lost phone turns up in his pocket, for example, he says, &quot;Oh, come on, Simon, this isn&apos;t Arthur C Clarke&apos;s Mysterious World&quot; \u2013 but in 2010, Anderson is much more self-aware. He is, he says, &quot;much less interested in the persona of Brett Anderson&quot;, and even has a sense of humour about having a parodist on Twitter, something you couldn&apos;t have imagined 15 years ago. Since Suede broke up in 2003, all the members&apos; lives have changed hugely. As well as making three solo albums and reuniting briefly with Butler as the Tears, Anderson has married and gained a stepson &quot;who likes being read bedtime stories about pirates&quot;, and lost a father, who died in 2005. Gilbert moved to Bangkok as soon as the band split, and now drums for two bands called Futon and Goo (&quot;that&apos;s G-O-O&quot;); Codling became &quot;a keyboardist for hire&quot; for Natalie Imbruglia, among others; Osman became an editor of the online zine le cool; while Oakes has been working quietly on a new band, Artmagic, though he had not been on stage since Suede played their last note seven years ago. But then Teenage Cancer Trust came calling. At first, Anderson didn&apos;t know whether reforming would be wise. &quot;There were two conflicting voices,&quot; he says. &quot;One saying I&apos;d love to play those songs again, I&apos;m really proud of them. Another saying I should leave well alone.&quot; He spoke to Osman and Codling, called Gilbert on Skype, then spoke to Oakes \u2013 the least convinced party. Oakes stands out from his bandmates in other ways today: he wears a beige jacket and scruffy jeans while the others are stylish in black; he has a receding hairline; and he still looks acutely aware that he filled Butler&apos;s shoes, despite co-writing some of Suede&apos;s biggest hits. &quot;I was thinking, &apos;Oh God, can I do it, revisiting the past?&apos; All these emotions, I didn&apos;t think I could cope.&quot; Osman will also admit late that he had his doubts: &quot;Men in their 40s performing teenage songs \u2026 it could have easily gone horribly wrong.&quot; Anderson confirms there were lots of difficult conversations. &quot;But if it had been the wrong thing for one of us, it would have been the wrong thing for all of us. We kept persevering because we knew there was still something there.&quot; To decide once and for all whether a reunion would work, this version of Suede (Oakes joined in 1993, Codling in 1996), went to a tiny rehearsal room near Anderson&apos;s house. It was the first time they had played together for 10 years (Codling left the band in 2000 because he was suffering from ME). It was crucial there were no managers or roadies present, explains Anderson, so the five musicians could just drink tea and chat, and then hook up their instruments. They played Filmstar first, and it sounded amazing, he says. &quot;We also noticed a purity in those songs, because we&apos;d had distance from them,&quot; adds Codling. &quot;It also helped everyone remember,&quot; adds Anderson, &quot;why they were written in the first place.&quot; As the Albert Hall show approached, Osman remembers them discussing how important it was that they present the music free of frills: &quot;It had to be like five boys playing the Southampton Joiners Arms. To hide behind anything would have been cheating. We had to do the\u00a0opposite.&quot; Anderson felt they had a point to prove, too. &quot;I don&apos;t think there&apos;s ever been a point in Suede&apos;s career when we haven&apos;t. We&apos;ve always had our doubters. We&apos;ve always polarised opinion.&quot; He stops, then smiles. &quot;Although there&apos;s part of me that quite likes that, you know. I never wanted to be in someone&apos;s fifth-favourite band.&quot; Suede were born to be divisive: from early on, they were criticised for being the beneficiaries of media hype, even though they had spent years in various bands playing &quot;in front of three people&quot;. Later on, the fact that Anderson had been involved with Justine Frischmann, who became the frontwoman of Elastica and dated Blur&apos;s Damon Albarn, helped transform Britpop into a class-fuelled soap opera, with Blur cast as foppish class tourists, Suede as poor urchins looking at the stars and Frischmann a black-clad princess tearing them apart. Anderson doesn&apos;t think about the other Britpop bands now, he says, though he is still close friends with Frischmann, who now lives in LA; they had dinner together with their spouses last year, and he wishes he saw her more often. By 1994, as Oasis became more popular, it became clear that Suede didn&apos;t fit into Britpop any more, even though it was still a year before the scene&apos;s commercial apogee. Butler&apos;s departure also gave the critics extra fuel for the fire. &quot;They realised that a part of our armour was missing,&quot; recalls Anderson. &quot;That was the first time I realised that people often run in packs, and when they smell blood, they attack.&quot; Suede didn&apos;t want to run with a herd, though \u2013 and their second album, Dog Man Star, was deliberately anti-Britpop for that reason. &quot;We didn&apos;t want to wave union jack flags. And I didn&apos;t want to talk about my life any more, or include any references about living in London on the dole. It felt weird how they became Britpop references, really, and how quickly they got turned into beery cartoons.&quot; Anderson was also missing the departed Butler. &quot;He&apos;s an amazing musician, so I missed him in that sense. And the two first Suede albums were obviously very special.&quot; Butler has played a big role in putting together the Best Of, Anderson says. &quot;It was really nice: the two of us sitting together listening to Suede songs in the studio for the first time for nearly 20 years. A really lovely trip down memory lane.&quot; Anderson won&apos;t go into detail about their friendship, but thinks they made a good album together as the Tears, although they were naive not to realise how much the idea of their reconciliation being a de facto Suede reunion would overshadow it. Butler, though, will have no part of this reformation. Instead, Suede&apos;s current lineup is centred around their most commercially successful spell, one that gets overlooked because of the excitement of their early breakthrough. 1997&apos;s Coming Up produced five top 10 singles, and also made Suede famous in Europe and Asia. They all remember that time fondly, Gilbert says: &quot;It was make or break, but also really exciting. We were all waking up each morning not feeling any pressure.&quot; Things only went awry with 1999&apos;s Head Music. Codling was getting ill, and having to send ideas in by email; Anderson &quot;was off my head on buckets of drugs&quot;; Oakes, whose guitar parts were getting replaced by electronics, was &quot;switching off&quot;, he says. &quot;Which I really regret.&quot; By 2002&apos;s A New Morning, the band had grown apart, and Anderson was trying to tear Suede&apos;s sound into pieces \u2013 partly, he now realises, because he didn&apos;t want there to be a band any more. &quot;I think that we shouldn&apos;t have made that record, quite honestly.&quot; He persevered out of sheer bloody-mindedness \u2013 wanting to prove to the doubters, once again, that Suede hadn&apos;t been a flash in the pan. Instead, the band broke up amicably with a run of full-album gigs at London&apos;s ICA, which they nonetheless remember as quiet final flourishes. &quot;We didn&apos;t go out the way we had planned,&quot; Osman says. &quot;We should&apos;ve gone out in a blaze of fists in Bangladesh, or something.&quot; Quietness seems inimical to Suede: Anderson misses the danger and fierceness his band used to thrive on. &quot;I do find it weird that the last 10 years hasn&apos;t thrown up a new definitive genre. It seems that music is here to placate now, rather than provoke. Maybe a sense of apathy has crept in, or people&apos;s lives are too comfortable. No one wants to inspire extremity, as we used to do.&quot; Perhaps sticking around beyond the winter tour would help make this happen, I suggest. The room falls silent as the notion floats around. &quot;At the moment \u2026 we don&apos;t know,&quot; Anderson says finally, making it clear he is the ringmaster. &quot;I think we&apos;d have to be convinced that it would be the right thing to do. You know, has the moment passed, or should we pick at the scab again?&quot; Next year, after all, he releases another solo record, a big rock-inspired album \u2013 although its energy has, he admits, been fuelled by Suede&apos;s reunion. And everyone agrees that something has changed in all of them in the wake of the reunion. &quot;The fact it happened 20 years after the band formed \u2013 isn&apos;t that wonderful? Who&apos;s to say it couldn&apos;t happen again in the\u00a0future?&quot; Anderson raises his hands, and his cheekbones gleam in the evening light as it falls through the window. Everyone smiles, and understands. This isn&apos;t yesterday&apos;s man. The Best of Suede is released on Ministry of Sound on 1 November. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 October 2010 to correct the date of A New Morning.", "publicationDate": "2010-10-21T20:30:02Z", "tags": ["Suede", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "Britpop"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/21/suede-reunion-best-of", "title": "Suede brush up", "sentences": ["Gilbert moved to Bangkok as soon as the band split, and now drums for two bands called Futon and Goo (&quot;that&apos;s G-O-O&quot;); Codling became &quot;a keyboardist for hire&quot; for Natalie Imbruglia, among others; Osman became an editor of the online zine le cool; while Oakes has been working quietly on a new band, Artmagic, though he had not been on stage since Suede played their last note seven years ago."]}, {"article": "Our society is full of devils, and you find these devils in football.&quot; So said Sepp Blatter, head of football&apos;s world governing body, after two of his fellow members of the Fifa executive board were provisionally suspended for allegedly offering their votes for sale in the bidding process for the World Cup finals. There are devils in sport everywhere. World Cup bids from Europe and Asia are under scrutiny by Fifa after claims of vote-swapping. The latest issue of Sports Illustrated shows that another kind of football, the American college game, is troubled by illegal payments to players. There is corruption in sport all over the globe. The evidence of the past two weeks, however, strengthens the widely held view that African football is home to more of these devils than any other sport in any other part of the world. There are many exasperated players, coaches and officials throughout the continent who feel Fifa, far from doing all in their power to exorcise them, actually encourage them. While the votes-for-sale scandal has attracted headlines globally, other tales of corruption are arguably just as mind-boggling. A sensational case of match-fixing was revealed to a judge in a hearing in Zimbabwe last week, and multiple tales of bribes, bungs and bottomless pockets in eight countries are featured in a special report just published by the Forum for African Investigative Reporters (Fair). &quot;Nobody dares touch these looters [corrupt football executives] because of the Fifa policy of non-interference,&quot; one of Zimbabwe&apos;s top coaches tells Fair. &quot;The football community will never get to the bottom of the rot.&quot; He is referring to the strictly regulated policy of suspending national federations who are subject to &quot;government interference&quot;. In essence this may sound sensible, as corruption is rife in political life, too, but it gives the executives on national federations limitless power. No government wants to alienate its public by being held responsible for a country&apos;s banishment from world football. If they suspect corruption or mismanagement within football, they investigate under threat of expulsion from the world game. Thus the corruption festers. The match-fixing story emerged at a tribunal hearing in Harare. A club side, Monomatapa, made a brief tour of Asia in the guise of the Warriors, Zimbabwe&apos;s national XI, last December. Blatter&apos;s men are investigating, as two games are listed as full internationals. Criminal proceedings are likely to follow. A judge heard that two officials from Zifa \u2013 the chief executive, Henrietta Rushwaya, and the programmes officer, Jonathan Musavengana \u2013 acted without the sanction of the Zifa board and sent the club players out as Zimbabwe. On arrival in Bangkok the team were instructed to lose 1-0 to Thailand by &quot;an Asian gentleman&quot; according to evidence from a coach. This &quot;gentleman&quot;, named as Raja Raj, a Malaysian gambler, sat on the team bench during the game, talking to a fellow member of his gambling syndicate. He became increasingly agitated as the tourists, having travelled at short notice and being short of match practice, lost 3-0. After that match the Asians are said to have confronted players, claiming they were in the books of another betting syndicate. &quot;Raja Raj threatened our players for having cost him more than $1m [\u00a3640,000] by not losing according to instructions,&quot; the official Zifa report says. The coach, Joey Antipas, claims: &quot;In order for him to recover his money he [Raj] arranged two games.&quot; They were both in Malaysia: the first against a club side, the second against Syria, who are ranked a few places higher than Zimbabwe. &quot;The condition was to lose 6-0 [to Syria]. We disagreed but we were afraid because the guy wanted to recover his money. Jonathan Musavengana was directing operations from the bench while receiving calls from the Asian syndicate. Whenever he received a call, he would stand up from the bench and dish out instructions to concede goals, and that game was duly lost 6-0. &quot;At the airport the players were paid $1,000 each after they had met one member of the syndicate. A bunch of US dollars was also given to Musavengana as Zifa&apos;s share. To conclude, I would say my hands received dirty money due to being forced into these games of illegal betting by Jonathan Musavengana.&quot; One player was so disgusted by the fixing that he asked to be substituted. Another feared for his life, he said. The paper trail recording what happened, who picked the team, who sanctioned the trip and so on has been lost or destroyed, and the dates of emails have been doctored, according to investigators. Zifa are also investigating club matches under suspicion, as well as Zimbabwe&apos;s results in the Merdeka Cup, a tournament in Malaysia, in 2007. In their first 34 minutes in that competition, the Warriors conceded four goals. Rushwaya, who did not attend the tribunal, faces dismissal after being found guilty of a number of charges, among them securing a $103,000 loan without authorisation. The money cannot be traced. A further hearing is to be held into the match-fixing scam, and inquiries are ongoing into the missing $640,000 gate money from a pre-World Cup match between Zimbabwe and Brazil. A former Zifa president is also implicated. Zimbabwe is far from an isolated case. Missing money, flawed or nonexistent accounts, forged transfer and registration documents, and rigged elections feature throughout the Fair report. When the Nigerian president, Goodluck Jonathan, suspended the national team after their flop at the World Cup and ordered an audit into allegations of fraud, Fifa moved against him. They called for advice on the state of football governance in Nigeria from none other than Amos Adamu, the man at the centre of the World Cup votes scandal who has been provisionally suspended. Adamu had already been sacked as director general of Nigeria&apos;s National Sports Commission. He denies any wrongdoing in the &quot;votes for sale&quot; investigation. After taking advice from their own man, Fifa gave the Nigerian government three days to withdraw their decision or face a ban covering the men&apos;s and women&apos;s national teams, club sides in African competitions and Nigerian referees. Fifa would also withhold $8m due to Nigeria for participating in the World Cup. The politicians backed down. &quot;Our first interlocutors are naturally our members, that is the national association,&quot; a Fifa spokesman explains. &quot;However we receive information from different sources amongst football&apos;s stakeholders.&quot; In Zambia four FA executive members resigned in disgust at the reign of Kalusha Bwalya, a former African footballer of the year, then coach of the national team and now president of the FA. Bwalya is also an agent and is married to a marketing executive who worked for the 2010 World Cup organising committee. Allegations of corruption focus on the transfer of a young player to Israel, and nearly 100 clubs \u2013 including those backed by the police, army and air force \u2013 have signed a petition against what they now see as an unconstitutional ZFA. But Fifa are supporting Bwalya and say any objections will have to wait until the next ZFA elections in 2012. Fifa&apos;s &quot;stick to your statutes&quot; attitude has not been evident in the case of Kenya, where the last elections were in 2004. There should have been a new vote in 2008. It was action by disgruntled clubs that led to a breakaway league being formed in Kenya. It is now thriving, competitive and well-run, and brings in more than $1m a year in TV money, although there was a terrible incident yesterday in which seven fans were killed in a stampede before a match in Nairobi. Despite the success of the new league, however, the Kenyan Football Federation are still headed by people who have been accused of, and in two cases charged with, corruption. &quot;In many cases, &apos;government interference&apos; is because of gross mismanagement and/or corruption in the national football association,&quot; explains Bob Munro, vice-chairman of the Kenyan Professional League. &quot;But who suffers most when Fifa impose a ban? Sadly, it is the innocent clubs, coaches, players and referees. What judicial or other regulatory process in the world punishes the innocent victims?&quot; More than a dozen countries have been suspended in the past five years under Fifa&apos;s &quot;no interference&quot; rules, including Nigeria, Kenya, Chad, Madagascar and Ethiopia, with Togo (who were also involved in &quot;fake&quot; international matches) and Botswana under threat of suspension. Botswana could apparently be banned because the government has set up a youth football league which is not run by the national FA. In 2004, Fifa banned Kenya for &quot;government interference&quot;. In a case that is fully documented, it was shown that: officials repeatedly ignored or broke 12 of the 21 articles in the KFF constitution; they repeatedly failed to produce annual audited accounts for four years; they refused to allow member clubs to inspect the accounts; officials allegedly stole more than $700,000 from their own body&apos;s and Fifa&apos;s funds; Kenyan clubs sent detailed evidence, and wrote 30 letters and appeals to Fifa between 2002 and 2004 asking them to intervene, which Fifa ignored; the high court of Kenya confirmed in April 2004 that the KFF officials were no longer legally in office because they failed to hold elections; Fifa still insisted that the government must ignore the high court ruling and reinstate the KFF officials. &quot;How can Fifa demand that a sovereign government break its own constitution by ignoring a ruling of its highest court or be banned?&quot; asks an incredulous Munro. &quot;Would the British or American governments consider that a reasonable demand by Fifa?&quot; Munro explains how corruption works from the bottom level up. Elections for office in the national FA start at sub-branch level. In the last KFF elections, six years ago, the Thika sub-branch had nine registered clubs eligible to vote. An additional 70 ineligible clubs were allowed to vote. In Zimbabwe it appears to be simpler. Three Zifa councillors admitted to Fair that they were paid $2,000 for their votes in the last election for Zifa president. &quot;It was no big deal, because we were voting for the better of the two candidates anyway,&quot; one of them said. The African media is tainted, too, with examples cited in the Zimbabwe hearing and the Fair report of journalists taking payments, or asking for them. Fifa have a very difficult job governing more than 200 member federations. They deserve credit, says Munro, for implementing important reforms such as setting up the ethics code, launching new youth programmes and grassroots development projects in Africa. &quot;But further reforms are needed,&quot; he says, &quot;especially on ensuring good governance in Fifa&apos;s regional and national associations, on improving Fifa&apos;s relations and cooperation with governments, and on applying more effective sanctions and targeted bans which punish corrupt officials instead of innocent clubs, coaches, players and referees.&quot; The International Olympic Committee are way ahead in this respect, and this week officials from more than 200 nations will gather at a conference in Mexico to work out how to improve relations between sport and government. Fifa stand by their policy. A spokesman says: &quot;Fifa shares the goal of ridding football of corruption, and is willing to act, as demonstrated earlier this week. However allegations of false corruption are also often used by governments as an excuse to try to remove football officials from an association. They cannot remove football officials and put their friends at the top.&quot; Blatter ended that statement about &quot;devils in football&quot; by saying: &quot;We have to fight for fair play. Trust us and you will see confidence will be restored.&quot; Any questions, though, and you&apos;re suspended.", "publicationDate": "2010-10-24T08:00:04Z", "tags": ["Fifa", "Football politics", "Football", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/oct/24/corruption-african-football-fifa", "title": "Free-for-all and corruption in African football shames Fifa | Brian Oliver", "sentences": ["On arrival in Bangkok the team were instructed to lose 1-0 to Thailand by &quot;an Asian gentleman&quot; according to evidence from a coach."]}, {"article": "To be in South Korea as part of its hosting of the G20 summit which will be held on 11 and 12 November is to witness a piece of history. In the lifetime of South Korea&apos;s leaders, and in a triumph of development, the country has gone from having a GDP per capita lower than much of sub-Saharan Africa to being one of the world&apos;s largest economies, and is now a larger aid donor than some European countries. It didn&apos;t get here by following the &quot;guidance&quot; of the international financial institutions. Instead, South Korean growth came from redistributing wealth, managing market engagement and making massive public investment in human capital. Indeed, the success of east Asia, and the failure of the Washington Consensus, prompted me to ask the G20 representatives attending the recent High-Level Development Conference in South Korea earlier this month whether we should swap the Washington consensus for a Seoul consensus. The eclipsing of the G7/G8 by the G20 marks a change in the global political economy. It changes the culture of global meetings too. I&apos;m pretty sure, for example, that this is the first time a host government of such a meeting has had an official pop song.            But for those who had hoped that the expansion of the old colonial G8 into the more inclusive G20 would bring a greater focus on poverty, there will be some disappointment. The G20 do not want to discuss aid or debt for example, and it was a struggle to even get development on the agenda. Even with development now an official topic of discussion, I had one (western) government representative at the meetings confess: &quot;I don&apos;t know much about development, I&apos;m an economist.&quot; And though the chairman of the African Union is invited as an observer, the AU is still not a permanent, equal member of the forum. &quot;There has to be a balance between efficiency and inclusiveness,&quot; goes the mantra. Those who complained about the old G8 but made it into the G20 go along with this. All reminiscent of the natural human tendency that when you&apos;re waiting for a bus in the rain, you shout at the buses that keep driving past; but when you get into the bus, you join in with the others shouting to the driver that the bus is too full to keep stopping at all the stops to let rain-drenched passengers in. The civil society groups attending the meetings of Civil G20 have taken a different approach, with more than 100 participants from across the world. It is a wonderfully diverse group: in my first five minutes at a meeting I met an obstetrician, a teacher, a lawyer and a priest. But it is a hard group to organise. At times we got a little sidetracked. Discussing a civil society submission paper to the G20, someone asked another participant: &quot;Are you upset because of the comma?&quot; For those focused on global poverty, the most important issue being discussed at the G20 is the idea of an FTT, a financial transaction tax to help raise the money needed to fight poverty. It sounds wonkish, but at a rate of just 0.05%, and applied globally, this could raise between \u00a3256bn and \u00a3446bn annually, roughly four to seven times the current level of overseas aid. Among the G20 representatives, opinion is divided. A senior official from a major economy told a group of community activists from Asia, Latin America and Africa that while the idea of taxing irresponsible traders may seem attractive, in the end the costs would fall upon &quot;ordinary people like me and you&quot;. In the middle ground was the government representative who acknowledged that the FTT was a good idea but declared that it would be &quot;hard to do&quot;. (Can the world&apos;s &quot;premier economic forum&quot; not do hard things?) But a representative from another G20 country urged me: &quot;Please keep pushing on the financial transaction tax. We need you to do so. It&apos;s like with the landmines treaty. Governments said it couldn&apos;t be done. You in the NGOs kept pushing. And it happened. This can happen too. It will happen \u2013 if you keep pushing us.&quot; Civil society advocacy stands little chance when all governments are opposed to us \u2013 but when an issue is in contention, like this one, we can be the force that makes the difference, that pushes an issue beyond the tipping point. The world is short of more than 3.5 million health workers, and an FTT could help pay for them. For some of the more than 8 million children who die every year from preventable causes, that could mean life instead of death. An FTT won&apos;t be agreed this month or next month, but if we can keep it on the agenda, as the French start to organise for their chairing of the G20 in 2011, we can help to ensure that it does happen, and that we make another piece of history. \u2022 Ben Phillips is Save The Children&apos;s Asia strategy director.

The Prey Speu facility, 12 miles from Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, is officially described as a &quot;social affairs centre&quot; offering education and healthcare to vulnerable people. But human rights groups and former inmates say the centre is an illegal, clandestine prison, where people deemed &quot;undesirable&quot; by the government \u2013 usually drug users, sex workers and the homeless \u2013 are held for months without charge. Men, women and children are housed together in a single building and are regularly beaten with planks, whipped with wires or threatened with weapons, according to witnesses. It is alleged that guards have beaten three detainees to death and gang-rapes by the same body of men are reportedly common. The UN&apos;s own Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has described the conditions at Prey Speu as &quot;appalling&quot; with people &quot;illegally confined and subject to a variety of abuses of power by the staff that included sub-humane conditions of detention, extortion, beating, rape, sometimes resulting in death and suicide&quot;. But the department that runs Prey Speu still gets money directly from the UN&apos;s children&apos;s fund, Unicef and the centre is also supported by several international NGOs. Sok Chandara (not his real name) was picked up off the streets of the capital and taken to Prey Speu, &quot;they said because it looked bad for the city to have people sleeping on the streets&quot;. While police told him he was under arrest, he was never charged with an offence nor brought to court. He was held with more than 100 men, women and children in a bare room and allowed out for just an hour a day. Some inmates were violent and abusive while others were seriously ill or injured. Detainees were forced to go to the toilet in a bucket and medical care was irregular. Drinking water came from a fetid pond in which untreated sewage was emptied. Inmates were expected to bathe and wash their clothes in the same pond. &quot;It was like a hell. Many people were sick, people had diarrhoea, stomach aches because they were drinking dirty water, and there were no doctors,&quot; Sok said. Prey Speu has a daily food budget of 3,000 riels (47p) for each detainee. Generally, they are fed a watery rice gruel in a plastic bag twice a day. Violence was a daily occurrence, Sok said. A guard beat him with a plank when he intervened to stop the guard hitting another man. &quot;Sometimes, the guards just open the doors and come in and just beat people up, for no reason. They know no one can complain about the way they are being treated.&quot; According to the Cambodian human rights advocacy group LICADHO, three Prey Speu detainees have been beaten to death in front of other inmates. Another five detainees have killed themselves, including two women who had been separated from their children. Sok escaped by jumping over a wall and fleeing through rice paddies. He is still homeless, and fears being re-arrested and sent back. &quot;Only the people who are locked up there know how bad it is, how scary it is. It doesn&apos;t help people.&quot; The usual way out of Prey Speu is for detainees or their families to bribe the guards with sums from $50 to $200 (\u00a332 to \u00a3125). Visiting Prey Speu, the Guardian saw about 100 detainees being allowed out of the main building. There was no separation of men and women and most of the detainees were barefoot. At least 20 were children, some as young as four. Guards at three-metre gates said the facility was a voluntary welfare centre and detainees were free to leave whenever they wanted. Asked why the gates were padlocked, guards said it was to keep people out. Reports by Human Rights Watch  document numerous rapes by guards and police there. One sex worker told HRW she was raped by five police officers on her first night in detention, and by six officers the next evening. When she resisted, she was beaten. Elaine Pearson, HRW&apos;s Asia division deputy director, said the Cambodian government and donors had failed to act to close Prey Speu despite overwhelming evidence of abuse. &quot;For years, there have been credible reports of rape, beatings and even deaths in custody by guards at Prey Speu, but nothing has been done to hold these abusers to account.&quot; She said international funding for the ministry of social affairs must be withdrawn. The OHCHR still funds Cambodia&apos;s transcultural psychosocial organisation to conduct psychological assessments in the centre. Mental health workers find many inmates are severely depressed and some are suffering psychosis, the organisation&apos;s executive director, Dr Chhim Sotheara, said. In July, Unicef called a meeting of concerned parties where international donors outlined the support they were providing to Prey Speu. Richard Bridle, Unicef&apos;s country director for Cambodia, declined an interview with the Guardian. But in a statement Unicef said that it &quot;technically and financially supports the ministry of social affairs, veterans and youth rehabilitation (MoSAVY) and related institutions to regulate, oversee and monitor child welfare and ensure provision of social and child protection&quot;. Last year, Unicef gave \u00a3390,000 to the ministry of social affairs. When similar criticisms of the Choam Chao youth rehabilitation centre emerged this year, Unicef withdrew \u00a317,750 in funding and the centre immediately closed. But Unicef says no direct assistance is given to Prey Speu. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, spent two days in Cambodia this week. During a brief press conference in Bangkok in advance of the visit, the Guardian submitted a question to Ban about the UN&apos;s role in supporting the centres, but the request was rejected. Cambodia&apos;s ministry of social affairs has previously denied all allegations of abuse, saying that centres such as Prey Speu offer rehabilitation and vocational training. It defends its policy of &quot;street sweeps&quot; \u2013 removing beggars, the homeless and sex workers from the streets of the capital \u2013 saying they &quot;provoke public disorder and affect [the] dignity and morality of Cambodian society&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2010-10-28T17:38:15Z", "tags": ["Cambodia", "United Nations", "World news", "Human rights", "Law", "Rape and sexual assault", "Prostitution", "Children", "Homelessness", "Society", "Global development", "Housing", "Communities", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/28/raped-beaten-killed-cambodia-detention-camp", "title": "Cambodians beaten, raped and killed at illegal detention camp funded by UN", "sentences": ["During a brief press conference in Bangkok in advance of the visit, the Guardian submitted a question to Ban about the UN&apos;s role in supporting the centres, but the request was rejected."]}, {"article": "Bruno Philip Agencies Downpours that caused rivers to burst around Thailand have killed 94 people in nearly two weeks of flooding, which officials say is the worst in decades.

For six weeks I made my way through England, France, Spain, Morocco, Egypt, South Africa, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand and the US without carrying so much as a man-purse or a bum-bag. The few items I did bring (including a toothbrush, an iPod, and a few extra items of clothing) were tucked away in my pockets. Along the way I learned a thing or two about improvisation, hygiene, and what is and isn&apos;t necessary when travelling the world. When I announced my intention to circumnavigate the globe without luggage, the common (and admittedly reasonable) reaction from friends and family was: why? I usually answered that I&apos;d always liked to travel light, and that going without any bags at all sounded like a fun challenge. But beyond the stunt-like nature of the trip, I wanted to know how travelling ultra-light would affect my time on the road. At the heart of my whimsical journey was an experiment that would test out a more philosophical idea: that what we experience in life is more important than what we bring with us. In order to document this experiment, I travelled with a cameraman, my friend Justin Glow, who shot and edited three webisodes each week for my No Baggage Challenge blog. Justin brought a bag for his camera equipment and his stuff, though according to the rules I set up for the trip, I wasn&apos;t allowed to borrow any of his items, or store any of my items with him. These rules also stipulated that I couldn&apos;t mail things to myself along the route \u2013 though I could buy items along the way (such as a mineral-salt deodorant I picked up in Fez), and I could borrow items from locals or other travellers (an option I only used once \u2013 borrowing a sweater and stocking cap to keep warm in New Zealand). Naturally, my packing list had to be simple. In addition to the clothes on my back (cargo pants, boots, socks/underwear, T-shirt) I brought a toothbrush and a small tube of toothpaste, a small deodorant stick, two small bottles of concentrated liquid soap, sunglasses, a small tube of sunscreen, an iPod touch and foldable Bluetooth keyboard, a small digital camera, a small flashlight, a credit/cash card, and my passport. All of these items fitted, along with a change of socks, underwear, and T-shirt, into the inner pockets of a jacket/vest. All told, my total kit weighed less than two kilos. In the early days of my journey, when I left New York for London and made my way overland into France and Spain, my biggest challenges weren&apos;t logistical so much as psychological. It took me nearly a week to get past the nagging, instinctive fear that I had forgotten my bag someplace \u2013 and on more than one occasion I found myself looking around under bus seats or in my hotel room for luggage that did not exist. Since even my friends had insisted that my no-baggage strategy would leave me (and my clothing) smelling horrible after a few days, I immediately got into the habit of showering twice a day, and washing my clothes each night before I went to bed. For the first two days this felt like a slight hassle, but in time it became a part of my daily routine, as instinctive as brushing my teeth. The advantages of travelling without luggage became apparent on the first day of the journey, during a four-hour layover in London. Had I been carrying bags, I probably would have gone straight from Heathrow to St Pancras and waited for my Paris-bound train \u2013 but without luggage I was able to storm into the heart of London and get a three-hour taste of the city before moving on. Just over a week later, I ended up going to the wrong Moroccan city (I&apos;d mispronounced Chefchaouen to my taxi driver, and he took me to the town of T\u00e9touan) on the day Berber merchants had come in from the mountains to sell their wares. Without baggage, I was able to spontaneously explore the colourful medina for an entire afternoon \u2013 and still make it to Chefchaouen before sundown. By the time I left Morocco it was apparent that not having luggage wasn&apos;t going to add a lot of drama or complication to my day-to-day activities. Luggage \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 ceased to be much of an issue; I just threw myself into enjoying the adventure. In Egypt I had an elaborate shave with a cutthroat razor in a back-alley barbershop and explored the quirky tout-culture surrounding the pyramids at Giza; in South Africa I spotted lions, rhinos and giraffes in Kruger national park, and I sampled bush tea made from elephant poo in Welgevonden game reserve. In Bangkok I went out on the town and was tickled to find that I could get into some of that city&apos;s most exclusive nightclubs, in the clothes I&apos;d worn for 25 days in a row. In Thailand I discarded a few items I hadn&apos;t been using (camera, flashlight, one bottle of liquid soap), and continued on to Malaysia, Singapore and New Zealand even lighter than before. After six weeks on the road I arrived back in New York craving a little fashion variety \u2013 but for the most part my no-baggage challenge was less of a challenge than I&apos;d anticipated. Does this mean I&apos;ll spend the rest of my life travelling without bags? Probably not. Bags do serve a purpose: they make some aspects of a journey easier, and one can still travel ultra-light while carrying a small bag. In the end, then, my no-baggage experiment was less a test of extremes than a simple illustration of what you do and don&apos;t need on the road. All too often, I think, we pack a bunch of &quot;just in case&quot; items when packing for a journey (be it around the world or a weekend away), and most all of these &quot;just in case&quot; items are either available on the road, or not necessary in the first place. We also tend to pack unnecessary things because certain items feed into our psychic bubble of comfort \u2013 a kind of half-hearted attempt to bring home with us \u2013 when in fact not much is required, in the material sense, to enjoy a great time on the road. \u2022 Follow Rolf&apos;s luggage-free adventure at rtwblog.com", "publicationDate": "2010-11-06T00:05:08Z", "tags": ["Adventure travel", "Travel"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/nov/06/my-travels-rolf-potts-without-luggage", "title": "My travels: Rolf Potts goes round the world with no luggage", "sentences": ["In Bangkok I went out on the town and was tickled to find that I could get into some of that city&apos;s most exclusive nightclubs, in the clothes I&apos;d worn for 25 days in a row."]}, {"article": "     Independent Burmese observers have reported widespread allegations of voter intimidation and bribery in the country&apos;s first elections in a generation. The poll yesterday has already been written off by most international observers as a sham designed to entrench military rule, but further evidence of vote-rigging by the junta will only weaken its claims to have held a free and fair election. Several hundred observers from a politically neutral Burmese organisation, which cannot be named for security reasons, monitored preparations for the election and polling in districts across the country. They found widespread interference from the junta in the campaign and conduct of the elections, particularly in rural areas. The allegations emerged as at least 10,000 refugees fled across the border into Thailand to escape post-election fighting between government troops and ethnic Karen rebels. Sporadic clashes continued today along the border after rebels of the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army seized the police station and post office in the town of Myawaddy. Most of the DKBA sides with the regime, but a faction is fighting with other rebel groups against the central government. At least 10 people were wounded and thousands fled amid gunshots and mortar fire. The US, the UK, the EU and Japan have condemned the vote as neither free nor fair and repeated calls to free the opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Her youngest son, Kim Aris, flew from London to Bangkok last week ahead of her release, which is expected to come on 13 November, but the Burmese embassy denied his application for a visa. Speaking in Delhi, President Obama accused the junta of &quot;stealing the election.&quot; &quot;When peaceful democratic movements are suppressed - as in Burma - then the democracies of the world cannot remain silent. For it is unacceptable to gun down peaceful protestors and incarcerate political presoners decade after decade. It is unacceptable to hold the aspirations of an entire people hostage to the greed and paranoia of a bankrupt regime. It is unacceptable to steal an election as the regime has done again for all the world to see,&quot; he said. The Burmese observers&apos; accounts of the election are valuable as the junta banned all foreign journalists and monitors from the country ahead of the poll. A Japanese photographer, Toru Yamaji, 49, was detained in Myawaddy after slipping across the Thai border to try to cover the election. State TV said voters cast their ballots &quot;freely and happily&quot; but the observers said many were coerced into voting for the military junta&apos;s political arm, the Union Solidarity and Development party (USDP). Civil servants were told they would lose their jobs if they did not support the party while, in Rakhine state in western Burma, the owners of salt fields were told their land would be confiscated if they did not vote for the USDP. In other areas, villagers were warned all development programmes and public services would be cut if they did not vote for the government. Vote-buying was also reported: 30% of observers reported that cash or in-kind contributions were offered to people in exchange for government votes. In Karen state, a USDP candidate paid village leaders 200,000 kyats (about \u00a3125), and in Rakhine state, elderly people were given reading glasses and hospital patients 50,000 kyats by the government&apos;s candidate. Other villages were promised roads or street lighting in exchange for votes. At 13% of polling stations, observers said, voters faced intimidation or disturbance while voting. Several parties have lodged complaints with the electoral commission over advance voting, where the military collected votes from people in the days before the election. Polling stations were allegedly set up in government offices and at industrial zones where large numbers of voters could be signed up. In Keng Tung township in Shan state, all 200 advance votes were cast for the government party. In nearly two-thirds of polling stations, observers reported, advance votes were counted separately from regular votes. Concerns have been raised about votes being counted away from public or opposition party scrutiny. Meanwhile the arcane process of counting votes and declaring a winner was progressing slowly across Burma. It is likely to be days before a final result is known. There has been no official report on the number of votes cast on Sunday, but observers reported a poor turnout across the country, falling as low as 20% in some areas. In what is perhaps an indication of the emerging new government, several names from the military regime were among the first elected. Foreign minister U Nyan Win, forestry minister U Thein Aung and industry minister U Soe Thein are now civilian members of parliament. Forty-one of the 57 seats announced so far went to the junta&apos;s USDP, while the rest were shared by democratic parties, including several ethnic minority parties.", "publicationDate": "2010-11-08T13:11:00Z", "tags": ["Aung San Suu Kyi", "World news", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/08/burma-election-voter-intimidation", "title": "Burma election observers report voter intimidation", "sentences": ["Her youngest son, Kim Aris, flew from London to Bangkok last week ahead of her release, which is expected to come on 13 November, but the Burmese embassy denied his application for a visa."]}, {"article": "2004 February The 21-year-old Barton picks up the first red card of his career in Manchester City&apos;s FA Cup fourth-round tie at Tottenham Hotspur.

Inside the mildewing two-storey villa the Burmese junta has made her prison, the 65-year-old Buddhist meditates, sometimes for hours, before turning her attention to one of five radios, tuned to stations from around the world. These distant voices \u2013 broadcasts from the BBC, Voice of America, rebel news service Democratic Voice of Burma and others \u2013 are her only constant link with the outside world. She has no telephone, no TV and no internet. Her mail is heavily censored. Often it is not delivered. She spends her days reading, in Burmese and English, philosophy, biographies and novels. John le Carr\u00e9 and Georges Simenon are favourites. She was once a keen pianist, but Burma&apos;s muggy heat has warped the instrument. But Aung San Suu Kyi is not alone. She lives with two long-serving and loyal maids, mother and daughter Khin Khin Win and Win Ma Ma who, bizarrely, have been sentenced with their employer for this final stretch of house detention. She is allowed few visitors, those who come are strictly vetted and their visits closely monitored. A delivery man brings fresh food daily. Her family doctor pays a house call once a month. And another of the few who see her is her long-time lawyer and confidant, U Nyan Win, who has a standing fortnightly appointment. He brings her magazines, Time and Newsweek, every time he visits, &quot;because she must know about the news from around the world&quot;. &quot;She has a simple life in her home. But she can never leave. Not even to go outside into the gardens, to the compound. She is always inside. She is healthy, she exercises in her home. And she has strong spirit, she is determined.&quot; The once-grand lakeside home she inherited from her mother at 54 University Avenue looks every one of its 90-odd years. Despite some renovations this year, it is still in need of repair and painting. The electricity fails regularly. For days following Cyclone Nargis in 2008, she read by candlelight. And the villa&apos;s gardens, once immaculately kept, are now overrun by unruly vines. Fifteen years of imprisonment has robbed her of much. Her husband, British academic Michael Aris, died in 1999 of cancer. She could not visit him while he was dying without risking being exiled from her country forever, and the junta refused him an entry visa to Burma. She has not seen her two sons in more than a decade. She has never met her grandchildren. Every year her sons apply for visas, every year they are rejected without explanation. Until this week. In Bangkok yesterday, her youngest son, Kim was granted permission to enter the country. It is not known when he will come to Burma. &quot;It has been a hard life, she has sacrificed a lot. But she is used [to it] now. And she keeps working, waiting for the day she will be released,&quot; said her lawyer. For all of Burma, that day is expected as soon as Saturday which is when, according to U Nyan Win, her current sentence expires &quot;and there is no mechanism under Burmese law to extend that detention, to keep her under house arrest. They must let her go.&quot; There can be no guarantees from a junta that has detained Aung San Suu Kyi, essentially arbitrarily, three times in two decades, but hints from &quot;unnamed military sources&quot; suggest she will be released. &quot;I have not been told that she will be released, but it is my expectation,&quot; said U Nyan Win, wearing a bright blue longyi and sitting in a wicker chair in his concrete-floored law office in downtown Rangoon. He was interrupted by a constant stream of phone calls, with half a dozen mobiles across the office ringing for him. Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s final appeal against her sentence has just been rejected by the supreme court, and her legal team is assessing what it means for her liberty, and deciding their next move. For the most part, it appears the court&apos;s decision is a moot point. She has almost completed the sentence that she had appealed against: her incarceration was extended by 18 months for &quot;receiving&apos;&apos; American John Yettaw, who swam unannounced, and uninvited, across the lake that backs on to Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s home. The court, U Nyan Win was told, offered no reason for its decision, simply that the appeal had been rejected. He is less concerned with the court&apos;s ruling, entirely expected, than with what happens next, if and when she is freed. Since 1989, when she was first detained, Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s previous brief spells of freedom have always come with strict conditions from the military. Previously, she has been prohibited from leaving Rangoon, or forced to register with the army whenever she intends to go out of the city. But she has always railed against any restrictions. In 2000, she spent six days in her car at a military roadblock after being stopped from leaving Rangoon, the standoff only ending when she was put back under house arrest. Again, U Nyan Win said, she would not accept any conditions on her release this time. &quot;The lady will defy. She will not accept conditions from the regime. She must see her people, she is a politician, the people love to see her free, and she wants to meet with her people.&quot; U Nyan Win said Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s first act as a free woman would be to address the Burmese people and speak to the media, local and international. &quot;She will make a press conference, she needs to speak to the Burmese people but the world too. This is what she always does.&quot; She also wants to reinvigorate the National League for Democracy, the party she led to victory at the 1990 election but which has since been proscribed by the junta after advocating a boycott of last Sunday&apos;s poll. All of this is certain to raise the ire of the junta&apos;s ruling generals. On past form, theirs and hers, Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s liberty could be short-lived. &quot;She never thinks of that. She will do what she needs to do. For her people like before, like always.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-11-11T16:29:50Z", "tags": ["Aung San Suu Kyi", "World news", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/11/aung-san-suu-kyi-release", "title": "Aung San Suu Kyi may be about to go free, but for how long?", "sentences": ["In Bangkok yesterday, her youngest son, Kim was granted permission to enter the country."]}, {"article": "Apichatpong Weerasethakul has been asked to explain himself a lot in recent months. One reason is\u00a0that his new film, Uncle\u00a0Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, won the Palme D&apos;Or at the Cannes film festival this May, surprising most of the world&apos;s critics; the other is that it&apos;s about the least straightforward movie to have done so in living memory \u2013 an episodic, non-linear, open-ended head-scratcher. So for the past year, touring the world&apos;s film festivals \u2013 Toronto, Chicago, Rio de Janeiro, New York, Sitges, and, most recently, London \u2013 Thailand&apos;s auteur of the moment has been in a Groundhog Day of perplexed questioning. Why is your film so slow? Why the sex scene between the princess and the catfish? Is the runaway buffalo really Uncle Boonmee? Is the cave a metaphor, or just a cave? Do you believe in reincarnation? What the hell does it all mean, Mr Weerasethakul? &quot;But that&apos;s life, no?&quot; says Weerasethakul. He is a delicate, softly spoken man. &quot;Sometimes you don&apos;t need to understand everything to appreciate a certain beauty. And I think the film operates in the same way. It&apos;s like tapping into someone&apos;s mind. The thinking pattern\u00a0is quite random, jumping here and\u00a0there like a monkey.&quot; Weerasethakul possesses an aura of gentle, zen-like calm that&apos;s all of a piece his films. Far from being a showy, cryptic mind-melter, Uncle Boonmee is a hypnotic, sensual, rapturous dream of a movie. It doesn&apos;t so much confront western notions of reality as casually disregard them. Boundaries dissolve between the living and the dead, the past\u00a0and the present, man and nature, the\u00a0strange and the everyday. Before you\u00a0know it, it becomes perfectly natural to see\u00a0Uncle Boonmee chatting on the verandah with the ghost of his wife and their long-lost son, who turns up looking like Chewbacca with glowing red eyes \u2013 the result of having mated with a &quot;monkey spirit&quot;. &quot;Why did you grow hair so long?&quot;\u00a0his translucent mother asks him matter of\u00a0factly. Weerasethakul prefers not to explain anything about the film. &quot;This is open cinema,&quot; he says. &quot;I have my own take, but\u00a0sometimes that spoils the audience&apos;s imagination. I can say, in short, it&apos;s a movie about a dying man. It talks about death and at the same time life and dreams, and also the memory of how I grew up with this landscape.&quot; The landscape in question is northeast Thailand, close to where Weerasethakul grew up. In 2008, he was commissioned by\u00a0the cutting-edge London-based animation outfit Animate to create a multimedia project called Primitive, which centred on a village called Nabua. This peaceful place was once the centre of violent clashes between government forces and communist forces. Uncle Boonmee was an offshoot of Primitive, partly inspired by a book he chanced upon\u00a0about a real-life man who really did claim to be able to recall his past lives. But\u00a0other memories are folded into the story: Weerasethakul&apos;s own father, who\u00a0died of kidney failure; the area&apos;s violent history; the ape creature and the\u00a0stylised jungle settings that hark back\u00a0to\u00a0Thai movies and comic books of\u00a0his\u00a0childhood \u2013 elements of a rapidly disappearing landscape. &quot;I want to treasure them and say goodbye to them,\u00a0because they are dying, like Uncle\u00a0Boonmee.&quot; The collision between spirituality and\u00a0modernity in his films is easy to find in today&apos;s Thailand, says Weerasethakul. He\u00a0cites the street protests that gripped Bangkok earlier this year. Crowds were campaigning for modern democratic reforms, but one of their actions was to draw their own blood, mix it together and\u00a0daub the ministers&apos; gates with it. &quot;This kind of very primitive, animist belief is still ingrained in daily life. When we shoot a film, we make a ritual offering of\u00a0food to Ganetra, the god of arts. Everybody does it. &quot;Also, when people in the film industry feel they&apos;re having bad luck, they make offerings of black-coloured food to the god\u00a0of darkness, because we associate darkness with cinema. But at the same time, you see new Tescos springing up everywhere.&quot; Weerasethakul has had his own run-ins with the Thai authorities over the years. The homosexual content of his work seems to be acceptable, but in 2007 the censorship board demanded he remove scenes from his movie Syndromes and a Century depicting doctors drinking and kissing, and Buddhist monks playing with\u00a0a remote-controlled UFO. Weerasethakul refused, and instead jointly founded the Free Thai Cinema movement, which called for greater artistic freedom. In one interview, a culture ministry official responded: &quot;Nobody goes to see films by Apichatpong. Thai people want to see comedy. We\u00a0like a laugh.&quot; But the campaign appears to have had some impact. In Uncle Boonmee, a monk changes out of his robes to go to a karaoke bar, but the film has had no problems with\u00a0the censors. &quot;That&apos;s the magic of Cannes,&quot; Weerasethakul says. &quot;When I won, it was a very dark time for Thailand, so good news like this was embraced. It became a diversion for people emotionally, but also for the government.&quot; Contrary to the minister&apos;s put-downs, the\u00a0film was a commercial success, and is the country&apos;s official submission for this year&apos;s best foreign film Oscar. It would be a mistake to cordon off Weerasethakul in the ghetto of &quot;world cinema&quot;, though. For\u00a0one thing, he learned film-making in the US. The son of two doctors, he first studied architecture in Thailand as a\u00a0fallback position, but while\u00a0doing a masters at the School of the Art Institute of\u00a0Chicago, he became absorbed by the avant-garde work of Andy\u00a0Warhol, Bruce Baillie, Maya Deren and the like. There was no going back. &quot;After that, I said to myself, &apos;OK, I want to make films in black and white, on 16mm, for the rest of my life,&apos;&quot; he laughs. &quot;It&apos;s a shame that when I went back to Thailand, there were no laboratories to print 16mm\u00a0film.&quot; From then on, technological issues aside, Weerasethakul&apos;s career has seen a sure, steady ascent up the international scale. Both his feature debut, Blissfully Yours, and its followup, Tropical Malady, also won awards at Cannes. His next project involves his heroine, Tilda Swinton.\u00a0It concerns the Mekong river, he\u00a0explains, and will address the relationship between man and water, the catastrophic flooding which is blamed on Chinese dams and diseases spread by industrial-scale pig\u00a0farming. None of which particularly brings to mind Tilda Swinton. &quot;It&apos;s definitely not going to be a film that will just have a foreign movie star for the sake\u00a0of it. It&apos;s going to be an exchange of ideas, of images, of \u2026 I don&apos;t know. It&apos;s like\u00a0a game for me: the river, the pigs, and Tilda Swinton.&quot; He laughs at how absurd it sounds when he says it, but it&apos;s less crazy than princesses having sex with catfish. Not everyone adores Weerasethakul&apos;s jumping-monkey logic. Alongside the critical adulation, his films are frequently accused of being wilfully confusing, impenetrable, pointless and boring \u2013 one critic renamed Uncle Boonmee &quot;Uncle bong hit&quot;. Weerasethakul isn&apos;t bothered in the slightest: &quot;I always say a film should have a personality. And like a person, if he or she is very popular, I would feel very suspicious. Maybe my good film is not your good film. It&apos;s very subjective. But if I make a film that divides the audience, I feel like that&apos;s a certain level of success. Film should divide people. &quot; The danger with Weerasethakul is that the public stays on the other side of the divide to the adoring critics. Uncle Boonmee is unlikely to give Harry Potter a run for its money at the UK box office, but in broader terms, it&apos;s about time someone shook things up. Even Godard&apos;s dictum that a film should have a beginning,\u00a0a middle and an end, &quot;but not necessarily in that order&quot; is now half a century old. With Weerasethakul&apos;s boundary-dissolving films, the very idea\u00a0of narrative beginnings and ends becomes redundant. It&apos;s not spoiling a great deal to disclose that Uncle Boonmee ends with two sets of the same characters in one room \u2013 as if parallel universes have accidentally collided, or time has split into two. Furthermore, these are characters who have appeared in his previous films \u2013 a self-referential flourish that casts a different light on his other works. Like any\u00a0good avant-garde film-maker, he&apos;s ignoring the rules and finding new possibilities \u2013 and in years to come, his methods will doubtless be absorbed by the mainstream, and future generations wonder how we failed to understand what he was doing. &quot;For me, film-making is still young,&quot; he says. &quot;It still has room to grow, and now it&apos;s still\u00a0attached to other kinds of art, like literature, or theatre. I&apos;m not saying I&apos;m trying to create some revolutionary style, but each film has its\u00a0own language \u2013 the movie\u00a0tells you how it wants\u00a0to be\u00a0told. But we tend to stick to very few modes of\u00a0expression.&quot; Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives is out next week", "publicationDate": "2010-11-11T21:29:01Z", "tags": ["Apichatpong Weerasethakul", "World cinema", "Film", "Culture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/11/apichatpong-weerasethakul-director-uncle-boonmee-interview", "title": "'You don't have to understand everything': Apichatpong Weerasethakul", "sentences": ["He\u00a0cites the street protests that gripped Bangkok earlier this year."]}, {"article": " 9.55am: Good morning, hundreds of supporters of Burma&apos;s long-detained pro-democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, have gathered outside her house for a second day, ahead of her expected release. Her latest term of house arrest officially ends today, and there has been a flurry of reported activity near her Rangoon home and a series of reports saying Burma&apos;s military rulers have sanctioned her freedom. In his latest report for the Guardian, Jack Davies reports that Aung San Suu Kyi yesterday chose one last night of imprisonment so that she might walk truly free. He said the 65-year-old was told mid-afternoon Burma time yesterday that she was free to leave the two-storey lakeside villa which the junta had made her prison for most of this decade. However, attached to her release, the military sought to impose strict conditions, understood to be restrictions on where she could travel within Burma, and with whom she could meet. He writes: &quot;It was rumoured that Aung San Suu Kyi, Burma&apos;s best-known democracy advocate and a Nobel peace laureate, demanded an unconditional release and insisted on negotiating her unfettered freedom with military officials before she would set foot outside her door.&quot; Today there has so far been no formal statement from Burma&apos;s ruling generals on Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s release, but her lawyer Nyan Win told reporters earlier today: &quot;Nothing has happened so far, but her house arrest expires today.&quot; To remind you all: Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s National League for Democracy (NLD) won a landslide victory in elections in 1990 which were promptly ignored by the junta. She has subsequently been detained for 15 of the last 21 years. The first elections since then took place on Sunday but were widely labelled a sham by outside observers. The NLD refused to take part and has now been ordered by the military to disband. The junta-dominated Union Solidarity and Development party looks set to take almost all the seats in both houses of parliament. Among the new MPs is Thein Sein, the current prime minister, who stepped down from the military to stand.  10.07am: There are unconfirmed reports on Twitter of further activity at Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s house. Poster BURMA2010 writes: &quot;Something brewing. NLD believes visitors to be allowed into the compound within the next hour. First the doctor, NLD CEC and then diplomats.&quot; While we&apos;re awaiting further news, you can have a look through a gallery of the pro-democracy leader&apos;s life and another showing private photographs of her as a young bride-to-be, mother and housewife that belonged to her late husband, Michael Aris. There&apos;s also a timeline and a profile of her, which describes how she has become &quot;an icon, a universal symbol of courage, endurance and peaceful resistance, a new Mandela.&quot;  10.43am: Three car officials have entered the compound where she is under house arrest, AP reports. Reuters reports there are around 1,000 people gathered near the pro-democracy leader&apos;s home, many chanting &quot;Release Aung San Suu Kyi&quot; and &quot;Long live Aung San Suu Kyi&quot;. A government source told the news agency she would likely be released late in the day, but the comment could not be officially confirmed.  Reuters suggests that freeing Aung San Suu Kyi could be a bid by the ruling junta to seek some international legitimacy.  Such a move would be the first step towards a review of Western sanctions on the resource-rich country, the largest in mainland Southeast Asia and labelled by rights groups as one of the world&apos;s most corrupt and oppressive.Freeing the charismatic 65-year-old leader could also divert some attention from an election widely dismissed as a sham to cement military power under a facade of democracy.&quot;The regime needs to create some breathing space urgently,&quot; said a retired Burmese academic, who asked not to be identified.&quot;They may do that by releasing her and might think it will help improve an image tarnished by electoral fraud.&quot;   10.53am: The AFP news agency says there are unconfirmed reports that Aung San Suu Kyi has been released. AP says government officials have read a release order to her. PA reports that barricades outside her house have been removed. The BBC&apos;s Adam Mynott says the riot police have left and hundreds of people have surged forward outside the gates. He says there are reports that the pro-democracy leader will adress the crowd later today. Here&apos;s a gallery of scenes around Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s home today.  11.09am: Aung San Suu Kyi has finally been released. The BBC&apos;s Adam Mynott says she is standing on a box outside her house, waving at the crowd, trying to quieten them so she can speak. You can listen to his report here. Amnesty International secretary general Salil Shetty said: &quot;While Daw Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s release is certainly welcome, it only marks the end of an unfair sentence that was illegally extended, and is by no means a concession on the part of the authorities. &quot;The fact remains that authorities should never have arrested her or the many other prisoners of conscience in Burma in the first place, locking them out of the political process.&quot; He said it was now important the authorities ensured her security and &quot;put an end to the ongoing injustice of political imprisonment in the country&quot;.  11.24am: The BBC reports that Aung San Suu Kyi has briefly adressed the crowd. She said:   &quot;There is a time to be quiet and a time to talk. People must work in unison. Only then can we achieve our goal.&quot;  She has now gone back inside her house. It is unclear what her movements will be for the rest of the day, but she will speak at greater length tomorrow at midday local time outside the NLD&apos;s headquarters.  11.28am: David Cameron has said the pro-democracy leader&apos;s detention was &quot;a travesty&quot; and her release long overdue. The prime minister added: &quot;Aung San Suu Kyi is an inspiration for all of us who believe in freedom of speech, democracy and human rights.&quot;  11.36am: Zoya Phan, international co-ordinator at Burma Campaign UK, has described Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s release as a public relations exercise by the military junta, which should not be mistaken for a step towards democratic reform. She said: &quot;I am thrilled to see our democracy leader free at last, but the release is not part of any political process, instead it is designed to get positive publicity for the dictatorship after the blatant rigging of elections on November 7. &quot;We must not forget the thousands of other political prisoners still suffering in Burma&apos;s jails.&quot;  There are more than 2,200 political prisoners in Burma held under vague laws frequently used to criminalise peaceful political dissent, according to human rights campaigners.  11.38am: Former prime minister Gordon Brown said: &quot;There will be joy round the world at the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, the world&apos;s most renowned and courageous prisoner of conscience. &quot;Her release proves that no injustice can last forever, and while Burma&apos;s junta can continue its policy of repression it has never been able to wholly silence her voice. &quot;Despite enduring two decades of separation, her family has displayed great strength which has proved an inspiration to us all.&quot; Labour&apos;s shadow foreign secretary Yvette Cooper said: &quot;For Aung San Suu Kyi to be able to speak as a free woman for the first time in eight years is fantastic news. &quot;Aung San Suu Kyi is the symbol of the hope of Burma&apos;s people which has survived against the odds under a brutal and corrupt military regime. &quot;This is a significant step, but I hope only the first step. The world must keep up the campaign to support Aung San Suu Kyi and for the release of thousands of other political prisoners in a journey towards a free and democratic Burma.&quot;  11.53am: Aung San Suu Kyi has spoken on the phone to the younger of her two sons Kim, the BBC reports. The 33-year-old, who still lives in the UK and has not seen his mother in 10 years, said he was a very happy man and that she told him she hoped to see him soon. He is currently in Bangkok, Thailand, having failed to get a visa to Burma. Reuters reports that she is preparing to hold her first meeting with senior members of the National League for Democracy (NLD) later today.  12.00pm: The foreign secretary, William Hague, has welcomed Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s release and called on the military junta to allow her to move and work freely. &quot;She must now be allowed to assume a role of her choosing in the political life of her country without further hindrance or restriction. &quot;Last week&apos;s sham elections will not bring peace and prosperity to Burma. The regime now needs to release the other 2,100 political prisoners and begin a genuine dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and all opposition and ethnic groups. &quot;These remain the crucial first steps to solving Burma&apos;s many problems and addressing the pressing needs of its people.&quot;  12.20pm: US president Barack Obama has welcomed Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s release and described her as a hero. &quot;She is a hero of mine and a source of inspiration for all who work to advance basic human rights in Burma and around the world,&quot; he said. &quot;Whether Aung San Suu Kyi is living in the prison of her house, or the prison of her country, does not change the fact that she, and the political opposition she represents, has been systematically silenced, incarcerated, and deprived of any opportunity to engage in political processes.&quot;  12.31pm: Archbishop Desmond Tutu said the pro-democracy leader&apos;s release offered hope to the people of Burma and lauded her as &quot;a global symbol of moral courage&quot;. French President Nicolas Sarkozy warned the military junta against &quot;any restrictions on the freedom of movement and expression&quot; of the Nobel laureatte. Any new restrictions on her would &quot;constitute a new unacceptable denial of her rights&quot;, he said.  1.08pm: Fellow Nobel laureates, gathered in Hiroshima, Japan, for a three-day meeting to campaign against nuclear weapons, have welcomed Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s release. Former South African President Frederik Willem de Klerk and Hiroshima Mayor Tadatoshi Akiba gave a joint toast in her honor. &quot;I sincerely hope next year when we have the conference she will attend,&quot; said de Klerk, who won the Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela in 1993 for his efforts to end apartheid. &quot;For years we have been asking at the laureate conference for her release,&quot; he said. &quot;We welcome it, and we hope it will last, and there won&apos;t be a regression of any nature.&quot; Shirin Ebadi, one of Iran&apos;s first female judges and the 2003 Peace Prize winner, reacted with a simple &quot;Bravo.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s a victory over wrong,&quot; she said. &quot;Like the past, I hope she can act for democracy.&quot;  1.12pm: The Guardian&apos;s Jack Davies, who is in Rangoon, has sent through his account of the scenes outside Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s house.  &quot;University Avenue, the street on which Aung San Suu Kyi lives, and which has been blocked off for seven years, has been transformed into part-party part-vigil as thousands have flocked to the democracy icon&apos;s gate. &quot;People are openly weeping at the news she has been released, cars are beeping horns, and people are dancing, while others are sitting at her bamboo fence, singing and chanting Good health Aung San Suu Kyi. &quot;Thousands of people have appeared, just today, in t-shirts bearing &apos;The Lady&apos;s&apos; likeness, and the words, &apos;We stand with Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;. It&apos;s a t-shirt that would have landed people in jail a few weeks ago. &quot;The police, usually feared as the frontline of Burma&apos;s brutal security apparatus, have come in for huge amounts of ridicule and ironic cheers, two armed platoons, dressed in riot gear and carrying shotguns, stood at attention across the road most of the afternoon. When they were finally given the order to leave, they were jeered all the way down the street.&quot;  You can watch a BBC video of the moments after her release here.  2.33pm: Jack Davies has just sent through an update from Rangoon:  &quot;Rangoon is a city of palpable excitement tonight, across the city people are out, sitting in the tea-shops which are the social hub of Burmese life, discussing Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s release. This was a day of enormous anticipation, which, threatened to fall in to huge disappointment when, by late afternoon, her release had still not materialised. People are overjoyed at the release of their democracy icon. &quot;Usually, politics is the last topic of conversation Burmese people will enter into. Government spies are everywhere, and it is simply not safe. But tonight, everybody in Rangoon is talking about Aung San Suu Kyi, her release, and what it means for their country. This has excited the Burmese people in a way the recent general election did not. &quot;Police remain on standby throughout the city, but there is no mood for protest, just of excitement. &quot;There are no details known yet on what, if any, conditions have been imposed on her, but it is expected the government will attempt to impose some. During her previous brief spells at liberty, the military restricted where she could go (including confining her to Rangoon) and with whom she could meet. Every time, she has railed against and defied the government&apos;s restrictions, and there is every reason to believe she will do the same again this time.&quot;   3.59pm: In a rare mention of the opposition leader, Burma state television tonight reported that national police chief Major General Khin Yee visited Aung San Suu Kyi at 5pm (local time) to read the official release order. Khin Yee said he was happy to see her in good health, and that the authorities were ready to provide any assistance she needs, the report said. The police chief told her that the authorities wanted to maintain the rule of law, peace, stability and tranquility, and the pro-democracy leader replied &quot;she feels the same way, too,&quot; it added.  4.21pm: We&apos;re closing the liveblog now but there will be more coverage in tomorrow&apos;s Observer and on the website.  Here&apos;s a recap of today&apos;s events: \u2022 Aung San Suu Kyi, Burma&apos;s pro-democracy leader, has been released from her latest period of house arrest after seven years. \u2022 She told thousands of jubilant supporters gathered outside the compound where she has been confined that &quot;if we work in unity, we will achieve our goal&quot;. \u2022 She is due to speak at greater length tomorrow at the headquarters of her party, the National League for Democracy. \u2022 It is not yet known whether the military junta has imposed any conditions on her release. \u2022 World leaders, including US President Barack Obama and British prime minister David Cameron, have welcomed her release and urged the regime not to impose any further restrictions on her. \u2022 This article was amended on 16 November 2010. The original said: &quot;David Cameron has said the pro-democracy leader&apos;s release was &apos;a travesty&apos; and long overdue.&quot; This has been corrected.", "publicationDate": "2010-11-13T10:04:48Z", "tags": ["Aung San Suu Kyi", "World news", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/13/aung-san-suu-kyi-burma", "title": "Aung San Suu Kyi release: live coverage", "sentences": ["He is currently in Bangkok, Thailand, having failed to get a visa to Burma."]}, {"article": "   Burma\u2019s pro-democracy leader and Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi talks to the supporters as she stands at the gate of her home in Rangoon. Photograph: Khin Maung Win/AP    Aung San Suu Kyi, the international symbol of peaceful resistance in the face of oppression, walked to freedom today after the military regime in Burma released her from house arrest. The defiant and dignified Aung San Suu Kyi, who is known among her supporters as &quot;The Lady&quot;, appeared in front of a weeping and cheering crowd who had rushed to her house in Rangoon after the government barricades were swept away. Jubilation was tempered, however, by the reality that Burma is still in the grip of the generals who have run the country since overthrowing the democratically elected government more than 20 years ago and who cemented their hold last week in an orchestrated election. Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel peace prize in 1991, acknowledged the crowds and urged them to work together. &quot;I am so glad to see so many people here and so happy to be free,&quot; she said, standing on a stool and looking over the gate of the house where she had been confined for 15 of the last 21 years. &quot;There is a time to be quiet and a time to talk. People must work in unison. Only then can we achieve our goal.&quot; After just 10 minutes outside, she returned to the home that is no longer her prison. Thousands of her supporters, many wearing T-shirts bearing her image alongside the words &quot;We stand by Aung San Suu Kyi&quot;, stayed outside for several hours. Aung San Suu Kyi emerged later, thanking her supporters, but urging them to go home to sleep. While her term of detention has technically finished, it was not immediately clear how long that respite would last. During previous brief spells of freedom she has railed against, and defied, the conditions restricting where she could go \u2013 banning her from leaving Rangoon, for instance \u2013 and who she could meet. The government says that this time her freedom will not be restricted. &quot;She is completely free \u2013 there are no conditions at all,&quot; an unnamed senior government official was quoted as saying. But Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s supporters fear her freedom may again be short-lived, and that the generals will seek to rearrest her on some technical infringement. A defiant Aung San Suu Kyi, meanwhile, clearly intends to reimpose her leadership on Burma&apos;s splintered National League for Democracy (NLD). She promised to reveal her plans tomorrow at the headquarters of the NLD, a sign to the regime that she intends to fight on for democracy. Her release was welcomed around the world, not least by her late husband&apos;s family in Britain. It is understood that she was able to speak on the phone to her youngest son, Kim, who is currently in Bangkok. She has not seen her two sons for 10 years, and Kim this week failed again in his attempt to get a visa to travel to Burma. He has two children whom Aung San Suu Kyi has never met. Today was a &quot;happy day&quot;, said Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s British brother-in-law, Adrian Phillips. &quot;We are obviously very pleased if it means we can contact her again after so many years of silence,&quot; Phillips said. &quot;The last time I spoke to her was when her husband [Michael Aris] died in 1999. There are all sorts of family matters that we haven&apos;t been able to talk to her about. She has a granddaughter, Jasmine, who she has never seen.&quot; In the UK, David Cameron said Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s release had been long overdue. The prime minister added: &quot;Aung San Suu Kyi is an inspiration for all of us who believe in freedom of speech, democracy and human rights.&quot; William Hague, the foreign secretary, said: &quot;Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s arbitrary detention for most of the past 20 years has been deeply unjust. Her fortitude in the face of this outrage has been inspirational. &quot;She must now be allowed to assume a role of her choosing in the political life of her country without further hindrance or restriction. &quot;Last week&apos;s sham elections will not bring peace and prosperity to Burma. The regime now needs to release the other 2,100 political prisoners and begin a genuine dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and all opposition and ethnic groups. These remain the crucial first steps to solving Burma&apos;s many problems and addressing the pressing needs of its\u00a0people.&quot; Gordon Brown, the former prime minister, said: &quot;There will be joy round the world at the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, the world&apos;s most renowned and courageous prisoner of conscience.&quot; President Barack Obama described the woman who has spent most of the past two decades almost cut off from the world, as a hero. &quot;She is a hero of mine and a source of inspiration for all who work to advance basic human rights in Burma and around the world,&quot; he said Fellow Nobel laureates, meeting in Hiroshima, Japan, to campaign against nuclear weapons, welcomed her release. &quot;For years we have been asking\u2026 for her release,&quot; FW de Klerk, the former president of South Africa, said. &quot;We welcome it, and we hope it will last, and there won&apos;t be a regression of any nature.&quot; Burmese state media last night attributed Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s release to good conduct. &quot;Aung San Suu Kyi behaved well according to the regulations during the period she was under a suspended sentence, so she was allowed to be released,&quot; government-run TV reported. The report noted that Aung San Suu Kyi was &quot;the daughter of the leader General Aung San who gave his life for Myanmar&apos;s [Burma&apos;s] independence&quot;. It also expressed a desire &quot;not to hold a grudge against each other&quot;. Aung San Suu Kyi was first imprisoned by Burma&apos;s military regime in June 1989. Since then, she has spent more than 15 years in secret detention, jail and under house arrest. Her latest period of incarceration, her third, began in 2003. This final stretch of imprisonment was an 18-month sentence for having &quot;received&quot; an unauthorised visitor when an eccentric well-wisher, American John Yettaw, swam across a lake to her house in the middle of the night.", "publicationDate": "2010-11-13T18:00:05Z", "tags": ["Aung San Suu Kyi", "World news", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/13/burma-aung-san-suu-kyi-released", "title": "Aung San Suu Kyi release brings joy, tears \u2013 and new hope for Burma", "sentences": ["It is understood that she was able to speak on the phone to her youngest son, Kim, who is currently in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "1 Eat Tweet: Maureen Evans (Artisan, \u00a312.99) The anti-cookbook cookbook.

Speaking at length publicly for the first time since she was detained in 2003, Burma&apos;s revered face of democracy said she would like to &quot;speak directly and honestly&quot; with the generals who jailed her. But she called too for the release of the more than 2,100 political prisoners still being held by the Burmese regime. &quot;I think we all have to work together,&quot; she said. &quot;We will have to find a way of helping each other.&quot; More than 10,000 people jammed Shwegondine Road in central Rangoon yesterday to catch their first glimpse of &quot;The Lady&quot;, as she is known across Burma \u2013 democratic leader and daughter of the country&apos;s greatest hero, independence champion General Aung San. They stood in the sweltering heat, crouched on the roadway for hours, chanting &quot;long live Aung San Suu Kyi&quot; and waving signs. Her supporters, thousands dressed in T-shirts saying &quot;We stand with Aung San Suu Kyi&quot;, were joined on the streets by monks, the target of a violent military crackdown the last time crowds of this size were seen on Rangoon&apos;s streets, during 2007&apos;s &quot;Saffron Revolution&quot;. Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s arrival, dressed in a dark green traditional jacket and long skirt, was met with huge cheers and rapturous applause. She spoke in Burmese to the gathered crowd, telling them the future of the country was dependent on all of them, not just the nation&apos;s political leaders. Later, in the cramped office of the National League for Democracy (NLD), she said: &quot;I don&apos;t believe in one person&apos;s influence and authority to move a country forward. One person alone can not do something as important as bringing democracy to a country.&quot; Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s release has generated global media interest and cast Burma into the political spotlight. She said there were still 2,100 political prisoners in jails across Burma, and that no one in the country could feel truly free until they were all unconditionally released. &quot;If my people are not free, how can you say I am free. We are none of us free.&quot; Aung San Suu Kyi, 65, said her release by the military regime was unconditional, and that she was free to travel about the country. Previously the junta has attempted to restrict her movements and with whom she could meet. But she was coy when asked if she feared the junta could re-arrest her if they felt threatened by her huge popular appeal. Burma&apos;s generals have jailed her three times in the past two decades, either arbitrarily or on dubious charges, and international observers believe they could be moved to again if they felt her near-universal popularity weakened their grip on power. &quot;I do not think I am threatening, do you?&quot; she said. &quot;Popularity is something that comes and goes. I don&apos;t think anybody should feel threatened by it.&quot; She hinted she may have softened her stance on international sanctions, particularly from western countries, which have isolated Burma with trade sanctions for more than a decade. &quot;This is a time for Burma when we need help. We need everybody to help in this venture: western nations, eastern nations, all nations.&quot; Aung San Suu Kyi said she was enjoying her first few hours of freedom, particularly the chance to meet and talk with people. &quot;I have been listening to the radio for six years. I think I&apos;d like to listen to some real human voices.&quot; She said she had not had a chance to see much of the outside world, &quot;but I have noticed that a lot of people had mobile phones&quot;. She used a mobile for the first time on Sunday to call her son Kim, who is in Bangkok, and whom she hasn&apos;t seen for nearly a decade. Aung San Suu Kyi left her home a free woman for the first time in seven years shortly before 11am local time. In the back seat of a white sedan, she was driven from her lakeside home in northern Rangoon to the headquarters of her now-banned NLD. Traffic slowed the first half of her journey, as people began to recognise her on the streets of Rangoon for the first time in years. Within metres of the buiding, hundreds of people had crowded around, and a chain of people had to be formed around her car to keep back the crush. A crowd of several thousand people, spilling across Shwegondine Road, awaited her arrival at the NLD building which bears her image, and that of her father, on its front. It took nearly 15 minutes for her car to inch the final 100 metres, before she emerged, waving briefly to the crowd to rapturous applause and cheers, before being whisked inside by her entourage. Aung San Suu Kyi met first with diplomats, before giving the press conference and addressing her supporters. Thousands remained on the streets outside the NLD office, singing and chanting her name. Unusually for Burma, there has been no overt display of the country&apos;s feared security apparatus. Police and soldiers are nowhere to be seen. Gatherings of more than five people are technically illegal in Burma. The last time crowds of this size were seen on Rangoon&apos;s streets was during the Saffron Revolution of 2007, which was brutally suppressed by the military.", "publicationDate": "2010-11-14T09:48:37Z", "tags": ["Aung San Suu Kyi", "World news", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/14/aung-san-suu-kyi-burma-democracy", "title": "Aung San Suu Kyi calls for unity and reconciliation in Burma after release", "sentences": ["She used a mobile for the first time on Sunday to call her son Kim, who is in Bangkok, and whom she hasn&apos;t seen for nearly a decade."]}, {"article": "     Aung San Suu Kyi today reached out to the generals who jailed her, saying she wants direct talks with the military&apos;s leaders in the interests of &quot;national reconciliation&quot;. Aung San Suu Kyi has emerged from seven years&apos; house arrest, and incarceration at the junta&apos;s hands for 15 of the past 21 years, insisting she bears no grudge against her country&apos;s military regime. She has urged reconciliation and unity for Burma. She has hinted, too, that she may be willing to soften her stance in favour of international sanctions against Burma&apos;s military junta, but insisted that true progress could not be made until all of the country&apos;s 2,100 political prisoners were freed. Despite her historic release at the weekend, and the euphoria that has enveloped Burma in its aftermath, concerns remain that this could be a false dawn for the country and not a &quot;Mandela moment&quot; that signals the start of genuine political reform. Today, speaking publicly for the first time since her release on Saturday, Aung San Suu Kyi told supporters she needed their support to transform the country. &quot;I think we all have to work together. I wish to work in unison with the people of Burma,&quot; she said. She stressed she alone could not lead the country to democracy after 50 years of military rule. &quot;I don&apos;t believe in one person&apos;s influence and authority to move a country forward,&quot; she said. &quot;One person alone cannot do something as important as bringing democracy to a country.&quot; More than 10,000 supporters, many wearing T-shirts bearing Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s image or with photographs of her pinned to their clothes, rallied outside the headquarters of her now banned political party, the National League for Democracy, cramming Shwegondine Road in central Rangoon to listen to her speak. Many held up signs saying &quot;We love Suu&quot;. In response she lifted a handwritten sign saying &quot;I love the public, too&quot;. Aung San Suu Kyi said she had a message for the regime&apos;s senior general, Than Shwe: &quot;Let&apos;s speak to each other directly.&quot; She added: &quot;I am for national reconciliation. I am for dialogue.&quot; The pair last met in secret talks in 2002 at the encouragement of the United Nations, just months before the junta arrested her again. There has been no word from Burma&apos;s jungle capital, Nay Pi Daw, on whether the regime&apos;s leaders wish to meet her, and there are doubts over the junta&apos;s commitment to reform. Dr Maung Zarni, a Burma research fellow at the London School of Economics, said the junta had released political prisoners before, usually to win favour internationally, but had rearrested them when it felt the need to reassert control. &quot;We should not fool ourselves to think that her release signals the desire on the part of the regime towards democratisation, dialogue and reconciliation,&quot; Zarni said. &quot;Her release is simply a tactical move. The regime is still holding over 2,100 prisoners of conscience \u2026 many serving ridiculously lengthy prison sentences. They must all be freed if we are to be convinced of the regime&apos;s desire towards reconciliation.&quot; Burma&apos;s generals have jailed Aung San Suu Kyi three times in the past two decades, either arbitrarily or on dubious charges, and Zarni said they could be moved to do so again if they felt her near-universal popularity was weakening their grip on power. But asked if she feared being imprisoned again, Aung San Suu Kyi was deliberately coy. &quot;I do not think I am threatening, do you?&quot; the 65-year-old grandmother said. &quot;Popularity is something that comes and goes. I don&apos;t think anybody should feel threatened by it. But I know that there&apos;s always the possibility that I might be rearrested. It&apos;s not something that I particularly wish for, because if you&apos;re placed under arrest, you can&apos;t work as much as you can when you&apos;re not under arrest.&quot; Others cautiously believe the junta&apos;s move could mark the beginning of genuine reform. The Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean), which counts Burma as a member but which the west has accused of not doing enough to push for change there, welcomed the release. &quot;I&apos;m very, very relieved and hope that this will contribute to true national reconciliation,&quot; said the secretary-general, Surin Pitsuwan. Aung San Suu Kyi also met a corps of diplomats today, including representatives from Britain, the European Union and Asean countries. Later, during a wide-ranging press conference, Aung San Suu Kyi said that while during her years of imprisonment she &quot;felt free within myself&quot;, she would not rest until all of Burma&apos;s political prisoners were released unconditionally. &quot;If my people are not free, how can you say I am free?&quot; she said. &quot;We are none of us free.&quot; Aung San Suu Kyi has been a strong supporter of trade sanctions, which have isolated Burma for more than a decade, but appeared to indicate a willingness to reconsider. &quot;This is a time for Burma when we need help,&quot; she said. &quot;We need everybody to help in this venture. Western nations, eastern nations, all nations.&quot; Her previous spells of liberty have come with conditions attached by the military, limiting her movements and with whom she could meet, but the military had not imposed any restrictions on her this time, she said. Her first formal act is likely to be a response to last weekend&apos;s elections, which were marred by reports of voter intimidation, bribery and stuffed ballot boxes. The election was won overwhelmingly by the junta&apos;s party. Aung San Suu Kyi was banned from participating and her party urged a boycott, resulting in a poor voter turnout. An NLD committee is set to investigate all complaints independently. &quot;From what I have heard there are many, many questions about the fairness of the election and there are many, many allegations of vote rigging and so on,&quot; she said. Aung San Suu Kyi said today she was enjoying her freedom, particularly the chance to meet and talk to people. &quot;I have been listening to the radio for six years,&quot; she said. &quot;I think I&apos;d like to listen to some real human voices.&quot; She said she had not had a chance to see very much of the outside world, &quot;but I have noticed that a lot of people have mobile phones&quot;. She used a mobile for the first time on Sunday to call her son Kim, who is in Bangkok, and whom she hasn&apos;t seen for nearly a decade. She has never met her grandchildren. Aung San Suu Kyi spent her first afternoon of freedom at Rangoon&apos;s Shwedagon pagoda, then attended the funeral of an NLD colleague. Voices from the street &quot;Our future depends on Aung San Suu Kyi. She gives us hope and courage. Only she can free us from this anarchist regime.&quot; National League for Democracy youth leader, Nyi Min &quot;I think of her as my mother and my sister and grandmother because she&apos;s the daughter of our independence leader General Aung San.

It&apos;s the first, and probably the only, drug they think of. For that matter, it&apos;s quinine in a drip that any adult or child with severe malaria will get in the UK too, should they be unfortunate enough to come home with the disease. But it is time to think again \u2013 and quickly. Hundreds of thousands of children&apos;s lives could be saved if a Chinese drug were used to treat severe malaria instead. The biggest study every conducted into children&apos;s malaria treatment, published in the Lancet recently, proves that artesunate is much better than quinine. Unfortunately, says Prof Nick White, who, with colleagues from Mahidol University in Bangkok and the University of Oxford carried out the study, convention, tradition and suspicion of drugs that do not originate from western big pharma are preventing the take up of artesunate by doctors. The study, funded by the charitable foundation the Wellcome Trust and with no pharmaceutical company involvement, is &quot;the largest trial that will ever be done in severe malaria&quot;, says White. It involved 5,425 very sick children. &quot;It was enormous and it shows an enormous reduction in mortality,&quot; he says. Mild or early malaria cases are already treated using artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) \u2013 drugs made from the same plant as artesunate in combination with older anti-malarials. There is a big push - funded by international donors - to make low-cost ACTs available across malarial-endemic countries. The case for artesunate in severe malaria was proven for adults in a big trial in Asia in 2005. There were 39% fewer deaths among those given artesunate than among those treated with quinine. You might have thought it stood to reason that children \u2013 the main victims of malaria \u2013 would benefit from artesunate too. There are nearly 1 million malaria deaths a year and most of them are children under the age of two. One child dies from the mosquito-borne disease every 30 seconds. But five years on, quinine is universally still used. But, after the Mahidol/Oxford unit&apos;s trial in 11 hospitals in Africa, the case for artesunate is indisputable. Quinine, derived from the bark of a tree and used for 300 years, is now clearly second-best. In the latest trial, child deaths were reduced by 22.5% - a lower percentage than in adults because, White thinks, some children are brought in with fever that is not malaria, but in terms of numbers, that is large. Potentially 100,000 lives could be saved a year, the researchers believe. Artesunate is also safer \u2013 it can be injected, where quinine must be given by intravenous drip - and does not have quinine&apos;s unpleasant side-effects. So why aren&apos;t doctors rushing to get supplies? White talks of suspicion of artesunate, which is made by the Guilin pharmaceutical company in China. In spite of the excellent trial results, there was doubt over the quality of the product. Just over a week ago, however, it was finally given pre-qualified status by the World Health Organisation (WHO), which means its safety is approved. But changing habits may still be hard. &quot;We need to overcome all sorts of things like prejudice and sloth,&quot; says White. &quot;British physicians still think quinine is better. It is nuts \u2013 absolutely nuts.&quot; And reservations by British doctors may make African doctors reluctant too. WHO will be revisiting its advice on malaria treatment soon and \u2013 with White on the committee \u2013 will undoubtedly recommend a switch to artesunate. It needs to happen as fast as possible, White believes. &quot;Name any other infectious disease where a drug has been shown to be that much better,&quot; he says. Last word to Sir Mark Walport, director of the Wellcome Trust and a British scientist who wholeheartedly endorsed the trial&apos;s findings:  This is an extremely important clinical trial of the treatment of malaria, showing improved survival of patients with severe malaria in Africa. There are still many hurdles to overcome and we must be vigilant to protect against resistance to these new drugs and against a market in counterfeit drugs. But Prof White and colleagues have shown that we have the potential to save the lives of hundreds of thousands of children.

Former US president Bill Clinton has reportedly filmed a cameo in Bangkok for the film, which sees bachelors Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis and Justin Bartha heading to Thailand for a whole new stag do. Mike Tyson&apos;s cameo, along with that of his tiger, was the standout moment of the first movie, and director Todd Phillips was clearly looking for somebody with a similarly roguish image when he lined up Gibson to play a cobbler in round two. When it emerged that Phillips had abandoned plans to cast the Lethal Weapon star after complaints from cast and crew, producers swiftly announced that Neeson would take his place, and the earth failed to shake. The Oscar-nominated actor still seems to be taking that role, so one can only assume that Clinton&apos;s part is an even smaller one. The gossip site TMZ reckons he&apos;ll be playing himself, but surely we won&apos;t see him spoofing his own travails or sending up the more dubious aspects of his public persona? One cannot imagine the lure of five minutes in the Hollywood headlights being enough to have him suddenly airing his dirty laundry in public. Galifianakis, who played socially challenged brother-in-law-to-be Alan in the first movie, has denied reports that he was among those who spoke out against Gibson&apos;s employment. Neeson seems to have got his gig after another cast member, Cooper, tapped up his A-Team co-star to save the day just as the shoot was about to commence.

Bout, a former Soviet air force officer who has spent more than two years in a maximum security prison in Bangkok, was put on a plane to the US within hours of the Thai cabinet approving an extradition order. He arrived late Tuesday night at the Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh, a US law enforcement official said. Prosecutors in the US have charged him over an alleged attempt to sell guns to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), which is designated as a terrorist organisation by Washington and the EU. Bout, whose life story is said to have inspired the Hollywood film Lord of War starring Nicolas Cage, claims to merely have run an air cargo business that specialised in flying to conflict areas. While shipping weapons to Africa he also worked as a subcontractor for the US military in Iraq, Nato in Afghanistan and for commercial firms. Russia, which appears to be concerned that a trial might reveal links between Bout and its military and intelligence operations, had pressed Thailand to return him to Moscow. It has questioned the US claim of jurisdiction given that he is not an American citizen and is not alleged to have committed crimes on US soil. &quot;Undoubtedly, the illegal extradition of Bout is a result of the unprecedented political pressure on the Thai government and the judicial authorities by the United States,&quot; said Russia&apos;s foreign ministry. &quot;This is nothing other than an intrusion into legal procedures. This makes questionable the independence of the Thai judicial system and decisions made by Thai authorities.&quot; Bout was arrested in Thailand in March 2008 on an international arrest warrant following a US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) operation aimed at suppliers of weapons to Farc which the group uses to defend its extensive drug trafficking operation. Within hours of the Thai cabinet&apos;s decision Bout was removed from his prison cell, placed in a bulletproof vest and escorted to a chartered plane by police commandos in balaclavas and combat gear, where he was handed over to DEA agents. Bout&apos;s wife, Alla, rushed to the prison with his lawyer when she heard her husband was about to be deported but did not get to see him. She accused Thai officials of deceiving her and Russian diplomats. &quot;The operation was secret,&quot; she told Russia Today television. &quot;The cabinet ordered the extradition of Viktor Bout, even though the prime minister of Thailand had said that while court proceedings are ongoing, he wouldn&apos;t be extradited \u2026 he was shipped to the United States as if he was just a thing, without his documents and without the Russian embassy being informed. The operation was so quick because it is illegal under Thai law. I plan to appeal.&quot; Bout has been linked to a long list of authoritarian regimes and conflicts over the past 15 years. The former British cabinet minister, Peter Hain, branded him &quot;Africa&apos;s chief merchant of death&quot; for his involvement in countries such as Angola, Sierra Leone and Sudan. For many years Bout ran a weapons pipeline in to the war ravaged east of the Democratic Republic of Congo and shipped out minerals, such as the coltan used in making mobile phones, plundered by rebel groups and foreign armies. He also helped arm the Liberian rebel leader, Charles Taylor, who later became president and is now on trial before the international criminal court for war crimes. In 2005 the US authorities froze the assets of several companies in which Bout had a stake after the Bush administration barred trade with Taylor. The US also alleges that Bout made tens of millions of dollars selling arms to the Taliban when it was governing Afghanistan. Bout has been identified as flying weapons originating in Jordan to Peru, some of which made their way to the Farc. However, part of the Russian criticism of the American charges against Bout stems from the continued US use of him to transport supplies in Iraq as well as contracting with Nato in Afghanistan and the United Nations in Sudan. Moscow and Washington put strong pressure on the Thai government over the case. A Bangkok court initially declined to extradite Bout to the US but that decision was overturned on appeal. The Americans sent a plane to collect Bout but the case stalled again when US prosecutors added new charges of money laundering which required a new hearing.", "publicationDate": "2010-11-16T19:02:59Z", "tags": ["US news", "Russia", "World news", "Viktor Bout", "Europe"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/16/russian-arms-dealer-extradited", "title": "Viktor Bout, suspected Russian arms dealer, extradited to New York", "sentences": ["Bout, a former Soviet air force officer who has spent more than two years in a maximum security prison in Bangkok, was put on a plane to the US within hours of the Thai cabinet approving an extradition order.", "A Bangkok court initially declined to extradite Bout to the US but that decision was overturned on appeal."]}, {"article": "I am embarking on a round the world(ish) trip on 4 January. I have got my ticket already but have to organise a flight from Bangkok to Delhi for 24 April. I&apos;m hoping you can help by suggesting some budget airlines that fly this route. Furthermore, if I book it earlier will it be any cheaper or is time irrelevant to the price of a flight? Ashley-May Cashwell Air Asia is launching this route from 10 December, and is offering one-way fares for \u00a349 including taxes, operated by Thai Air Asia. At a rate of just over 2p a mile I wouldn&apos;t hesitate too much before booking this fare even if it is non-refundable. Air Asia is the best known of the Asian budget carriers, but Jetstar Asia (the Singapore-based offshoot of Qantas-owned Jetstar), Tiger Airways and Bangkok Airways (both operating from Bangkok) offer useful connections around the region. In India, budget carriers are increasingly reaching out to neighbouring countries, with the excellently-monickered SpiceJet flying from Delhi to Colombo and Kathmandu. Other options on the subcontinent for cheap flights include Air India Express, IndiGo and Deccan Airlines. I&apos;m thinking of making a northern lights trip for my birthday with a group of friends. It will need to be on a tightish budget, and I&apos;d prefer to avoid an organised tour. I also want to make sure that if it&apos;s not possible to see the lights, that the trip itself would be exciting anyway. I don&apos;t really have a preference as to which country to visit, but was mainly thinking Sweden or Iceland. I&apos;ve had a bit of a look round, but mostly found packages...Bex Singleton Aside from the excellent suggestions in this week&apos;s Guardian Insiders&apos; Guide to the northern lights I have two Swedish suggestions.\u00a0 The first and most economical option is to take advantage of SAS&apos;s new weekly direct three-hour flight (\u00a3175 return including taxes) from Heathrow to Lulea, in northern Sweden. The town is an excellent base for winter activities including husky sledding as well as being a lively base for exploring the surrounding area. Specific northern lights spotting trips aren&apos;t available, but simply by getting out and about you stand an excellent chance of seeing the lights. The Vandrarhem Kronan Hostel (vandrarhemmetkronan.se) set in woodland a couple of miles from the city centre has single rooms from \u00a322 and its darker location makes it a smart and good-value option. There are also hotels to aim for in the city centre. Unless you go for a week, however, you&apos;ll need to add in the best part of a day to fly back via Stockholm. Abisko Mountain Station (abisko.nu; singles from \u00a362; cheaper hostel accommodation also available) offers basic but comfortable beds in the national park of the same name. Abisko has a reputation for clearer skies than other northern regions. It is surrounded by mountains and has less cloud cover. This beautiful, remote setting is perfect for aurora spotting as well as Nordic skiing, ice climbing and snowshoeing, all of which you can arrange when you get there. The Aurora Sky Station (auroraskystation.se), a viewing station reached by a chairlift, can be visited nightly giving you the best possible chance of seeing the lights. It costs \u00a362 to go up for one evening or you can get access included in an accommodation package. Discounts on the above are available for YHA (Hostelling International) members (yha.org.uk). Visit Sweden (visitsweden.com) has more information on all of this. Taxi transfers can be arranged from Kiruna Airport for \u00a3140 per car \u2013 more reasonable if there are a few of you sharing, or there are train and bus options. Return flights from the UK to Kiruna go via Stockholm \u2013 charter flights are only available as part of a package \u2013 and start at \u00a3283.60 including taxes. If you have more time you could also look into taking the night train (sj.se), which runs directly from Stockholm to the station at Abisko with no need for transfers. This would also give the possibility of cutting down on flight costs by taking a cheaper flight. Me and my boyfriend are off to San Francisco for five days in early November for a wedding on the Friday and Saturday. We&apos;ve both been before so have done all the touristy stuff and would love recommendations on good bars, restaurants and boutiques to check out. We want to hang out with locals rather than tourists if at all possible.Claire\u00a0Barry     Green 'living' roof of the California Academy of Sciences. Photograph: Art on File/Corbis    Lonely Planet&apos;s American base is in Oakland, a short hop across the bay from San Francisco so I asked for a few suggestions from them. It&apos;s not hard to leave tourists behind in San Francisco \u2013 just steer clear of cable cars, Fisherman&apos;s Wharf and Alcatraz and big-name chain restaurants. If you haven&apos;t been for a couple of years you may have missed the reopening of the California Academy of Sciences (calacademy.org) a gorgeous museum with a full aquarium, a multi-storied rainforest \u2013 complete with wildlife - a state of the art planetarium, a living roof that is home to native plants and a cafe that only serves organic, local and sustainable food items. The new building was designed by Renzo Piano. It gets lots of families and school groups, but is adults only on Thursday nights. A great street to shop and eat is Hayes Street in between Franklin and Laguna Streets, west of the Tenderloin. Arlequin (arlequincafe.com) and Bar Jules (barjules.com) are recommended for eating and drinking. If you don&apos;t get round to a reservation, an early-evening mooch around should take you past somewhere you fancy. For dessert you can really go to town. SF is crazy for artisanal ice-cream right now with some marvellously odd flavours to try. Humphry Slocombe (humphryslocombe.com) located in the Mission is one place to head for, though you&apos;ll find other examples on your travels. Join the queue and pick up a few tips on flavours. For a late drink aim for Bourbon &amp; Branch (bourbonandbranch.com) on Jones Street close to Union Square. It&apos;s decor and speakeasy-style secrecy harks back to the Prohibition days and you need to call ahead for a password if you want to sit in the main bar area. I am going to Paris in the week before Christmas. Is there anything in particular you would recommend to get into the festive spirit?Eva Johnson There are traditional Christmas markets all over the city, from the huge one lining the Champs-Elys\u00e9es \u2013 itself festooned with an impressive lights display - to smaller ones at Place Saint-Sulpice and Place des Abbesses in Montmartre, and though these can feel a little cheesy they&apos;re pleasant places for a festive stroll. You should aim for the Hotel de Ville in the evening \u2013 the winter ice rink there is no secret but remains one of the most beautiful locations in the city with a lovely atmosphere. Skating is free if you have your own blades or it costs \u20ac5 to hire a pair. The window displays of stores throughout town are striking, but those of the huge department stores on Boulevard Haussmann are especially impressive. Smaller boutiques in the Marais and the streets between Place St Germain de-Pres and the Seine offer lower-key opportunities to pick up last-minute presents. \u00a0", "publicationDate": "2010-11-17T10:29:24Z", "tags": ["Travel", "Flights", "Asia", "Northern lights holidays", "Sweden holidays", "San Francisco holidays", "Paris holidays"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2010/nov/17/ask-tom-northern-lights-budget-flights", "title": "Ask Tom - your travel dilemmas answered", "sentences": ["I have got my ticket already but have to organise a flight from Bangkok to Delhi for 24 April.", "Air Asia is the best known of the Asian budget carriers, but Jetstar Asia (the Singapore-based offshoot of Qantas-owned Jetstar), Tiger Airways and Bangkok Airways (both operating from Bangkok) offer useful connections around the region."]}, {"article": "As someone who marks papers, Karen Borrington sees her fair share of excuses, even if they are not in quite the same league as &quot;the dog ate my homework&quot;. One boy wrote on his exam paper: &quot;I&apos;m very sorry I haven&apos;t revised as hard as I should have, but I have been taking out my girlfriend.&quot; Another hapless examinee wrote: &quot;Dear examiner, I have tried really hard, please be kind to my paper.&quot; On top of her job as a teacher of economics and business studies at the Ecclesbourne school in Duffield, near Derby, Borrington works as a principal examiner of Cambridge IGCSEs, the internationally recognised alternative to GCSE for 14 to 16-year-olds. &quot;I wanted to do it to help me become a better teacher,&quot; she says. &quot;Having a good understanding of assessment helps me to be more effective in my teaching of all ability of students and helping students to achieve their potential.&quot; It also didn&apos;t hurt that becoming an examiner brought in a little of bit of extra money, she says. An added bonus is the travel. In the last 10 years, part of her job is to make flying visits far afield for intense training sessions for those teaching IGCSE courses. &quot;I was sent to Nairobi and part-way in the afternoon, there was a &apos;thump thump&apos; on the roof of the outbuilding,&quot; she says in her strong Derbyshire accent. &quot;The teachers all laughed and said not to worry. At three in the afternoon, a troop of baboons always goes across the roof.&quot; The atmosphere was more sombre when she travelled to Jakarta on another training session, just after the 9/11 attacks. Every time she arrived at her hotel in the Indonesian capital her taxi was stopped and searched. She has also trained teachers in Mauritius, Sri Lanka, Brunei and India. It sounds glamorous, particularly for someone who was born in Derby and has spent most her life in villages around there, including Heage where she lived opposite a windmill. The trips, however, are gruelling and there is little time for sightseeing. &quot;It&apos;s two or three days of intensive work,&quot; she says. &quot;You are pretty tired by the time you come back, but it&apos;s very interesting working with different people. You are actually meeting local people in a way that you don&apos;t when you are on holiday.&quot; When Borrington went to Chennai, India, she arrived late on a Thursday, rested on Friday and did teacher training on Saturday and Sunday. &quot;You could say I went to India for the weekend,&quot; she says. During these training sessions, she helps teachers understand what students need to do to earn high marks from questions. A technique she uses comes from Dragon&apos;s Den, the BBC TV programme where a panel of investors interviews entrepreneurs for possible investment opportunities. It&apos;s a way to convey to teachers that they need to solicit the analytical skills students must have to succeed in exams. Surprisingly for a teacher, and somebody who trains teachers, she does not like to &quot;perform&quot; in front of an audience. &quot;I am not an extrovert,&quot; she says. &quot;Standing in front of a class was something I had to learn how to do. It did not come naturally. You&apos;ll always find me at the back of the class, working away with groups.&quot; Borrington, who graduated with an economics degree from the University of Leicester, has been an examiner for more than 20 years, her curiosity piqued by an Ecclesbourne colleague who was doing the same thing. She is now one of about 9,000 Cambridge IGCSE examiners marking papers from all over the world. Marking takes place in June, July and November, when Borrington has to wade through hundreds of submissions. July gets particularly busy, when she has to mark as many as 400 to 500 scripts in three to four weeks. Some examiners blitz solidly through the weekend but Borrington likes to keep her Saturday evenings free, so gets up at 6am during the week. Still in her dressing gown, she&apos;ll make a cup of coffee and switch on her laptop. All marking is done online, eliminating the need for masses of papers on the kitchen table. It&apos;s a rural setting, so the view through the window is of flowers, trees, the odd squirrel, blue tits, sparrows, starlings and the neighbour&apos;s cat. After an hour she takes a break, showers, gets dressed and works for another hour before the house wakes up. It takes her about an hour to go through four or five scripts, although she will take longer over really good candidates as there is more to read. She then spends another two hours marking in the evening. &quot;In the middle of exam season, you need to be very well organised, you have to set yourself so many scripts to mark and meet the deadlines. And you have to be consistent, you can&apos;t get up one day and say &apos;I feel mean&apos;. You should be applying marks as set out in the guidelines.&quot; Borrington says she tries to mark &quot;positively&quot; and not look to &quot;knock marks off&quot;. When a paper initially gets a very low mark, she rereads it two or three times to see &quot;if there is anything I can give credit for&quot;. This approach, she says, reflects the changing nature of examinations in the past 20 years. Besides marking she also sets papers, an art in itself. The whole process takes over a year from start to finish. First, she drafts a paper and a mark scheme, then sends it for review and comments. It will come back for redrafting, after which an evaluation committee makes a final draft that will become the examination paper. &quot;We have to make sure the paper is as good as it can be and fair,&quot; she says. Devising papers, Borrington says, requires conscientiousness, creativity and care. &quot;You have to be very careful how you phrase questions,&quot; she says. &quot;The language must be clear and not ambiguous. You have to avoid words with multiple meanings.&quot; It helps that that she has an eye for detail. She says she is the kind of person who mentally keeps track of how much she has spent on her credit card and has never run up an overdraft. In the 1990s, she helped to run an air conditioning business and did the accounts, all background knowledge which serves her well when setting questions now. As her papers are designed for students all over the world \u2013 this year, Cambridge IGCSE papers were taken by students in more than 120 countries as well as at some 400 schools in the UK \u2013 the subjects and questions have to be &quot;culturally sensitive&quot;, so no mention of alcohol or Christmas trees, for example. Case studies, therefore, need to revolve around businesses relevant everywhere to any part of the world \u2013 restaurants, hotels or taxis. In past papers, she has constructed questions around a vegetable farm, a newspaper printing company, a furniture shop and a car repairer, to name but a few. &quot;You start with a business and you think of what problems it would have and then you look for questions on various aspects of that business such as HR, marketing, finance, where it&apos;s going to sell, the competition,&quot; she says. &quot;You try and keep it general.&quot; Papers typically have five questions split into two parts: the first tests a candidate&apos;s knowledge and application, while the second measures analytical and evaluative skills \u2013 where the bulk of the marks are scored. The candidate has one hour and 45 minutes for the test, which is marked out of 100. The highest she ever gave was 98 and the lowest a big fat zero \u2013 to a candidate &quot;who just copied chunks out of the case study&quot;, she recalls. &quot;They had written something for every answer but didn&apos;t say anything. It&apos;s very rare. Usually candidates do very well&quot;. And even though English is a second language for many of her candidates, she reckons that once the exams begin, they are not necessarily at a disadvantage to native English speakers. &quot;When you set papers, you want candidates to demonstrate what they can do,&quot; she says. &quot;You want them to think, &apos;Oh, I can have a go at that,&apos; when they look at the questions. You try to prepare papers that are inviting.&quot; Sometimes her inspiration comes from the least likely places. &quot;When we travel, I&apos;m always on the lookout for businesses to use for case studies,&quot; she says. &quot;When wandering through Bangkok airport I saw several flower shops selling flower arrangements, and this started me thinking about the ones you see in hotels and restaurants.&quot; And so comfortable is she with her work, it has become a form of relaxation, albeit not one that might instantly appeal to many. &quot;I think about case studies when sitting on a beach,&quot; she says. &quot;It is so peaceful; it gives me time to think and put together the outline of a question paper. Then I research and write it up when I get home.&quot; Curriculum vitae Pay &quot;You&apos;re paid per script so for an exam session, anything from \u00a3800 upwards, depending on the number of scripts and exams marked.&quot; Hours &quot;As I also teach full-time my days are fairly long during the examination session. An examiner will work on average three to four hours a day so I fit this round my school day by getting up about 6am and marking for one to two hours before going to school and then early evening to about 9pm. As a principal examiner, I also need to reply to emails and telephone calls from my team.&quot; Work/life balance I have to be very organised, so I still see friends and go riding. Life has to be fun. Best thing Having a question paper I set answered \u2013 I am happy it worked as intended. I also love training teachers in other countries. Worst thing Having to be extremely disciplined about marking a set number of hours each day. Overtime At parties people ask Karen whether she works for a living because of long school holidays: &apos;I just laugh.&apos; They also ask about the many places she has been to train teachers, which include Botswana, Indonesia, Namibia, Singapore and India.

Once again this involves donning your assassin&apos;s hoodie, shanking various unsavoury noblemen and escaping via precipitous rooftop parkour. While structurally similar to its most recent forebear, climbing buildings and free-running feel far more fluid and less on-rails, making it easier to direct Ezio off high ledges to his death and in the process delivering a more involving and visceral experience. Scaling towers opens up new areas of the map and handing over gold to renovate banks and shops raises your income and expands the list of items for sale. There are new weapons and fights are bigger and more frequent, taking on multiple opponents and entire military posts. In spite of numerous tweaks, this feels like a marginal evolution of the last Assassin&apos;s Creed, but is certainly highly entertaining. Ubisoft, \u00a349.99  007: Blood Stone, PC, PS3 &amp; Xbox 360     007: Blood Stone.    With the voices and likenesses of Daniel Craig and Dame Judy Dench, a silhouette-strewn opening title sequence and action spanning the globe from Monaco to Bangkok to a Burmese prison camp, Blood Stone does its level best to be this year&apos;s Bond film. The parts you can actually play are dominated by battles fought with silenced pistols and submachine guns, relying heavily on getting Bond to take cover behind conveniently appointed pieces of scenery. They&apos;re simplistic affairs, with some enemies popping in and out of cover like so many clockwork targets while others suicidally march towards you in the open. Brief car chases break up the shooting, requiring you to learn where traffic and explosions occur by rote, until you can steer your way around them, despite the track often being fully obscured by smoke and flying debris. Authentic in both content and style, the game feels neglected by comparison, with little to engage and a multiplayer mode that&apos;s perfunctory at best. Activision, \u00a334.99-\u00a349.99 Lil&apos; Pirates, iPhone     Lil' Pirates.    There&apos;s something cloying about a lot of social network games in their continual entreaties to pester your friends. Equally, free-to-play games tend to be hard to enjoy without springing for paid upgrades. Lil&apos; Pirates, despite being free and wanting you to sign in via Facebook, doesn&apos;t create too much nuisance for your acquaintances although a lack of doubloons (\u00a32.99 buys you 30) rapidly starts to impede progress. The game comprises quests to enrich your miniature pirates, refreshing them with a mug of foaming root beer or by beating them in one of a succession of mildly diverting mini games. Some missions take seconds, others minutes and others hours, meaning several things are going on at all times, each layer providing a small yet addictive stimulus to embark on more adventures, expand your crew, harvest growing treasure troves, brawl with rabid dolphins or adopt a monkey. Though essentially bland, its cute graphics, piratey dialogue and mellow action make it unexpectedly likable.

He takes his temperature and asks about his symptoms. Then he gets out a smartphone and plugs in Dom&apos;s answers. &quot;I am very worried about malaria,&quot; says Chavilai. &quot;If a malaria case comes late and we cannot treat them, they will die. Many years ago we used to see that.&quot; Now, though, this is much less likely to happen. With 800 malaria posts and clinics and universal free treatment, Thailand far outstrips its neighbours&apos; disease management, a fact reflected in its dramatic drop in cases, from six figures in 2000 to 20,000 in 2008. In the seven provinces bordering Cambodia, only 308 people have contracted the deadliest strain of the malaria, caused by the mosquito-borne parasite Plasmodium falciparum, this year. That&apos;s just as well because, in 2007, scientists confirmed that artemisinin-based combination therapies, the drugs used to kill P. falciparum, were taking longer to work on the Thai/Cambodian border, a region which has seen resistance to effective malaria treatments, including chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, emerge several times in the past and spread across the world. In 2008, fearing the global impact of yet another drug-resistant strain, particularly in Africa where malaria kills about 800,000 people every year, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which has set global malaria eradication as one of its aims, funded a $22.5m (\u00a314m) regional containment programme. Radical approaches Yet, for Professor Nicholas White of Bangkok&apos;s Mahidol-Oxford Research Unit, containment is not enough. &quot;Once malaria drugs go down the tube, that&apos;s it,&quot; he says. &quot;You&apos;ve got to have a new one and we haven&apos;t got a new one. So shouldn&apos;t we do something really unusual about this? Why not pull out all the stops, do everything we possibly can and get rid\u00a0of it?&quot; Radical approaches, such as mass drug administration, mass screening and treatment, will be considered at a conference this autumn. However, according to Dr Prudence Hamade, senior technical adviser at Malaria Consortium, which is working in Thailand and Cambodia to improve access to accurate information to contain resistance, these approaches depend on being able to &quot;get hold of all the people&quot;. In Thailand, where roughly half of malaria patients are Cambodian and Burmese migrant workers, that can be hard, as Ahwat Masarath knows. She runs a malaria post at her village home in the Pong Nam Ron district. &quot;It&apos;s very difficult working with migrant people,&quot; she says. &quot;At one place, the first time I went to do blood tests, the workers tried to escape because they didn&apos;t know what it was about and they were afraid. Most of them hide somewhere in the forest. It takes a long time to build up trust.&quot; Initiatives such as building links between clinics and business owners, running educational sessions, providing free mosquito nets and producing bilingual leaflets and posters, are underway. Yet the message seems slow to get through. &quot;Some people buy medication on the black market if they think they have malaria,&quot; says Cambodian fruit farm labourer Nath Chay, 29, who spends six months a year in Thailand. &quot;Others go home. On this farm, if we get sick the owner will take us to the clinic but that&apos;s not the case everywhere.&quot; A study in 2004 found black market counterfeit anti-malarials account for up to 53% of samples bought in mainland south-east Asia. Asymptomatic carriers and the possibility that diagnostic tools miss low levels of infection also mean it&apos;s likely that only 70% of Thailand&apos;s malaria cases are recorded. The others come and go unobserved, taking the parasites with them, as the ominous reports of lengthening drug-response times coming from the Thai/Burmese border suggest. Establishing co-operation isn&apos;t just a local problem. The international collaboration necessary for elimination is hampered by the diplomatic tension between Thailand and Cambodia, the secretive Burmese regime and the piecemeal division of south-east Asia into two World Health Organisation (WHO) regions. This puts neighbouring countries under different administrative umbrellas. WHO&apos;s Mekong Malaria Programme (MMP) was designed to address this by fostering cross-border partnerships. Although, after two years, there is no joint grant from the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria for the Thai and Cambodian national malaria programmes, the countries have agreed to share information and meet at cross-border workshops organised by Malaria Consortium and the WHO and through the Asian Collaborative Training Network for Malaria. Now Dr Charles Delacollette, MMP&apos;s co-ordinator, would like to see the countries invest more. Committing funds &quot;Country members are not committing enough of their domestic money,&quot; he says. &quot;They say to WHO &apos;can you do it?&apos;&quot; However, at the Bureau of Vector-Borne Disease in Thailand&apos;s Ministry of Public Health, director, Dr Wichai Satimai has other priorities. Dengue fever is on the rise and there is an outbreak of arthritis-inducing Chikungunya. The malaria budget has just been cut and soon it will be amalgamated into general health spending. &quot;If we are going to contain or eliminate malaria we must have more Global Fund money,&quot; he says. &quot;The problem is the whole world&apos;s problem. They have to help us. We cannot do it by ourselves.&quot; But the world has a doubtful disease elimination record. Of seven attempted eradication programmes, only one, smallpox, has ever succeeded. Countries such as India, which got malaria down to 50,000 cases during the global drive of the 1950s and 60s, now have infection rates in the millions again. There is a $4bn annual shortfall in the amount of money the WHO estimates it will take to wipe it out. At Bangkok&apos;s Mahidol University, the dean, Professor Pratap, feels it too. &quot;I sense that [the Thai government] are not very serious,&quot; he says. &quot;I want them to announce that Thailand will be free of malaria in 10 years and this is the strategy. They have not said that. Now they don&apos;t talk about malaria at all.&quot; Back in Trat Province, Chavilai packs up his samples and heads to the clinic. For now, with his patient on the $5-a-day drug malarone, he is confident that the slide he is about to examine under the microscope will be parasite-free. Utilising technology: &apos;If the map turns red, they know they should do something&apos; At Mahidol University, the findings from Angkhum Chavilai&apos;s latest follow-up appointment flash up on Professor Pratap&apos;s smartphone, joining the database that records and maps all malaria cases in the Thai containment\u00a0zone. &quot;A map can help the decision-makers decide what is happening,&quot; says Jaranit Kaewkungwal, director of the university&apos;s Biophics department, which developed the system with the help of a Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation grant. &quot;If the map is getting\u00a0more red, they know they should do something.&quot; Now nearing the end of its first full year of use, the pioneering Biophics technology allows national and regional malaria staff to have a real-time overview of cases, including information about drug response times, symptoms and even patients&apos; photographs. Such rapid data analysis will be essential if Thailand is ever going to meet WHO&apos;s stringent malaria elimination criterion of no more than three locally transmitted cases in three consecutive years \u2013 standards that even the USA, which had eight linked cases in Florida in 2003, sometimes fails to meet. However, in terms of the information collected, this first version, which developers hope can be adapted for other regions, countries and health programmes, is deliberately close to the paper recording system local staff were using before. For Dr Vipat Kuruchittham, technical officer at Malaria Consortium&apos;s office, which is helping to pilot and evaluate a similar system under a USAID-funded malaria elimination project in the island province of Phuket, such familiarity is\u00a0crucial. The Phuket initiative aims to eliminate malaria altogether. Malaria Consortium is also working on user-friendly systems to allow sharing of data between Thailand and Cambodia to speed up the response to the spread of resistance. &quot;We have to change bit by bit,&quot; Vipat says. &quot;We are trying to reduce the burden with the limited staff they have. That&apos;s the point of technology in health. But the people have to be willing to use it. That&apos;s the thing.&quot; Containment at the border: the soldiers&apos; role &quot;Everyone has to know about malaria because we have to contain it. It&apos;s very dangerous.&quot; Chay Sopann, a Thai border guard in Pong Nam Ron, Chanthaburi Province, knows more than most about the risks. In his time serving in the forests along the border, he has contracted the disease twice. &quot;All the soldiers used to have malaria,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;d go home and our parents would say: &quot;What happened to you? You&apos;ve just got a common cold.&quot; But I&apos;d know it was malaria and I had to go and have a blood test. When it was positive, they&apos;d give me medication. I would feel very bad and hardly be able to walk.&quot; Nowadays, few soldiers get malaria, an improvement Sopann puts down to more clinics and better education. However, working at the checkpoint where fruit farm labourers and hundreds of others come to renew their border passes each week, he worries that Cambodian migrant workers may not be as knowledgeable and could be\u00a0at risk. &quot;It&apos;s very important for the border guards to play a role in containment,&quot; he says, &quot;but the problem is the language barrier. We cannot speak\u00a0Khmer.&quot; However, for Praphan Boonma, director of the district malaria programme, who comes to do spot tests on the migrants and recently found 20 cases of Plasmodium vivax (the region&apos;s predominant, less deadly strain) here, Sopann and his colleagues already play a vital role. &quot;It can be very difficult to get the workers tested,&quot; he says. &quot;But if they come to a checkpoint with soldiers they are afraid that they will not get a visa, so then they agree.&quot; AM Ann Morgan&apos;s assignment in Thailand was hosted by Malaria Consortium", "publicationDate": "2010-11-22T00:01:06Z", "tags": ["Professional Supplement 2009", "Professional winners 2010"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/journalismcompetition/drive-to-beat-malaria-thailand", "title": "International development journalism: Who will fund the drive to beat malaria in Thailand?", "sentences": ["Radical approaches Yet, for Professor Nicholas White of Bangkok&apos;s Mahidol-Oxford Research Unit, containment is not enough.", "At Bangkok&apos;s Mahidol University, the dean, Professor Pratap, feels it too."]}, {"article": "Aung San Suu Kyi is to see her youngest son for the first time in 10 years after he was granted a visa to enter Burma. Kim Aris, 33, travelled from his home in London to Bangkok this month when rumours emerged of his mother&apos;s impending release, but his application for a Burmese visa was initially denied. News of the reunion came as Burma suspended several magazines that prominently covered Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s release from house arrest on 13 November. Aris is expected to arrive in Rangoon tomorrow morning, Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s lawyer, Nyan Win, told the BBC Burmese service. Aris said his mother planned to meet him at the airport in Rangoon. The pro-democracy leader, 65, has not seen Kim or her eldest son, Alexander, for about 10 years. Her husband, the Oxford University academic Michael Aris, died in the UK in 1999. While Michael was dying from cancer the junta offered to let Aung San Suu Kyi fly to the UK to see him, but she refused, guessing she would never be allowed back into the country. Eight publications in the country have been suspended by government censors after they prominently published news and photographs about Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s release. The editor of one of the privately-owned publications said the press scrutiny board cited the size of a supplementary section about Aung San Suu Kyi as a violation of regulations. The magazines had printed photos of Aung San Suu Kyi in full-colour supplements, which were used as wraparound covers when the issues were put on sale.

The report was made public last week, just before revelations that the regime had made dramatic progress in enriching uranium. It provides an insight into the techniques used by North Korea to get round UN security council sanctions that place special emphasis on hindering its ability to acquire equipment and technical know-how for nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. The sanctions were introduced in 2006 and strengthened in 2009 after Pyongyang conducted nuclear tests, launched ballistic missiles and reversed a decision to close its Yongbyon nuclear facilities. Despite such measures, the UN panel said government assessments, research papers and reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency indicated North Korea&apos;s continuing involvement in nuclear-related and ballistic missile-related activities in Iran, Syria and Burma. A simple technique for shipping out banned equipment is to lie about the cargo&apos;s contents. In February, the South African government discovered a shipment of spare parts to refurbish T-54/T-55 tanks in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The cargo originated in North Korea, went to Dalian, China where it was loaded aboard a British-flagged vessel, CGM Musca, owned by a French company, CMA CGM. The shipper was subsequently identified as Machinery Exp and Imp Corp in North Korea. After leaving Dalian, the cargo was offloaded in Malaysia and transferred to the Westerhever, a ship flying the Liberian flag chartered by a subsidiary of CMA CGM. The shipping documents listed the contents of the containers as &quot;spare parts of bulldozer&quot;. North Korea also uses aircraft to ship out weapons. In December last year, the Thai government confiscated arms and related materiel from an Ilyushin-76 aircraft that took off from North Korea and landed in Bangkok for refuelling. Air Koryo, North Korea&apos;s national carrier, described the cargo as 145 crates of &quot;mechanical parts&quot;. Thai officials, however, discovered 240mm rockets, rocket-propelled grenades and surface-to-air missiles among the 35 tonnes of weapons. The UN report indicated this is may be just the tip of the iceberg. &quot;There is no way of determining how many other illicit arms transactions may have gone undetected,&quot; the report said. &quot;However, based on the cases notified to the committee so far, the panel of experts believes that the Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea continues to engage in exporting such items.&quot; The panel, however, said it had received no reports from member states on nuclear-related and ballistic missile-related systems. &quot;It may be that no interdiction has taken place with regard to such items; or it may be that reports have not been submitted owing to their sensitivity. In either case, a better understanding of the reason for non-reporting would be useful.&quot; That assessment takes on a particular resonance after Siegfried Hecker, a Stanford university professor was shown North Korea&apos;s uranium enrichment plant at Yongbyon. He said it contained an &quot;astonishingly modern control room&quot; overlooking 2,000 centrifuges. The speed with which the plant appears to have been built and its sophistication suggest outside help, at least in acquiring parts. As to why North Korea persists in pursuing a nuclear programme despite international condemnation, the UN panel of experts concluded: &quot;The Democratic People&apos;s Republic of Korea believes that its nuclear programme can provide the country [with] a way to achieve its stated goal of becoming a &apos;strong and prosperous country&apos; by the year 2012 without succumbing to what they view as &apos;foreign influences&apos;. They also consider their nuclear capability as a valuable asset that provides them with important leverage in dealing with the rest of the world.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-11-23T09:38:28Z", "tags": ["North Korea", "World news", "Nuclear weapons", "United Nations", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/23/north-korea-avoids-un-sanctions", "title": "North Korea avoiding sanctions to trade arms, warns UN", "sentences": ["In December last year, the Thai government confiscated arms and related materiel from an Ilyushin-76 aircraft that took off from North Korea and landed in Bangkok for refuelling."]}, {"article": "The discovery of more than 2,000 foetuses stored at a Bangkok temple has made front-page news across Thailand. As most abortion is illegal in Thailand, the case has shone a spotlight on a massive backstreet industry and sparked national debate about the country&apos;s current abortion laws, which date from the 1950s. With abortion routinely recognised as a &quot;sin&quot; in Theravada Buddhism, religion has played a significant social and political role in this debate. The undertaker at Wat Phai Ngern is accused of accepting regular deliveries of foetuses in plastic bags from an intermediary, who was paid by clinics to dispose of them discreetly. Buddhist temples are often used to store bodies prior to cremation but, with the local crematorium out of order, complaints about the smell led to the discovery of the operation. The bags are thought to have come from up to 20 different locations, sparking a crackdown on 3,900 suspected illegal clinics nationwide. In 1993 the Thai health ministry estimated there were 80,000 illegal abortions a year. An earlier study suggested the total was closer to 300,000. In urban areas doctors are responsible for many of the illegal abortions by providing them for congenital disorders and HIV infections. This is despite the fact the law only permits abortions in cases of rape or physical risk to the woman&apos;s health. Illegality means that medical standards remain low \u2013 a study in 1993 found that over 1% of women attending regional hospital for illegal abortions subsequently died due to complications. Theravada Buddhism in Thailand is a socially conservative force. About 95% of the population are Buddhist and Buddhism remains closely tied to the state. Sociologist James Hughes explains that most eastern Buddhist commentators, through an acceptance of karmic rebirth, believe consciousness begins at conception. Therefore, &quot;all abortion incurs the karmic burden of killing&quot;. While some monks such as Phra Thepwethi believe in a &quot;middle way&quot; (which regards abortion as a sin, but sometimes as the best option) the framing of abortion in terms of sin still has a significant cultural influence. A survey of women who had had abortions found that more than half were fearful of community exposure and a third worried that they would suffer bad karma. Andrea Whittaker, in her book, Abortion, Sin and the State in Thailand also explains that &quot;fear of bap (sin) is the most common reason given by women with unplanned pregnancies for why they didn&apos;t abort&quot;. Thai Buddhism has also had a key political role in maintaining current abortion laws, which have remained unchanged since 1956. Public discussions on reform began in the 1970s and culminated in 1981 by passing of amendment in the House of Representatives. This proposed widening the legality of abortion to include considerations of mental wellbeing, congenital abnormalities and some cases of contraceptive failure. However, Major General Chamlong Srimuang mobilised a powerful religious coalition to successfully lobby against the amendment. Chamlong&apos;s intervention marked a more overt role for Buddhism in politics. He is a member of the Buddhist movement Santi Asoke, whose founder, Phra Phothirak, challenged the idea that Thai monks should not comment on contemporary social issues. Phothirak believed that monks had a duty to speak out to oppose abortion as the killing of human life, arguing that &quot;those who say they are religious but who don&apos;t say anything don&apos;t know about religion or morality&quot;. The Santi Asoke sect, which broke away from the Buddhist sangha in 1989, has been described as &quot;radical Buddhism&quot; for its anti-modernist conservatism and strict monastic codes. Chamlong, now a leading political figure, is responsible for the political wing of the Santi Asoke movement. For these followers, abortion is linked to the influence of western promiscuity and is &quot;un-Buddhist, anti-religious and therefore un-Thai&quot;. Members from the mainstream Buddhist sanga also continue to oppose the liberalisation of abortion laws. After a conference in 2006 where NGOs called for the wider legalisation of abortion, a monk named Phra Mahamanoj responded: &quot;We Buddhists \u2026 firmly disagree with legal abortion and the destruction of life. If you don&apos;t want something to happen, don&apos;t do it.&quot; Following the recent temple discovery, leading monks have again been speaking out. Phramaha Vudhijaya Vajiramedhi was unequivocal: &quot;In [the] Buddhist view, both having an abortion and performing an abortion amount to murder. Those involved in abortions will face distress in both this life and the next because their sins will follow them.&quot; The scandal has given momentum to calls for political reform. A Democrat MP has proposed a bill on &quot;consensual and necessary abortions&quot;, which would liberalise current laws. This has been supported by Maytinee Bhongsvej, of the Association for the Promotion of the Status of Women (APSW), but she believes that change will be difficult to implement. &quot;People&apos;s attitudes are the major obstacle. For Thai society, abortion is a sin,&quot; she says. The prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, has ruled out any legal changes, saying that the current laws are &quot;good enough&quot;. Thai advocacy groups like Women&apos;s Health Advocacy Foundation point out that liberalising abortion laws would be in line with public opinion, would align the law more closely with the realities of current abortion provision and would also significantly reduce preventable medical complications. However, any reform must contend with Theravada Buddhism \u2013 which, with its integral part in political and social structures, retains a significant influence over the debate on abortion in Thailand.", "publicationDate": "2010-11-25T11:04:00Z", "tags": ["Abortion", "Buddhism", "Thailand", "Health", "Women", "Religion", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/25/abortion-reform-buddhism-thailand", "title": "Abortion reform is up against Buddhism in Thailand | Andrew Chambers", "sentences": ["The discovery of more than 2,000 foetuses stored at a Bangkok temple has made front-page news across Thailand."]}, {"article": "What better way to start a business than to stake out one of the biggest industries in the world?

Founded in early 2007, WhatClinic is nestled in a new office near Trinity College, has 10 staff and has raised two rounds of funding totalling \u20ac1.5m. Around 100,000 clinics are listed, in English, with 1,000 paying for enhanced listings. Markets in the US, UK and Ireland are particularly strong and King says the company is at break even level with projections looking good. It&apos;s an example of the Irish knack of spotting a good niche, says King. &quot;The unique thing about our startup companies is that they really get niches,&quot; he said. &quot;They can identify and tackle those very quickly - on a Friday night in the pub spot they&apos;ll spot it, the next Friday they&apos;ll have built it and the Friday after that they&apos;ll be on the phone selling it. The Friday after that they might have realised it&apos;s a crap idea, but they&apos;ll do it again, and quickly.&quot; Dublin also challenges London for its mobile expertise, says King, and gaming is very strong too.  \u2022 How are you surviving the economic crisis?&quot;We&apos;ve been externally focused from day one. Our first dollar came from Belgium, the next somewhere else - not from Ireland. It makes investment tougher to get but on a\u00a0 day to day operating level, there&apos;s no negative impact at all. I&apos;m hesitant to say it&apos;s a good thing, but three or four years ago when there was a house price boom it was very difficult to attract good talent to a startup company. Now the cost of setting up a startup company is small - \u20ac200,000 is enough to get you out of the traps and see if your idea is ready to go. Not for scaling your business, but getting the idea out there and then going for more funding based on that traction. You can get a company going very cheaply now - you don&apos;t need servers, development environments are free and you can build an application in three months.&quot;\u2022 Has being part of the Eurozone been an advantage?&quot;It&apos;s a clear advantge. It makes doing business across boundaries so much clearer. You&apos;ve no currency fluctuations, no banking issues. A disadvantage is that Ireland is small so getting a critical mass of skill can be difficult to achieve. If we need to recruit, what company in Ireland has the experience we need? There is simply no natural company for us to recruit from, whereas if we were in Silicon Valley there would be a proliferation of healthcare companies we could tap into.&quot;  \u2022 Will you stay based in Ireland as your company grows?&quot;US domination is not particularly on the cards for this comapny. If we were going to go after the US marketplace Silicon Valley would be a consideration, but the natural next marketplace for us is central and southern America. There&apos;s no question we&apos;d maintain the corporate headquarters here but have regional offices there. There&apos;s no particularly centre of gravity to what we do so no need to leave.&quot; whatclinic.com", "publicationDate": "2010-11-25T11:14:24Z", "tags": ["Technology startups", "Media", "Digital media", "Technology", "Ireland", "Entrepreneurs", "Business", "Europe", "Private healthcare"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2010/nov/25/ireland-startup-whatclinic-health", "title": "Irish tech startups: WhatClinic aggregates $6tn of private healthcare", "sentences": ["From new teeth in Budapest to a tummy tuck in Bangkok - WhatClinic wants to be the first port of call for &apos;medical tourists&apos;."]}, {"article": "Thailand Thirteen years on from the Asian financial crisis, it seems there is nothing that can stop the Thai economy: not violent protests on the streets of Bangkok, not crippling floods, not regulatory concerns over the country&apos;s largest industrial zone. Thailand&apos;s economy, south-east Asia&apos;s second-largest, is predicted to grow 7.9% this year, on the back of booming exports. In 1997, the picture was very different. The Asian Financial Crisis started in Thailand, and its was the economy to fall furthest. The stock market dropped 75%. The crisis was sparked by a collapse in the value of the Thai baht, and a disastrous currency float, which exposed an economy overstretched by real estate and foreign debt. In June of 1997, $1USD was worth 25 Thai baht. Six months later, that same dollar bought 54 baht. In August 1997, Thailand accepted a $17.2bn bailout from the IMF, subject to a number of conditions. A year after the crash, only 35 out of 91 finance and securities companies were left in Thailand. Hundreds of senior executives were fired, and the shares of the companies that remained were decreased to 1/1000th of their value. Some 1.8m jobs were lost, and half a million foreign workers left the country. But according to Dr Bhanupong Nidhiprabha, Associate Professor of Economics at Bangkok&apos;s Thammasat University, Thailand had two distinct advantages to help it fight back: its own (then seriously depressed) currency, which boosted export demand, and a growing worldwide market. &quot;The rest of the world were all expanding their economies, so we were able to export our way out of recession. I don&apos;t know if it will be so easy for Ireland.&quot; Ben Doherty, Bangkok Russia A fall in global commodities prices \u2013 in particular, oil and gas \u2013 was a key reason Russia defaulted on its domestic debt in 1998. The Asian financial crisis the previous year had sent shockwaves around the world. Russia, so dependent on hydrocarbons, metals and timber, went tumbling. A gaping budget deficit compounded the problem. The president, Boris Yeltsin, had boosted federal spending to gain political support, while cutting taxes for regional leaders and big businessmen. Foreign debt soared. On the edge of an abyss, the government fought to survive with a flurry of bond issues at ever increasing interest rates, finally provoking the crash in August. The results were dramatic. Almost all private banks imploded. The rouble was devalued by 75%. Millions of people lost their savings, wages went unpaid for months, and food shortages \u2013 so familiar from the years of perestroika \u2013 came back to haunt the population. Yet the crash of 1998 also provided Russia a positive stimulus. &quot;As it turned out,&quot; said Anton Danilov-Danilian, who headed the economics department of the presidential administration at the time of the crash, &quot;the economy only started to develop after the exchange rate was radically lowered, and our industry immediately got an advantage over importers.&quot; A rise in oil prices from 1999 onwards aided the recovery, but it was not only luck, says Chris Weafer, a strategist at Uralsib investment bank in Moscow. &quot;There is a parallel with the Irish story in that there was only one solution. Ireland recognises the only thing it can do now is to hang on to low tax rates. In Russia, the government understood it had to force repairs in the oil industry, stop transfer pricing and reverse the decline in production.&quot; Tom Parfitt, Moscow Brazil April 2009 was a good month for Brazil&apos;s uber-popular president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. At the G20 summit in London, he was greeted by his North American counterpart Barack Obama with a bear hug and a new nickname: &quot;The man.&quot; Then president Lula announced that his country would lend some $10bn to the International Monetary Fund, a further signal, he said, of Brazil&apos;s growing importance on the world stage. It was a dramatic turnaround for Brazil. In November 1998, the country had been forced to accept a $41.5bn rescue package from the IMF, after economic crises in Asia and Russia made tatters of Brazil&apos;s economy and sent foreign investors running for cover. Raphael Martello, an economist from the Sao Paulo consultancy Tendencias, said few could have foreseen Brazil&apos;s capacity to &quot;turn the tables&quot; so quickly. &quot;We have gone from debtor to creditor. Today we are loaning to the IMF. Back then nobody would have predicted this,&quot; he said. Brazil&apos;s ascent to booming Bric power is the story of a decade-long commitment to orthodox economic policy, a growing commodities boom and, more recently, massive government investment that helped pull the country through the latest global slump. Moves to allow Brazil&apos;s currency, the real, to float against the dollar in 1999, had been crucial to recovery, Martello said. &quot;This was key for all of the benefits that came after,&quot; he said. &quot;We would have needed much more help if we had kept the fixed exchange rate.&quot; It was not all plain sailing, though. On the eve of president Lula&apos;s 2002 election, markets began fretting once again over Brazil&apos;s commitment to austerity rules. There were fears there could be a very strong rupture in economic policy, or even a default on the IMF debt,&quot; Martello said. &quot;But when Lula put his economic team in place, he began gaining trust and pushing away these fears.&quot; Tom Phillips, Belo Horizonte Argentina The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday 1 December 2010  An occasional offender made an appearance below when we said: &quot;Argentina emerged from its economic wreckage by flaunting IMF guidelines&quot;. That should have been flouting, meaning to scoff at or show disregard for.   Over the last seven years, Argentina has enjoyed its longest economic bonanza since the end of the second world war. This is doubly startling because it followed an economic crash in 2001-2002 which called into question the economic survival of the nation. By the end of 2001, Argentina had descended into a dark economic hole that many observers believed it would take decades to crawl back out of. The country had defaulted on its vast foreign debt, the national currency was devalued from one peso to the dollar to four practically overnight, and banks had closed their doors to the public, impounding the life savings of almost the entire middle class. Giant barter centres where no cash or credit changed hands sprouted up overnight, with home-baked cakes or second-hand clothes exchanged for basic services such as haircuts or medical consultations. Close to half the population fell below the poverty line as a series of five presidents replaced each other in rapid succession. Yet seven years later, Argentina&apos;s economy is flourishing. A new entrepreneurial spirit has made it competitive in vibrant areas such as software, design and scientific research, all buoyed by soy exports to new markets such as China. Argentina emerged from its economic wreckage by flaunting IMF guidelines. Former President Nestor Kirchner, who won the 2003 elections, was able to pay off the country&apos;s debt to the IMF in a bold move that allowed him to apply his own brand of growth, fuelled by spending, without abiding by IMF constraints at all. But Argentina has still paid a heavy price for its descent into economic chaos. Although poverty indices have improved, the gap between rich and poor has grown, corruption is still rife, and inflation is a dark menace on an otherwise bright horizon. Uki Goni, Buenos Aires Iceland When the global financial system went into meltdown in October 2008, Iceland&apos;s three biggest banks \u2013 Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir \u2013 were 12 times bigger than the country&apos;s economy. Their fortunes were dangerously linked because each had loaned vast amounts of cash to purchase shares in the other banks. In most cases the only collateral for those loans were the shares themselves. When one bank failed, a large share of the collateral held by the others became worthless. In 2008, the banks started to run out of cash, and Glitnir was forced to turned to the Central Bank for a loan. It refused and instead took a 75% stake in Glitnir, prompting a domino-effect on the other banks. Emergency laws were passed, the Icelandic krona plummeted, and by the end of 2008 national debt had hit 240% of GDP. Iceland was forced to go to the IMF, which provided a $2.1bn loan to be repaid in instalments. The IMF programme has now been revised three times, and is due to end in late 2011. Iceland&apos;s recovery is slow but gradual. Capital controls have been put in place to back up the currency, which has strengthened by 11.5% this year. After three years of economic decline, growth of 2% is forecast for next year. The process, however, has not been painless. The IMF-programme has required massive budget cuts, that equalled 7.5% of GDP in 2009-2011. Tax-hikes have hit the pockets of Icelanders and public services.

As a commercial artist, designer and photographer, he produced a plethora of album sleeves and videos for artists including Pink Floyd, Paul McCartney, Peter Gabriel and Rage Against the Machine, as well as hundreds of television commercials. But he was also one of the most original and influential musicians of the post-punk era, initially as part of the band Throbbing Gristle, whose taboo-probing, blackly comic, defiantly non-commercial approach mirrored the other side of Christopherson&apos;s work. Occasionally, the two worlds collided, as when he attempted to convince McCartney that his album Tug of War should have a cover depicting a naked male body hanging from a noose; the former Beatle declined. More often, they fed into each other in more subtle ways. A man who delighted in subversion, Christopherson was tickled by the notion that the money he made from directing commercials, such as a floral, soft-focus ad for Max Factor&apos;s Le Jardin perfume starring Jane Seymour, enabled his post-Throbbing Gristle band Coil to make records called things such as The Anal Staircase and His Body Was a Playground for the Nazi Elite. He was born in Leeds into what he described as a &quot;large academic family&quot;: his father, Derman, was a professor of engineering who later became master of Magdalene College, Cambridge, and received a knighthood. After taking his A-levels, Peter went to study computer programming, theatre design and video at the State University of New York at Buffalo. While there he became interested in the work of radical performance artists such as Chris Burden, photographers, including Robert Mapplethorpe, and the surrealist Arthur Tress. Although the subject matter of Christopherson&apos;s photography \u2013 usually boy models with simulated injuries \u2013 was considered too shocking for publication, their technical quality earned him a job with Hipgnosis, the design team best known for producing Pink Floyd&apos;s album sleeves, on his return to England in 1974. They also impressed Genesis P-Orridge and Cosey Fanni Tutti of the transgressive performance art group COUM Transmissions, who Christopherson met at an event in Kennington, south London, the same year. Such was Christopherson&apos;s enthusiasm for the sexual aspects of COUM&apos;s performances, which often featured nudity and self-mutilation, and took inspiration from Tutti&apos;s &quot;day job&quot; as a pornographic model and stripper \u2013 that the pair affectionately called him Sleazy, a nickname that stuck. He began participating in their performances the following year, while continuing to design album sleeves and work as a photographer. In the latter capacity, one of his clients was a then-unknown band called the Sex Pistols, who Christopherson shot in the toilets of a YMCA, styled as rent boys, an image rejected as too shocking by their manager, Malcolm McLaren. McLaren&apos;s reaction prefigured the response of the punk movement to Throbbing Gristle, the musical project Christopherson, P-Orridge and Tutti embarked on in 1975 with Chris Carter, a sound engineer and electronics enthusiast who built his own synthesizers. Throbbing Gristle&apos;s sound and subject matter proved too provocative and confrontational, even in the provocative and confrontational climate of punk. At first, they dealt in unsettling grey noise underpinned with clanking electronic rhythms and lyrics betraying a fascination with serial killers, fascism, sadism and death. They dubbed their sound &quot;industrial music&quot;, and upset not only the kind of people who found punk rock offensive \u2013 a 1976 Throbbing Gristle performance at the London&apos;s Institute of Contemporary Arts led the Conservative MP Nicholas Fairbairn to call them &quot;the wreckers of civilisation&quot; \u2013 but punk audiences, too. Their 1976 debut album, The Second Annual Report, included a recording of a compere at a Brighton gig berating the audience who had just booed the band offstage. As their sound developed, eventually encompassing everything from deceptively sweet synth-pop to eerie ambient collages, Throbbing Gristle not only found an audience, but became vastly influential. They were pioneers in technology \u2013 Christopherson played a sampler that Carter had built years before sampling became commonplace. &quot;Industrial music&quot; became a genre in its own right: in the hands of Nine Inch Nails, with whose leader, Trent Reznor, Christopherson later collaborated, it even sold 10m albums. Their electronic experiments proved a pivotal influence on techno, while almost every radical idea the quartet had eventually became assimilated into mainstream rock. After Throbbing Gristle&apos;s split in 1981, Christopherson went on to form the surprisingly melodic Psychic TV with Genesis P-Orridge, then Coil, with his partner Geoff Rushton, a Throbbing Gristle fan who became known as John Balance. Their sound ranged from &quot;ritual music for the accumulation of male sexual energy&quot; involving gongs and bullroarers, to their own take on house music, their tracks always rich in complex religious and sexual symbolism. Coil continued pushing at taboos, although from a more explicitly gay perspective. In their hands, Tainted Love (1985) became an agonised howl at the Aids pandemic: it was among the first records to address the subject, while Christopherson&apos;s video remains on permanent display at New York&apos;s Museum of Modern Art. Rushton, who struggled with alcoholism, died in 2004 in a fall at his London home, bringing Coil to an end. Christopherson subsequently moved to Bangkok, participated in a successful Throbbing Gristle reunion and started another musical project, the Threshold HouseBoys&apos; Choir. True to form, one promoter who staged a concert by the latter later described it as &quot;easily the most shocking thing I have ever experienced&quot;. At the time of his death, Christopherson was working on the latest Throbbing Gristle project, a complete re-working of Nico&apos;s 1970 album Desertshore. \u2022 Peter Martin Christopherson, musician, video director and designer, born 27 February 1955; died 25 November 2010", "publicationDate": "2010-11-28T18:21:00Z", "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Punk", "Sex Pistols", "Music", "Design", "Photography", "Culture", "Advertising"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/28/peter-christopherson-obituary", "title": "Peter Christopherson obituary", "sentences": ["Christopherson subsequently moved to Bangkok, participated in a successful Throbbing Gristle reunion and started another musical project, the Threshold HouseBoys&apos; Choir."]}, {"article": "Few of even his closest friends would ever describe the Queen&apos;s second son as Prince Charming. Prince Andrew does brusque, blunt and boorish, but very rarely charming, especially to those in inferior social positions to himself and to journalists \u2013 even those who go to interview him about his mission as Britain&apos;s special representative for international trade. It is an occupation that takes the Duke of York around the world at taxpayers&apos; expense and often by the most expensive form of transport. Not that public criticism, or the nickname Airmiles Andy, ever deters him from taking the next privately chartered jet, or helicopter to lift him over the traffic to a golf club. &quot;It&apos;s not the quickest way \u2013 it&apos;s the most cost-effective and sensible way to use the time I have available. I probably use the helicopter less than other members of the royal family,&quot; he told the Daily Telegraph last year after taking a \u00a32,000 helicopter flight from Windsor to Deal and back so he could spend an hour at a golf club party. Not that such jaunts are the most expensive. Last year, according to the royal public finances annual report, which details the costs of official journeys costing \u00a310,000 or more, there was the chartered jet for the four-day trade visit to Algeria and Tunisia that cost \u00a354,869, and the seven-day round trip that took in Canada and Baku for \u00a394,500, or the return trip to Jeddah costing \u00a328,767, or the Singapore-Hanoi-Bangkok charter for \u00a346,264, or the trip to Moscow for \u00a320,083, or the \u00a362,092 for a four-day charter flight to Mexico and Panama, not to mention the \u00a343,989 it cost to get him from Mumbai to Delhi and Kolkata. Or for that matter, the \u00a311,148 to whisk him from Prestwick airport to Inverness and then down to the golf links at Dundonald in Ayrshire to attend the Duke of York&apos;s Young Champions trophy. He was batting for Britain again last week, accompanying his parents on their official visit to the Gulf. In September he was in China, and he has also been to Australia, central Asia, Malaysia, South America, the US and Italy this year. &quot;If you are a public figure you have to accept the rough with the smooth. The trouble with that particular tag [Airmiles Andy] is that, personally, I would not choose to do as many of these [foreign visits] but I am doing them because over the nine years in the job, the number of people who wish to be helped has increased, almost exponentially, through the recognition by businesses of where I can deliver,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s not only about increasing the opportunities for British businesses overseas. It is also about [supporting] business generally within the UK.&quot; The prince, fourth in line to the throne, who passed his 50th birthday in February and spent 22 years in the Royal Navy, some of that time as a helicopter pilot, has been dogged by controversy and scathing headlines from a media which clearly does not appreciate his worth. Once he was known as Randy Andy (&quot;the press want something that rhymes \u2026 if you are in a public position, as I am, you are going to get stones thrown&quot;); then there was the short-lived but ill-starred marriage to Sarah Ferguson. She at least remains loyal: &quot;Andrew is a great man and a thoroughly good person ... he&apos;s a model boy. He doesn&apos;t drink, he goes to bed early,&quot; she told the Belfast Telegraph in December 2008. Business organisations like him too. His official website bears testimony to their encomiums. They say he is diligent and well-briefed, although \u2013 more privately \u2013 some speak of a tendency to harangue them about things he has only just found out, but which they have known for years. Andy Scott, the CBI&apos;s director of international and UK operations, said: &quot;He is a good ambassador representing the UK. The royal family connection is very helpful. In a market such as China the presence of someone of his stature really counts.&quot; And yet, in recent years, the repeated, graceless remarks. He probably thinks of them as an attempt to emulate his father, although he lacks the Duke of Edinburgh&apos;s frustrated intelligence, wit or strange ethereal charm. Thus, there was the attempt to lecture America on its imperial shortcomings \u2013 &quot;those in responsible positions in the US should have listened to the British and learned from our experiences as a colonial power&quot;, he said in 2008, shortly before embarking on a trade tour (by private jet) to woo Republican businessmen in the deep south. And then there was his assertion last year that bankers should not be demonised because &quot;bonuses in the scheme of things are minute&quot;. Or, just a few weeks ago, castigating the Ministry of Defence for &quot;sitting on their fat backsides&quot; by insisting on additional safety checks on the armoured vehicles made by a Dorset firm he was visiting. So his remarks in Kyrgyzstan are just par for the course. &quot;You have to take the bashes with the good bits and I&apos;ve got a thick skin,&quot; he told CNN. Palace observers believe that the duke may be embarrassed by his lack of wealth compared with those he visits in the Middle East and former Soviet republics in the hope of boosting trade with Britain. Andrew receives an annuity of about \u00a3250,000 a year from the Queen and the cost of his official trips is borne by the taxpayer. There were more than 600 trade-related engagements in Britain and abroad in 2008 and he visited more than 20 countries. Expenses averaged \u00a34,000 a week. &quot;I&apos;d love to be able to say I&apos;ve been responsible for \u00a310bn of business or for another 250 jobs coming to the UK [but sometimes] the companies themselves don&apos;t know,&quot; he told the Financial Times last year. &quot;I get paid nothing ... That&apos;s my life. That&apos;s what I expect, right? That is because of who I am ... &quot;So to me this state of affairs is not extraordinary. To anybody else who looks in, they think I&apos;m bloody mad.

Diplomats in Bangkok alleged in cables released by WikiLeaks that Bout&apos;s &quot;Russian supporters&quot; had paid witnesses to give false testimony during his extradition hearing. Dubbed the &quot;merchant of death&quot;, Bout was seized by the Thai authorities in March 2008 but only extradited to the US on 16 November this year. The US accuses him of conspiring to sell millions of dollars of weapons to Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) rebels to kill Americans. The Kremlin strongly opposed his extradition. The Russian businessman, accused of running arms-trafficking networks around the world, maintains he is innocent in a case that turned into an undignified tug-of-war between Washington and Moscow. In a cable written on 13 February 2009, US diplomats said that in the year after Bout&apos;s arrest, extradition proceedings in Thailand were &quot;going in the way we want&quot; \u2013 albeit at a &quot;painfully slow&quot; pace. More recently, however, the case had taken a worryingly wrong turn: &quot;There have been disturbing indications that Bout&apos;s ... and Russian supporters have been using money and influence in an attempt to block extradition,&quot; the diplomats reported. Bout&apos;s claim was that he had flown to Thailand on official government business. American agents posing as Farc rebels arrested him in a sting operation in a Bangkok hotel after he allegedly agreed to sell them millions of dollars of weapons. On 12 February 2009, the US ambassador in Bangkok, Eric John, raised his concerns about the case in a meeting with Thailand&apos;s prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva. He warned that the extraditions proceedings had become &quot;tainted as a result of the efforts by Bout&apos;s associates to bribe Thai officials&quot;. John said the Americans had uncovered several examples of influence and corruption. These included the false testimony by a witness, an attempt to procure the personal secretary of the crown prince of Thailand to testify on Bout&apos;s behalf, and &quot;evidence of bribery schemes gathered throughout the world&quot;. Abhisit gave a noncommittal response, promising to examine any irregularities. In August 2009, the judge ruled Bout could not be extradited in a stunning setback to the US embassy and its &quot;Bout team&quot;. The ruling \u2013 appealed against by the US \u2013 prompted John to write a cable urging US President Barack Obama to telephone Abhisit and initiate &quot;a serious discussion of our concerns over the implications of the Bout verdict&quot;. &quot;We believe Potus [president of the US] involvement on Bout would have a significant effect here,&quot; he pleaded. The ambassador suggested a gambit to shame Moscow if Bout was freed to go back to Russia. &quot;We should consider asking the Russians to prosecute Bout if, in the end, he walks here in Thailand. At the very least perhaps we could force the Russians to publicly refuse to do so.&quot; Other cables reveal that Bout&apos;s fleet of aircraft \u2013 allegedly used to deliver arms to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Congo \u2013 are currently rusting at an airstrip in the United Arab Emirates. On 7 January 2010, the US consulate reported several of his Soviet cargo planes were stuck at the &quot;sleepy&quot; Ras al-Khaimah (RAK) airport. &quot;The airport is also working to distance itself from its reputation as a transport facilitator for clients such as international arms trafficker Viktor Bout, who used the RAK airport as a base of operations. The Wing Air aircraft once linked to Viktor Bout are grounded and effectively abandoned,&quot; it said. Another cable chronicled the unstoppable rise in Russia&apos;s international arms sales \u2013 up from $6.7bn (\u00a34.3m) in 2006 to at least $8bn in 2007. It said Moscow exported large quantities of weapons to, among others, Iran, Syria and Venezuela, and was prepared to entertain the &quot;grandiose regional visions&quot; of Venezuela&apos;s president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. The then US ambassador in Moscow, William Burns, admitted that Russia was unwilling to establish &quot;an expert-level dialogue on arms sales&quot; with Washington and was &quot;deeply cynical&quot; about any US attempts to curb Russian arms exports. &quot;Russia attaches importance to the volume of the arms export trade, to the diplomatic doors that weapon sales open, to the ill-gotten gains that these sales reap for corrupt senior officials and to the lever it provides the Russian government in stymieing American interests.&quot; On this topic the US had few instruments of persuasion, Burns added: &quot;Russian officialdom and the public have little, if any, moral compunction about the arms trade, seeing it instead as a welcome symbol of Russia&apos;s resurgent power and strength in the world.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2010-12-01T21:30:22Z", "tags": ["Arms trade", "Russia", "The US embassy cables", "Thailand", "US national security", "World news", "US news", "US foreign policy", "Viktor Bout", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/01/wikileaks-cables-viktor-bout-extradition", "title": "WikiLeaks cables allege Russia bribed Viktor Bout witnesses", "sentences": ["Diplomats in Bangkok alleged in cables released by WikiLeaks that Bout&apos;s &quot;Russian supporters&quot; had paid witnesses to give false testimony during his extradition hearing.", "American agents posing as Farc rebels arrested him in a sting operation in a Bangkok hotel after he allegedly agreed to sell them millions of dollars of weapons.", "On 12 February 2009, the US ambassador in Bangkok, Eric John, raised his concerns about the case in a meeting with Thailand&apos;s prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva."]}, {"article": "Friday, 04 December 2009, 08:28C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 BANGKOK 003066 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 11/25/2019 TAGS PREL, PHUM, PGOV, RU, TH SUBJECT: RUSSIA LOOKS TO REINVIGORATE BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH THAILAND, AGAINBANGKOK 00003066 001.2 OF 005Classified By: DCM James F. Entwistle, reasons 1.4 (b) &amp; (d) 1. (C) Summary: The Thai-Russia bilateral relationship blossomed earlier this decade after years of stagnation during the Cold War but has had little forward momentum since then, despite a November 27 visit to Bangkok by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sobyanin and Thai pledges that the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister will travel to Russia in 2010. The resurgence earlier in the decade occurred as a result of a flurry of high-level visits, first by then Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra to Russia in 2002 and a reciprocal visit by former President Vladimir Putin to Thailand in 2003. For its part, Russia has advocated the construction of a regional energy facility in Thailand to be supplied by Russia, aspired to become a dialogue partner for the East Asia Summit (EAS), and expand arms exports in Southeast Asia. Thailand enjoys a rapid expansion of Russian tourists visiting Thailand but has to deal with an unwanted side effect - the presence of Russian organized crime networks around the popular beach destinations of Pattaya and Phuket. The biggest headline grabber of 2008-09 has likely been the arrest of Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, whose extradition to the U.S. remains under review by an Appellate Court. 2. (C) Comment: The Thai-Russia bilateral relationship saw a period of re-engagement from 2002-03 during fugitive former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra&apos;s outward-looking administration (2001-06), with Thaksin pursuing possible arms purchases from Russia in barter deals to boost Thai exports of agricultural products and to lessen Thai military dependence on U.S. systems. However, since Thaksin&apos;s ouster in a bloodless coup in 2006, Thailand has primarily been inwardly focused. For his part, Thaksin has continued to travel regularly to Moscow, including a December 2-3 visit, meeting quietly with Putin. With Thailand&apos;s foreign policy centered primarily on ASEAN, the U.S., and China, there is little space for Russia to be an influential player. Putin&apos;s continued willingness to host Thaksin in Moscow--the Russian government refused to confirm the visit to the Thai Embassy in Moscow, even as Thaksin&apos;s brother was announcing it to the Thai media and Thaksin&apos;s lawyer and lieutenants were discussing freely with us--certainly will win Russia few favors with the current Thai government. 3. (C) Comment, cont: That said, there is an interesting well-spring of enduring pro-Russian sentiment among many Thai based on historical ties between the Siamese and Russian royal families: King Chulalongkorn and Tsar Nicholas II exchanged reciprocal visits in 1909-1910; and the Tsar provided what many Thai consider a critical boost to Siam&apos;s independence in the face of British and French pressure on Siam&apos;s borders and sovereignty. Queen Sirikit&apos;s 2007 State visit to Russia reminded many Thai of this century-old emotional bond. Some commentators suggest a Thai reluctance to offend Russia by extraditing Viktor Bout to the U.S., manifested in the initial August Lower Court ruling denying the extradition request, may have been grounded in part in this enduring sentiment. End Summary and Comment. Thai-Russian Bilateral Re-engagement ----------------------------------- 4. (C) 2002-03 was the seminal period for the renewal of Thai-Russia relations, Professor Kantassa Thunjitt from Thammasat University&apos;s Russian Studies Program told us recently. Despite warm relations a century ago between Imperial Russia and Siam, the relationship had been largely dormant during the Cold War era and afterwards until Thaksin made an official visit to Russia in October 2002, with Putin reciprocating in October 2003, when Thailand hosted APEC. Kantassa highlighted Putin&apos;s audience with King Bhumibol during his visit as particularly significant. Bangkok Post Senior Reporter Achara Ashayagachat told us recently that Thaksin had looked to Russia to expand market opportunities. Achara also believed that Thaksin sought to balance Thailand&apos;s relationships with both the U.S. and China through BANGKOK 00003066 002.2 OF 005 engaging Russia, while simultaneously looking at ways to maximize profits. 5. (C) While Thaksin and Putin visits prompted a flurry of diplomatic re-engagement at the most senior levels, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Department of European Affairs official Wacharin Vongvivatachaya told us that Thai-Russian relations peaked during Queen Sirikit&apos;s State visit to Russia in July 2007. During the Queen&apos;s trip, she visited Moscow and St. Petersburg, met Putin and then First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, and was deeply impressed by the Mariinsky Ballet. As a result, the RTG arranged for the Mariinsky to visit in December 2007 to perform for King Bhumibol&apos;s 80th birthday. The ballet performed once during a closed session for the King and the palace, and twice for sold out Thai audiences. Wacharin commented that these performances had led to yearly participation of Russian opera and ballet troupes at the annual September Bangkok International Festival of Dance, which the Queen has attended the past two years. 6. (SBU) The latest Russian effort to reinvigorate the bilateral relationship came November 27, with the visit of Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Sobyanin to Bangkok to meet with Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and to convene the Fourth Thai-Russian Joint Commission Meeting with FM Kasit. Sobyanin looked to increase trade and investment, signaled Russia&apos;s willingness to cooperate with Thailand in research and development in the oil and natural gas sector, and underscored Russia&apos;s desire to cooperate with Thailand on security and culture issues, according to a statement posted on the Thai MFA&apos;s website. As a sign of recent drift in Thai-Russian relations, however, the Joint Commission meeting, intended to convene every two years, came after an eight year hiatus. 7. (SBU) DPM Sobyanin also extended an invitation to Abhisit to visit Russia in early 2010, according to the MFA statement. Wacharin told us December 2 that Abhisit plans to accept this invitation and will likely travel to Moscow in the first half of next year, and that FM Kasit would separately travel to Moscow for the Fifth Joint Commission Meeting. Russia Interested in Economic Ties... ------------------------------------- 8. (SBU) After visiting Thailand for the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) Ministerial Meeting in Phuket July 22-24, and having an audience with King Bhumibol Adulyadej in Hua Hin to reaffirm Russia&apos;s historical ties with Thailand, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov delivered a keynote speech at Chulalongkorn University July 24 in which he outlined Russia&apos;s key economic goals for further cooperation and integration with the Thai economy. Lavrov highlighted Russia&apos;s eastern territories as holding natural resources -- such as oil, gas, and coal -- that could become the means to further engage with countries like Thailand. As such, one of Russia&apos;s critical goals was to promote energy cooperation between Russia and Thailand; Lavrov announced Russia&apos;s interest in developing a regional facility in Thailand for storing, processing and trading Russian oil and gas. 9. (C) MFA official Wacharin downplayed the significance of Lavrov&apos;s proposal for a regional oil facility in Thailand, explaining to us that it was currently only a Russian idea. She commented that this plan was first proposed by the Russians under Thaksin&apos;s administration; the MFA in 2008 had previously told us that then Samak government continued to push the idea, even though the Thai state-owned energy firm PTT doubted its economic viability. Wacharin stressed that the energy policy of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva&apos;s government was markedly different from that of its Thaksin-associated predecessors. She said that while the Royal Thai Government (RTG) continued to study the proposal further, there were many technical issues that needed to be reviewed, such as transportation costs. BANGKOK 00003066 003.2 OF 005 ...And a political voice in the region -------------------------------------- 10. (C) Watcharin said that the MFA viewed Russia as eager to become a major player in the Asia Pacific region. Russian Embassy diplomat Andrey Dmitrichenko told us that Russia had previously taken a more active approach in engaging ASEAN in hopes of facilitating Russian participation in the East Asian Summit (EAS) as a dialogue partner. However, Russia currently was now willing to wait, not pushing its case; Dmitrichenko suggested that it was more realistic for Russia to become a dialogue partner at the same time that the U.S. was invited to become a dialogue partner. Dmitrichenko noted that Russia had acceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC) in 2004, held an ASEAN-Russia Summit in Kuala Lumpur in 2005, and looked forward to the second ASEAN-Russia Summit in Vietnam, which would follow on the establishment of an ASEAN Center in Moscow in late 2009. 11. (C) The opinions of non-official Thais we talked to about the Russian diplomatic push was in general rather dismissive. Professor Rom Phiramontri, Director for the Center of Russian Studies at Chulalongkorn University, commented that in general Russia has had very little influence in Asia, particularly in Thailand. In his opinion, Russia was attempting to gain more influence with Thailand, geographically in the center of ASEAN, in an attempt to expand influence throughout the region, especially economically. Professor Kantassa of Thamssat similarly told us that Russia was trying to play a larger role in Southeast Asia, noting it has attempted to raise its status in the region by offering itself as an alternative to the U.S. and China. Trade, Tourism, and Organized Crime ----------------------------------- 12. (SBU) Wacharin underscored that trade and tourism were the most important elements to the Thai-Russia bilateral relationship. For Russia, Thailand was its number one trading partner in Southeast Asia with trade accounting for over $1 billion annually. (Note: U.S.-Thai trade exceeds $30 billion annually. End Note.) Wacharin stated that Russia&apos;s main exports to Thailand were rolled steel, scrap metal, fertilizers, unprocessed minerals, synthetic rubber, diamonds, pulp, and paper. Thailand&apos;s main exports to Russia were sugar, rice, gems, clothes, shoes, canned food, and furniture. Thailand&apos;s premier multi-national, the CP Group, had invested in Russia by establishing an animal food producing factory in Moscow&apos;s suburbs, Wacharin added, though there has been little Russian investment in Thailand, mainly in small businesses. 13. (SBU) Wacharin commented that the number of Russian tourists to Thailand had steadily increased, to 300,000 Russians in 2008. Thailand was the number two destination in Asia for Russian tourists, who did not need visas for short visits. The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) reported that as of October 2009, six direct scheduled weekly flights are being operated between Moscow and Bangkok by Thai Airways International and Aeroflot Russian Airlines. While traditionally the main destination for Russian tourists was Pattaya, leading to Russia establishing a Honorary Consul covering Pattaya, Rayong, and Chonburi on the eastern seaboard, in the past several years Russians had started flocking to the up-market resorts on Phuket on the Andaman coast in large numbers, where a second honorary consulate has been established. 14. (C) Russian organized crime circles established a presence in Thailand in the 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union. A number of U.S. law enforcement agencies are involved in investigating or monitoring cases involving Russian organized crime in Thailand in cooperation with Thai partners, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the BANGKOK 00003066 004.2 OF 005 Department of Homeland Security&apos;s (DHS) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). These law enforcement agencies report that criminal networks composed of mostly Russian nationals operating in Pattaya and Phuket are responsible for the commission of numerous crimes, including extortion, money laundering, narcotics trafficking, real estate fraud, financial fraud, human smuggling, pandering, counterfeiting, document fraud, cybercrime, and illegal importation of cars. 15. (SBU) While much of the Russian organized criminal activity in Thailand has occurred quietly, three specific cases generated public awareness of the phenomenon. In April 1998, Russian restaurant owner Konstantine Povoltski was found shot dead in a car near one of his two restaurants in southern Pattaya. In August 2003, police apprehended three Russian bank robbers when their speedboat ran out of fuel after they held up the Bank of Ayudhya in South Pattaya, stole 2.4 million baht, and killed a Thai police officer in the process. Rinat Koudaiarov was sentenced to death for the shooting. In February 2007, two Russian women were found murdered on the beach of Jomtien 10 km from Pattaya, amidst speculation that it had been a Russian OC-ordered hit. Weapons for Sale ---------------- 16. (SBU) One area in which potential cooperation has not been fully realized is in military armaments. Thaksin started pursuing possible deals for Russian weapons in 2003 in exchange for debts Russia had incurred earlier in purchasing Thai rice. In 2005 Thaksin had attempted to broker a deal with Putin in which Russia would sell a dozen Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jets to Thailand in exchange for 250,000 tons of frozen poultry worth $500 million. In the end, however, the deal fell through; in October 2007, Thailand signed a $1.1 billion agreement to purchase six Saab JAS-39 Gripen jets from Sweden. Viktor Bout ----------- 17. (C) Russian arms merchant Viktor Bout was apprehended in a joint U.S.-Thai undercover DEA sting operation March 6, 2008 and remains in Thai custody. The U.S. requested extradition in order to try Bout in the Southern District of New York on a four-count indictment charging conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals and officers; acquire and use anti-aircraft missiles; and provide material support to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a designated foreign terrorist organization. The Thai lower court ruled in favor of Bout, and against extradition, on August 11, 2009, with the Thai judge stating that the FARC was engaged in a political cause, not terrorism. 18. (C) Initially, the primary publicly-known Russian interest in defending Bout came from the Russian Duma, but later, the Russian Government took a more active role in pressing Thailand not to extradite Bout. Members of Parliament (MPs) Sergey Ivanov and Vice Chairman of the Duma Vladimir Zhirinovsky have been active in supporting Bout from the beginning. Ivanov testified at Bout&apos;s trial as a defense witness, stating that if Bout were to be extradited to the U.S. it would adversely affect the Thai-Russia bilateral relationship. Zhirinovsky has picketed the Thai embassy in Moscow for Bout&apos;s release, lobbied the Thai ambassador, disrupted the Thai Ambassador during public speeches, and portrayed Bout as the victim of an anti-Russian witch hunt. The Thai DCM in Moscow, and the Thai MFA&apos;s Russian desk, have acknowledged to Embassies Moscow/Bangkok the diplomatic pressure the Russian MFA and Embassy in Bangkok have placed on Bout&apos;s behalf. 19. (C) Professor Rom told us he thought that U.S.-Thai relations would not be negatively affected over the long-term if the U.S.&apos;s appeal failed and Bout was able to return to Russia; he stressed that Thailand had already cooperated with the U.S. by apprehending Bout at U.S. request. Professor BANGKOK 00003066 005.2 OF 005 Kantassa admitted that Bout was a businessman who would sell weapons to anybody, but suggested that the Thai court would take a neutral stance between the U.S. and Russia on the extradition, a sentiment we occasionally heard from MFA contacts since Bout&apos;s arrest (Note: the August 11 Lower Court ruling rejecting the extradition certainly could not be characterized as &quot;neutral&quot;; we await the Appellate Court panel decision). 20. (SBU) Note: this cable was coordinated with Embassy Moscow.

John, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 1. (S) Summary. During a February 12 meeting, the Ambassador raised with Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva the ongoing extradition case concerning Russian international arms trafficker Viktor Bout and serious concerns that Bout&apos;s associates had been able to influence testimony given by [xxxxxxxxxx]. Abhisit told the Ambassador that he would address any &quot;irregularities&quot; in the case through &quot;appropriate channels.&quot; The Ambassador also raised USG concerns with the xxxxxxxxx testimony during a February 13 introductory call with Defense Minister Prawit Wongsuwan. Prawit committed to looking into the testimony in order to determine the truth. 2. (S) Comment. Since Viktor Bout&apos;s arrest in Bangkok almost a year ago, moving towards a successful extradition to the United States has been at the top of our bilateral agenda here. In addition to Embassy efforts over the months, President Bush raised it with then-Prime Minister Samak during his August 2008 visit to Bangkok. Overall, our sense has been that while the extradition proceedings have been painfully slow (and have required constant nurturing by our DOJ and DEA personnel every step of the way), they are moving in the direction we want. Lately, however, there have been disturbing indications that Bout&apos;s xxxxxxxxxx and Russian supporters have been using money and influence in an attempt to block extradition. The most egregious example was the false testimony of xxxxxxxxxx that Bout was in Thailand as part of government-to-government submarine deal. Thus, we felt it was time to once again raise the matter at the top of the government and make clear that, while we understand the judicial process must take its course without political interference, we insist that the process be free of corruption and undue influence. We will continue to do so in the months ahead. We understand AG Holder may soon call the Thai AG to review the case (as previous AG Mukasey did three times in addition to his visit to Bangkok last summer). Combined with our efforts this week, the call will make for an important one-two punch. End Summary and Comment. ABHISIT PROMISES TO LOOK INTO IRREGULARITIES IN BOUT CASE --------------------------------------------- ------------ 3. (S) During a February 12 meeting at the Parliament, the Ambassador raised with Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva the ongoing extradition case concerning international arms trafficker Viktor Bout. (Note: Bout faces terrorism-related charges in federal court in New York for conspiring to sell millions of dollars of weapons to the FARC for use in killing Americans. He has remained in custody in Bangkok since his arrest on March 6, 2008. End note.) The Ambassador noted that, while the U.S. and Thailand enjoy a strong extradition relationship, our countries must ensure that the bilateral extradition treaty worked in our most important cases, such as those involving terrorism. In this regard, the Ambassador emphasized to Abhisit that the extradition case against Bout is a high priority for the United States. Citing the United Nations&apos; sanctions against Bout, the Ambassador also noted that the extradition case is one of global importance. Abhisit told that Ambassador that he believed that his office had limited means to affect ongoing extradition proceedings, stating that the judicial system was designed to afford due process to the parties and expressing an unwillingness to be seen as &quot;overruling&quot; this process, or &quot;helping one side.&quot; 4. (S) Expressing growing concern about the extradition proceedings, the Ambassador then described evidence showing that the extradition proceedings against Bout have become tainted as a result of the efforts by Bout&apos;s associates to bribe Thai officials. In particular, the Ambassador detailed false testimony on Bout&apos;s behalf from xxxxxxxxxx to the effect that Bout came to Thailand to conduct official business with the Thai government relating to a submarine project; recorded statements by a Thai associate of Bout that he had procured xxxxxxxxxx to testify on Bout&apos;s behalf; evidence of bribery schemes gathered throughout the world; and a scheme to arrest and thereby embarrass two U.S. diplomats - i.e., DEA agents assigned to the Bout investigation - on meritless charges of participating in illegal recordings of Bout on the day of his arrest. If the xxxxxxxxxxxx false testimony remained unrebutted, the court could possibly deny extradition based on an erroneous conclusion that RTG had legitimate dealings with Bout, a U.N.-sanctioned arms trafficker. 5. (S) In light of this evidence, the Ambassador asked the Prime Minster to take steps to ensure that the proceedings in Bout&apos;s extradition case were free from the taint of bribery and corruption. In particular, the Ambassador suggested that testimony from an authoritative witness from the Royal Thai Navy or the Ministry of Defense should be offered to repudiate the xxxxxxxxxx statement and make clear that the RTG supports the extradition request. The Ambassador also reminded the PM of the recent case of Jamshid Ghassemi, in which the Thai authorities denied a U.S. extradition request under apparent pressure from Iran, and stressed the importance of avoiding a similar result here. (Note: Ghassemi is under indictment in San Diego for violations of the Arms Export Control Act and money laundering relating to his conspiracy to acquire accelerometers used in missile navigation. End note.) The Ambassador also stated that Thailand&apos;s failure to ensure an extradition process in Bout that is free from corruption and undue influence would constitute a major setback to the bilateral relations between the U.S. and Thailand, especially in the area of law enforcement. 6. (S) After listening to the evidence provided by the Ambassador suggesting that bribery had infected the Bout proceedings, Abhisit committed to addressing any &quot;irregularities&quot; in the extradition case through the &quot;appropriate channels.&quot; At the conclusion of the meeting, the Prime Minister sought the identity of the individuals involved in the bribery schemes, and the DOJ Attache, who accompanied the Ambassador to the meeting, supplied an aide to the PM with the requested information. DEFENSE MINISTER COMMITS TO LOOKING INTO TESTIMONY --------------------------------------------- ----- 7. (S) During a February 13 introductory call, the Ambassador highlighted to Minister of Defense Prawit Wongsuwan the importance the USG places on the Bout extradition proceedings. The Ambassador noted that the USG understood that extradition cases take time and that the USG respected the Thai judicial system, but we were concerned about efforts by Bout to improperly influence the proceedings. Of particular concern was the false testimony by xxxxxxxxx the Ambassador told Prawit. Thexxxxxxxxxx testimony was not true and, as such, it was very important that the Thai Navy or the Ministry of Defense correct this falsehood with testimony to the court. Doing so would ensure that the proceedings were kept on track and would publicly clarify that the Thai military was not associated with a U.N.-sanctioned arms trafficker. Prawit told the Ambassador that he was unfamiliar with the case but that he would give priority to looking into the issue to determine the truth regarding the testimony ofxxxxxxxxx. The Defense Minister also committed to examining a non-paper with more details on the testimony of xxxxxxxxxxx that the DOJ Attache provided to an aide to Prawit.

John, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 1. (C) Summary and comment. The disappointing August 11 Thai Lower Court ruling against the extradition of Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout, and its dubious legal reasoning, requires a multi-pronged effort to seek a successful reversal during the appeals process. The lead judge&apos;s foray into foreign policy, rejecting the terrorism label and in effect embracing the FARC&apos;s activities as purely political in nature, not criminal or acts of terrorism, has implications for Thailand. His confusion of the &quot;dual criminality&quot; concept with jurisdictional issues similarly raises questions for efforts by Thailand to extradite fugitive former PM Thaksin to face justice. The Embassy is working with Thai authorities to file an appeal of the lower court&apos;s ruling and to press home the implications of the court ruling were Bout to walk free. In the early afternoon on August 13, we were assured that the notice of intention to appeal has been filed. 2. (C) At the same time, the Embassy recommends the State Department, Attorney General Holder, and the US Mission to the UN in New York engage the Thai Ambassador in Washington and the Thai PermRep in New York in parallel. In addition, the Department should seriously consider asking Belgium, which issued an arrest warrant for Bout in 2002 for money laundering and conspiracy, Colombia, in the case of the FARC, and African countries which have suffered greatly from Bout&apos;s arms trade in the past to weigh in with the RTG. Finally, we recommend consideration of laying down a marker in Moscow about Bout, looking forward to the possibility that Bout may end up back in Russia were the appeal of the Lower Court ruling might not succeed. End Summary and comment. Thai Lower Court rules against Bout extradition --------------------------------------------- -- 3. (C) On August 11, the judge in the Viktor Bout extradition case ruled against U.S. and Thai government efforts to extradite Bout to the United States. Two key elements of his reasoning were: that the FARC in Colombia, to which Bout was conspiring to send weapons, was a political rather than a terrorist group; and that the &quot;dual criminality&quot; standard of our extradition treaty with Thailand had not been met since Bout could not be prosecuted in Thailand on the charges which the U.S. wants him to face in the U.S. In our view, the judge was wrong on both counts. 4. (C) After the verdict, as the Department has seen, the DCM spoke on the record to press outside the court room and expressed disappointment and mystification over the ruling and stated that we would fully support RTG efforts to appeal the decision. We have continued the same themes in subsequent interactions with the press. Engaging the Thai immediately ----------------------------- 5. (C) The Ambassador called Foreign Minister Kasit immediately after the verdict on August 11 and expressed deep disappointment, noting that the verdict was not justified on legal grounds and that the judge had clearly been in error on several key points. He reminded Kasit that over the past year and a half since Bout&apos;s arrest in Bangkok, the USG had repeatedly underlined the importance of the case, all the way up to the Secretary of State and POTUS levels. In the short-term, the Ambassador told Kasit, we need the Foreign Ministry to do its part in forwarding the necessary documentation to the Attorney-General&apos;s office so that the intent to appeal can be filed in the requisite forty-eight hours. (Note: Although the court&apos;s ruling and a new extradition law specify that the appeal must be filed within 72 hours, the applicable extradition law sets forth the shorter time frame, which we have followed.) Kasit assured the Ambassador that he had already instructed his legal department to do so. The Ambassador also told Kasit that we BANGKOK 00001998 002 OF 004 expected Bout would remain in detention during the appeals process. The MFA&apos;s Legal and Treaties Department faxed the Attorney General&apos;s office late evening August 11 supporting the appeal; at the request of the Office of the Attorney General, the Embassy sent a diplomatic note to the MFA and the OAG on August 13 requesting that the RTG appeal the lower court verdict prior to the forty-eight hour deadline (note: the RTG was closed August 12 for a National Holiday, the Queen&apos;s Birthday.) At approximately 1:25 p.m. on August 13, the MFA and OAG advised the Embassy that the requisite notice of intention to appeal had been filed and received by the court. Next steps ---------- 6. (C) The Embassy&apos;s &quot;Bout team&quot; met August 13 to review next steps that will help us prevail on appeal. Our immediate priority was to ensure that the notice of intent to appeal was filed on time (within 48 hours of the verdict) and that the appeal itself is filed within thirty days of the verdict. 7. (C) We will make clear to the RTG that we expect Bout to remain incarcerated during the appeals process, as specified under Thai law and the August 11 court ruling. Given that the same judge will rule on any bail motions brought by Bout (we expect Bout&apos;s attorneys to push hard on bail), however, his custody status during the pendency of the appeal is a genuine concern. We also intend to make clear to the Thai government (the Ambassador is seeking to call FM Kasit, in Malaysia August 13-14 on a working visit, and will engage the highest available MFA official in Bangkok) that we expect this deficient ruling to receive a comprehensive and meaningful review by the appellate court. Moreover, the Ambassador plans to tell Kasit and other senior Thai officials that, given that the Thai government arrested Bout and sought his extradition to the U.S., the Thai government should be as alarmed by the judge&apos;s ruling as we are. Therefore, we would encourage the RTG to issue a public statement expressing disappointment in the judge&apos;s decision, its intention to win on appeal, and a reiteration of Thailand&apos;s commitment to both the struggle against international terrorism and to its extensive law enforcement relationship with the United States. The Ambassador intends to make similar points to newly appointed NSC Secretary General Tawee and to key figures at the Palace. Without being counter-productively heavy-handed, we will make clear that we see Thai executive branch reaction to the ruling as a test of the relationship. 8. (C) At the same time, however, we believe it is important to remember that our partners in the Royal Thai Police, the Office of the Attorney General, the Foreign Ministry, and even the Royal Thai Navy, largely did everything we asked them to do on the Bout case, including going the extra mile to facilitate our requests. Our posture and actions thus should make clear that we are disappointed with the judge&apos;s ruling but not with Thai government cooperation in the Bout case. 9. (C) That said, coming on the heels of the September 2008 Thai appellate ruling affirming a lower court&apos;s denial of our request to extradite Iranian Jamshid Ghassemi, who was in Thailand to procure controlled technology in violation of the Arms Export Control Act, the question has to be asked whether we can count on the Thai courts to do the right thing on high-profile extradition cases that will affect Thailand&apos;s relations with third countries (we continue to have a perfect record on routine extraditions from Thailand to the United States). Our reluctant conclusion is that we cannot. 10. (S) The Department will recall that in February of this year, after significant indications that the Russians were trying to use bribes to influence the outcome of the case, the Ambassador made representations to Prime Minister Abhisit (reftel) that we expected the process to be free of inappropriate influence and Abhisit undertook to do so. The BANGKOK 00001998 003 OF 004 Ambassador also intervened at the same time with Defense Minister Prawit Wongsuwan and the Royal Thai Naval Commander Khamtorn Pumhiran to insist that false testimony by xxxxxxxxx (that Bout had been in Thailand as part of a routine naval procurement) be rebutted. The Thai Navy subsequently issued a letter to that effect. We will remind the Thais of their commitment to a clean process and ask that they assure us again on the front. What We are Doing here/What We Suggest Washington Do --------------------------------------------- ------- 11. (C) Given the above, we are undertaking the following steps here in Bangkok, most of which should also be reflected when the Department calls in Thai Ambassador Don Pramuwinai, a move we fully support: -- The Ambassador will immediately seek a meeting with Foreign Minister Kasit and other appropriate senior Thai officials to make clear that, while we appreciate the cooperation on Bout over the past year and a half, we are disappointed and mystified by the judge&apos;s ruling, which is flawed on several key points. -- In particular, the judge&apos;s characterization of the FARC as a legitimate political actor would suggest that insurgent groups in southern Thailand are likewise political in nature, perhaps outside the scope of Thailand&apos;s new counterterrorism laws. The ruling also suggests that anyone seeking to send them arms from a third country could not be extradited to Thailand on political grounds. -- Moreover, the judge&apos;s misguided analysis of the &quot;dual criminality&quot; standard suggests that fugitives cannot be extradited from Thailand unless a Thai court actually had jurisdiction over the alleged crime, not whether the alleged conduct is viewed as criminal conduct under the laws of both countries. This decision comes at the same time Thailand is pursuing extradition of fugitive former PM Thaksin Shinawatra for abuse of power/corruption-related charges; the judge&apos;s ruling would also seem to undermine RTG positions in their Thaksin extradition effort. -- Therefore, we expect that the AG&apos;s office will vigorously pursue the appeal of the ruling and that Bout will remain incarcerated during the pendency of the appeal. -- We seek assurances that the case will be afforded a comprehensive and meaningful appellate review, presumably handled by serious, experienced Thai judges. (Note: Appeals are normally handled by a panel of three judges. End Note.) -- We ask that the Thai government issue a statement making clear its own disappointment with the judge&apos;s ruling and reiterating its commitment to the fight against international terrorism and to the law enforcement relationship with the U.S. -- We will continue to make our points to the press and we are pulling together a &quot;FARC fact sheet&quot; for public distribution that we will send in to Washington for comment and clearance today. 12. (C) We suggest that Washington strongly consider the following actions: -- In addition to the Department calling in the Thai Ambassador, we recommend that Attorney General Holder also call him in. AG Holder could point out the extensive U.S. commitment of law enforcement resources to Thailand (DEA and other), as well as our judicial training efforts, and that a statement from the RTG as outlined above would be very helpful as the U.S. decides where best to commit its law enforcement resources around the world. A senior DEA official might also wish to sit in to highlight the massive DEA commitment to Thailand. (Note: Our DOJ Attache who has led our legal efforts on Bout here will be in Washington on August 20-21. End Note.) -- Discussion of a POTUS telcon to PM Abhisit has been under way for some time; they have not spoken in the seven months both have been in office. We suggest that the call be accelerated and that it include a serious discussion of our concerns over the implications of the Bout verdict, as outlined above. We believe POTUS involvement on Bout would have significant effect here. -- We suggest Washington engage the Colombian government on BANGKOK 00001998 004 OF 004 the implications of the Bout verdict. We suggest inquiring whether Colombia considers the FARC to be a terrorist organization, whether it would be willing to submit a brief in the appeals process, and also make public statements to that effect. We also suggest exploring whether Colombia would be willing to ask Thailand for Bout&apos;s extradition while he (hopefully) is still in detention during the appeals process. (Note: There is no Colombian Embassy in Bangkok; the Embassy in Kuala Lumpur covers Thailand. We understand the Thais cover Colombia from their Embassy in Lima. End note.) It would be useful if the Government of Colombia also raised its concerns in Moscow. -- We also suggest exploring the possibility of whether governments whose citizens have borne the bloody results of Bout&apos;s activities over the years, such as Sierra Leone, Liberia and Congo, would be willing to publicly express dismay/engage the Thai government on the verdict and whether any affected government would be willing to ask for his extradition. -- While the Bout focus is now on Thailand, this is at heart a U.S.-Russian matter. The Department may wish to make clear to Moscow our concerns on Bout&apos;s activities and seek assurances that they will cease. Also, we should consider asking the Russians to prosecute Bout if, in the end, he walks here in Thailand. At the very least perhaps we could force the Russians to publicly refuse to do so. -- The Thai ruling seems inconsistent with several United Nations determinations on Bout&apos;s nature over the years (see below). We suggest our USUN call in the Thai Permrep and lay out how we view the issues in terms of Thailand&apos;s standing with the United Nations. Better yet would be for the appropriate UN official to call in the Thai Permrep and seek an explanation of how the verdict can be justified in light of Thailand&apos;s support of relevant UN resolutions: - UNSCR 1521 (2003) - Liberia - UNSCR 1343 (March 2001) - Liberia - Report of Experts Panel under 1343 - Final Monitoring Report on Angola Sanctions (2000) -- Finally, despite the listing by the US and EU of the FARC as a terrorist organization, we understand that the FARC is not listed as such by the UN. A move to have the FARC listed formally by the UN would assist the effort to keep Bout in custody.

Knight Frank&apos;s global house price index shows the weakest region in the three months to the end of September was Europe, posting 0.8% house price growth, while Asia-Pacific was the strongest with average growth of 9.9%. For the first time since late 2008, quarterly prices increased in each of the six world regions monitored by Knight Frank (Asia-Pacific by 9.9%, Middle East by 5.1%, North America by 4.2%, South America by 3.5%, Africa by 3% and Europe by 0.8%). But annual growth in Europe ranged from 26.1% in Latvia to -13.9% in Lithuania and -14.8% in Ireland, while average house prices in the US now stand at their mid-2003 level, according to the estate agent. It said the critical driver for weaker global performance was the number of countries &quot;tipping back into negative growth&quot; in the most recent quarter, with 14 (mainly European) countries notching house price falls. Liam Bailey, head of residential research at Knight Frank, said there is now a growing gap between the less debt-afflicted European economies of Austria, France and Finland and their neighbours to the south and west of the continent, with Greece, Spain and Ireland ranking much lower in its global house price index. &quot;While a majority of countries are reporting positive annual growth, 56% saw prices fall in the third quarter this year,&quot; Bailey said. &quot;There is growing evidence that the global housing market recovery, which began in early 2009 following the desperate conditions in 2007 and 2008, may just be beginning to run out of steam. &quot;Nearly a third of countries which had experienced strengthening conditions in [early] 2010 saw quarterly price growth turn negative in the third quarter of 2010.&quot; Led by European markets, the list of countries recording average house price falls includes Greece, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia and the UK. Outside of Europe the list includes China, Canada, Colombia, Dubai, New Zealand, South Africa and Taiwan. Expensive consumer locations However, despite the global slowdown in house price inflation, homeowners and consumers must cope with the rising costs of everyday goods, according to shopping website PriceRunner. It said the cost of such items have risen internationally over the past year. It said the cheapest city in the world is Mumbai, with prices 27% below the global average, followed by Bangkok and Dubai as the second and third cheapest, with prices 19.8% and 16.2% respectively below the world average. London slipped down the list of most expensive cities in the world, from second in 2007 to eighth this year, according to the group&apos;s international price comparison survey, which compares a range of products across 32 countries. Oslo was found to be the most expensive city for the fourth successive year. In the city a can of Coke will set consumers back \u00a31.80 (56p in UK), while a litre of milk costs \u00a31.56 (80p in UK) and fast-food fans must shell out \u00a34.70 for a Big Mac (\u00a32.39 in UK). Across the 32 countries the price of some everyday purchases decreased (such as a pint of milk falling from 86p to 81p, and a can of Coke dropping from 75p to 56p). Many items have increased dramatically including coffee (from \u00a31.63 to \u00a32.50), cinema tickets (from \u00a38.90 to \u00a39.62) and condoms (from \u00a36.63 to \u00a38.99). Marc Thomas, UK manager for PriceRunner, said: &quot;London is seen by many as an expensive holiday option, but if you&apos;re choosing to shop in Europe it is still relatively cheap. Many retailers are maintaining their low prices across tech and gadgets in a bid to kick-start the economy. &quot;Consumers should enjoy the lower prices now before the VAT increase kicks in at 20% in 2011.

He tripped over his tongue when trailing an interview with culture secretary Jeremy Hunt and uttered the c-word, after which he could only splutter as colleagues left him to read the headlines alone. He cited a &quot;coughing fit&quot; and disappeared from the airwaves to regain his composure. It was the emphatic nature of his delivery that caught the public imagination. He sounded like Ben Kingsley in Sexy Beast. Naughtie had no time to apply the brakes before crashing, at terminal velocity, into the word. And then, like a driver slowing down to observe the wreckage of another&apos;s prang, Andrew Marr made exactly the same gaffe when describing the incident on Start the Week only hours later. In line with BBC rules on impartiality, Naughtie will presumably have to invite the shadow culture secretary into the studio to abuse him as well. The hunt/cunt trap has claimed many broadcasters over the years. Nicky Campbell has suffered a similar linguistic nightmare twice. In a 2009 edition of consumer show Watchdog, his brain conflated the words &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;Duncan&quot; to achieve the aforementioned expletive. Then, on his Radio 5 Live show earlier this year, he had trouble with a phone-in discussion on the Kent hunt, pulling &quot;a Naughtie&quot; not once but twice in the same discussion. And rude words aren&apos;t the only black ice in a live broadcaster&apos;s path. Much like school children forced to attend a Christmas carol concert in church, they&apos;re often plagued with bouts of incurable corpsing. The Today staff are notorious for it. Charlotte Green famously lost all self-control when reading the news, prompting listeners to besiege BBC switchboards with requests for a replay.

These are the stark warnings made in a report on the current state of Pakistan&apos;s schools published last month by the British Council and debated by academics and policy makers in a series of public meetings across the country. The report, Teaching and learning in Pakistan: the role of language in education, sets out proposals that, if implemented, would seek to raise the status of the country&apos;s main regional languages, lower barriers to higher-paid government jobs and help to strengthen ties between language groups at a time when political instability is straining national unity. The report&apos;s author, British academic Hywel Coleman, who is an honorary research fellow at the University of Leeds, argues that action must be taken urgently. Pakistan is an economically divided society with 60% of its population living on less than $2 a day and more than a quarter of national income in the hands of the top 10%. Yet a language policy for schools, inherited from the British empire, is undermining the effectiveness of state education and excluding many of the poorest from skills and training that could help them break out of poverty. The report&apos;s key proposal is to provide teaching to students in the language they are most familiar with and, for the first time, reflect Pakistan&apos;s multilingual identity in classrooms. There are more than 70 languages spoken in Pakistan, yet Urdu, the national language and the medium of instruction in the majority of state schools, is spoken by just 7% of the population. Children learning in Urdu as a second language face major obstacles, particularly in their early years, Coleman says, which can range from slower progress in reading and writing to lack of support from parents who also struggle with Urdu. The report urges Pakistan&apos;s government to make schooling available in seven major regional languages, including Urdu, which would extend the delivery of first-language teaching to up to 85% of the population. Coleman draws on global research into the impact of home language education on children&apos;s attainment to argue that the policy could improve enrollments and help to boost attendance by girls. In Pakistan, just 60% of children compete primary school and only 10% finish secondary school, while 59% of girls attend primary school compared to 73% of boys. Coleman also proposes a realignment of English in the curriculum. English remains the preserve of the country&apos;s elite minority who are educated privately in English-medium schools and who can make an easy transition into English-medium higher education and higher-paid government jobs that require English-language qualifications. Current government strategy seeks to widen access to this English-only social strata by improving the quality of English teaching in state schools. Yet the provision of effective teaching and materials has been uneven, with the result that the majority of learners are failing to make even basic progress in English. Coleman&apos;s alternative model is to provide early-years education in students&apos; regional languages, with Urdu taught as a second language in primary school. English would be taught from the age of 10, with the option to introduce English-medium teaching later in secondary school. Coleman says his &quot;wish list&quot; for education reform has been positively received inside Pakistan. He is now in the process of analysing feedback before presenting his final proposals next April. Fakhruddin Akhunzada is assistant director of the Forum for Language Initiatives, a local NGO that works with minority language speakers in the north of Pakistan to develop first-language education. While FLI&apos;s initial projects are small, he says that results have been positive, and so far 70 students have received their education in their first language. But FLI&apos;s experience shows that it will be difficult to change entrenched attitudes about language status. &quot;People from most of these minor language communities are facing a kind of social stigma that their mother tongue is symbol of backwardness. They hesitate to use it and many believe that education in the mother tongue is inferior to education in Urdu or English. But our studies of pilot projects suggest that positive attitudes towards the mother tongue have been gaining ground over the past few years,&quot; Akhunzada said. Coleman believes that fundamental change will be necessary to raise the status of regional languages and give equality of access to opportunity. &quot;That will be the biggest hurdle because it will directly challenge the privilege that some sectors of Pakistan society have enjoyed,&quot; he said. &quot;At the moment, in order to gain access to the civil service and higher education you need to have a qualification in English. One of my suggestions is that people should have to demonstrate competence not only in English but also in Urdu and one of the other main regional languages. If that were to happen you would find that the elite private schools would start teaching other regional languages. Something like that would put the three languages on a more equal footing.&quot; Coleman hopes that pressure for change will come from international donors. Since 2002 the US has given $640m to improve education in Pakistan, with a further $7.5bn in civilian aid due over next five years. But at a recent conference, organised by Unesco in Bangkok, to assess progress towards the UN Millennium Development Goals for education, Coleman says there was little prospect of a shift in policy to support first language education. &quot;Pakistan is an urgent case. There was frustration at the conference that a lot of the international donors are not yet listening and are not aware of the relationship between languages in education and long-term implications for social cohesion,&quot; he said.", "publicationDate": "2010-12-07T14:01:05Z", "tags": ["Tefl", "Pakistan"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/dec/07/pakistan-schools-language-crisis-lotbiniere", "title": "Pakistan facing language 'crisis' in schools", "sentences": ["But at a recent conference, organised by Unesco in Bangkok, to assess progress towards the UN Millennium Development Goals for education, Coleman says there was little prospect of a shift in policy to support first language education."]}, {"article": "I took this shot in Tehran last year, after the presidential elections.\u00a0It was part of a story I did\u00a0about all the rooftop protests: every night at 10pm, people would go up to their roofs and shout slogans against the regime. Thirty years previously, just before\u00a0the revolution, people had gone up on to those same rooftops and done the same thing. Through a contact, I met a doctor who had returned to Iran after living in Italy. He invited me to dinner with his friends, and,\u00a0after the meal, we\u00a0all went together up\u00a0to the roof to join the protests. It was an amazing atmosphere.

The preliminary investigation, seen by Reuters, concluded that Thai special forces on an elevated railway track fired into the grounds of a temple where several thousand protesters had taken refuge on 19 May. A separate leaked report concluded that the bullet that killed a Reuters cameraman in protests the following month was also probably fired by a Thai soldier. The findings of the investigation flatly contradict statements by the Thai military, which has denied soldiers were responsible for the temple deaths. The report from Thailand&apos;s department of special investigation (DSI) said there was not enough evidence to determine who was responsible for three further deaths in the temple, but said all six victims were hit by high velocity bullets. &quot;There is a reasonable amount of facts, evidence and witness accounts to believe that [three] deaths resulted from security officials&apos; actions on duty,&quot; Reuters quoted investigators as saying. The report recommended that police investigate the deaths further. At the time of the protests, Amnesty International condemned the use of live ammunition against demonstrators. Benjamin Zawacki, Amnesty&apos;s Thailand researcher, spoke of eyewitness accounts and video recordings showing the military firing live rounds at unarmed people. Wat Pathum Wanaram, a Buddhist temple, had been designated a safe zone for women, children, the elderly and the infirm. Thousands fled there when the military used force  to disperse protesters occupying a nearby commercial district. According to the DSI&apos;s investigation, witnesses reported scenes of chaos outside the temple as gunshots rang out and civilians fled a shopping area. One witness said he saw soldiers firing from the raised train track into a medical tent inside the compound, where two nurses treating wounded civilians were killed. In total, 91 people were killed and at least 1,800 were wounded during the unrest in April and May. More than 30 buildings were set on fire in the worst political violence in modern Thai history. The Thai prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, blamed armed elements among the protesters for the temple deaths. Another DSI report, into the death of Reuters cameraman Hiro Muramoto, quoted a witness as saying that Muramoto collapsed as gunfire flashed from the direction of soldiers. Muramoto, a 43-year-old Japanese citizen based in Tokyo, was killed by a high velocity bullet wound to the chest while covering protests in Bangkok&apos;s old quarter. &quot;There is a reasonable amount of facts and evidence to believe that the death of Hiro was due to an act of the security forces who said they were acting according to official duty,&quot; the DSI report said, recommending police investigate the case further. Thailand&apos;s government has not yet publicly released the report into his death despite intense diplomatic pressure from Japan. The leaks came amid reports that the centre for the resolution of emergency situations (CRES), an ad hoc civilian-military body, will recommend a lifting of the state of emergency that came into force in April, as it believes that the political situation has returned to normal. The US group Human Rights Watch said last month that the Thai authorities were using emergency powers to violate fundamental rights and obstruct efforts to bring abusers to justice after the clashes. It said under the state of emergency, the authorities had detained suspects without charge for extended periods, using unofficial detention facilities with inadequate safeguards against possible abuse, and had imposed widespread censorship. In addition, officials in effect have immunity from prosecution for most acts committed under the decree. The protests began in March when the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship, known as the redshirts, took to the streets calling for the dissolution of parliament and new elections. Many of them back the former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was deposed in a 2006 coup and is currently in voluntary exile. Shinawatra has called for an international investigation into the violence, including the deaths at the temple.", "publicationDate": "2010-12-10T14:29:55Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Protest", "Reuters", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/10/thai-protest-deaths-military-may", "title": "Leaked report reveals Thai military responsible for protesters' deaths", "sentences": ["Thai soldiers were responsible for the deaths of three people at a Bangkok Buddhist temple during demonstrations in May, leaked government documents revealed today.", "Muramoto, a 43-year-old Japanese citizen based in Tokyo, was killed by a high velocity bullet wound to the chest while covering protests in Bangkok&apos;s old quarter."]}, {"article": "Thailand&apos;s department of special investigation (DSI) is refusing to release the full report on the death of Reuters cameraman Hiro Muramoto following a leak that he was killed by a Thai soldier.

So is it even worth waiting for Thor, or should you just dust off the old VHS of Masters of the Universe that you taped off the telly in 1993 and watch that instead? It&apos;s time for a side-by-side trailer comparison ...            Watch the trailer for Masters of the Universe            Watch the trailer for Thor 1: Best blond man walking around with his top off     Masters of the Universe 1    Masters of the Universe: Dolph Lundgren, a man with a punch hard enough to hospitalise Sylvester Stallone for four days.     Thor 1    Thor: Chris Hemsworth, a man who once played someone called Kim in Home &amp; Away. And this is just gratuitous. Why is his top off? At least Dolph Lundgren had just been enslaved by a malevolent super-skeleton. Hemsworth looks like he&apos;s about to apply some nice body lotion.

Here she&apos;s either been spooked by an apparition of her dead mother or she&apos;s just seen her haircut in a mirror. The trailer doesn&apos;t specify which.     Thor 2    Thor: It&apos;s Natalie Portman, fresh from her triumph in a Devendra Banhart video. Sadly, her performance has been hamstrung by a lack of terrible haircuts. Sad.  Winner: Masters of the Universe. 3: Best golden space palace     Masters of the Universe 3    Masters of the Universe: Every film about topless blond men who come to Earth and punch people and talk to pretty human women needs a golden space palace. And the Masters of the Universe palace is a classic of the genre. Flanked by footsoldiers. A throne on a raised platform. Plus the occupiers have smartly boosted the resale price by adding two giant symmetrical skull pits. Beautiful.     Thor 3    Thor: This might look another fine example of a golden space palace \u2013 it&apos;s certainly much more golden, and there are 24 footsoldiers compared to Masters of the Universe&apos;s 10 \u2013 but skull pits? No. What a letdown. Winner: Masters of the Universe. 4: Best hammy performance from an otherwise acclaimed actor     Masters of the Universe 4    Masters of the Universe: All golden space palaces in films about topless blond men who come to Earth and punch people and talk to pretty human women should be inhabited by a thespian who shouts everything and rolls his eyes a lot to compensate for his lack of preparation.

Thor 4    Thor: Meanwhile, Thor has Oscar-winning Bafta fellow Anthony Hopkins in a beard and what appears to be a metallic nipple pastie over one of his eyes.Winner: Thor.

Three senior members of Thailand&apos;s powerful privy council, a group of advisers appointed by the king, make clear their preference for an alternative to Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, who is considered a political liability because of his extramarital affairs in several European countries. The succession is of pressing concern as King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who turned 83 this month, is in poor health. Revered by most Thais, he is one of the few unifying figures in a country deeply divided between an urban elite and a rural poor. The great fear within the authorities is that with the divisive figure of the crown prince as king, any future political turbulence could split Thailand in two. The military and the police rely on loyalty to the crown to maintain control and without it their authority would be greatly weakened. This year Thailand experienced the worst political violence in its modern history. Ninety-one people died as protesters who support Thaksin Shinawatra, ousted as prime minister in a 2006 military\u00a0coup, called for the dissolution of parliament and new elections. A state of emergency imposed at the time still remains in force. The cable, written by the US ambassador, Eric John, in January, reports on his conversations with General Prem Tinsulanonda, the head of the privy council and a former prime minister, Anand Panyarachun, another former prime minister, and Air Chief Marshall Siddhi Savetsila. &quot;All three had quite negative comments about Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn,&quot; the cable reads. &quot;While asserting that the crown prince will become King, both Siddhi and Anand implied the country would be better off if other arrangements could be made. Siddhi expressed preference for Princess Sirindhorn; Anand suggested only the King would be in a position to change succession, and acknowledged a low likelihood of that happening.&quot; There are repeated references to the prince&apos;s affairs. When the US ambassador asked where the prince was, Prem is quoted as saying: &quot;You know his social life, how he is,&quot; which John says is a &quot;presumed reference to Vajiralongkorn&apos;s preference to spend time based out of Munich with his main mistress, rather than in Thailand with his wife and son&quot;. John also conveys Siddhi&apos;s observations about the prince&apos;s dalliances. The cable states: &quot;Siddhi, in a similar vein, noted that the Crown Prince frequently slipped away from Thailand, and that information about his air hostess mistresses was widely available on websites; he lamented how his former aide, now Thai ambassador to Germany, was forced to leave Berlin for Munich often to receive Vajiralongkorn.&quot; Apart from their concerns over the prince&apos;s behaviour, the privy council members also express unease over his ties with the fugitive ex-prime minister Thaksin, best known in the UK for owning Manchester City football club from 2007 to 2008. Thaksin spends most of his time in Dubai in self-imposed exile. &quot;Prem acknowledged Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn probably maintained some sort of relationship with fugitive former PM Thaksin, &apos;seeing him from time to time&apos;. Prem, clearly no fan of either man, cautioned that Thaksin ran the risk of self-delusion if he thought that the Crown Prince would act as his friend/supporter in the future merely because of Thaksin&apos;s monetary support; &apos;he does not enjoy that sort of relationship.&apos;&quot; In the cable, Anand blames the king&apos;s poor health partly on Thaksin, who at the time was acting as a political adviser to the Cambodian government. The king was in hospital in January, exercising 30 minutes a day on a stationary bicycle and passing a medicine ball with a physical therapist to build up strength and regain weight. Despite their reservations about the crown prince, John&apos;s interlocutors seemed resigned to his becoming king. &quot;Anand said that he had always believed that the Crown Prince would succeed his father, according to law. However, there could be complicating factors \u2013 if Vajiralongkorn proved unable to stay out of politics, or avoid embarrassing financial transactions \u2026 The consensus view among many Thai was that the Crown Prince could not stop either, nor would he be able, at age 57, to rectify his behaviour,&quot; the cable reads. &quot;After another pause, Anand added that someone really should raise the matter with the King, before adding with regret that there really was no one who could raise such a delicate topic (note: implied was the need for an alternative to Vajiralongkorn).&quot; Royal intrigue is also conveyed in another cable by John in October 2008. This confidential message reports on complaints by Samak Sundaravej, a former prime minister, that Queen Sirikit encouraged the coup that overthrew Thaksin. &quot;He showed disdain for Queen Sirikit,&quot; John writes, &quot;claiming that she had been responsible for the 2006 coup d&apos;etat as well as the ongoing turmoil generated by PAD [People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy] protests. He alleged the Queen operated through privy council president Prem Tinsulanonda who, along with others presenting themselves as royalists, worked with the PAD and other agitators. Citing his own regular meetings with King Bhumibol, Samak claimed he \u2013 rather than his opponents \u2013 was sincerely loyal to the king and enjoyed the king&apos;s support.&quot; What constitutes an insult?  The Thai royal family is protected by the country&apos;s lese majesty laws, making it an offence to insult the monarchy. Under article 112, anyone can file a complaint against someone they consider to have defamed the monarch. Missing from the code, however, is a definition of what actions constitute defamation or insult. Neither the king nor any member of the royal family has ever filed any charges under this law. In 2005, King Bhumibol encouraged criticism: &quot;I am not afraid if the criticism concerns what I do wrong, because then I know.&quot; He later added: &quot;But the king can do wrong.&quot; Since 2005, use of the law has been on the rise, for politicians, journalists and activists. In March 2007, a Swiss, Oliver Jufer, convicted of lese majesty, was sentenced to 10 years for spray-painting graffiti on portraits of the king while drunk. He was pardoned then deported. In 2008, Jonathan Head, the BBC&apos;s south-east Asia correspondent and vice-president of the Foreign Correspondents&apos; Club of Thailand, was accused of lese majesty by a police colonel, Watanasak Mungkijakarndee. Watanasak said Head&apos;s reporting between 2006 and 2008 had &quot;damaged and insulted the monarchy&quot;. The BBC rejected the charges as groundless. Also in 2008, Harry Nicolaides, an Australian, was arrested at Bangkok&apos;s international airport and charged with lese majesty, for an offending passage in his self-published book Verismilitude. After pleading guilty, he was jailed for three years. He was deported last year after being pardoned by the king. In June, the Thai government, which has removed tens of thousands of web pages in recent years for insulting the royal family, approved the creation of an online crime agency that will pursue alleged violators of the lese majesty laws. \u2022 The paragraph referring to Jonathan Head was amended on Thursday 16 December 2010 at 8.49am, removing a reference to him being expelled. The BBC says Head was not expelled but moved on as part of his rotation.", "publicationDate": "2010-12-15T21:30:03Z", "tags": ["The US embassy cables", "Thailand", "Thaksin Shinawatra", "WikiLeaks", "Media", "US news", "US foreign policy", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/15/wikileaks-thailand-royal-succession-prince", "title": "WikiLeaks cables: Thai leaders doubt suitability of prince to become king", "sentences": ["Also in 2008, Harry Nicolaides, an Australian, was arrested at Bangkok&apos;s international airport and charged with lese majesty, for an offending passage in his self-published book Verismilitude."]}, {"article": "Last year, two novels divided pretty much all the big SF literary prizes between them. China Mi\u00e9ville&apos;s fable of urban duplicity, The City &amp; the City, won the BSFA and Arthur C Clarke awards; and Paolo Bacigalupi&apos;s energetic future-thriller The Windup Girl won the John W Campbell and the Locus first novel. The duopoly of merit was reinforced when the genre&apos;s biggest prize, the Hugo, split its novel award between Mi\u00e9ville and Bacigalupi: a pretty much unprecedented event. Evidently, it&apos;s the wisdom of SF crowds that these two novels represent the best contemporary writing the genre has to offer. Accordingly, readers interested but not expert in contemporary SF and wondering where to start \u2013 the sci-fi-curious, we might say \u2013 could do a lot worse than these titles. Of the two, The City &amp; the City is probably the better novel, partly because it is more formally ambitious. But The Windup Girl is a very accomplished piece of writing, all the more impressive given that it&apos;s Bacigalupi&apos;s first novel. Its strongest feature is the worldbuilding \u2013 the intricately believable portrait of a future Thailand fighting back from environmental collapse. Crops are regularly devastated by genetically engineered blights, cities threatened by risen sea levels. Post-oil, society is powered by calories; spring-driven motors are wound up by bioengineered mammoths on treadmills. Merchants still trade, politicians still jockey for position, and fundamentalism still thrives. Bacigalupi&apos;s Bangkok is corrupt, riven, brawling and volatile, but also suffused with bustling, exhilarating energy. The protagonist is Anderson Lake, an American ostensibly in Bangkok to develop a new variety of motor-spring, in fact secretly scouting for blight-resistant foodstuffs. A hard-bitten company man, Anderson is as surprised as we are when he falls in love with the &quot;windup girl&quot; of the novel&apos;s title, a bioengineered artificial human called Emiko. Though created as a geisha for the executive Japanese market, Emiko has ended up in a ghastly Thai brothel. Her relationship with Anderson is often touching, and Bacigalupi generates real poignancy out of her degradation, though I&apos;m not sure he quite gets the balance right between critiquing Emiko&apos;s sexual objectification and simply reproducing it. The Windup Girl has been compared to William Gibson&apos;s seminal cyberpunk novel Neuromancer, and it&apos;s easy to see why. The plot-twists, the bursts of violence and a noir stylishness are all here. Perhaps the very qualities that make it a good entry-level text for SF newcomers may make it a little overfamiliar for more hardened fans. It&apos;s hardly the first novel to swap the &quot;cyber&quot; in cyberpunk for genetics (Paul McAuley&apos;s superb Fairyland did that in 1995); and Ian McDonald has already staked out the &quot;westerners writing developing world SF&quot; territory. But there&apos;s no doubting the intelligence of Bacigalupi&apos;s imagination, or his readability. The narrative alternates between passages of blasting action and lower-key character interaction: a convention of thriller plotting that, though a little cheesy, is certainly effective. At 544 pages, it&apos;s probably 100-or-so pages too long, and a much-anticipated encounter with a genetic wizard called Gibbons reads slightly anticlimactically at the end. But when it hits its sweet-spot, The Windup Girl embodies what SF does best of all: it remakes reality in compelling, absorbing and thought-provoking ways, and it lives on vividly in the mind.
