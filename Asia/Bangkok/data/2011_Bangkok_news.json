Airline staff queued up to go on strike, collapsed travel companies left clients stranded around the world, and holiday bookings wobbled as consumer confidence dipped. Mother Nature intervened in April as Iceland&apos;s Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano spewed its innards across a\u00a0considerable chunk of the northern hemisphere, costing the airline industry $1.7bn in lost revenue. Then, predictably, Britain&apos;s transport system froze to a standstill as the snow arrived in December. But there are reasons to be cheerful in 2011. TripAdvisor&apos;s annual Travel Trends survey \u2013 which sampled 6,000 users \u2013 has revealed that Brits are hesitantly positive about their travelling prospects, with one in 10 planning to holiday more often this year. The Great British &quot;staycation&quot; also looks to be on the wane, with just 38% of those surveyed planning to stay at home for their holiday compared with 45% last year. Voluntourism and adventure travel are set to rise in popularity, our appetite for the Middle East is expected to grow apace with new flights to the region, and long-haul travel is fighting its way back against the dominance of European city breaks and mid-haul sun-seeking. 1. EasyJet enters Jordan     Photograph: PA    Spearheaded by the emergence of Dubai as one of the world&apos;s busiest flight hubs (the airport&apos;s capacity surpassed JFK last September), and the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council&apos;s prediction that the region&apos;s tourist growth will outstrip any other in 2011, British holidaymakers are expected to pour into the Middle East. Having entered the region with its first flights to Tel Aviv in 2009, easyJet is adding Jordan to its portfolio, with flights into Amman scheduled to begin in March, from a lead-in price of \u00a3105.98 return.

Trailblazing in Nepal     Photograph: Rex Features    A recent TUI study reported British travellers are more likely to book an adventure travel trip over the next three years. For those looking to sate their inner explorer this year, a groundbreaking new trail in Nepal should do the job. Australian Robin Boustead has spent 152 days traversing a series of routes winding beneath the world&apos;s highest peaks over the past few years, meticulously mapping the Great Himalayan Trail (thegreathimalayatrail.org) \u2013 the first continuous trail across the Nepalese Himalayan arc from Kanchenjunga on the eastern border, through the foothills of Everest, concluding on the Tibetan border in the west. The inaugural public expedition, led by Boustead himself, begins in February and will cost an eye-watering \u00a320,500 for the entire trip.

Airbnb in Asia     Photograph: Alamy    Airbnb.com, the peer-to-peer B&amp;B network that invites tourists into locals&apos; spare bedrooms and apartments, grew phenomenally last year and has set its sights on Asia in 2011. While the network \u2013 and similar networks such as iStopOver and Crashpadder \u2013 has developed huge bases in Europe and North America (the site boasts more than 4,000 listings in New York), a promotional drive has seen the company&apos;s portfolio in Asia increase significantly. Beijing, Bangkok and Seoul have seen notable additions, but Shanghai (pictured)\u2013 helped by its large expat community \u2013 is leading the pack with a tenfold increase in the second half of last year, including sleek modern apartments in the French Concession, where the majority of the new additions are clustered.Details Shanghai rooms from \u00a36.40 per night (airbnb.com) 4.

The 19-day Andean and Caribbean Trails begins in the Ecuadorian capital of Quito before heading into the market town of Otavalo and then across the border into Colombia. The route takes in the old town of Popay\u00e1n and the Purac\u00e9 National Park in the south before rising up through Andean coffee plantations and the cloud forests of the Sierra Nevada foothills, then down on to the unspoilt beaches of the Tayrona National Park before finishing in the walled city of Cartagena (pictured).Details Eight departures in 2011 from 1 June, \u00a3650 plus a\u00a0kitty of \u00a3300 (dragoman.com) 6.

Libya is the last north African country to open up to European tourism and has seen steady rises in visitor numbers since the recent relaxation of visa requirements, making it possible for visitors to obtain visas at the point of entry.

Turin will be a\u00a0good bet, with the city acting as the focal point for a line-up of events celebrating the 150th anniversary of Italian unification (Turin was the newly united Italy&apos;s first capital from 1861-64). The recently derelict Officine Grandi Riparazioni \u2013 a vast 19th-century locomotive factory in the heart of the city \u2013 will house large temporary interactive &quot;laboratory exhibitions&quot;, and more than 300 Italian masterpieces (including works by Caravaggio, Giotto, Botticelli and Da Vinci) will be on show at the newly restored Venaria Reale, a 17th-century hunting palace on the fringes of the city.Details Ryanair (ryanair.com) flies to Turin from Stansted, Edinburgh and East Midlands from \u00a337.98 return.

Making an eco village in Sierra Leone     John Obey beach, Sierra Leone    Voluntourism is expected to continue to be one of the fastest-growing markets in global tourism, and a brand-new venture on a remote Sierra Leone beach is one of the most intriguing projects. As the country gears up for its 50th anniversary of political freedom in April, the John Obey beach community is the newest undertaking by Tribewanted \u2013 the social experiment that saw hundreds of volunteers build a sustainable eco resort from scratch in Fiji over the past three years.

The deal, which is still to get final approval from the Department of Health around the end of next month, will see Circle, Europe&apos;s largest healthcare partnership, take over the running of the hospital under an ethos of partnership. If the deal does get approval, which looks likely, it will be the first time that an operating franchise has been offered for an NHS acute hospital in England and will begin operating in June. However Circle, one of five organisations including one from the NHS to bid for the contract, which NHS East of England has recommended to run for a 10-year term, claims to do things differently to a conventional private sector organisation.  Made up of a partnership of clinicians but half-owned by investors, it says it can make a real difference to patient outcomes through a bottom-up style of management, giving a stake of the business to staff and putting patients at the heart of any decision making. And it believes it can turn around Hinchingbrooke, which caters for around 160,000 people and runs accident and emergency and maternity service, for no more cost. &quot;We&apos;re a social enterprise but partly owned because we believed it was better to have a smaller size of the pie but be well capitalised,&quot; says Ali Parsa, managing partner and founder of Circle. &quot;We work for our patients and have a set of priorities and our staff have a say in what we do, from consultants to cleaners.&quot; Circle was created five years ago on the back of complaints from consultants of poor management in healthcare institutions in both the private and public sectors, and he believed there was space for clinicians and staff to run their own hospitals.  It now has a number of NHS contracts and operates services for the NHS&apos;s Choose and Book initiative, which aims to give more choice to patients on where and when they use services. While Circle provides private services, Parsa says its aim was always to take on as many NHS patients as possible. &quot;There were people who thought it was giving over the asylum to the lunatics,&quot; says Parsa. &quot;But if we have a failing group of hospitals, let&apos;s demonstrate that we can do better. We have oncologists for example who meet on a regular basis and take on what our patients say, what we should fix, and we do this religiously. In healthcare institutions almost all decisions are made at the top and by the time it gets within the range of doctors and those lower down the scale they don&apos;t have a say.  &quot;Around 94% of our assets are owned by financial institutions or the stateand distanced from the interests of people. Everybody has the right interest but these interests are probably not identical. The same is true with state ministers who have to please a party or newspapers which may be at odds with the people who use a service. Those who work in hospitals, schools, should have a say in future of the enterprise. If you want to call that &quot;privatised&quot; so be it.&quot; Parsa says the proof of the pudding is in past projects. Circle took over the struggling Nations Healthcare and the running of Nottingham NHS treatment centre in 2008, running day services including skin surgery, endoscopy and radiology for NHS patients.  The company&apos;s Bath hospital, which opened in March 2010, boasts Norman Foster designed architecture and a five star experience and as Parsa puts it: &quot;A night in a hospital costs more than in a five-star hotel, so why shouldn&apos;t people get a similar experience?&quot; In Nottingham, Parsa says the company turned around the centre, raising productivity in a single year by 22% and lifting patient satisfaction to 99.6% \u2013 one of the highest in the country. Further he says it now has a lower return to theatre rate with 90% of staff rating themselves as happy in the job. &quot;The questions we ask are are we the best at patient outcomes and staff experience. Nottingham proved that patients could get better for the same price and clinical outcomes,&quot; says Parsa.  &quot;In Bath we said why can&apos;t it look like a private hopital and it has won an award alongside other contenders in Budapest and Bangkok. We got a Michelin starred chef to design the menus. We&apos;ve proved it can be done.&quot; In the Hinchingbrooke deal \u2013 with more details to be announced after the DoH&apos;s decision \u2013 staff would remain with the NHS but be given a share in Circle and the company would tackle the hospital&apos;s historic \u00a338.8m debt.  But Parsa, a former executive director at Goldman Sachs, defends that a five-star experience means five-star costs. &quot;It will cost significantly less,&quot; he says. &quot;Let&apos;s not forget that this is a hospital the NHS has tried to turn around for many years. It has a big debt burden on it&apos;s books that it hasn&apos;t always managed to balance. We believe we can do a better job. If not then it&apos;s our responsibility.  &quot;What we mean to do is sit with staff, unit by unit, and ask what should the hospital look like in two years&apos; time, what barriers are there and who should we deal with them?...We&apos;re eliminating the middle man and giving the same return as the NHS.&quot; The deal has been welcomed by NHS East of England and the hospital&apos;s management and was open to public consultation. &quot;Hinchingbrooke has major debts and might have had to close, or receive a large subsidy paid for by the taxpayer,&quot; says Dr Stephen Dunn, director of strategy at NHS East of England.  &quot;Thanks to this process this is not the case. We have selected a cutting edge partner with an innovative approach that will propel Hinchingbrooke into the premier league. This is not privatisation. Staff and assets will be protected, and the taxpayer will not be forced into bailing out Hinchingbrooke. This could be a model for hospitals that face similar challenges.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-01-10T14:50:10Z", "tags": ["Management", "HR", "Health and social care", "Public Leaders Network", "Healthcare Network", "Hospitals and acute care", "Policy"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com//Public/hinchingbrooke-hospital-franchise-deal", "title": "Closing in on the circle", "sentences": ["&quot;In Bath we said why can&apos;t it look like a private hopital and it has won an award alongside other contenders in Budapest and Bangkok."]}, {"article": "They have known each other since they were pre-teenage tennis brats. But, in an otherwise inconsequential match in Rome two years ago, Andy Murray and Juan Mart\u00edn Del Potro swapped invective that shocked the few spectators who had lingered in the cool night air at the Foro Italico to watch two young players reckoned to be leaders of the next generation. &quot;Always the same,&quot; Del Potro said, referring to Judy Murray, who was sitting behind the baseline in passionate support of her son. Murray later denied using the F-word in her defence at a changeover in the second set, but what he did not dispute was the flash of mutual anger that lit up a fractious encounter. After that first-round match, which Murray won when Del Potro retired with back spasms, their friendship has swayed between indifference and mild warmth. Del Potro went on to win his first grand slam, in New York. Murray did not. But he has twice come close to a slam breakthrough. If they meet in the fourth round of the Australian Open \u2013 not exactly a given, as Del Petro, out for a year, would have to get past Dudi Sela, 21st seed Marcos Baghdatis and 11th seed J\u00fcrgen Melzer \u2013 the Argentinian says there will be no childish animosity, no tantrums. &quot;We are\u00a0grown up now,&quot; says Del Potro. &quot;Is\u00a0fine.&quot; Of more consequence than a minor tennis feud is when Murray and Del Potro will make a move on the hegemony of Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. A year ago, Del Potro looked more likely to crack it. He had leapfrogged Murray in the rankings and was hitting his forehands with stinging intensity, rolling his muscled arm over the ball like Oscar Bonavena beating up on Muhammad\u00a0Ali. Then his wrist collapsed in a pre-Open tournament here at Kooyong and, after a couple of agonising rounds, he took a tumble of Agassian proportions, from fourth in the world at the age of 21, all the way to No 259. Some feared his career was over. Not everyone is convinced it still isn&apos;t. He said he would come back at the US Open, but he could not face it. Twice he tried. Twice he fell. He went out at the first time of asking, in straight sets to 78th-ranked Belgian Olivier Rochus in Bangkok in September; then the good Spaniard Feliciano L\u00f3pez put him away 6-3, 6-0 in Tokyo. He had never been lower in his life. Murray, meanwhile, spluttered and sparkled, grabbing back that fourth spot before slipping to fifth on the eve of this tournament. He has beaten Nadal and Federer in the Rogers Cup, not quite as good as Del Potro&apos;s double-hit of the legends in the US Open, but evidence he was making real progress. There is not much between them, except unfinished business, lingering jealousy \u2013 and Del Potro&apos;s wrist. &quot;My last year was terrible,&quot; Del Potro says, leaning forward and stroking his wrist as if it&apos;s a boxer&apos;s paw. He doesn&apos;t give many interviews outside Argentina. &quot;My English,&quot; he says, &quot;no good.&quot; It&apos;s no bad, either. &quot;All the year, very bad for me.&quot; He says he hit the depths of depression, worrying those close to him. &quot;My parents, my friends and my coaches, they follow me in my bad moments and in my best moments. They support me as I tried to fix my wrist and, of course, to be here. My friends, they talk to me a lot. They say &apos;You have to fight. You love tennis. It is your life. Try, try and try&apos;, they say to me \u2026 And that&apos;s what I&apos;m trying to do. Now I&apos;m here, I feel good about my body, about my wrist. I feel I am good person again.&quot; But how did he feel about losing ground to Murray, and the other young pretenders? &quot;Well, the world knows Andy is a great player. If I play against him here, maybe the match will be different from before [Murray leads 5-1], but I&apos;m not 100%. &quot;Andy is someone for the journalists to write about, [Novak] Djokovic too, because we are young. But I think now Andy and me we have a good relationship, after little bad moments. We were very young. I know Andy since 11 years old. We play same tournaments together in juniors. Now we are older.\u00a0Different.&quot; Del Potro and Murray share more than precocious tennis skills and sublimated animosity. The Scot too has suffered with a tender wrist. It forced him to sit out for several months and sent him into serious despond. Del Potro says such injuries are increasingly common because of the nature of modern tennis, with the emphasis on killer power and short rallies. &quot;I tore the tendons,&quot; he says. &quot;That takes me out between three and six months. I had more surgery in May. &quot;Of course I love the US Open and I wanted to play, but I couldn&apos;t. I was really sad, watching it on TV. I played in Bangkok and Tokyo but I didn&apos;t feel good, so I stopped for the season. I think it was a good decision. I just wanted to play for two hours in one go. The pain didn&apos;t stop completely until November.&quot; He played for more than three hours in Sydney last week and declared himself happy enough, before losing in straight sets in his next match to the German Florian Mayer. &quot;I felt good. No pain in my wrist. I don&apos;t know if I can play for an hour or for four hours, because I stopped for a year. But, if I play well, maybe I can surprise a few people. I feel good again. I can play without pain. I feel good about my hands. &quot;In tennis today, we play very hard with the wrist. It is dangerous, it is specific to our game. Some times now, I have to change my technique. I need time, maybe a month, to get my natural game back.&quot; At 22, he has time. After a year out, he has also shown he has patience. Murray is a year older, yet is perceived to have less time. Would this be his tournament, he was asked yet again? &quot;I have no idea,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t think any of the players do. I&apos;m focusing on my first match.&quot; Although Karol Beck is rated 104 in the world, the 28-year-old Slovak is the sort of first-round opponent good players dread because he has been largely anonymous since his return from a two-year ban imposed in 2006 for testing\u00a0positive for clenbuterol. Murray has seen him play a few times but never\u00a0from\u00a0the other side of the net; nor has he inquired\u00a0of\u00a0other\u00a0players about\u00a0him. &quot;I think he plays like a lot of Slovak and Czech players, a very flat hitter of the ball. I&apos;ll have to work a few things out when I get on court. You have to trust the training that you&apos;ve done and believe in it. That will get rid of some of the doubts.&quot; Murray has also put behind him the trauma of last year&apos;s final when defeat by Federer left him in tears. &quot;That was something I had to come back from,&quot; he admitted. &quot;Mentally, I&apos;m probably in a better place.&quot; Ripped tendons and shattered psyches: the modern game takes its toll.", "publicationDate": "2011-01-15T22:00:00Z", "tags": ["Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro", "Australian Open", "Tennis", "Sport", "Australian Open 2011", "Australia sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jan/15/australian-open-2011-juan-martin-del-potro", "title": "Australian Open 2011: Juan Mart\u00edn Del Potro targets greatest rally yet", "sentences": ["He went out at the first time of asking, in straight sets to 78th-ranked Belgian Olivier Rochus in Bangkok in September; then the good Spaniard Feliciano L\u00f3pez put him away 6-3, 6-0 in Tokyo.", "I played in Bangkok and Tokyo but I didn&apos;t feel good, so I stopped for the season."]}, {"article": "EUROPE Hotel One Hundred, Cardiff, Wales &quot;Small is beautiful&quot; is the philosophy of the family that runs this city-centre B&amp;B, and they&apos;re right.

Until now, it was thought that increased melting could lubricate the ice sheet, causing it to sink ever faster into the sea. The issue was a key unknown in the landmark 2007 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which pinned the blame for climate change firmly on greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. However, the impact of rising sea temperatures on melting ice sheets is still uncertain, meaning it remains difficult to put an upper limit on potential sea level rises. Understanding the risk is crucial because about 70% of the world&apos;s population live in coastal regions, which host many of the world&apos;s biggest cities, such as London, New York and Bangkok. &quot;The Greenland ice sheet is safer than we thought,&quot; said Professor Andrew Shepherd of the University of Leeds, who led the research published tomorrow in Nature. Shepherd&apos;s team used satellite imagery to track the progress of the west Greenland ice sheet as it slipped towards the sea each summer, over five years. Researchers had feared that more melting from the surface of the ice in hotter years would in turn provide more meltwater for a slippery film at the sheet&apos;s base. More melting would mean more slippage and a greater rise in the sea level. But they discovered that, above a certain threshold, the slipping began to slow. On-the-ground studies and work done on alpine glaciers suggest that higher volumes of meltwater form distinct channels under the ice, draining the water more efficiently and reducing the formation of a lubricating film. The Greenland ice sheet studied by Shepherd&apos;s team is up to 1,000m (3,280ft) thick. If the entire ice sheet melted, sea levels would rise by a catastrophic seven metres, but this is likely to take 3,000 years if warm air blowing over the ice is the only way in which the ice melts. Shepherd said most of the Greenland ice cap was on land and not in contact with the sea, unlike the west Antarctic ice sheet. That ice sheet contains enough water to push up sea level by six metres if it all melted. He said the next scientific question to answer was whether warmer oceans would erode the edges of ice caps, causing them to fall rapidly into the ocean. &quot;The real threat now is from the oceans melting the west Antarctic ice sheet, which is 3km-4km thick, of which 1km-2km is below sea level.&quot; Shepherd said his work was helping to reduce uncertainties about the consequences of climate change. Asked if he thought his work suggested the wider risks of global warming could be discounted, he said: &quot;Not at all.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-01-26T18:00:00Z", "tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "Climate change", "Science", "Polar regions", "Greenland", "World news", "Arctic", "Sea level", "Oceans"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/26/greenland-ice-sheet-climate-change", "title": "Greenland ice sheet is safer than scientists previously thought", "sentences": ["Understanding the risk is crucial because about 70% of the world&apos;s population live in coastal regions, which host many of the world&apos;s biggest cities, such as London, New York and Bangkok."]}, {"article": "An orchestra reveals much about itself from the way it tunes up: not the mere technicality of fixing the note but the onstage atmosphere in those moments before kick-off. The Los Angeles Philharmonic, fiddling and blowing full out as they warmed up for the first of two London concerts, part of a European tour, communicated exuberance, optimism and a discernible but unshowy Hollywood sheen. This is a big orchestra with, after some thin years in the 1990s, a freshly restored, sumptuous New World sound. Already the mood was high. &quot;Let&apos;s get the measure of this hall,&quot; they seemed to imply. &quot;You&apos;re going to see a lot of us.&quot; So we will: the Los Angeles Philharmonic and music director cum magician-maestro, Gustavo Dudamel, have just signed to become one of the Barbican&apos;s international associates, a partnership with five world-class orchestras including Amsterdam&apos;s Concertgebouw and Leipzig&apos;s Gewandhaus. On the scorching evidence of Thursday&apos;s concert of John Adams, Bernstein and Beethoven, this LA deal is an exciting prospect, with the bonus that Dudamel, whose work with El Sistema and the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Youth Orchestra is already the stuff of legend, will spend time coaching young players here too. The orchestra has performed this programme several times, in LA&apos;s Walt Disney concert hall, with live relays to 450 cinemas in the States and Canada, as well as in Lisbon. It&apos;s hardly surprising they delivered it with such aplomb and, in the best sense, swagger. Adams&apos;s high-energy, rhythmically intricate Slonimsky&apos;s Earbox (1995) owes much to Terry Riley&apos;s pivotal In C, as well as to Bernstein. The chance to hear his Symphony No 1 &quot;Jeremiah&quot; (1942) alongside Adams made for satisfying listening, with the mellow but occasionally frail-toned mezzo Kelley O&apos;Connor as soloist. In the work&apos;s compelling opening movement, &quot;Prophecy&quot;, the propulsive, lurching low brass and searing broad string theme pushed forward with the force of a digger churning up the world to expose its molten core. The second half contained Beethoven&apos;s seventh symphony, obligingly in the Oscars spotlight since the &quot;Allegretto&quot; features on the soundtrack to The King&apos;s Speech. Here Dudamel showed a new maturity \u2013 he did, after all, reach the grand age of 30 this week \u2013 and avoided any excessive conductorly intervention. Tempi were brisk, which proved a breathtaking challenge for the orchestra&apos;s large forces: they rose to it with unanimous adrenalin and finesse. Above all, musicians and Dudamel alike allowed Beethoven&apos;s genius to speak for itself, with ferocious vitality. It sounds easy, but that is the hardest task of all. This concert will be broadcast on Classic FM on 16 February. The Adams and Bernstein, recorded live in LA, are already available via iTunes. A small revolution shook the opera world this week, low-key and apparently local but likely to have a lasting impact. London&apos;s Little Opera House at the King&apos;s Head, Islington, north London, has announced the first ever fringe opera rep season, with performances by OperaUpClose of its celebrated La boh\u00e8me, together with Cinderella, Madam Butterfly, The Barber of Seville and a new staging of Leoncavallo&apos;s Pagliacci. Future plans include Monteverdi&apos;s Il ritorno d&apos;Ulisse, Mark Ravenhill&apos;s first foray into directing opera. Currently resident at the King&apos;s Head under the entrepreneurial artistic directorship of Adam Spreadbury-Maher, the company is a tiny nomadic outfit, camping between the Soho theatre, the Cock Tavern or wherever there&apos;s cheap, available space, with ambitions to venture south of the river, and even into the wilds beyond the M25. New programmes will be announced every two months. Performances are in English and treble-cast with professional singers. Madam Butterfly has been updated to Bangkok Butterfly to chilling effect. The rewritten libretto removes the story to a sleazy, high-rise penthouse where underage girls are on sale and the electrics are dodgy. Pinkerton (Randy Nichol) the yank pilot says &quot;awesome&quot; and Butterfly (Margaret Cooper) kills herself by putting a gun to her mouth. It fits the original without distortion. If not all the voices sound beautiful in such startlingly raw proximity \u2013 just a few metres away from anyone in the audience \u2013 they are none the less strong, full of promise and musically intelligent. Danyal Dhondy&apos;s chamber-scale rescoring, for clarinet, viola and piano, is inspired. OperaUpClose&apos;s mission is to appeal to novices or experts, and to &quot;bring opera to audiences who ordinarily might avoid it&quot;. Having read this week that the &quot;opera singer&quot; Gio Compario of the price-comparison website TV ads has signed a mega deal with Warner Music with his first CD out in March, all I can say is: Go Compare.

Mark Mobius, arguably the most renowned investor in politically risky emerging markets, told Citywire.co.uk that he was &quot;looking to buy&quot; in Egypt when the stock market reopens.

I&apos;d go one step further and say many theatres aren&apos;t even delivering that level of entertainment. When you see a major show in a West End venue with what looks like its touring set, or watch a third-choice &quot;name&quot; trying their best with a score that is clearly beyond them, you can&apos;t but feel for people who go heart in hand (and hand in wallet) to see such poor work. McDonald&apos;s at least maintains basic standards; some producers have no such worries. But musical theatre isn&apos;t quite bust. All over London, off-West End venues are showing that the musical can be a vibrant, alert, challenging and invigorating theatrical medium. One such is Rajni Shah&apos;s Glorious. This musical, commissioned by the Spill festival (18-24 April), will see Shah collaborate with a company drawn from local areas visited on tour, making each performance genuinely different. Written with Piaf composers (and two thirds of Superthriller) Ben and Max Ringham, Shah will be working as a performance artist within a traditional musical structure \u2013 an experiment that should widen her audience base beyond obvious musical fans. I&apos;m going on word of mouth here, but it sounds like a welcome development in an art form whose most recent innovator is Andrew Lloyd Webber. And there&apos;s plenty in a more traditional vein if that&apos;s what floats your boat. Islington&apos;s King&apos;s Head recently rebranded itself as London&apos;s Little Opera House following the Cock Tavern and Opera Up Close&apos;s runaway hit La Boh\u00e8me, and recently showed a version of Madame Butterfly, wittily updated to present-day Bangkok. In July, Regent&apos;s Park Open Air theatre is bringing us Gershwin&apos;s sumptuous Crazy for You from the team behind its 2010 hits Into the Woods and the multi-award winning Hello, Dolly!. Here, you can get full-blown razzle dazzle for as little as \u00a315 (with even Open Air theatre&apos;s top tickets nearly a third cheaper than the equivalent for a piece of McTheatre). And of course there&apos;s the Union theatre in Southwark. Sasha Regan&apos;s space gives the Menier Chocolate Factory some stiff competition. Specialising in witty, fresh takes on musical classics, it punches above its weight. Regan&apos;s own company does a mean line in an all-male Gilbert and Sullivan; particular jewels have been their sell-out 2009 Pirates of Penzance and last year&apos;s critically acclaimed Iolanthe. In such a small space there&apos;s no need for mics (you can almost see the performers&apos; tonsils), while the intimacy demands quality turns from performers who have nowhere to hide. Meanwhile Woody Sez, the new bluegrass musical about the life of Woody Guthrie, is churning &quot;big West End biopics such as Jersey Boys into a heap of dust&quot;. Guthrie&apos;s ability to speak for the disposed, poor and downtrodden has never felt more vital; he may have been singing about the Depression, but if the shoe fits ... In any case, it&apos;s a deft and inspirational piece of social commentary. There must be hundreds more examples like this \u2013 I&apos;d love to hear some more \u2013 so let&apos;s not throw the baby out with the bathwater.

I&apos;m not flying with Jet2, but am booked to travel over the Easter weekend. Is this a sign of a lack of confidence in the area? If so should I be worried \u2013 and are others likely to follow suit?Chris Adkinson Jet2 is stopping flights to Sharm el Sheikh and Hurghada from several UK airports from 1 March, but for the rest of February you can book to fly there. The airline says: &quot;While the Red Sea resorts are not currently affected, the safety and comfort of our customers is our number one priority, and as such we do not want them to face the stressful uncertainty of whether their holiday will go ahead as planned.&quot; This is consistent with Jet2&apos;s decision to cancel departures to Tunisia, another currently unpredictable destination, through this summer. Neither decision is expected to cause other carriers to follow suit. The obvious missing piece in the jigsaw is how fast-moving and unpredictable political events play out in both countries and the effect this has on safety for tourists. What Jet2&apos;s move does do is remove any element of uncertainty from its \u2013 and its customers&apos; plans. It says feedback from customers suggest they are &quot;relieved&quot; by their decision. As the statement from Jet2 notes, Red Sea resorts continue to be unaffected by events in Cairo and other major cities. Responding to the Jet2 story in trade mag Travel Weekly, some agents suggested that this decision could be motivated as much by Jet2&apos;s belief that demand for flights to the Red Sea is likely to drop off over the next few months as by safety concerns. My mum turns 60 in April and has always dreamed of going to Venice. So, for her birthday, my dad has arranged for both of them, plus my brother and me to go to Venice for four days. We fly on Monday 4 April and return on Thursday 7 April. We&apos;ll definitely do the big sites like St Mark&apos;s, but can you suggest less well-known sights? My mum is into art, music and literature but I&apos;m sure she would love to see anything that is interesting or reflects Italian culture. Also, I know it can be hard to find a good but reasonably priced restaurant. Ideally we would like to go for a special celebratory meal on one night and eat at more everyday trattorias for the rest of the trip.Eliza Lebowski With four days you can cover the principle historic and artistic sights, but I would suggest taking it slowly. Intersperse diving into St Mark&apos;s Square and Basilica, the Accademia and the Peggy Guggenheim Collection with simply strolling around, especially in the Dorsoduoro and Cannaregio districts. In the latter the Ca&apos; d&apos;Oro, a 15th-century house full of great art, and the strikingly different Jewish ghetto are wonderful, must-see sights. After two days you may be flagging. If so, hop on a local vaporetto (ferry) out to the islands of Murano and Buranofor another perspective on Venice. On another day you might consider investing in the Chorus Pass, which allows entry to 16 churches around Venice, many packed with great and little-seen art treasures. To avoid disappointment when eating in Venice, venture far and wide. Anywhere with a multi-language menu or on the more obvious routes through the city is likely to be underwhelming. Some of the city&apos;s best food is served in the form of cicheti (small, tapas-like plates) in traditional osterie (pub-restaurants) and bacari (bars) down alleys and on obscure squares. There are some of these around the San Marco, San Polo and Cannaregio sestieri (districts) \u2013 finding them can be half the fun. Guardian journalist Gavin McOwan explored some of these last year. While seeking out these spots will take you off the tourist trail like almost nothing else in Venice, the special meal you&apos;re after can be found too. There&apos;s a lot of choice in the top-end category. The Corte Sconta, in the Castello district, is one of the best-regarded high-concept places. Or try the classic Fiaschetteria Toscana in Cannaregio. Book for around 8.30pm to give you time for a glass of prosecco beforehand. We are looking at a holiday for around about 20 June 2011 that incorporates a one-week cruise from Orlando round the eastern Caribbean. Some websites refer to this as the rainy season for the Caribbean \u2013 likely to be quite cloudy but warm. Can you offer any further information. I love the warmth, could persevere with cloud, but would hate constant rain. Ann I was a little thrown by this question originally, as when I last went to Orlando it was pretty much slap bang in the middle of Florida. Cruises stated as departing from Orlando in fact leave from Port Canaveral \u2013 on Florida&apos;s east coast, close to the famous Cape and 52 miles from the City Beautiful. Most cruise lines put Port Canaveral in brackets, like an airport claiming proximity to a big city putting its true location in as an afterthought like Frankfurt-Hahn and Venice Treviso. As well as &quot;Orlando&quot;, these cruises usually call at Nassau (Bahamas), St Thomas and St Maarten in the eastern Caribbean and as San Juan (Puerto Rico). According to the always useful Weather to Travel (Tomorrow&apos;s Guides, \u00a38.99), June is the wettest month of the year in Nassau. There is on average twice as much rain as in May and around 50% more than July. The weather tends to be hot and humid, and though you can expect it to rain most days, this should be concentrated into afternoon downpours, which tend to be brief and heavy. If you&apos;re on a cruise you may find that rain isn&apos;t too much of a problem as there&apos;ll be plenty to do below decks, but showers could have an impact on how much you enjoy your time ashore. I&apos;m planning a three-week trip around south-east Asia in August. We are visiting Singapore, Bali, Thailand and Kuala Lumpur so far. Do you have any tips for low-cost travel between these locations? Also, can you recommend a place in Thailand with a bit of nightlife and a beach but not the raucous shores of Koh Samui or Ko Phangan?Barrioprincess As I noted in the live blog last week, there&apos;s a mind-boggling array of low-cost carriers operating in south-east Asia. Big players include Air Asia (whose hubs are Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru, near Singapore, Kota Kinabalu, Kuching, Bangkok and Jakarta), Jetstar Asia and Tiger Airways (both with hubs in Singapore). In Thailand try Thai Airlines&apos; low-cost subsidiary, Nok Air, and Bangkok Airways. Any experiences readers have of flying with these airlines are welcome in the comments section. Of course, there are also inexpensive bus and train links between many destinations. Requests for alternative Thailand come up a lot; I&apos;ve recently recommended Ko Lanta, Ko Tao and Ko Chang. Any other suggestions?", "publicationDate": "2011-02-09T05:27:00Z", "tags": ["Egypt holidays", "Venice holidays", "Cruises", "Florida holidays", "Caribbean holidays", "Budget travel", "Thailand holidays", "Travel"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2011/feb/09/ask-tom-travel-advice-egypt", "title": "Ask Tom - your travel dilemmas answered", "sentences": ["Big players include Air Asia (whose hubs are Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru, near Singapore, Kota Kinabalu, Kuching, Bangkok and Jakarta), Jetstar Asia and Tiger Airways (both with hubs in Singapore).", "In Thailand try Thai Airlines&apos; low-cost subsidiary, Nok Air, and Bangkok Airways."]}, {"article": "It&apos;s pitch black as I set off tentatively in my kayak, the starless sky merging seamlessly into the inky river. The only sound is of my paddle in the water and a faint chirping of cicadas.\u00a0Suddenly the darkness is broken \u2013 a tree decorated in a thousand fairy lights is frantically flickering on the riverbank. &quot;It&apos;s the firefly disco,&quot; says Chilly, my guide, pointing at the twinkling display. I am, it&apos;s fair to say, in the middle of nowhere. This is the Tatai river, east of Koh Kong, in the southern reaches of Cambodia&apos;s Cardamom mountains. Half-way between Bangkok and Phnom Penh, this is a pristine area of rainforest and coastal mangroves that barely features on the tourist trail. What&apos;s more I&apos;m camping \u2013 though it&apos;s not exactly pop-up tent and baked beans. I&apos;m staying at the Four Rivers Floating Lodge, which takes glamping to a whole new extreme.     The spacious tents at Four Rivers.    The brilliant idea of Romanian owner Valentin Pawlik, the entire resort is waterborne. You get here by boat, arriving at one of a series of floating wooden platforms. A central pontoon houses bar, restaurant and library. There are 12 huge and super-luxurious South African safari tents (six more are planned), with private decks and sunloungers, double-sinked en suite bathrooms, and flatscreen TVs and DVD players that seem a tad incongruous in the heart of the jungle. But, hey, this is wilderness in style.\u00a0 It&apos;s all very eco-friendly too \u2013 largely solar-powered, and staffed mostly by locals \u2013 so you needn&apos;t have a guilty conscience. Move it away and there&apos;d be little sign that it had ever existed.\u00a0 Leaving the fireflies to party I paddle slowly back home and feast on spicy shrimp and freshwater fish with coconut, cooked in banana leaves, before heading for a blissful night&apos;s rest, lulled to sleep by the gentle bobbing of the water. Most visitors to Cambodia flock to the revitalised capital of Phnom Penh further east, and the temples around Siem Reap in the north. This coastal region, part of the Koh Kong Conservation Corridor, is home to some of the country&apos;s most impressive natural sights. The long civil war kept developers and loggers at bay, and the potential for ecotourism is huge (although the threat of hydroelectric power plants looms).\u00a0 Four Rivers, with its gorgeous setting on a bend in the river, is magical at all times of day \u2013 misty in the morning, glowing at sunset and prettily lit up after dark \u2013 and as tranquil a place as you could wish for. I spend much of my time here kayaking through the mangrove maze (spotting those fireflies, and watching monkeys gather at the water&apos;s edge at dusk), swimming in the river from steps outside my tent (a pool is planned) and visiting waterfalls, where the pounding torrent gives a great back massage. There are excursions into the jungle, led by a former poacher, to spot wildlife and to visit villages and fruit plantations (overnight camping is a new option too). As I&apos;m here at the end of the rainy season, when leeches and mud make trekking treacherous, we take a boat downstream instead. Thick mangrove forests line the banks, and dolphins can sometimes be spied in the estuary opening on to the Gulf of Thailand. Koh Kong island appears on the horizon, an as yet undeveloped paradise with pristine beaches and untouched rainforest.     Village life on Koh Sra Lau.    We stop at Koh Sra Lau, an island with one tiny fishing village, and wander around while women sit mending nets and offer us fried fish with tamarind sauce and papaya. There&apos;s no tourist fatigue here, just friendly welcomes. A little boy grabs my hand and leads me to the village school, where children proudly sweep the classroom before the teachers appear. I&apos;m keen to explore more, so the next day head to Chi Phat village, and a community-based project started by conservation charity Wildlife Alliance in the Southern Cardamoms Protected Forest. It aims to preserve the rainforest by helping villagers earn a living from ecotourism, instead of illegal logging or hunting endangered animals, and giving tourists a unique green adventure. It&apos;s a winding bus journey down to the port town of Andoung Tuek and a two-hour boat ride along Phipot river to the village. There are several guesthouses, but I choose a homestay on the outskirts of town with Chou and her young family, who sit underneath the stilted wooden house, a cow curled at their feet like a pet dog. A far cry from the luxuries of Four Rivers it may be, but it&apos;s clean, comfortable and a great way to see everyday village life. Chi Phat is all about outdoor adventure: you can trek or cycle into jungle and mountains for days at a time, sleeping in hammocks or rustic campsites, go birdwatching, take boat trips or check out the nearby bat caves and an area dotted with mysterious ancient burial jars. I sign up for a 28km mountain bike tour to O&apos;Malu waterfall. Crossing grassy plains and traditional farmland, we follow Lucky \u2013 a 23-year-old from the village who&apos;s been trained in everything from bike maintenance to wildlife spotting \u2013 up steep paths through the tangled jungle, with gibbons calling high overhead. It&apos;s a challenging ride in parts (yep, I end up on my bum in a puddle at one point) but jumping into the cool pool at the base of the waterfall is a great reward. There&apos;s no one else around as we tuck into lunch, sitting on rocks in the sunshine, surrounded by rainforest, the waterfall roaring. Marvellous though the sights of Angkor Wat and the buzz of Phnom Penh are, I can&apos;t help thinking that it&apos;s Cambodia&apos;s more remote natural attractions that offer the best adventure \u2013 and one it would be a shame to miss.\u00a0 \u2022 Tents for two at Four Rivers Eco Lodge (ecolodges.asia) cost from $118 a night including breakfast and boat transfers.

Of course, you&apos;d be forgiven for not getting your hopes up. After all, roughly 38% of Hollywood&apos;s second-rate output seems to star the indefatigable Cage, as the one-time Oscar winner continues to peddle a seemingly endless procession of frankly terrible flicks in an effort to keep the taxman off his back. Few stars can boast such a rollercoaster career as Cage. He&apos;s an actor who seems to lurch from role to role, punctuating the dark depths of an eclectic straight-to-video CV with some occasional award-winning highs. But faced with an avalanche of Nicolas Cage movies to choose from, how can the discerning movie-goer distinguish the Raising Arizonas from the Ghost Riders? Here&apos;s a handy checklist to help you determine what kind of Nicolas Cage movie you&apos;re watching. Check the hair   There&apos;s a direct correlation between the length of Cage&apos;s locks and the awfulness of his movies. As a rule of thumb, if the hair&apos;s short (Raising Arizona, Leaving Las Vegas, Bad Lieutenant) then you&apos;re on to a winner. But if it&apos;s long, greasy and swept back behind his ears (Con Air, The Sorcerer&apos;s Apprentice, Next) then \u2013 yes \u2013 you&apos;re watching a bad Nic Cage movie. Is he wearing a vest?  Here&apos;s a handy hint for you. If the role requires Cage to bare his well-chiselled midriff, and it doesn&apos;t star Sean Connery (The Rock), then stand up and make a dash for the nearest available exit. Likewise, if Cage is in any way called upon to take on the action-hero mantle, dispatching faceless goons with an arsenal of firearms (National Treasure), martial arts (Bangkok Dangerous) or a magic sword (Season Of The Witch) \u2013 run for the hills. In short, if his physique resembles anything other than a Home Alone-era Macaulay Culkin then you&apos;re probably watching a bad Nic Cage movie. Can he see into the future?  If Nicolas Cage has dug up a time capsule that predicts global catastrophes (Knowing), or he&apos;s playing a cheap Vegas showman who can see into the future (Next), then you too can come over all clairvoyant and predict that you&apos;re about to waste the next 90 minutes of your life watching a bad Nic Cage movie. Don&apos;t be fooled by the quality of his co-conspirators  If the film is directed by Martin Scorsese (Bringing Out The Dead), co-stars Michael Caine (The Weather Man), or his love interest is played by either Helen Hunt (Kiss Of Death), Gina Gershon (Face/Off), or even Angelina Jolie (Gone In 60 Seconds), don&apos;t be fooled into thinking you&apos;re watching a good Nic Cage movie \u2013 you&apos;re not; put the DVD down and step away from the bargain bin. Is he in the army?   Yes? Don&apos;t even bother. Whether he&apos;s protecting Navajo codetalkers (John Woo&apos;s Windtalkers) or attempting an altogether different type of Woo-ing involving a Greek island, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and a musical instrument from the lute family (Captain Corelli&apos;s Mandolin), then you&apos;re not just watching a bad Nic Cage movie, you&apos;re watching a bad Nic Cage movie that&apos;s likely to be about as entertaining as a Justin Bieber fanclub picnic.", "publicationDate": "2011-02-19T00:05:00Z", "tags": ["Culture", "Film"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/feb/19/nicholas-cage-bad-film-guide", "title": "Nicolas Cage's new film Drive Angry 3D, the next Raising Arizona or Gone In 60 Seconds?", "sentences": ["Likewise, if Cage is in any way called upon to take on the action-hero mantle, dispatching faceless goons with an arsenal of firearms (National Treasure), martial arts (Bangkok Dangerous) or a magic sword (Season Of The Witch) \u2013 run for the hills."]}, {"article": "Criselda Gallo sits in a white coat behind the desk of a small one-room building that serves as a health centre to the South Field resettlement area in Laguna province. There are more than 12,800 people living in the long streets of single-room houses, virtually all of whom were made homeless by the catastrophic flooding to which the Philippines is prone. Including the 2,400 very poor residents living beyond the resettlement area, Gallo is the sole provider of state-funded healthcare for more than 15,000 people. She is not a doctor, or even a nurse. She is trained as a midwife. But Gallo is all the district of Bi\u00f1an can afford. She does everything. She starts work at 7am and finishes at 5pm, but patients can call or text her at any time if a woman goes into labour. On Mondays, she offers general out-patient treatment, on Tuesdays she has an antenatal clinic, on Wednesdays she does immunisation, on Thursdays she offers more treatment and on Fridays she runs a family planning clinic. She sees 30 to 50 patients a day. Most of their complaints sound minor, but under-nutrition, poor living conditions and pollution can make them serious. Children come with coughs and colds and diarrhoea, adults with hypertension and dizziness, she says. But she has leaflets on dengue fever \u2013 an often lethal mosquito-borne disease for which there is no treatment. She has seen two suspect cases recently. The workload and her relative lack of training do not seem to worry her. &quot;It&apos;s OK for me,&quot; she says. &quot;This is my duty and I love it very much, especially delivering the babies.&quot; Vast numbers of Filipino families take out loans to pay for their daughters to train as nurses \u2013 but the objective is to get them a job abroad, where they can send home part of their salary. Sadly, out of 100,000 a year who train, only half qualify and only 13,000 succeed in obtaining overseas employment \u2013 the US and the UK are favourite destinations, but both have reduced the numbers they will take. But the 37,000 qualified nurses left in the Philippines every year cannot get jobs at home either. The health system cannot afford to employ them. Many end up answering the phones in call centres. Lower skilled, lower paid midwives provide local primary care instead. In Bi\u00f1an, with a population of 272,000 people, there are 17 midwives, one doctor (whose role is partly administrative) and three paramedics. Health worker shortage This mismatch between the numbers of nurses trained and the numbers employed is extreme in the Philippines, but not unusual around the world. The UK in the past decade has lurched from training too few for the NHS&apos;s needs \u2013 which led to large-scale recruitment from the Philippines \u2013 to training sufficient numbers, and now looks likely to produce too few again as training places are cut as a result of the recession. Poor countries in Africa train doctors and nurses only to lose them to wealthier countries on the continent \u2013 particularly South Africa \u2013 or to NGOs, which pay better than the state. Overall, the world is short of health workers. A conference last month in Bangkok of the Global Health Workforce Alliance \u2013 an umbrella group bringing together governments, NGOs, professional organisations and others \u2013 pledged to work towards swelling the numbers globally by 3.5 million, which it said is necessary if the poorest countries are to achieve the millennium development goals by 2015. Henk Bekedam, the WHO&apos;s Manila-based director of health sector development for the western Pacific region, says a free market in healthcare does not work. Governments should plan ahead and control the training of health workers so that they can better fulfil their own needs (which will require donor help for the poorest). But the free market will not deliver good care either. Doctors who charge patient consultation and prescription fees have an incentive to give them unnecessary treatment. &quot;The market is not interested in safety, not interested in quality and monitoring,&quot; he says. After Sars, it has become possible to discuss this in Asia, he says, and China, in particular, has begun to change. The inter-dependence of states in the face of a spreading and dangerous disease was clear. The same issues arise with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, which is spreading \u2013 albeit slowly \u2013 around the world. To contain diseases, patients have to be diagnosed and treated. That requires sufficient health workers as well as the right drugs.

A bloke peers up Marilyn&apos;s billowing skirt. Teenagers jostle a wobbly Russell Brand. A Kuwait scarf is draped around Bollywood star Aishwarya Rai. &quot;Where is Tony Blair?&quot; asks a tourist from Afghanistan. Who does he want a photograph with? &quot;All of these bastards,&quot; he says, making a beeline for George W Bush. There&apos;s a commotion outside No 10 Downing Street: the top of Nicolas Sarkozy&apos;s right ear has been chewed off. Is Mike Tyson marauding through the building? The diminutive French president is unceremoniously wheeled away for some TLC with molten wax. In an era of virtual reality, interactive Wiis and 3D TVs, it is difficult to imagine a more anachronistic attraction than a crowded dark room peopled with static wax models. But Madame Tussauds is more popular than ever. After the venerable London attraction&apos;s busiest ever year, next month sees the opening of a new Madame Tussauds in Blackpool. Another, the 12th Madame Tussauds in the world, will be added in Vienna. Almost every month, a new celebrity is added to the waxen lineup. Gok Wan is set for Blackpool, while the much-requested Justin Bieber will arrive in London, New York and Amsterdam next month. Tussauds&apos; owners, Merlin Entertainments, is the world&apos;s second largest leisure group after Disney, with a portfolio of fun that includes Alton Towers, the London Eye and Legoland. Last year it reported visitor numbers up by 10% across its attractions with a 16% jump in profits to \u00a3239m. Madame Tussauds may be its most unlikely success story. Born in Strasbourg in 1761, Marie Tussaud studied model-making under Dr Philippe Curtius, a doctor who became highly skilled at making anatomical models from wax. They moved to Paris and she created figures for a waxwork exhibition, narrowly escaped the guillotine in the French Revolution, and ended up making death masks of guillotine victims. Tussaud inherited Curtius&apos;s models and her travelling exhibition of waxworks became the touring newspaper of the day, providing vivid impressions of contemporary events, particularly the revolution, in a time before photographs. When she settled in Britain and opened a museum in Baker Street in 1835, her most popular exhibit was the &quot;chamber of horrors&quot; featuring murderers and criminals. This tradition of what academics call &quot;dark tourism&quot; endures today: there is something morbid about peering at Amy Winehouse&apos;s skinny but healthily waxy arms. In Tussauds&apos; alternative reality, there are two Winehouses so one body can be regularly removed to repaint her tattoos, which get worn away by all the fluttering fingers of fans, touching her with a delicate concern. &quot;Madame Tussaud believed she provided entertainment, artistic enlightenment, historical education and a place of pilgrimage,&quot; writes Pamela Pilbeam, author of Madame Tussaud and the History of Waxworks. This presentation of news as entertainment continued under Tussaud&apos;s sons and grandsons, who placed famous figures in dramatic historical dioramas. But Tussauds (which has now dropped the apostrophe) never quite enjoyed the credibility of a museum and tended to be sneered at by historians. Since the 1960s, theorists of high culture have been more forgiving. &quot;There is something irresistibly timeless about Tussaud&apos;s, as though the clock had obstinately stopped at the high noon of Victorian history painting,&quot; wrote Roy Strong, former director of the Victoria and Albert Museum. More recently, Pilbeam has argued that Tussauds presents an &quot;intimately corporeal biographical history&quot;. Academics may mock, but &quot;for most people history is biography and the story of famous people, and Tussaud&apos;s always excelled in portraying them&quot;. Tussauds, in short, has always enabled us to touch the hem \u2013 or bum \u2013 of royals, celebrities and criminals. Half-term in its rabbit warren of rooms on London&apos;s Marylebone Road is noisy, hot and busy. This carnival of camera phones, caressing and even groping (the waxen men do have &quot;moulds&quot; where their private parts would be so that their trousers hang properly, but no, nothing too realistic down there) is the celebrity world were we in control. In this fantasy land, there are no ropes, red tape, spin doctors or security minders to come between us and our idols. &quot;I squeezed somebody&apos;s bum. Who&apos;s bum did I squeeze? Was it Robbie Williams?&quot; Vicki Kennett asks her daughters, Miranda, 12, and Emma, 10. &quot;And you kissed Lewis Hamilton,&quot; says Miranda severely. &quot;Here you have an illusion of rubbing shoulders with the stars,&quot; continues Vicki, insisting she didn&apos;t really kiss Hamilton. &quot;Some of them are really charismatic. It&apos;s the way they&apos;ve done their eyes. It looks like they are staring at you.&quot; But she is a little wistful about when Tussauds seemed less in thrall to celebrity culture. &quot;I remember coming down here when I was little and there was a massive reconstruction of the Battle of Trafalgar,&quot; she says. &quot;It was more about storytelling than celebrity.&quot; Perhaps there is only so much CGI and 3D TV you can take, because the youth of today seem weirdly bewitched by these figures, which still really are fashioned from wax. Each model is painstakingly crafted using modelling techniques pioneered by Marie Tussaud and featuring chicken wire, newspapers and clay. The figures take four months to make and typically cost \u00a3150,000. The hair, for instance, is not a wig: each strand of real hair is individually inserted into the artificial scalp. Unusually, in these days of tightly controlled image rights, Madame Tussauds claims there are no contracts and no celebrity is paid to be reproduced in wax. Most stars seem to enjoy the indulgence of being measured and photographed in a two-hour sitting. Even David Cameron found time to pose for the waxworkers at No 10. &quot;They give up their time for nothing but the privilege and honour of having their figure done,&quot; says Liz Edwards, spokeswoman for Madame Tussauds. A few stars succeed in controlling their doppelgangers with a rule or two: Tom Cruise and Mel Gibson, for instance, do not allow their wax selves to be photographed by the press or used in promotional photography. But most even donate their own clothes. Boris Johnson took off his suit and handed it over immediately after his sitting; his trouser legs still sport a small tear where he caught the hem in his bicycle chain. Teen heartthrobs are the most pawed over. Twilight star Robert Pattinson is currently the most touched model. His face is wiped clean of lipstick marks several times a day. Cheryl Cole, Miley Cyrus and Zac Efron are mobbed by pre-teens. But some favourites are not the obvious ones. Jo O&apos;Hare, 23, thinks that her boyfriend, Matt Holland, 24, was most taken with Cheryl Cole. Oh no. &quot;It&apos;s all about Stephen Hawking,&quot; he says. &quot;He was brilliant; I had a photo taken with him.&quot; &quot;Audrey Hepburn was so beautiful in real life that her waxwork didn&apos;t do her justice, whereas Charles and Camilla were very good,&quot; reckons Moira Carrasco from Surrey, who is visiting with her daughter and granddaughter. The theory that ugly folk make better waxworks may be disproved by the unconvincing Wayne Rooney. Older folk, however, and lived-in faces, work better: Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman are certainly more convincing than Daniel Radcliffe. Modern trends may be working in Madame Tussauds&apos; favour: as celebrities turn ever more plasticky with their botox and botched surgery, so the waxworks look ever more real. The ubiquity of Madame Tussauds, found everywhere from Bangkok to Berlin, may reflect the globalisation of Hollywood but each city gets the waxworks it deserves. Washington DC is the only Tussauds to feature a gallery of all 44 US presidents, which opened last week, while Tussauds in Las Vegas features the only topless figure (former porn star Jenna Jameson) and the unforgettable opportunity to bounce on a bed with a stiff Hugh Hefner. Madame Tussauds in London is the nearest thing to a British Walk of Fame. Unlike Hollywood&apos;s, however, here a star can disappear. The comings and goings of celebrity waxworks deliciously mirror the fickle wax and wane of fame. When his solo career imploded a decade ago, and Gary Barlow was reportedly &quot;melted down&quot; to make Britney Spears, the star concluded he had hit rock bottom. But this melting down is a &quot;complete myth&quot; according to Edwards. Now there are 12 Tussauds around the world, many models are sent on tour: a pop star may be down the dumper in Britain but still big in Berlin. According to Edwards, every unwanted waxwork is archived in a warehouse in Acton, west London \u2013 a fabulously creepy place that is off limits to the media. Former Australian PM John Howard was recently dumped there but the exhibition&apos;s prophetic creative director and others involved in the selection process chose to keep Muammar Gaddafi on display and this suddenly newsworthy figure stands between Fidel Castro and Yasser Arafat, just along from Saddam Hussein, Robert Mugabe and Adolf Hitler. Happily for Barlow, when Take That reformed, he was dusted down and reunited with the replica Robbie Williams. Tussauds confers more than immortality on leading celebrities: its biggest stars undertake a Doctor Who-like regeneration. Waxworkers may add a tattoo or amend a hairstyle, but often build an entirely new model to keep abreast of the ravages of ageing, image changes and plastic surgeons. Kylie has gone through four reincarnations; Michael Jackson, for obvious reasons, 13. For all the kids&apos; adulation for Cyrus and Efron, it is surprising how many young pilgrims are paying homage to the king of pop. Children have a surprising capacity for nostalgia, and reverence. The most visited figure remains the Queen. While Brad Pitt may get knickers left in his pocket, there is more decorum around the royals. Princess Diana is treated with great respect: the Versace gown she donated rarely needs dry-cleaning, unlike the oldest waxwork in the exhibition, Sleeping Beauty, aka Louis XV&apos;s mistress Madame du Barry. She recently had to be removed for a clean after someone sought to wake her with spilled coffee. The success of Madame Tussauds across three centuries is part of a long tradition of the tourism of replicas, simulations and spectacle. Its more recent blossoming may reflect a society increasingly obsessed with celebrity but it is also because, as its visitors soon realise, the division between static wax and interactive virtual reality is a false one. The exhibition has moved with the times, introducing Bollywood stars, who are a big draw, and interactive exhibits. Most crucially, it has ripped away the ropes and the &quot;do not touch&quot; strictures. Tussauds has always been 3D and its waxworks are now thoroughly, irreverently interactive. Ann Wootton from Walsall admits her grandchildren wondered what she was on about when she suggested a visit to the waxworks. Now they are enthralled. &quot;I&apos;m absolutely amazed how you can have photos and touch the models, which you couldn&apos;t do in previous years,&quot; says Wootton. &quot;It&apos;s lovely.&quot; In the 1880s, when Madame Tussauds moved to its current location, Chambers&apos;s Journal wrote that people did not flock there to admire statues and nor were they wowed by simple likeness in what was a new era of photography. Its appeal, the journalist concluded, lay in the liberation of the observer from the normal rules of politeness. At a time when voting was extended to more working men, its newly enfranchised visitors could rant at a disliked politician or stare impertinently into the eyes of royalty. And so it is today. Madame Tussauds has all the appeal of a fantasy dinner party in which heroes and villains from across the ages are gathered together in one room.

The future belongs to places such as New Songdo in South Korea, a wholly new city being built on an artificial island and linked by road bridge to Incheon international airport. And to 500 cities of the same size, as yet unborn, that China needs. And to Memphis, Tennessee, home of Fedex, and the UPS city of Louisville,\u00a0Kentucky. These, says Greg Lindsay, showing a suitably 21st-century indifference to the ancient Greek plural of &quot;polis&quot;, are &quot;aerotropoli&quot;. An aerotropolis is a city with an airport at its centre, rather than its periphery, &quot;a new kind of city, one native to our era of instant gratification \u2013 call it the instant age&quot;. It is &quot;a new phenomenon\u2026 reshaping the way we live and transforming the way we do business&quot;. Cities such as London, forever dithering over a third runway at Heathrow, and Los Angeles, where nimbies keep blocking the expansion of LAX, and New York, with sclerotic links from the city to its airports, are in trouble. Lindsay is a journalist fascinated by air travel. His co-author is John Kasarda, a business school professor with presumably lucrative consultancies telling countries, cities and businesses how to prepare for this new age. Lindsay wrote and did much of the exploration for Aerotropolis; Kasarda supplied much of the wisdom. The book tells how the world is rearranged by the logic of time, distance and cost. In 1974, for example, the Japanese Airlines executive Akira Okazaki used the spare capacity on cargo flights to fly whole chilled tuna around, leading to the world-wide consumption of sushi, with the result that bluefin tuna is now endangered in the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean. When political protests closed Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport, hotels ran out of imported milk and fish, but filled with orchids that could no longer be flown out. The authors address obvious counter-arguments. They do not accept that electronic communication will reduce demand for flying, instead pointing out that increased communication and increased travel have always gone together. If people make friends through Facebook, they may want to fly to meet up. Amazon stirs up a whirl of airborne goods, and business deals arranged by email need eye-contact and handshakes to be consummated. As for ecological objections, they argue that air transport causes a relatively small proportion of emissions. Roses imported to Britain from Holland, for example, are far more carbon-hungry than those from Kenya, because the hothouses and fertiliser needed to grow them outweigh the savings on fuel costs. Aerotropolis also describes the kinds of space formed by flight, the concourses and hubs that Douglas Coupland called &quot;an in-between place, a &apos;nowhere&apos;, a technicality\u2026 an anti-experience\u2026 like what happens to you just after you die and before you get shipped off to wherever you&apos;re going\u2026 pure neutrality made concrete&quot;. The patron saint of such places is George Clooney, as the flying, heartless, corporate assassin in Up in the Air. Walter Kim, author of the book on which the film was based, has contributed a plug for the front cover of Aerotropolis. &quot;Throw out your old atlas,&quot; it says. &quot;The new one is here.&quot; I have to say, I have heard much of this before: in Martin Pawley&apos;s Terminal Architecture of 1998, in Rem Koolhaas&apos;s S,M,L,XL(1995), in Deyan Sudjic&apos;s The 100 Mile City (1993), in Marc Aug\u00e9&apos;s Non-Places (1992), in the writings of JG Ballard, even in Alexander Korda&apos;s 1936 film of HG Wells&apos;s Things to Come. Despite all this historic futurology, there seem to be quite a lot of boring old cities around still doing reasonably well. The really interesting question is why the true aerotropolis, despite compelling reasons for its existence, is taking so long to get off the ground. The examples cited in the book are not completely convincing, and form an unintentional anti-prospectus for Kasarda&apos;s consultancy business. There is the city that was to be built next to Bangkok&apos;s airport, with advice from Kasarda, but didn&apos;t happen. Reunion, a development close to Denver international airport, &quot;a community specifically created for the pursuit of happiness&quot;, ended up with one of the highest foreclosure rates in the region. Wilmington, Ohio, lavishly wooed DHL with public money, only to be dumped when the company&apos;s profits went the wrong way. Memphis, despite the blessing of Fedex, &quot;still has a long way to go&quot;. There is the growth around Washington&apos;s Dulles airport, which owes as much to vast contracts from the Pentagon as to the airport. There\u00a0is\u00a0Dubai. It is hard, yet, to find a true aerotropolis, a thriving, rich city formed around an airport, outside the promotional spiels that promise New Songdo will be &quot;A cool city! A smart city!&quot;. Human factors, such as the fear of planes falling on your head, or attachment to a place, or political manoeuvring, or the persistence of non-aeronautic networks, counteract that other human factor, the desire for eye-contact, which seems to drive the immense machinery of air travel. The less spectacular truth is that cities have always relied on transport, but not on transport alone. Airports are a powerful force among others, and it is the interaction of these forces that makes cities interesting. Aerotropolis is straining too hard to be a smartypants bestseller of the the type produced by Malcolm Gladwell to explore this complexity. It is hectoring, breathless, over-persuading, a boring book with an interesting one struggling to get out. And it undermines itself in the authors&apos; biographical note: Lindsay lives not in Memphis or any other aerotropolis, but in Brooklyn, in the dinosaur city of New York \u2013 not, presumably, because of its airports.", "publicationDate": "2011-02-27T00:05:00Z", "tags": ["Art and design", "Society", "Architecture", "Books", "Business", "Culture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/feb/27/aerotropolis-greg-lindsay-john-kasarda-review", "title": "Aerotropolis: The Way We'll Live Next by Greg Lindsay and John Kasarda \u2013 review", "sentences": ["When political protests closed Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport, hotels ran out of imported milk and fish, but filled with orchids that could no longer be flown out.", "There is the city that was to be built next to Bangkok&apos;s airport, with advice from Kasarda, but didn&apos;t happen."]}, {"article": "And then there was one. Of the three brave Pakistani politicians who stood up for Aasia Bibi, an embattled Christian woman flung on to death row last year, just one is still alive: Sherry Rehman. The liberal parliamentarian from Karachi, known for her glamorous style and outspoken views, spearheaded efforts to reform the much-abused blasphemy law after Bibi, a mother of four, was sentenced to death for allegedly insulting the prophet Muhammad. Rehman, 50, was joined in her lonely struggle by two men \u2013 the Punjab governor, Salmaan Taseer, and the minorities minister, Shahbaz Bhatti. Now both of them are dead and worries are growing that Rehman is next. &quot;Make no mistake: she is in grave danger, like nobody else,&quot; one friend said. Rehman, is currently in New Delhi, visiting the Indian capital for a conference, in a rare public appearance. Since Taseer was gunned down by his guard outside an Islamabad cafe on 4 January she has lived in near hiding. She spent most of January holed up inside her Karachi home, surrounded by police and advised by senior government ministers to flee Pakistan lest she be assassinated. &quot;I get two types of advice about leaving,&quot; she said then. &quot;One from concerned friends, the other from those who want me out so I&apos;ll stop making trouble. But I&apos;m going nowhere.&quot; In February she flew to Bangkok for a meeting on Pakistan-India relations; then more recently to the Indian capital. But at home in Pakistan she is largely absent from public life. She flies to Islamabad discreetly, but rarely appears in parliament. Her movements have become secret, highlighting how a vibrant voice has been silenced by intolerant forces some warn could entirely suffocate Pakistan&apos;s fragile democracy. &quot;We are the knife&apos;s edge. A clerical tsunami is headed towards us,&quot; liberal academic Pervez Hoodbhoy told a literature festival in Karachi last month. Ironically, although many people have died as a result of blasphemy since the military dictator General Zia ul Haq made it a capital offence in the 1980s, none have been hanged under the law itself. Instead dozens of blasphemy suspects, the majority of them Muslims, have been murdered, either while standing trial, in prison or after returning home. It&apos;s not just them \u2013 judges are fearful of ruling in blasphemy cases, fearing they too will be targeted. In 1997, militants in Lahore gunned down a high court judge in his chambers as reprisal for having acquitted a Christian man on blasphemy charges three years earlier. Now is the turn of the politicians, who are running for cover. Since the Bibi furore erupted, the ruling Pakistan Peoples party has strenuously avoided the issue, politically abandoning politicians who dare support reform. Taseer, who found himself isolated in the last weeks of his life, has not been accorded the normal honours in the country&apos;s parliament; even allies who privately support his stand remain silent in public. Critics say Rehman was rash in proposing legal reforms, that she attacked a sensitive issue too bluntly. &quot;There&apos;s never a right time,&quot; she retorted in January. &quot;Blasphemy cases are continually popping up, more horror stories from the ground. How do you ignore them?&quot; Now, friends say, Rehman is likely to face a deluge of fresh advice to shun the limelight. Less clear is how long she can remain out of sight. As history has shown, and Wednesday&apos;s events underline, Pakistan&apos;s flourishing forces of extremism can wait as long as it takes. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 March 2011 to clarify details of Rehman&apos;s visits to parliament", "publicationDate": "2011-03-02T19:11:34Z", "tags": ["Pakistan's blasphemy laws", "Pakistan", "Taliban", "Al-Qaida", "Islam", "Christianity", "Religion", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/02/sherry-rehman-pakistan-blasphemy-laws-hitlist", "title": "Sherry Rehman next on Pakistan militants' hitlist, friends fear", "sentences": ["But I&apos;m going nowhere.&quot; In February she flew to Bangkok for a meeting on Pakistan-India relations; then more recently to the Indian capital."]}, {"article": "   Warisara Sornpet.    I often saw my mother \u2013 who raised me and my brother all by herself \u2013 come home from work at dawn. I also saw my grandmother work day in day out until she passed away at 63, having also raised all of her 7 children on her own. However, in our early 30s, few of us seriously think about having kids just yet. Women our age are too busy doing their masters, working overtime and doing yoga. When I was little, I was told by most adults not to talk back or show anger, but to be pleasant. Once at school, the teachers prepared us girls for a rock concert saying, &quot;Don&apos;t dance.

Now in 2011, where modern-day values of equality are supposedly being practised, my journalist friend tells she still doesn&apos;t get paid as much as her male counterparts.

Outside of Bangkok, grandmothers work alongside men in the fields, raising their grandchildren with the money they get from selling crops. In my university years, I volunteered to teach in rural schools. In the open field, as the sun was setting under a golden sky, young girls told me they never wanted to leave home, but that one day they would go to work in Bangkok and send a lot of money home. Today, young girls from the north and the north-east still flock to Bangkok looking for work. Unfortunately, every year some enter the sex trade and are open to exploitation. Pornography is still being sold openly on the city&apos;s streets.

When we wrote last Thursday that Bin Hammam, pictured below, would soon declare, readers were invited to express whom they believed should run Fifa. There were 3,731 votes cast and nine out of 10 were in favour of the challenger. Digger asked Bin Hammam for his reaction. &quot;It is more positive daily; I\u00a0am more and more convinced and I\u00a0am more encouraged by the poll,&quot; he said. That conversation was last Friday; yesterday he released a statement through Twitter: &quot;I will clarify my position regarding the Fifa presidency elections, which take place in June 2011. I will hold a press conference on Friday, 18 March, at 1300 hours at AFC House.&quot; Suggestions that Bin Hammam might be a stalking horse for another candidate are unlikely to prove true. As revealed here last week, the Qatari&apos;s attempt to persuade the Uefa president, Michel Platini, to stand against Blatter was rejected. The Qatari has also spoken to Franz Beckenbauer, the World Cup winner who is standing down from the Fifa executive committee this year, and Ricardo Teixeira, the Brazilian federation president. Both declined to stand, though neither is believed to be a\u00a0staunch supporter of Blatter. With the Korean Fifa vice-president Chung Mong-joon also on his way out of football politics, no credible potential challengers remain. If Bin Hammam is to see the change he craves at Fifa House, he will have to force it himself. Sepp spreads his wings As Sepp Blatter faces the sternest challenge yet to his 13-year grip on the Fifa presidency, he is putting in the air miles in Fifa&apos;s name. And where should be his first port of call? Well, the president is in Burma, in what the Bangkok Post described on Monday as &quot;a diplomatic coup for the military junta&quot;. Blatter is in Burma to open a new football academy as the guest of the businessman Zaw Zaw, whom Wikileaks cables described as &quot;a regime crony&quot;. Then, according to the report, he will head off to &quot;the secretive, new capital Naypyidaw, where he will meet the president-elect Thein Sein as well as the football-mad military supremo, Than Shwe&quot;. Introduced to football fans by Wikileaks, for having prepared a bid for Manchester United, Shwe is the head of the Tatmadaw army that employs a &quot;shoot on sight&quot; practice that targets civilians in conflict areas, according to Human Rights Watch. Blatter, no doubt, will now be able to count on the\u00a0Burmese vote in the 1 June election, and he can add it to another that he is already guaranteed. It was Somalia \u2013 where Human Rights Watch says &quot;a humanitarian crisis\u00a0exists across the country&quot; \u2013 that gave Blatter his presidential nomination on 3 March. Manifesto destiny As Bin Hammam discusses a closer integration of clubs into the decision-making structures of world football \u2013 as a central tenet of his presidential manifesto \u2013 Blatter has given an outline of his own intended programme, should\u00a0he win the election. Ten days ago, at an International Football Association Board meeting, he said: &quot;For my next four years I will dedicate my work\u00a0to the social and cultural\u00a0impact of football in\u00a0society.&quot; Who could ask for\u00a0more? Pilgrims in peril A high court case brought out of the blue by HM Revenue &amp; Customs yesterday led to the remarkable admission by counsel for the administrator of Plymouth Argyle that there is &quot;unlikely&quot; to be any money available for unsecured creditors in the League One club&apos;s insolvency. HMRC was seeking a court ruling to declare the football creditors rule unlawful, only five days after a Football Association board member, David Gill, told a parliamentary select committee that the controversial rule had &quot;had its day&quot;.Lawyers for Argyle&apos;s administrator informed the court by letter and in the hearing that since secured creditors are owed up to \u00a35m, there will be no cash left for unsecured creditors, such as HMRC. Since football creditors are in insolvency law unsecured (their claims are secured by football&apos;s rules alone) this is a stark admission that the club&apos;s existence is under serious threat.

Your donations will enable Cardiff Foodbank to feed those in a short term crises such as debt, redundancy and domestic violence, resulting in reduced crime, less homelessness and preventing family breakdown.

Amusingly, Hernandez could have been playing in France rather than England, since Paris Saint-Germain were offered the chance to sign him before United \u2026 but turned him down on the grounds that the asking price was suspiciously low, a brilliantly stereotypical piece of Parisian reasoning. As for brilliantly stereotypical Ferguson reasoning, well, United&apos;s manager has offered plenty of that again this season. And the Scot&apos;s bitter outburst against referee Martin Atkinson following United&apos;s defeat at Chelsea earlier this month this afternoon resulted in swingeing action: a five-match touchline ban and a 30k fine, which will be music to the ears of the many Rafa Benitez-alikes who believe Ferguson is a law to himself. The ears of whichever poor unfortunates Ferguson ends up sitting beside for the duration of his imminent ban are, by contrast, likely to be assailed by fruity oaths. QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;It was a truly horrible moment, when I conceded the goal I wanted to leave right away, to go straight to Milan by foot, or even on horseback&quot; - Julio Cesar poetically explains his blunder in last night&apos;s game against Bayern. The Fiver can&apos;t imagine many British keepers being as eloquent. GOOD LUCK, CAPTAIN MARVEL Bryan Robson, arguably the finest English footballer of his generation and a fearsome box-to-box midfielder in his prime, is battling cancer. Robson, who is currently Thailand&apos;s national team manager, underwent an operation to remove a tumour from his throat on 3 March in a Bangkok hospital, a spokesman for Manchester United confirmed today. The Fiver could enter into the usual blandishments about how Robson&apos;s battling qualities as a player should help him in his fight with the illness but the truth is that cancer kills the strong as well the weak, takes brave people but leaves cowards. What we can do though is concentrate on the facts - and the United spokesman confirmed that Robson&apos;s surgeons say the condition is &quot;treatable&quot; and that he is well enough to continue his day-to-day duties. &quot;At this moment, Bryan is fine to continue with his role as Thailand coach and his role as ambassador of Manchester United. Bryan and family have requested that he can continue with his treatment in private and ask that their privacy is respected.&quot; The Fiver would struggle to fit all Robson&apos;s honours into four paragraphs but the highlights include helping United to two Premier League titles, three FA Cups and the European Cup Winners&apos; Cup. He also made 90 appearances for England - it would have been many more but for injuries - 65 of which were as captain. Robson&apos;s managerial career has been derided, often by the Fiver, but it would be churlish not to mention that in 1997 his Middlesbrough side reached both the FA Cup and League Cup finals. Millions of football fans around the world are hoping he can add the title of cancer survivor to his list of achievements. DOUBLE YOUR MONEY WITH BLUE SQUARE!

FIVER LETTERS &quot;Good on Richard Paley (yesterday&apos;s Fiver letters) for having the courage to take a stand and highlight the London-based media&apos;s willful ignorance of Manchester United&apos;s achievements. Living in the capital as I do, it can be weeks at a time before I see them mentioned in print, or indeed on TV, not to mention anyone in a replica shirt (they really ought to push those more). But perhaps this is a time for self-reflection as well? Maybe if the club, its managers, its players and most of all its fans were a bit less bashful and attention-shy, we might all notice them more often?&quot; - David Hopkins. &quot;Re. Yesterday&apos;s cheap (read hilarious) joke at the expense of lovely Vanessa Paradis: may I point Paul Doyle towards Nessa&apos;s eponymously-titled third album which was actually quite good (in parts). Whether this had anything to do with the fact that she was romantically involved with Lenny Kravitz (who wrote, produced and performed on the LP) at the time I shall leave up to you&quot; - James Thompson (and approximately 100,057 other Vanessa Paradis fans). &quot;Martin Blogg (yesterday&apos;s Fiver letters) might have missed the memo revoking the memo, but you can sort of forgive his ignorance given that Portsmouth going belly up meant that they never got a Uefa license for this season, whilst in the previous season Everton qualified via the league anyway. Rest assured though, one of Bolton or Stoke are going to be in Europe next season, one way or another&quot; Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And if you&apos;ve nothing better to do you can also tweet the Fiver. BITS AND BOBS Kenny Dalglish expects Braga defender Kaka to be disciplined for his elbow on Andy Carroll. &quot;Regarding Andy Carroll and impact, the biggest impact was what I was asked about after the game about him getting caught with the elbow from Kaka,&quot; said Dalglish, with admirable contempt for the basics of syntax. &quot;If there is no retribution from Uefa it will be a real surprise for me.&quot; Firewall FC are looking for a new manager after they dismissed Ian Baraclough. The club are currently third from bottom in the Championship, four points off safety. And an injury crisis may force Manchester United into playing John O&apos;Sh ... Michael Carrick in defence. &quot;It did get a mention in the changing room,&quot; said Carrick, sounding like he was talking about something way more interesting. &quot;I said to Mike Phelan, &apos;I don&apos;t fancy that again&apos;.&quot; STILL WANT MORE? If Marseille could finish, then Manchester United would be out of Big Cup for another year, reckons Paul Wilson. Jonathan Wilson knows so much about Argentinian football that &quot;El Wilson&quot; is Buenos Aires slang for &quot;He who salivates over false No9s&quot; so listen up when he salutes Cesar Luis Menotti, the much-loved chain-smoking manager and true intellectual of the game.

Then it&apos;s back to his for breakfast, softening up said journalist with an omelette. The London version is more prosaic. Preparing for the premiere of his new film Limitless, Cooper flops down on a sofa in his hotel suite, feet up on the coffee table, midriff exposed (I don&apos;t think he notices). Berocca vitamin drink in hand, he lets out an easy drawl: &quot;What about this room? Jesus Christ, this room is so opulent. It&apos;s ridiculous.&quot; Which is true: a garishly twee oil painting of cute birds hangs behind him. Cooper is not a household name, not yet anyway. His effortless performances as a badass in both Wedding Crashers and The Hangover may have catapulted him into Hollywood&apos;s big league, but what hasn&apos;t been so easy, he says, is getting the industry to see past all that off-the-leash, bad-taste humour. &quot;People go, &apos;Isn&apos;t he just the guy from The Hangover?&apos;&quot; Which is fine up to a point because, despite featuring no big-name stars, The Hangover was massive, the highest-grossing R-rated comedy ever \u2013 a story of three guys on a stag weekend in Vegas who wake up sans groom, with a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the wardrobe, and J\u00e4germeister-and-Rophenol hangovers. At 36, Cooper must know that he can&apos;t play man-boys for ever. Moreover, unlike his funny co-stars (Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms et al), he never set out to be a comic actor: until recently, he says, he took whatever work was offered. The new film Limitless, in which he appears alongside his acting hero Robert De Niro, is his meatiest role yet: a chance to prove he has got more going for him than locker-room good looks. Does he feel like his leading-man mettle is being put to the test? &quot;Yeah, well, we&apos;ll see. This is an opportunity to prove that.&quot; You might have seen some of the posters for Limitless: a rip-off of vitamin supplement ads, they offer the grandiose promise of &quot;the perfect version of you&quot;. There&apos;s a shot of Cooper looking tanned and goal-achieving alongside a list of side effects: psychosis, homicidal blackouts, sudden death, etc. Nowhere is the movie mentioned \u2013 this poster is daring you to be interested enough to look up the website. Cooper plays a writer who&apos;s been chewing on his debut novel for a decade, going nowhere until he bumps into an old drug-dealing buddy who gives him an unlicensed super-pill, NZT. The plot is a play on the specious statistic that we only use 10% of our brains (&quot;Anyone who believes that probably is,&quot; says one psychiatrist). Taking NZT, this no-hoper becomes unstoppable: he can recall everything he&apos;s ever read; he finishes writing a genius novel in four days; he learns French in an apr\u00e8s-midi. Even his misspent hours watching Bruce Lee twirling nunchucks are put to use when Russian mobsters come after his stash. He makes a fortune on Wall Street, becoming the protege of uber-billionaire De Niro (who, inexplicably, is called Van Loon). There are side effects, of course, and by the end the whole thing\u00a0has a very 1980s American Psycho cocaine paranoia to it. The premise is irresistible: don&apos;t we all secretly believe that we&apos;ve got some buried-away genius waiting to be unleashed? Equally pleasing is the thought that some shadowy Bilderberg-style group is necking pharmaceuticals to stay on top. Ah-ha, so that explains Mark Zuckerberg&apos;s savant genius. &quot;Or Bill Gates, Richard Branson, Steve Jobs,&quot; chirps Cooper. He takes his feet off the coffee table, crosses his arms and pulls a stern face: &quot;Then you&apos;ve got Rupert Murdoch who is going, &apos;Where did all these guys come from?&apos;&quot; Limitless will not disappoint Cooper&apos;s man-fans (and there are plenty of them). Like the guy-comedies that have made him so bankable, and whose charm lies in their sweary but ultimately unrisky wholesomeness, all the hard work goes on beneath a jock-ish, jokey surface. Cooper has been dating Ren\u00e9e Zellweger. So what&apos;s the most scurrilous thing he has read about himself? &quot;Scurrilous, what&apos;s that? Like scandalous? I never heard that. How do you spell it? S-c-u-r-r . . . ?&quot; Cooper is good with deflective shots like that \u2013 the day after we meet, gossip mags report that they have split. Does he have a hard time with paparazzi? No, it doesn&apos;t bother him. &quot;The only thing that&apos;s different now is that my mother lives with me, and she didn&apos;t ask for it\u00a0all.&quot; At the end of last year, Cooper\u00a0moved back in with his parents Gloria and Charles for four months to be close to his dad, who died of lung cancer in January. His mum has been travelling with him ever since. &quot;Except to here. She&apos;s back in Philly. But I&apos;m Italian, so that&apos;s just the way it is.&quot; He grew up Philadelphia, the only blond-haired kid in an extended family\u00a0of Italians, meaning everyone thought\u00a0he was a girl. His mum is Italian-American, his dad Irish-American, and no one from his family had ever acted. &quot;The idea I was going to be an actor scared the shit out of my parents. My dad was the first one to go to college in his neighbourhood. He built a nice life. He was a stockbroker \u2013 and then his son wants to be an actor?&quot; Cooper senior was, however, a film buff, and his 12-year-old son got the acting bug after watching John Hurt in David Lynch&apos;s The Elephant Man. Is the demi-mane a hindrance? Cooper took a degree in English before moving to New York to study acting, making his first TV appearance before graduation, in an early episode of Sex and the City as one of Sarah Jessica Parker&apos;s squeezes. &quot;No tongues,&quot; he was told. You do wonder if the piercing blue eyes and demi-mane of blond hair have hindered him when it comes to being taken seriously. The question provokes a burst of guffawing. &quot;That&apos;s bullshit. I can tell by the way you&apos;re asking, you know it&apos;s not true.&quot; No one has ever told him he is too good-looking for a role. Ever. &quot;In fact, I&apos;ve always fallen between the cracks of not being good-looking enough for certain roles and not odd-looking enough for other roles.&quot; Which can&apos;t be entirely true, since he was cast as lover-boy Faceman in last year&apos;s A-Team remake. Back in 2005, though, it was Wedding Crashers and his locker-room-aggressive character Sack Lodge that got Cooper his Hollywood breakthrough. &quot;I loved playing that role. It was the first major movie I&apos;d been part of it. I was acting with Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson and Christopher Walken.&quot; He backslaps the sofa. &quot;It was insane. And\u00a0I get to play the heavy.&quot; Equally alpha but less sociopathic was Phil, ringmaster of bachelor-party bacchanalia in The Hangover. Both roles added another dimension to his screen presence, a kind of wry knowingness: yes, the camera loves me; yes, women love me; yes, men love me; yes, I&apos;m an asshole; yes, so what? Phil in The Hangover, he says, was his hardest role. &quot;That guy is so different from me. I&apos;m always amazed by it, actually. When I look at that character on screen, I don&apos;t see me at all.&quot; He admits a lot is riding on Limitless. &quot;This movie is dependent upon me much more solely to tell the story. So if it&apos;s successful, hopefully more people will allow me the opportunity to tell that kind of story. You know what I mean?&quot; He has not long finished filming The Hangover Part II, reportedly for a fee of $5m; he&apos;s keen to point out it&apos;s not a no-brainer sequel. &quot;This was not a knee-jerk reaction. We met many times to discuss the script. And it was the hardest movie I&apos;ve ever done.&quot; How? &quot;It was like Apocalypse Now: the Comedy. They could make a documentary \u2013 like Hearts of Darkness by Coppola&apos;s wife \u2013 about it.&quot; Hangover 2 is set in Bangkok, a city famous for its cultural landmarks as well as for sleaze and sex tourism. He won&apos;t go into details, but it doesn&apos;t take a genius on a miracle pill to guess what side of the city the overgrown frat-boys will be lured into. \u2022 Limitless is out today.

The Little Book of How to Win a World Cup says that a triumphant campaign should start slowly and crescendo imperiously, like an epic five-minute song. England have done things a little differently at this tournament: they have crammed four choruses and a guitar solo into the first 90 seconds, and it&apos;s hard to believe that they have been through so much merely to reach the quarter-finals.  The fact that they have done so makes this game even harder to predict. On the one hand they are utterly exhausted after five months on tour; on the other they are playing with a wild-eyed desperation and, paradoxically, a freedom that makes very dangerous. Throughout this World Cup England have been on the lam, running from rhyme, reason and an absurd injury list. Such a lifestyle usually ends with a bullet between the eyes \u2013 and, when England do go out of this tournament, you suspect it might be after a crushing defeat, the whole thing collapsing dramatically\u00a0\u2013 but they are well capable of taking a couple more teams down with them. That said, let&apos;s not get carried away: Sri Lanka are an exceptional team who would be favourites even if they didn&apos;t have home advantage, even if they weren&apos;t playing against a team who are feeling the considerable effects of an inhumane schedule, and even if they didn&apos;t have one rubber-wristed genius. If England are to win today, they are going to have to muzzle Murali. Best of luck with that, gentlemen.  The winner of today&apos;s match will play New Zealand in Colombo on Tuesday. And while the Kiwis were great yesterday, you&apos;d certainly be happy to face them in the last four.  Ordinarily, when I pack my lunchbox for work, I include some fruit, a smoothie, some corn-based goodness and some fizzy pop. Today I dispensed with all that nonsense and simply added valium, nurofen, a bottle of brandy, another bottle of brandy, a third bottle of brandy, a set of fake nails that can be munched to the quick, and the number of an on-call doctor. In view of England&apos;s tournament thus far, I would suggest preparing the same.  England have won the toss and will bat first. That is, at least historically, a huge toss to win: of the 49 completed games on this ground, a staggering 73 per cent have been won by the team batting first. England are unchanged \u2013 unchanged! \u2013 but have switched the batting order: Ian Bell will open the batting. Sri Lanka have picked three frontline spinners, with Rangana Herath coming into the side for Nuwan Kulasekera. Three spinners. That scares me. It scares me almost as much as the &apos;Kiri Kiri!&apos; scene in Audition.  Sri Lanka Tharanga, Dilshan, Sangakkara (c/wk), Jayawardene, Samaraweera, Silva, Mathews, Malings, Herath, Mendis, Muralitharan. England Strauss (c), Bell, Trott, Bopara, Morgan, Prior (wk), Wright, Bresnan, Swann, Tredwell, Tremlett.  Dodgy omens department The last time England played in a World Cup quarter-final was in 1996. It was against Sri Lanka. It was on a Saturday morning. They batted first. And they were slaughtered.  How are the nerves? I am conscious that this attitude will do well to survive the first over, but I honestly think that we should just enjoy today&apos;s game regardless of what happens. It could be the end of the craziest, most brilliant winter of English cricket for decades. When we are old and doddery and in the home talking to our imaginary grandchildren, the winter of 2010-11 will sit alongside the one that got away and Eldorado among urgent topics of conversation. These are a fantastic set of blokes, who have already achieved one very special thing: they have so nearly made us proud to be English they won the Ashes in Australia for the first time since 1986-87. If they can add the World Cup, great; if not, it will still have been one for the imaginary grandchildren. When England go out of major football tournaments, the BBC usually have a montage ready, soundtracked by some melancholy ditty: there was Walkaway by Cast in 1996 and Stop Crying Your Heart Out in 2002. So we need a song today, just in the case the thinkable should happen. Current favourites are End Of The Road by Boyz II Men \u2013 the best cheesy ballad ever, end of and fact \u2013 and, for something a little sadder, The Album Leaf&apos;s Twenty Two Fourteen. Which is, coincidentally, the number of days that England have been on tour.              &quot;Can we some Trololo to get the party started?&quot; asks Jamie Jermain. Damn straight. Let&apos;s just enjoy today. Let&apos;s Trolololololo our way through the inevitable six-wicket defeat and celebrate the winter of 2010-11, our very own English cricket road trip.  Urgent 8.59am update Sod all that hippy nonsense about enjoying the game. Come on England!  1st over: England 5-0 (Strauss 1, Bell 4) Ready? Me either, but let&apos;s do this! It&apos;ll be Lasith Malinga to open the bowling. Strauss takes a single off the second ball, and then Bell times his first delivery off the pads and through square leg for four. That&apos;s a beautiful stroke, and he is a very important man today because he is capable of getting England off to a flyer before the spinners come on. &quot;I don&apos;t believe I have ever physically punched the air over winning the toss as I did this morning,&quot; says Steve Betteley. &quot;The battle fever is truly on. Anyhow, for the song, how about You&apos;re Tender and You&apos;re Tired by Manic Street Preachers. Apt title, melancholic lyrics and a vaguely uplifting tune. it does also contain the line &apos;its not trivial like they think&apos; and I would dare anyone to go up to Graeme Smith this morning and tell him &apos;it&apos;s just a silly game&apos; - just to see what happens.&quot;  2nd over: England 5-0 (Strauss 1, Bell 4) This is interesting. At the toss, Andrew Strauss said he thought Sri Lanka were unlikely to open with spin \u2013 so inevitably, for the first time in the tournament, they will open with a spinner. It&apos;s Tillakaratne Dilshan, the part-time offspinner, and Strauss \u2013 who was out in the first over to spin against South Africa \u2013 can&apos;t get him away at all. It&apos;s a maiden.  3rd over: England 7-0 (Strauss 2, Bell 5) England often struggle when it comes to setting a target. Today they need to do that most English of things \u2013 set their sights low. They should have around 250 in mind, which means they don&apos;t need to overreach, or panic during the slow periods. Like this one. Malinga sends down a good slower yorker that Bell digs out, and there are just two singles from the over. &quot;Would you say 5am is too early or too late to start drinking?&quot; says Barry Bryan. It&apos;s the drinker&apos;s mezzanine, where you can justify it either way. Go for it.  4th over: England 9-0 (Strauss 3, Bell 6) Strauss is sent back after a wonderful stop in the covers for Silva, whose throw to the keeper then hits the retreating Strauss. I think he&apos;d have been okay. Strauss then gives Dilshan the charge and drags an inside edge to square leg for a single. That&apos;s one of just two singles from the over. Sri Lanka have started very well. &quot;Morning Rob,&quot; says Brad McMillan. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if we saw mind games from Strauss at the toss. He commented so quickly that Sri Lanka would open with seamers, it seemed like he wanted the exact opposite. Who&apos;s opening with Strauss? Oh, only our best player of spin.&quot; I hadn&apos;t thought about that, but it makes perfect sense now you mention it. Not going too well, though, is it?  5th over: England 17-0 (Strauss 3, Bell 14) Angelo Mathews replaces Lasith Malinga, and Bell times his first ball beautifully through midwicket for four. He is a logical ODI opener really, a pinch-stroker in the image of Mark Waugh and Sachin Tendulkar. He just needs to free his mind a touch in this role, I would say. Listen to me, telling Ian Ronald Bell what to do. Bell adds two more twos, a flick behind square and a force through the covers. &quot;When England went out of Italia 90 the Beeb used Elegia by New Order,&quot; says Paul King. &quot;It brings a tear to my eye just thinking about it\u2026&quot; I missed that. I was too busy taking my frustration out on all things Germans, doing really nasty things like overcooking bratwursts and pouring Lowenbrau down the loo. Take that &quot;Lothar&quot;!  6th over: England 21-0 (Strauss 4, Bell 17) Bell has started well but Strauss is struggling to work the ball around, particularly against Dilshan. After three dot balls, he charges Dilshan again and drags an inside edge to leg for one. Bell pushes two into the covers and then anothr down the ground. He has 17 from 21 balls, Strauss 4 from 15.&quot;This is some inhumane schedule you&apos;re on yourself at the moment... what is the record for consecutive OBOs anyway?&quot; says Lynn Bashforth. &quot;I am all of a blether perched here on the edge of my sofa. I don&apos;t know what to expect apart from the unexpected. What money the Super Over today then? It&apos;s about the only thing this England team hasn&apos;t delivered to us yet.&quot; Please no.  7th over: England 26-0 (Strauss 4, Bell 22) Bell waits for Mathews&apos; slower ball and then slams an authoritative cut for four. He has started extremely well.&quot;Following from a conference in Prague,&quot; says Jim Stock. &quot;And if anyone out there can recommend a good cricket bar in Prague to watch the closing stages, would be much appreciated.&quot;  WICKET! England 29-1 (Strauss b Dilshan 5) Bell drives a single from Dilshan&apos;s first ball, which means more slow torture for Strauss. He is really struggling \u2013 and now he&apos;s gone! He missed a mighty hoick at a quicker delivery that skidded on to hit middle and leg. That wicket was not so much in the post as sent by recorded delivery. &quot;Strauss is put out of his misery&quot; says Nasser Hussain. It was a horrible innings, five from 19 balls, but that happens to the best of them. It was also outstanding work from Dilshan and Sangakkara.  8th over: England 29-1 (Bell 24, Trott 0) Dilshan&apos;s figures are now 4-1-9-1. I think we can call that experiment a success. &quot;No offence to England fans here,&quot; begins Stephen Daly, &quot;but as a Kiwi, I&apos;ll be pulling for England to improve on their slow start and nick a win, based on their record in this cup against international cricket&apos;s lesser lights. And as with all statements preceded by &quot;no offence&quot;, you should of course be rather offended.&quot;  WICKET! England 31-2 (Bell c Samarweera b Mathews 25) Bell screws a drive off Mathews straight to short midwicket, and now England do have a problem. That was a tame dismissal really. I don&apos;t know if it stopped on the wicket or not; either way, it&apos;s a big blow because Bell was playing nicely.  9th over: England 31-2 (Trott 1, Bopara 0) You know that supply of valium... &quot;That&apos;s just classic airhead Ian Bell isn&apos;t it?&quot; sniffs Domink Hindal.  10th over: England 32-2 (Trott 2, Bopara 0) The left-arm spinner Rangana Herath replaces Dilshan. A very accurate first over to Trott yields just a single. Sri Lanka are all over England at the moment. These are really nervous times. One more quick wicket and the whole thing could come crashing down like a Jenga tower that has just had an accidental collision with a baseball bat. &quot;Just got into work and pulled up the OBO and TMS,&quot; says Simon Robinson. &quot;First thing I heard upon starting the stream was &apos;He&apos;s got a magnificent growth.&apos; I&apos;m desperately hoping that I missed a contextual discussion of beards, or else reason and propriety has been abandoned by even the Beeb in these stressful times.&quot; Wibble.  11th over: England 35-2 (Trott 5, Bopara 0) Russel Arnold, the Sri Lankan commentator, reckons England need about 240 or 250 to be competitive. This would be a heck of a day for a spine-tingler from Eoin Morgan. At the moment, England can feel the soil falling over their head. Trott relieves a bit of pressure by smacking one down the ground for three, aided by some poor fielding from Malinga. &quot;It seems that post-knockout music is another area that the BBC outclasses ITV,&quot; says Charles Courtney. &quot;In 1998, when England were knocked out of the World Cup, ITV played &apos;Good Riddance&apos; by Green Day. Not the sentiment I was expecting.&quot; I&apos;m sure the rest of the world were nodding there head sagely, mind.  12th over: England 42-2 (Trott 8, Bopara 4) There&apos;s an almighty din around the ground, an incessant honking of horns. Coupled with the heat and humidity, it&apos;s certainly no country for hungover men. Trott laps Herath for a couple, and then Bopara gets off the mark with a superb, fleet-footed cut for four. &quot;Currently in Colombo (on a work trip, sadly, but, happily, staying in the same hotel as the England team),&quot; says Mike Stewart. &quot;I am duty bound to report that the Sri Lankan Dirty Tricks Department whirred into action last night \u2013 there was an enormously loud concert in the hotel grounds which went on to about 2am, doubtless designed to keep our brave boys awake. They looked OK this morning, though, albeit that Colly&apos;s facial hair gave some cause for concern. I am hoping that he has shaved, but I can&apos;t get to a TV at the moment. Any chance of a Colly Beard Update?&quot; The moment he comes on with a drink, I&apos;ll let you know.  13th over: England 44-2 (Trott 9, Bopara 5) Two singles from Mathews&apos; over. How are the fingernails? It&apos;s slow progress, but stay calm. This is okay for now. WE&apos;RE NOT BEING HUMILIATED! &quot;Cricket in Prague,&quot; says Trevor Marshall. &quot;It&apos;s on here.&quot; Michaela adds that &quot;The Golden Star near Wenceslas Square used to show the cricket if enough people asked for it.&quot; Thanks, both of you.  14th over: England 44-2 (Trott 9, Bopara 5) Bopara survives a huge LBW appeal from Herath, and Kumar Sangakkara decides against the review. It was a lovely delivery that straightened as Bopara pushed around his front pad, and I&apos;m very surprised they didn&apos;t review that. The next ball skids straight on to beat Bopara&apos;s attempted slap and miss the off stump by a whisker. This is great stuff from Herath, a maiden. They have just shown the earlier appeal, and Bopara would have survived\u00a0\u2013 the ball was hitting a good portion of leg stump, but it would have gone with the on-field call.  15th over: England 46-2 (Trott 10, Bopara 6) Here comes Ajantha Mendis, the mystery spinner, and there&apos;s another big appeal against the struggling Bopara. This time it&apos;s for a stumping, when he misses a defensive push at a legspinner. Sangakkara was extremely confident, because Bopara had lifted his back foot at one stage. It went to the third umpire, and replays showed that Bopara dragged his foot down just in time. England are hangiong on grimly at the moment, and Trott also survives a stumping appeal when he is beaten by a majestic googly. Billy Doctrove decides not to refer it. &quot;As there surely aren&apos;t many Sri Lankans tuned in to the OBO, do you think you could announce England wicket losses in lower case italics?&quot; says Johnny Dixon. &quot;To slowly whisper the creeping disappointment as it crushes all hope. Obviously retain block caps bold for the second innings, to ramp up the bombast, as we enter the dreadful end period of mining the last grains of &apos;maybe maybe&apos; hopefulness.&quot; Ha. It does seem a bit inappropriate. I remember once, at Victoria train station, they had a warning along the lines of &apos;Don&apos;t get too close to the track \u2013 you could die!!&apos;. Seriously, two exclamation marks. Anyone seen anything similarly inappropriate?  16th over: England 51-2 (Trott 13, Bopara 8) Another over, another huge appeal turned down \u2013 and this time there will be a review. Trott pushed around a straight one from Herath, and this will be extremely close. Did it straighten enough to hit leg stump? No it didn&apos;t! It was hitting the outside of leg stump, so the on-field call stands and Trott survives. England are living right on the edge at the moment. Still, not to worry: Murali will be on soon. &quot;Optimism department,&quot; says Sara Torvalds, and I&apos;m looking forward to seeing where she&apos;s going with this one. &quot;This is brilliant captaining by Straussy and strategic planning by Andy Flower. They had it planned all along (that&apos;s why Bell was Straussy&apos;s opening partner): two quick wickets to get the boys fired up - they&apos;ve realised that this particular England squad plays badly when thins are easy, and they figured playing Sri Lanka at home wasn&apos;t enough of a challenge, so they made it nine batsmen play XI. And then it will go to the Super Over.&quot; It is goes to a Super Over, I will almost certainly faint, brandy/valium cocktail or no brandy/valium cocktail.  17th over: England 56-2 (Trott 16, Bopara 10) On commentary, Ian Botham wants England to be more positive against spin, perhaps like the time he tried to heave Trevor Hohns across the Pennines before he had scored in a vital Ashes Test, but it&apos;s easier said than done. Trott back cuts three, aided by a misfield, and there are five from the over. &quot;The worst hangover I have ever suffered was in the oppressive humidity of Colombo,&quot; winces Alex Wright. &quot;The deep-seated feelings of regret and remorse still live with me today. Also in the process of booking in your subcontinental hangover, if a Sri Lankan tuk-tuk driver suggests you go to a karaoke bar, don&apos;t go.&quot;  18th over: England 60-2 (Trott 19, Bopara 11) Herath skids one past Trott&apos;s attemped cut. Four from the over, all in ones and twos, and it&apos;s time for a drink. Hic. &quot;Watching this farce of an attempt to bat just brings home what a phenomenal series win it was in 2001,&quot; says Jonathan Hungin. &quot;How the eff did Nasser pull that off?&quot; Yep, despite losing all three tosses as well. That series win is criminally underrated. I think it the greatest achievement of my England-watching lifetime, a fraction ahead of 2005.  19th over: England 63-2 (Trott 20, Bopara 13) Here comes Murali. Nurse!He goes straight around the wicket as usual, and Trott top-edges a sweep just short of Herath at deep backward square. I don&apos;t Herath picked it up; if he had, that could have been a chance. Bopara then sweeps two more; maybe England are going to go all Gooch 87 on Murali. &quot;Can everyone stop talking about bars please,&quot; says Jon Park. &quot;The raging sand storm outside, here in Saudi Arabia, means I can&apos;t even get to the staff canteen for lunch. My prediction. England 98 all out. Sri Lanka bowled out in 49th over for 96.&quot;  20th over: England 65-2 (Trott 21, Bopara 14) Mendis has switched ends. &quot;I&apos;d love to have batted against this guy,&quot; says Mike Atherton, who is clearly a sadist. But he&apos;s right; it&apos;s fascinating to watch Mendis&apos;s variations. I&apos;m not sure Trott and Bopara are enjoying them, mind, and there are just two singles from the over. We&apos;ve now had only one boundary in 13 overs. &quot;I&apos;m in Sri Lanka on holiday,&quot; says Jonathan Chads. &quot;The general opinion here is England are going to get whooped. Is say that because when I ask anyone what they think will happen they just laugh in my face and say good luck.&quot;  21st over: England 73-2 (Trott 23, Bopara 20) Bopara tickles Murali past short fine leg for a couple and then opens the face to steer him classily for three. That&apos;s a good over for England, who look a bit more comfortable now. These things, we should stress, are relative. &quot;I&apos;m still desperately drunk after a surprise birthday party last night and have a tiny favour to ask,&quot; says Steve Churnin. &quot;Could you print this and thereby thank Jonny Gill, who came all the way from England to Madrid to surprise me? He&apos;s a cheeky monkey, is all. Also, what&apos;s a good score on this pitch?&quot; Ah, the token bit of cricket chat right at the end of the email. I&apos;m a sucker for it. I would say 220 or above gives England a chance, but really you would want 240 or more.  22nd over: England 77-2 (Trott 25, Bopara 22) A Boring Middle Over! It contained four singles and not even a hint of a scare for England. Who knew Boring Middle Overs could be so satisfying? &quot;I casually threw a left behind piece of brocolli into a pan of water, but it hit the rim and disappeared behind the cooker,&quot; says Ian Copestake. &quot;Being the sentimental sort I went to retrieve it but could not see it on the floor. I then looked up and to my shock saw the sprig somehow clinging on to the edge of the cooker just like Bruce Willis would in Die Hard having been supposedly chucked off a building by one of Alan Rickman&apos;s foreign henchmen. That brocolli is England, my friends. So have faith, because it is Die Hard brocolli.&quot;  23rd over: England 82-2 (Trott 25, Bopara 26) England will probably attempt to adopt the same tactics as New Zealand yesterday \u2013 stay in the game for as long as possible and hope that the pressure tells at the death. Trott plays a dodgy reverse sweep at Muralitharan \u2013 you&apos;re no Paul Nixon, son \u2013 and the ball loops towards the slip area and just in front of the diving Sangakkara. Generally speaking, however, England are milking Murali very well: his figures are 3-0-15-0. &quot;The English dressing room is laughing,&quot; says JP King. &quot;They&apos;ve clearly lost it.&quot;  24th over: England 86-2 (Trott 28, Bopara 27) There has been a bit of iffy running, with some more in that Mendis over. Trott then premeditates a lap for two. This is okay, you know. The hard bit is still to come, and a huge amount depends on Eoin Morgan, but these two have done well under extreme pressure. &quot;Looking through the scorecards from that 2001 series, it&apos;s striking how well Robert Croft did - with the bat as well as the ball,&quot; says Toby Joy. &quot;I&apos;d never really rated him but now have newfound respect; was this his finest series?&quot; Probably. He was exceptional in New Zealand in 1996-97, but Sri Lanka was a much tougher series.  25th over: England 89-2 (Trott 30, Bopara 28) Three singles from Murali&apos;s fourth over. These two had a very similar partnership against South Africa, although that one was for the fourth wicket. England probably need 60 more than they got in the game, yet they are still doing a very good job. &quot;I&apos;m Steve Churnin&apos;s younger and more attractive brother,&quot; says Joe Churnin. &quot;I kind of helped organise the party last night so can you thank me? (I did very little except get him drunk before the actual party started.) Also, cricket chat.&quot;  26th over: England 91-2 (Trott 31, Bopara 29) This is an interesting move, with Lasith Malinga replacing Ajantha Mendis (5-0-17-0). Kumar Sangakkara doesn&apos;t let games drift, and he clearly wants a wicket. He is such an impressive man, Sangakkara. In fact, off the top of my head I can&apos;t think of a more impressive example of 21st century masculinity in the entire known universe. Malinga gets a hint of reverse inswing, rather worryingly for England, and there are two singles from the over. &quot;This is all jolly exciting, isn&apos;t it?&quot; says Paddy McQueen, who is obviously a sadist. &quot;I&apos;m sat at my desk with a rather large pile of philosophy essays to mark. They&apos;re examining either the nature of religious experience, or the problem of evil and human suffering. Both topics seem pretty apt for marking whilst following English cricket.&quot; It&apos;s the most moreish misery around, English cricket.  WICKET! England 95-3 (Bopara LBW b Muralitharan 31) This is such an important breakthrough for Sri Lanka. Bopara misses a sweep at a very full delivery from Muralitharan that pitches on middle and traps him in front. Bopara goes for the review, as much out of desperation as anything, but that was absolutely plumb.  27th over: England 95-3 (Trott 32, Morgan 0) Morgan v Murali. This is the game, right here. It&apos;s hard to see England winning if Morgan fails. &quot;Would love to hear your take on this,&quot; says Steve Betteley. &quot;I was reading a list of the top 10 finishes in cricket history and it had eight Test matches and only two ODIs on it. No Twenty20 matches at all. Now given that Twenty20s, by their very nature, throw up more tight finishes than ODIs and then again Tests, it&apos;s clear that when Tests have dramatic endings, they are more memorable even when they don&apos;t decide a series (No1 on this admittedly Anglocentric list was Edgbaston 05 which, whilst crucial, was just the second Test). Is it a simple question of absence making the heart grow fonder, or is there something in the ebb and flow of four or five days of battle that makes a close ending so much more dramatic than in the shorter versions of the game?&quot; Definitely the latter. It&apos;s just a basic issue of gravitas, right? That was the miracle of the 1999 World Cup semi-final: that it had the epic feel of a great Test match. Out of interest, what was the other ODI in the top 10?  28th over: England 101-3 (Trott 36, Morgan 1) This was tense enough already, and now we have to worry about the little Irish genius as well! Morgan sometimes struggles against pace early on, so it&apos;s good for Sri Lanka that Malinga is on. Morgan digs out a yorker and then pushes a single to leg to get off the mark. Then Trott gloves an attempted hook over the slips for two. That was a superb, slippery bouncer from Malinga. &quot;Re Atherton/Mendis, and Robin Smith/Ian Bishop referred to the other day, you keep confusing sadism with masochism,&quot; says Richard Mansell. &quot;You should be careful with that; you could get into all kinds of difficulty in your personal life.&quot; I suppose there are worse things to confuse, like toothpaste and bleach, but thanks: I shall do 100 lines to drill it into my brain.  29th over: England 104-3 (Trott 37, Morgan 3) Morgan premeditates a lap at his first delivery from Murali, popping it away for the first of three singles in that over. England have hit only four boundaries all innings, the last in the 12th over, but they are still in a reasonable position. Trott survives a biggish LBW appeal from the final delivery. Murali liked it a lot but, although it was very full, it almost certainly pitched outside leg stump and Sangakkara chose not to review. He only has one left, remember. &quot;Your reader should be made aware that Robert Croft is responsible for everything good that has happened in English Test cricket this millennium,&quot; says Nath Jones, whose name may or may give away his nationality. &quot; In 1998 his 37* off 125 balls in the Third Test saved the series against South Africa, then England won the next two to win their first five-match series in twelve years, which was the beginning of everything good. Ashes 2005? Croft. Ashes 2010/11? Croft.&quot; Let&apos;s not worry about that pesky summer of 1999. Mind you, if England had picked Croft.....  30th over: England 112-3 (Trott 37, Morgan 11) Morgan gets only the fifth boundary of the innings, and the first since 1981, with a superb, lazy chip over extra cover off the bowling off Mallinga. He will change the tempo of the innings. Please let him succeed. I mean it, please. Please. I think I should probably cry with joy were he to make a matchwinning century today. He ends a good over for England, eight from it, by clouting a pull in the air for two. Morgan hits so many shots in the air; it&apos;s really not healthy for us stalkers disciples. &quot;The other ODI on the list,&quot; says Steve Betteley, &quot;was SA chasing down 434 to beat the Aussies which I thought was a good call.&quot; Hmm, I suppose. I can&apos;t really take that game seriously, certainly not in comparison to the 1999 semi-final.  31st over: England 125-3 (Trott 46, Morgan 15) Trott gets his first boundary from his 65th delivery, crashing Murali through the covers for four. Trott then works two to leg \u2013\u00a0and that means he is now the highest scorer in the tournament. That&apos;s incredible. What a character. Morgan slices the last ball to third man for four to make it 13 from the over. England are playing Murali so well (7-0-38-0) that you have to wonder if there&apos;s a catch. Is he toying with us? Is he now going to take seven for none and laugh in our face? &quot;Isn&apos;t a masochist someone who likes an ice-cold bath every morning so has a nice warm one instead,&quot; sniffs Lord Selvey.  32nd over: England 129-3 (Trott 48, Morgan 17) Eoin Morgan is dropped! What a let off for England. He sliced Mendis high over point, and Samaraweera ran in from the boundary to take what should have been a routine catch. But he made a shocking mess of it, and Morgan survives. Bloody hell. Of all the England batsmen, Morgan is not the one to whom you should give a second life. &quot;Ian Copestake&apos;s inspiring story was so spoiled by his not knowing how to spell &apos;broccoli&apos;,&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;Don&apos;t you just hate it when that happens? Maybe if you began spelling England players&apos; names wrongly we could achieve a win through sympathetic magic?&quot;  33rd over: England 137-3 (Trott 52, Morgan 21) This pitch has hardly turned at all; it is just very, very slow. Morgan continues to hit the ball in the air, and increase our chances of a collective coronary. He drives the new bowler Dilshan over extra cover for two. He now has 21 from 20 balls and has changed the tempo of the innings. Trott has slipped a gear too and he reverse sweeps Dilshan for three to bring up another excellent half-century, his fifth of the tournament. He&apos;s a phenomenon. &quot;If/when Sri Lanka win this, the four captains left in the tournament will be Vettori, Sangakarra, Dhoni and Afridi,&quot; notes George Wright. &quot;Has there ever been a more impressive, brilliant, downright gorgeous quartet of semi-final captains?&quot;  34th over: England 138-3 (Trott 53, Morgan 21) Morgan survives a huge shout for LBW from Mendis, and this might be worth a review. It was certainly hitting but did it pitch on? With one review remaining, Sangakkara decides not to risk it \u2013 and replays show that he was right. It pitched a fraction outside leg stump. Mendis is troubling Morgan with his variations, and there&apos;s just one run from a superb over. This is fascinating stuff. &quot;It&apos;s an old joke, but that&apos;s never been a barrier to publication on the OBO,&quot; says Josh Robinson. &quot;A sadist and a masochist meet. &apos;Hurt me,&apos; pleads the masochist. The sadist replies &apos;no&apos;.&quot;  35th over: England 146-3 (Trott 55, Morgan 26) Dilshan tries to pick a fight with Morgan, who completely ignores him and then slices an attempted cut to third man for four to complete a good over for England. It also brings up an excellent fifty partnership from only 48 balls. In the brutal heat of Colombo, England&apos;s ice men are playing splendidly. &quot;When the openers perished quickly and Bopara/Trott were in an awful pickle early on, I was quite calm and, dare I say, it jovial,&quot; says Kristian Petterson. &quot;Now, we&apos;ve had a couple of good overs, I&apos;m tense and irritable. Curse this Pavlovian response to Hope.&quot; It&apos;s not the despair...  36th over: England 152-3 (Trott 59, Morgan 28) Trott works the new bowler Herath through midwicket for two to bring up the 150. Six from the over, and Hope is on Twitter, inviting everyone round for the second innings. I hate Hope. &quot;I&apos;ll be satisfying my Guardianista tendencies today by following the OBO from the cuts protest in London,&quot; says Guy Hornsby. &quot;The juxtaposition of the gloom of the economy and the rollercoaster of emotion keeping up with England may be too much for my frail soul. Especially if Morgan&apos;s out.&quot; The cuts protest? People are protesting against OBO typos?  37th over: England 155-3 (Trott 60, Morgan 30) Lasith Malinga is back, and he is such a threat in these late overs. He has a huge shout for LBW turned down when Morgan misses a whip to leg, but again I reckon that pitched outside leg stump and Sangakkara does not risk the final review. In fact, replays show that Morgan would have been out! It pitched just on leg stump \u2013 as Nasser Hussain says on Sky, Malinga&apos;s roundarm action is deceptive in terms of where we think the ball pitches \u2013 and would have gone on to hit. So that&apos;s two lives for Morgan, and three singles from the over. &quot;Is it time,&quot; says Jerry Dawson, &quot;to start worrying about the Powerplay collapse yet?&quot; Oh crikey. They have to leave it to the 46th over, surely?  38th over: England 160-3 (Trott 62, Morgan 34) Five singles from Herath&apos;s over. England have 72 balls remaining, and if they score a run a ball they will reach a very acceptable 231. &quot;I don&apos;t feel well,&quot; says Andrew Hurley. &quot;Morgan is probably my favourite sportsman. Everytime he is on strike my heart stops. I eschewed a perfectly nice day with friends to watch this torture. I compounded it by betting on England to win this, and the tournament. Which of a sadist or masochist am I, or just a plain fool?&quot; The three are not mutually exclusive.  39th over: England 165-3 (Trott 64, Morgan 36) Murali returns to the attack, and Morgan is dropped twice! He&apos;s now had four lives. This is amazing. First he drove one high over extra cover, and Mathews on the fence made a hideous mess of a routine running catch; then he sliced a drive to point, where Jayawardene dropped a fairly difficult chance as the ball died on him. Murali is absolutely furious, punching the air in frustration. I&apos;ve never seen him like that before. &quot;I am not sure if writing out a 100 lines (28th over) is sufficient punishment,&quot; says Richard Mansell. &quot;You&apos;ve been a very naughty boy, haven&apos;t you? (Bleeding heck, I creeped out even myself with that one!)&quot; Oh great, it&apos;s the S&amp;M OBO.  40th over: England 173-3 (Trott 66, Morgan 42) Morgan tries to reverse sweep Herath and gets the merest touch to send the ball past Sangakkara&apos;s right hand and away for four. Eight from the over. &quot;My daughter was born in London 10 years ago,&quot; says Ahmer. &quot;As we moved back to Pakistan 5 years ago exactly half of her life has been spent in England and half in Pakistan. She has been cheering for England in England matches and Pakistan in Pakistan matches. When we ask her which team she would support if Pakistan and England play she never replies. Do you think it is likely that she would have to go through the Tibet test before this tournament is over?&quot; Actually, I&apos;d say there&apos;s more chance of her having to go through the Tibet test \u2013 whatever that is \u2013 than the Tebbit test. Surely England can&apos;t get to the final?  41st over: England 177-3 (Trott 68, Morgan 44) Four from Mendis&apos;s over. &quot;An appeal to all OBOers to contribute to Link Ethiopia, a quality small charity making a massive difference in Ethiopia, to motivate my attempt to run London Marathon,&quot; says Jon Devaney. &quot;What&apos;s the cricket link? Two things. 1/ My athletic prowess is more Jimmy Ormond than Jimmy Anderson. 2/ I set up the only known cricket match to take place in Ethiopia back in 1997. The bat was a straight plank of wood (somewhat lacking a middle), the ball a mis-shapen chewed up tennis ball causing vicious deviation off the &apos;seam&apos; and the players had less patience than KP facing a part-time left-arm spinner. Suffice to say it was declared NR after a couple of overs as it descended into a game of footie on the outfield. You can donate here.&quot;  42nd over: England 182-3 (Trott 69, Morgan 48) Trott survives an LBW appeal when he misses a reverse sweep at Herath. I think it was going over the top, and it might have pitched outside leg. Five from the over. &quot;Even when England bat like it&apos;s 1986 \u2013 cautiously; saving wickets for the last eight overs of slog \u2013 they&apos;re still terrifying,&quot; says Andrew Mullinder. &quot;There&apos;s a constant frisson in the air when they play. They could be directed by early Ridley Scott. If they can reduce even the happiest guy in cricket reduced to Punteresque impotent rage, what chance do we have?&quot;  WICKET! England 186-4 (Morgan c Mathews b Malinga 50) Get behind the sofa: England have taken the batting Powerplay. You know what that means. Just after reaching his fifty, breaking his bat in the process, Morgan slices Malinga high to Mathews at point. In a novel development he decides to catch the ball, and Morgan has gone for an unusual but vital 55-ball 50.  43rd over: England 186-4 (Trott 71, Swann 0) I like this move. England have promoted Graeme Swann, specifically because we are in the Powerplay and he can hit over the top. &quot;Murali was waving both fists at once after that dropped catch, a textbook cartoon funk, like teacher when the Bash Street Kids have really been pushing their luck,&quot; says Scott Murray. &quot;That&apos;s the hottest anybody&apos;s been in this World Cup so far, apart from when you lost it with Clinton Rowling yesterday.&quot; It was hilarious. For about five seconds he was so annoyed that I think he was actually growling.  WICKET! England 186-5 (Swann LBW b Mendis 0) Well that was fun. Graeme Swann goes for a golden duck, plumb LBW to Mendis when he completely misses a reverse slog sweep. Told you it was a good move. At least he didn&apos;t waste any time, though.  44th over: England 190-5 (Trott 73, Prior 2) Just four singles from Mendis&apos;s over, and the wicket. Can we put batting Powerplays in Room 101, please? Nice one.  45th over: England 193-5 (Trott 74, Prior 3) A majestic over of death bowling from Malinga, full of yorkers and slower balls, yields just three, and one of those was an off-side wide. England are losing their way a touch. These next five overs are toenail-gnawingly important. &quot;If a side wants to bowl England out, they should ask the ICC if they can donate their bowling Powerplays to the batting side,&quot; says Andrew Losowsky. &quot;We&apos;d be all out for 22 after 15 overs of comedy bat-wafting. Why don&apos;t we just pretend the Powerplays don&apos;t exist? We have higher a run rate in Tests.&quot;  46th over: England 197-5 (Trott 76, Prior 5) Prior drags Mendis on the bounce to deep midwicket and then Trott survives an LBW appeal after being hit on the forearm when he misses a reverse sweep. He was outside the line. Just four singles from the over. Mendis has been almost unhittable at times, and his boundaryless stint ends with outstanding figures of 10-0-32-1. &quot;Aggers on 5 Live is befuddled by the decision to send &apos;dead fish&apos; Swann out early,&quot; says Mark Hooper. &quot;Seemed a pretty good idea on paper I thought?&quot; I think it was an excellent idea. He&apos;s our most unfettered batsman, he&apos;s unorthodox, he hits over the top. The fact he failed doesn&apos;t invalidate the original idea; far from it.  47th over: England 205-5 (Trott 81, Prior 7) Trott makes room to ping Malinga&apos;s first ball over point for three and bring up the 200; later in the over, Sangakkara saves five wides with a beautiful save diving to his left to stop a bouncer from Malinga. That&apos;s a better over for England \u2013\u00a0no boundaries, but eight runs. If England can get 240 their lunchtime Gatorade will rarely have tasted so good, but a competitive and slightly under par 220 might have to do. &quot;As Clinton Rowling might have said, stop commenting on the cricket and distract us with tales of drunken masochism please,&quot; says Ian Copestake. After such a long winter, I&apos;m starting to forget where one ends and the other begins.  48th over: England 211-5 (Trott 86, Prior 8) Herath replaces Mendis and starts with three dot balls to an unsurprisingly exhausted Trott. When he gets off strike, Prior misses out on a rank long hop, pulling it on the bounce to deep midwicket. That should have gone for four \u2013 but England do get a boundary from the last ball, with Trott sweeping emphatically through midwicket. Six from the over. &quot;The essays remain unmarked \u2013 this cricket business is rather gripping,&quot; says Paddy McQueen. &quot;As the English wickets start to tumble in the ol&apos; Powerplay, is now the time to mention that you were in my dreams last night? Yup, that&apos;s right. I think I&apos;ve hit a new low. You were sitting in a chair, talking to a camera crew about cricket. All I remember is thinking &apos;So that&apos;s what he sounds like&apos;. I may also have been yearning for the dapper attractions of Andy Bull.&quot; Security!  WICKET! England 212-6 (Trott c Jayawardene b Muralitharan 86) Trott&apos;s excellent innings ends when he swings Murali to deep backward square leg. England have nine balls remaining.  49th over: England 222-6 (Prior 16, Wright 0) All of a sudden Murali is struggling with his hamstring injury. He hobbles in for his last few deliveries \u2013 and Prior takes advantage, slamming a four over midwicket to add to a wide that goes down the leg side for two. Murali is leaving the field and must be a doubt for Tuesday&apos;s semi-final when Sri Lanka get there. That&apos;s right, Dame Fortune, when. &quot;Is now a good time to spread some positive karma and get people behind my marathon bid?&quot; wonders Duncan Crowe.  50th over: England 229-6 (Prior 22, Wright 1) The last over of the innings from Malinga goes for seven. Wright misses an almighty yahoo that almost knocks him off his feet. &quot;It helps if you look at it,&quot; deadpans Beefy in the commentary box. I wish that Trevor Hohns dismissal was on YouTube. Prior then plays a fine shot, steering a slower bouncer to third man for four. He played a decent little cameo of 22 from 19 balls, and England have set a competitive target. Sri Lanka need 230 to win. They are slight favourites, but England are right in this, and you&apos;ll be needing those valium at some stage this afternoon. See you in half an hour.  INNINGS BREAK  1st over: Sri Lanka 2-0 (target 230; Tharanga 0, Dilshan 0) Tim Bresnan is going to open the bowling, and his first ball swings encouragingly back into Tharanga. That&apos;s a good sign for England. As David Brent didn&apos;t quite say, I think there&apos;s some been shape out there! Tharanga throws the bat at the second ball. Fresh air goes skimming through point for four, and the ball goes through to Matt Prior. A good first over yields only two leg byes. &quot;Am I the only one really nervous about Tremlett on this pudding pitch?&quot; says Andrew Losowsky. &quot;I have visions of him bowling three overs for 35, and Bopara and Trott between them having to bowl the other seven. Assuming it&apos;s not all over by the 38th.&quot; I get very nervous watching Tremlett in one-day cricket. The psychological balance is all wrong. In Tests he is attacking the batsmen; in ODIs the batsmen are attacking him. I don&apos;t think that suits such a gentle bloke.  2nd over: Sri Lanka 6-0 (target 230; Tharanga 3, Dilshan 1) Graeme Swann will share the new ball, as he did in the previous game against the West Indies. It&apos;s a statement of the offensively obvious, but Swann is so important tonight and he beats Tharanga with a jaffa that spits past the edge. Even Murali did not turn it that much. Tharanga responds with a lovely cover drive for three. &quot;Rob, I&apos;m losing it,&quot; states Ian Copestake. &quot;I hate Capello, I hate Terry, I hate the thought of there being another match involving England than this one today. Could coverage be extended in a loop until 12 midnight?&quot; Maybe the OBO will get so intense towards the end that you literally won&apos;t be able to shut the browser down. And if you try to walk away the computer will just follow you.  3rd over: Sri Lanka 13-0 (target 230; Tharanga 10, Dilshan 1) Bresnan gives Tharanga a touch of width and is punished with a superb back cut for four. Seven from the over. &quot;Unable to watch cricket on internet as being forced to take my sister on a cultural tour of Naples,&quot; says Colum Fordham. &quot;No supply of valium or brandy to hand either. Will follow OBO secretly as I go round the impressive grounds of Villa Roseberry, summer residence of President Napolitano.&quot;  4th over: Sri Lanka 21-0 (target 230; Tharanga 17, Dilshan 2) That&apos;s a stunning stroke from Tharanga, who charges Swann and drives him right back over his head for six. Shot! Swann is getting a lot of turn, though, and England will be encouraged by that.  5th over: Sri Lanka 22-0 (target 230; Tharanga 17, Dilshan 3) Dilshan mis-pulls a heavy bouncer from Bresnan just over midwicket, the start of a very accurate over that yields just a single. &quot;Here in Germany, Sky Sports - who have their priorities sorted - are showing curling,&quot; says Tim Smith. &quot;No, sorry, International Ladies&apos; Curling. Very soothing for shredded nerves, hopefully less addictive than valium...&quot;  6th over: Sri Lanka 30-0 (target 230; Tharanga 17, Dilshan 10) Dilshan drills Swann through the covers for four and then squirts a square drive for three more, aided by some clumsy fielding from Luke Wright at point. &quot;How do our boys look out there,&quot; says Charlotte Baily, eschewing the increasingly marginalised question mark. &quot;Do they look spirited and up for the fight?&quot; If you mean, do they have the battle fever on, then yep, very much so. But Sri Lanka have started well\u00a0\u2013 Swann&apos;s three overs have gone for 20 \u2013 and England need a wicket or ten.  7th over: Sri Lanka 31-0 (target 230; Tharanga 17, Dilshan 11) Chris Tremlett comes into the attack and gives Dilshan all sorts of agita. The first ball beat Dilshan&apos;s filthy mow, the second brought a biggish LBW appeal (it was going down leg) and the third jagged back a mile to cut Dilshan in half and miss the leg bail by a whisker. England appealed for caught behind down the leg side, but Simon Taufel turned them down and they did not review the decision. One from a superb first over.  8th over: Sri Lanka 40-0 (target 230; Tharanga 17, Dilshan 16) Ravi Bopara replaces Graeme Swann. That&apos;s a bit of a risk in a Powerplay, and his opening over goes for nine. The first ball is driven for four, the second misses the off stump and goes through Matt Prior&apos;s legs for four byes, and the fourth cannons off the inside edge and back onto the pad. Dilshan is swinging like a drunk in the OBO local, the Slug &amp; Statsguru, after a zesty dispute over the merits of Simon Brown as a Test player.  9th over: Sri Lanka 50-0 (target 230; Tharanga 17, Dilshan 26) That&apos;s a better stroke from Dilshan, who flogs a fuller delivery from Tremlett through extra cover for four. He gets four more in the same region later in the over to bring up the fifty partnership. England are in trouble. They have got to get Dilshan soon. &quot;Am in Waterstones pretending to be interested in my wife&apos;s choice of Mothers&apos; Day present,&quot; says S Dickens. &quot;Do you think a ticket to the final would go down well?&quot;  10th over: Sri Lanka 57-0 (target 230; Tharanga 24, Dilshan 26) Tharanga lifts a leg-stump half volley from Bopara sweetly over midwicket for a one-bounce four but almost falls to the next delivery, popping a slower ball back on the bounce to Bopara. Three more through midwicket complete an expensive over. &quot;Am being dragged round Primark by my darling girlfriend,&quot; says Samuel Cutting. &quot;Nerves fraying on many different levels. Am yet to find the narcotics section. Huddled in a corner with OBO on phone glancing desperately at fellow aggrieved male shoppers.&quot;  11th over: Sri Lanka 58-0 (target 230; Tharanga 25, Dilshan 26) James Tredwell will replace Chris Tremlett, who bowled one good over and one bad one. England have not taken the bowling Powerplay for the time being, and Tredwell&apos;s first over is an accurate affair that costs just a single. &quot;Over in Canada we just had a general election called, and I find myself running as a candidate!&quot; says Mark Ireland. &quot;I&apos;m thinking that a) I must be the first OBO follower to run for parliament and b) not even election night will be as nerve shredding as this. Oh, since you ask, Port Moody-Westwood-Port Coquitlam is my constituency, and yes the support of other OBOers in the area is welcome!&quot;  12th over: Sri Lanka 61-0 (target 230; Tharanga 27, Dilshan 27) Now Luke Wright is going to bowl, so England have used six bowlers inside the first 12 overs. Another pretty decent over costs only two. England have a degree of control; now they need a wicket.  13th over: Sri Lanka 68-0 (target 230; Tharanga 33, Dilshan 28) Dilshan rocks back to cut a big-spinning delivery from Tredwell and slices it just wide of the diving Strauss at slip. Tharanga, who has bowled beautifully, square drives the next ball for four \u2013 and then he is extremely lucky to survive. He chipped Tredwell high in the air towards long off, but Tremlett was perhaps a little slow to react and the ball bounced just in front of him.  14th over: Sri Lanka 74-0 (target 230; Tharanga 35, Dilshan 30) Dilshan misses an attempted cut off Wright and then flogs him in the air but wide of the man at cover. &quot;Thought you might like this from Gilly,&quot; says Malavika Jayaram. &quot;&apos;The English cricket team have been snatching victory not from the jaws of defeat, but rather from mid-oesophagus!&apos;&quot;  15th over: Sri Lanka 77-0 (target 230; Tharanga 37, Dilshan 31) Tremlett beats Tharanga with a brutal delivery that keeps low and turns square. Where did that come from? Three singles from the over. &quot;Thankfully, Pavlov&apos;s done one,&quot; says Kristian Petterson. &quot;Unfortunately, the dregs of my Hope are leaving a nasty aftertaste of self-loathing and general resentment towards all humanity. Fortunately, I&apos;m well acquainted with the flavour.&quot;  16th over: Sri Lanka 79-0 (target 230; Tharanga 37, Dilshan 32) Wright is bowling very straight, trying to cramp the batsmen on around middle and leg, and thus far it has worked reasonably well. Two from the over, but \u2013 stop me if you think etc \u2013 England desperately need a wicket. &quot;Mark Ireland comes nowhere near my record,&quot; says Tim Hedges. &quot;Within the space of a couple of years I failed to be elected to the Parliament at Westminster, the European Parliament and The General Synod of the Church of England.&quot; Which computer game is this?  17th over: Sri Lanka 87-0 (target 230; Tharanga 38, Dilshan 39) Dilshan charges Tredwell and drives mightily over wide mid off for six. That&apos;s an awesome stroke, and I&apos;m afraid England are going out of the World Cup. &quot;I am blaming this chill running down my spine on the unseasonably cool weather in Bangkok rather than the cricket score,&quot; says Jeremy Swire. &quot;Finally I can dig out the scarf the mother dearest sent over!&quot;  18th over: Sri Lanka 94-0 (target 230; Tharanga 39, Dilshan 44) Swann is back, and in the commentary box Bumble has started talking about jockstraps. Dilshan charges Swann and edges a drive through the vacant slip area for four. It&apos;s another lucky escape for him, but the tempo of his innings \u2013 44 from 46 balls \u2013 has taken the game away from England. &quot;Re: Tim Hedges&apos; achievement (16th over), me too,&quot; says Mike Selvey.  19th over: Sri Lanka 101-0 (target 230; Tharanga 44, Dilshan 45) Tim Bresnan comes on after the drinks break, and Tharanga steers him cleverly wide of Strauss at slip and away for four. If Dilshan has been very lucky, then Tharanga has played supremely. &quot;This just isn&apos;t right,&quot; says Phil Sawyer. &quot;We shouldn&apos;t be going out like this, with a dull subdued whimper, after the campaign we&apos;ve had. We should be bowling wides that make Harmison&apos;s in the 06 Ashes look like the epitome of line and length. We should have three fielders run into each other trying to take the same catch. Matt Prior should lose it in the 37th over and run around the pitch naked after declaring his undying love for Billy Doctrove. Anything but this.&quot;  20th over: Sri Lanka 108-0 (target 230; Tharanga 44, Dilshan 48) A gorgeous delivery from Swann gates Dilshan, bounce just over off stump and completely beats Prior on its way for four byes. Dilshan then laps one onto the leg of Ian Bell, who anticipated the stroke ran round from short leg. &quot;Come now, you&apos;ve clearly stated (granted, not without cause) on at least two previous occasions that England are going out of the World Cup,&quot; says Tom Hopkins. &quot;Admittedly, it was on the third occasion that the boy actually had seen a wolf, but I&apos;m still not convinced.&quot;  21st over: Sri Lanka 115-0 (target 230; Tharanga 49, Dilshan 50) Dilshan reaches his half-century with a push on the off side. It&apos;s been a manic and matchwinning effort, from only 57 balls. The runs continue to flow, with Tharanga spanking Bresnan back over his head for four. &quot;England,&quot; says Ian Copestake, &quot;are brocolli.&quot;  22nd over: Sri Lanka 120-0 (target 230; Tharanga 51, Dilshan 53) Now Tharanga reaches his half-century, a superb effort from 70 balls, and then Bresnan slog sweeps Swann on the bounce towards deep midwicket, where Bresnan makes a brilliant diving stop.  23rd over: Sri Lanka 125-0 (target 230; Tharanga 53, Dilshan 56) Oh well, it was fun while it lasted. Anyone for trololo?  24th over: Sri Lanka 127-0 (target 230; Tharanga 53, Dilshan 57) Chris Tremlett comes back into the attack and beats Tharanga with an excellent lifter. England haven&apos;t bowled badly tonight, far from it. Sri Lanka are simply a better 50-over team, particularly in their own conditions, and they are showing that. &quot;They should have disbanded the team after the Ashes,&quot; says Jonah Gadsby, &quot;because it never was and never will be as good.&quot;  25th over: Sri Lanka 132-0 (target 230; Tharanga 58, Dilshan 57) There&apos;s a cracking contest going on \u2013 but it&apos;s in the commentary box between Ian Botham and Nasser Hussain. Beefy thinks England did not hit down the ground enough and used far too reverse sweeps; Nasser says that&apos;s tosh and that you can&apos;t hit down the ground if you don&apos;t know which way it&apos;s spinning. &quot;Bad as this is,&quot; says Chris Wright, &quot;there&apos;s something beautiful about a South Asian world cup with three South Asian semi-finalists and only New Zealand for company.&quot; Too right. The final, assuming Sri Lanka get there, will be an epic.  26th over: Sri Lanka 134-0 (target 230; Tharanga 59, Dilshan 58) Tremlett puts down a return catch. It was a hot one, after Tharanga hammered the ball back down the ground, and it just didn&apos;t stick in his right hand. Tremlett is bowling with admirable pride in the face of imminent defeat; that was a superb over that cost just two. &quot;If England do go out of the world cup, do you have to go home too?&quot; says Angus Doulton. &quot;Will they miss you in Guardian Towers? Will Mrs Smyth be pleased to see you?&quot;  27th over: Sri Lanka 135-0 (target 230; Tharanga 59, Dilshan 58) The scoring rate has dropped a bit, with only 10 from the last four overs. Could it be the start of a dramatic twist? Could it? Could it really? Clue: no. &quot;I am back from my Saturday shopping and I hope the boring part of the match is all done with,&quot; says Anand. &quot;Am ready to embrace the spate of wickets that will fall now and make the next 20 overs the most important and watchable part of the game.&quot; Don&apos;t forget the Super Over.  28th over: Sri Lanka 140-0 (target 230; Tharanga 62, Dilshan 60) Again Tharanga hammers one straight back at Tremlett, and again he can&apos;t hang on, this time as he reached to his left. He just got a fingertip on it. &quot;Am I the only one now hoping for a sudden Noah-esque downpour to put us out of our misery?&quot; says Simon Ball. &quot;At least we could then tell ourselves we&apos;d have staged another comeback in the dying overs, and Messrs Duckworth &amp; Lewis don&apos;t know jack about cricket? Anything rather than endure this.&quot; Or, as above but appeal for a return to the 1992 rain rules on the grounds that, like, a contest is good for the tournament and stuff.  29th over: Sri Lanka 146-0 (target 230; Tharanga 62, Dilshan 65) Dilshan scorches Bopara over mid off for four, his first boundary for 11 overs. &quot;England will come home with no harshness waiting for them,&quot; says Clare Davies. &quot;They have entertained and been magnificent in many ways.&quot; Preach on, sister.  30th over: Sri Lanka 151-0 (target 230; Tharanga 64, Dilshan 68) England have taken their bowling Powerplay, and Dilshan slaps a cut off Bresnan for a couple. Then he works a single to bring up the 150 partnership. Fantastic stuff. Sri Lanka look an extremely formidable side. &quot;I&apos;m going out in the selfless hope that my absence = wickets, so that I can later kick myself for missing the best turnaround in history blah blah,&quot; says Malavika Jayaram. &quot;It&apos;s a sacrifice I&apos;m willing to make if it means we win.&quot;  31st over: Sri Lanka 165-0 (target 230; Tharanga 69, Dilshan 77) Dilshan takes consecutive boundaries off the returning Tredwell with a lofted sweep and an inside-out slap over extra cover. Tharanga completes an expensive over with a gorgeous chip over extra cover for four. Two of England&apos;s four ten-wicket defeats in ODIs have occurred in Sri Lanka. It might soon be three out of five.  32nd over: Sri Lanka 172-0 (target 230; Tharanga 75, Dilshan 78) Four more to Tharanga, scorched past backward point off Bresnan. Before this tournament nobody had ever won a World Cup knockout game by 10 wickets; this could be the second instance in four days after Pakistan hammered the West Indies. &quot;Sorry to see it all end this way, but there is good news in that VH1 are showing Best Male Singers of all time here in Turkey, where we are now inside the top 40,&quot; says Wayne Trotman. &quot;Barry Manilow was 40. Who do you fancy as number one?&quot; Milli Vanilla. Next.  33rd over: Sri Lanka 179-0 (target 230; Tharanga 80, Dilshan 80) That&apos;s a glorious shot from Tharanga, a scintillating extra-cover drive for four off Luke Wright. He has played exceptionally well. Dilshan then makes a mess of a Dilscoop, flicking it into the body of Matt Prior. Sri Lanka need just 51 more from 17 overs. &quot;Torn between cheering for England in Wales vs England at Millennium or England vs Sri Lanka here,&quot; says Annie Newton. &quot;Rob, hopefully this means you&apos;ll get to be back with all the baby Smyths running around, with you on point to teach them the right willow grip. The moral in all this seems to be that all England games ought to be held on Indian soil, for guaranteed results.&quot; Yep, all the baby Smyths are a right menace.  34th over: Sri Lanka 186-0 (target 230; Tharanga 85, Dilshan 82) Dilshan misses a pull at a slower delivery from Bresnan and inadvertently throws his bat in the direction of square leg. Then Tharanga lifts Bresnan gracefully down the ground for four. Jeez he has played well. &quot;Clare Davies has it spot on,&quot; says Tom Hopkins. &quot;England have had a gruelling schedule, lost half a team through a variety of unfortunate circumstances and yet have performed admirably (if inconsistently) and are about to lose to a very strong team on their home turf. Back in November, if you&apos;d have offered me a 1-0 win in The Ashes and a first round exit in the World Cup I&apos;d have bitten your hand off. England haven&apos;t failed, they&apos;ve overperformed.&quot; Aye. No man-love has been lost today. They&apos;re a thoroughly admirable bunch, and it&apos;s nice that they can go out of the World Cup without any of the juvenile nonsense we see every time England exit a major football tournament.  35th over: Sri Lanka 196-0 (target 230; Tharanga 86, Dilshan 91) Swann comes back, and his first ball is slog-swept mightily for six by Dilshan. Shot! As Alan Wilkins says on Sky, these two make a beautifully contrasting opening pair: one is left-handed, serene and elegant; the other is right-handed, manic and brutal. &quot;Oh Rob,&quot; says Bella. &quot;Just checking the OBO whilst in the pub for a hen do. Totally gutted by the prospect of a 10-wicket hammering. How can I sustain fun for the rest of the night with a hammering in sight. Your advice please.&quot; Given that you already are in the pub, I guess you could forget this hammering by, well, getting hammered.  36th over: Sri Lanka 202-0 (target 230; Tharanga 90, Dilshan 93) Dilshan hooks Tremlett for a single to bring up Sri Lanka&apos;s second 200 partnership of the tournament. This is a helluva statement of intent going into the semi-finals. You would probably make them favourites for the tournament now, partly because whoever wins the other semi-final between India and Pakistan is going to expend an incredible amount of energy in doing so. And Sri Lanka, assuming they beat New Zealand, will have an extra day&apos;s rest ahead of the final. Murali&apos;s injury is a big worry, mind. &quot;Something&apos;s gone wrong when my sadness at England&apos;s exit is almost matched by relief on their behalf that they can finally go home,&quot; says Niall Harden. &quot;And by something I mean everything.&quot; Think of the children, though! That quote from Paul Collingwood&apos;s daughters was really sweet. And Graeme Swann won&apos;t have to watch his newborn on Skype any more.  37th over: Sri Lanka 211-0 (target 230; Tharanga 91, Dilshan 101) Dilshan thrashes Swann past point for four to bring up his second hundred of the tournament, from 107 balls and with nine fours and two sixes. He sinks to his knees for a moment of reflection, while all around him the crowd cheer wildly. He rode his luck at first but he has played some sensational shots. &quot;It seems to me that England are leaving their astonishing comeback &apos;til later in every game of this tournament,&quot; says Oliver Gaywood. &quot;At this rate we&apos;ll win the final by getting all ten wickets with the opposition needing just two to win.&quot;  38th over: Sri Lanka 220-0 (target 230; Tharanga 96, Dilshan 103) Sri Lanka are finishing this in a hurry, and Tharanga cleaves Tremlett over point for his 11th four. &quot;I commend all this looking on the bright side that&apos;s going on,&quot; weeps Andrew Losowsky. &quot;May I add to our reasons to be cheerful with the thought that Adil Rashid now has several thousand more air miles than he had yesterday, probably watched some good in-flight movies as well, and will be arriving just in time to return to the airport for more.&quot;  39th over: Sri Lanka 227-0 (target 230; Tharanga 98, Dilshan 108) Dilshan blasts Swann through the covers for four. Three needed to win, and Tharanga needs two for his hundred. I wonder what Alex Tudor is doing right now. There are two balls remaining in the over and, when Dilshan blocks both, it prompts the loudest cheer of the day. That was a lovely moment.  39.3 overs: Sri Lanka 231-0 (Tharanga 102, Dilshan 108). SRI LANKA WIN BY 10 WICKETS WITH 63 BALLS REMAINING A perfect way to end a perfect day for Sri Lanka. Tharanga laces Tremlett through the covers for four to reach a wonderful hundred and seal the most emphatic victory imaginable \u2013 even more emphatic than their famous demolition of England at the same stage in 1996. They have played formidably well, and will now meet New Zealand in Colombo on Tuesday.            For England, there should be no regrets or recriminations. There was always a danger that this would be a game too far for them, and so it proved, but they have done us proud all winter \u2013 as cricketers, but also a group of blokes. In a sense, there is relief that it&apos;s over. Now they can finally fly home after five months on tour and, while they might almost have forgotten what their families look like, they will never forget the winter of 2010-11. Nor will we.

Details of the \u00a335m extension plan were announced after an architectural competition to develop what is currently office space on the Exhibition Road side of the V&amp;A. It follows the decision in 2004 to axe Libeskind&apos;s proposal \u2013 an eye-catching extension resembling an uneven stack of cardboard boxes. It divided opinion fiercely and when people hated it, they really hated it. Journalist William Rees-Mogg went so far as to call it a potential &quot;disaster for civilisation&quot;. Now the V&amp;A is expanding underground, with British architect Amanda Levete winning the contest to build its extension. Levete said she had &quot;dreamed of working on a major public and cultural project ever since I started as an architect, and it doesn&apos;t get much better than this&quot;. The V&amp;A is bullish about raising the money in such austere times and has been helped by an anonymous donation of nearly half the needed \u00a335m. It hopes the extension can be completed by 2015. The proposal would see visitors walking into an open public courtyard off a newly landscaped Exhibition Road through the screen erected by Sir Aston Webb in 1909 to hide the boilerhouse yard. The screen would become a colonnade. People will enter what Levete described as &quot;South Kensington&apos;s drawing room&quot; with the ground having a carpet-like pattern. It will be a space that can be hired or curated with art or music or film as well as a place to simply sit on the steps or have a coffee. Visitors will also be able to glimpse the new 1,500 sq metre gallery space for temporary exhibitions that will be created below. Levete was for 20 years co-partner with Jan Kaplicky of Future Systems, the firm behind the Selfridges store in Birmingham and the Lord&apos;s media centre. After Kaplicky&apos;s death two years ago, Levete set up her practice, ALA. The V&amp;A commission is one of a number of projects she is working on. Others include a hotel in Bangkok, a subway station in Naples with artist Anish Kapoor, and a residential tower in Shoreditch, east London. Levete said the V&amp;A work had been &quot;a very interesting and paradoxical project&quot; because it involved making the invisible visible. &quot;We&apos;re creating a vast gallery that is below ground, so how do you create that sense of there being something underground in a way that is subtle?&quot; It is all very different to Libeskind&apos;s plan. Levete said of his Spiral: &quot;It was a great building but for me it was in the wrong place and I think the moment for that iconography has passed \u2013 it is the moment to do something different.&quot; Paul Ruddock, chair of the V&amp;A&apos;s trustees, said the project was essential. &quot;The V&amp;A produces the very best international design exhibitions and the existing exhibition courts, arranged over three separate rooms, are no longer fit for purpose.&quot; The extension is part of the V&amp;A&apos;s second 10-year phase of restoration and redesign, called Future Plan. Also planned is a new fashion gallery scheduled to open in May 2012, furniture galleries for November 2012 and a new textile and fashion centre at Blythe House, Olympia. Outgoing V&amp;A director Sir Mark Jones said the plan was about creating &quot;stunning new spaces&quot; and returning to the ideas and aspirations of the V&amp;A&apos;s founders. &quot;We&apos;ve recovered 3,000 sq metres of back-of-house space for galleries and public areas enabling us to show many more objects from the collections better than ever before.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-03-28T16:29:42Z", "tags": ["V&A", "Architecture", "Exhibitions", "Anish Kapoor", "Art and design", "Museums", "Culture", "London", "UK news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/mar/28/v-and-a-35m-plans", "title": "V&A unveils \u00a335m plans for courtyard and underground gallery", "sentences": ["Others include a hotel in Bangkok, a subway station in Naples with artist Anish Kapoor, and a residential tower in Shoreditch, east London."]}, {"article": "THAILAND  BENJAMIN ZAWACKI - Asia researcher (Thailand and Myanmar), 35 Benjamin Zawacki started his job as Amnesty&apos;s Asia researcher as saffron-robed monks were being shot on the streets of Rangoon in September 2007. Amnesty has been banned from operating in Burma by the ruling military junta since 2003, so Zawacki did what he could from his base in Bangkok \u2013 liaising with his in-country contacts, giving press statements and trying to contain his frustration that he couldn&apos;t do more. &quot;While Thailand has serious freedom of expression issues that can have a chilling effect on its citizens, it is generally more progressive, but Myanmar [Burma] is a human rights basket case,&quot; he says. &quot;Despite any professional distance you try to establish, it&apos;s impossible not to become emotionally charged when you see monks being beaten on the streets, or just months later witness the human devastation of cyclone Nargis, where the authorities displayed indifference to the suffering of their own people.&quot; A Pennsylvania native and law graduate, Zawacki spent years working in Asia and Africa before starting his current job. The role requires him to conduct independent field research and write reports into human rights abuses and concerns within Thailand and Burma. Although his legal and academic background and field experience prepared him for the intellectual rigours of the post, he says his main weakness as an expat researcher is understanding the enormously complex cultural, social and political dynamics of the countries he is operating in. Last year violence erupted on his doorstep when Thai troops battled anti-government &quot;red shirt&quot; protesters on the streets of Bangkok. Despite his years in the job, Zawacki was still shocked by how quickly the demonstrations turned ugly. &quot;The experience of seeing violence in the streets of Bangkok was startling,&quot; he says. &quot;The demonstrations last year paralysed and polarised the entire country. It became a very difficult environment for us to operate in.&quot; With propaganda from both sides creating an information smokescreen, his biggest challenge was trying to determine what was and wasn&apos;t credible information. &quot;Just because there is violence doesn&apos;t mean there are human rights violations taking place,&quot; he says. &quot;At the time we were under enormous pressure from all sides.&quot; Eventually Zawacki concluded that the government was using lethal force unlawfully, pitting Amnesty directly against the authorities. &quot;Unlike many of my colleagues around the world, I&apos;ve never felt my own personal safety is at risk,&quot; he says. &quot;But the pressure to get things right, to make the correct analysis is constant. At the same time I would never dream of doing any other job. I&apos;m doing what I&apos;ve always wanted to do.&quot; AK MEXICO     Alberto Aragon: \u2018Some 22,000 are kidnapped every year\u2019    ALBERTO ARAGON - Executive director, Amnesty International Mexico, 26 &quot;Mexico is a key country for Amnesty International, not just because of its strategic position but because of the widespread abuse of human rights there,&quot; says Alberto Arag\u00f3n, head of the 3,000-strong Amnesty Mexico section, where he has worked for nine years. &quot;It has become even more important since the army adopted a policing role in the war against the drug cartels in 2006.&quot; Arag\u00f3n catalogues every type of abuse, from illegal detention to torture and murder, but says what makes matters worse is that the soldiers are not subject to civil justice, and this has created a climate of impunity. &quot;There can&apos;t be a successful strategy for tackling organised crime without also tackling the judicial system,&quot; says Arag\u00f3n. &quot;But this impunity derives from the current strategy. When the president put the army on the streets he should have introduced measures to make them accountable. The increased levels of human rights abuses are a result of this.&quot; The army&apos;s human rights record is no better in the semi-independent Chiapas region in the south, he continues, where most of the population is indigenous and many are denied the most basic rights, such as access to an interpreter during interrogation. Amnesty is also involved in highlighting the infamous &quot;femicides&quot; in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez where hundreds and possibly thousands of women have been murdered in the past 15 years. &quot;It isn&apos;t just happening in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez,&quot; says Arag\u00f3n. &quot;It is happening in other states in Mexico where the number of women murdered is scandalous. The state&apos;s response has been extremely weak. Here again we face a climate of impunity where the authorities do little to find and prosecute the perpetrators.&quot; Attempted emigration across the border to the United States also raises human rights issues, and is, Arag\u00f3n says, a key issue for Amnesty. &quot;But not just emigration from Mexico to the US,&quot; he says. &quot;There are unimaginable levels of violence committed against immigrants from elsewhere in central and south America in transit across Mexico to the US. Some 22,000 immigrants are kidnapped every year and held to ransom as a large number of them already have relatives in the US. This is an organised industry where as well as cash ransoms sometimes they demand the release of a criminal in return for the life of an immigrant.&quot; Arag\u00f3n admits that rights workers are continually at risk of arbitrary detention or even assassination but says the work of Amnesty is crucial if there is to be any respect for human rights in his country. SB NORTH AFRICA     Samira Bouslama: \u2018People are scared to talk\u2019    SAMIRA BOUSLAMA - Campaigner for Libya, Algeria and Morocco, 45 Samira Bouslama&apos;s eyes were opened to the &quot;dark part&quot; of Tunisia while exploring the slums in her home town of Hammamet. She was a teenager, making a documentary for an amateur film club, and the experience motivated her to make a career fighting for human rights. &quot;Was I taking a risk? I didn&apos;t think about it,&quot; she says. &quot;Living in Tunisia was a permanent struggle for your basic human rights. You had to perform acrobatics just to survive.&quot; As a campaigner for Amnesty, she is currently working on an Algerian case, &quot;a man called Malik Medjnoun who was accused of the murder of a famous singer and arrested\u00a0in 1999. He was tortured, kept in detention without access to his family and lawyer, and he has never been tried.&quot; She met Medjnoun&apos;s family on a recent trip to Algeria. &quot;It&apos;s amazing when they thank Amnesty. They told me, &apos;The letters are keeping our family hoping, and keeping our brother in jail hoping.&apos;&quot; Bouslama is also involved with Libya but the Gaddafi regime has prohibited Amnesty from visiting the country. &quot;People are scared to talk by phone and send pictures, but we need evidence, otherwise we won&apos;t be believed. If Amnesty is still respected, it is because of its corroboration of information.&quot; She is keen to return to her country and see how much has changed. &quot;Tunisia is an example that gives us hope,&quot; she says. Her colleagues in the Netherlands received a recent note from its ministry of justice, an unheard-of occurrence. &quot;I said: &apos;Oh my God! They answered Amnesty!&apos; It&apos;s amazing!&quot; GKR UNITED STATES     Laura Moye: \u2018Four US states have ended the death penalty since 2004\u2019. Photograph: Paul Abell/AP    LAURA MOYE - Death penalty abolition campaign director, USA, 35 The daughter of former missionaries, Laura Moye was raised &quot;to speak up for social justice&quot;, and during high school campaigned and performed in plays about human rights. But it was at university, hearing relatives of death row prisoners speak at an Amnesty conference, that her career path was determined. &quot;I was totally blown away by the experience,&quot; she says. &quot;I had some notion that the United States wasn&apos;t perfect but I wasn&apos;t aware of the extent to which the criminal justice system here is riddled with injustice.&quot; Moye has since dedicated the past 13 years to campaigning against capital punishment for Amnesty, posted first in America&apos;s southern states and since 2009 as death penalty abolition campaign director nationwide. She raises awareness through public speaking, media work and preparing reports, lobbying legislators and writing letters on behalf of death row prisoners. Moye laments the failure of US administrations \u2013 even President Obama&apos;s \u2013 to take a lead on the issue. &quot;The government will always say &apos;this is a state issue, it&apos;s not our responsibility&apos;.&quot; But revelations that 139 prisoners since 1973 have been exonerated on all charges and freed from death row have fuelled the abolition debate. &quot;They&apos;ve shaken people&apos;s confidence in the US criminal justice system. Four states have ended the death penalty since 2004, and death sentences are on the downturn.&quot; She&apos;s proudest of Amnesty&apos;s work on behalf of Troy Davis, an African American man sent to death row in 1991 who has had three stays of\u00a0execution as Amnesty continues to help unravel the case against him. Moye acknowledges that it can be an emotionally draining job. &quot;The pro-death penalty crowd use very emotionally charged language, describing murders very graphically, appealing to people&apos;s sense of moral outrage&quot;, because, she says, &quot;they don&apos;t have a whole lot of statistics to benefit them since the death penalty is expensive and doesn&apos;t deter crime&quot;. The ability to stay calm and objective is crucial. &quot;You have to not get so emotionally attached that it&apos;s devastating when you suffer a loss because that wouldn&apos;t be sustainable for my long-term commitment to the issue.&quot; IC AFGHANISTAN      Horia Mosadiq meets Afghan officials in Kandahar province to discuss prison conditions.  Photograph: Amnesty International    HORIA MOSADIQ - Afghanistan researcher, 36  Horia Mosadiq was a journalism student at Kabul university in 1992, during the Afghan civil war. She and her friends would attend lectures between bursts of fierce fighting. One day they were told that a fellow student had been gang-raped and murdered in the basement of a faculty building. The university dean recommended, off the record, that the female students stay at home from then on. When Mosadiq&apos;s family home was bombed, and her husband&apos;s leg had to be amputated after it was hit by rocket shrapnel, the family finally decided they could no longer stay in Afghanistan. They fled to Pakistan in 1995. Working in Islamabad as a journalist for the American news agency United Press International, Mosadiq was inspired by Amnesty International&apos;s work in her homeland. &quot;The only voice I could hear was Amnesty&apos;s, calling on all parties not to target civilians, calling for respect for human rights. Everyone else was quiet. But not Amnesty.&quot; She moved back to Afghanistan in 2002 after the American and British invasion, and jumped at the chance to work for Amnesty&apos;s Kabul office. She spent a year as an interpreter and translator, deciphering documents and helping to interview prisoners, before the office closed in 2003. She continued to work for other human rights agencies, and in 2007 brought victims of war crimes to testify before the Afghan president. The repercussions were severe. Her husband&apos;s car was shot at, her eldest daughter was stabbed in the face and her three children faced many threats of kidnap. In 2008 she and her family were evacuated by Amnesty to London. &quot;I feel guilty that my children and husband should be the ones that pay the price for what I do,&quot; she says, remembering that time. &quot;If it was only me, I wouldn&apos;t care.&quot; In London, Mosadiq began to work for Amnesty again and now goes on regular fact-finding missions to Afghanistan. Her main focus these days is the reconciliation process between the government and the Taliban. &quot;We want to make sure that ordinary Afghanis&apos; rights and women&apos;s rights are not compromised. We are in frequent contact with women&apos;s groups in Afghanistan to make sure they are represented in the whole political process,&quot; she says. Amnesty&apos;s influence saw the government allocate 320 seats to women at a Peace Grand Assembly held in Afghanistan last year, an increase from the 20 originally set aside for them. She also argues for the rights of innocent people living in the midst of battle. &quot;We want the law to be respected during military operations. Whatever happens, civilians, particularly women and children, should be protected, and any casualties should be reported correctly.&quot; HoriaMosadiq&apos;s family has been attacked because of her human rights work.GKR ZIMBABWE     Cousin Zilala: \u2018You have to be able to look your children in the eye\u2019    COUSIN ZILALA - Director of Amnesty International in Zimbabwe, 40  Cousin Zilala was 14 when he decided he wanted to work in human rights. He had just witnessed a massacre in his home province of Mberengwa in Zimbabwe, where members of his tribe had been slaughtered by government soldiers. The memory of that day changed him for ever. &quot;It sounds like the idealistic dreams of a child but that day I decided there was good and bad in this world, and I was fighting on the side of good,&quot; he says. &quot;Whenever I think back to this moment, I feel that passion again.&quot; Zilala went on to study human rights and law and then dedicated his adult life to helping to build up the human rights and civil society movement in Zimbabwe. In the late 1990s Amnesty&apos;s operations in Zimbabwe fell into crisis after the organisation was infiltrated by government intelligence agents. For the following seven years Amnesty was run by volunteers, often working incognito, until Zilala was brought in as director in 2006 to relaunch operations. Today, despite new procedures Zilala has put in place to ensure that the organisation is never compromised again, their work remains limited. While the national office leads on more general human rights campaigns such as violence against women, they still often steer clear of direct campaigning on sensitive political issues, which are instead taken on by other Amnesty offices around the world. &quot;Although we recognise this as a necessary security measure, there is understandably a demand from our own people that we speak up for victims of human rights abuses, including unlawful arrests and political detentions,&quot; he says. &quot;We have to stay relevant while at the same time protecting our own staff, so it&apos;s a very difficult line to tread.&quot; Working on human rights in Zimbabwe is still a dangerous and precarious profession. Zilala says that while in the past human rights had some standing in political circles, they are now considered to be part of the opposition. Although he believes he is personally shielded by the Amnesty brand, many human rights workers are still harassed or arrested without warning. With fears that the precarious coalition government will collapse and the country will be pushed into early elections this year, he paints a grim picture of the months ahead. &quot;Despite the promises of the government, police harassment continues, political violence continues and is getting worse,&quot; he says. Zilala is also conscious that he is a family man as well as a human rights worker. He jokes that he has taught his children so well that they now demand he enforce their rights to more television and later curfews. &quot;You have to weigh up the risks you take with regard to your family responsibilities,&quot; he says. &quot;But at the end of the day nobody can liberate you unless you do it yourself.

From 3-8 April 2011, government delegates, representatives from business and industry, environmental organisations and research institutions will meet in Bangkok, Thailand, to build on an international deal on cutting carbon emissions. The first of three UN climate change conferences this year, the Bangkok talks will aim to improve an agreement reached at Canc\u00fan last year in order to secure a successor to the Kyoto protocol, which expires at the end of 2012. Who is taking part in the talks? The conference will have 1,500 participants from 173 countries. What were the outcomes of the Canc\u00fan climate conference? The conference began on a low note after delegates failed to reach an agreement at Copenhagen. A modest deal was reached in the final hours of the talks, in which countries pledged to meet emissions targets, although none of these commitments were legally binding. Countries also reiterated their intention to limit average global temperature rises to 2C above pre-industrial levels. In addition, a forest deal (Redd) will provide finance for countries who avoid emissions from deforestation. A green fund, which will provide poorer countries with funding to decarbonise their economies and adapt to climate change, will initially provide $30bn to developing countries, potentially rising to $100bn in 2020. The only resistance came from Bolivia, who said that decisions had been made without consensus and that the agreement did not go far enough to prevent climate change. What are the hopes for Bangkok? The conference will provide an update on progress of the Canc\u00fan agreements and settle a plan for this year&apos;s negotiations, at the COP17 summit in Durban, South Africa in November. It is hoped that delegates will lay the groundwork for a new deal on emission targets, so that an internationally binding commitment to reduce emissions can be reached before Kyoto expires next year. What are the key sticking points? The targets for emissions agreed at Canc\u00fan would set the world on course for 3.2C warming (according to researchers from the Climate Action Tracker), which could have devastating environmental consequences. This will need to be revisited, and any agreement should be legally binding. It is thought that Japan&apos;s nuclear crisis may also have an impact on talks because it has prompted nations to reconsider energy policies. Senior environment ministry officials in Japan have indicated that the country may have to revisit its own goals for cutting greenhouse gases as it attempts to grasp the impact of the crisis and the realities of post-quake reconstruction. What will happen after Bangkok? There will be further talks at the conference in Bonn in Germany this June.

Writing in the British Medical Journal on Tuesday, a group of military and medical experts, including two rear admirals and two professors of health, sent out an urgent message to governments around the world. &quot;Climate change poses an immediate and grave threat, driving ill-health and increasing the risk of conflict, such that each feeds upon the other,&quot; said the authors, Lionel Jarvis, surgeon rear admiral at the UK&apos;s Ministry of Defence; Hugh Montgomery, professor of human health at UCL, London; Neil Morisetti, rear admiral and climate and security envoy for the UK; and Ian Gilmore, professor at the Royal Liverpool hospital. &quot;Like all good medicine, prevention is the key.&quot; The threat to national security and health from global warming have been addressed separately in the past, but the BMJ editorial urges governments to treat them together. &quot;It might be considered unusual for the medical and military professions to concur,&quot; wrote the authors. &quot;But on this subject we do.&quot; The authors urge doctors to use their position of trust in society to build support for action on climate change. &quot;Although discussion is good, we can no longer delay implementing tough action that will make a difference, while quibbling over minor uncertainties in climate modelling. Unlike most recent natural disasters, this one is entirely predictable,&quot; they warned. &quot;Doctors, often seen as authoritative, trusted, and independent by their communities, must make their voices heard in calling for such action.&quot; Prof Montgomery told the Guardian that doctors should take up the climate challenge just as they did with the harm from tobacco. &quot;Many doctors see suffering and death first-hand on a daily basis. They recognise that prevention is far better than waiting for disease, when cure may not in fact be possible. They are also uniquely able to translate abstract harm into a vision of real suffering- just as they were with cigarette smoking and lung cancer,&quot; he said. &quot;Now, as then, they must play their part - impressing upon their governments the immediacy and gravity of climate change and its impacts on their citizens, and those of other countries.&quot; Prof Gilmore added that doctors could have an influence both as a body and in their individual work: &quot;Some of the things that are good for health are also good for the climate, like exercise and a diet that is lower in meat. That&apos;s a win-win situation.&quot; But doctors could also influence government policy, and the NHS&apos;s policy on greenhouse gases, he said: &quot;We have a responsibility to steer the government towards more climate-sensitive policies.&quot; Such a call is likely to be seen as controversial by many in the medical profession, and beyond it, particularly in the light of last year&apos;s &quot;climategate&quot; controversy in which many scientists found themselves under attack from commentators and bloggers. While medical journals have highlighted the problems of climate change in the past, few physicians have spoken out on the issue. The warning from medical and military leaders came as government officials from around the world met in Bangkok in the latest round of the long-running talks under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Bangkok conference, which is a preliminary session to the major meeting in Durban this December, is low-key and not expected to produce a breakthrough. Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UNFCCC, told the conference that Bangkok was an opportunity to consolidate the gains made at last year&apos;s Canc\u00fan climate conference, when several important issues - including forestry - were broadly resolved. &quot;Here in Bangkok, governments have the early opportunity to push ahead to complete the concrete work they agreed in Canc\u00fan, and to chart a way forward that will ensure renewed success at the next UN climate change conference in Durban,&quot; she said. &quot;If governments move forward in the continued spirit of flexibility and compromise that inspired them in Mexico, then I&apos;m confident they can make significant new progress in 2011.&quot; But several major issues remain to be resolved, she acknowledged, including the future of the Kyoto protocol and building the institutions necessary to deliver greenhouse gas emissions cuts and financing. The BMJ&apos;s warning, carried in an editorial in the magazine, drew on several sources, including the Pentagon&apos;s 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review to Congress, which highlighted the national security aspects of climate change, and statements from the UK&apos;s ministry of defence and the foreign secretary, William Hague, who called global warming &quot;perhaps the 21st century&apos;s biggest foreign policy challenge&quot;. The BMJ authors found that climate change would exacerbate &quot;poverty, environmental degradation, and the further weakening of fragile governments&quot;. But the scale of the challenge is such that the involvement of doctors and tough actions on emissions are necessary, according to the authors. &quot;We must adapt our cities and their infrastructure to cope with these challenges through combining engineering design and public health initiatives \u2013 for example, developing resilience in clean water and drainage systems, using human and food waste for energy generation, and building roads to act as flood pathways. At the same time we need to ensure that the military can still operate effectively to sustain security in this changing environment. As with prevention, effective adaptation will require an approach that encompasses the whole of society and international collaboration.&quot; The editorial was published ahead of an open meeting on climate change, medicine and security, scheduled to take place on 20 June at the British Medical Association in London.", "publicationDate": "2011-04-05T22:30:00Z", "tags": ["Climate change", "Global climate talks", "Environment", "Doctors", "Health", "Society", "UK news", "Climate change", "Science"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/05/doctors-climate-change-leadership", "title": "Doctors urged to take climate leadership role", "sentences": ["The warning from medical and military leaders came as government officials from around the world met in Bangkok in the latest round of the long-running talks under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).", "The Bangkok conference, which is a preliminary session to the major meeting in Durban this December, is low-key and not expected to produce a breakthrough.", "Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UNFCCC, told the conference that Bangkok was an opportunity to consolidate the gains made at last year&apos;s Canc\u00fan climate conference, when several important issues - including forestry - were broadly resolved.", "&quot;Here in Bangkok, governments have the early opportunity to push ahead to complete the concrete work they agreed in Canc\u00fan, and to chart a way forward that will ensure renewed success at the next UN climate change conference in Durban,&quot; she said."]}, {"article": "Climate and energy \u2022 Loophole in energy bill could see UK taxpayers funding nuclear bailouts\u2022 World Bank to limit funding for coal-fired power stations\u2022 Japanese turn to paper and sawdust to plug Fukushima nuclear leak\u2022 Q&amp;A: UN climate change conference in Bangkok Conservation and wildlife     Photo issued by the Scottish Wildlife Trust of the UK's oldest breeding female osprey appears close to death at Loch of the Lowes wildlife reserve in Perthshire.

Considering the then Sunderland manager earned a couple of million a year, the words &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;platitude&quot; sprang to mind. Such cynicism did him a considerable disservice. In a profession where too many individuals are motivated primarily by greed Reid, now in charge of Plymouth Argyle, is a shining exception. For a fourth consecutive month Reid\u00a0is working without pay at a debt-ridden club so impoverished that the lights are on and the radiators warm only courtesy of his willingness to fund four-figure electricity and heating bills. To shrug and say the former England midfielder can afford it is to miss the\u00a0point. Reid&apos;s job involves holding the Pilgrims together until a new owner is found while also endeavouring to overcome a 10-point deduction incurred for entering administration and which has handed them near certain relegation. All this involves inspiring his threadbare squad, reliant on PFA loans after going unpaid since Christmas, to continue playing without pay. The sheer force of the 54-year-old Merseysider&apos;s personality ensured that Rory Fallon, a New Zealand striker, recently rejected an income-guaranteeing loan move to Bristol Rovers in order to continue fighting Plymouth&apos;s corner. Argyle&apos;s cause may look lost as they sit bottom of League One but in supporting it Reid, whose tenacious midfield talents helped Everton to the 1985 and 1987 league titles among other things, has helped stir football&apos;s slumbering\u00a0soul. Despite lacking previous connections with the area, Reid&apos;s love of the game and respect for a famous old club and their fans transcends parochial preferences. &quot;If I&apos;d known what I know now I might not have come here last June, but this club gets hold of you,&quot; he says. &quot;The important thing is to maintain our dignity and work ethic \u2013\u00a0and to remember that Plymouth Argyle matters more than individuals.&quot; If many Devonians believe Reid&apos;s actions to be among the most defiantly heroic in their locale since Sir Francis Drake insisted on completing his game of bowls on the Hoe before seeing off the Spanish Armada, others are amazed that the rough-tongued star of BBC&apos;s 1998 documentary series Premier Passions is proving to be such a diamond. Swearing tirades punctuated Premier Passions \u2013 one high-velocity expletive blitz aimed at Chris Waddle lingers in the memory \u2013 and depicted a worryingly one-dimensional bully but Reid&apos;s often complicated and, sometimes, contradictory character has always defied easy caricatures. Although an underachieving Sunderland player was once reduced to a shivering, pale wreck when, having missed the team bus after an away game he discovered the manager had volunteered to drive him home, Reid generally proved to be much nicer than advertised. On leaving Wearside he invited a local reporter to an alcohol-fuelled farewell dinner before, late in the evening, happily swapping his Armani shirt for our man&apos;s M&amp;S number. It is hard to imagine Ars\u00e8ne Wenger doing likewise. There was also the time when Michael Gray spent several morale-restoring days as his house guest after the distraught left-back has missed a decisive playoff final penalty for Sunderland against Charlton. Some less saintly cameos leaven plenty of other Good Samaritan deeds but for every skeleton in the cupboard there are probably at least three beneficiaries of Reid&apos;s generosity. It comes spiced with a sharply robust humour honed while playing for Huyton boys, coached by his old friend, the dramatist Alan Bleasdale. When Newcastle fans dubbed Reid &quot;Monkey Heed&quot; before waving &quot;Save the Chimp&quot; placards in his face, he shared the joke, tackling the Great North Run wearing a T-shirt adorned by a primate&apos;s visage. A personal watershed came in Bangkok, where he was Thailand&apos;s coach. Suddenly, more genteel people and a fixation with preserving public face meant swearing and shouting at players was taboo. Doing things differently became de rigueur.

To take only one other example, the ethnic strife in Sri Lanka, at the same time, resulted in up to 20 times the number of civilian deaths, but this civil war never seemed to concern the UN human rights council or your paper to the same or a proportionate degree. The UNHRC, which commissioned the Goldstone report, is a tainted political body. Only a few years ago it was chaired by Libya, whose membership has just been suspended. Other members include Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, presently slaughtering their own people protesting for democracy. The council is currently chaired by a Thai representative, whose government was criticised earlier this year for failure to fulfil its pledges to hold human rights abusers accountable in 2010. At least 90 people died and 2,000 were injured in street battles in Bangkok. As Jonathan Freedland points out in his article (Where&apos;s the Goldstone report into Sri Lanka, Congo, Darfur \u2013 or Britain?, 6 April), it is Israel that is singled out at every UNHRC meeting, while the much greater need to control human rights abuses in some of its member states or their associates is ignored. Freedland also makes the point that much current Arab unrest is due to their own governmental problems, not the failure to settle the Israel-Palestine dispute, customarily blamed for all the ills of the Middle East. Michael Steel Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire \u2022\u2008Jonathan Freedland is right to highlight the disparity in the treatment of Israel and other states in the Middle East, not to say the rest of the world. What his article lacks, however, is an acknowledgment that this emphasis on Israel is due in no small part to western foreign policy which has kept the despots and dictators in place in &quot;Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Yemen, Syria and Bahrain&quot;, while giving Israel free rein to oppress the Palestinians and colonise their land. Hosni Mubarak was kept in power by the US because he played the game and put Israel&apos;s interests above those of his own people. Israel&apos;s abysmal human rights record continues thanks to US political, military and financial support. In reality Israel couldn&apos;t care less about &quot;bias&quot; in the &quot;academic, cultural and, yes, the media sphere&quot; as long as US backing is there for the ongoing expansion of the territory it controls. Sure, let us have &quot;Goldstone reports&quot; on other countries and bring them up to speed on human rights and international laws, but Freedland appears to be saying that if we can&apos;t have them all then Israel should be let off the hook. If that happens, it will prove the point that Israel deserves a greater &quot;volume of attention&quot; precisely because it is allowed by its western sponsors to act with impunity. Ibrahim Hewitt Senior editor, Middle East Monitor \u2022\u2008While Arab regimes are oppressive to maintain the governments in power, Israel&apos;s oppression goes to the heart of its existence as a state to which Jews from around the world have more right to live than the native non-Jewish population. This involves the ethnic cleansing of the native Arab population in order to secure and maintain a Jewish majority. Other states have carried out ethnic cleansing in the past. But Israel owes its ethno-religious majority to a recent, current and ongoing campaign of displacement of the indigenous population. That was true of the US, it was true of Australia. It has been true of many states. But Israel&apos;s crimes are more recent and, therefore, its continued existence is predicated on its human rights. Mark Elf Dagenham, Essex \u2022 Western hypocrisy is the reason that so many people focus on the particular conduct of Israel. When a single Chinese dissident disappears the US, Britain and others instantly respond (Report, 4 April). When the Israeli government was killing 700 civilians in Gaza, the US, British and other western governments said nothing.

The world No10 rang the organising body last Thursday asking to be left out of the tournament, which starts this weekend, but when he was asked for a written confirmation he had a change of heart and decided to go through with his first-round match against Dominic Dale, which starts on Monday. However, he will now work with Dr Steve Peters, a psychiatrist who helped the highly successful Great Britain cycling\u00a0squad at the 2008 Olympics and also has a role with Team Sky. &quot;A friend said to me in China that I should see this bloke. I&apos;ll try anything that might work,&quot; O&apos;Sullivan said. He is hoping that Peters will help him rediscover his appetite for the game following the four least productive months of his career and mount a serious challenge for a fourth world title. A spokesman for Peters said the two had yet to meet to discuss their way forward. Since taking the Premier League title in late November, O&apos;Sullivan has not won a match and has this season withdrawn from two major ranking events, the Shanghai Masters and the German Masters, and 10 of the 12 minor ones that comprise the new Players Tour Championship. When he has played, his form has been patchy, his resolve easily broken. He has shown a desire to play only if the result is immaterial, such as when he made six centuries in eight frames in an exhibition he co\u2011promoted in Blackburn. Away from the table, his relationship with Jo Langley, the mother of his two youngest children, ended in a protracted financial dispute, which has hardly helped his preparations. Peter Ebdon, the world No13, felt it would be good for the game if O&apos;Sullivan could recapture his best form. &quot;If the real O&apos;Sullivan turns up against the real John Higgins, or the real Ding Junhui, or a number of other top players when they&apos;re really playing on top of their game, we really could have fireworks,&quot; the 2002 champion said yesterday. &quot;This could be one of the best world championships we&apos;ve ever seen, and I think it&apos;s very, very open.&quot; O&apos;Sullivan&apos;s problems appear to stem from his father&apos;s 18-year sentence for murder in 1992. The 15-year-old was in Bangkok as the hot favourite for the World Amateur Championship when news of his father&apos;s arrest came through and he lost in the last 16 to a player he should have beaten comfortably. His problems, whatever their tangled roots, have added to the already huge pressures of championship play and have often been too much for him. In 1996 he admitted to assaulting a media official at the world championships and was handed a two-year suspended ban and a \u00a320,000 fine with an additional \u00a310,000 donated to charity. At the 2006 UK Championship, trailing 4-1 to Stephen Hendry, he missed a red then shook hands with Hendry and the referee and walked out. &quot;I got annoyed with myself and lost my patience,&quot; he said, before being fined \u00a321,000. More recently, after a 5-4 defeat to Marco Fu in Beijing in 2008, O&apos;Sullivan simulated a sex act on the microphone at his press conference, asking a reporter &quot;Do you want to suck that?&quot; He later apologised. Nevertheless, he has been world champion three times, in 2001, 2004 and 2008, and has been the world&apos;s No1 player on five occasions, winning 22 ranking titles.", "publicationDate": "2011-04-13T19:50:30Z", "tags": ["Ronnie O'Sullivan", "Snooker", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/apr/13/ronnie-osullivan-world-snooker-championship", "title": "Ronnie O'Sullivan seeks psychiatrist's help before world championship", "sentences": ["The 15-year-old was in Bangkok as the hot favourite for the World Amateur Championship when news of his father&apos;s arrest came through and he lost in the last 16 to a player he should have beaten comfortably."]}, {"article": "I&apos;ve just arrived in Bangkok for a report on tiger conservation, (more on that later), but the big environment story in south-east Asia this week is without doubt the upcoming decision on the proposed Xayaburi dam in Laos. I reported last year on the dispute surrounding this project, which poses a risk to some of the world&apos;s biggest freshwater fish. Conservationists warn that the 820m barrier threatens catfish the length of cars and stingrays that weigh more than tigers. The Laotian government counters that economic benefits outweigh the environmental impact. The Mekong River Commission gathers in Vientiane tomorrow to consider the Xayaburi (also spelled Sayabouly) dam. On Friday, they are expected to make a final recommendation to the four member states: Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. It will be the biggest decision ever taken by the commission, which was set up in 1995 to share the resources of south-east Asia&apos;s most important river.  But approval already seems to have been taken for granted. In the past two days, the Bangkok Post and New York Times have reported that residents are being moved out of the area and preparatory work on the dam is already underway. In an editorial headed &quot;Shame on the dam builders&quot;, the Post said the approval process had hit an &quot;abysmal low&quot;.  &quot;The sham promise to consult and then to decide whether to build Xayaburi should stand as an example of how not to proceed with huge public projects. Authorities involved should be ashamed of misleading their people and civil society.&quot;  Serious doubts about the plan persist. The Mekong River Commission&apos;s technical reports on the dam admits there is a strong possibility that the giant catfish could become extinct and that fish ladders and other measures were unlikely to prevent risks to the migration patterns of up to 100 species.  &quot;There are no obvious design modifications beyond those proposed that can further mitigate these issues...The potential disruption of downstream migration and drift could have serious ramifications for maintaining the fishery production for this region.&quot;  Scientists and environment groups have united to condemn the project. WWF warned the environmental impact assessment was flawed and scientific advice had been ignored.   &quot;WWF fears a much larger scale repeat of the environmental damage of the dam on the Mun River in Thailand, a key Mekong tributary. After similar bland assurances of only low level impacts on fisheries prior to construction, the first decade of the dam&apos;s operation saw damaging impacts on 85 per cent of fish species present before the dam&apos;s construction, with 56 species disappearing entirely and reduced catches for a further 169 species, according to a World Commission on Dams study.&quot;  The potential impact on food security is enormous, warns Aviva Imhof of International Rivers in this opinion piece:   &quot;The Mekong River - known locally as the &quot;Mother of all Rivers&quot; - is the world&apos;s largest inland fishery. This fishery constitutes the primary source of protein for the majority of the basin&apos;s 60 million inhabitants, many of whom are subsistence farmers. To harm the fishery is to harm the food security of the region&apos;s poor.&quot;  A coalition of 263 NGOs sent a joint letter to the prime minister of Laos Thongsing Thammavong urging him to reject the plan, but received no response. They might have been better off addressing it to the premier of Thailand, the country which has most to gain from the project. A Thai construction firm - Ch. Karnchang - will build the hydropower plant. The Thai utility EGAT will buy almost all of the electricity. No surprise then that the Thai government are backing the project on the international stage. Officials from Cambodia and Vietnam have objected to the plan, which could reduce the water flow needed by their fishermen and paddy farmers. But they too want to build hydropower plants in their own countries.  For Laos, this is just the start. The government wants revenues from hydropower to develop an impoverished nation. If the 1,285 MW plant at Xayaburi goes ahead, it wants to build a cascade of 10 more dams on the Mekong. China \u2013 which has refused to even join the Mekong River Commission - has pressed still further ahead with four huge hydropower projects upstream.  It seems the &quot;Mother of all rivers&quot; is increasingly being milked for power instead of nutrition. Given how much cropland is also now being turned over to biofuels, is it any wonder that the world faces a food crisis.", "publicationDate": "2011-04-18T10:20:22Z", "tags": ["Environment", "Water", "Rivers", "Wave and tidal power", "Conservation", "Endangered habitats", "Endangered species", "WWF", "Fishing", "Laos", "Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/apr/18/mekong-hydropower-xayaburi-laos", "title": "Decision looms on Mekong River dam opposed by conservation groups | jonathan watts", "sentences": ["I&apos;ve just arrived in Bangkok for a report on tiger conservation, (more on that later), but the big environment story in south-east Asia this week is without doubt the upcoming decision on the proposed Xayaburi dam in Laos.", "In the past two days, the Bangkok Post and New York Times have reported that residents are being moved out of the area and preparatory work on the dam is already underway."]}, {"article": "Jess on William First impressions?

India, Singapore and Thailand can offer high quality medical procedures with English-speaking doctors at a fraction of the cost incurred in the west. However, despite its benefits in generating income, one prominent Thai economist, Ammar Siamwala, has described the intention to create an international medical hub in Thailand as an &quot;evil plan&quot; that will adversely affect health treatment for the poor. More than 1.6 million foreigners are treated in Thai hospitals annually, with an estimated 500,000 travelling specifically for medical treatment. These are phenomenal figures given the nascent state of the medical tourist industry only a few years ago. The former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra initially proposed making Thailand an international leader in medical tourism in 2003 through aggressively marketing the country as a medical hub and curbing restrictions on foreign doctors practising there. Proponents for this policy argue that it will provide huge financial benefits for Thailand. Indeed, the foreign medical services sector is already expected to make 100bn baht ($3.3bn) by 2015. The government also states that it will create more medical expertise and greater accessibility to new medical equipment. Additionally, it could help reverse the &quot;brain drain&quot; away from western countries by attracting highly qualified Thai doctors living abroad back to Thailand. However, Ammar has described the medical-hub plan as &quot;the worst policy that the government could ever think of&quot;. The salary for doctors is about 8-10 times more in a private clinic than in a state hospital, so Ammar warns that private expansion will result in even greater wage inflation in the state sector. &quot;The ministry has already increased their salaries again and again [but it&apos;s] never enough. How can they compete with the private sector?&quot; Dr Amphon Jindawattana, secretary general of the National Health Commission of Thailand (NHC) agrees, saying: &quot;The medical-hub policy is the accelerator causing the brain drain of doctors, super specialists and other medical workers to private hospitals.&quot; Thailand already has a shortage of doctors compared with other countries in the region, and health reforms to expand provision to the low paid have put a greater burden on the public health system. However, in 2005 the government only managed to train 1,300 doctors, and saw nearly 700 doctors resign in the same period \u2013 many to work in the expanding private sector. The Rural Doctors Society is also scathing in its criticism of foreign medical expansion. Bangkok already has eight times as many doctors per capita as the worst served rural regions, and the RDS points out that concentrating resources in the large cities will simply worsen these discrepancies. There are also concerns over the growing divergence between state and private health provision. Some of the big private hospitals now resemble five-star hotels. Doormen will guide you to a gleaming marble foyer before elevator attendants take you to your waiting room. These &quot;hotel-spitals&quot;, designed specifically for the needs of foreign patients, mean that the Thai middle classes are increasingly unable to afford private healthcare provision at these centres. Erik Cohen, an emeritus professor in the faculty of social sciences at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, predicts that the big private Thai hospitals will inevitably expand to become greater regional providers of services, and that western governments and insurance companies will increasingly look to outsource patients to reduce costs and waiting lists. Indeed, one academic projection estimates that by 2015 foreign patients will require resources equivalent to between 23%-34% of the total number of doctors currently working in the private sector. One possible solution for Thailand will be to exploit the upcoming liberalisation of doctor movement between south-east Asian nations and import doctors from other countries in the region. However, this will have an adverse affect on countries such as Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia \u2013 and Thailand may soon become responsible for causing a regional brain drain of its own. The explosive growth in medical tourism will have a significant impact on the healthcare systems of countries like Thailand. However, more important than either private sector lobbying or the benefits for medical tourists are the health needs of the local populace. Strong safeguards, such as a significant medical services tax and greater investment in medical training, need to be in place to ensure that they too benefit from the globalisation of healthcare and the medical tourism revolution.", "publicationDate": "2011-04-26T10:54:51Z", "tags": ["Global development", "Thailand", "World news", "ent and tourismHospitality, event managem", "Healthcare industry", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/apr/26/thailand-medical-tourism-divides-professionals", "title": "Thai embrace of medical tourism divides professionals | Andrew Chambers", "sentences": ["Bangkok already has eight times as many doctors per capita as the worst served rural regions, and the RDS points out that concentrating resources in the large cities will simply worsen these discrepancies."]}, {"article": "Thor (12A) (Kenneth Branagh, 2011, US) Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston, Anthony Hopkins, Kat Dennings, Idris Elba. 114 mins Let the silly season commence with this expensive comic-book movie, which takes full advantage of its second-tier superhero, free casting rein and Asgard-sized budget to deliver some premium disposable spectacle.

People, he said, would be going to supermarkets to stock up on food and drink, and this would be good for the &quot;hard-hit retail sector&quot;. What I fail to understand is, if sitting in front of the telly getting bladdered and shoving kettle chips down our gullets is so good for the economy, why don&apos;t we all do it all the time? I decided to take his advice anyway, hoping the general principle would hold true even if it were not the wedding I was watching. Problem was, the family wanted to watch it, so I caught bits, before my furious flipping drove them from the room. It is not the royal family per se that I object to \u2013 although I do not think they are anywhere near as funny as they used to be \u2013 but the never-ending torrent of forelock-tugging gush from the likes of Huw Edwards. The wedding, said Huw, &quot;makes a powerful statement&quot;, something about Kate bringing a &quot;refreshing informality&quot; (copyright: all newspapers, radio, TV) to the old firm. Like most commentators, Huw, who had had his brain removed for the day \u2013 I think it&apos;s the law \u2013 and replaced with a clockwork mouse channelling the thoughts of the late Barbara Cartland, marvelled at the marvellousness of everything. As Kate was driven through Admiralty Arch, he noted approvingly: &quot;Through the narrow arch, safely negotiated.&quot; Blimey. I live near a private school where most of the mums turn up in 4x4 vehicles to collect their precious ones, and seem about as familiar with the width of their cars as they are with the cut-price offers at Iceland, and even 20 or 25% of them, I wager, could drive through Admiralty Arch. I shall tell you what is a difficult skill: piloting one ton of rampaging water buffalo in a race over 110 metres at speeds of up to 50 kilometres an hour. That is what I was watching Dan Yansri do in Thailand&apos;s Chonburi province at the very moment vows were being exchanged at the abbey \u2013 which I felt was making a pretty powerful statement in itself (although not quite as powerful as Wakefield&apos;s refuse collectors, who were emptying my wheelie bin during the ceremony. Good work, chaps). The buffalo race is a tradition going back 140 years. In the 1870s, when Chonburi was the trading capital of the eastern seaboard, farmers would use the beasts of burden to transport their goods to market, arguments ensued about who had the best buffalo, and the annual race stemmed from that. The province, 70 kilometres south of Bangkok, is also home to countless wild monkeys. Yes, I have been watching Transworld Sport. I love Transworld Sport because it reminds me of the entirely random short films that used to accompany the main feature at the cinema. You would turn up for the latest Carry On or Bond movie, and find yourself watching a 25-minute short about laying pipelines in the Philippines. I got the impression that the buffalo race is every bit as important a tradition in Chonburi as dressing up and talking tosh about the royal family is here. &quot;For us farmers round here, it&apos;s the main sport,&quot; (they don&apos;t get Channel 4 there, so they have to make their own fun), said jockey Sumit Puamkhun. &quot;We sometimes even have buffalo races back on our farms.&quot; On the Extreme Sports channel, meanwhile, (my family have tried hiding the remote) there were several episodes of Mantracker to divert those of us not buying into the nationalfestival of sycophancy, but without any bin-emptying to occupy us. Mantracker is a reality show where two people are released into the wilds of the Yukon, and two expert trackers on horseback hunt them down. &quot;The Yukon is one hostile territory,&quot; went the narration, &quot;slippery slopes, ice-cold glacial lakes, valley floors that snag both foot and hoof, and very few branches of Starbucks.&quot; (I may have made the Starbucks thing up, but the wilderness does seem to be suspiciously near roads and traffic). The most politically incorrect TV I have ever watched \u2013 including any comedy show from the 70s you care to mention \u2013 was on Mantracker, when two black guys running through the woods were being chased by two grizzled white rednecks \u2013 with ropes, for goodness sake \u2013 on horseback. The cultural resonances seemed to have been entirely missed by the production team. It was one of those things you watch open-mouthed, like the front row in Mel Brooks&apos;s The Producers.

Mindful of Steve Davis&apos;s six Crucible triumphs and Stephen Hendry&apos;s seven, Higgins said he &quot;wants to get to seven because I&apos;ve won three in the last five years&quot;. It was not just the quality of his opponents \u2013 Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan, Mark Williams and Trump in the last three rounds \u2013 that made this &quot;far and away the biggest and best&quot; of his titles. A year earlier, virtually to the day, Higgins was embroiled in allegations that he discussed match fixing, based on information gathered by a News of the World entrapment operation in Kiev. A World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association disciplinary hearing in September fined him \u00a375,000 for failing to report an illegal betting approach and imposed a six-month suspension, most of which had already been served. He did have a reputation to rebuild, but his previous unblemished record and unanimous regard for his professionalism assisted this. In five months he won five tournaments on his way to Sheffield, despite the death of his father, John senior, the linchpin of this very close family, in February. \u00ac He left Sheffield for a brief holiday in Italy with his wife and three children, having earned \u00a3471,970 in prize money since his return to the circuit \u2013 as he needed to in order to recoup his fine, legal and other expenses and lost earnings. But if it was Higgins&apos; title, it was Trump&apos;s tournament as the former junior prodigy followed his breakthrough capture of the China Open five weeks ago with a series of exceptional performances. Ronnie O&apos;Sullivan tweeted that he had never seen long potting like it; Neil Robertson, whose title defence Trump ended in the first round, said that &quot;Judd&apos;s taken attacking snooker to a place where there&apos;s no right or wrong shot. Great to watch.&quot; His potting, fluency and dazzling array of positional shots made him, in 17 days, a new English sporting hero, exuding enjoyment of the challenge, yet, in his unassuming nature, the sort of son every viewing mother would like to have. &quot;I loved it out there,&quot; said Trump. &quot;You only get nerves when you&apos;re scared of missing. I went for my shots. Some went in, some didn&apos;t. &quot;I&apos;ve tried to make the game more popular with younger people. There are a lot of people who don&apos;t really watch snooker and have started watching because of me in these last two weeks, so I&apos;ve got to keep doing my thing and keep a new generation coming through and making kids want to play the game.&quot; He is, nevertheless, aware of the realities of professional sport, saying it was &quot;obviously nice&quot; to hear himself described as snooker&apos;s new superstar, before adding : &quot;But you&apos;re only really remembered when you win titles. You&apos;re not remembered as a loser. Next year there&apos;s going to be a lot of expectation on me. There will be a lot of players who will want to bring me back down to earth.&quot; Following snooker&apos;s transition more than three decades ago from low-profile folk sport to British television phenomenon, it lost some of its public appeal. Under a succession of unimaginative administrations and beset by incessant internal political strife, the circuit progressively contracted. The dwindling number of tournaments meant that young prospects like Trump could not obtain the only thing they were lacking \u2013 experience \u2013 quickly enough: &quot;I got practising but you only had six or seven tournaments a year so it was impossible to get a rhythm going. You&apos;d play in one tournament and have two or three months off.&quot; Everything changed when Barry Hearn took the helm a year ago with a 51% stake in World Snooker. February&apos;s inaugural German Masters in Berlin was a spectacular success; the World Cup is to be revived in Bangkok in July, immediately followed by a new ranking event in Melbourne. September&apos;s Brazilian Masters is the circuit&apos;s first venture into South America. China is pressing for a third ranking event in company with those established in Shanghai and Beijing. A key element in Hearn&apos;s strategy is the new Players Tour Championship, which ran this season with seven events in England, five in continental Europe \u2013 the one in Furth won by Trump \u2013 with the play-offs in Dublin, all carrying scaled down ranking points. The PTC is designed to keep all players busy with earning opportunities and to give venues not quite ready for a full ranking event a step towards one. Germany and Belgium staged such events this season and Denmark, Hungary and Poland (who have a 16 year-old European under-21 champion) are also under consideration for next season. By increasing prize money from last season&apos;s \u00a33.5m to \u00a35m this with a confidently expressed intention that next season&apos;s will top \u00a36m, Hearn&apos;s benevolent despotism has succeeded where more conventional approaches have failed. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 May 2011. In the original, John Higgins&apos;s snooker championship win was said to have garnered one of the highest ever TV audiences for snooker. This was owing to an editing change and has been corrected.

Chatshow hosts are the secular mullahs of modern Pakistan: fist-banging populists who preach to the nation over supper, often through a rightwing lens. Khan, a tubby 50-year-old journalist with neat glasses and a small chin, is the biggest of them. Every night on Geo, the largest channel, he rails against &quot;corrupt&quot; civilian politicians and America, and lionises the armed forces; some colleagues nickname him &quot;the brigadier&quot;. But as the country seethed over Bin Laden last week, Khan tore off his metaphorical stripes and stamped them into the ground. The army had failed its people, he railed. To Pakistan&apos;s shame US soldiers had invaded the country; their finding Bin Laden in Abbottabad, two hours north of Islamabad, was a disgrace. The country&apos;s &quot;two-faced&quot; approach to extremism had disastrously backfired, he said, reeling off a list of atrocities \u2013 New York, Bali, London, Madrid \u2013 linked to Pakistan. &quot;We have become the world&apos;s biggest haven of terrorism,&quot; he declared. &quot;We need to change.&quot; Viewers watched in astonishment. The unprecedented attack targeted not only the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, but also the most sensitive policies of the military&apos;s premier spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (ISI). Feared, reviled and admired in equal measure, the ISI is considered the embodiment of army power in Pakistan, the object of hushed deference. But now, as one US official told me, &quot;the world has changed&quot;. And the ISI finds itself in the line of fire. The Bin Laden debacle has triggered a blizzard of uncomfortable questions, the sharpest come from Washington. How, President Barack Obama wondered aloud last Sunday, could Bin Laden shelter for years in a garrison town that is home to three regimental headquarters, the local version of Sandhurst, and thousands of soldiers? One retired US officer who has served in the region told me he had been mulling the same question. &quot;All those times we drove up to Abbottabad, and we could have taken out our pistols and done the job ourselves,&quot; he said. The CIA chief Leon Panetta, meanwhile, says he didn&apos;t warn the ISI about the special forces raid because he feared word might leak to the al-Qaida leader. Behind the pointed statements lies an urgent question: was the ISI hiding Bin Laden? The answer may lie inside the ISI&apos;s headquarters in Abpara, on the edge of Islamabad. The entrance, beside a private hospital, is suitably discreet: no sign, just a plainclothes officer packing a pistol who direct visitors through a chicane of barriers, soldiers and sniffer dogs. But inside, past the smooth electric gates, lies a neatly tended cluster of adobe buildings separated by smooth lawns and tinkling fountains that resembles a well-funded private university. Cars purr up to the entrance of the central building, a modern structure with a round, echoing lobby. On the top floor sits the chief spy: the director general Ahmed Shuja Pasha, a grey-haired 59-year-old three-star general. One American counterpart describes him as &quot;brilliant and extremely intelligent . . . Thoughtful, pensive and extremely well read; if he was in the US military he would be a very successful officer.&quot; Pasha and the ISI are the heart of Pakistan&apos;s &quot;establishment&quot; \u2013 a nebulous web of generals, bureaucrats and hand-picked politicians (not always elected ones) who form the DNA of Pakistan&apos;s defence and security policies. It has at least 10,000 employees (some say twice as many), mixing serving army officers, many on three-year rotations from other services, with thousands of civilian employees, from suited analysts to beefy street spies. In theory they answer to the prime minister; in reality they are a tool of the army chief, Kayani. To supporters, the ISI safeguards national security \u2013 monitoring phones, guarding the country&apos;s nuclear weapons. But to its many critics, the ISI is the army&apos;s dirty tricks department, accused of abduction and assassination, vote-rigging and torture, and running Islamist terrorist outfits. &quot;The ISI,&quot; said Minoo Bhandara, an outspoken Parsi businessman who ran a brewery across the road from army headquarters before he died in 2008, &quot;is an institution full of intelligence but devoid of wisdom.&quot; Oddly, it was founded by an Australian. As Pakistan recovered from its disastrous first war with India in 1948, Major General R Cawthorne, on secondment from the British army, decided the fledgling military needed a proper intelligence outfit. The first decades were inauspicious. The ISI mishandled the 1965 war with India and failed to predict the East Pakistan conflict in 1971, which sundered Pakistan in two and created Bangladesh. All changed, however, eight years later when Soviet tanks rolled into Afghanistan on Christmas Day 1979. The decade-long war of resistance \u2013 bankrolled by the United States, fought by Afghans and Arabs, but largely run by the ISI from Pakistan&apos;s tribal areas \u2013 revolutionised the agency&apos;s fortunes. It ran a network of secret training camps along the Afghan border that trained more than 80,000 fighters. It controlled a weapons pipeline, funded by the CIA and Saudi intelligence, that smuggled Kalashnikovs and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles from Karachi to the Khyber Pass. And it grew powerful and rich. A legendary figure from that period was a man named Colonel Imam, whom I first met five years ago. He was tall and burly, with a thick beard and a crooked smile that suggested several missing teeth. He wore a white turban and an olive-green, British issue second world war-issue paratroop jacket, which he told me he had been wearing since he joined the army in 1971. During the 80s, Imam ran many of the ISI training camps, becoming popular among ethnic Pashtun fighters for his love of Islam and his fondness for killing Soviets. &quot;Those were wonderful times,&quot; he told me. Although his real name was Sultan Amir, to the Afghans he became &quot;Colonel Imam&quot;. &quot;I loved the fight. And the mujahideen were very fond of me,&quot; he said with a smile. The US liked him too. On the wall of his Rawalpindi home hung war trophies from the 80s \u2013 daggers, faded photos, a Russian general&apos;s gun \u2013 but on the table sat a chunk of the Berlin wall, cased in glass. &quot;To one who helped deliver the first blow,&quot; it read. &quot;The Americans gave me that,&quot; he said. With the Russian withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989, the CIA largely abandoned Pakistan. But the spirit of &quot;jihad&quot; \u2013 fighters imbued with Islamist vim \u2013 lived on in the ISI. Pakistani officers, having imbibed too much of their own ideology, transformed the spy agency. It started to support Islamist groups across Asia \u2013 Bangladesh, Uzbekistan, Burma, India \u2013 and the US placed Pakistan on a terrorist watchlist. In 1993, Javed Ashraf Qazi, a secular-minded general officer, was sent in to clean up the mess. &quot;I was shocked at what I found,&quot; he tells me. Senior ISI officers had jettisoned their uniforms for shalwar kameez; their subordinates would disappear off to the mosque for hours on end. The ISI had bought a hotel in Bangkok, probably to facilitate gun-running. The outgoing spy chief, Javed Nasir, was a playboy turned zealot who had grown a scraggly beard and refused to shake women&apos;s hands. On his first day in the office Qazi found him running out of the door to a Muslim missionary conference. &quot;When people say the ISI is a rogue agency, it was true in those days,&quot; he says. Qazi fired the ideologues, sold the hotel and ordered his subordinates to wear their uniforms (some struggled to fit in them). &quot;We cleaned it up,&quot; says Qazi, who later became a minister under Pervez Musharraf. But the ISI was not done with jihad; it had merely narrowed its focus. The proof is on the wall of Qazi&apos;s home. I notice an unusual rifle hanging on the wall. It is an Indian service rifle, Qazi admits half bashfully \u2013 a present from one of the &quot;mujahideen&quot; fighters the ISI started to send into Indian-occupied Kashmir from the mid 90s, when he was in charge. &quot;We turned a blind eye to some groups,&quot; he says. They included Lashkar-e-Toiba, he admits \u2013 the terrorist outfit that in 2008 would attack hotels and train stations in the Indian city of Mumbai, killing 170 people. In the early 90s, the ISI also started to support an obscure Islamist movement in Afghanistan called the Taliban. Colonel Imam was sent back into Afghanistan to advise the one-eyed Taliban leader Mullah Omar. They had history: Imam, it turned out, had trained Omar back in the mujahideen camps in the 80s. With ISI backing, the Taliban swept to power in Kabul; at the UN in New York, a beleaguered Afghan official complained that Imam was the &quot;de facto governor&quot; of the newly conquered territories. &quot;Ah, they are naughty people,&quot; Imam told me of the Taliban with his shy smile. &quot;Rough people, good fighters, but respected. And they were all my friends.&quot; Over the past decade, however, the ISI has professed to have abandoned jihad. As American troops swarmed across Afghanistan, in search of Bin Laden in late 2001, President General Pervez Musharraf disavowed the Taliban, sacked his most Islamist generals (including the then ISI director, Mahmud Ahmed) and brought Colonel Imam home. The following January he made a signature speech banning a slew of jihadi groups. &quot;We need to rid society of extremism,&quot; he declared. On the ground, though, things have looked different. US diplomatic cables released through WikiLeaks last year claimed the ISI was still covertly supporting the Afghan Taliban, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and the Haqqani network, as part of its decades-old grudge match with India. And despite billions of dollars in American assistance, wrote ambassador Anne Patterson, &quot;no amount of money&quot; was likely to make the army \u2013 or the ISI \u2013 change direction. Simultaneously, though, the ISI has become a victim of jihadi violence. The Pakistani Taliban \u2013 related to the Afghan movement, but separate, and heavily influenced by al-Qaida \u2013 is seeking to oust the Pakistani state. The ISI, deemed to have betrayed them, has become the enemy. Hundreds of ISI officials have died in recent years, killed in bombings of buses and offices, and ISI spies have been beheaded in the tribal belt. In the latest atrocity on 8 March a massive car bomb outside an ISI office in Faisalabad destroyed an airline office and killed 32 people. I last saw Colonel Imam in January 2010 at his home in Rawalpindi. He joked about media articles describing him as the &quot;father of the Taliban&quot;. Weeks later he set off for Waziristan with another former ISI man, Khawaja, and a British journalist, Asad Qureshi, who had been commissioned by Channel 4, to interview the Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud. But the Taliban took them hostage. After a few weeks Khawaja was executed, after confessing on video to being a &quot;CIA spy&quot;. Qureshi was released in September after his family paid a hefty ransom. Then last January, a video of Imam surfaced showing him kneeling before a group of masked, armed men. Mehsud appeared, and said a few words. Then a Talib opened fire, pumped Imam with bullets. &quot;When you&apos;re Frankenstein, and you create a lot of baby monsters who are running round your ankles looking sort of cute, they eventually grow up to be recalcitrant adults,&quot; a US official tells me in Islamabad. &quot;And you hope you can get them back into the fold so they become useful. But the Pakistanis can&apos;t control everything they create.&quot; Could the ISI&apos;s complex policy towards jihadi militants have caused it to harbour Bin Laden? Its many critics have little doubt, particularly in Afghanistan; last week the former Kabul spy chief Amrullah Saleh said he warned Musharraf about Bin Laden four years ago, only to be rowdily shouted down. Now Musharraf himself admits it&apos;s a possibility, albeit one limited to &quot;rogue&quot; officers. Yesterday he told ABC News there was a &quot;possibility&quot; of a &quot;lower-level operative . . . following a policy of his own and violating the policy from above&quot;. But could it be done with the knowledge of the top generals? Opinion is split between agnostics and sceptics. &quot;Did Pasha know? It&apos;s entirely implausible that he didn&apos;t,&quot; says a former western military official who has worked in Pakistan. A senior diplomat sees it differently. Perhaps the ISI is neither complicit or incompetent, he says. Maybe they just didn&apos;t look. &quot;Looking for Osama may not have been a big priority when not finding him earns you billions of dollars a year, and if you did the Americans would leave the region,&quot; he says. The ISI itself points to its consistent record in fighting al-Qaida. Over the past decade it has rounded up hundreds of Islamist suspects, many dispatched to Guant\u00e1namo Bay. They include the most notorious al-Qaida henchmen: Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, architect of the 9/11 attacks, snatched from a Rawalpindi safehouse in 2003; Ramzi bin al-Shibh, captured after a gun battle a year earlier; Abu Faraj al-Libi, then the al-Qaida number three, arrested in Mardan in 2005 by ISI commandos wearing burka disguises. Not finding Bin Laden was &quot;a failure on our side,&quot; admits an ISI official. &quot;Unfortunate, but a fact. We are good but we are not God.&quot; Yet the questions remain. How did Bin Laden avoid ISI surveillance in a military area, just a few hundred metres from a major military base, in a zone where military intelligence traditionally keeps a close eye? And what about the army major who recently built his house just behind Osama&apos;s? Did he not wonder about his neighbour with the barbed-wire fence and the security cameras perched on the wall? &quot;I find it entirely implausible that the military and intelligence agencies knew nothing,&quot; says Dr Farzana Sheikh, author of Making Sense of Pakistan. &quot;There must have been knowledge at the highest levels.&quot; But, along with so many other critics, she concedes &quot;there is no proof&quot;. In a country where so many pressing mysteries remain unresolved \u2013 from the plane crash that killed General Zia ul-Haq in 1988, to the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in 2007 \u2013 few are holding their breath. There could, at least, be accountability, although hopes are fading fast. As television anchors raged and criticism of the army swelled last week, some hoped Pakistan&apos;s civilian leadership would seize the moment to claw back part of the power it has ceded over the past 30 years. Yet those hopes were dashed on Monday when prime minister Gilani stood up in parliament for a stout defence of the generals. &quot;The ISI is a national asset,&quot; he said. The battle, if it had ever been contemplated, was lost. In America the scrutiny will not vanish so easily. Angry congressional leaders have called for Pakistan&apos;s $3bn annual aid package to be slashed; hostile media coverage portraying the ISI as an enemy unit is growing. Government officials, however, are more circumspect. With Nato&apos;s main military supply line running through Pakistan, other al-Qaida figures still at large including Bin Laden&apos;s deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and a peace settlement to be negotiated in Afghanistan, many quietly speak of the need to eventually patch up the Pakistan relationship \u2013 although few doubt that it has been utterly changed over the past 10 days. &quot;We can&apos;t break it, it&apos;s too important,&quot; says one US official. &quot;We&apos;re going to have to sit down across the table and try and tell some truths to each other.&quot; Still, he adds: &quot;There are degrees in truth. We would like to have a degree of the truth.&quot; American popular opinion may be less nuanced. The forthcoming trial of David Headley, an American jihadi accused of helping Lashkar-e-Taiba carry out the Mumbai attacks, is likely to bring fresh accusations of ISI &quot;double-game&quot;. And movie culture is likely to have a strong influence. Even before Bin Laden died an action thriller called tentatively &quot;Kill Bin Laden&quot;, by Oscar-winning director Kathryn Bigelow, was in the works. Now many more will surely follow. In the coming months, casting directors will start seeking actors to play macho navy Seals, a tense American president and an elusive Saudi fugitive. And, almost certainly, they will be looking for a clutch of double-dealing Pakistani spies.

Working with foreign conservationists, the rangers have been gathering evidence from camera traps over the past two years that suggests this single national park in Thailand may have more tigers than China. Thap Lan, with its spectacular forests of saw-bladed plan palms, is an oasis of biodiversity amid expanding human development. Elephants, clouded leopards, spotted linsang, boar and deer thrive below the canopy, which is filled with the song of myna, lapwings, laughing thrushes and other exotic birds. Locals have long insisted that tigers also prowl in this area. Camera traps, triggered by heat and movement, have been left strapped to trees for a month. Some have been destroyed by wild elephants or infested by nesting ants, but the memory cards inside have yielded a treasure trove of images of bears, leopards, itinerant monks, as well as tigers and \u2013 worryingly \u2013 armed poachers. More than half the park has still to be checked, but rangers have already confirmed eight tigers. This is not yet enough to be classified as a sustainable population, but park managers are optimistic more animals will be found. &quot;I&apos;m very happy as this is beyond expectations,&quot; said Thap Lan&apos;s superintendent, Taywin Meesap. &quot;There are areas deeper inside where we haven&apos;t placed camera traps yet. Given the results so far, there could be 20 to 50 tigers here.&quot; The conservation group that provided much of the training and equipment for the operation said the results showed a gap in understanding and the need to invest more in research and protection. Tim Redford of Freeland, a Bangkok-based group that helps rangers in south-east Asia, said: &quot;This place was supposed to be devoid of tigers. But we did a course here and were surprised to find signs of tigers. The more we looked, the more we found. That led me to believe the forest must have tigers throughout and there is a big gap in our knowledge of where they live.&quot; He called for further studies across countries where other small populations may have been missed. The difficulty of measuring tiger numbers was evident when India increased its estimate by 10% compared with a survey in 2008. The discovery comes amid a fresh global push to reverse a precipitous decline in the numbers of wild tigers, down 97% compared with a century ago. At the St Petersburg tiger summit last year, participants, including the World Bank, NGOs and range states, pledged $329m (\u00a3200m) to help double the predators&apos; numbers in the wild from the current level of about 3,200. But the new hope in Thap Lan is mixed with old fears. Thailand is thought to be home to between 250 and 300 wild tigers, but they are vulnerable. The biggest threat is a loss of habitat. Although nominally protected, Thailand&apos;s national parks are being encroached upon by human development, particularly monoculture plantations, roads and second homes for Bangkok&apos;s rich. Many locals also subsidise their incomes by poaching and illegally logging aloe and tropical hardwood. Park managers and police are worried that poachers and illegal traders would target the tigers once news gets out about their numbers in the area. Rangers mount night patrols and public education campaigns to halt these activities. It can be dangerous work. A Thap Lan ranger was killed in a gun battle with poachers three years ago. In Cambodia, forest protectors have been murdered in hand grenade attacks. The stakes are high. According to conservationists and police, poachers are paid 7,000 to 15,000 baht \u2013 \u00a3150 to \u00a3300 \u2013 per kg for a tiger carcass. Middlemen then sell the animals on for about 10 times that amount, mostly to customers in China and Vietnam, where the animal&apos;s bones and penis are used in tonics and aphrodisiacs. Yet penalties for wildlife offences remain absurdly low, with fines ranging from 500 to 40,000 baht. Thailand has much to protect. The country is home to some of the most biodiverse tropical forests in south-east Asia. Just two hours from Bangkok, the Guardian&apos;s car almost ran over a King Cobra, which expressed its indignation by rearing up angrily and flickering its tongue. Despite this ecological wealth, wildlife crime was a low priority for law enforcement authorities for many years. But there are signs that attitudes may be changing. Thai customs officials have made several high-profile arrests in the past two years, including that of a woman who attempted to smuggle a live baby tiger cub through Bangkok airport in a case full of stuffed animal toys. A sting operation last week apprehended a United Arab Emirates citizen whose belongings concealed two leopards, two panthers, an Asiatic black bear and two macaque monkeys. More impressive still was an undercover operation by the Thai police this year that exposed a large tiger-trading syndicate. Its ringleader, a woman known as &quot;J&quot;, remains at large, partly because her husband is a police officer, but investigators said they were closing in. &quot;I believe she may have been selling 100 tigers per year for 10 years,&quot; said Colonel Kittipong Khawsamang, deputy head of the wildlife crime division as he leafed through police photographs of tiger carcasses kept on ice. &quot;We know she is a big trader and have been collecting evidence, but we don&apos;t yet have enough for a prosecution.&quot; Khawsamang said recent raids have shown Thailand has become a hub of the tiger trade, due to its location between other range nations in south-east Asia and China, the main market. The business is also supplied by Thailand&apos;s many tiger farms, some of which claim to operate as zoos while covertly breeding animals for sale. The most notorious is the Sri Racha zoo near Pattaya, which police have raided on several occasions, confiscating hundreds of animals. Tourists still flock to watch the farm-bred tigers jump through flaming hoops, suckle at pigs and walk around on their hind legs to the music of the Can-Can and laughter from the audience. Police and conservationists believe &quot;zoos&quot; encourage poaching both as a source of breeding stock and by sustaining the market for tiger products. General Misakawan Buara, commander of Thailand&apos;s natural resources and environmental crime division, said: &quot;The problem is, we can only check permits and the inventory, but we can&apos;t check which tigers and going in and out because we are police, not animal experts. We need more DNA checks, implanted chips or a tagging system so we can verify the origins of tigers.&quot;That \u2013 like training and equipping rangers \u2013 is not cheap. But little of the money pledged at St Petersberg summit is evident yet at the grass roots, where the budgets for rangers and wildlife police are unchanged &quot;Tiger conservation at the top and the bottom are two different worlds. The people who are high paid researchers and biologists jet-set around the world,&quot; said Freeland&apos;s Redford. &quot;The rangers are paid almost nothing. They get $50 to $200 a month to go out and face armed poachers. We need to give them every support we can if we expect to keep tigers into the future. &quot;There is not a shortage of money, we just have to get it focused in the right places.&quot; Tiger number There are believed to be about 3,200 tigers left in the wild and more than 13,000 in captivity \u2013 half \u00a0of which are\u00a0in\u00a0China. Assessing populations in the wild is notoriously difficult, given the remoteness of the habitat and the animals&apos; tendency to avoid human contact. It is believed numbers have fallen by 97%\u00a0over the past century and the trend remains downwards, but several\u00a0revisions have taken place in recent years. \u2022 In March, India unveiled a new census that put the total number of wild tigers in the country close to 1,550\u00a0\u2013 10% up on 2008. \u2022 In Indonesia, camera traps have recently caught images of 12 Sumatran tigers, including a mother playing with cubs. The WWF estimates there are only 400 Sumatran tigers left in the wild. A recent study conducted by Wildlife Conservation Sociey said the population could be much larger than previously believed. \u2022 About 350 adult Siberian or Amur tigers \u2013 physically, the\u00a0largest subspecies \u2013 are left in the\u00a0wild, with 95% inhabiting\u00a0the far east of Russia. \u2022 Thailand is thought to be home to 250 to 300 wild tigers, though camera traps have revealed that Thaplan National Park has more of the animals than previously\u00a0believed. \u2022 Bangladesh has between 400-450 wild tigers, mostly in\u00a0the Sunderbans mangrove forests which overlap with\u00a0India.\u00a0Last\u00a0year, they killed\u00a044 people.

This question was on my mind as I returned from a reporting trip to Thailand to look at efforts to save the world&apos;s favourite endangered species. Conservationists and law enforcement officers had good news to share in the south-east Asian nation. The Thaplan national park has more tigers than previously believed and police and customs officers have notched up an impressive series of arrests of poachers and smugglers. But they warned that these small gains were overshadowed by the continued presence of large breeding centres, which supply and maintain the illegal market for tiger bones, penises and other products. As is the case with their even bigger counterparts in China, these commercial farms often label themselves conservation zoos even as they lobby for a resumption of the tiger trade. They argue that a legal supply from registered farms could ease the pressure on the wild population. At international conservation meetings, this view is often supported by the same lobby groups that push for a resumption of whaling, the loosening of the ivory trade and the conversion of forests to palm oil production. Higher-minded scientific advocates of captive tiger breeding are driven by a desire to supplement the dwindling wild population, but there has yet to be even one successful reintroduction. Some are motivated by commercial and cultural interests related to the lucrative market for traditional Chinese medicine. Others cite free-market ideology to explain their support of tiger farming and the tiger trade: if an animal is valuable, they say, it will create an incentive to save it. At last year&apos;s tiger summit in St Petersburg, this debate was pushed to the fringes because the farming issue casts China - the main market and breeder - in an unflattering light. But it is increasingly irresponsible to ignore, because the raw numbers suggest tiger commerce has expanded while conservation has declined. Despite the ban on the trade in tigers, the captive population is now four times bigger globally than that in the wild. Partly because of this, a colleague from an Indian newspaper recently suggested to me that the west was too dogmatic in sticking to a conservation approach that seems to have failed. &quot;Why not try breeding and trading?&quot; she said. &quot;Why not leave an Asian animal to Asians?&quot; I put this to the deputy head of Thailand&apos;s wildlife police, Colonel Kittipong Khawsamang. He was adamant that tiger farms were part of the problem rather than the solution, because they encouraged the poaching of wild animals to improve the DNA of their stock. In market terms, it is cost-effective to poach. A tiger brought up in captivity costs its owner a great deal in terms of food and veterinary bills, yet it is worth less than a wild animal, which has greater rarity value and stronger DNA. Steven Galster, the founder of the Bangkok-based conservation group Freeland, says farms maintain a market for tigers and tiger products by illicitly supplying cubs for pets, and bones and penises for traditional medicine. Aside from the economic and legal arguments, there is also the ethical question of how humans should treat animals. At the Sri Racha zoo near Pattaya, cubs paced back and forth in tiny cages and adult tigers leapt through flaming circus hoops and paraded around on two legs to the music of the Can Can. The breeders had ensured the existence of tigers, but at what cost to their essence? Is it too emotional, too western, too dogmatic to ask? How do you distinguish between a conservation zoo and a commercial farm? If the latter are to be closed, what should be done with their tigers? Could you accept mass euthanasia or the enormous cost of looking after more than 10,000 hungry animals for the rest of their lives? Or is it just better to let sleeping captive tigers lie?", "publicationDate": "2011-05-17T10:50:17Z", "tags": ["Conservation", "Wildlife", "Endangered species", "Trees and forests", "Environment", "Animals", "Thailand", "World news", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/may/17/tiger-farms-ban", "title": "Is it time to ban tiger farms? | Jonathan Watts", "sentences": ["Steven Galster, the founder of the Bangkok-based conservation group Freeland, says farms maintain a market for tigers and tiger products by illicitly supplying cubs for pets, and bones and penises for traditional medicine."]}, {"article": "Belize, Central America A stretch of sand, just enough to hide a pirate treasure chest, then a few hundred coconut trees and some wooden cabins \u2013 there isn&apos;t a great deal to Tobacco Caye.

Si Chang is also famous for its incredible seafood and as a bawdy stop-off for merchant sailors \u2013 dozens of their boats are moored just off-shore. Being so close to Bangkok makes Si Chang an intriguing island getaway for couples who&apos;d like an eccentric counterpoint to the Thai capital&apos;s decidedly urban charms. Most accommodation is aimed at Thais - visit ko-sichang.com for an overview. Couples seeking romantic sunsets should try Paree Hut mini-resort (pareehut.com) which has nice bungalows in a quiet location. For great cuisine from north-east Thailand try Pan &amp; David on Asdang Road or local seafood specialists, Lek Naa Wang and No, on the road to the ruined palace. \u2022 Buses leave every 30mins from Bangkok&apos;s Eastern Terminal to Si Racha, where hourly boats run to Si Chang from 7am-7pm. Si Chang&apos;s famous oversized tuk-tuks will greet you on arrival Andrew Spooner St John, US Virgin Islands, Caribbean      Photograph: Andrea Pistolesi    This small, remote island has little room for five-star hotels and the trappings of royal luxury. Small, wildly oscillating roads make large swathes of the island inaccessible for big vision hoteliers, leaving the majority of the coast untouched. Instead, a handful of campsites and stilted treehouses nestle into coves around the island, from the upscale summer camp surrounds of Maho Bay to the pre-pitched tents on the fringes of the national park (which encompasses two thirds of the island) at Cinnamon Bay. Expect an adventure just getting there \u2013 flights from the UK go via New York and Miami to St Thomas, where a ferry transports you to St John, and a shuddering jitney taxi plies the rest of the journey, hurtling down tiny forest roads towards the campsites. \u2022 From US$67 for a platform tent to US$105 per cottage, based on two sharingBenji Lanyado, Guardian travel writer Boracay, the Philippines Boracay is the tropical island 315km south of Manila where the Philippine&apos;s beautiful people come to unwind. It is a picture postcard tropical island \u2013 the sand is powdery white, palm trees paddle their fronds in the clear warm waters, and the pace of life is as chilled as the margarita in your hand. Most people head to the crowded White Beach, the 4km stretch of white sand on the island&apos;s western side, but Bolabog beach on the eastern flank is fantastic for windsurfing. It also has a spooky ghost-white mangrove forest. Pack a picnic and clamber 100m up Mount Luho for stunning views across the island, or catch a paraw (wooden sailboats which let you zip around the island&apos;s coves and reefs) to Balinghai and watch a perfect sunset. Shangri-La spa resort will treat you like royalty, or there&apos;s a relaxed vibe in the numerous bungalows along White Beach (see boracaybeaches.info). To see a more remote side of the Phillipines (there are some 7,000 islands to choose from) the western island group of Palawan, which Filipinos describe as the country&apos;s last frontier, is wonderfully exotic and relatively undiscovered. It&apos;s an archipelago of turquoise sea, jagged limestone islands with underground rivers, virgin rainforest and, of course, immaculate white sandy beaches.\u2022 Trailfinders (0845 050 5892, trailfinders.com) offers seven nights B&amp;B at the Boracay Regency Beach Resort, including one free night, and return flights from Heathrow and boat and road transfers to Boracay, from \u00a31,199.

This former cocoa colony \u2013 for hundreds of years a slaving post between Angola and the Americas \u2013 is today a stunning archipelago of lush forest, sugar loaf mountains and decaying colonial buildings in pastel pink. It was here that the first cocoa boycott was organised by William Cadbury in 1909 due to conditions on the plantations. More Caribbean than African in feel, the country&apos;s watchword is &quot;leve leve&quot; meaning &quot;easy easy&quot;, which is quite right for perhaps the safest and most relaxed country in Africa. \u2022 Five nights at Bom Bom, an islet off the island of Principe, and two nights at Omali Luxury Lodge, including all internal flights and transfers, from \u00a31,421pp with Farside Africa (0131 315 2464, farsideafrica.com).

So the Indigo Bay resort (indigobayresort.com)on Bazaruto island, where we honeymooned last year, offered a winning combination of splendid isolation and 21st century comforts. A 10-minute flight from the Mozambican coast, Bazaruto is 22 miles long and four miles wide, a textbook tropical island of white sand and palm trees encircled by the Indian Ocean. Our chalet opened on to the beach, with an outdoor shower and hammock hitched to a nearby tree, and felt suitably private. But it also offered TV and the chance to wallow in bubbles in a luxury sunken bath. The nearby spa was the pinnacle of pampering with massages, rasul treatments and yoga. A tour of Bazaruto takes a bumpy couple of hours, stopping at lakes to view the crocodiles, or at sand dunes to climb. Other activities include diving and snorkelling, fishing, horse rides and birdwatching. It&apos;s not quite in the stratospheric North Island league but nor is it affordable. Slightly more affordable is White Pearl, a brand new resort on the main island, 100km south of the capital, Maputo. Opening on June 20, it&apos;s all pristine white loungers and rooms painted in cooling shades of pale green and grey.

But now \u2026 well, the hangover has begun. And begun so powerfully, so oppressively, that you might almost suspect the success of the original was created specifically to engender this comedown as a piece of conceptual art. Each reminder of the original, each repetition, each desperate, hair-of-the-dog attempt to recapture the party feeling: it's exactly like living through a hungover flashback-memory of what had once seemed so great. \nIn Hollywood, said William Goldman, nobody knows anything. Who knew The Hangover, from fratpack comedy director Todd Phillips, was going to be such a huge hit? Nobody \u2013 perhaps not even the people involved. The story of a Vegas bachelor party that goes horribly wrong looked pretty ropey on paper, and yet it was great. Some thought it was sort of a monkey-typing-Hamlet fluke, but it's actually the sort of fluke that only happens to smart people who keep trying. \nThe Hangover was funny and the structure was daring. Act one: pre-party \u2013 then we jump straight to act three, post-party, and the movie is about the bleary, amnesiac guys trying to piece together act two: what the hell happened? This is not definitively revealed until the sequence of digital photos over the final credits. Brilliant! It showed the spirit of movies like The Usual Suspects or Reservoir Dogs.Bradley Cooper had the chops \u2013 he had been a forgettable, almost invisible presence in many movies before this, but he blossomed in H1. There were some cracking comedy turns. Zach Galifianakis was great as the weirdo brother-in-law Alan and Ken Jeong was a real find as the abusive comedy gangster Mr Chow. Everything came together. \nSadly, H2 can't even quite claim the credit of being the first Hangover sequel: the road-movie comedy Due Date, directed by Todd Phillips and starring Galifianakis and Robert Downey&nbsp;Jr, attempted to cash in on its success, none too successfully. At least it tried a vaguely different plot. Hangover Part II seeks only to repeat almost every element of the first movie. It's not a sequel, closer to a shot-for-shot remake. This time, the guys go to Thailand for a wedding, in the same shark-jumping way that the Sex and the City girls whooshed off to Abu Dhabi for their profoundly depressing sequel. It feels a bit like a feature-length&nbsp;Christmas special of a well-loved British sitcom. \nThe original's quirks have now become a formula. The grim daytime shots of Vegas at the beginning are now grim daytime shots of Bangkok; the tiger is now a monkey; there's a different sequence of photos over the final credits. Pretty much everything has its equivalent. Infuriatingly, all the fun has been drained from the movie, simply in repeating almost every trick. The same: but lame, and lame because the same. \nNow it's the nerdy dentist Stu (Ed Helms) getting hitched, to a beautiful Thai woman Lauren (Jamie Chung), whose father hates Stu. Slightly insultingly for Justin Barth, his character Doug was the groom-to-be who disappeared in the first movie but he doesn't get a turn at participating in the hi-jinks now. \nStu stays in the story and Barth's nice-but-dull character is sidelined. Stu's goofiness is evidently considered more important to the action, and Phillips perhaps considers that the gang already has a handsome guy in the form of Cooper's Phil. Now it's the bride's sweet younger brother Teddy who tags along on the stag night, disappears, and has to be found at all costs, because he is the apple of his father's eye: he is played by 21-year-old Mason Lee, son of the director Ang Lee. Jeong and Galifianakis seem very subdued and under-par compared to their earlier appearances. \nThen there's the question of the big non-PC cameo to match Mike Tyson's bizarre performance in the original. Rumours have been rife. We had heard about Mel Gibson (that idea was abandoned), Liam Neeson (reportedly cut) and even Bill Clinton. \nActually, Paul Giamatti makes an appearance as a bad-tempered tough guy, but this isn't the big cameo \u2013 that comes in the form of the celebrity booked to sing at Stu's wedding. You may be hoping for Liza Minnelli. Well, no spoilers, but suffice it to say, this too is a bit of a letdown. \nMaking The Hangover Part II must have been like going up to a great guitarist who'd just pulled off a brilliant improvised solo, and telling him he had to repeat the performance the next night, note-for-note. The result is self-conscious to say the least. \nI have to admit that there are one or two nice lines. When the guys gather outside Alan's bedroom, preparing to invite him along, Jeffrey Tambor, playing Alan's father, tells them to \"Go in slowly; let him acclimatise.\" When Stu defiantly claims: \"There's a demon in me!\", Alan hits him with a zinging comeback in the bad-taste spirit of the first film.

Think of Staggered (imminent groom Martin Clunes wakes up naked on a distant Scottish island) and the even less funny Very Bad Things (prostitute accidentally dies as pre-wedding revellers frolic in Las Vegas).

Three chums wake up in Vegas to discover that a trail of terrible mishaps the night before included a run-in with the mob, a marriage, a stolen police car and a missing groom who had to be delivered in Los Angeles the following day.

While my respect for this film or, indeed, any film in which the main characters do karaoke to The Surrey With a Fringe on Top will always be sky high, on this point I have long disagreed with the film&apos;s writer, Nora Ephron. I have plenty of male friends with whom &quot;the sex thing&quot;, as Harry memorably refers to it, has never got in the way, but maybe that&apos;s just because none of them know the lyrics to Oklahoma! But Ephron and I were both wrong: not only can men and women not be friends, they can barely stand to be in the same movie with one another. This summer, ye olde battle of the sexes is being played out in cinemas with The Hangover Part II in one corner, and, for the ladies, Bridesmaids in the other. The Hangover Part II is hilarious only in its disregard for its audience: it is exactly the same as The Hangover, with the only nods to novelty being that Bangkok has been swapped for Vegas, a monkey for a baby and a missing brother-in-law for a missing groom. Bridesmaids opened in the US two weeks ago with heavy responsibility on its taffeta shoulders. &quot;Bridesmaids: Women Can Be Funny Too?&quot; snarked the snarky website Gawker. Happily, Bridesmaids, which is smart and joyful, has proved that having a vagina is no bar to having comic timing. Something, though, is missing from both movies: the other gender. One is almost entirely female and the other \u2013 as is usually the way with American comedies \u2013 is almost entirely male. This is odd in itself (audiences in the 1930s and 40s could cope with Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant snapping out one-liners on the same screen) but it&apos;s the way these movies effect gender segregation that underlines the real problem female comic actors face today. In Bridesmaids, the men are sidelined but have personalities and pose no threat to the bond between the women. In The Hangover Part II, the women have no roles other than the shrewish wife and the hot if silent babe, and only when the men get away from their wives and girlfriends can they be themselves \u2013 which in this film involves (SPOILER ALERT) having sex with a male prostitute. In a gymnastic leap of logic, the movie uses this jaunt as proof that the character is worthy of his bride. Now, to look too closely at the gender politics of The Hangover Part II is to risk getting butterfly fragments in one&apos;s eye as it splits on the wheel. But they do highlight a common trope in American comedies: the adult relationships are not so much husband and wife as Mean Mommy and Infantilised Man Child. Another comedy opened last week in the US that&apos;s weirdly similar to The Hangover Part II in that respect: Woody Allen&apos;s Midnight in Paris. Gil, played by Owen Wilson, is only able to write his novel when he gets away from his horrible fiancee, played by Rachel McAdams. Wilson and McAdams also starred in Wedding Crashers. Midnight in Paris could almost be that film&apos;s sequel as they are playing the same parts: she is the daughter of wealthy parents; he is Owen Wilson. But McAdams has morphed from the sweet thing in Wedding Crashers to the dream-crushing bitch that, according to American comedies, women become once they ensnare their man. Two more films out this summer, Crazy Stupid Love and The Change-Up, are also predicated on the idea that life as a single man is the dream and life as a married man is equivalent to castration. It&apos;s hard to know who should be more insulted by the cliche: women for being portrayed as humourless bitches or men for getting the overgrown baby role. For too long, American comedies have struggled to conceive of a role for women other than soul-sucking wife or smoking hot chick. This is partly because only 17% of directors, producers and writers in Hollywood are women, according to a recent survey, and films that feature women in full possession of a brain are pretty much always written or directed by women. It would be easy to blame Judd Apatow, creator of the bromance genre, for this trope, and some have seen Bridesmaids, which he produced, as his atonement. But Apatow&apos;s biggest success, Knocked Up, emphasised that the misbehaving men are wrong and the complaining wife is totally right. Yet he, like all male comedy writers, reserves the funny lines for the men. &quot;I&apos;m a dude . . . so I lean men, just the way Spike Lee leans African American,&quot; he told the New Yorker. Yet there is another factor and it&apos;s not, contrary to Christopher Hitchens&apos;s claim, that women aren&apos;t funny, but that funny women seem to repel male audiences. Thus, female actors often get shunted into humourless roles. In the same New Yorker article, producer Michael Shamberg said: &quot;If you make a guys&apos; comedy you can get the girls, but if you make a girls&apos; comedy the guys will go, &apos;That&apos;s just chick stuff.&apos;&quot; This is depressingly true. Despite excellent reviews for Bridesmaids, and terrible ones for The Hangover Part II, the former made less than a third of what the latter did in its opening weekend.

Certainly the most miserable times are the most fun to read about it. On a sunny day, you want to hear about someone suffering through the snow and ice. It shows the limits of human endurance. Do you always travel alone? If I want to write, I travel alone. Writing about travel requires both having the experience and having the time to reflect and write. If you&apos;re with someone, they&apos;re saying: &quot;Where are we going to eat? I&apos;m hungry.&quot; Or, &quot;Hey, look at that!&quot; So travelling is best done alone, but a vacation is best shared. Do you get lonely?  Sometimes it&apos;s very tough. But to paraphrase Chekhov, if you&apos;re afraid of loneliness, don&apos;t travel. That solitude is part of travel, and it makes travel happen. You have an experience that you wouldn&apos;t have if you were really happy and sitting in a restaurant. You tend to travel overland. Why do you avoid flying? I would rather do anything than fly. There&apos;s nothing to recommend flying except that it&apos;s quick. You see nothing, you&apos;re hassled, you wait \u2026 Your travel only begins when you get out of the plane. Until then, you&apos;re just in a rocket ship. Do you worry about your carbon footprint? Of course, but there are worse things. Tourism is environmentally destructive \u2013 it&apos;s not just the plane that&apos;s the problem. Companies dig up virgin soil and put up a big hotel, they need a sanitation system, they need water. In a lot of these places the local people have no water, they have no food \u2026 That&apos;s an obvious concern. What are your thoughts about the recent ash cloud? It truly interests me that a volcano 1,000 miles away can create havoc, climate change, close airports, cause breathing problems \u2026 It&apos;s nature&apos;s answer to man&apos;s arrogance: we tamed the planet, but the planet is fighting back. Do you still have a thirst for travel? My thirst has been slaked, but I still have a curiosity. After finishing a novel, other people go out for lunch or see their friends, but I am compelled to go to India or South America. How has travel changed? More people travel, it is cheaper, people are travelling further, and they&apos;re travelling to exotic destinations. Now everyone has been to Bangkok. Once upon a time only the very rich went to Bangkok \u2013 or only the very attractive. One of the paradoxes of travel is that as some countries open up \u2013 Albania, Vietnam, Russia \u2013 others close down. Iran used to be a valid destination. Afghanistan was a place where hippies would go. Tourists were encouraged to go to Libya. It was: &quot;Come to sunny Zimbabwe and look at the giraffes!&quot; It&apos;s strange. You have to seize the opportunity. If it&apos;s possible to go to a place, go there, because something may happen and then you won&apos;t be able to.

For Matt Porsz, the first confrontation came on a Friday night four years ago as he was umpiring a match between McEnroe and his old foe Bjorn Borg before 5,000 fans in an indoor arena in Belfast. &quot;I remember thinking, as I was waiting on court, &apos;they&apos;re actually going to have to listen to what I say,&apos;&quot; he recalls, as if the match had happened only yesterday. &quot;McEnroe was his usual self, he looked like someone who knew he had to do this, there were no pleasantries, whereas Borg came across as nice.&quot; This was not Wimbledon, but an exhibition match between two ageing ex-champions on the veterans&apos; circuit. Yet the man in the chair soon found that McEnroe had lost none of his disdainful attitude towards officials. Sure enough, he felt the lash of the seven-time grand slam singles champion turned TV commentator&apos;s tongue on a disputed point, having overruled a linesman to give Borg a point in the third and final set. &quot;McEnroe thought I&apos;d made the wrong decision and he exploded,&quot; Porsz recalls. &quot;He came marching over to chew me out, he called me the worst umpire ever and wanted to know how much I was getting and why I had overruled a call at this stage of the match.&quot; At the end of the match, which McEnroe won, Borg smiled and shook hands with Porsz, but there was no such gesture from the American. McEnroe was even more bratty the following day, when he played Jeremy Bates, a former British No 1, who was around in the late 1980s and early 1990s. &quot;McEnroe didn&apos;t even want to be there and he was really in a bad mood. He called one line umpire &apos;an effing old man&apos;, then swore at me during a tirade. He said &apos;I don&apos;t want to hear another effing thing out of your mouth except the score.&apos; I gave him a code violation; he had crossed the line and I had to react,&quot; he says. &quot;I got a kick out of that.&quot; Porsz, 28, is a mild-mannered and unassuming character, so it&apos;s hard to imagine him dishing out punishment to a tennis legend such as McEnroe, but it comes with the territory when you sit in that high chair, master of all you survey, and he will be at Wimbledon next week, immaculately turned out in his Ralph Lauren Polo jacket, either as a linesman or chair umpire. Lording it over Borg and McEnroe or umpiring Davis cup ties \u2013 including a five-setter match in Britain&apos;s match with Tunisia \u2013 sounds glamorous, but getting there has been a hard slog. Chair umpiring in the four grand slam tournaments, especially in the latter stages, is a highly sought after affair. There is a strict hierarchy in tennis umpiring, overseen by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), going from white badges, to bronze, silver and finally gold. In the UK there are 20 umpires with white badges, seven bronzes, four silvers and just three golds. Porsz has reached bronze, where more often than not, he will find himself working as a line judge in the later stages of the tournament, at which point the job of chair umpire naturally goes to the more senior officials. With that goal in mind, he has been particularly busy this year, trying to get as many tournaments under his belt in order to build up the experience needed to move through the ranks. This has seen him officiate at events in New Zealand, Thailand, Spain (Barcelona and Madrid), Portugal and France. In the run-up to Wimbledon there was the women&apos;s tournament in Eastbourne last week and the men&apos;s event at Queen&apos;s Club the week before. Advancing a career as a tennis official is a surprisingly tactical business. As Porsz is particularly keen on sitting in the umpire&apos;s chair, he has to pick tournaments where he thinks he will be called upon to act as chair umpire rather than line judge. It&apos;s a bit hit and miss, depending on who&apos;s available, so his strategy is to work the ATP Challenger circuit, where lesser-known players try to break through to the first tier, the ATP World Tour. There isn&apos;t much glamour on the Challenger circuit. Earlier this year, he was in the chair in Bangkok, where the ball boys and girls were street children, and where players&apos; frustrations are never far from the surface. The players do not stay in top-flight hotels and the relatively untrained match staff lack that attention to detail players take for granted in major tournaments \u2013 the ball boys or ball girls won&apos;t necessarily proffer a towel between points, for example. Yet, these events can be the launching pad for the elite tournaments for players and umpires alike. Progress for promising umpires depends on evaluations from other, more senior, officials that are then assessed by the game&apos;s authorities - the ITF, the Association of Tennis Players and the Women&apos;s Tennis Association. For Porsz \u2013 whose father arrived in the UK from Poland after the second world war and whose mother came from Canada \u2013 umpiring grew out of a love of tennis. He started playing at nine and enjoyed it, but realised he would never reach an advanced level. His sister, a successful junior player, went to the US on a sports scholarship and played at college, but the family&apos;s involvement in tennis ended when she gave up. While he studied marketing management at Oxford Brookes University, Porsz decided he wanted a role in tennis, but not as a coach. After reading a feature about jobs in tennis, he wrote off applying for a job as a tennis official. He did not hear back for a while but was eventually invited to a seminar where he and others went through the basic skills, such as calling the ball out. Taken on as a trainee, he umpired his first match about eight years ago \u2013 a north London junior club final when he was paid \u00a320 for the day. Only since the start of this year has Porsz has been able to make a full-time living from tennis umpiring, a job that takes up 25 weeks of the year. Before, he would supplement his tennis earnings by temping in offices and finding jobs through agencies. Now he works at the\u00a0national tennis centre in Roehampton, south-west London, when he is not umpiring. Run by the Lawn Tennis Association, the glitzy, six-year-old complex \u2013 incorporating 22 courts \u2013 is supposed to act as an incubator of future tennis champions. He works in the centre&apos;s competition department, which manages most junior, regional and national competitions, plus British tour, ITF professional circuits and ATP\u00a0challengers. As he shows me around the impressive facilities, some junior players are doing sprint exercises on one of the six indoor acrylic surface courts. On an outside clay court, Pippa Horn, the British under-18 national champion from Norfolk, is practising her serve and hitting ferocious forehands under the gaze of a rather pudgy eastern European coach. Later as we chat outside the centre&apos;s decent canteen, the distinctive twang of Greg Rusedski&apos;s voice is clearly audible from a nearby court, where he is coaching a trio of promising youngsters belting the ball back and forth. Just watching these young players practising gives you a good idea of how hard it can be to track the ball when it flashes by. When I ask Porsz about close calls he has had to make, he mentions a moment in a memorable fourth-round match at the French Open two years ago, in which Sweden&apos;s Robin Soderling astounded the tennis world by beating Spain&apos;s Rafael Nadal, a player who had previously seemed unassailable on the red clay courts of Roland Garros. &quot;I was the left baseline judge,&quot; he recalls. &quot;Soderling hit the ball a fraction out after a long rally and I belted out a loud call. You have to sell it well and I was pleased that I had got it right, as you could see the mark it had left.&quot; Although the Soderling-Nadal clash was a great match from a spectator&apos;s point of view (and tennis fans may envy Porsz for being so close to the action), he points out that umpires are too busy concentrating on their jobs to appreciate the spectacle. &quot;Lots of people say you have the best view in the house,&quot; says Porsz, &quot;but when you&apos;re officiating you don&apos;t really appreciate the match itself. You really have to stay focused, be aware of\u00a0what&apos;s going on, where the ball boys\u00a0or girls are. You&apos;re there to do a job and you are aware that your decisions can affect a match. On the big points you&apos;ve got to concentrate even more. You get the sense of the quality of the match through the reaction of the crowd.&quot; Assuming he makes it into the umpire&apos;s chair, though, one thing he will always have is the final say. Does he ever feel the pressure of making a\u00a0bad call when so much is at stake for\u00a0the players? On that score, interestingly, his views are as black and white as McEnroe&apos;s. &quot;If a player loses, it&apos;s the player,&quot; he shrugs. &quot;It&apos;s not the\u00a0umpire.&quot; Curriculum vitae Pay Ranges from \u00a3250 to \u00a3950 a week for chair umpiring, the higher end depending on if you are a &quot;designated official&quot; (one of the main umpires). Hours At a qualifying match, he can be done by 10.30am. On other days, he can be at a tournament all day. Work-life balance &quot;The time on site can be long. We may only do one or two matches, but there can be a lot of waiting around. We can also be on standby in case a replacement chair umpire is needed. If I finish at a decent time I try and make the most of the evening, especially in a city with lots to see.&quot; Best thing On court for a big match with a large crowd. &quot;The adrenaline flows and you get energy from everything around you. Also travelling round the world, submerging yourself in different cultures.&quot; Worst thing &quot;Missing out on a home life and not being there for close friends&apos; birthdays. And I was stuck at Madrid airport for eight hours earlier this year, but haven&apos;t lost my luggage yet, probably one of the few tennis officials not to, so far.&quot; Overtime Matt likes playing other sports including five-a-side football and cricket on Clapham Common. Since moving to London four years ago he has also tried bikram yoga (a\u00a0form of yoga that is performed in what feels like a large sauna), and taken part in some long cycle rides, including the London to Brighton bike ride last summer. &quot;Next month I will be boarding a London rib with my sister.

She would be the first woman to hold the post in Bangkok, though not the first member of her family. Brother Thaksin is in exile in Dubai. You may not be a student of Thai politics, a dozen military coups in eight decades and huge unrest since the ousting of Thaksin, who presented himself, so Tania Branigan points out, as a champion of the rural underclass, not the corrupt authoritarian plutocrat seen by his enemies. But Sunday&apos;s election in Thailand does have wider resonance in gender politics. The Guardian&apos;s Zoe Williams frets in her column today about Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister getting Dominique Strauss-Kahn&apos;s job at the IMF. She suspects Lagarde is &quot;the Beyonc\u00e9 of international finance&quot; \u2013 by which I think Zoe means she&apos;s a Tory \u2013 though she comes to the sensible conclusion that women have as much right to be as varied, idiotic and selfish in their politics as blokes can be and that the presence of women in politics can (and do) achieve a lot of low profile cross-party good for women&apos;s issues. I&apos;m sure that&apos;s right. All the same it&apos;s fascinating to watch. Thais hope/fear that sister Yingluck will pardon brother Thaksin and bring him home where his entourage is already providing much of her advice within the Pheu Thai party. Yep, that sounds likely. She is &quot;not my nominee but my clone&quot;, says Thaksin. Cast you mind back to the splendidly-named Laura Chinchilla&apos;s victory, a landslide in February, to become first elected woman president of tiny Costa Rica, Panama&apos;s neighbour and long the most decent of the central American micro-republics. As Rory Carroll noted at the time: &quot;She followed Argentina&apos;s Cristina Kirchner, elected in 2007, Chile&apos;s Michelle Bachelet, elected in 2006, Panama&apos;s Mireya Moscoso, elected in 1999, and Nicaragua&apos;s Violeta Chamorro, elected in 1990.&quot; And, of course, the biggest of them all, Dilma Rousseff, got elected president of Brazil in January, an ex-leftwing guerilla from a wealthy background. She is protege of the trade union president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva just as Chinchilla was promoted by \u00d3scar Arias, the ex-president whose receipt of the Nobel peace prize (for helping reconcile Nicaragua and El Salvador) was announced the very day I flew into his capital, San Juan. A lot of cars horns were being blown. Every case is different. Chamorro&apos;s husband was a prominent anti-Sandinista newspaper owner, murdered in 1978, when she stepped into the breach. Argentina&apos;s Kirchner is a former first lady whose husband, Nestor \u2013 he died last year \u2013 was routinely accused of pulling the strings. At least in Argentina that card can be played both ways since Evita Per\u00f3n \u2013 of musical fame \u2014 used to be regarded as the brains behind her husband, Juan. So everywhere \u2013 from Iceland to conservative Switzerland, where they have had two elected women presidents despite only getting the vote in 1971 \u2013 the case is different; some women running on their husbands/brother&apos;s reputation, a barely disguised surrogate, others doing it by talent, judgment and good luck: dynasty v meritocracy, as usual. This is surely most striking in south and east Asia where \u2013 in highly conservative Muslim countries like Pakistan, less so Bangladesh or Indonesia \u2013 women have been prime minister. India, Sri Lanka \u2013 now perhaps Thailand \u2013 and of course Cory Aquino  (another political martyr&apos;s widow) won the disputed battle against Ferdinand Marcos, old and corrupt, in 1986. I was there for that one too. But Asia&apos;s gender politics tend to be dynastic. Women leaders are usually related to male politicians, they are part of the family. When I recently discussed women in Chinese politics with a chum in Beijing I was told they have not cracked the bamboo ceiling \u2013 do we count Madame Mao or Madame Chiang Kai Shek? \u2013 though some Chinese women have done VERY well in business. Why? Because business often equals family and people are used to women running family businesses in China and the wider diaspora. But remember, Mike, a lot of Chinese baby girls still get aborted and it&apos;s OK to advertise for pretty women of 25 (and even specify bra cup size) in the jobs market. Still a long way to go then. I can&apos;t see much of a downside in Lagarde&apos;s promotion. Apart from the obvious fact that she&apos;s unlikely to harass chambermaids (alleged) she&apos;s clearly smart and an Anglophone who is well travelled and thus a broader\u2013minded representative of the French than many. OK, so she&apos;s a Tory, but also a meritocrat. Strauss-Kahn&apos;s lifestyle was, I suspect, rather grander and less democratic. She will misbehave in her own way. Watch out, Greeks! Yet the odd thing is that in the mature democracies of the west you can spot dynasticism mingling with the meritocracy, more than one would have predicted when universal suffrage emerged a century ago. Such as? Well, there&apos;s Marine Le Pen, daughter of Jean Marie, running for president of France next year and \u2013 a bit more reluctantly \u2013 Martine Aubry, whose dad, Jacques Delors, used to frighten British Tories as the only charismatic European politician they&apos;d heard of. Anywhere else? Well, the Mussolinis seem to have gone quiet in Italy, though Silvio Berlusconi&apos;s sense of sexual rectitude is so great that it&apos;s safe for one of his daughters to be around to advise him. There&apos;s Hillary Clinton, of course \u2013 her husband would have pulled strong too, they claimed, though I doubt he&apos;d have got too far. Even here, didn&apos;t Jim Callaghan&apos;s daughter, Margaret (Lady Jay) end up in the Blair cabinet? She did. There have been plenty of wives and daughters in the Commons in my time \u2013 though also sons: think four generations of Benns. And perhaps that&apos;s the point. Dynasticism in the Republic of Ireland is so pronounced that at the March elections this year the newspapers published family trees to show how seats were handed down from generation to generation just like the rotten boroughs of old England. How can that happen under the saintly single transferable vote (STV), I hear you ask. Don&apos;t get me started. I happen to have been reading Claire Tomalin&apos;s tremendous 1974 biography of Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-1797) whose life is an extraordinary saga of courage, disappointment (inevitably she fell badly for a cad) and determination. Would the author of the Vindication of the Rights of Women been impressed with the progress she would have found today? You bet she would, though she would probably have wanted to dash off to Paris \u2013 as she so boldly did in the dangerous year of 1793 \u2013 to give Lagarde a general hangbagging over cuts and how they affect women&apos;s lives. But Mary \u2013 as I now think of her \u2013 would not have left Margaret Thatcher, Tory or no, off an official government list of high-achieving British women, as Harriet Harman did in office. Naughty Hattie. But as Zoe Williams says women behaving badly is their right as it is the blokes&apos;. There&apos;s a TV sit-com in that.

Two other young Britons survived the head-on collision with another bus in the early hours near the town of Khlong Khlung on an overnight journey to Chiang Mai, a favourite stop on the &quot;gappers&quot; trail through south-east Asia. The victims were all 19 and were named as Bruno Melling-Firth, Conrad Quashie and Max Boomgaarden-Cook. They had been travelling together. A fourth friend who was unharmed has arrived back in the UK, while the other injured student is in hospital in Bangkok with back injuries. The trio were taking advantage of what is expected to be the last big gap year before rises in student fees transform the finances of higher education in the UK. Their devastated families said the teenagers were bright and full of happiness, plans and hope \u2013 the collapse of which was almost unbearable. Boomgaarden-Cook, who volunteered regularly for a leukaemia charity, had gained straight As at A-level to win a place at Manchester University and was working on ideas for a book about the second world war. The day before the crash, he had emailed his family in London with a high-spirited account of his adventures, ending the messages with 10 kisses. His father, Gerhard Boomgaarden, a 48-year-old publisher from Herne Hill in south London, said the school friends had saved for months for the nine-week trip from Bangkok to Vietnam and Indonesia. He said: &quot;They had only been gone for a few days. They left Heathrow last Thursday. Max had been planning it for ages. A\u00a0few years ago he said to me: &apos;Dad, before I am 20 I will have travelled around south-east Asia.&apos; It was a dream of his. &quot;I never dreamt he would be coming back in a metal container. The one consolation is that I understand their deaths were instantaneous. The force of the collision meant they did not suffer.&quot; He added: &quot;We are all in a state of shock. Just the day before the accident I had received an email from Max and he said they were all having a wonderful time, and how much he loved me. &quot;I did not know human bodies could produce so many tears. It is such an intense pain that will never go away. He was just about to go off and do his own thing.&quot; Boomgaarden said the loss of Max, who was friends with the others in the group at Charter school in Dulwich, south London, had left his mother, Polly Cook, so upset that she could barely talk. The teenager&apos;s stepmother, Madeleine, his 16- and six-year-old brothers, Leo and Ivan, and his 13-year-old stepbrother, Leon, were all very close and are distraught.

We are happy to clarify that during Shathri&apos;s interview with the Guardian in 2011, there was no discussion of KAUST or of the Saudi Arabian royal family and Shathri was not critical of them. See Sheikh Saad bin Nasser Al Shathri -v- Guardian News &amp; Media Limited for a more detailed statement.&quot; On a Friday at one o&apos;clock, Sheikh Saad bin Nasser Al Shathri is leading prayers in a small mosque in an upmarket neighbourhood of Riyadh, the Saudi capital. The faithful fill two floors, listening to the cleric&apos;s sermon on the true sense of the traditional greeting &quot;salaam aleikum&quot; \u2013 peace be upon you. This, Shathri says, means love thy neighbour. It is a moderate message from a man who even in fiercely conservative Saudi Arabia, home to the most rigorous strands of Muslim practice in the world, is considered a hardliner. Only 18 months ago, Shathri, 46, was fired from the country&apos;s high council of religious scholars by King Abdullah, who has ruled the kingdom since 2005. His offence was to have criticised the king&apos;s decision to allow male and female researchers to work together at the new multibillion pound science university built on the Red Sea coast. The king had called the university, a key part of Saudi Arabia&apos;s drive towards economic modernisation, a &quot;beacon of tolerance&quot;. Shathri retorted that &quot;mixing [genders] is a great sin and a great evil ... When men mix with women, their hearts burn and they will be diverted from their main goal [of] education.&quot; Shathri remains unrepentant. In an interview with the Guardian, his first with a western newspaper, he says the duty of religious scholars is to advise sovereign rulers but also &quot;to make governors fear God if they err from the right path and to remind them of God&apos;s punishment if they continue to err&quot;. In an implicit criticism of the hugely wealthy royal family, Shathri said the Qur&apos;an teaches money should not be admired nor should the rich be envied. The poorer you are, he said, &quot;the less you will have to account for in this life and the next&quot;. Such tensions between the descendants of Abdul Aziz ibn Saud, the tribal chieftain who unified the warring states of the Arabian peninsula to form Saudi Arabia in 1932, and the country&apos;s clerics are not new. Having used fanatical Wahhabi religious fighters to conquer his new kingdom, Saud crushed their subsequent revolt and did a deal with the country&apos;s ultra-conservative clergy that has endured to this day. The religious establishment was allowed substantial independence, the control of key ministries and a share of the wealth of the kingdom. In return, in crisis after crisis, it has come to the aid of the family, buttressing its authority with fatwa \u2013 religious opinions. So in 1991, clerics declared US troops could be based in the kingdom. After the 9/11 attacks, in which 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis, religious scholars in the kingdom repudiated al-Qaida&apos;s extremism, grudgingly accepted some changes to schoolbooks that encouraged intolerance, and co-operated in restricting the flow of money from Saudi Arabia to radical organisations. This year, as demonstrations unseated leaders in Tunisia and Egypt and threatened many more, they told the faithful that protests against their rulers would be un-Islamic. &quot;Relations between the royal family and the clergy are very good,&quot; says Turki al-Sudeiri, editor of the loyalist al&apos;Riyadh newspaper. But such support is often grudging. Shathri is not the only cleric to dislike the current king&apos;s moves towards incremental reform. The most conservative part of Saudi Arabia is al-Qassim province, a 250-mile drive west across the desert plateau from the capital. Cities here have seen repeated challenges to the authority of the Saud family. There were riots when women&apos;s education was introduced in the 1960s and in the 1990s the province was a base for the &quot;awakening&quot; movement of radical clerics who inspired and influenced Osama bin Laden. Here both the house of al-Saud and establishment clerics close to the current king are seen with unspoken suspicion. From al-Qassim, &quot;Riyadh looks like Paris and [the relatively tolerant port city of] Jeddah looks like Bangkok,&quot; says one Saudi reformer. But there is variety in even al-Qassim&apos;s conservatism. Ibrahim al-Duwaish runs a social science institute in the small town of Ar Rass. The 41-year-old religious scholar uses an iPhone and says he enjoyed his time in the UK last year, where he admired the orderly traffic and numerous universities \u2013 although not public drunkenness at weekends. Once a firebrand reactionary and now seen locally as a relative moderate, he says there is nothing wrong with women driving in theory but that he opposed it in practice because women taking to the road would cause too many accidents. Equally, Duwaish welcomed the change new communications technology has brought to the kingdom as the internet means he can employ women at his institute. They are able to work from home and still avoid contact with men who are not their husbands or immediate family, he says. &quot;If you ask women all over the world if they prefer a mixed environment or to be away from men, they would choose the latter,&quot; Duwaish, whose centre was one of the first to publish a report on domestic violence in the kingdom, told the Guardian. As elsewhere in Saudi Arabia, Ar Rass has changed immensely since Duwaish was a child. The last four decades here have seen a huge transfer of population from the countryside to small towns and into cities, a leap in material comfort and the demolition of almost every building that pre-dated the vast oil wealth of the 1970s. Forty years ago most women and many men could not read. But there is nostalgia for times past. Ar Rass was a &quot;quiet town where everybody knew each other&quot;, Duwaish, remembers. &quot;It was so pure, so quiet.&quot; The growing number of heritage projects in Saudi Arabia indicates such sentiments are widespread. The Ar Rass municipality recently opened a &quot;traditional&quot; museum in the corner of a shopping mall where a former soldier wears traditional dress and makes old-fashioned coffee for visitors who sit on rugs. More than 80 visitors come every day,mainly young people curious about their heritage. The museum is a good initiative, said Duwaish, the cleric, because &quot;when traditions disappear overnight, people react badly&quot;. One such reaction in recent decades has been violent extremism. Saudi Arabia was hit by a series of al-Qaida-inspired attacks between 2003 and 2004, prompting widespread reform of the security services and hundreds of people being rounded up. Some of those responsible were veterans of militant training camps in Afghanistan, others were new recruits. Recent years have been calm, however. &quot;The problem has now almost disappeared,&quot; said Abdulrahman al-Hadlaq, a Ministry of Interior criminologist who works on radical Islam in the kingdom. &quot;Al-Qaida here is dying. Public awareness is much higher, security is stricter.&quot; More than 10,000 people have been arrested on terrorism charges, sometimes on flimsy evidence, human rights campaigners say. Many senior extremists have fled to Yemen. Last week, the trial of alleged militants accused of an assault on a housing compound full of expatriates in 2003 started. Dozens of death sentences are expected. Less serious offenders are dealt with more leniently. Hadlaq runs a team of counsellors, psychologists and clerics who work to rehabilitate former militants at a centre on the outskirts of Riyadh. Since it opened in 2007, hundreds of recently released prisoners, all convicted for militant activity, have &quot;graduated&quot;. Recidivism rates, Hadlaq said, were around 10% for those involved in support activities or who had travelled to Iraq to fight American troops there but approached 25% for the 123 Saudi citizens who had been incarcerated in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Many of these &quot;Gitmo veterans&quot; now head the Ministry of Interior&apos;s wanted list, according to General Mansour al&apos;Turki, a senior official. Several are now leaders of the &quot;al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula&quot; group, based in Yemen. Yusef al&apos;Rabesh, 32, is one &quot;Gitmo veteran&quot; who has been successfully &quot;rehabilitated&quot;, however. Detained like many others by American troops in Afghanistan in late 2001, he spent seven years in US custody before being released without charge. Rabesh claims he was in Afghanistan looking for his brother, a Taliban fighter. American military authorities said he was a trained combatant. In detention in Afghanistan and then in Cuba, &quot;the [Americans] hit me, dragged me, chained me like a dog&quot;, Rabesh said. &quot;We were treated worse than animals. But the rehabilitation programme took this black experience away.&quot; On his release, the government found Rabesh a job as a manager in a taxi company, a wife in his hometown of Burayda in al-Qassim province and provided tens of thousands of dollars for the wedding. He now &quot;better understands Islam&quot;, he says. &quot;There are legitimate reasons for jihad in our religion but I have learned that no private person can say that a jihad is justified. It can only be the Islamic scholars who make that decision according to certain conditions,&quot; he said. Last week, Prince Nayef, the most conservative of senior princes and minister of interior, told a local audience that terrorism had &quot;wronged many, damaging the image of Islam, the Arabs and in particular the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.&quot; Nayef is head of the religious police who continue to enforce, even if less brutally and intrusively than previously, Saudi Arabia&apos;s fierce puritanism and is known to be opposed to any major social reforms in the country. The erosion of Saudi Arabia&apos;s deep conservatism is a reality but is neither a uniform nor linear process. It is extremely unlikely even the more moderate elements within the royal family will seek to accelerate the pace of reform and risk alienating the clerical establishment. Should Prince Nayef succeed \u2013 he is currently 76, second in line to the throne and eleven years younger than the king \u2013 most analysts expect a new reactionary atmosphere. Many Saudis will be pleased. &quot;You have democracy. We have our religion,&quot; said Abdallah al&apos;Utaiba, 32, a camel dealer who listened to the news of the Arab spring uprisings on a radio in a tent in the dusty hinterland on the fringes of Riyadh. &quot;You have lost your traditions.

Somrith Sanbradap&apos;s house was completed just two days ago, but she shows no sign of pleasure in the achievement. The Thai farmer&apos;s last home went up in flames in February, destroyed by Cambodian shelling as a long dispute over Preah Vihear \u2013 the 11th-century temple a few kilometres away \u2013 flared up again. At least seven people died and thousands fled homes on both sides of the border. Now residents fear another clash is imminent. &quot;I lost everything \u2026 I don&apos;t want this to happen again and the way things are going now, watching the news brings back very bad memories,&quot; Somrith said tearfully. This week, the Thai military said Cambodia was moving in reinforcements \u2013 a claim denied by Phnom Penh \u2013 after Bangkok announced it was leaving the World Heritage Convention over the dispute. But analysts believe the row is driven by Sunday&apos;s general election in Thailand. &quot;In this very critical week for Thai politics, [the temple dispute] has appeared again as a political weapon,&quot; said Dr Pavin Chachavalpongpun of the Institute of South-East Asian Studies in Singapore. He said that while the government&apos;s stance would not win over opponents, it had rallied nationalist sympathisers who had drifted away. The incumbent Democrats are trailing Puea Thai in the polls. The prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, said the decision to leave the convention was solely about defending Thai land, the Nation newspaper reported. He added: &quot;I want the voters to choose the Democrats as we protect the territory, although it is against the wishes of a leader in a neighbouring country.&quot; Abhisit said the Cambodian leader, Hun Sen, wanted a new Thai government because of his ties to exiled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The opposition Puea Thai party is headed by Thaksin&apos;s sister and regarded as his proxy. The temple, known as Phra Viharn to Thais, stands high on an escarpment in the Dangrek mountains. Originally a Hindu place of worship it was later used by Buddhists. Bangkok does not dispute a 1962 international court of justice ruling that it belongs to Cambodia, but still claims a 4.6sq km area of land around the site. In 2008 rightwing Thai nationalists reacted angrily when Unesco granted the site world heritage status, although Bangkok had not opposed Cambodia&apos;s application. The Democrats \u2013 then in opposition \u2013 took an increasingly hawkish line. While no one expects large scale military action, clashes in the last three years have affected bilateral relations, caused deaths and evacuations and damaged Preah Vihear itself. Prof Charnvit Kasetsiri, a historian and former rector of Bangkok&apos;s Thammasat University, warned that the row and the decision to quit the World Heritage Convention were affecting Thailand&apos;s standing. &quot;It has damaged our reputation internationally \u2013 we look like the bad guys to the world,&quot; he said. The Thai military says it will not instigate hostilities \u2013 each side blamed the other for February&apos;s skirmish \u2013 and now seems to be playing down its comments about Cambodian reinforcements on the other side of the border. &quot;I&apos;m not scared, because we&apos;re well prepared,&quot; said a soldier guarding a sandbagged checkpoint at what used to be the ticket booth for the Thai national park leading to the temple. That is as far as one can go \u2013 a source of regret to Warunrat Chitruchiphong, a regular visitor since her teenage years. &quot;It&apos;s magnificent. I want to go back,&quot; she said. The 34-year-old teacher&apos;s bigger concern is the safety of her pupils. The Phumsaron Wittaya high school was in the middle of a sports day when fighting broke out in February; shells hit the buildings as the frightened staff and pupils crouched in concrete bunkers built the previous year. &quot;I&apos;m constantly worried that if something happens we won&apos;t get them into their bunkers in time,&quot; said Warunrat. &quot;I&apos;m very nervous, but what can we do?&quot;Pavin said he did not expect to see violence this week or next. But in the longer term, he warned, it depended on the election&apos;s outcome.&quot;If Puea Thai come back, the issue could be used once again to discredit the red shirts.

They tied scarlet thread around neighbours&apos; wrists, put up flags along the roadside and erected a metal sign declaring their new status. &quot;It&apos;s a red district anyway. The point is the symbolism,&quot; said Kwanchai Praipana, a prominent redshirt leader from Thailand&apos;s Udon Thani province. &quot;The aim is to show we want justice, democracy and Thaksin [Shinawatra] to return.&quot; Hundreds of north-eastern settlements have proclaimed themselves &quot;red democracy villages&quot; since today&apos;s general election was announced, in the latest evolution of the anti-government redshirt movement. It highlights a bitter division that claimed more than 90 lives last year and is focused on one man: the former prime minister, whose beaming face adorns Suk Somboon&apos;s new sign. Thaksin Shinawatra \u2013 who was the owner of Manchester City FC for 15 months from June 2007 \u2013 defines Thai politics even from 3,000 miles away in Dubai, where he lives to avoid a jail sentence for abuse of power. The redshirt-associated party Puea Thai \u2013 led by his sister Yingluck, but Thaksin&apos;s in all but name \u2013 is on course to beat the incumbent Democrats. Jon Ungpakhorn, an activist and former senator, warned last week: &quot;There is a clear danger of violence on a scale closer to civil war if either side is provoked by extreme measures \u2013 for example, if a Puea Thai election victory were to be derailed by a legal judgment or military coup, or if a Puea Thai government were to swiftly facilitate the return of a defiant Thaksin Shinawatra by means of amnesty and pardon.&quot; Prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, arriving for his party&apos;s final, rain-drenched rally on Friday, said: &quot;The core issue is whether the Thai people want to move the country forward beyond the conflict created by and surrounding one man.&quot; But Professor Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University, suggested that the underlying issue was the awakening of a marginalised grassroots electorate that is challenging the political status quo. Thaksin, a former telecoms tycoon who recently told Der Spiegel he had &quot;barely a billion&quot; left, might not seem an\u00a0obvious figurehead for such a movement. But Thitinan described him as &quot;an agent and catalyst for this newly emergent Thailand&quot;, adding: &quot;He does not see it that way \u2013 he sees it as all about him. On\u00a0the one hand, it&apos;s Thaksin manipulating and exploiting the forces he unleashed. On the other hand, his adversaries deny these voices because they don&apos;t want to confront them. They say these people are not educated, or are misguided, or that Thaksin has paid them. But these are the people who will ultimately determine Thailand&apos;s political direction.&quot; The Democrats draw support mainly from the south and from the urban middle class, while the pro-Thaksin movement relies on lower-income workers in the north and north east. Analysts suggest social changes, such as increased migration and improved communications, have raised expectations and access to information and reduced deference. &quot;Five years ago politics was only discussed by the middle and upper classes. Now poor and rural people have become interested and involved,&quot; said redshirt trade unionist Jittra Cotchadet. Puea Thai&apos;s promises are expensive and at times clearly rhetorical; they include the eradication of poverty within four years. But, in Suk Somboon, villagers say Thaksin delivered on the affordable healthcare and cheap credit pledges that won two electoral landslides. &quot;Thaksin said he would give villagers money, and he did,&quot; said 63-year-old Naichu Kamala. &quot;I don&apos;t care if he is corrupt. All politicians in Thailand are, but Thaksin gives money to the poor.&quot; Though the Democrats are now seeking to woo the same voters, Thitinan argued that they miss the point even when aping popular Thaksin policies; they still see politics as a top-down process. &quot;They pitched it as welfare. People don&apos;t want welfare; they want opportunities and that&apos;s how they see it with Thaksin - it&apos;s about hopes and dreams,&quot; he said. But the billionaire was toppled in a military coup in 2006 amid growing concern about corruption and increasing authoritarianism. Supporters like Kwanchai say blame his ousting and conviction on jealous elites. Others say there was real cause for alarm. &quot;Thaksin as prime minister showed contempt for the due process of law, human rights and checks and balances,&quot; said Sunai Phasuk of Human Rights Watch, citing mass extrajudicial killings in a &quot;war on drugs&quot; and the use of excessive force in restive Southern province. &quot;The problem with human rights in Thailand started well before the coup, but the coup made it worse.&quot; Thaksin&apos;s Thai Rak Thai party was disbanded, as was its next incarnation; Abhisit came to power in a parliamentary deal. After Thaksin&apos;s supporters regrouped as the redshirts and moved onto the streets, occupying a central area of Bangkok last year, a military crackdown led to dozens of deaths. Observers say both sides have failed to acknowledge their responsibility for violence. But while redshirt leaders were jailed for their involvement, there has been no official admission that the army killed or injured demonstrators - fuelling popular anger. Finance minister Korn Chatikavanij suggested on Friday that the election was in itself a sign of progress. &quot;A year ago we were on the verge of civil war,&quot; he said. &quot;Tonight there are two major rallies in two corners of Bangkok by the two major parties. We have every reason to be optimistic.&quot; Others expect further turmoil this year if, as predicted, Puea Thai win most seats tonight but not an outright majority. &quot;The rise of the PAD [the conservative pro-royalists whose protests helped to topple Thaksin, and prompted the creation of the redshirts] gave birth to violent mob rule in Thailand - the belief that might is right and that if you have grievances anything is permissible,&quot; said Sunai of Human Rights Watch. Redshirt leaders are already threatening protests if it does not form the next government, though political manoeuvring could take months to play out. &quot;I don&apos;t believe any other government will help our people,&quot; said 28-year-old Pradit Pimdee in Suk Somboon. &quot;If Yingluck does not become prime minister, people will be very angry...If the village head tells us to go to Bangkok, I will definitely go.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-07-02T23:04:00Z", "tags": ["Thaksin Shinawatra", "Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/03/thaksin-shinawatra-thailand", "title": "Thailand's redshirts prepare for another poll victory", "sentences": ["After Thaksin&apos;s supporters regrouped as the redshirts and moved onto the streets, occupying a central area of Bangkok last year, a military crackdown led to dozens of deaths.", "&quot;Tonight there are two major rallies in two corners of Bangkok by the two major parties.", "&quot;If Yingluck does not become prime minister, people will be very angry...If the village head tells us to go to Bangkok, I will definitely go.&quot;"]}, {"article": "37 Hoxton Square, London N1 (020 7739 8316). Meal for two, including wine and service, \u00a375 I went to the Red Dog Saloon in London&apos;s Hoxton, sodden with a hope that I would be served meats properly barbecued in the Southern US style. In the end the only thing that was scorched was the reputation of the people running it. I am no stranger to this experience. Adam Perry Lang and Jamie Oliver&apos;s Barbecoa was a lot of the same promises cruelly broken. Likewise there has been a lot of talk recently about the Pitt Cue Company, a mobile food truck currently parked under Hungerford Bridge on the South Bank of the Thames which is also claiming to do US barbecue. Except on the day I visited all they had was pulled pork and smoked brisket \u2013 very good in themselves, but not the carnivorous pull and tug of a solid rib. Their ribs weren&apos;t ready and wouldn&apos;t be for hours. They had capacity problems, they said. This would, eventually, all start to sound weirdly familiar. Certainly it should have been proof, if proof were needed, that there are certain things \u2013 the Swiss sense of humour, Bangkok bar acts, Southern US barbecue \u2013 that do not travel. Ah, but greed springs eternal. The Red Dog Saloon sounded right and they had been working very hard to reassure the Twittersphere that they meant business. The dining room, previously a Japanese restaurant which I&apos;m sure I once reviewed but cannot for the life of me now remember, is not unattractive: a lot of wood, and booths with leather banquettes. There is French&apos;s mustard on the tables and ketchup and napkins. No sticky-labelled bottles of barbecue sauce, but we decide to let that pass. What we can&apos;t let pass is the menu. They have Buffalo chicken wings. They have a few sandwiches and lots of burgers. They have no ribs. We call over a waiter. Don&apos;t you have any ribs? Sadly not, he says. We don&apos;t have them until later in the afternoon. I stare at him. Let me get this straight: you&apos;re a barbecue restaurant with no barbecue? He gives me the sad, would-that-it-were-other face again. There isn&apos;t space in their smoker to produce enough for both lunch and dinner. We had phoned ahead and they had never mentioned this. A quick huddle and the staff announce they can rustle up some ribs in 20 minutes if we get going on the starters. That&apos;s fine by us. We order Buffalo chicken wings. They are raw at the middle. We send them back. The second lot are cooked through and are better than any Buffalo wings I&apos;ve had in London. The skin is crisp in the Southern fried style. The hot sauce glaze is balanced and salty and forces you to lick your lips. Other dishes are great, too. Mac and cheese could do with being a little more burnished on top but has crisp bits of bacon buried in the properly cheesy B\u00e9chamel, and I&apos;m not about to kick something like that out of bed. We like the beans, into which have been dropped fragments of leftover pig. Coney Island fries hide under an outrageous landslide of cheese and chilli. There is even promise in the ribs. We like the sweet dark-caramel crunch on the outside of the beef short ribs, and the pork options aren&apos;t bad either. They&apos;re not the baby backs that their online menu promised; they weren&apos;t happy with the suppliers, apparently. They are the bigger spares, and better for being a little chunkier, although \u00a312.50 for just two is not what anybody would call a bargain. More importantly, though, both are dry and tired. Then it dawns on me. The only way they could have gone from not having ribs to having ribs served at this tepid temperature is if these were yesterday&apos;s. The owner confirms, apologetically, that this is the case. But, he says, he is committed to getting it right, tells us that he loves Southern barbecue and that he was taught everything he knows by a famous British barbecue champion. Great, says my companion, who knows a bit about the subject&apos; too. And where in the US did you do your research? Kansas? Texas? The Carolinas? Oh, I&apos;ve never been to the US, he says. Up to that point I had a bit of sympathy for them. It might have been a disastrous meal, but they had been trying to sort things and it was early days. Some of the food is good. The operation has heart. Now all that fellow feeling drained away. They&apos;ve spent significant sums setting the place up. They&apos;ve refitted the restaurant, brought in smokers, hired staff. And at no point did they think a couple of grand spent on a road trip to the Southern US, during which they might have rumbled the smoker capacity problem, was a good idea? That would have been a very good use of their time. Instead a visit to the Red Dog Saloon turned out to be a total waste of mine.

Although his younger sister formally leads the Puea Thai party, she is regarded as his proxy. Yingluck, a 44-year-old businesswoman who entered politics just six weeks ago, said: &quot;I don&apos;t want to say that Puea Thai wins today. It&apos;s a victory of the people.&quot; The election commission&apos;s preliminary results suggest Puea Thai will take 261 seats in the 500-seat parliament, with the Democrats winning just 162. Hundreds of red-shirted supporters flocked to the party&apos;s Bangkok headquarters, chanting, cheering and applauding as results came in. Many waved pictures of Yingluck and Thaksin and some let off firecrackers to celebrate. Moments before Yingluck spoke, the defeated prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, congratulated the opposition and said he wanted to see unity and reconciliation. Somjai Phagaphasvivat, a political scientist at Thammasat University, told Reuters: &quot;It is now a foregone conclusion that Puea Thai will lead the next government even by itself, but I expect it to bring in small coalition partners, which will not only inflate its already sizeable majority but also further weaken the opposition.&quot; Yingluck said she had already spoken to the Chart Thai Pattana party. Analysts have warned that the election could lead to further turmoil in Thailand after years of intense political conflict. More than 90 people died last year in clashes as the military cracked down on Thaksin-supporting redshirt protesters in the centre of the capital. Exit polls had predicted an even larger margin of victory for Puea Thai, but Dr Andrew Walker, an expert on south-east Asian politics at the Australian National University, said any absolute majority would be remarkable. &quot;If they get [one], they will be only the second government in Thailand&apos;s history to do so, the first being Thaksin Shinawatra&apos;s [in 2005]. It shows this is still a very strong electoral brand,&quot; he said. Professor Thitinan Pongsudhirak, of Chulalongkorn University, said: &quot;If they win at all, it&apos;s a big statement. [It means] the ideas and policies that made [Thaksin&apos;s] original Thai Rak Thai party so electable are unstoppable and indestructible \u2026 This is a party that has been dissolved twice; its leading politicians have been banned twice; it&apos;s being led by a deposed exile and former prime minister a six-hour flight away.&quot; Abhisit came to power in a parliamentary deal after a previous Thaksin-backed party was dissolved. Redshirt leaders warned during the election they would take to the streets if opponents used legal manoeuvrings or a coup to prevent Yingluck from becoming prime minister. Analyst Chris Baker said it was likely that opponents of Thaksin had a Plan B: &quot;There have been several things said in the last week that suggest the Democrats and their supporters will accept this result \u2013 but not what it means. &quot;We are in a changing political society and there&apos;s big resistance from the old institutions: the bureaucracy, monarchy, military and a lot of the middle class.&quot; Thaksin called the preliminary outcome &quot;a step forward&quot; in an interview with the Thai PBS television station. He spoke by telephone from Dubai, where he lives in order to avoid a two-year prison sentence for abuse of power, which he says was politically motivated. &quot;People are tired of a standstill,&quot; he said. &quot;They want to see change in a peaceful manner.&quot; The billionaire draws his support largely from poorer residents in north and north-east Thailand, who see him as a champion, while the Democrats are dependent on the urban upper and middle classes in central Thailand and the south. They regard the former prime minister as corrupt and autocratic. &quot;I have been waiting five years [since the coup] for this moment,&quot; said Sompoon Tamakaew, from Ubon Ratchasani province, as he waited at the Puea Thai headquarters. &quot;Bangkok is full of the elites and upper classes, so they don&apos;t really understand how much of an impact Thaksin had.&quot; Sompoon, a 50-year-old gardener, said: &quot;I don&apos;t think [another coup] will happen, but if it does I will keep fighting.&quot; Police said more than 170,000 officers were on duty throughout the country to monitor voting by 47 million eligible Thais. Britain was among the countries warning its nationals of potential violence, urging visitors to avoid demonstrations. Victory could mark a return for exiled ex-leader The name and picture on the posters was of Yingluck Shinawatra, but it is her brother Thaksin who has defined this race \u2013 for both his passionate supporters and his bitter opponents. In a country where prime ministers have been lucky to last a full term, Thaksin won two massive election victories by wooing new money and, above all, the rural poor. But he fell foul of the Thai establishment \u2013 alarmed by his accumulation of power and warning of crony capitalism \u2013 and was toppled by the army. His opponents&apos; efforts to keep him out of power appear to have only increased his appeal. To his supporters, he has become not just the man who has raised their living standards, but the living expression of their collective will: the test of whether their voices will be respected. Puea Thai, the latest incarnation of his party, campaigned in a large part on a possible amnesty allowing him to return to Thailand \u2013 a hugely popular policy for his tens of millions of supporters. Yet Yingluck repeatedly said it was not a priority and that an amnesty would not be about one person. Thaksin told the Thai PBS television station on Sunday that he hoped to return: &quot;I have wanted to come back since yesterday, but I do not want to create problems.&quot; Chris Baker, who co-authored the biography Thaksin, said the party had to be &quot;two-faced&quot; because of his polarising effect. &quot;One thing they are going to have to manage very carefully is any possible rehabilitation of him into a political role. They are not stupid and realise it would galvanise a significant body of opposition,&quot; he added. Somjai Phagaphasvivat, a political scientist at Thammasat University, told Reuters: &quot;What we should watch is on whether Puea Thai might exploit the overwhelming poll numbers, interpreting it as a public mandate for the party to bring Thaksin home quickly \u2026 The Thaksin amnesty issue will determine where Thai politics is heading. It is going to be a potentially big destabilising factor.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-07-03T10:02:27Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Thaksin Shinawatra", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/03/thai-exit-polls-redshirt-landslide", "title": "Thai exit polls signal redshirt landslide", "sentences": ["Hundreds of red-shirted supporters flocked to the party&apos;s Bangkok headquarters, chanting, cheering and applauding as results came in.", "&quot;Bangkok is full of the elites and upper classes, so they don&apos;t really understand how much of an impact Thaksin had.&quot; Sompoon, a 50-year-old gardener, said: &quot;I don&apos;t think [another coup] will happen, but if it does I will keep fighting.&quot; Police said more than 170,000 officers were on duty throughout the country to monitor voting by 47 million eligible Thais."]}, {"article": "     Thailand&apos;s Democrat government has conceded defeat in Sunday&apos;s election \u2013 putting Yingluck Shinawatra on course to become the country&apos;s first female leader, five years after her brother Thaksin was toppled as prime minister in a coup.

Thaksin&apos;s younger sister Yingluck, who fronts the Puea Thai party, announced she had agreed a coalition deal with four minor parties that would give the new government 299 seats. Puea Thai won an absolute majority with 264 seats in the 500-seat parliament, according to preliminary election commission results that could still shift somewhat. But by moving fast to cement its triumph with outside support has made it harder for opponents to intervene. It paves the way for Yingluck to become the country&apos;s first female prime minister. Thaksin was toppled by a military coup in 2006 and now lives in Dubai as a fugitive due to an abuse of power conviction that he says was politically motivated. His Thai Rak Thai party and its successor were also disbanded and many of their leaders banned from politics \u2013 yet he continued to command massive popular support, as the electoral landslide showed. Puea Thai campaigned on the promise: Thaksin thinks \u2013 Puea Thai does. Yingluck said her first task was the &quot;roadmap to reconciliation&quot; after years of unrest. She also cited the need to tackle high prices, improve international relations and curb corruption. Meanwhile, outgoing Democrat prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said he had decided to step down as party leader, although his right-hand man, Surichoke Sopha, also a Democrat MP, said he believed the party still wanted Abhisit. Surichoke added: &quot;I don&apos;t think this [Puea Thai] government will last long ... They will have to compromise with the ruling class and at the same time satisfy the grassroots.&quot; The country has become polarised between Thaksin supporters, particularly the rural poor and new money \u2013 and the old elites that sought to keep him from power with the support of the urban middle classes. The split became even more entrenched when more than 90 people died as the military cracked down on Thaksin-supporting protesters in the centre of Bangkok last year. While redshirt leaders were jailed over the demonstrations, the government refused to acknowledge that the army had caused any deaths. General Prawit Wongsuwan, a former army chief close to leaders involved in the ousting of Thaksin, said the military would not intervene or stop Yingluck forming a government. &quot;I can assure you that the military has no desire to stray out of its assigned roles,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;The army accepts the election results.&quot; Political analyst Chris Baker cautioned: &quot;They always say they have nothing to do with politics and then they keep interfering.&quot; But he added: &quot;They are obviously feeling quite sensitive after the last five years. They know they made a mess of it. &quot;They are going to be very reluctant to make a move that puts them in the public eye in politics. They are going to pull the strings of the [anti-Thaksin, conservative and monarchist] yellowshirts and that sort of thing. I think we are more likely to see a formula of street demonstrations and judicial action [than coups].&quot; Activist and former senator Jon Ungpakorn believed the scale of the Puea Thai win should offer protection against a coup even in the long term. &quot;I&apos;m not so concerned about the army now and more that the [anti-Thaksin] People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy and ultra-nationalist and monarchist sections of society may cause trouble.&quot; He predicted attempts to disband the party, perhaps because of the involvement of Thaksin, who is banned from political activity in Thailand. Democrats have made it clear they will challenge Puea Thai wins in particular constituencies on legal grounds, but the sheer number of seats Puea Thai won means that may not have much impact on the overall outcome. Ungpakorn added: &quot;At the same time we need a lively criticism of the new government and not allow Puea Thai to behave like the old Thaksin government trying to stifle political opposition and criticism.&quot; Experts say much will also depend on how carefully Puea Thai plays its hand. They campaigned in part on an amnesty for Thaksin, but know that bringing him back too quickly could galvanise opposition. Speaking from Dubai, Thaksin told reporters: &quot;In Thailand, things are changing. I don&apos;t think a coup d&apos;etat will happen again soon.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-07-04T09:03:43Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Thaksin Shinawatra", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/04/thai-army-not-challenge-shinawatra", "title": "Thai army 'will not challenge' Yingluck Shinawatra coalition", "sentences": ["The split became even more entrenched when more than 90 people died as the military cracked down on Thaksin-supporting protesters in the centre of Bangkok last year."]}, {"article": "It is a strange election where the party that wins an overwhelming majority in parliament seeks the next day to bolster that advantage by forming a coalition with four others. Puea Thai, the party loyal to the exiled billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra, won 31 more seats in Thailand&apos;s general election on Sunday than its disbanded predecessor, the People&apos;s Power party, won in 2007, and this in a race whose rules had been changed to favour the losing side. The result was a major rejection of the military crackdown last year and all the establishment had done since the military coup in 2006. The incumbent prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva resigned on Monday as head of the Democrat party and army generals all dutifully said they would not interfere. So on the face of it, there was no reason for Puea Thai to have increased its majority from 264 to 299 seats, forming a coalition to secure two thirds of the parliament. But this is Thailand, and anyone who thinks the losing side of generals, royalists, and the senior elders of Thai society are going to play a constructive role in opposition has another thing coming. They will bide their time. Barely\u00a0had the preliminary results been announced than the election commission said it was investigating claims of fraud, which could disqualify candidates and reduce the size of the Puea Thai\u00a0victory. Clearly a truce of sorts has been reached between the two camps, which only a year ago reduced the commercial centre of Bangkok to a battle zone and brought the country to the verge of civil war. The military will respect the results of the election which will allow Mr Thaksin&apos;s youngest sister, Yingluck, to form the next government, just as long as the man himself, who lives in exile in Dubai, is not allowed to slip back into the country. Members of Puea Thai initially talked of a political amnesty, which could allow Mr Thaksin, who has been found guilty of corruption by a Thai court, to return. But they have backed away from it since, and Mr Thaksin said he had no immediate plans to return. For those who have grave doubts about Mr Thaksin (both in terms of corruption and the brutal war on drugs he launched when prime minister) but who also abhor what the old elite have done since the coup, the Puea Thai victory represents an opportunity. It is time to recognise the demands of the rural and urban poor. The Democrat party started to do this earlier this year in a nine-point plan that included expanding social security and low-interest loans to taxi and motorcycle drivers. But it was too late for them.

No one was more startled than Chuwit Kamolvisit, the former brothel tycoon who reinvented himself as an anti-corruption campaigner, to learn that his Love Thailand party had won four seats. He had hoped for two at best, but won support as the anti-politics candidate in a vicious contest between the incumbent Democrats and the Puea Thai opposition fronted by Yingluck Shinawatra. Startling quotes and attention-grabbing posters added to his appeal. &quot;Politicians are like diapers: you have to change them often or they are too dirty,&quot; said the moustachioed party boss, explaining why he was cuddling a baby in one advert. He shared another advert with his white bull terrier, and screwed up his face in rage on a third. &quot;The dog is a symbol of loyalty \u2013 every country needs loyalty from politicians, but we never get it. We only get it from dogs,&quot; he said. &quot;And my angry face \u2013 people say, Mr Chuwit, why is your face so angry? I say, politicians become actors, and my campaign is about opposition.&quot; He said his manifesto was entirely serious, however, adding that people are sick of the Democrats, Puea Thai and of crooked politics in general. He vowed from the start that if elected he would serve in opposition as a watchdog. Chuwit became an unlikely hero after he lifted the lid on widespread corruption by exposing the massive bribes he had paid to police to keep his brothels running. &quot;We all make mistakes, but I accept I did massage parlours.

It was rocket-fuelled. Just over six weeks ago, the businesswoman agreed to stand for office for the first time. Today she is on the verge of becoming Thailand&apos;s first female prime minister \u2013 all the more impressive given the country&apos;s generally macho political culture. Yet she may be the exception that proves a rule. Already, the wider region has seen a string of dynastic female leaders: behind almost every successful woman\u00a0lies a powerful man. &quot;This is the magic formula for Asia,&quot; says Bangkok-based political analyst Chris Baker. &quot;You take the political capital from a male who has come before; you take the sheer novelty of a\u00a0woman in a male-biased political culture. You add &apos;good, feminine&apos;, caring virtues and so on \u2013 and it seems to be a powerful combination. What is striking is that most of them have lasted some time and done quite well. [The dynastic factor] is not only very powerful in terms of coming to power\u00a0but, by and large, it seems, in\u00a0staying there.&quot; In Yingluck&apos;s case, the man is, of course, her elder brother Thaksin: the former prime minister who has polarised Thai political culture and now lives in exile. But the phenomenon began in 1960 with Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka, the world&apos;s first female prime minister, who took power following her husband&apos;s assassination. Her daughter, Chandrika Kumaratunga, later became president. It applies to Pakistan&apos;s Benazir Bhutto, India&apos;s Indira Gandhi and Indonesia&apos;s Megawati Sukarnoputri, all\u00a0of whom followed in their fathers&apos; footsteps. The Philippines has seen both Corazon Aquino and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo take charge \u2013 following their father and husband respectively \u2013 while Sheikh Hasina Wajed, daughter of Bangladesh&apos;s first president, has been prime minister twice; in between, the post was held by Khaleda Zia, a\u00a0presidential widow. In Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi, who is leading resistance to the military junta, is the daughter of independence hero Aung San. Wan Azizah Wan Ismail led Malaysia&apos;s opposition when her husband Anwar Ibrahim was ousted and jailed; though she resigned her parliamentary seat on his return, she remains president of the People&apos;s Justice Party. Farida Jalalzai, a political scientist at\u00a0the University of Missouri-St Louis, says that although numerically more men have capitalised on family connections, the proportion of women leaders with family ties is far higher. The phenomenon is also much more pronounced in south and south-east Asia and Latin America than other parts of the world, where female leaders tend to have\u00a0emerged under their own steam. While it is hard to generalise about these countries, where women have vastly differing experiences, they have one thing in common: they are countries without a history of female political leadership. In particular, they have no self-made equivalent of Angela Merkel, Margaret Thatcher or Julia Gillard. These dynastic leaders emerge when the men have already left the stage: often murdered by opponents, or otherwise incapacitated. Frequently, there is no male alternative \u2013 perhaps because sons are too young; perhaps because others are not up to the task. &quot;Sometimes a brother simply is not skilful enough \u2013 he doesn&apos;t have the acumen or the character,&quot; says Claudia Derichs of the Philipp University of Marburg, who has researched female dynastic leaders. But she adds that women could be particularly attractive to those casting about for a successor: &quot;They somehow have an image of being more morally endowed.&quot; Yingluck is unusual in following her brother, but Derichs thinks she fits the mould of dynastic leaders perfectly. Yingluck has described Thaksin as a second father \u2013 he is 17 years her senior \u2013 and although he is still alive, he was removed from Thailand&apos;s political stage by a military coup. He now lives in Dubai, as a fugitive from corruption charges that he says were politically motivated. And like many of the other women leaders, 44-year-old Yingluck has run explicitly under her relative&apos;s mantle. The party she fronts used the slogan &quot;Thaksin thinks \u2013 Puea Thai does&quot; and her brother has described her as his &quot;clone&quot; \u2013 later caveating that he meant she shares his way of thinking.     Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi shakes hands with Pakistan's president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, with his daughter Benazir Bhutto beside him, 1972. Photograph: Agence France Presse/AFP/Getty Images    &quot;I think people choose some women because they think they are more likely to be benchwarmers per se and that they can &apos;take on&apos; the identities of their male relatives better than a man who perhaps has his own independent political agenda,&quot; says Jalalzai. &quot;Sometimes these women actually campaign that they will represent their male relative&apos;s agenda and will utilise traditional conceptions of women&apos;s role in the family in doing so. This often resonates with the public, who would not normally elect a woman to the position.&quot; That is certainly true for Yingluck, who repeatedly asked voters on the campaign trail: &quot;If you love my brother,\u00a0will you give his younger sister a chance?&quot; Her path may have been somewhat easier than that of other female leaders in Asia. While Thai women have struggled in the political realm \u2013 only an eighth of MPs are female and at the grassroots, village heads are overwhelmingly male \u2013 they have been highly successful in other spheres. Earlier this year a report by accountants Grant Thornton said Thailand boasted the highest proportion (45%) of women in\u00a0senior roles in business; 30% of companies had female CEOs. Many in Thailand are proud to have elected a female leader and even senior Democrats, bitterly opposed to Puea Thai, suggest the voters&apos; willingness to\u00a0back a woman speaks well for the country. A survey by the Matichon newspaper, asking what people thought of having a female prime minister, found that 70% saw it as a move in the right direction and an indication of equality. &quot;I&apos;m sick of men in politics. They are\u00a0good at being corrupt. They are not as responsible as women,&quot; declared Bangkok noodle seller Somiat Kiatsommart, one of the voters who swept Puea Thai to victory. But he acknowledged that Yingluck \u2013 the youngest of nine children \u2013 had not been an obvious choice. &quot;All of Thaksin&apos;s brothers are stupid. If they were actually clever, he would have asked one of them.&quot; In fact, Thaksin was succeeded by his ally Samak Sundaravej and his brother-in-law Somchai Wongsawat \u2013 both disqualified from office \u2013 before he asked his youngest sister to stand. &quot;It is the skilful use of family ties rather than family ties alone that positions one as a successful candidate,&quot; says Jalalzai, adding that in most cases women with such connections were very politically experienced before taking office. At the start of the campaign, many saw Yingluck as little more than a puppet and questioned her nomination. &quot;Actually it turned out to be a\u00a0brilliant choice,&quot; says Kevin Hewison, an expert on Thailand at the University of North Carolina. &quot;She electrified the\u00a0campaign.&quot; Although an electoral neophyte, she learned quickly. True, she has been surrounded by experienced political figures, has spoken to her brother two or three times a week, and has stuck tightly to the script. She dodged a debate with Democratic prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva that would probably have exposed her weaknesses. But many contenders \u2013 male as well as female - have been unable to stick to a\u00a0political message and observe the discipline of a campaign; and many struggle to deliver fluent presentations or engage with ordinary voters. Yingluck wowed the vast rallies as she sped along the campaign trail. &quot;I might be new to being a politician, but I have had experience of politics from a young age . . . I understand it very well and especially on 19 September [2006, the day Thaksin was toppled] I learned the nature of politics,&quot; she told the Guardian last week. Her father was an MP; her sister a mayor; and, of course, she has seen her brother&apos;s rise. She also became involved with Puea Thai after Thaksin fled to Dubai. In a 2009 cable obtained by WikiLeaks, the then US ambassador to Bangkok noted: &quot;Yingluck appeared far more poised during this meeting than she has been in the past. She spoke with confidence about party operations, strategy and goals . . . While it was obvious that politics does not come as naturally to Yingluck as it does to her brother, one suspects she may well have a bright future with the party.&quot; The depiction of female leaders as innocents reflects enduring stereotypes about women in politics, but it can also be exploited by them. They can embody the promise of change and represent moral purity in comparison to their opponents. &quot;I think this time people don&apos;t want me to be acting as a politician, but knowing how to solve problems and I\u00a0can use my experience in management,&quot; Yingluck says, pointing to her experience heading one of the Shinawatra family&apos;s companies. Democrats say they also found it harder to counter Puea Thai because they did not want to be seen as bullying a woman \u2013 a factor Derichs believes is\u00a0common. Surichoke Sopha, a Democrat MP, argues that Yingluck&apos;s femininity put his party on the defensive. &quot;It was her strong point, and it is all about turning strong points into weak points . . . But our campaign people decided not to touch it,&quot; he says. That may have been wise: the Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos attempted to dismiss Aquino as\u00a0&quot;just a housewife&quot; \u2013 a tag she embraced and turned to her advantage. But once Yingluck is in charge, experts say, she will be subject to all the same mud-slinging that a man would be in what promises to be an enduring and bitter political conflict. Her brother has divided Thai politics: while many see him as a champion of the rural poor, the urban middle and upper classes regard him as authoritarian and corrupt. In comparison, she explicitly drew on her gender to position herself as a reconciliation candidate in the campaign. &quot;I will utilise my femininity to work fully for our country,&quot; she promised. &quot;She is more gentle, more understanding and more serene&quot; says Prapat Chongsanguan of the Puea Thai economic working group. &quot;It will be better for the atmosphere right now: People won&apos;t feel so threatened.&quot; But Chalidaporn Songsamphan, a well-known feminist and a professor at\u00a0Thammasat University, warns that hopes are dangerously high. &quot;It&apos;s not that easy to reconcile these groups. People are expecting too much from her just because she&apos;s a woman,&quot; she says. &quot;People are expecting her to be amother to Thai society.&quot; Chalidaporn also notes that dynastic women often struggle to establish themselves. While Thaksin&apos;s parties have included some powerful and competent women, &quot;It&apos;s difficult to see\u00a0[Yingluck] from a different perspective than as a proxy for her brother,&quot; she says. Though Yingluck insists she will lead in her own right, taking advice from Thaksin but making the key decisions, observers are highly sceptical \u2013 particularly given his centrality to the campaign, and Puea Thai&apos;s keenness to introduce an amnesty allowing him to return. But Jalalzai says that, in other cases, female leaders have proved far less malleable than men have assumed. &quot;The reality is that most of the time these women have their own political agendas and are usually not easily controlled by men.&quot; Family disputes are not uncommon. Many of the women who voted for Yingluck hope that she will develop her own set of priorities, tackling issues that disproportionately affect them. &quot;She might bring in more women&apos;s rights,&quot; says soft drinks vendor Sukhpatra Chockmo. &quot;A lot of\u00a0women suffer domestic abuse and rape; I hope she can improve the\u00a0situation.&quot; But Virada Somswadi, founder of Chiang Mai University&apos;s women&apos;s studies programme, told the Bangkok Post that Yingluck entered politics &quot;because of other political factors. She cannot be a representative of women&apos;s groups, because she has never expressed her vision and stance regarding the protection of women&apos;s interests.&quot; Female leaders do not always promote female-focused policies, nor promote other women. Nor do they necessarily make it easier for other women to follow in their footsteps \u2013 even women with similarly powerful family connections.

As deputy chief operating officer of News Corp \u2013 the US-listed company that is the ultimate owner of News International (NI), which in turn owns the News of the World, the Times, the Sunday Times and the Sun \u2013 the younger Murdoch has admitted he misled parliament over phone hacking, although he has stated he did not have the complete picture at the time. There have also been reports that employees routinely made payments to police officers, believed to total more than \u00a3100,000, in return for information. The payments could leave News Corp \u2013 and possibly James Murdoch himself \u2013 facing the possibility of prosecution in the US under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) \u2013 legislation designed to stamp out bad corporate behaviour that carries severe penalties for anyone found guilty of breaching it \u2013 and in the UK under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 which outlaws the interception of communications. Tony Woodcock, a partner at the City law firm Stephenson Harwood, said section 79 of the 2000 Act enabled criminal proceedings to be brought against not only a company, but also a director or similar officer where the offence was committed with their &quot;consent or connivance&quot; or was &quot;attributable to any neglect on their part&quot;. Woodcock said: &quot;This could embrace a wide number of people at the highest level within an organisation, such as a chief executive \u2013 not just the individual who &apos;pushed the button&apos; allowing the intercept to take place or someone (perhaps less senior) who encouraged or was otherwise an accessory to the offence, such as an editor.&quot; While the UK phone-hacking scandal has been met with outrage in the US, the hacking itself is unlikely to prompt Washington officials into action. But because NI is a subsidiary of the US company, any payments to UK police officers could trigger a justice department inquiry under the FCPA. The 1977 Act generally prohibits American companies and citizens from corruptly paying \u2013 or offering to pay \u2013 foreign officials to obtain or retain business. The Butler University law professor Mike Koehler, an FCPA expert, said: &quot;I would be very surprised if the US authorities don&apos;t become involved in this [NI] conduct.&quot; He said the scandal appeared to qualify as an FCPA case on two counts. First, News Corp is a US-listed company, giving the US authorities jurisdiction to investigate allegations. &quot;Second, perhaps more importantly, the act requires that payments to government officials need to be in the furtherance of &apos;obtaining or retaining&apos; business. If money is being paid to officials, in this case the police, in order to get information to write sensational stories to sell newspapers, that would qualify,&quot; he said. Koehler said the US justice department was increasingly keen to bring cases against individuals as well as companies, because prosecuting people brought &quot;maximum deterrence&quot;. He added: &quot;Companies just pay out shareholders&apos; money. There&apos;s not much deterrence there.&quot; Tom Fox, a Houston-based lawyer who specialises in FCPA cases and anti-corruption law, said most corporate cases were settled before going\u00a0to court. But for individuals who are successfully prosecuted the penalties are severe. In 2009 the former Hollywood movie producer Gerald Green and his wife, Patricia, were jailed for six months in the first criminal case under the FCPA. The Greens, whose credits included Werner Herzog&apos;s Rescue Dawn, were convicted of paying $1.8m in bribes to a government official in Thailand in exchange for contracts to manage the Bangkok international film festival. FCPA charges can carry up to five years in jail for each charge but the Greens&apos; short prison sentence was not the harshest element of their sentencing. The &quot;biggest hammer&quot; prosecutors hold is forfeiture of assets, said Fox. &quot;The Greens lost everything. Their house, savings, retirement plan. They are destitute now.&quot; Bringing an FCPA case against the company would be far easier than bringing an action against James Murdoch. As yet there appears to be no evidence that he was directly linked to authorising the police payments. &quot;If you don&apos;t know about it, that is a valid defence for an individual,&quot; said Koehler. In New York, media executives believe that with or without an FCPA case James Murdoch has already fatally damaged his chances of taking his father&apos;s crown. One said: &quot;There has been a sense of unravelling at News Corp for a while. The Daily, MySpace, Project Alesia \u2013 they look like News is chasing rainbows. [Rupert] Murdoch is looking old. It affects his ability to appoint an heir and I don&apos;t think James even has the backing of his family any more.&quot; Speculation is that Chase Carey, the chief operating officer, is most likely to take the top slot when and if the media mogul steps aside. &quot;He is the ultimate Murdoch operative. He is not interested in the trappings of the media business. What would he do? Close the New York Post, sell the Times. Why not? It&apos;s a rational thing to do.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-07-08T19:18:44Z", "tags": ["James Murdoch", "Phone hacking", "News Corporation", "News UK", "News of the World", "Newspapers & magazines", "National newspapers", "Newspapers", "Media", "UK news", "US news", "World news", "Press intrusion"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/08/james-murdoch-criminal-charges-phone-hacking", "title": "James Murdoch could face criminal charges on both sides of the Atlantic", "sentences": ["The Greens, whose credits included Werner Herzog&apos;s Rescue Dawn, were convicted of paying $1.8m in bribes to a government official in Thailand in exchange for contracts to manage the Bangkok international film festival."]}, {"article": "At first the tablets made life easier for Santhisuk: they helped him endure the long hours lugging heavy fabric bales in a Bangkok textiles factory. Gradually he noticed he was angrier and more aggressive on the days he skipped them. But it was only when arrested for a third time \u2013 and sent to rehabilitation at a Buddhist temple \u2013 that he admitted his addiction to methamphetamine. Now clean, the 19-year-old labourer is worrying about what will happen when he leaves the sanctuary of Wat Saphan and returns home. &quot;It will be difficult because all my friends still take it. Drug use is so widespread now that everybody thinks it&apos;s normal,&quot; he said. Monks at the temple in Klong Toey, one of Bangkok&apos;s poorest areas, say they have seen a huge increase in addiction rates. The problem has spread far beyond the Thai capital. The number of methamphetamine users in Thailand will reach 1.1 million this year, the head of the country&apos;s anti-drug police told the Guardian - equivalent to one in every 60 citizens. The number of users has soared by 100,000 annually over the last five to six years, said Lieutenant-General Atitep Panjamanond. Yingluck Shinawatra, the prime minister in waiting, has already pledged &quot;a new war on drugs&quot; to eliminate them within 12 months, alarming human rights groups who fear a repeat of her brother&apos;s 2003 crackdown. More than 2,500 people died in three months after Thaksin Shinawatra ordered police to draw up blacklists of suspected dealers and act &quot;decisively and without mercy&quot;. Though the police blamed gang crime for most of the deaths - they said 68 were shot by officers &quot;in self-defence&quot; - human rights groups say there is compelling evidence of extra-judicial killings. A committee later reported that more than half the dead, including a nine-year-old boy, had not been involved in the drugs trade. But the campaign was hugely popular and as drug use rises, many want a return to tough action. &quot;Personally, I think the killings were a good thing. If you leave it to the courts [dealers] just cycle in and out of prison,&quot; said Aminna Bedinlae, 84, who lost her son to drugs and now runs anti-abuse programmes in Klong Toey, where 46 residents were shot. Substance abuse had always been rife in the Bangkok slum, but in the past glue-sniffing was more common, said the 84-year-old. &quot;Now they start off sniffing glue at six or seven and move on ... [Methamphetamine] is more expensive so they get involved with crime \u2013 theft or burglary\u2013 and it makes them more aggressive. &quot;My neighbour&apos;s son steals from the family and demands 300 baht [for drugs] every day. If she hasn&apos;t got it, he hits her.&quot; Drivers and labourers have long relied on methamphetamine tablets \u2013 known here as yaba or &quot;crazy drug&quot; \u2013 to sustain them through gruelling work sessions. But Atitep said recreational use was extremely common and that children as young as 13 are taking it, with five- and six-year-olds being used as mules. Last month the public health minister said 6,700 children aged 7 to 17 were rehabilitated in the first half of this year. Experts warn regular use can lead to addiction and psychiatric problems, and say the drug is associated with violent and aggressive behaviour. Atitep said about 70% of methamphetamine comes across the Burmese border and blamed ethnic militias for churning out more drugs to fund their fight against the regime. The price of a tablet has fallen to as little as 150 baht (\u00a33) in places; half the 2004 price. His department seized 33m tablets in 2009, and 60m last year. &quot;That doesn&apos;t give me pleasure, because there is a lot more supply,&quot; the police chief said. &quot;Today we seize 1m tablets. Tomorrow they produce 2m.&quot; One of his teams had just seized 30,000 tablets in Nakhon Pathom province. But officers who traced the gang bosses behind the deal discovered they were already jailed and had continued to trade via smuggled mobile phones. Atitep said changes in values and society were contributing to increasing drug use. Others say the economic fall out from 2008&apos;s global downturn, and the distraction of authorities by political turmoil, have exacerbated problems. Some allege that corrupt officers are facilitating the trade. At Wat Saphan, monks fear another crackdown would only push problems underground. &quot;When Thaksin came along it was brutal. There was shooting \u2014 bam, bam, bam \u2013 and were the results worth it?&quot; asked one monk, Phra Kru Manit. &quot;Do you know who the kingpins are? Do you know which officials are involved? Deal with that, then deal with the problem on the streets.&quot; The real solution lay in rehabilitation programmes and better educational and economic opportunities for residents, he argued. Yingluck told AFP before the election that she would &quot;handle the drugs policy with care [for] human rights&quot;. Montira Kantapin, a spokeswoman for Yingluck&apos;s Puea Thai party, said a working group was considering options. &quot;No one is disputing the government&apos;s desire to take on the drugs industry. It is the means we are concerned about,&quot; said Benjamin Zawacki, Amnesty International&apos;s south-east Asia researcher. Sunai Phasuk of fellow charity Human Rights Watch said Yingluck&apos;s pledge to eradicate drugs was the group&apos;s biggest concern. The outgoing government had identified suspects in a similar way but &quot;with the Democrats&apos; approach they are sent to a bootcamp facility [without proper medical help to quit]; with Thaksin&apos;s approach they might end up dead,&quot; he said. He said that many of those killed in the 2003 crackdown had been &quot;victims of personal revenge or sloppy categorisation&quot;.

The overall poverty rate is expected to fall below 15% by 2015, fulfilling the target of the first MDG of halving the proportion of people living on less than $1 per day. That in itself is a remarkable achievement. Yet, as the UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, acknowledged earlier this month, the world needs to look beyond 2015, even though progress on the MDGs has been fitful. &quot;When the MDGs were first articulated, we knew that achieving them would, in a sense, be only half the job,&quot; he said. &quot;We knew that too many men, women and children would go largely untouched by even our best efforts. That is why we are already working with all our partners to sustain the momentum and to carry on with an ambitious post-2015 development agenda.&quot; With four years left until the 2015 deadline, suggestions abound as to what that agenda should be. Some of them received an airing this week at a discussion held in Parliament. Kudakwashe Dube, chief executive of the Secretariat of the African Decade of Persons with Disabilities, made the practical point that people with disabilities should be taken into account in any post-2015 framework, as they were not included in the MDGs at all. &quot;The voices of the poor did not come through in the MDGs and those of disability [were] left out completely,&quot; he said. &quot;Our hope post-2015 is that there will be a strong focus on human rights and how disabilities related to them.&quot; According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), about 15% of the world&apos;s population - or 1 billion - lives with some form of disability. The global prevalence of disability, said a WHO report in June, is higher than previous figures, which date from the 1970s and suggested a number around 10%. The WHO said the MDGs may not be met by 2015 unless urgent action is taken to address the needs of people with disabilities. Few would quarrel with Dube&apos;s plea to put people with disabilities on the agenda, but devising broader targets means moving on to trickier ground. As the Lancet pointed out in an excellent report last September, the MDGs were effectively a synthesis of neoliberal thinking (economic growth based on free trade and markets) and a human development approach (health, education and gender equity). Backed by 189 governments, the targets represented an unprecedented consensus and were more successful than previous UN development initiatives. But the ambitious nature of the undertaking meant omissions were inevitable. The Lancet notes that the absence of focus on equity could be the most serious shortcoming of the MDGs, a point that has also been made on the Poverty Matters blog by Jonathan Glennie. The multilateral institutions have belatedly recognised that unless growth is inclusive, countries are storing up trouble for later, as borne out by Tunisia and Egypt, to cite the most dramatic examples. Taking a provocative approach, Professor Allister McGregor, research fellow at the Institute of Development Studies, said in this week&apos;s debate that the MDGs were not fit for 2015. He argued for putting the notion of wellbeing into the next phase and for more sophisticated ways of looking at poverty. The MDGs, he said, had provided good momentum but the world needed to move beyond targets. &quot;Poor people are not just defined by poverty,&quot; he said. &quot;They have aspirations ... we need to ask: what do you want to achieve and what are the obstacles that systematically frustrate you?&quot; Referring to the Arab spring, McGregor said the events in north Africa underlined the importance of trying to incorporate the concept of wellbeing, as prosperity without freedom had proved destabilising. He also cited the contrast between Bangkok and the poor rural northeast, where farmers were committing suicide because they had fallen into debt. &quot;It&apos;s basically about inequality, how we live well together and how we share wealth,&quot; said McGregor. &quot;Let&apos;s get it on the agenda and have people work on wellbeing. We have to start coming up with new ideas on how we measure what we value.&quot; McGregor summed up wellbeing in an IDS report in 2009 as what a person has, what a person can do with what they have, and how they think about what they have and can do. It also involves the interplay of the resources a person is able to command: what they are able to achieve with those resources, what needs and goals they can meet, and the meaning they give to the goals they achieve and the processes in which they engage. The notions of wellbeing and happiness are being taken increasingly seriously by governments, so it would not be surprising if they are taken into account in the post-MDG phase. The Stiglitz commission in France recommended in 2009 that statistical surveys should &quot;incorporate questions to capture people&apos;s life evaluations, hedonic experiences and priorities&quot; and last year the British prime minister David Cameron started work with the Office for National Statistics on how to measure wellbeing. But as former Scottish first minister Baron McConnell warned, there is a risk that the pursuit of more ambitious and nebulous goals will let governments off the hook. &quot;If you want to pin governments down, you need precise targets,&quot; he said.", "publicationDate": "2011-07-15T11:02:00Z", "tags": ["The future of development", "Global development", "Millennium development goals", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jul/15/millennium-development-goals-beyond-2015", "title": "Whither the post-MDG development agenda?", "sentences": ["He also cited the contrast between Bangkok and the poor rural northeast, where farmers were committing suicide because they had fallen into debt."]}, {"article": "GREECE     The Greek Flag Photograph: Observer    Tom Holland, classical historian and novelist This has not been a good year for the Greeks, but it has been an excellent one for books on a Greek theme.

SPAIN     Spanish National Flag Photograph: Victor Watts /Alamy    Julius Purcell, Barcelona-based culture writer Spanish fiction lists are dominated by Javier Mar\u00edas, lugubrious to some and monumentally beautiful to others. A good start is Tomorrow in the Battle Think on Me (Vintage \u00a39.99), about an adultery gone horribly wrong, and which I found to be lugubrious\u2026 and monumentally beautiful. Many novels about Spain are now being written by South American immigrant writers. Of the few translated so far, the late Roberto Bola\u00f1o&apos;s The Skating Rink (Picador \u00a37.99), a Catalan love story featuring embezzled public money, is a good example. Classics that can be found in English, and which deeply affected me, include Ram\u00f3n J Sender&apos;s 1960 Requiem for a Spanish Peasant (Aris &amp; Phillips \u00a314.95), about a village that becomes a microcosm of the Spanish civil war. Juan Mars\u00e9&apos;s Golden Girl is a witty portrait of a mediocre pro-Franco writer, who, after the death of the dictator, tortuously rewrites his own life history with the help of his unstable\u00a0niece. Among the best of recent non-fiction is Javier Cercas&apos;s The Anatomy of a Moment (Bloomsbury \u00a318.99), a part-investigative, part-narrative analysis of the 1981 coup attempt against the Spanish parliament. John Hooper&apos;s The New Spaniards (Penguin \u00a310.99) surveys the country&apos;s ultra-traditional/ultra-modern paradox, while Giles Tremlett&apos;s Ghosts of Spain (Faber \u00a39.99) expertly exorcises Spain&apos;s contemporary traumas. FRANCE     Flag of France on blue background Tricolor.

In complete contrast is Voice Over (Faber \u00a310.99), a novel by C\u00e9line Curiol, which is an example of what I&apos;d call Eurostar literature. It&apos;s about a woman who reads out the announcements at the Gare du Nord in Paris and is completely bored and ready for sexual adventure, which she finds by falling in love with a transvestite. It&apos;s like an uber-sexy Tale of Two Cities. My favourite French classic has to be Journey to the End of the Night (Oneworld \u00a312.99) by Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line. It&apos;s an epic that takes you all around the world, but the centre of the world is Paris, or C\u00e9line&apos;s delirious, slightly hallucinatory, incredibly poetic vision of it. There are two translations but neither conveys the scabrous energy of Parisian lowlife slang, so it&apos;s best to read it in the original. GREAT BRITAIN     Union jack flag Photograph: Alamy    Alain de Botton, author and social entrepreneur If you&apos;re holidaying at home in the UK, you might want to bring along Gavin Pretor-Pinney&apos;s The Cloudspotter&apos;s Guide (Sceptre \u00a38.99), because it encourages us to give up on the false dichotomy between good weather (cloudless) and bad weather (cloudy) and learn to appreciate the hidden beauty and complexity of an unclear sky. Because no good holiday is complete without fierce arguments, bring along a great British therapist such as Donald Winnicott, author of the beautiful, useful and lyrical book Home Is Where We Start From (Penguin\u00a0\u00a312.99). One of the joys of holidaying at home is the capacity to dream about what it might be like if you were somewhere else, without encountering the disappointing reality. This is one of the themes of the wonderful Geoff Dyer&apos;s book Yoga for People Who Can&apos;t Be Bothered to Do It (Abacus \u00a38.99).

Published posthumously in 1958 and set during the Risorgimento, it appears to be a perfect metaphor of all things Italian, back then and, most importantly, now: the clash between the north and the south, the complex idea of Italy&apos;s wholeness, the sense of cynical realism and resignation embedded in everyone&apos;s way of thinking \u2013 just to name a few. Plus Tancredi&apos;s ever-lasting quote: &quot;If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change.&quot; Ignazio Silone&apos;s Fontamara is a novel set during the fascist era in a fictional village in central Italy&apos;s Abruzzo region. Its passive and vulnerable peasants live in misery, the outside world barely exists and their only tangible relationship is with the soil they cultivate. Because of fascism&apos;s censorship, Fontamara wasn&apos;t published in Italy until 1947, and soon after it became a fundamental document to understand the complexity of Italy&apos;s south. Another insightful tool for this is Roberto Saviano&apos;s Gomorrah (Pan\u00a0\u00a38.99), in which the Sistema (the\u00a0name used in the Campania region instead of Camorra) has created a parallel criminal\u00a0world, organised beyond anyone&apos;s imagination and, apparently, beyond any possibility of being\u00a0dismantled. TURKEY     Turkish flag Photograph: Observer    Maureen Freely, novelist and translator of\u00a0Orhan Pamuk Princess Musbah Haider had an English mother but grew up in the Ottoman court during the early years of the 20th century. Around her, the empire was crumbling, but she was one of the last to know. Her memoir, Arabesque, is one of the most charming books I have ever\u00a0read. Carla Grissman is an American woman who spent a year in a remote and impoverished Anatolian village in the late 1960s; in Dinner of Herbs, she describes her experiences with extraordinary insight. Fifty years ago, Yashar Kemal was the Turkish novelist. His first book, Memed, My Hawk, is set among the aghas and brigands of south-east Anatolia and is one of the great modern epics. It is very unusual for a bookish person to head for Turkey these days without packing a few novels by Orhan Pamuk. But don&apos;t forget his memoir, Istanbul: Memories of a City (Faber \u00a39.99), still one of my favourite books. The Istanbul in Moris Farhi&apos;s Young Turk (Telegram \u00a38.99) is joyously multicultural, if under threat. But not forever, as Sel\u00e7uk Altun proves in his edgy, witty, dangerously literary novels, of which two \u2013 Songs My Mother Never Taught Me and Many and Many a Year Ago (both Telegram \u00a37.99) \u2013 are available in English. EGYPT     Egyptian flag Photograph: Observer    Ahdaf Soueif, Anglo\u2011Egyptian novelist  Start with The Dawn of Conscience by James Henry Breasted. It&apos;s old, but then what it deals with is even older! It&apos;s a brilliant introduction to ancient Egyptian life and thought \u2013 and its continued relevance today. The Crusades Through Arab Eyes (Saqi \u00a314.95) by eminent Lebanese author Amin Maalouf is a great read. Take care though: it&apos;s not the angle that western readers are used to. Everyone should read one Naguib Mahfouz novel. In English, Miramar is the one I&apos;d go for. Egypt: The Moment of Change (Zed \u00a316.99) edited by Rabab El Mahdi and Philip Marfleet \u2013 this provides an excellent background and interpretation of today&apos;s Egyptian\u00a0revolution. Tweets from Tahrir edited by Alex Nunns and Nadia Idle will take you right up to the present and give you a sense of the Egyptian revolution as it unfolded. UNITED STATES     American flag Photograph: Corbis    John Freeman, Granta editor Although primarily about the far north, Barry Lopez&apos;s Arctic Dreams (Vintage \u00a39.99) is a must-read for anyone travelling to North America. Lopez reminds us that long before interstates and factory farms carved it up, America was a continent of astonishing beauty. If you&apos;re going to be driving \u2013 which I recommend \u2013 bring a copy of John Steinbeck&apos;s Travels With Charley (Penguin \u00a39.99), a travelogue that covers almost 50 states. It also has a dog aboard \u2013 always a good thing in my\u00a0book. Chances are you will want to skip the Rust Belt. Don&apos;t. The story of America&apos;s decline can be seen in this necklace of creaking towns that stretches from Philadelphia up to Buffalo, over to Cleveland. Richard Russo has conjured them vividly in his novels, especially Nobody&apos;s Fool (Vintage \u00a39.99), which is raucous good\u00a0company. Finally, once you point your car left of Cleveland you&apos;re bound to head toward the high plains and the far west. No one, not even Cormac McCarthy, has captured it like Annie Proulx in Close Range (Fourth Estate \u00a37.99), her first of three collections she wrote about Wyoming. Skip Brokeback\u00a0Mountain \u2013 you know how\u00a0that ends. CROATIA     Croatian flag    Erica Zlomislic, Toronto writer who worked in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia during the 1990s wars As an alternative to the usual reporter dispatches from Croatia in the 1990s, try Island of the World by Michael D O&apos;Brien (Ignatius \u00a315.54). The novel follows the Croatian protagonist Josip Lasta through the second world war and the wars of the 1990s to eventual redemption. Have tissues at hand. For something equally dramatic try American writer and activist Julienne Eden Busic&apos;s riveting novel Lovers and Madmen: A True Story of Passion, Politics and Air Piracy (iUniverse \u00a315.99). The story starts with blonde, blue-eyed, model-like Eden falling in love with exiled Croatian dissident Zvonko Busic, who fights to gain Croatian independence from Tito&apos;s Yugoslavia. The book is rife with secret police assassinations, poverty, imprisonment, passion and, finally, a plane hijacking. For a touching collection of short stories from the 1990s Croatian war try Do Angels Cry?: Tales of the War (Ooligan \u00a37.38) by Matko Marusic. It&apos;s especially poignant now, precisely 20 years since the war broke. For something less tearful while strolling along the cobblestones of old towns, try Dubrovnik: A History (Saqi \u00a314.99) by Robin Harris. The book is a detailed history lesson explaining why the &quot;pearl of the Adriatic&quot; is more than just a pretty walled city in Croatia. THAILAND     Thai flag    Rattawut Lapcharoensap, US\u00a0novelist raised in\u00a0Bangkok For those unfamiliar with Thai literature, Kukrit Pramoj&apos;s magnum opus Four Reigns (Firecracker \u00a310.99) might be a good place to start. Though not untroubled by a certain conservative nostalgia, it&apos;s a wonderfully expansive historical novel tracing the life of one woman across the reigns of Rama V to Rama VIII, from the 1890s to the second world war. For those interested in Thai short fiction, In the Mirror: Literature and Politics in Siam in the American Era, edited and excellently translated by Benedict Anderson and Ruchira Mendiones, collects many of the major short works of the 60s and 70s, from Suchit Wongthes to Sulak Sivaraksa. Somerset Maugham&apos;s seldom-read The Gentleman in the Parlour: A Record of a Journey from Rangoon to Haiphong is a quick, interesting and, above all, sinuously written travelogue of the author&apos;s time in the region. I also greatly enjoyed Mischa Berlinski&apos;s Fieldwork (Atlantic \u00a37.99), Lily Tuck&apos;s Siam, or The Woman Who Shot the Man, and Joan Silber&apos;s recent The Size of the World. Then there&apos;s Paul M Handley&apos;s The King Never Smiles: A Biography of Thailand&apos;s Bhumibol Adulyadej (Yale \u00a325), which needs to be read before one enters the country.

The Ivory Coast forward, a \u00a324m purchase from Marseille in 2004, has entered the final 12 months of his current deal but talks are under way to add a further year to his \u00a3120,000-a-week contract. That wage had actually served to ward off his suitors this summer, Tottenham Hotspur and Marseille among them, but confirmation of an agreement is now expected before the start of the Premier League campaign next month. Asked whether he wished to extend his deal at the club with whom he has won three league titles, Drogba said: &quot;Of course, why not? We&apos;ve started talking and it&apos;s very interesting. Everybody knows what I feel about Chelsea and what I want. I will definitely be here next season. I said a few years ago that I will be here until the end of my contract, and I am here. Now I need to keep playing well here and giving my best, like I always try to do. This will be my eighth season at this club and it means a lot for any striker to stay that long at Chelsea.&quot; The \u00a350m signing of Torres in January had suggested the London club were veering away from an over-reliance on Drogba, whose campaign had previously been blunted by a bout of malaria. Yet the Spaniard has, as yet, failed to impress in the team&apos;s favoured 4-3-3 system \u2013 a shape also employed by the new manager, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas \u2013 and Drogba, a golden boot winner in 2009-10, appears more comfortable in the formation. The Ivorian has yet to be paired in a match with Torres by Villas-Boas and, with the duo having failed to fire as a partnership under Carlo Ancelotti, Drogba appears to accept that the two forwards are competing for one central role. &quot;Yes, I think we are [contending for one place],&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s the manager&apos;s choice, but it&apos;s been like this for me for all my years at this club. It was the same when Eidur Gudjohnsen was here, when [Andriy] Shevchenko was here, and all of the other\u00a0times. &quot;I&apos;m 33, I&apos;m the oldest player and, even if that feels strange, I&apos;m not worried. If I deserve to play then I will play. If I&apos;m not good then I won&apos;t. It&apos;s good for the team to have some competition. It will push the team forward and get the best out of us. For me, it&apos;s not a problem to play with Fernando or without him. The most important thing is winning games together as a team. Our goal is to win the trophies we didn&apos;t win last season. We need to do that for the\u00a0club.&quot; Chelsea are maintaining their dialogue with Anderlecht in the hope of signing their 18-year-old Belgium forward Romelu Lukaku, a player very much in Drogba&apos;s ilk. Yet the youngster may well be loaned out to gain regular first-team football given that Drogba, Torres and Nicolas Anelka, who intends to see out the final year of his contract in south-west London, are to remain at the club, with Daniel Sturridge and Salomon Kalou also competing for striking places. Another Belgian youngster, the goalkeeper Thibault Courtois signed from Genk this week, underwent a medical at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on Friday and will be loaned to the Spanish club for the season with the possibility of a second year to follow. Chelsea are also close to securing the 19-year-old Barcelona B midfielder Oriol Romeu for around \u00a34.5m. The player is in Colombia with the Spain Under-20 team.

Chelsea&apos;s spending under Villas-Boas has been restricted to deals for the teenage goalkeeper Thibault Courtois from Genk and the Barcelona\u00a0B midfielder Oriol Romeu. While talks remain on-going with Anderlecht over the signing of Romelu Lukaku, who could cost up to \u00a315m, the pursuit of Luka Modric and Scott Parker has dragged. Other Premier League challengers have strengthened early and significantly. Manchester United, who last season finished nine points clear of Chelsea, then managed by Carlo Ancelotti, have spent \u00a350m on new recruits, though Villas-Boas is convinced his squad can bridge that gap. &quot;Each club is responsible for the money they put into the market,&quot; the manager said. &quot;We put a lot of money in in January [when David Luiz and Fernando Torres were signed]. You have to value, as well, the kind of approach we are taking this summer. &quot;It&apos;s an approach made on taking wise decisions, evaluating what we have, paying respect to the valued squad we have. It&apos;s not a case of spending straight away when we don&apos;t need to do that. We hope it will prove to be the successful approach. Clubs have to spend what they have to spend. United have decided to sign players after losing some to retirement and they&apos;ve reinforced those sectors. We will decide what sectors we need to reinforce in our own team.&quot; There is a belief within the hierarchy at Chelsea that the nine-point gap conceded to United last season was deceptive and there is hope that Villas-Boas, arguably a more hands-on manager than his predecessor, will be able to get more from the squad at his disposal. Even so, the addition of a playmaker of Modric&apos;s quality has been pinpointed as a priority, particularly given the need to supply Torres more effectively. Villas-Boas, whose team play a Thailand All Star XI in Bangkok on Sunday, admitted in the past few days that a failure to\u00a0win trophies would be &quot;the end of the\u00a0world&quot;, but dismissed suggestions that Chelsea are already playing an onerous game of squad catch-up with the champions. &quot;You have to recall that Chelsea went to United with a great chance to shorten a distance that, OK, in the end, became nine points,&quot; he said, referring to the trip to Old Trafford in May when, had the visitors prevailed, they would have drawn level on points at the top of the table. &quot;It went United&apos;s way, but it could have gone Chelsea&apos;s way and changed the Premier League in the last couple of\u00a0days. &quot;Rather, recall that Chelsea came back with an extremely good recovery in terms of shortening that points distance. This club had an opportunity to win the title and that shows how competitive we can be.&quot; Chelsea hope to conclude Romeu&apos;s \u00a34.5m arrival from Barcelona B over the next 24 hours, with Courtois also to conclude his arrival and immediate loan to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. &quot;The Spanish league is an extremely competitive league and a great place for him to be,&quot; Villas-Boas said. &quot;With Oriol, the club have agreed terms with Barcelona and now it is about personal terms and a medical. &quot;That sector, central midfield, was an area where we were struggling for numbers.

Petr Cech&apos;s read &quot;Champion&quot;. Salomon Kalou showed off &quot;Victory&quot; and Frank Lampard &quot;Happiness&quot;, but the flashbulbs popped most as Fernando Torres held aloft &quot;Triumph&quot;. It is almost six months into the Spaniard&apos;s career as a Chelsea player but, still, the watching world seeks evidence that prising him from Liverpool constitutes a coup. The focus has fixed upon him from Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok to Hong Kong, much to the clear frustration of the manager, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas. At a club still considering how best to make waves in the transfer market this summer, the search for the Torres who rampaged over allcomers in his early days at Anfield remains the issue of the moment. To be under such scrutiny in pre-season is cruel, centred as it is on a forward who, like his team-mates, is still building up fitness and searching for finesse. None of Chelsea&apos;s tourists in the far east has dazzled and, even when pitted against weaker opposition, neither would they have expected to flourish. As public as they are, the fixtures played in Asia are warm-ups for a long campaign and the squad are still learning what is expected of them under Villas-Boas. This team are gearing up for the match at Stoke City next month, not the Premier League Asia Cup fixture with Kitchee on Wednesday afternoon. Yet the attention is inevitable nevertheless. So staggering was the \u00a350m outlay lavished to secure the World Cup winner, and so anticlimactic his impact over the last few months of Carlo Ancelotti&apos;s tenure, that doubt has festered. Before departing for Malaysia, Torres had heralded this &quot;a new start&quot;, claiming he was &quot;settled and happy, feeling sharper&quot;. But there was to be no welcome flurry of goals against a Malaysia XI or the Thailand All Stars to ease the nerves and confirm his revitalised state of mind. He will most likely start Wednesday&apos;s game on the bench with Didier Drogba to play an hour. Each scoreless or peripheral appearance, perhaps harshly, merely extends the hangover. Torres was asked whether he feared being unable to return to the prolific form of his early Liverpool days at the question and answer session prior to the training clinic in Hong Kong on Tuesday. &quot;I am 27,&quot; he replied. &quot;I don&apos;t forget [how] to score goals. I will score.&quot; Yet he still appears to be a figure in need of a reminder of his qualities. There are flashes of frustration, and desperation to succeed, in his play now that are to be expected. Yuri Zhirkov&apos;s sloppy delivery in one drill at the Hong Kong Stadium on Tuesday night prompted a livid reaction from the striker. He had been denied by the goalkeeper in Kuala Lumpur and had snatched at his clearest sight of goal in Bangkok. Had either chance been converted, a sense of relief would have settled in by now. Torres, however, still seems uncomfortable in this team. He is a forward who needs service to thrive, yet Chelsea still lack a creator through the middle \u2013 a Luka Modric to spark the forward line into life \u2013 or natural, teasing wingers out wide. Villas\u2011Boas prefers to concentrate on the qualities of the collective over the individual, but the fact that his transfer priority is to secure a playmaker is revealing. With the supply line inconsistent, Torres appears lonely, his body language exasperated at times. He is not a player who can muscle his way into a contest like Drogba. He revels more in gliding on to cleverly weaved passes, stretching defenders in the channels that are often occupied by team-mates. The process of Chelsea getting to know their record signing is still ongoing. There is at least a desire within the setup to coax the best from the World Cup winner. No one has given up on making this arrangement work. Torres, John Terry has insisted, is not toiling in the same way that Andriy Shevchenko, himself an eye\u2011catching \u00a330m signing from Milan, once did so protractedly at Stamford Bridge. &quot;Torres has been open about the injury he suffered at the World Cup,&quot; said the captain. &quot;Ideally he would have liked to have scored more goals than he did after joining us. But he&apos;s happy, he&apos;s settled. Naturally there&apos;s a bit of pressure on him, but he can deal with it. He&apos;s one of the best strikers in the world, after all, and is hungry to win.&quot; That hunger can yet be satisfied. There is time, still, yet for Torres to prove he really is the &quot;triumph&quot; his shirt proclaimed \u2013 a goalscoring start to the new season will reassure \u2013 but this is a striker who needs his luck to change. Four years ago, the Spaniard arrived in Hong Kong as a recently signed Liverpool player to be thrust into a debut against Portsmouth once international clearance had been granted. He promptly missed a penalty as Pompey claimed the trophy. &quot;A lot of things have happened since then,&quot; he said on Tuesday.

Lim was recently forced to deny the boast from Joe Sim that they were planning to buy an English club together after the latter bragged about it to undercover reporters on the Dispatches programme. Still, they do have at least one business link, since it is known that Sim leases the Bangkok outlet of the Manchester United Cafe franchise that is part of Lim&apos;s empire. Now the $10m (\u00a36.1m) Peter Lim Scholarship has been launched in his native Singapore, aimed at funding the coaching of young athletes who cannot afford to concentrate full\u2011time on their coaching development. It has gained the support of the former Manchester United captain Gary Neville, who spoke warmly of the &quot;huge commitment from Peter&quot; in the fund when in Singapore last month. Adding his voice to it was the United winger Nani, who gave a talk to scholars and gave lengthy interviews to local media at the Lim launch. Most intriguing is the involvement of the agent Jorge Mendes, who represents Nani, Beb\u00e9 and Cristiano Ronaldo and was last month involved in taking the goalkeeper David de Gea to Old Trafford. According to an interview in the Singaporean newspaper Today, Mendes has been engaged to take the fund&apos;s best players to European clubs. &quot;This is what Peter and I are talking about,&quot; said Mendes. According to the newspaper, Lim and Mendes have been friends for two years after &quot;moving in the same football circles with mutual friends such as the United manager [Sir] Alex Ferguson and the Real Madrid boss [Jos\u00e9] Mourinho.&quot; Whether the fund intends to retain third-party economic rights to the players it invests in will be interesting. Mendes could not be reached on Tuesday.

Another of that fund&apos;s key players is Neil Sillett, the son of Coventry City&apos;s FA Cup\u2011winning co-manager John Sillett. In one of his separately held interests, Sillett is upfront about his investment in indentured footballers. &quot;The underlying principle is straightforward: investors buy shares in the company, and the money raised is used to secure contractual rights on young footballers,&quot; a prospectus for Sillett&apos;s Sillsport Sports Development reads. Yet subscribing shareholders would be going in with their eyes open about the risks involved. &quot;It should be noted that investments into Sillsport Sports Development Ltd are not regulated by the Financial Services Authority nor are the investments covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme,&quot; it adds. &quot;There may not be a market to sell the shares were the company to be wound up. Future returns are not guaranteed and investors may receive back less than they originally invested.&quot; Boxing clever Perhaps the investment risk in taking stakes in players is not so great after all. Third-party involvement in player contracts is illegal in England under Premier League and Football Association rules. Overseas it is not outlawed, but Fifa&apos;s Transfer Matching System \u2013 the global electronic clearing house for cross-border deals \u2013 seeks to dissuade clubs from making third-party payments. Yet senior lawyers\u00a0in\u00a0the game believe the practice is rife even among clubs who say they do not hold any third-party contracts. Wouter Lambrecht, the head of legal affairs at the European Club Association that groups together the top clubs in the European game, said at the World Sports Law Report conference this month that the TMS safeguards against it are inadequate. He says there is evidence that clubs are pledging not to make third-party payments by ticking the relevant box in the TMS documentation but then do so anyway. &quot;A box is a box,&quot; said Isabelle Solal, TMS&apos;s head of integrity and compliance. &quot;It is something we can use as evidence that a club has lied. It is something that we plan to use going forward during investigations.&quot; Dope risk warning As the sprinter Bernice Wilson fights a positive drugs test for testosterone and clenbuterol, the government will warn every sports governing body on Wednesday that they are expected to guarantee British sport is drug free at London 2012. The sports minister, Hugh Robertson, has used the occasion of one year to go before the Olympics to write to the chief executives of all national bodies. His letter states: &quot;Any doping activity in the runup to, and during, the Olympic and Paralympic Games next year represents not only a significant reputational risk to the Games but also a risk to the UK in securing major sporting events in the future.&quot; He added: &quot;We will do our utmost to root out those involved in doping.&quot; The International Olympic Committee is set to ban needles from Olympic venues including the athletes&apos; village at 2012.", "publicationDate": "2011-07-26T22:00:00Z", "tags": ["Football", "Manchester United", "Business", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jul/26/peter-lim-gary-neville", "title": "Peter Lim's fund for young sports people is praised by Gary Neville", "sentences": ["Still, they do have at least one business link, since it is known that Sim leases the Bangkok outlet of the Manchester United Cafe franchise that is part of Lim&apos;s empire."]}, {"article": "Environment news \u2022 UK sails ahead in offshore wind power generation\u2022 US eco-activist jailed for two years\u2022 Electric car sales appear to slow despite government grants\u2022 Sea Shepherd could be forced to sell Steve Irwin in bluefin dispute\u2022\u00a0WWF accused of failing to regulate sustainable timber scheme On the blogs     Peter Walker heads off to work on the Pilen Lyx bike    \u2022 Can a different bike make you a different rider?\u2022 Planning law changes: the crux is defining &apos;sustainable development&apos;\u2022 Why the UK must choose renewables over nuclear: an answer to Monbiot\u2022 London 2012: How sustainable will the Olympics be?\u2022\u00a0Conservative MEPs get transparency - but not climate change Multimedia     A black-tufted marmoset looks from inside a cage after Thai police arrested a citizen of the United Arab Emirates at Suvarnabhumi airport in Bangkok May 13, 2011.

The &quot;snakes on a plane&quot; headlines have once again focused attention on Thailand as an international hub for the illegal trade in wildlife, a trade worth a staggering \u00a36bn a year. The arrest is the latest in a number of high-profile detentions at the Thai airport. However, local environmental organisations have expressed frustration that police enforcement remains inadequate to tackle a trade that is decimating local ecosystems, hastening the extinction of scores of endangered animals and plundering the resources of developing countries for profits abroad. In May, a passenger bound for Dubai was found to have a gibbon, an Asiatic black bear cub, a marmoset and four baby leopards in his carry-on baggage. Having got through the security checks he was reportedly only stopped after one of the leopards made a &quot;muffled cry&quot; at the departure gate. Other recent seizures also include a drugged tiger cub hidden among stuffed toy animals and three suitcases full of 200 live animals \u2013 containing everything from endangered tortoises to pythons, boa constrictors and a parrot. While superficially promising, these headline arrests actually reveal a deeper problem with law enforcement. The smugglers involved in these cases had not engaged in shadowy criminal networks to procure their animals, they had simply gone shopping in Bangkok&apos;s sprawling outdoor Chatuchak market. One local environmental organisation is so frustrated by this state of affairs that it has published an open letter questioning how &quot;wildlife can be openly sold every weekend&quot; just down the road from the offices of the Thai authorities who regulate the illegal trade. With rare native creatures, a large international airport and long land borders with its south-east Asian neighbours, Thailand is an attractive hub for both the import and export of rare animals. Live lizards, snakes and big mammals are increasingly in demand in the Middle East as exotic pets, while tiger bones and bear gall bladders are exported to China, Hong Kong and Singapore for use in Chinese medicine. Acres, which campaigns to stop the illegal wildlife trade, recently ran an undercover operation in Singapore which found tiger parts for sale at just under half of all jewellery and antiques shops visited. The organisation runs public awareness campaigns to challenge such cultural traditions \u2013 something that is essential in tackling the demand side of the trade. Thailand has also become a major importer in the illegal ivory trade, mostly from Africa. Ivory from domestic Thai elephants can be sold legally \u2013 so illegal ivory is taken to Thailand to be &quot;laundered&quot; into the legal domestic market. Thai customs have seized over 8.5 tons of ivory since 2009 \u2013 equating to more than 1,000 elephant tusks. Traffic, the global wildlife trade monitoring network, explains that Thailand now hosts the world&apos;s largest unregulated domestic ivory market, and argues that &quot;Thailand needs to close [this] domestic ivory loophole once and for all&quot;. Corruption and insufficient sentencing deterrents also create regulation difficulties. Freeland Foundation, an international conservation and human rights organisation based in Bangkok, has described official corruption as the biggest problem that it faces in tackling the trade. A recent example is the Dubai-bound passenger arrested with the four baby leopards. Immediately after his detention the police reported they had been politically pressured to not charge him. The smuggler&apos;s client was allegedly a Dubai prince with connections to influential Thai politicians. He was released on bail and promptly escaped the country. Freeland Foundation director Steven Galster remarked: &quot;Over the past six years we&apos;ve seen only one trafficker go to prison. And that was because the prosecutor [...] happened to be an animal lover.&quot; While police may make low-level arrests, those ultimately controlling the trade have repeatedly gone unpunished. A draft law to increase trafficking sentences was proposed eight years ago \u2013 but has still not passed. The Thai politician and human rights and environment activist Kraisak Choonhavan admits that previously, with &quot;so many urgent laws to consider, something like [a new] wildlife law just never saw the light of day&quot;. However, with the recent elections providing a large democratic mandate and signalling an end to the political instability of recent years, there is real potential for a new political emphasis on tackling the illegal trade in wildlife. Without this political will, Thailand and south-east Asia risk a massive and irreversible loss of biodiversity as natural resources continue to be plundered overseas.", "publicationDate": "2011-07-28T09:08:14Z", "tags": ["Endangered species", "Wildlife", "Environment", "Thailand", "World news", "Conservation", "Animals", "Singapore", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/28/illegal-wildlife-trade-snakes-plane-bangkok", "title": "Illegal wildlife trade is far more terrifying than just snakes on a plane | Andrew Chambers", "sentences": ["Last week, an Iranian man was stopped by customs officials trying to smuggle 50 live snakes on to a plane in Bangkok, hidden in rolled-up socks in his hand luggage.", "The smugglers involved in these cases had not engaged in shadowy criminal networks to procure their animals, they had simply gone shopping in Bangkok&apos;s sprawling outdoor Chatuchak market.", "Freeland Foundation, an international conservation and human rights organisation based in Bangkok, has described official corruption as the biggest problem that it faces in tackling the trade."]}, {"article": "If ever there was a film that required a second go, it was 2007&apos;s Ghost Rider. It promised so much \u2013 at least as much as a film about a man with a burning head riding a motorbike up a skyscraper can promise \u2013 but it was bungled at almost every turn. The antagonist \u2013 Blackheart \u2013 was transformed from a snarling reptilian demon into someone who looked like he should be playing bass for My Chemical Romance. Eva Mendes could have been replaced with a bra on a stick and all Nicolas Cage did was eat jellybeans and appreciate The Carpenters in a silly wig. But now it looks like we&apos;re getting the Ghost Rider we deserve in next year&apos;s Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. Last month&apos;s Comic-Con may have featured the likes of Spider-Man, Spielberg and Prometheus, but there was a sense that the sneak peek at the Ghost Rider sequel captured the most hearts. Here&apos;s why: The Crank connection The first Ghost Rider was written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson, a man probably best known for writing Jack Frost, in which Michael Keaton played a bad-tempered snowman who loves his human son. But Spirit of Vengeance is different. Spirit of Vengeance is directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, who made Crank. Ridiculous, breathless, demented, brilliant Crank. If Neveldine and Taylor can capture half the energy of Crank \u2013 or coax a performance from Cage that&apos;s anywhere near as preposterous as the one they coaxed from Jason Statham \u2013 then Ghost Rider 2 might be very special indeed. Nicolas Cage is still in it The directors claim that Ghost Rider 2 is more reboot than sequel, but at least Nicolas Cage will return as Johnny Blaze. He&apos;s made 11 films since Ghost Rider was released, ranging from the berserk sci-fi of Next and Knowing to the barmy action of Drive Angry and Bangkok Dangerous. It&apos;s like he&apos;s been training for this. What&apos;s more, after the CG incarnation of the first film&apos;s hero, this time Cage will be playing Ghost Rider himself. This can only be a good thing, especially since Cage has spoken of &quot;channeling a cobra&quot; for the role. And what&apos;s the only thing better than watching Nicolas Cage act? Watching Nicolas Cage act like a snake while he sets his head on fire and drives a motorbike a bit too fast, that&apos;s what. Cage wears a better wig Viewers of the first Ghost Rider might remember the terrible wig Nicolas Cage was forced to wear as Johnny Blaze. Short, pushed forwards and weirdly boyish, it looked like that unfortunate period in 1997 when Tony Blair had his hair cut to look more like Caesar. This time around, however, Cage&apos;s wig is swept-back and age appropriate. It might not be a big thing, but it&apos;s definitely an improvement. Idris Elba The inclusion of Idris Elba in a film isn&apos;t a guarantee of quality \u2013 you only have to look at the likes of Obsessed or 28 Weeks Later to realise that \u2013 but at least you can be sure of a decent performance. Elba even managed to turn a thankless mythological sentry role in Thor into something worth watching. What he&apos;ll do with the part of Moreau, a kickass, alcoholic biker monk from France, is anyone&apos;s guess. Early snippets More than anything, though, there&apos;s the early word on Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance to go on. And it sounds absolutely loopy. Empire saw footage at Comic-Con and witnessed Cage &quot;unleashing merry hell, spinning a baddie high up into the air on the end of a spectral chain, swallowing a hail of machine-gun fire and then spitting it back at some burly unfortunates, and, in one memorable shot, literally pissing fire&quot;. Neveldene and Taylor have said that &quot;you will see real bones breaking in Ghost Rider, not CG bones&quot;. The whole thing sounds completely berserk. If it does end in failure, it sounds as if it will be the sort of glorious failure you&apos;ll remember for years to come.", "publicationDate": "2011-08-04T11:29:11Z", "tags": ["Nicolas Cage", "Film", "Action and adventure", "Culture", "Science fiction and fantasy"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/aug/04/ghost-rider-spirit-vengeance", "title": "Why Ghost Rider deserves its reincarnation", "sentences": ["He&apos;s made 11 films since Ghost Rider was released, ranging from the berserk sci-fi of Next and Knowing to the barmy action of Drive Angry and Bangkok Dangerous."]}, {"article": "Apparently, when the Edinburgh festival was conceived during the 1940s, the idea was pitched at Oxford, too. I&apos;ve often wondered if that similarly noble city would be happy with the annual invasion of millions of eager punters and wide-eyed clowns, dripping with greasepaint, glitter and sweat. It must be strange to suddenly have the bus stop outside your house turned into venue 1064, and to have a merry flyerer dressed as Henry VIII at the end of your street. I chatted to a female cabbie last night about whether she liked the festival. I had asked to go to Buccleuch Street, which I pronounced &quot;Boocleeuuurgher&quot;. A silence ensued, after which she spat: &quot;It&apos;s Bucloo. It&apos;s\u00a0English.&quot; Rather than protest, I\u00a0nodded. &quot;Silly me! Of course, it&apos;s Bucloo. Why, only last week I queued to buy some bucloo pie.&quot; I hastily threw in that my dad&apos;s from Scotland, something I keep up my sleeve in case of an anti-English tirade.

Fforde is best known as the author of the bestselling Thursday Next series, in which he lays out the adventures of a literary detective who juggles her time between a counter-contemporary Swindon, in which dodos are house pets and the Crimean war has yet to end, and her travels into the world of fiction. Recently, however, he has turned his attention to writing for children, and published The Last Dragonslayer, a story of what happens when magic bumps up against government bureaucracy, at the end of last year.  He&apos;s in Edinburgh to talk about the latest volume in his Thursday Next series, One of Our Thursdays Is Missing \u2013 but will no doubt be happy to answer any questions you have to put to him. Log back in tomorrow to follow the chat at 3pm, but post your questions now. Here&apos;s the Q&amp;A. We&apos;ve added it above the line to make it easier to follow. Nolie15 asks: Has your view of time travel been influenced by Doctor Who and, being in Wales, do you associate with anyone involved with the show? Jasper Fforde replies: I don&apos;t have anything to do with it at all, I&apos;m afriad, and don&apos;t actually watch the show these days - although to be honest I was highly influenced as a child - it&apos;s interesting to note that Douglas Adams was with us before HHGG - he did tons of DW episodes. Interstingly, when I was explaining to my boys about the TARDIS when the show was first re-aried, I described ow it was bigger on the inside than the outside - they were nonplussed and told me: &apos;Pingu&apos;s house is like that&apos;. So. Pingu&apos;s houe is a TARDIS. vorpalblade asks: My first question to you: How do you write? (I hope the answer encompasses setting, psychological state and multitasking skills, but as long as the answer is truthful and witty....)My second question: [spoiler] Why the ascension of the Toast Marketing Board?! Toast is delicious, don&apos;t get me wrong, but pancakes/potato scones even more so.My third question: What are some of the best things that have happened to you as a direct consequence of writing your books? Jasper Fforde replies: (answer to first question)I simply sit down and start writing. I tend not to have a any plan, which I call the &apos;No plan plan&apos; which essentially means dreming up a few interesting threads or &apos;narrative dares&apos; and then attempting to weave them together into something resembling a plot. It&apos;s quite long winded and requires a lot of rewriting, but seems to work for me! (answer to second question)Toast has a delightfully random logic about it that says much about Thursday&apos;s world. Who would be promoting the eating of toast? Hovis? Morphy Richards? Hovis-Morphy-Richards, that well known vertically integrated multinational that needs to promote their product? It&apos;s not a plot deive with an answer - it&apos;s just silly for it&apos;s own sake. (answer to third question)Meeting people for whom the books have meant something special - met a partner, got them through finals, their last months of confinement or even, as mentioned to me today - got them thorugh a bad case of dyssentry in Nepal. foxinabox1988 asks: If you had to describe your written style in a maximum of 5 words to try and convince someone who&apos;s never read one of your books before to give them a go, which words would you choose? Jasper Fforde replies: &quot;Books for people who love stories, stories for people who love books.&quot;&quot;Don&apos;t ask, read it.&quot; Branfish asks: In the Nursery Crime books, it says that Lola Vavoom was in a film called The Eyre Affair. In the Nursery Crime universe, did Thursday Next exist and have the same (or similar) adventures to the ones in her own books, or is The Eyre Affair fictional in the Nursery Crime universe in the same way that the Nursery Crime books are fictional in the Thursday Next universe? Jasper Fforde replies: If you have a read of &apos;Well of lost plots&apos; you may realise that the NC books exist within the Bookworld to off character exchange programmes for bored characters. Lola Vavoom clearly likes to jump around the fictional world, and since there have been a lot of books written about her (mostly scurrilous fiction, I imagine) there are a lot of her about. RogueArgie asks: From Buenos Aires, Argentina, just wanted to let you know that down here we are living in one of your fictions.... can you please sort out a happy ending? we really need it, or at least a good unexpected twist... and, btw, thanks for all the fish! Jasper Fforde replies: I was in BA for six months during 1990 making &apos;Highlander II&apos; so have a huge affection for the nation, and have always maintained an interest. I was sorry to learn of recent problems, and would be delighted to write a fictional remedy - bt you have such good magical realism writers down there already, I think you will be fine... RolandKempston asks: Hi Jasper, How hard did you find it to bag an agent?Janklow and Nesbit seem to be cracking agency for far-fetched fiction (they have both you and Gideon Defoe on their books.) Would you recommend people who write in your genre (far-fetched-fiction) approach them?Thanks. Jasper Fforde replies: It took me ten years and seven books to bag an agent - it took me that long to start writing good. Agents and publishers only want one thig - good wrting. Approaches to either can be as simple as sending a great opening chapter with a post-it and an email address. If your work is arresting enough, it will catch their eye. Trouble is, making it good enough, and that&apos;s what takes time and effort. I thought my first book (the big over easy) was fab when I wrote it, but when it mysteriously failed to get an agent, I simply carried on writing. The truth as to why I wasn&apos;t picked up on BoE was revealed eleven years later when I dusted it off for publication - it wasn&apos;t that good. I rewrote it complelty for publication. Pobotrol asks: Hi Jasper! Your novels seem to have become far more structured than the earlier ones. Is that a concious decision to approach them in a more controlled way, or an improvement in your authorship skills? Or am I just imagining it? Jasper Fforde replies: Hopefully an improvement in my authoring skills. I&apos;m still trying to write something that will be a world-beater. I just need to be a bit better... Canocola asks: &quot;dysentery in Nepal&quot; - reminds me of the letter I wrote to Jeffrey Archer asking if he couldn&apos;t possibly ask his publisher to use softer paper... Q: How often do you find yourself explaining yet another obscure reference to your agent, and how often do you find yourself removing something because it&apos;s just that little bit too left-field? Jasper Fforde replies: Oddly, I don&apos;t have to that often. My editors kind of know me by now, and when they find something weird, they just assume it&apos;s an obscure in-joke about something and pass on without comment. For years my US editor had read my books with no knowledge of Star Wars, so the scene with an alien in the Bookworld who says: &apos;I have the death sentence in five genres&apos; made no sense to her. sadoldpenant says: Not actually a question -- just saying hi. I&apos;m unwilling to reveal my true identity, but to prove that I know you, or at least knew you once, I shall use the secret code word &quot;Wernos&quot;. (I&apos;m not actually sure the spelling is correct.) Glad to see you are doing so well. Jasper Fforde replies: Spelling is correct. Any other clues? Jannie4gold asks: As a mostly unpublished writer, I&apos;d just like to tell you that the Well of Lost Plots has brought me great comfort for many years, knowing that my poor rejected characters are still swanning around in there, living their lives. Thank you, thank you, thank you!! And I loved One of Our Thursdays is Missing. And now a proper question: One of the aspects of OoOTiM that I really admired was how, creatively, cleverly and humorously the landscape of the book reflected the changes in the publishing world, such as genre diversification, e-books and so on. I was wondering whether you anticipated right from The Eyre Affair that the environments Thursday inhabits would need to expand in that way, or whether you originally just envisaged her roaming ever deeper into the existing literary canon? Jasper Fforde replies: The fun one can have writing books about books is limitless, to be honest. However the publishing world goes, Thursday can follow. In Ooootim, you may note that I am writing books aout my own books, and how a fictional version of my real (but actually fictional) charater can have issues with being fictional. It&apos;s all very complicated, and perhaps reveals just how complex the storytelling process can be. Glad you liked TN3 - it&apos; one of my favourites from a &apos;strictly wacky ideas&apos; viewpoint. I think there&apos;s a plot in the somewhere, but I&apos;m not sure... Kaysto asks: I was glued to Shades of Grey, but when will there be a sequel? Jasper Fforde replies: I&apos;m hoping to write a sequel next year, after DS-3 &apos;Return of Shandar&apos;. The rest of this year will be taken up with TN-7 &apos;Dark Reading Matter&apos;. So hopefully Sog-2 will be published March 2013!! clickety6 asks: If you&apos;re relaxing (as if you have time!) which authors do you enjoy reading? Jasper Fforde replies: I just finised Michael Brook&apos;s &apos;&apos;13 things we don&apos;t kow about science&apos; (or similar title). Great stuff, and very enlightening not just about scientists but the curious habitat in which they live - a land of papers, periodicals and funding, which can be very damaging as it requires scientitts to sometimes overegg the cake to secure next year&apos;s cash. It also reveals just what we don&apos;t know, and roases the spectacle of what might be unknowable. &apos;How to be a woman&apos; by Caitlin Moran is hysterically funny, too, and I&apos;ve just listened to &apos;A walk in the woods&apos; by Bryson. All good fun, but not really fiction. Don&apos;t read so much of that these days. Not sure why. Saty asks: Having just read your workload it seems a bit churlish to ask but is there any tv program you would love to write an episide for ?I reckon you could do a good one for Futurama. Living in Caversham I would love the council to rename our street after you, I mean what has Tolstoy written recently ? Jasper Fforde replies: I always say yes to street names - there is a whole host of Thursday-themed streets in Swindon, which for that very reason alone puts me firmly on Swindon&apos;s side in the &apos;Swindon V Reading&apos; deal. If Reading want to name a steet after ME then I might fall the other side of the argument. Tv program? I&apos;d so love to be on the US writing teams that seem to work so well for their dramas and sitcoms. Not simply for me to write it, but to work in a room with other authors, all tossing stuff into the hat and then going off to do their bit. I worked very collaboratively in the film business for twenty years, so the idea appeals to me. Kaysto says: Couldn&apos;t you just slip in Shades of Grey 2 before the others? Jasper Fforde replies: Are you a plant for my publishers? Redz4ever asks: Just how much do you enjoy toast? Jasper Fforde replies: A lot. Quite often I have toast ON my toast. I like it that much. There are toast fast food joints in Bangkok, apparently. My favourite toast topping is probably marmalade, but sardines are good, too. ShaunDWilson asks: I had a lot of trouble explaining &apos;One of Our Thursdays is Missing&apos; to other people but had no difficulty in reading and following the logic. Was it hard to organise all the internal logic of the book in a way that could make sense to anyone but you? Jasper Fforde replies: It is complex, I admit - perhaps writing unexplainable books are my thing. Think how hard it was for my agent to sell it to my editor, then how hard it was for my editor to sell it to Hodder. We often sy: &apos;Don&apos;t ask, just read it&apos;, but that&apos;s no satisfactory, really. The internal logic of the Thursday world does make sense and I think that it is of huge importance to make the drama work. Most of the time I am setting Thursday thorugh an obstacle course that I have devised for her, which makes writing the books fascinating and frustrating all in one! Sometimes I get trapped by the logic myself, but sometimes I just go back and lower the obstacles a bit. It&apos;s one of the glories of working in Fantasy. tTime asks: Hi, I absolutely love your books, although sometimes they make me somewhat envious, too - wishing I could&apos;ve written them! Nearly fell off my chair reading about the Rocky Horror Hamlet... Question: how did you think of the character of Thursday Next - any paragons? Jasper Fforde replies: I liked the Rocky Horror, too. A slutary lesson in how to his exposition! By reading about the show, it tells us a lot about Thurday&apos;s world. Hmm. Thursday. I thought long and hard about where she came from, and I like to think of her as a pre-movement feminist, based on the pioneering women aviators of the Golder Years of Aviation - people like Bessie Coleman, Amelia Earhart and Amy Johnson, who just jumped in a plane and flew to the eqivelent of Pluto in something that would be considered dangerously unairwothy today. A sort of dauntless spirit, really - but I like in Thursday a sense of moral rectitude that she possesses without even knowing that she has it, or why. rachelkj asks: Why did you decide to make the written Thrusday the start of OOOTIS as opposed to &quot;real world Thursday&quot;? Also, I have to say that I love love love your Jack Spratt novel&apos;s. I think The last spark of orginally found its way to you after it was used for to help the ones who were known as ibb and obb. Jasper Fforde replies: It was based on the title, really. One of our Thursdays is missing, and someone has to find her. I think because I liked the earlier, slightly hesitant Thursday who was unsure of the Bookworld, I wanted to use that version of Thursday, and the written Thursday, trying to keep her book together in the spectre of being remaindered, seemed just the ticket. I could also do something I&apos;d wanted to do for a while - In TN2 I had a real person confused in the Bookworld. In TN6 I had a fictional person confused in the real world. I think perhaps the real world is weirder... Okay, I&apos;ve got to go and prepare for my next event now, so thanks for all your questions, and also for reading my books.

The Swansea unit is a stark, charcoal-grey box broken up by vividly coloured banquettes. My food arrived on a square pink plastic plate. Luckily, that is where the wackiness ends. All the flavours were present and correct in a sample beef Panang: the savoury peanut base note, an almost caramelised sweetness in the sauce, that distinctive coconut creaminess, hints of lemongrass, lime leaves and fish sauce. Yet, it is still hot enough to leave a tingle on the lips. For \u00a35.50 (lunch menu), it&apos;s a steal.

It serves several real ales, including one gravity-dispensed straight from the barrel behind the bar. Those used to a creamy head on their pint may balk at from-barrel beer, but a sample pint of Otley&apos;s Colombo 04 (\u00a32.90) was full of fresh, flourishing hop flavours. Food-wise, this busy, convivial boozer prides itself on honest, home-cooked pub grub. The menu runs to things such as fajitas and sweet &apos;n&apos; sour chicken, but you are probably better sticking to the simple stuff: that week&apos;s pie or curry, the chilli or bolognese. A plate of goulash (\u00a34.99) served with a huge mound of perfect rice delivered the required fruity paprika and tomato flavours, the beef was tender and plentiful, and there was a little pot of sour cream on the side to add that stir-through unctuousness. It may not have cut the mustard in Vienna or Budapest, but on a Friday night in Swansea it was perfectly satisfactory. The Brunswick offers unfussy, tasty food. Something many gastropubs often fail to deliver at twice the price.\u2022 Sandwiches and snacks from \u00a31.99, mains \u00a33.95-\u00a35.99. 3 Duke Street, 01792 465676, brunswickswansea.com One Shoe Cafe     f    Holbrook&apos;s, in Swansea town centre (28 Union Street, 01792 477797, holbrooksonline.co.uk), makes a lot of fuss about its coffee. However, I found a sample espresso a little thin and its &quot;infamous&quot; ham and scrambled egg breakfast toastie (\u00a33.85) OK but unremarkable.

Moreover, it serves decent coffee \u2013 rich, winey espressos, magnificently creamy cappuccinos \u2013 good bacon butties at breakfast, great homemade cakes (Friday&apos;s limited-edition brownies fly out of the door), and interesting panini, such as its &quot;Pablo&quot;, filled with chorizo, olives, red pesto and cream cheese.\u2022 Breakfast items from \u00a31, sandwiches from \u00a32.20. 1 King Edward Road, 07543 439595 Swansea Pie Who knew? That Swansea has its own pie? An individual, deep-filled creation of minced beef and onion in a rich, beefy gravy. It is just the thing to fortify you before 90 freezing minutes at the Liberty Stadium in November. Indeed, there is a traditional baker&apos;s near the stadium, Saunders \u2013 which I didn&apos;t get to (85 Pentre Treharne Road) \u2013 that reputedly does a good Swansea. Of the two I tried, Reed&apos;s (\u00a31.10, 231 Oxford Street) had the meatier, chunkier filling \u2013 a serious lava flow of salty, beefy flavour \u2013 but slightly greasy pastry, while a sample from the Gower Pasty Company (\u00a31.95 Bryn-y-mor Road, Uplands, gowerpasty.com) had a better, crisper pastry and, possibly, the more refined flavour. The filling, though, was a little thin. As the name suggests, the Pasty Co (so popular I had to go back next day, having found it largely sold out on Friday afternoon) also sells upmarket pasties from producers around the country. Its signature lamb pasty \u2013 made in Newquay, to the shop&apos;s own recipe \u2013 was reasonably good, for \u00a32.50. The rather scraggy pieces of lamb, however, failed to assert their flavour among a potato and vegetable filling seasoned with rosemary and pepper. The Pasty Co recently bought into a local flock of sheep, who will be shortly making an appearance in said pasties, and may well improve their flavour. Swansea Market     hjy    These days, most indoor markets are sad, tatty places. Not Swansea&apos;s. It is packed with stalls doing a reasonably brisk trade. In one corner, you&apos;ll find an enclave of butchers, delicatessen and food stalls, including a cluster selling plump, briny Gower cockles and fresh laverbread. Samples from Carol Watts (both from \u00a32 a tub; stall CR1 &amp; 2) failed to persuade me around to the latter. Laverbread, a dark green seaweed mush, is iron-rich and vegetal to a quite confrontational degree. With all due respect to local tastes, Wales can keep it. The Welsh cakes from Karen Evans&apos; stall (30p each; 55D) \u2013 half-scone, half-biscuit, still warm from the griddle, moist in the middle and dusted with sugar \u2013 are far more appetising. As are the curries (\u00a33-\u00a35; 58D) at Punjabi Tiffin. Its crisp, light, sweetly spicy potato and pea samosas (65p each) are fantastic.\u2022 Oxford Street, 01792 654296, swanseaindoormarket.co.uk Rose Indienne First, a public information announcement. The \u00a35.95 business lunch listed on the website is no longer offered. Perhaps Rose Indienne \u2013 a smart modern curry house with capable cooking to match \u2013 should reintroduce it. I was the only person eating here at 1pm on a Friday. No matter. You can still eat for under \u00a310 a head from the main menu, particularly if you stick to the chicken and vegetarian dishes. A sample rogan josh was full of toothsome, yielding lamb in a deeply savoury, tomato-sweetened sauce, enlivened by fresh herbs and bursts of aromatic, freshly ground spice. When I passed Rose Indienne on Friday night, it was much busier. Justifiably so.\u2022 Mains from \u00a35.50, rice/naan bread from \u00a31.70. 73-74 St Helens Road, 01792 467000, roseindienne.co.uk Govinda&apos;s     d    &quot;The killing of animals shows a great lack in spiritual awareness,&quot; insists a pamphlet at this vegetarian/vegan Hare Krishna-run cafe. Govinda&apos;s veggie burger is unlikely to persuade the committed carnivore to the path of righteousness (it&apos;s too mushy), but the eggless mayo is surprisingly good, as is the house tomato chutney, and the lentil and nut burger has a pleasantly mushroomy flavour. Elsewhere, the short menu includes daily hot vegetarian dishes (moussaka, aubergine bake, vegetable pie, pasta dishes), kofta and hummus wraps, dahls and pizza.

The Cascarini family has the local Italian gelato scene locked down. However, from this trip&apos;s one-off taste-test, I have to say I prefer Verdi&apos;s gelato. A sprawling glass beachfront cafe-complex further around Swansea Bay, in Mumbles, Verdi&apos;s also comprises a takeaway coffee and ice-cream kiosk. The coffee is unremarkable, but the numerous sorbets and ice-creams, made fresh each day using local milk and cream, are great. A sampler of lemon sorbet was sound, a little too ingratiatingly sweet, perhaps, but the apple crumble ice-cream was sensational: lustrously thick and creamy, yet light, its flavours true and clean. None of which is a slight against Joe&apos;s, particularly. Joe&apos;s ice-cream is perfectly nice, but it didn&apos;t, for me, quite hit the heights. Do the taste-test yourself: there&apos;s a Joe&apos;s parlour just a couple of hundred metres from Verdi&apos;s (526 Mumbles Road, joes-icecream.co.uk).\u2022 Ice-creams from \u00a31.35. Knab Rock, Mumbles, verdis-cafe.co.uk The Kitchen Table Housed in a former pottery shop, and decorated with artsy-crafty bric-a-brac, Anna and Adam Robertson&apos;s Mumbles cafe-restaurant is a firmly on-message modern foodie experience. Its menu is founded on great local and Welsh ingredients, from Halen M\u00f4n sea salt to Tomos Watkin&apos;s beers, brewed in Swansea. It&apos;s well-known for its vegetarian dishes, but meat-eaters are ably provided for, too. The Welsh beef steak burger is of reasonably good quality, but it is really lifted by the accompanying red onion and tomato salsa, and an unusually interesting side-salad topped with a luxuriously creamy dollop of homemade coleslaw. At \u00a37.80, it might sound toppy, but good ingredients cost and it comes with a generous portion of skin-on saut\u00e9ed potatoes. It is a full meal. While the Table is open at night, it is more expensive, two courses costing \u00a314.50.\u2022 Breakfast \u00a31.50-\u00a37.50, (daytime menu) sandwiches/salads, \u00a33.50-\u00a36.80, mains \u00a37.80. 626 Mumbles Road, 01792 367616, thekitchentablecafe.co.uk So Cocoa As a listing in a budget eating feature, So Cocoa is of limited practical use, but, blimey, it tastes good. A gourmet chocolatier, hidden up a side street in Mumbles, it also has a sideline in superb homemade and local, artisan-produced cakes. The pastry on its citron tart doesn&apos;t so much melt as magically evaporate in the mouth. There are whopping whoopie pies, great brownies and, a little less impressively, serviceable carrot cake. My advice? Buy some cakes, grab a takeaway coffee elsewhere, find a bench down on the seafront, and enjoy. And if you&apos;re not hungry, buy a cake for later.

A fish &apos;n&apos; chip shop since the back end of the first world war, its wonderful vintage interior dates to 1960s, while the menu - whatever happened to faggots, peas and gravy? - likewise tips its hat to tradition. Prices are keen (they haven&apos;t changed in three years), the owner is enthusiastic, and Park enjoys a fierce local following. Trouble is, my meal was only 50% good. &quot;Best chips in town,&quot; the bloke behind me in the queue advised, and I can certainly believe it. The chips were top-notch. The batter on the cod, however, was too thick (or the frying oil not hot enough) and it was still gooey inside. Was this an uncharacteristic error on Park&apos;s part?

If you&apos;re short of time you can fly there in just three hours from the UK with British Airways (ba.com, from \u00a3206 return for next summer) but it&apos;s more fun to go by train: buy an InterRail pass (interrail.net, from \u00a3155 for a month) and head to Montenegro, then take a bus or taxi across the border into Albania. Spend a few days in Tirana enjoying the sights and edgy nightlife in the Blloku area, then head north for mountains where boar, lynx and wolves roam, or south for golden beaches which have largely escaped mass tourism. The seaside towns of Dhermi and Drymades are popular with backpackers, offering budget hotels and kayaking in clear Ionian waters.

Year out itineraries Central America In many ways this is the perfect backpacker destination. It&apos;s small enough that you can travel overland from one country to the next without having to blow your budget on expensive flights, and large enough to get lost in if you feel the need to escape your fellow travellers. A popular route is to start in Mexico City and weave your way by bus down through Oaxaca, the Mayan ruins of the Canc\u00fan peninsula, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, finishing in Costa Rica. Popular backpacker stop-offs include Antigua in Guatemala, a preserved colonial city with budget accommodation, internet cafes and Spanish schools; San Pedro La Laguna on Lake Atitl\u00e1n, which has been colonised by hippies and backpackers who never left; and the laid-back island of Roat\u00e1n in Honduras, a cheap and popular place to learn to scuba dive. But if you want to get off the gringo trail there are plenty of unexplored corners, such as the Corn Islands of Nicaragua with their pristine beaches and Carib culture. With a smattering of Spanish it&apos;s easy enough to travel independently, but if you want a little local back-up, sign up for the Bamba Experience (bambaexperience.com), a hop-on hop-off bus service that offers dozens of itineraries in the region using public transport and private vans, with optional side trips.

Photograph: Alamy    South-east AsiaA fabulous choice of flights and a favourable exchange rate make South-east Asia an excellent destination for first-time travellers but the well-trodden route through Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam can feel like a gap year conveyor belt. Avoid this with an alternative Asian route that takes in the less obvious, but equally rewarding highlights of the Phillipines, Indonesia, Malaysia and even Burma. &quot;We&apos;re seeing a lot more demand for Malaysia and Borneo, and Burma, really seems to be opening up,&quot; says Samantha Harrison of Round the World Experts. One itinerary could be to start in Bangkok and travel south by bus or train into Malaysia. From there you can either take a trip up into the highlands to the mountain villages or take a boat to the Perhentian islands. From Kuala Lumpur, you can get a flight to Borneo for as little as \u00a330. You could spend up to four weeks there exploring the rainforest, helping out at the orang-utan sanctuary, climbing Mount Kinabalu or diving the clear waters off the isle of Sipadan.

The cheapest place to fly to, according to Journey Latin America (journeylatinamerica.co.uk), is Caracas, in Venezuela.

For all Lord Coe&apos;s abilities as an athlete and administrator, he is not a natural raconteur, but the bigger problem is that this programme has become cliche unto itself. Coe enacts every rite of the format, fossicking through photos and talking to genealogists, digging up a couple of vaguely interesting ancestors. The focus narrows to Coe&apos;s long-ago heritage among the sugar aristocracy of Jamaica, yielding a Caribbean holiday for Coe and a potted history of the slave trade for us.

But the biggest gaps we&apos;ve found this far come from Germany. &quot;I&apos;d wager that Berlin&apos;s Hertha Berlin and FC Union would have spent a fair amount of time without playing against each other whilst the Berlin Wall was up,&quot; writes James Straughan. &quot;And due to Union&apos;s lowly status, they wouldn&apos;t have played each other, certainly in a competitive game, for some considerable time after unification.&quot; Indeed, when the sides met at Union&apos;s Stadion An Der Alten F\u00f6rsterei in K\u00f6penick on 17 September 2010 in the 2 Bundesliga, it was billed as the clubs&apos; first ever meeting, although the teams had met in the Berlin regional league in 1949-50 before the wall went up. FC Union then went under the name of Union Obersch\u00f6neweide and took on their modern moniker in 1966, so it&apos;s either a 60-year gap or a 44-year gap depending on your historical bent. More on the game (a 1-1 draw) can be found here. Berlin isn&apos;t the only German city whose football teams have lived separate lives for half a century. There were no walls in the way but over in Frankfurt, FSV and Eintracht last played each other in the Oberliga S\u00fcd in 1961-62 (Eintracht winning 5-0 and 4-0) before FSV dropped down into the regional lower tiers of German football. That is, until four days ago when, with Eintracht now in the second tier, the teams finally met once more. &quot;Interestingly, Eintracht played the game at their own stadium, despite it being an away fixture&quot; writes J\u00f6rg Michner. &quot;FSV&apos;s stadium is too small, so the club rented the World Cup stadium in Frankfurt where Eintracht normally play their home games.&quot; Despite the 48-year wait little changed for FSV \u2013 Eintracht ran out 4-0 winners. Any more for any more? Let us know at the usual address. A HOME FROM HOME (2) Last week we looked at a few players who have played home games for the same side at several grounds, with Shamrock Rovers&apos; Derek Treacy topping the list with six different venues. Dale Farrington, though, has been in touch with details of several players to have played at seven home grounds for Thailand&apos;s Chonburi FC: &quot;There are a number of players \u2013 including Sinthaweechai Hathairatanakool, Pipob On-Mo, Suree Sukha and Ekaphan Inthasen \u2013 who have played competitive games at seven different home grounds whilst with Chonburi FC,&quot; he begins. &quot;In 2006 and 2007 the club used the Chonburi Municipal Stadium before moving to the Princess Srindhorn Stadium midway through the 2008 season. We relocated again in 2010, when we played at the Chonburi Sports College Stadium. At the beginning of this year, the Thai club moved to another new ground called simply The Chonburi Stadium. &quot;The team has also used the Supachalasai Stadium and Rajamangala Stadium \u2013 both in Bangkok \u2013 for AFC Champions League and AFC Cup home matches. &quot;In 2009 a Thai Premier League match against Muang Thong United was moved to Nong Prue Stadium near Pattaya as our own pitch was waterlogged. Also in 2009, the TPL ordered us to play our final league fixture at Supachalasai, following crowd trouble at the previous home game.&quot; MICHAEL OWEN VS TAS COSKUN During the 1998 World Cup I remember hearing in the playground (granted, never the most reliable source) that Michael Owen was the first player to play at a World Cup whose age (18) was lower than the number on his shirt (20),&quot; recalls Patrick Rennie. &quot;Can you confirm or deny this slightly bizarre rumour?&quot; Well Patrick, we can certainly deny it. Those playground sages were probably not old enough to remember young Tas Coskun. The first player to achieve this hugely prestigious honour was the 19-year-old Turkey forward, who in 1954 \u2013 the first time squad numbers were used at a World Cup \u2013 faced West Germany in a first round group stage play-off wearing the No23 shirt. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;Carlos Vela has now scored four goals for Arsenal to add to his 10 goals in Spain and he&apos;s not 20 until March,&quot; wrote Warren Yates back when a certain Mexican striker was the next big thing (the autumn of 2008, if you&apos;re wondering). &quot;I&apos;m sure he&apos;s not even close, but who&apos;s the highest-scoring teenager in football?&quot; Well, not to put too fine a point on it Warren, but you&apos;re damn right he&apos;s not close. He&apos;s not in the ball park, not even in the same solar system. We&apos;ve had myriad suggestions from you, beloved readers, and we&apos;ve dug out a few of our own. Nicolas Mercado suggests Ronaldo, who bagged 63 goals as a teenager with Cruzeiro and PSV Eindhoven and one more in the three matches he played for Barcelona before his 20th birthday. Jaime Alonso suggests Real Madrid&apos;s Ra\u00fal, who scored 49 goals in his first three seasons, having made his debut as a 17-year-old. Closer to home, Theo Walcott currently has 19 with Arsenal, Southampton and England. Jermain Defoe scored 20 goals as a teenager and Wayne Rooney 40, but the young Michael Owen comfortably tops all his Premier League contemporaries with 53. Stuart Gardner reckons Jimmy Greaves is in with a shout of the English title. He is the youngest player to 100 goals, scoring No100 against Manchester City on November 19 1960 at the age of 20 years and 261 days. Unless he had a prolific 262 days from his 20th birthday, it&apos;s safe to assume Greaves outstrips Owen. Unfortunately we&apos;re struggling to get an exact tally for his days as a teenager. Dixie Dean scored 62 goals in his first four seasons and was on his way to a further 36 in the following 1926-27 season when he turned 20 in January. As with Greaves, it is difficult to get an exact figure. Two names stand head-and-shoulders above the melee, however. &quot;Der Bomber&quot; Gerd Muller had scored 122 goals for TSV 1861 N\u00f6rdlingen and Bayern Munich by the time he turned 20, although even he pales into insignificance against the great Pele. &quot;Even if you exclude friendly games, I can&apos;t imagine anyone scoring more teenage goals than Pele, who scored 191 league goals and two international goals for Brazil by April 1960, still six months before he reached 20,&quot; writes Stuart Goodacre. &quot;And according to Fifa, which recognises friendly matches in its tallies, Pele scored 341 goals before turning 20.&quot; And if friendly matches count then an honourable mention should go to Josef &apos;Pepi&apos; Bican. Born in 1913, he had scored close to 250 goals by the end of the 1933-34 season, according to the RSSSF. Looks like Vela better get his skates on.

In their second match they wore their yellow second kit. In their third match they wore their maroon third kit, then on Saturday against Hereford they at last wore their first choice blue and yellow kit. Is four different kits in four matches a record?&quot; &quot;I ended up on a wiki-tangent the other day and found out about the Forfarshire Cup,&quot; writes Tom Clough. &quot;a) In 1884-85 the cup final was drawn 1-1, then subsequent replay was won 15-1. Is this some sort of record for a replayed match? b) The cup started 1883, but (according to wiki) Forfarshire was formally disbanded as a geographic region in 1889 but the cup continues with the same name. Are there any other precedents for competitions starting on geographic regions, but continuing after dissolution. c) Attendance in the Forfarshire cup final has dropped from 10-12k (1884) to 353 (2009)\u2026 a drop of more than 96%.

Cases involving the offence \u2013 which carries a sentence of up to 15 years in jail \u2013 have soared in the last five years. Thailand also blocked or suspended almost 75,000 sites between 2007 and 2010, mostly under computer crimes legislation in relation to l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9. Campaigners hoped the new government would ease restrictions, particularly given the complaints filed against several leaders of the &quot;red shirt&quot; movement whose support brought Puea Thai to power. But following pressure from the ousted Democrats, deputy prime minister Chalerm Yubamrung pledged to set up a &quot;war room&quot; to deal with the issue online, the Bangkok Post reported. &quot;Websites [guilty of l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9] will not be tolerated by this government. I will take action as quickly as possible,&quot; he said. The issue&apos;s increasing sensitivity comes amid the ill health of the revered 83-year-old king and the bitter political conflict between Thai elites, such as the powerful military, and supporters of Thaksin Shinawatra, ousted as prime minister in a 2006 coup. His sister, Yingluck, now leads the country and Puea Thai is seen as his party. David Streckfuss, the leading expert on the issue and author of Truth on Trial in Thailand, said 30 l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 charges were sent to the lower courts in 2006, 164 in 2009 and 478 in 2010. Multiple charges are often heard in single cases. The l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law says anyone who defames, insults or threatens the king, queen, heir apparent or regent should be punished with three to 15 years in prison, but does not define what constitutes such behaviour. &quot;It has become conflated with any criticism of the institution,&quot; said Streckfuss, who drew a parallel with McCarthyism. &quot;It&apos;s the easiest, most vague and ambiguous shot at people.&quot; Earlier this month 22-year-old student blogger Norawase Yospiyasathien was charged. Other cases causing particular alarm include those of Somsak Jiamteerasakul, a historian who proposed reforms to the monarchy; Thai-born American citizen Joe Gordon, whose blog linked to a banned book on the king; and webmaster Chiranuch Premchaiporn, accused of not deleting user comments deemed to insult the king quickly enough. Chiranuch&apos;s trial under the computer crimes act resumes next month, and police could yet act on a separate complaint under the l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law. She faces up to 50 years in jail, though sentences are often reduced after conviction. &quot;We can&apos;t deny any more that there is a problem,&quot; said Chiranuch, who runs the independent Prachathai news site. &quot;There&apos;s strong evidence that, with the political conflict, this law has been abused.&quot; Hundreds of scholars, lawyers, writers and activists have joined calls for reform of the law. They stress they are not questioning the monarchy, but the way the l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 provision has been used. &quot;[People] are using it as a political tool to destroy their enemies,&quot; Worachet Pakeerut, a law professor at Thammasat University, told Associated Press last month. Proposals include reducing the maximum sentence and allowing only an official royal body to register complaints. At present, anyone can; the royal family itself has never done so. Some advocates of reform point to comments the king made in 2005, saying it would be &quot;problematic&quot; if people were unable to criticise him.&quot;I said [reform] would not be as easy as a change in the government,&quot; said Chiranuch. &quot;It is quite clear the former government have put pressure on the new one by pushing them to promise not to amend the law.&quot; Some believe Chalerm made the announcement so Puea Thai could concentrate on other priorities. Others hope the tough rhetoric might help it avoid tough action. &quot;It may be that Mr Chalerm was merely being overzealous in trying to assure the Puea Thai government&apos;s loyalty to the monarchy, but it is ironic because of the many accusations that the l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law was used by the previous government to persecute some of the party&apos;s loyal supporters,&quot; the Bangkok Post noted in an editorial on Sunday. &quot;Brutal shutdown of l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 sites by the Yingluck administration is not the right way to win the heart and mind and protect the institution,&quot; warned the red-shirt-aligned Ratchaprasong News in a tweet.", "publicationDate": "2011-08-29T16:15:19Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/29/thailand-crackdown-insults-royal-family", "title": "Thailand cracks down on 'insults' to royal family", "sentences": ["But following pressure from the ousted Democrats, deputy prime minister Chalerm Yubamrung pledged to set up a &quot;war room&quot; to deal with the issue online, the Bangkok Post reported.", "&quot;It may be that Mr Chalerm was merely being overzealous in trying to assure the Puea Thai government&apos;s loyalty to the monarchy, but it is ironic because of the many accusations that the l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law was used by the previous government to persecute some of the party&apos;s loyal supporters,&quot; the Bangkok Post noted in an editorial on Sunday."]}, {"article": "As they powered down the aircraft on the tarmac of Barcelona&apos;s El Prat international airport, the personnel disembarking from a sleek Gulfstream jet would have looked little different from the other tired and hungry aircrew passing through. But as they took off the next morning for Washington on the final leg of a curious odyssey, a glance at their recent layovers \u2013 Riyadh, Amman, Bucharest \u2013 would have given a clue: this was no ordinary plane. According to documents that have emerged from a seemingly obscure legal squabble in upstate New York, the jet, Gulfstream N85VM, formed an integral part of the fleet of private aircraft that helped the CIA to run its clandestine programme of extraordinary rendition after the 9/11 attacks. The records offer an unprecedented insight not just into the movements of the Gulfstream jet, but also into how the rendition programme was subject to a culture every bit as corporate as other initiatives undertaken by a US administration keen on outsourcing the affairs of state to the private sector. Cheaply, if possible. &quot;They were trying to control their funding or their spending, and they wanted the cheapest aircraft to fulfil a mission,&quot; said Don Moss, the owner of the aircraft broker Sportsflight, which arranged for another company to put the aircraft at the service of Dyncorp, a private military company acting on behalf of the CIA. Moss made the remark during cross-examination in a New York court case generated by a legal dispute between his company and Richmor Aviation Inc, which initiated the proceedings to recover payment it claimed it was owed. The Gulfstream IV executive jet was made available at a cut-rate $4,900 (about \u00a33,000) an hour. Crew members were paid $800 a day, according to invoices submitted to the hearing. They would submit expenses claims for meals  (pdf) \u2013 deli sandwiches at $19.95 a time, bottles of wine at $39.95 each \u2013 and stay in expensive hotels: $391 a head for one night&apos;s stay in Barcelona in January 2004, for example; $277 each for accommodation at Shannon on the west coast of Ireland the following August. Before each flight an administrative officer at the US department of state would hand over a &quot;to whom it may concern&quot; letter (pdf) which made clear that their mission offered &quot;global support to US embassies worldwide&quot;. They were warned, however, that they needed to provide detailed explanations on their invoices, as Dyncorp &quot;operate very much like the government&quot; and would reject any claims considered too vague. Despite the attempts to keep costs down, the invoices submitted to the court as evidence show that some rendition operations were eye-wateringly expensive. In November 2002, for example, Gulfstream N85VM made a six-day round trip from Washington, taking in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Shannon, Dubai, Kabul, and Edinburgh (pdf). Richmor&apos;s bill was for $240,643 and 95 cents, including catering, landing fees and the cost of an additional crew member. Another operation that month, which saw the Gulfstream fly from Washington to Kabul via Shannon and Dubai, (pdf) and return via Dubai and Luton, north of London, resulted in a bill from Richmor for $198,930 and 30 cents. Bizarrely, given the purpose of the flights, Richmor was expected to meet US federal regulations, meaning rendition aircraft (pdf) were designated as drug-free workplaces, to be operated only by companies that took affirmative action to employ workers with disabilities. The real value of the documents is the way they allow the most comprehensive and verifiable picture to date of the CIA&apos;s so-called &quot;ghost planes&quot; to be mapped out. In the past, White House administrations under both George W Bush and Barack Obama have moved to ensure that details of the programme did not leak out from court proceedings. However, a lawyer who acted for Richmor&apos;s president, Mahlon Richards, told the Guardian that there was no such intervention on this occasion. &quot;What happened here was that Richmor Aviation entered into a contract with Sportsflight to provide rendition flights for detainees and after I got involved in it and I saw the various invoices from Richmor that were submitted to Sportsflight it was amazing to me that no one from the United States government ever said boo to me about any of this,&quot; said William Ryan, of the law firm Tabner, Ryan and Keniry. &quot;So I just went about prosecuting the case for the client.&quot; Jeffrey Heller, a lawyer at the firm Somer and Heller, which acted for Sportsflight, said that it was &quot;nothing more than an air travel broker&quot;. &quot;I don&apos;t believe that Don Moss had any knowledge, specifically in advance, of what these flights were going to entail,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t think they knew there was going to be these rendition flights. &quot;Sportsflight brokered the contract and then brokers the availability of air travel, so Richmor then has these planes ready and then the government agency goes directing to Richmor to book these flights, so Sportsflight is kind of out of it. They don&apos;t necessarily know where it&apos;s going, when and who is getting on.&quot; Gulfstream N85VM has already been identified as the aircraft that rendered Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr, an Egyptian cleric known as Abu Omar, after CIA agents kidnapped him in broad daylight in Milan in February 2003 and took him to Cairo. Through close examination of the invoices it is possible to identify other rendition flights in which a number of high-profile al-Qaida suspects may have been rendered. In August 2003, for example, Richmor submitted an invoice for $301,113 for eight flights over three days that took the Gulfstream to Bangkok, via Alaska and Japan, on to Kabul via Sri Lanka, and then home again via Dubai and Shannon (pdf). This operation appears to have been the rendition of Encep Nuraman, the leader of the Indonesian terrorist organisation Jemaah Islamiyah, better known as Hambali. He had been captured in Thailand shortly before the aircraft set off. The court heard that in October 2004 the aircraft&apos;s tail number was changed to N227SV after the US government discovered that its movements were being tracked. The following March the aircraft was publicly linked to the Abu Omar rendition. Phillip Morse, the aircraft&apos;s ultimate owner, said he was stunned to discover how his plane was being used. Later that year, businessmen involved in the rendition programme spotted a new opportunity after a number of companies that operated the CIA&apos;s own fleet of aircraft \u2013 which also operated rendition flights \u2013 were exposed in the US media as agency front operations. Moss wrote to Mahlon Richards at Richmor: &quot;This has changed the whole posture of the end user, to the extent they are reluctant to operate their own aircraft (pdf) and have elected to ground certain equipment indefinitely. We hope this can be to our benefit.&quot; But the happy days of deli sandwiches, $40 wine and $4,900-an-hour fees were about to come to an end. As a result of media investigations around the world and parliamentary inquiries in Europe, the truth about the rendition programme \u2013 and the fate of its victims \u2013 was slowly becoming clear. Soon Morse and his family were reluctant to climb aboard their own jet. &quot;They were afraid to fly in their aircraft because of all the publicity about their particular airplane,&quot; Richards told the court. Italian investigators began an investigation into the kidnap of Abu Omar that ultimately resulted in the conviction of 23 Americans, all but one of them CIA agents, who were tried in their absence. Two Italian intelligence officers were also convicted. The former head of the CIA in Milan, Robert Lady, was given an eight-year jail sentence. By October 2006, Richards was writing to Moss to complain that his company was suffering negative publicity (pdf), losing business and receiving hate mail. The Gulfstream&apos;s crews were afraid to leave the country. &quot;In the future, whenever the name &apos;Richmor&apos; is googled this will come up. N227SV will always be linked to renditions. No tail number change will ever erase that and our requests for government assistance in this matter have been ignored.&quot; Additional reporting by Sarika Bansal", "publicationDate": "2011-08-31T20:35:00Z", "tags": ["Rendition", "CIA", "US news", "World news", "US foreign policy", "September 11 2001"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/31/cia-rendition-flights-cost", "title": "Mundane bills bring CIA's rendition network into sharper focus", "sentences": ["In August 2003, for example, Richmor submitted an invoice for $301,113 for eight flights over three days that took the Gulfstream to Bangkok, via Alaska and Japan, on to Kabul via Sri Lanka, and then home again via Dubai and Shannon (pdf)."]}, {"article": "I gave up my job to go travelling for six months in south-east Asia.

Abdul Hakim Belhaj, the security commander in Tripoli, told the Guardian he was considering suing over the episode, which raises further damaging questions over Britain&apos;s knowledge of the rendition and ill-treatment of prisoners. One document found in a treasure trove of abandoned papers shows a senior MI6 officer boasting to the Libyans about how British intelligence led to Belhaj being captured on 6 March 2004. Then a leading dissident member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), Belhaj was seized in Bangkok and handed over to the CIA, who he alleges tortured him and injected him with truth serum before flying him back to Tripoli for interrogation. Documents show that five days before he was taken back to Tripoli, MI6 gave Libya Belhaj&apos;s French and Moroccan aliases, and told them he was in detention in Sepang, Malaysia. Belhaj told the Guardian that British spies were among the first to interrogate him after he was returned to Tripoli, and that he was very &quot;surprised that the British got involved in what was a very painful period in my life&quot;. &quot;I wasn&apos;t allowed a bath for three years and I didn&apos;t see the sun for one year,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;They hung me from the wall and kept me in an isolation cell. I was regularly tortured.&quot; Belhaj was released from the Libyan version of Abu Ghraib, Abu Selim prison, earlier this year after an amnesty announced by Gaddafi. He quickly took a lead role in the anti-government rebellion that ousted Gaddafi two weeks ago. &quot;This will not stop the new Libya having orderly relations with the United States and Britain,&quot; he said. &quot;But it did not need to happen.&quot; Scores of files, which were found abandoned at the British embassy and in the offices of senior members of the former regime, not only point to direct involvement of MI6 in this case, they also set out in sometimes excruciating detail how closely UK agencies were working with Libyan officials after Gaddafi came in from the diplomatic cold in 2004. The papers also show how MI5 appeared to seek a trade of information about Libyan dissidents in London for morsels of intelligence gleaned from Tripoli \u2013 despite Libya&apos;s reputation for torturing prisoners. Whitehall officials defended the links with Libya, saying the agencies were conducting themselves in line with &quot;ministerially authorised government policy&quot;. But the material in Tripoli casts remarkable light on the capricious nature of intelligence work and the grubby deals that are struck in the name of national security \u2013 as well as raising disturbing questions about the UK&apos;s complicity in and knowledge of torture. The Belhaj episode will be particularly discomforting for MI6, and may form part of a forthcoming inquiry chaired by Sir Peter Gibson, which is set to investigate the UK&apos;s role in rendition and the security services&apos; knowledge of the torture and mistreatment of terrorist suspects. The documents set out how MI6 believed it had played a crucial role in the capture of Belhaj seven years ago. On Sunday he told the Guardian how he was tortured in Bangkok by two CIA agents, before being returned to Libya, where he was tortured again. &quot;I was injected with something, hung from a wall by my arms and legs and put in a container surrounded by ice,&quot; he said. &quot;They did not let me sleep and there was noise all the time. And then they sent me to my enemy.&quot; Back in Libya, interrogators hung him from a wall every week and kept him in isolation for seven years. MI6 knew of his whereabouts because Belhaj was attempting to seek asylum in the UK \u2013 information that British officials appear to have used to get him arrested. The agency was interested in Belhaj because of his group&apos;s alleged links to al-Qaida \u2013 and the correspondence between the UK and Libya makes clear that MI6 wanted to ensure any information the Libyans gleaned from him went straight to Britain, and not through the Americans. Referring to Belhaj by his nom de guerre, the MI6 officer, Mark Allen, sent a note to Moussa Koussa, then Gaddafi&apos;s head of external security, saying: &quot;[His] information on the situation in this country is of urgent importance to us. &quot;Amusingly, we got a request from the Americans to channel requests for information from Abu Abd Allah through the Americans. I have no intention of doing any such thing. The intelligence about Abu Abd Allah was British.&quot; The papers indicate that, in all, eight prisoners were captured and put on CIA &quot;rendition&quot; flights back to Libya during this period. They also reveal how MI5 sent a delegation to Tripoli in 2005, seemingly to cement relations at a time when one of the service&apos;s main concerns was the potential threat posed to British security by other dissident members of LIFG living in the UK. One document, headed &quot;UK/Libya eyes only&quot;, shows the security service gave the Libyans the names, personal details and addresses of 50 LIFG members living in the UK. One chart recovered from the British embassy identifies 17 LIFG members in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Wales. The information was being provided for &quot;research and analysis purposes only&quot;. In return, an MI5 report requested co-operation from the Libyans &quot;to achieve our shared objectives&quot;. &quot;Such intelligence \u2013 particularly information relating to any financial transactions or to actual operational activity \u2013 is key to the security service working with the police to prosecute members of the group. The more timely information the better.&quot; MI5 said such intelligence could &quot;shed important new light on current LIFG activities in the UK&quot;. It would have been unthinkable for the UK to provide this kind of information to Libya in the 1980s \u2013 at the time, Gaddafi was running a covert assassination campaign to kill Libyan dissidents in Britain. Whitehall officials defended MI5 on Monday, insisting that the security service had legitimate reason to seek information on LIFG members, because it believed the group had links with Islamic extremists \u2013 ties that were not severed until 2009. They said there was a potential threat to national security, and that in such circumstances agencies could not always pick and choose who they dealt with. Nevertheless, it is quite possible that some of the dissidents reported on by MI5, like Belhaj, are now key members of the rebel forces that have toppled Gaddafi, and have been feted by the British government. The foreign secretary, William Hague, tried to sidestep the controversy surrounding the documents, saying that they &quot;relate to a period under the previous government, so I have no knowledge of those, of what was happening behind the scenes at that time&quot;. However, Whitehall officials seemed perplexed by Hague&apos;s remarks, saying the coalition government had the same problems as those faced by Labour \u2013 how to deal with countries where torture and abuse was common, but that might still provide valuable information for British counter-terrorism efforts. The Ministry of Defence was forced on the defensive too, after the papers showed that two of Gaddafi&apos;s sons were invited to visit the SAS headquarters in July 2006. Khamis and Saadi Gaddafi were to see demonstrations of the work of the SAS and the SBS, and were then to be given confidential briefings by, among others, the chief of the defence staff, General Sir Michael Jackson. UK defence companies were also to be introduced to the two brothers. Though the trip did not go ahead, the efforts that the MoD were prepared to go to \u2013 at the behest of the government \u2013 will embarrass military officials who are now involved in the hunt for Gaddafi and his relatives. By coincidence, the government&apos;s new anti-terrorist measures are to be debated in the Commons on Monday. &quot;When MPs vote in the Commons they should bear in mind we asked Libya for detainee briefs and the exchange of information on individuals,&quot; said Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil rights group Liberty. &quot;There is no way the Gibson process, effectively an internal Cabinet Office one, can be adequate to deal with the unfolding scandal of this magnitude.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-09-04T18:42:15Z", "tags": ["Libya", "MI6", "Rendition", "CIA", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa", "World news", "MI5", "UK news", "Foreign policy", "Defence policy", "Politics", "Abdel Hakim Belhaj"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/04/libyan-commander-demands-apology", "title": "Libyan commander demands apology over MI6 and CIA plot", "sentences": ["Then a leading dissident member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), Belhaj was seized in Bangkok and handed over to the CIA, who he alleges tortured him and injected him with truth serum before flying him back to Tripoli for interrogation.", "On Sunday he told the Guardian how he was tortured in Bangkok by two CIA agents, before being returned to Libya, where he was tortured again."]}, {"article": "David Cameron has asked the Gibson inquiry into alleged UK complicity in torture to be widened to examine the extent of intelligence-sharing by British secret services with the Libyan Gaddafi regime, including rendition and torture. He will set out details of how the Gibson inquiry will look into the allegations in a Commons statement updating MPs on the fall of the Gaddafi regime. Jack Straw, who was foreign secretary in the previous Labour government, said he welcomed the development but said he had never endorsed any secret programme of rendition or torture by the intelligence services. Straw said the inquiry could look into allegations that the security services may have been involved in operations without his knowledge or permission. The prime minister&apos;s spokesman responded to the uncovering of a tranche of documents in Tripoli showing the intimate links between British intelligence and Libya by saying the Gibson inquiry was well placed to look at the allegations. He said current British ministers have not seen the documents, and it was not entirely clear what they signified. He added the terms of reference of the Gibson inquiry would not need to be changed to include the new Libyan allegations. The Gibson inquiry has been stalled by the refusal of some lawyers to co-operate with it and by the need for some civil cases to be completed first. This opens the possibility that the Gibson inquiry will look into Libyan allegations first since they are not subject to UK civil court cases. The papers were found in the offices of Moussa Koussa, Libyan&apos;s head of intelligence services, who defected to Tunisia and then to Britain in late March. Downing Street said Moussa Koussa had not been given immunity from prosecution, but stressed he had been free to leave the UK. The documents show the UK provided intelligence to Libyan authorities in 2004 on Abdul Hakim Belhaj, who is now a commander with Libyan rebel forces. Britain was interested in gleaning intelligence on Belhaj because of his membership of the proscribed Islamist group the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, which had links with a-Qaida. He was delivered to the Libyan authorities by the US after being captured in Bangkok. He is now head of the military council in Tripoli, showing the extent of possible Islamist influence in the new regime, and the unpredictable nature of relations between the regime and the UK. Belhaj has claimed he was tortured by the CIA in Bangkok. Straw pointed out that the intelligence and security committee, a select committee set up by the prime minister to oversee the accountability of the security services, examined allegations of British complicity in torture in 2007, and found no evidence. Straw said he did not know if the new allegations were credible, but said &quot;these allegations must be examined in very great detail. It is very important that they should be These allegations are a very great source of concern to anyone, including myself. &quot;The position of successive British governments was very clear and that was they we were opposed to unlawful rendition and any use of torture. Not only did we not agree with it, nor were we complicit in it and we did not turn a blind eye to it,&quot; Straw added. He pointed out that the intelligence and security committee had itself pointed out that Straw had rejected some MI6 planned operations, showing the concern he had shown on the issue. &quot;I did not just tick submissions,&quot; he said. He added Britain&apos;s desire to weaken al-Qaida &quot;would never ever have justified our connivance or complicity in the use of torture, and it did not&quot;. Straw raised the possibility of senior intelligence figures keeping operations from him by saying &quot;no foreign secretary can know all the details of what its intelligence agencies are doing at any one time, and that is why it is important these allegations are examined by Sir Peter Gibson&apos;s inquiry&quot;. He defended the principle of the general co-operation between the British government and Libya on the basis that it led to Libya abandoning weapons of mass destruction voluntarily in 2003, describing this as &quot;a major step to a more peaceful Middle East&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2011-09-05T14:06:12Z", "tags": ["Libya", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa", "World news", "Torture", "Law", "Human rights", "Muammar Gaddafi", "Moussa Koussa", "David Cameron", "Politics", "UK news", "Rendition"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/05/torture-inquiry-investigate-uk-libya-rendition", "title": "Torture inquiry to investigate UK-Libya rendition claims", "sentences": ["He was delivered to the Libyan authorities by the US after being captured in Bangkok.", "Belhaj has claimed he was tortured by the CIA in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Pressure was mounting for tougher and more effective oversight of Britain&apos;s intelligence agencies as the disclosure of secret documents in Tripoli appeared to provoke panic and disarray across Whitehall. With confidential papers from Libya raising important questions about the conduct of MI5 and MI6, particularly regarding the rendition of prisoners to countries where they faced torture, MPs said the system of scrutiny had to be changed. A forthcoming inquiry into the UK&apos;s involvement in the torture and abuse of detainees, chaired by the retired judge Sir Peter Gibson, said it would investigate the latest allegations, which involve the capture and transfer to Tripoli in 2004 of two Libyan dissidents opposed to the Gaddafi regime. In a Commons statement on Monday, David Cameron welcomed the move to investigate the new &quot;accusations of malpractice&quot; and said ministers from the last government would have to answer for what happened. Ed Miliband also urged the Gibson inquiry, which has been heavily criticised for lacking teeth, to &quot;get to the bottom of the allegations... no part of the British state may ever be complicit in torture&quot;. The unease in Whitehall over the revelations from Tripoli has been compounded by confusion over whether MI5 and MI6 had provided full disclosures about the operations to MPs, or to Gibson, who has spent a year gathering information from the agencies in preparation for his hearings. Two principal allegations emerged from confidential papers left abandoned in the offices of former members of the Gaddafi regime. One involves a senior commander of the Libyan rebels, Abdul Hakim Belhaj, who has demanded an apology from the British and American governments for the way he was treated in 2004. Then a dissident living in Malaysia, he was flown back to Tripoli by the CIA, where he says he was subjected to torture over seven years. In one document, a senior MI6 official, Sir Mark Allen, boasts of the role Britain played in the operation to have him taken to Libya. He also makes it clear the agency wanted information gleaned from him during questioning, almost certainly because of fears in British counter-terrorism circles that some dissident members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group had links to al-Qaida. Other documents suggest that the UK worked with the Libyans to mount their own &quot;rendition&apos;&apos; operation to remove from Hong Kong a man called Abu Munthir, despite the risk that he might be tortured when he returned. Munthir, who was also a senior figure in the LIFG, is thought to be in Tunisia. Neither case has been made public before, but details should have been given to MPs on the parliamentary intelligence and security committee, which published a report on rendition in 2007 as part of its official oversight of the security agencies. In this report, and numerous others, the ISC has insisted it found no evidence of illegal activity by them. However, the Guardian has been told that the ISC did not know about either of the new cases at the time it wrote the 2007 report, and no evidence has been provided since then. MPs on the committee say they have been told they cannot speak about this. Richard Ottoway, one of the nine members of the ISC at the time, told the Guardian he had been &quot;advised it would be a criminal offence&quot; if he discussed the matter. Asked whether he feared the committee had been misled, he said: &quot;Every member of the committee signed up to the Official Secrets Act, so I can&apos;t answer that.&quot; The Gibson inquiry, set up last July, should also have been given details of the cases. Early on Monday, his staff indicated that they had not been informed about them. Two hours later they backtracked. A statement said: &quot;As part of its preparation work the inquiry has already been made aware of and has received material relating to these issues and they will be considered by the inquiry.&quot; Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on extraordinary rendition, said that he was losing confidence in the ability of Gibson to get to the truth about such operations, echoing the concerns of human rights organisations who say they will boycott the hearings. &quot;Sir Peter Gibson&apos;s early decisions \u2013 not to appoint an investigator, not to look at detainee transfer in theatre, not to sufficiently engage with the victims \u2013 do not inspire public confidence,&quot; Tyrie said. He added that the new documents &quot;highlight once again the shortcomings&quot; of parliamentary scrutiny of the intelligence services, and that the ISC&apos;s powers needed to be strengthened following its &quot;damaging&quot; failure to establish the facts about rendition. Ottoway also conceded that it was high time the ISC was given greater powers to oversee the work of the intelligence agencies. MPs have no way of knowing whether the agencies are giving them all the material they have. &quot;The committee only has the power to request information. At the moment, the heads of the agencies can decide whether to provide it. In future, decisions like that should be made by the secretary of state, not by the agencies themselves.&quot; Sir Malcolm Rifkind, current chairman of the ISC, said: &quot;The committee needs to be fully informed about the views of the security services on these very serious allegations. I expect to hear from them in the near future.&quot; He wanted &quot;clarification&quot; about &quot;the nature and extent of intelligence-sharing with the Libyan security services and the rendition of Libyan nationals&quot;. Whitehall officials defended the actions of the agencies, saying they had acted within the law and in accordance with government policy as laid down by ministers. They defended the policy of co-operating with Gaddafi&apos;s security apparatus, saying Britain had not been involved in an illegal rendition operation and had sought assurances from Libya that individuals sent to Tripoli would not be badly treated. Referring to the two cases identified in documents found in the Libyan capital, they said that individuals had been &quot;deported&quot; and sent to Libya by two sovereign governments. UK security sources argue that Belhaj and Munthir were sent to Libya legally and that assurances were sought about their treatment. &quot;We needed to be convinced&quot;, the source added, saying Britain otherwise could have been acting unlawfully. Belhaj has described being tortured by CIA officers who interrogated him in Bangkok before he was flown back to Libya. He has also described being tortured repeatedly after he returned to Tripoli. Sir Mark Allen declined to comment.", "publicationDate": "2011-09-05T19:53:55Z", "tags": ["MI5", "MI6", "Libya", "Muammar Gaddafi", "Human rights", "Politics", "Rendition"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/sep/05/whitehall-papers-libya-spy-agencies-torture", "title": "Whitehall alarm as secret papers from Libya link UK spy agencies to torture", "sentences": ["Belhaj has described being tortured by CIA officers who interrogated him in Bangkok before he was flown back to Libya."]}, {"article": "A Libyan rebel leader who was rendered to Tripoli with the assistance of MI6 said on Monday that he had told British intelligence officers he was being tortured but they did nothing to help him. In a claim that will increase the pressure for further disclosure about the UK&apos;s role in torture and rendition since 9/11, Abdul Hakim Belhaj said a team of British interrogators used hand signals to indicate they understood what he was telling them. &quot;I couldn&apos;t believe they could let this go on,&quot; he said. &quot;What has happened deserves a full inquiry.&quot; Belhaj was detained by the CIA in Thailand in 2004 following an MI6 tipoff, allegedly tortured, then flown to Tripoli, where he says he suffered years of abuse in one of Muammar Gaddafi&apos;s prisons. It emerged on Monday that MI6 had been able to tell the CIA of his whereabouts after his associates informed British diplomats in Malaysia that he wished to claim asylum in the UK. Belhaj was then allowed to board a flight for London and abducted when the plane called at Bangkok. There were signs that the discovery of a cache of secret MI6 and CIA documents at an abandoned government office building in Tripoli was triggering panic in some parts of Whitehall. The papers detail the UK&apos;s role not only in the rendition of Belhaj, but in that of a second man, known as Abu Munthir. This operation appears to have been planned by British and Libyan intelligence officers without any CIA involvement. David Cameron said the disclosures would be investigated by the Gibson inquiry, set up last year to examine the UK&apos;s role in torture and rendition. It was unclear whether MI6 or MI5 had disclosed anything to the inquiry before the documents came to light. Inquiry staff first indicated they knew nothing about the Libyan operations, and were seeking information from the government &quot;as soon as possible&quot;. Later they said they had &quot;received material relating to these issues&quot;, but declined to be more specific. Similarly, the Conservative MP Richard Ottaway, a former member of the intelligence and security committee, a Westminster body supposed to provide oversight of MI5 and MI6, indicated the committee knew nothing about the UK-Libya operations before giving the agencies a clean bill of health in a 2007 report on rendition; he then said he could say nothing about the matter [see footnote]. The BBC last night reported that Abdelati Obeidi, a former Libyan foreign minister under Muammar Gaddafi, as saying that MI6 had been operating in Tripoli until the start of the revolution in February. He added that relations between Libyan and British intelligence services were not as close as when his predecessor Moussa Koussa was in charge. Belhaj on Monday revealed more details of the lead-up to his rendition on 6 March 2004, which he says came amid his attempts to reach the UK, of which the government had become aware. He said he had first tried to travel to London from Kuala Lumpur via Beijing in late February that year. However, he was refused permission to board in Beijing, despite carrying a French passport, which does not require a pre-issued UK visa. He was returned to Kuala Lumpur where he was detained by Malaysian immigration officials. It is understood that an associate of Belhaj then visited the British embassy in Kuala Lumpur advising officials there of his intention to seek political asylum in the UK. Shortly afterwards he was freed from the detention centre and allowed to buy a ticket to London via Bangkok. By then he had disposed of his French passport, issued to a Jamal Kaderi, and was travelling on a Moroccan passport, issued in the name of Abdul al-Nabi. Holders of Moroccan passports require a pre-issued visa to enter the UK, but Belhaj said he did not apply for a visa and was allowed to board without one \u2013 a highly unusual practice. The revelation raises fresh questions about the extent of the government&apos;s role in Belhaj&apos;s rendition. Documents discovered last Friday reveal that a senior MI6 officer, Mark Allen, had written to Koussa, who was then the Libyan spy chief, congratulating him on receiving Belhaj and acknowledging that &quot;the intelligence was British&quot;. &quot;I would not board until they assured me that I could travel to the UK,&quot; Belhaj said. &quot;They did that and I got on the plane.&quot; Belhaj was captured by CIA officers, in co-operation with Thai authorities, inside Bangkok airport. He says he was tortured at a site in the airport grounds and then sent to Libya, where Gaddafi had long seen him as one of the biggest threats to his tyrannical four-decade rule. &quot;The British were the second team to visit me,&quot; he said. &quot;They came about a month after I was returned to Libya and they were very well briefed about LIFG [Libyan Islamic Fighting Group] members in the UK. They knew everything, even their code names. They wanted to know more details about the LIFG and also about the general environment elsewhere, al-Qaida, that sort of thing. There was a woman who was leading the team, a big man and a third person who was translating. They only came one time.&quot; Belhaj said intelligence officers from other European countries, including France, Germany and Italy, also travelled to Tripoli to speak to him inside the infamous Abu Selim prison in south Tripoli. Before each visit he was told by Libyan officers \u2013 and sometimes by Koussa \u2013 to &quot;tell the British and others that the people they are asking about are al-Qaida&quot;. &quot;The Libyans told me that if I told them that I would be treated better.&quot; He said Koussa, who fled the Gaddafi regime in March with MI6 help, would often taunt him in prison, with threats that he would die there. On one occasion Koussa ordered guards to put a shade over half of Belhaj&apos;s cell window, to reduce what little sunlight he was getting. Files seen by the Guardian on Sunday inside the now ransacked offices of the external security service reveal that Libyan spies remained in close co-operation with the CIA and MI6 as late as last November. The files reveal the Americans, in particular, were regularly requesting information about the identities of Libyan mobile phone users. One document showed that the CIA had responded to a Libyan request about the user of a satellite phone by giving GPS references for every call made. Key questions Who authorised the UK-Libya rendition operations? Government ministers gave the go-ahead for MI6 to mount the operations, but the Foreign Office, the Cabinet Office and Downing Street are all declining to say which department&apos;s ministers were responsible. Were there any other rendition operations involving the UK ? It seems unlikely that there were only two operations, given how extraordinarily close MI6 and Gaddafi&apos;s intelligence services appear to have become, but no further details have yet emerged. Were the British involved in renditions involving other countries? Papers disclosed in UK courts show that the British government decided to allow its nationals to be &quot;rendered&quot; from Afghanistan to Guant\u00e1namo Bay by the US after 9/11, and were involved in the interrogation of prisoners held by agencies known to use torture in Pakistan, Bangladesh and elsewhere. But details of the UK-Libya rendition operation would not have emerged had the Gaddafi regime not collapsed in such a disorderly way, raising concerns the UK government may have been involved in many more operations that remain hidden. What happened to &quot;Abu Munthir&quot;, whose rendition from Hong Kong to Tripoli was planned by the British and the Libyans, according to a secret CIA document discovered at the weekend? He is now thought not to be the man by that name who was involved in a UK bomb plot in the UK, but another man, Sami Saadi, who was freed from jail in Tripoli last year. There are unconfirmed reports that he is in Tunisia, receiving hospital treatment. But the whereabouts of his family remain unclear. Will the Gibson Inquiryget to the truth about the UK&apos;s role in torture and rendition? Human rights groups and lawyers representing rendition and torture victims are boycotting the inquiry, which they have condemned as a sham, and now backbench Tory MPs are also saying they are losing faith. Even if Gibson does uncover new information, it&apos;s unclear that this will ever be shared with the public \u2013 the cabinet secretary, Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell has the final say on what is published and what is kept secret. \u2022 This article was footnoted on 2 November 2011.

In a speech to the 16-nation Pacific Islands Forum this week, President Anote Tong said radical action may be needed and that he had been looking at a $2bn plan that involved &quot;structures resembling oil rigs&quot;:  &quot;The last time I saw the models, I was like &apos;wow it&apos;s like science fiction, almost like something in space. So modern, I don&apos;t know if our people could live on it. But what would you do for your grandchildren? If you&apos;re faced with the option of being submerged, with your family, would you jump on an oil rig like that? And [I] think the answer is &apos;yes&apos;. We are running out of options, so we are considering all of them.&quot;  Kiribati is not alone. Tuvalu, Tonga, the Maldives, the Cook and the Solomon Islands are all losing the battle against the rising seas and are finding it tough to pay for sea defences. Kiribati faces an immediate bill of over $900m just to protect its infrastructure. But history shows there is no technological reason why the nation could not stay in the middle of the Pacific even if sea levels rose several feet. The Uros people of Peru live on around 40 floating villages made of grasses in the middle of Lake Titicaca. Equally, the city of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec predecessor of Mexico City that was home to 250,000 people when the Spaniards arrived, stood on a small natural island in Lake Texcoco that was surrounded by hundreds of artificial islands. More recently, Holland, Japan, Dubai, and Hong Kong have all built artificial islands for airports, or new housing. The mayor of London Boris Johnson has a vision of a giant international airport in the middle of the Thames estuary with five runways to replace Heathrow. Kiribati could also take a lesson from the Maldives, where the rubbish of the capital city Male and the hundreds of tourist islands, is sent to the artificial island of Thilafushi. It&apos;s growing about one square metre per day. Neft Daslari, Stalin&apos;s city in the middle of the Caspian sea, is still operational after more than 60 years. At its peak it housed over 5,000 oil workers 34 miles off the Azerbaijan coastline. It began with a single path out over the water and grew to have over 300km of streets, mainly built on the back of sunken ships. Kiribati could emulate Spiral Island in Mexico. This was constructed by British artist Richard &quot;Rishi&quot; Sowa on a base of 250,000 plastic bottles. The island was destroyed by Hurricane Emily in 2005 but is being rebuilt. With millions of tonnes of rubbish already floating in the Pacific, and plans to collect it, Kiribati could solve two problems in one go. But Tong&apos;s imagination has been stirred by a more futuristic vision. It&apos;s possible he&apos;s seen the &quot;Lilypad&quot; floating city concept by the Belgian architect Vincent Callebaut. This &quot;ecopolis&quot; would not only be able to produce its own energy through solar, wind, tidal and biomass but would also process CO2 in the atmosphere and absorb it into its titanium dioxide skin. Bangkok architects S+PBA have come up with the idea of a floating &quot;wetropolis&quot; to replace eventually the metropolis of Bangkok. They say that Bangkok is founded on marshes and with sea levels rising several centimetres a year and the population growing fast, it&apos;s cheaper and more ecologically sound to embrace the rising seas than fight them. Stranger still could be the German architect Wolf Hilbertz&apos;s idea for a self-assembling sea city called Autopia Ampere. Hilbertz plans to use the process of electrodeposition to create an island that would build itself in the water. It would begin as a series of wire mesh armatures connected to a supply of low-voltage direct current produced by solar panels. The electrochemical reactions would draw up sea minerals over time, creating walls of calcium carbonate on the armatures. Islands have always fascinated political utopians, and now the billionaire hedge-fund manager and technology utopian Peter Thiel, has linked with Patri Friedman, a former Google engineer and grandson of Nobel prize-winning free market economist Milton Friedman to envisage a libertarian floating country. Their idea is to build a series of physically linked oil-rig-type platforms anchored in international waters. The new state would be built by entrepreneurs and have no regulation, laws, no welfare, restrictions on weapons or moral code of ethics. Eventually, millions of &quot;seasteading&quot; people would live there. Plans for a prototype are said to have been drawn up for the first diesel-powered, 12,000-tonne structure with room for 270 residents. Eventually, dozens \u2013 perhaps even hundreds \u2013 of these could be linked together, says Friedman who hopes to launch a flotilla of floating offices off the San Francisco coast next year. In the end, it depends on money, which is in short supply for poor countries. If the world puts up several billion dollars \u2013 as Tong and his people would probably prefer \u2013 it would be technically possible for Kiribati to stay where it is. Realistically, though, Australia, New Zealand and larger Pacific states are likely to be leaned on heavily to provide land for the Kiribatians and the world can expect a series of evacuations over the next 30 years.", "publicationDate": "2011-09-08T15:47:31Z", "tags": ["Environment", "Sea level", "Oceans", "Climate change"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/sep/08/artificial-island-pacific-sea-levels", "title": "Artificial island could be solution for rising Pacific sea levels | John Vidal", "sentences": ["Bangkok architects S+PBA have come up with the idea of a floating &quot;wetropolis&quot; to replace eventually the metropolis of Bangkok.", "They say that Bangkok is founded on marshes and with sea levels rising several centimetres a year and the population growing fast, it&apos;s cheaper and more ecologically sound to embrace the rising seas than fight them."]}, {"article": "     Libya&apos;s interim prime minister arrived in Tripoli on Thursday for his first public appearance in the capital since Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown more than two weeks ago, to face criticism that the country is experiencing a power vacuum.

We need to find the right people.&quot; Jibril admitted that the NTC had got off to a slow start. &quot;I agree there hasn&apos;t been a good contact and connection because of what&apos;s going on in the liberation of Libya,&quot; he said. &quot;We promise after next week we hope to start a national dialogue through the territories of Libya.&quot; But he also rounded on critics for being impatient and playing politics. &quot;There has been an intense campaign against individuals in the NTC. Libyans must answer why this is happening.&quot; He noted that the liberation battle was not yet over, with regime forces still holding out in a handful of towns and Gaddafi himself still at large. &quot;Some of our colleagues have forgotten this. Some felt the old regime has collapsed completely and all of Libya is liberated. Some have made attempts to start the political games before reaching a common consensus on the rules.&quot; Jibril said: &quot;I call on all Libyans, especially the youths, to see this is a stage where we have to unify and be together and have national honour, not to attack each other because the battle is not yet finished. Once the battle is over and the constitution is finished and there is an interim government, the political games can start.&quot; Jibril said he hoped the entire NTC would complete its move from Benghazi to Tripoli by the end of next week. He repeated his pledge not to seek office and refused to comment on whether he knew Gaddafi&apos;s whereabouts. Earlier, about 200 delegates from across the country \u2013 a third of them women \u2013 attended the February 17 Coalition meeting at a conference centre next to Tripoli&apos;s Rixos hotel. The dissenters pointed to cracks in a rebel movement that has been striking in its unity around a common flag and the common goal of toppling Gaddafi. Abdulrazag Elaraoi, an NTC member from Tripoli, said: &quot;Now comes the real test. Leaders need to lead. If they are not there when the crisis is breaking, they cannot deal with it wirelessly. People want a change. Can Mahmoud Jibril do it? People have to decide.&quot; Abdul Rahman Sweehly, a representative from Misrata, said: &quot;This is a warning shot to Mr Jibril and Mr [Mustafa Abdul] Jalil [NTC chairman]. They are deliberately delaying the formation of a transitional government with excuses and excuses. We have to be steadfast in protecting our revolution and stopping people trying to hijack it or turn it around.&quot; Concerns were raised that too many officials from the old order were still wielding influence. Sweehly said: &quot;Look at America or Britain. When a new government comes in, people depart and others take over. Why shouldn&apos;t we do the same? For example, when Barack Obama replaced George Bush, there were 4,000 vacant positions.&quot; Another speaker from Misrata called for &quot;a new Libya with new faces, not old ones&quot;. He went on: &quot;We shouldn&apos;t forgive hands stained with blood or people who stole money from Libya.&quot; He insisted: &quot;We are prepared for another revolution if we have to.&quot; A member of the Tripoli brigade also said: &quot;In the absence of security, the revolution can be hijacked. We go to a meeting and they say, &apos;We&apos;re going to do, we&apos;re going to do, we&apos;re going to do.&apos; The next day, nothing happens.&quot; A speaker from Benghazi expressed frustration at how the justice ministry and others had not yet been formed. &quot;There are still no courts.&quot; The killing of rebel commander General Abdel Fattah Younes in July raised the spectre of divisions in the anti-Gaddafi movement. Libya&apos;s new leaders face a daunting task of establishing security, restoring public services and balancing regional and tribal interests in an inclusive government. A timetable, lasting about 20 months, for the drafting of a constitution and holding of elections should start once the NTC declares Libya&apos;s &quot;liberation&quot;. Also in Tripoli on Thursday, the capital&apos;s military commander, Abdul Hakim Belhaj, demanded an apology from a senior British official for the first time since learning that MI6 had allegedly played a role in his rendition to Libya seven years ago. Belhaj, whom the CIA sent to the Gaddafi regime seven years ago after seizing him at Bangkok airport, met Britain&apos;s special representative in Libya, Dominic Asquith. Belhaj&apos;s spokesman described the meeting as &quot;civilised&quot;, but said Asquith had declined to apologise, citing the Gibson inquiry which is investigating the MI6 claims. The allegations emerged from an archive of correspondence between Libyan spies and MI6 found in a ransacked spy headquarters in Tripoli. A diplomatic source in Tripoli said: &quot;The special representative said that we take these claims very seriously and explained that last year the PM set up the Gibson inquiry to examine whether the security services were involved in the improper treatment of detainees overseas, including rendition. Overnight, Gaddafi resurfaced on the airwaves to berate his enemies as &quot;rats&quot; and &quot;stray dogs&quot; and insist he was still in Libya to fight on. In what Syrian broadcaster Arrai said was a telephone call from Libya early on Thursday, the 69-year-old Gaddafi rallied supporters and said surrender was out of the question. &quot;Our resolute Libyan people, the Libyan land is your own,&quot; Gaddafi said. &quot;Those who try to take it from you now, they are intruders, they are mercenaries, they are stray dogs. They are trying to seize our ancestral land from you but this is impossible. &quot;We will not leave our ancestral land. The youths are now ready to escalate the resistance against the rats in Tripoli and to finish off the mercenaries.&quot; A Libyan military convoy that entered neighbouring Niger across the desert this week has stirred speculation that he might be about to flee. But, in remarks which clearly indicated he was speaking after those reports were published, Gaddafi said: &quot;This is not the first time that convoys drive in and out of Niger.&quot; Meanwhile, rebel fighters tightened a siege on the town of Bani Walid, where two of Gaddafi&apos;s sons may be sheltering. Gaddafi loyalists in the town launched rockets during exchanges of fire.", "publicationDate": "2011-09-08T19:30:30Z", "tags": ["Libya", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa", "World news", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Muammar Gaddafi", "Mahmoud Jibril"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/08/libya-mahmoud-jibril-growing-unrest", "title": "Libya's new PM Mahmoud Jibril faces growing unrest", "sentences": ["Belhaj, whom the CIA sent to the Gaddafi regime seven years ago after seizing him at Bangkok airport, met Britain&apos;s special representative in Libya, Dominic Asquith."]}, {"article": "There are three remarkable things about Marple: Nemesis, a 2008 ITV outing for Agatha Christie&apos;s elderly detective. For a start, it&apos;s the only time she&apos;s handed a mission, rather than just stumbling across a body and spontaneously sleuthing. It took more liberties with the original novel than usual \u2013 plots were dropped, motives skewed, two characters conflated to make\u00a0a serial-killing lesbian nun. And, finally, it was directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, then best known for the Pusher trilogy: a\u00a0Danish gangster saga, all grimy machismo and intestines down the sink. &quot;I was broke as hell,&quot; he explains, chewing popcorn in a back room at the O2 centre in London. &quot;I&apos;d gone bankrupt\u00a0and owed my bank \u00a31m. I paid that back by making the Pusher sequels but I myself had no money. And I was really tired of Denmark. I needed a break.&quot; In fact, Refn directed two Marples; the other he says he forgets the title of. Anyway, he requested his name be removed from the credits; there are dark mutters about post-production discussions with &quot;people I maybe didn&apos;t respect. But I loved Geraldine McEwan. We became very close. I wish she were younger; she&apos;s a fucking powerhouse.&quot; It was, he says, a hack job, but look back at Nemesis today and it&apos;s clearly Refn&apos;s work. There&apos;s the primal violence, the big acoustics, the screen soaked in his signature blanket of red. And, oddly enough, it&apos;s Marple that somehow provides a truer link\u00a0to his new film, Drive, than the\u00a0rest of his back catalogue (the\u00a0Pusher films, Fear X, Bleeder, mad Norse bloodbath Valhalla Rising, splashy jailbird biopic Bronson). Both\u00a0Marple and Drive are unashamedly accessible \u2013 the latter, with its pink neon titles and hooky soundtrack, has been described by its star, Ryan Gosling, as a\u00a0John Hughes movie with head-smashing. Both films feature an apparently immortal protagonist with impeccable motives whose aim is the protection of others \u2013 a superhero, of sorts. And both are simple stories of good and evil. The difference is that Drive is a stunning leap forward for Refn, and an inspired winner of the best director award at Cannes this year. Gosling plays a taciturn stunt driver who moonlights behind the wheel of\u00a0getaway cars after hours. It&apos;s a quiet life\u00a0of cruising\u00a0and eluding that skids off the tracks when he meets young mother Carey Mulligan and later her ex-con husband. In James Sallis&apos;s original novella, there&apos;s a backstory. The movie strips that out and places faith in the lean, mean, purring fundamentals. Refn makes a case for Drive as an almost childish fable \u2013 albeit one in which someone gets a fork in the face (and not by accident). &quot;I read Grimm fairytales to my daughter a few years ago, and the idea with Drive was similar. You have the driver who&apos;s like a knight, the innocent maiden, the evil king [Albert Brooks&apos;s nefarious kingpin] and the dragon [Ron Perlman&apos;s roaring mobster]. They&apos;re all archetypes. It takes place in a city of millions but you never really see anyone. That isolates them, makes it very specific.&quot; It&apos;s highly developed, all this, more than\u00a0one might pick up from a single viewing. At one point Gosling takes Mulligan and her son to a canal: a\u00a0pastoral idyll in the middle of Los Angeles. The keynote tune pumps out over the top, a trippy synth number about proving yourself &quot;a real human being, and a real hero&quot;. It&apos;s back in\u00a0refrain at the climax, when Gosling&apos;s character graduates to real hero status, a body double no more. &quot;He&apos;s the man we\u00a0all aspire to be,&quot; Refn says. &quot;But he wasn&apos;t\u00a0meant to live in the real world. He&apos;s too noble, too innocent.&quot; Indeed, for such a sensual film, Drive is striking for\u00a0the chasteness of its central affair \u2013 Refn even snipped out a kiss early on for fear it would &quot;ruin the poetry&quot;. &quot;In the old days knights would put a sword between themselves and a woman. And in Los Angeles, a man like this exists.&quot; To some extent, the more significant love story is that between its director and\u00a0its star. Gosling, on board first, was eager to court Refn, but their initial dinner was awkward. &quot;Like a blind date gone wrong,&quot; Refn says. &quot;Then Ryan drove me home,&quot; (Refn doesn&apos;t have a licence, having failed his test eight times), &quot;and this song, Can&apos;t Fight This Feeling by REO Speedwagon, came on the radio and I started singing along and\u00a0all that isolation and loneliness was overcome. We understood each other. The film is that scene, really.&quot; His eyes glisten at the memory. The pair plan to explore this &quot;telekinetic&quot; connection on two further projects, one of which, Only God Forgives, starts shooting in a fortnight in Bangkok. Such enthusiasm \u2013 they wooed the crowds at Cannes by smooching metrosexually on the red carpet \u2013 is a product of his style as a director: Marple aside, it&apos;s full-throttle or nothing. There&apos;s no way Refn couldn&apos;t have fallen for his leading man. He&apos;s a self-confessed fanboy, who allies himself with the crowds in the O2 attending Big Screen, the UK&apos;s inaugural crack at aping Comic-Con. &quot;These are my people,&quot; he tells me as Darth Vader and some goblins stumble past. At first, it&apos;s hard to swallow \u2013 he&apos;s a drawling transatlantic sophisticate whose dad is Lars von Trier&apos;s long-time editor and whose cardie looks like it cost a bomb. But he&apos;s an obsessive, certainly. &quot;I&apos;m not the greatest film-maker in the world by any means,&quot; he says, &quot;but I am the best film-maker to make this kind of film. I have to make it into a fetish.&quot; For Drive that meant decamping to LA with his wife and their two young daughters, where they lived and edited the film in a house along with Mulligan and screenwriter Hossein Amini. &quot;Ryan would come by all the time. It was very collaborative. All we needed was a lot of cocaine and it would have been like 1973.&quot; Gosling has recalled Refn wandering round the set, listening to his iPod, tears streaming down his face. When he and Mulligan were rehearsing a scene, the director would just hug them until he felt they were ready. &quot;I&apos;d tell them: &apos;Go with God, go with God.&apos;&quot; Meaning what? He shrugs and smiles. &quot;Believe in me.&quot; Yikes. But then Refn would be the first to admit that his strain of obsessive enthusiasm can spill into vainglory. In his youth he was known in Denmark as &quot;l&apos;Enfant Sauvage&quot; \u2013 he was, in his own words, &quot;arrogant, self-absorbed, degrading, a megalomaniac&quot;. His sticky relationship with his homeland&apos;s cinema industry seems to stem from his decision to turn down a place at the National Film School when he was offered cash to fund Pusher. &quot;But, fuck! Give me a break! I had a movie to make. I&apos;m a New Yorker by heart. I believe in doing.&quot; It didn&apos;t pay off at first. The film failed to pick up screenings at even small film festivals, until a London distributor took a punt on it, &quot;and my life changed radically&quot;. In fact, the UK has served Refn well (he&apos;s reciprocally enthusiastic about us) \u2013 after that bankruptcy wobble and the Marple experience, his next two films were shot on these shores (Bronson in Nottingham, Valhalla in Glasgow). But his key professional moment he pinpoints as a personal one: the birth of his first daughter. &quot;Having a child made me a much better director. Everything in my life changed. I understood that what I was making was not about me, it was about the process of creating. You have to cut the tie to your own ego.&quot; He warms to his theme. &quot;Film-making is the only thing a man can do that could possibly be similar to a woman giving birth. It&apos;s such an emotionally complex experience, we men could never understand what a woman goes through, which is why women are so much more sophisticated and interesting, and in my opinion should rule the world.&quot; Refn is eager to tout his feminine credentials: he likes pink, and playing with dolls, but he can&apos;t stand sports. Word is he&apos;ll be top of the pile to direct the Wonder\u00a0Woman\u00a0movie, on the proviso that his first bonafide blockbuster \u2013 a\u00a0Logan&apos;s Run\u00a0remake, also with Gosling \u2013 passes muster. Might he have liked to be\u00a0born a woman? He hums. &quot;I guess my ideal world would be one of only women.&quot; But wouldn&apos;t he be dead? &quot;No, I&apos;d be the\u00a0only guy.&quot; So he&apos;d have fun. &quot;Hell, yeah!&quot; He grins broadly and cracks on with\u00a0his popcorn, a fanboy at heart after all, perhaps. Drive is released on 23 September.

In the wake of the September 11 attack and the invasion of Iraq, western intelligence agencies were desperate for information about extremists, and hoped that Libya could fill in some of the gaps. The papers, assuming they are genuine, do not offer a complete picture, or even a partial one. Instead, they offer glimpses into the world of 21st-century espionage, and into the techniques and mechanics of a profession that necessarily conducts itself in the diplomatic shadows. They also show that intelligence gathering and sharing is a business conducted on an industrial scale. Threat to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi There were numerous exchanges between the US, the UK and Libya over potential terrorist threats, but only one named an individual as a potential assassination target \u2013 Muammar Gaddafi&apos;s son, who is now wanted by the international criminal court for crimes against humanity. At that time he was living in London as a student at the London School of Economics. The threat was obviously vague, but deemed serious enough to raise with the Libyans, and to involve MI5 and Scotland Yard. On 6 January 2004, the CIA sent a letter to Sadeq Krima, head of Libyan international relations, titled &quot;Threat to Saif al-Islam Gaddafi&quot;.  We are in the process of tracing the names in the report passed to us regarding the threat \u2026 and will respond when our traces are complete. In the process of tracing the names in the report \u2026 we note that the attempt may take place in either the UK or France.  Two weeks later, on 20 January, there is a follow up report from the same CIA officer.  Neither we nor the British security service have any traces on the individuals named. The report has been passed to the Metropolitan police special branch and Saif al-Islam has been placed on their &quot;at-risk&quot; register. The police have visited him to discuss the threat, and he appears content with the measures being taken.  Asked about the threat to Gaddafi, Scotland Yard refused to comment. Abu Munthir and his rendition to Tripoli There are numerous documents about the transfer of Abu Munthir \u2013 from the mundane details of how and when he could be transported, to the allegations about his role in international terrorism. At first, the Hong Kong authorities were not keen to let him go, initially because they didn&apos;t want a Libyan plane landing at the airport, but also because the Libyans had not given them the assurances they wanted about his safety. The CIA sent urgent memos to Libya telling Tripoli what to do, including the telephone numbers for Stanley Wing, Hong Kong&apos;s principal secretary for security.  Our service has become aware that last weekend LIFG [Libyan Islamic Fighting Group] deputy Emir Abu Munthir and his spouse and children were being held in Hong Kong detention for immigration/passport violations. We are also aware that your service had been co-operating with the British to effect Abu Munthir&apos;s removal to Tripoli. Our understanding is that the Hong Kong special wing originally denied permission to your aircraft to land. If payment of a charter aircraft is an issue our service would be willing to assist financially \u2026It is also our understanding that Hong Kong officials have insisted that prior to turning Abu Munthir over to your custody they must receive clear assurances from your government that Abu Munthir and his family will be treated humanely.  The Libyans also set out the allegations made against Munthir, sending an information card, from Dr A Karkoub, a security chief in Tripoli, which were said to contain &quot;the crimes and terrorist activities that he committed \u2026 &quot; On separate documents, which may have been part of Karkoub&apos;s bundle, there is a peculiar CV for Munthir, who is also known as Sami Mostafa Assaadi. The document is written in English, but the language is very poor. It claims that Munthir was an &quot;intimate&quot; of Osama bin Laden, training with him in Afghanistan and moving with him to Sudan. There is no way of verifying any of these claims. The documents relating to Munthir also include a request to the Italians from the Libyans in 1997 for his arrest. It includes some of the language in the earlier document, but has some extra details \u2013 such as a claim that Munthir came to the UK in 1996.  The Great Socialist People&apos;s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to the embassy of the republic of ItalyJune 6 1997Son of Khadija Banouns, his normal residence is in Tripoli, Ben Ashur Street. He was a student at the faculty of engineering.Having joined the extremist faction he moved among UK, Sudan, Pakistan and Afghanistan. He received his training on terrorist operations and forgery in Peshawar, Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Sudan.Currently he is considered leader of what so-called &quot;Al-Jihad&quot; and affiliated to so called the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. He is considered the legislative mufti of the organisation.He entered the Sudan in the name of Said Mostafa Assaadi. He left Khartoum on his way to UK on 17 March, 1996.Under the title Broad Lines in LIFG&apos;s programme \u2026 he wrote numerous editions of Dawn Bulletin \u2026 in the latest edition published in volume 22 \u2026 enclosed by three pages obliging to assassinate rulers. He ordered his followers in Libya to be armed and helped by God to fight God&apos;s foes.  The Manchester agent The papers shed some light on the way MI6 handles agents in the UK, and there is some detail about one individual \u2013 a Libyan in Manchester. The man is given a name in the documents, but for his own safety, the Guardian will call him Alan. The correspondence between MI6 and Tripoli in late 2003 shows he was an agent for another European intelligence agency, but that MI6 wanted him too. Alan is obviously anxious about the situation, as the letters make clear. The correspondence gives just a glimpse of the gauntlet run by informers \u2013 the risks they take and the dangers they face. The memos are addressed to Sadeq Krema, the head of Libyan international relations.  Greetings from MI6 in London.We phoned Alan and arranged a meeting the following day in Manchester at 4.30pm \u2026 gave him directions to Malmaison hotel where we had booked a room.Alan arrived on his own and we greeted each other in the foyer. He was nervous. He had had a paranoid walk to the hotel across Manchester with too much eye contact from passers-by that had unduly [un]nerved him. We reassured him by going over the cover story we had discussed when we met in Tripoli. We would not be seen in public but in the unlikely event that anyone saw us in the hotel I would simply be his business contact. Furthermore there no links between the hotel booking and MI6. Alan explained his concerns. The last few days in the UK had been tense, not because he had been asked to do anything (he hadn&apos;t) but because the atmosphere in the mosques was uncomfortable. He had been in three mosques in Manchester in the last week. Newcomers were viewed as suspicious. The high profile arrest operations in the UK and the relentless talk of planned terrorist attacks had, in his opinion, heightened the paranoia within these communities with regards to the presence of spies and informers. His access to information on terrorist planning was, unless he was a part of it, just impossible to access.Alan was now eager for clarity and reassurances of how the terms of engagement would work. We went over what he had been doing since arriving in the UK and whom he had met. He had also paid visits to Wigan, Blackpool and Liverpool.  The letter from MI6 to the Libyans explains that Alan was told that he must not reveal to the secret service of the other European country that he had been in contact with British intelligence.  We told Alan that under no circumstances was he to tell [them] of his involvement with us or the Libyans. We would do this when we were ready. We understood the need to do this as soon as possible \u2026 We are now coming to them at the earliest opportunity having assessed that Alan is prepared to work for us.Alan had one more question regarding his security. [We assured him] the protection of the source of the information was always of paramount importance. We were an intelligence service, not a law enforcement agency. Before taking any action on his intelligence we would always discuss it with him first. This was how we worked. Alan was content.  A follow up letter is sent from MI6 to the Libyans in January, 2004, which makes clear that the British have now told the other European country about MI6&apos;s determination to run Alan as an agent.  FAO of Mr Sadeq Krema and Mr Abdul WahidNew year&apos;s greetings from SIS in LondonAfter consultation with your director Mr Musa Kusa we held a meeting with our colleagues to declare our involvement to date in our Anglo-Libyan joint operations [Alan].The [agency] was particulary interested in working with us on this case but agreed to do nothing in approaching the subject until they had had a chance to discuss the matter internally at a senior level.Regards and best wishes for 2004  The South African The file show how the CIA cajoled Gaddafi&apos;s regime to seek the extradition of people it wanted to question about terrorism, but the Libyans did not always take the bait. Correspondence from the agency to Libya shows the US getting increasingly frustrated over Gaddafi&apos;s apparent reluctance to assist in the extradition of a man called Abdullah al-Sairi to Libya. At the time, in December 2003, the man, who was also known variously as Ali Abubaker Tantushhe/Tantouse/Tantush, was being held by police in South Africa. The first letter found in the files, sent on Christmas Eve 2003, is clearly not the first to have been sent by the CIA raising concern. It states:  As your service is aware, al-Sairi has ties to the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) senior leadership, in addition to other extremist groups, and our service is anxious that he be detained and questioned on his terrorist activities. We understand that if an arrangement has not been reached circa 11 January and al-Sairi sent to Libya, al-Sairi may be released.  The Libyans obviously do nothing about it, and a week later, the Americans try again. A second letter is fired off.  Subject: Urgent requestWe urgently request that you provide us with an update on the status of Libya&apos;s efforts to secure the deportation of Abdullah al-Sairi.  The third letter, sent in February 2004, makes it clear the Libyans have still not bothered to act on the CIA demand, and sets out that Tripoli needs &quot;to ensure that Interpol issues an arrest warrant for Tantouse, make a formal extradition request, and provide [the CIA] with a contact.&quot;  Subject: Urgent request for actionWe would like to stress that the South African government will set Tantouse free if the Libyan government does not follow through with the South African government within 45 days through diplomatic channels.We look forward to continuing to work with you on this important matter.  On 1 March, the Libyans have still not acted, so a fourth letter is sent to Tripoli, again marked &quot;Urgent/Libya only&quot;  The government of South Africa and the South African police service [SAPS] have communicated to us that they are eager to extradite Ibrahim Ali Abubaker Tantush \u2013 aka Abdullah al-Sairi.We note that a bail hearing is scheduled for 9 March, 2004. Although bail will be denied, we are concerned that al-Sairi&apos;s lawyers have been attempting to generate media interest in the extradition, claiming it is illegal. In addition, an internet site has been created to draw attention to the case. We encourage your representatives to contact SAPS as soon a possible.  After the fourth letter, the trail goes cold. It is unclear what happened to the prisoner. Another CIA document sent to Libya on 15 April, 2004, calls for the Libyans to take custody of another alleged LIFG member who the Americans have captured. The document does not say how the US got him, or where. But the letter makes clear that Tripoli is expected to act, and then to allow the Americans access to him. On this occasion, it asks for the prisoner&apos;s human rights to be protected.  Our service is in a position to deliver [him] to your physical custody, similar to what we have done with other senior LIFG members in the recent past.In addition, per our recently developed agreements, we require that your service agree to take our requirements for debriefings \u2026 as well as a guarantee that [his] human rights will be protected.  Questioning of prisoners about Libya Islamic Fighting Group The CIA had a particular interest in a man called Mustafa Mohamed Krer, said to be a leading member of the LIFG. He had been living in Canada, but appears to have returned to Libya in 2002 after being promised that he would not be arrested when he got back. He was. The CIA wanted to know more about him and his associates, sending Libya a list of 59 questions set out on six separate pages. There is no rider to the request regarding the prisoner&apos;s human rights. The first set of questions focus on one man. The nature of the questions make it clear that the CIA regarded the LIFG as an extremist group, with possible links to al-Qaida.  Our service would be most appreciative if you would pose the following questions to Mustafa Mohamed Krer.3) Did [the man] ever serve as an agent of al-Qaida or the LIFG?14) (If subject answers affirmative) In what capacity did said individual serve as agent. And what were his functions?24) How do you know about [his] training in Afghanistan?27) Do you know anyone who was trained in Afghanistan and is now in the United States?30) After you left North America, who assumed the leadership of the LIFG?  Then the letter asks for questions to be posed on another alleged associate, whom the Americans provide six aliases for and a photo.  15) Did [the alleged associate] appear in a videotape in either Denver and/or Los Angeles that would cause him concern with respect to the reaction of the government of Libya or the Libyan security services?17) Did [the alleged associate] travel to the United Kingdom to meet with LIFG operatives?25) Where has [the alleged associate] travelled overseas since he came to the United States in 1979?26) What role does [a car dealership in Los Angeles] play on behalf of the LIFG support group?  Information from Libya about LIFG members Tony Blair&apos;s visit to Libya on 24 March 2004 was the moment that officially brought Libya back into the international fold, but the documents show that for months before then, the CIA and MI6 had been swapping intelligence about possible terrorist suspects, focusing particularly on members of the LIFG. One document, titled On MS exchange settings, shows that Tripoli had, by then, provided Interpol with a list of &quot;130 Libyan individuals suspected of terrorist/criminal activities.&quot; Dated 4 February 2004 the document is marked &quot;Urgent \u2013 to all member countries&quot;.  IP [Interpol] Tripoli submitted to IPSG/Fusion Task Force a list of 130 individuals belonging to Libya terrorist groups and especially the Libyan Fighting Group \u2013 (from 1-115) \u2026 A criminal analysis of this terrorist group \u2026 is available on the Restricted/Fusion Taskforce website.  Interpol says it is &quot;seeking updates and information&quot; and apologises for the fact it can only provide &quot;year of birth of individual, but you will find their mother&apos;s name which can help to identify them.&quot; Of the 130 names in the subsequent documents, 59 of them are said to be based in the UK. MI6/MI5 and the sharing of intelligence In June 2003 \u2013 almost a year before Blair&apos;s summit with Gaddafi, MI5 sent the Libyans three pages of information it held on eight Libyan dissidents. The letter makes clear that this is not the first contact between MI5 and Tripoli.  Greetings from the British security service. We wish to extend our thanks to you for the detailed and very useful information that you have been sharing with us during our meetings in October last year and January this year. We have been working through this information and wish to share with you information that might be of interest.  MI6 was keen for information flowing the other way. An undated document, which appears to have been sent by MI6 to Sadiq Krema, sets out the concerns that British intelligence has on the increasing involvement and influence of north African extremists in al-Qaida. It mentions the ricin plot \u2013 in which six suspects were arrested in the UK in early 2003. One man was convicted in connection with this, and also convicted of killing a police officer who had come to arrest him. Four other men faced trial over the plot and were cleared. The agency included details of eight men that it regarded to be key north-African extremists, and asked for whatever information the Libyans held.  North African networks in PakistanThe arrests in Pakistan of high profile AQ [al-Qaida] members like Khalid Sheikh Muhammad have left gaps in the organisation and it appears that the north Africans have risen through the ranks and are now taking a more active role in planning terrorist attacks. The extent of their involvement in current acts of terrorism has been highlighted by the detentions in the UK in December 2002 of North Africans, mainly Algerians, who were planning to mount attacks in the UK using poison ricin. We know that this ricin cell was connected to Peshawar based north-African extremists. Funding North-African extremists receive most of their funding from small organisations such as al-Jam&apos;at al-Ismailia al-Moqatila.The common theme in this far reaching north-African network is the Derunta camp [in Afghanistan], where many of the key members carried out military explosives and poisons training. We would be interested to hear your service&apos;s read-out of north-Africans in Peshawar.  Libya and Iraq There are numerous documents in the bundle that show how the CIA and MI6 were prepping the Libyans for visits by the International Atomic Energy Authority in 2003 and 2004, so that the organisation could give the country a clean bill of health over its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programme. The Americans were also keen to find out if any Iraqi scientists who had fled to Libya could shed any light on Saddam Hussein&apos;s own WMDs, which they had failed to find. Desperate for any clues to their whereabouts, the CIA sent this letter on 6 April 2004.  Subject: Iraqi scientistsYou will recall that during the February meeting you had kindly offered us the opportunity to interview several Iraqis that were currently living in Libya. We propose our officers travel to Libya to hold debriefings together with your officers of the individuals you are able to make available \u2026 Should the debriefings provide new knowledge of access into any of the Iraqi WMD programs, we would like to potentially offer suggestions as next steps we might take together \u2026 We wish to convey an urgency on our part to conduct these debriefings as the transfer of sovereignty in Iraq is scheduled to take place in only weeks.  Abdul Hakim Belhaj Now the head of security in Tripoli, Belhaj told earlier this week how he and his wife were flown from Bangkok to Tripoli in 2004 on a rendition flight organised by the CIA. The documents found in Tripoli show that the CIA were very keen to speak to Belhaj, who was also known as Abu Abdullah al-Sadiq. The first document to mention him is dated 4 March 2004, and is a memo to Tripoli from the CIA. It states: &quot;Our service is committed to rendering the terrorist Abu Abdullah al-Sadiq to your custody.&quot; Two days later, there is further correspondence.  Subject: Planning for the Capture and Rendition of Abdullah Al-SadiqThe Malaysian government has informed us that they are putting Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) leader Abdullah al-Sadiq and his pregnant (four months) wife on a commercial flight from Kuala Lumpur to London via Bangkok on the evening of 7 March, 2004.We are planning to arrange to take control of the pair in Bangkok and place them in an aircraft for a flight to your country. It is vital that one of your officers accompany al-Sadiq and his wife \u2026 in order to provide legal custody of al-Sadiq&apos;s spouse. We request that your officers in Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok refrain from making further requests of the Malaysians on this matter.We also appreciate your allowing our service direct access to Al-Sadiq for debriefing purposes once he is in your custody. Please be advised that we must be assured that al-Sadiq will be treated humanely and that his human rights will be respected.It is our standard practice that our officers cannot condone any significant physical or physiological aspects, such as direct physical contacts, unusual mental duress, unusual physical restraints or deliberate environmental deprivations beyond those reasonably required to ensure the security and safety of our officers and to prevent the escape of the detainees.  A second letter in the same period reiterates that it is &quot;our standard practice that our officers cannot condone any significant physical or physiological aspects such as direct physical contacts, unusual mental duress, unusual physical restraints or deliberate environmental deprivations.&quot; Last week Belhaj claimed he was tortured by CIA agents in Bangkok before being sent back to Tripoli, where he was held in custody for seven years. During that time he said he was repeatedly tortured, and told British officials of his treatment. He has demanded an apology from the UK and American governments and has said he is considering suing for compensation over his treatment.", "publicationDate": "2011-09-09T15:10:25Z", "tags": ["Libya", "MI6", "CIA", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa", "US national security", "US news", "UK news", "Foreign policy", "Politics", "World news", "Espionage"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/09/libya-papers-tripoli-mi6-cia", "title": "The Libya papers: a glimpse into the world of 21st-century espionage", "sentences": ["Abdul Hakim Belhaj Now the head of security in Tripoli, Belhaj told earlier this week how he and his wife were flown from Bangkok to Tripoli in 2004 on a rendition flight organised by the CIA.", "Subject: Planning for the Capture and Rendition of Abdullah Al-SadiqThe Malaysian government has informed us that they are putting Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) leader Abdullah al-Sadiq and his pregnant (four months) wife on a commercial flight from Kuala Lumpur to London via Bangkok on the evening of 7 March, 2004.We are planning to arrange to take control of the pair in Bangkok and place them in an aircraft for a flight to your country.", "We request that your officers in Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok refrain from making further requests of the Malaysians on this matter.We also appreciate your allowing our service direct access to Al-Sadiq for debriefing purposes once he is in your custody.", "A second letter in the same period reiterates that it is &quot;our standard practice that our officers cannot condone any significant physical or physiological aspects such as direct physical contacts, unusual mental duress, unusual physical restraints or deliberate environmental deprivations.&quot; Last week Belhaj claimed he was tortured by CIA agents in Bangkok before being sent back to Tripoli, where he was held in custody for seven years."]}, {"article": "A Libyan Islamist has told how he and his family were imprisoned after being &quot;rendered&quot; in an operation MI6 hatched in co-operation with Muammar Gaddafi&apos;s intelligence services. The rendition occurred shortly before Tony Blair paid his first visit to the dictator. Sami al-Saadi, his wife and four children, the youngest a girl aged six, were flown from Hong Kong to Tripoli, where they were taken straight to prison. Saadi was interrogated under torture while his family were held in a nearby cell. &quot;They handcuffed me and my wife on the plane, my kids and wife were crying all the way,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;It was a very bad situation. My wife and children were held for two months, and psychologically punished. The Libyans told me that the British were very happy.&quot; Saadi says he is now considering whether to sue the British government, making him the second Libyan rendition victim to threaten legal proceedings in less than a week. The evidence that the family were victims of a British-led rendition operation is contained in a secret CIA document found in the abandoned office of Moussa Koussa, Gaddafi&apos;s former intelligence chief, in Tripoli last week. In London, meanwhile, an official inquiry into Britain&apos;s role in torture and rendition since 9/11 says the government has provided information about the UK&apos;s role in the affair, and Whitehall sources defended intelligence agencies&apos; actions by saying they were following &quot;ministerially authorised government policy&quot;. It is the first time evidence has emerged that the British intelligence agencies ran their own rendition operation, as opposed to co-operating with those that were mounted by the CIA. Saadi was held for more than six years, during which time he says he was regularly beaten and subjected to electric shocks. Shortly after his arrival in Tripoli, he says, Moussa Koussa visited in person to explain how Gaddafi&apos;s new friends in the west were helping him track down the regime&apos;s opponents around the world. &quot;He told me: &apos;You&apos;ve been running from us, but since 9/11 I can pick up the phone and call MI6 or the CIA and they give us all the information we want on you. You&apos;ve nowhere to hide.&apos;&quot; Saadi, a leading member of a Libyan mujahideen group who was known by the nom de guerre Abu Munthir, was interrogated on one occasion by British intelligence officers, who he alleges did nothing to try to protect him after he told them he was being tortured. The Foreign Office has declined to say whether it knew what became of Abu Munthir&apos;s family as a result of the rendition operation, describing this information as an &quot;intelligence matter&quot;. A spokesman said: &quot;Our position is that it is the government&apos;s longstanding policy not to comment on intelligence matters.&quot; Saadi says he was tricked by the British authorities into travelling to Hong Kong. While in exile in China in March 2004 he approached British intelligence officers via an intermediary in the UK, he says, and was told that he would be permitted to return to London, where he had lived for three years after seeking asylum in 1993. First, however, he would have to be interviewed at the British consulate in Hong Kong, and would be met by British diplomats on his arrival. Saadi flew to Hong Kong with his wife, two sons aged 12 and nine, and two daughters aged 14 and six. They were not met by any British officials but were detained by Chinese border guards over alleged passport irregularities, held for a week and then despatched to Tripoli. Saadi says he always assumed the British were behind his rendition, &quot;working behind the curtain&quot;. Confirmation came when Human Rights Watch, the New York-based NGO, discovered a cache of papers in Moussa Koussa&apos;s abandoned office. Among the documents was a fax that the CIA sent to Tripoli on 23 March 2004. Marked SECRET/US ONLY/EXCEPT LIBYA, it concerns the forthcoming rendition of Saadi and his family. The wording suggests the CIA took no part in the planning of the operation, but was eager to become involved. It says: &quot;Our service has become aware that last weekend LIFG [Libyan Islamic Fighting Group] deputy Emir Abu Munthir and his spouse and children were being held in Hong Kong detention for immigration/passport violations. We are also aware that your service had been co-operating with the British to effect Abu Munthir&apos;s removal to Tripoli, and that you had an aircraft available for this purpose in the Maldives.&quot; It goes on to explain that although Hong Kong had no wish to see a Libyan aircraft land on its territory, &quot;to enable you to assume control of Abu Munthir and his family&quot;, the operation would work if the Libyans were to charter an aircraft registered in a third country, and that the US would assist with the cost. The operation coincided exactly with Tony Blair&apos;s first visit to Libya. Two days after the fax was sent, Blair arrived to shake hands with Gaddafi, and said the two nations wanted to make &quot;common cause&quot; in counter-terrorism operations. It was also announced that Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell had signed a \u00a3550m gas exploration deal. Three days later Saadi and his family were put aboard a private Egyptian-registered jet and flown to Tripoli. Associates of Saadi cannot understand why his capture and interrogation would hold any great intelligence value for the British authorities, and are speculating that he may have been a &quot;gift&quot; from the British to the Gaddafi regime. &quot;On the plane I was told I was going to be electrocuted, hanged,&quot; Saadi said. &quot;When we got to Tripoli my wife and I were in handcuffs, and our legs were tied together using wire and we were hooded. My wife recalls that she thought we were going to be hanged.&quot; Saadi and his family were held initially at a jail in the Tajoura district, which he describes as &quot;Mousa Koussa&apos;s family jail&quot;, and then at Abu Salim jail, a location where prisoners have been murdered and tortured for decades, according to human rights organisations. He says he spent the first 14 months in complete isolation in a cell measuring 6ft by 7ft. &quot;Whenever they felt I was withholding information they would beat me and subject me to electric shocks,&quot; he said. As well as being tortured, he was repeatedly told that his family would be harmed and that he would be killed. The UK was involved in the rendition of another Libyan Islamist earlier the same month. Other papers found among the Tripoli cache show that an MI6 tip-off allowed the CIA to abduct Abdul Hakin Belhaj in Bangkok. Belhaj, who later became a leading figure in the rebel forces that toppled Gaddafi, says he was tortured first by the CIA and then flown to Libya where he suffered severe abuse for several years, being hung from walls and immersed in ice baths. Belhaj says he too was interrogated by MI6 officers, who indicated they knew he was being tortured, but did nothing to help him. On Thursday Belhaj met with British government representatives, who declined to make any apology. He too is considering whether to bring a claim for damages in the UK courts. A number of Whitehall sources have said MI6 was complying with &quot;ministerially authorised government policy&quot; when Saadi and his family and Belhaj were rendered to Libya. However, the Foreign Office, Cabinet Office and Downing Street are all declining to say which department&apos;s ministers authorised the operations. A spokesman for Tony Blair said he knew nothing about the matter. Jack Straw, who was foreign secretary at the time, said he welcomed the fact that an inquiry headed by Sir Peter Gibson would be examining the matter but did not answer questions about whether he had authorised the operation. The inquiry headed by Gibson, a retired judge, that has been established to examine Britain&apos;s role in the mistreatment of terrorism suspects since 9/11, says that it was informed about the UK&apos;s involvement in the removal of Saadi from Hong Kong before the discovery of the Libyan government documents last weekend. It is unclear how much detail has been passed over to the inquiry staff. It may be difficult for former ministers and intelligence officers to tell Gibson that they could not have expected Belhaj and Saadi and his family to be mistreated after they were handed over to Gaddafi&apos;s government. The use of torture had been well-documented by human rights groups, while the Foreign Office&apos;s human rights report for 2004 (pdf) states: &quot;The UK remains seriously concerned by the human rights situation in Libya, including restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly, political prisoners, arbitrary detention and conditions in Libyan prisons.&quot; It added that the British were very keen to see Libya sign international agreements against torture.", "publicationDate": "2011-09-09T17:04:03Z", "tags": ["MI6", "Rendition", "Libya", "Foreign policy", "Muammar Gaddafi", "Moussa Koussa", "CIA", "US news", "Politics", "World news", "UK news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/09/how-mi6-family-gaddafi-jail", "title": "How MI6 deal sent family to Gaddafi's jail", "sentences": ["Other papers found among the Tripoli cache show that an MI6 tip-off allowed the CIA to abduct Abdul Hakin Belhaj in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Among the pressing challenges facing the new government of Thailand, brought to power by the July elections, is the fact that Bangkok is steadily sinking. The gloomiest forecasts suggest parts of the Thai capital may be underwater by 2030, but experts are also critical of the lack of any clear policy to prevent impending disaster. Several factors \u2013 climate change, rising sea levels, coastal erosion, shifting clay soil \u2013 are threatening the great city on the Chao Phraya delta, founded in 1782 by the first monarch belonging to the Chakri dynasty, which is still ruling today. The population has greatly increased, with about 10 million people now living in the city and its suburbs. Even the weight of the skyscrapers, constantly on the rise in a conurbation in the throes of perpetual change, is contributing to Bangkok&apos;s gradual immersion. Much of the metropolis is now below sea level and the ground is subsiding by 1.5 to 5cm a year. In the medium to long term more than 1m buildings, 90% of which are residential, are under threat from the rising sea level. In due course the ground floors of buildings could be awash with 10cm of water for part of the year, according to the Asian Institute of Technology. In the port of Samunt Prakan, about 15 km downstream from the capital, the residents of detached houses along the river already spend several months a year up to their ankles in water. A joint report published in December by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and Japan&apos;s International Co-operation Agency highlighted the threat from climate change to three Asian megacities: Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City and Manila. Illegal tapping of groundwater is one of the causes of the capital&apos;s misfortunes, according to Jan Bojo, a World Bank expert based there. Not all the specialists endorse this view, but they do agree the situation is bound to deteriorate over the next few years. Smith Dharmasaroja, the head of the National Disaster Warning Centre, is predicting that by 2100 Bangkok will have become a new Atlantis. Dharmasaroja&apos;s forecasts are taken seriously: in the 1990s he predicted the fearful tsunami that devastated countries around the Indian Ocean in 2004. Dharmasaroja maintains that &quot;no decision has been taken&quot; at government level &quot;to stop the problem&quot;. And, he adds, if nothing is done Bangkok could be underwater by 2030. One of the solutions he has suggested is to build a series of dykes along the coast of the Gulf of Thailand, a scheme that would cost over $2bn. He says work should start immediately, otherwise it will be too late to halt the chain of events leading to disaster. Anond Snidvongs, an oceanographer and specialist on climate-change impacts in south-east Asia, takes a more cautious line. &quot;No one can predict how long it will take for Bangkok to be flooded and how this process will unfold,&quot; he says. He sees no point in building huge dykes. &quot;The rise in sea level is not that great and climate change only plays a fairly small part \u2013 about one-fifth \u2013 in the current scenario,&quot; he adds. &quot;It&apos;s pointless,&quot; he stresses, &quot;to try to protect the coastline, which is being eroded by three to four centimetres a year. But there are plenty of other ways of combating flooding, such as better management of building land in the city.&quot; Niramon Kulsrisombat, a town planner and lecturer in urban and regional planning at Chulalongkorn University, confirms that &quot;floods have always occurred, Bangkok having been built on sodden terrain 1.5 metres below sea level&quot;. A network of khlongs (canals), fields and allotments used to soak up flooding, but with recent urbanisation many buildings have taken their place and the water is trapped. &quot;Government efforts have focused on raising barriers 2.8 metres high along various stretches of the Chao Phraya,&quot; Kulsrisombat explains, &quot;but this has just done even more damage to the traditional appearance of a settlement where people lived on the water in houses on stilts.&quot; Snidvongs thinks the key factor in saving the city is co-ordinating measures. &quot;We absolutely need to achieve a consensus so that the million or so people who will be directly affected by flooding in the medium or long term can agree on the principles underpinning any solutions,&quot; he says. In short, the scientists who spend their time scrutinising Bangkok must tighten up their diagnosis, the better to prepare for rescuing the Thai capital.

For one of the world&apos;s pre-eminent slapheads, he&apos;s seriously tufty. It&apos;s not just the stubble, which creeps over his chops like someone&apos;s dipped him in iron filings up to the ears. It&apos;s the scalp: all smothered in a fluffy buzzcut. Would he ever grow it out? &quot;Ha ha ha! Which one? Which hair? Ha ha ha!&quot; He goes pink and coughs on his espresso. It&apos;s like asking Marilyn Monroe if she&apos;d consider going back to brunette. Statham knows which side his bread is buttered, and he&apos;s sticking with being a baldie, even if it means a lot of shaving. The other surprise is the giggles. On screen, he&apos;s a committed frowner. And it&apos;s that grizzly commitment to glaring and bone-crunching that&apos;s made him so internationally bankable. No matter what language you speak, you can decipher Statham (general gist: &quot;Don&apos;t mess. I will kill you&quot;). In the flesh, though, he&apos;s more Bruce Forsyth than Bruce Willis: sweet-eyed, gleaming-teethed, with a keen ear for innuendo and a frankly mucky\u00a0chuckle. We&apos;re on the ninth floor of a hotel in Toronto, and he&apos;s counting down until the final interview of the day in aid of his new film, Killer Elite. It&apos;s a brooding assassin smackdown in which Statham takes top billing above Robert De Niro and Clive Owen. As the tagline \u2013 &quot;May the best man live&quot; \u2013 suggests, it&apos;s basically the same old flick with the same old schtick: the Stath tops baddies, boffs toffs (he&apos;s a one-man manifesto for geezer supremacy), and cops off with a blondie. This last element has long been the least essential: in Killer Elite, romance is relegated to a soft-focus flashback showing how a friendly Shelia is keeping the home-fires burning on his Aussie ranch (it&apos;s an Oz co-production) while he dispatches one last job. The logic must run that if you&apos;re watching a Statham film, you either already fancy him, or fancy being him, or possibly both. Slushy details are extraneous. And, indeed, there aren&apos;t a lot here: meet, barbie, banter, snog. The twist the Killer Elite publicity promises is that Statham&apos;s character is slightly gooier than previously in his repertoire. This manifests itself as a bit of a grimace when a kiddie pops up in front of his gun, a tut when colleagues show a lack of concern for collateral damage. &quot;The Bank Job was my last sort of adult film that required a few more layers,&quot; he says, his voice as blasted as Frank Butcher&apos;s. &quot;For years I&apos;ve been wanting to do something that has a bit more of a dramatical drive, and combine it with some action. The character is a lot more conflicted than anything else I&apos;ve done. He&apos;s living a life and his relationship is flourishing, and all of a sudden he&apos;s in a place he doesn&apos;t want to be. But he has to save his mentor [De Niro&apos;s character]. So I think that gives rise to a lot more requirements from me as an actor.&quot; Maybe so. Yet a moral code has long been a key factor in the Statham formula. Even in Crank and its sequel, where he has to keep pounding around town, necking drugs, having sex and killing people to keep his adrenaline up lest he expire (it&apos;s a long story), he doesn&apos;t slaughter anyone who doesn&apos;t appear to deserve it. In most of his roles, from the Transporter trilogy to Death Race, his killings are born from a sense of justice, as well as a weary eagerness to get the job done, and quick. Statham&apos;s genius lies in repetition. He is to action movies what the Chinese Sung ceramicists were to pots, producing ever more perfect repeat ware with only the subtlest variation over long periods of time. He&apos;s like the craftsmen who spent a lifetime making the same Windsor chairs with ever more economy and finesse, rather than trying to develop a new design. If your beat-em-up act ain&apos;t broke, why fix it? Time moves one way, though, and Killer Elite is persistently interested in how long Statham&apos;s character can maintain both his ability and stomach for the work. So how long can Statham himself keep it up? His eyes widen. &quot;That reminds me of another film I did! Ha ha ha. As long as it lasts. As long as people keep going. There&apos;s a shelf life for everything, I suppose, but you have to keep people guessing \u2013 well, not so much that \u2026 As long as you make entertaining films, that&apos;s the goal. And as long as people get their money&apos;s worth they&apos;ll go back, and if they don&apos;t you&apos;ll be on the shelf like many others.&quot; With every line, it&apos;s a little clearer why he&apos;s so popular. We warm to him in the same way we do to Michael Caine: we trust him to deliver an evening out that won&apos;t make us regret reaching into our wallets. It&apos;s not just his talent we&apos;ve faith in, it&apos;s his taste, too. You know what you&apos;re going to get with the Stath \u2013 no funny business. He recognises his power as a pusher comes from consumer savvy. &quot;If I have to hang my hat on something and say, &apos;That&apos;s what I&apos;m driven to go and see as a punter and not an actor&apos;, then this is the kind of film I love. It&apos;s the kind of film I wanna make on a selfish level.&quot; Statham was born in Chesterfield 44 years ago, and earned his first paycheque flogging knock-offs at a market stall. After a career as a diver (he was once 12th in the world), he did a touch of modelling for French Connection, where he was spotted by Guy Ritchie and invited to join Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels on the promise that Ritchie would cook him a part \u2013 a tough guy hawking black-market bits and bobs out of a briefcase \u2013\u00a0that wouldn&apos;t prove too challenging. Then came Snatch, in which he out-acted Brad Pitt, and the rest is history. Next up, Statham is reprising his role as Lee Christmas in The Expendables 2, which starts shooting in Bangkok in a fortnight. What separates him from his wheezy co-stars is that he&apos;s the only one who has kept his career entirely grounded in reality. Yes, there&apos;s been fantasy, but there&apos;s never been an actual superhero. &quot;Me in a cape?&quot; he says. &quot;I don&apos;t fancy that. Tight tights? Nah! I don&apos;t think that&apos;s right for me. I just respond more to true\u00a0stories, that&apos;s my flavour.&quot; He&apos;s cagey about how much of his screen persona these days is him, and how much is just more filling in that template created for him 13 years ago. &quot;I dunno. Luckily, I get to play some good bits that make people think I&apos;m tough. Who knows! Ha ha ha! I just gravitate to those more testosterone-filled sort of parts than me playing something a bit more fairy-like.&quot; We talk for a ridiculously short time. Statham doesn&apos;t really do interviews; or, rather, he doesn&apos;t do any longer than 15 minutes. He professes scepticism with celebrity culture. &quot;I try and keep my stuff private. Especially now with all the shite magazines \u2013 people wanna write about what fucking shoes you&apos;re wearing. I don&apos;t want to be a part of that world. It&apos;s just too much, it&apos;s a headache. Once you expose your private life, if you give one little bit, the floodgates are open and everyone&apos;s got a free range for you.&quot; But you also suspect it&apos;s part of a wider strategy. For someone whose USP is cards-on-the-table openness, Statham is a man with no small mystique. And that&apos;s cultivated partly by not doing press, not giving himself the opportunity to put his foot in it. His most in-depth encounter seems to be a 2007 one with Men&apos;s Health magazine: on the surface, a laddish account of a weight-loss workout programme (&quot;You&apos;re crying for air. It redlines the heart into oblivion&quot;) but one that also gives insight into the enormous off-stage peddling required to be an action star. A few years back, he says, Statham wasn&apos;t so concerned about diet. &quot;I never gave a fuck about a calorie. An apple? It&apos;s good for me. I&apos;d have five. Bananas? Eat the bunch.&quot; But these days he sticks to a six small meals, 2,000 calories per day. And anything that goes into his mouth also gets recorded in a little black journal. &quot;Writing everything down makes it impossible for you to muck\u00a0it up.&quot; He&apos;s not mucked it up today \u2013 he&apos;s not really been given the opportunity. But I&apos;m not sure he would anyway. He&apos;s nice: plain and simple, funner than on screen \u2013 more of a titch, more of a tease. &quot;See ya, darlin&apos;!&quot; is his chirpy cheerio. Once the Stath is forced off that action star treadmill, it&apos;s comedy he should give a run for its money.

So for me Gosling and Refn deserve every plaudit they&apos;re likely to get. But I hope the garlands get shared out just a little. Certainly, it&apos;s tempting to see Drive as a two-man show: Gosling is currently enjoying a serious professional moment while Refn has matured into a film-maker of real grace and precision. Theirs is also quite the double act off screen \u2013 Gosling insisting Refn be hired in the first place, Refn talking of the production that followed as &quot;all about me and Ryan&quot;. Press chores found the pair yucking it up together, while the future involves at least two further collaborations, a long-gestating remake of Logan&apos;s Run and the Bangkok-set Only God Forgives. It&apos;s a friendship for which beautiful may be too small a word. And yet it&apos;s not all Drive has to offer. For one thing there&apos;s Carey Mulligan, with whom Gosling shares all manner of longing glances and half-concealed smiles. But as vital to the film as its winsome sweethearts are a notably more gnarled trio without whom it wouldn&apos;t have nearly the same darkly gleaming allure. For anyone with a yen for the grizzled character actor, Drive is nigh-on pornographic. Yes, there in the role of menacing heavy is Ron Perlman, lately a leading man of sorts in Hellboy, but here returned to his natural home to the side of centre stage, that vast, improbable face looming out of the story like an Easter Island statue. Then comes Bryan Cranston, a fine actor only now getting his dues in his mid-50s after starring in the masterfully black TV show Breaking Bad, cannily employed here not just for his new marketability but a persuasive air of shit-magnet victimhood. And last, most impressive of all, there&apos;s Albert Brooks, playing bluff and brutal and very much against comic type. It&apos;s a performance that reminds you of his bald-wigged turn as a white-collar convict in another wonderfully smart thriller from another decade, Steven Soderbergh&apos;s Out of Sight (1998) \u2013 but here his role is even more pivotal, the result being that he&apos;s the one of Drive&apos;s supporting actors I&apos;d back to pick up a gong or two in awards season. I hope so anyway. Gosling and Mulligan get the big displays of human tenderness, but the work being carried out around them is often awesomely delicate \u2013 the various tics and eccentricities of the three older men a delight to watch but the result never once tipping over into the cartoonish. The eye is drawn with a knowing bit of actorly business, but always allowed to return to the main attraction. Scenes aren&apos;t stolen as much as playfully shared out and passed around. It&apos;s a glorious reminder that no movie can live by beautiful film stars alone: go too far down that road and you end up with The Tourist. Whereas Drive is doubly blessed, a showcase for a bona fide movie star that will also delight connoisseurs of the supporting cast \u2013 for me one of the true pleasures of film. In the performances of Perlman, Cranston and Brooks, I think you can trace a line of descent to the greats of the form: the eternally world-weary Yaphet Kotto, comic genius Thelma Ritter, Camberwell&apos;s insanely versatile Claude Rains, the tireless Brad Dourif and Paul Giamatti. So in the next few months as Gosling and Refn soak up the adulation, I&apos;d like to think the three old pros who do so much to bring their movie to life will also see a little love. I&apos;ll be even happier if Hossein Amini&apos;s script and James Sallis&apos;s original novel find at least a few supporters, but writers getting their due credit ... well, let&apos;s not ask for miracles.", "publicationDate": "2011-09-16T13:35:03Z", "tags": ["Nicolas Winding Refn", "Ryan Gosling", "Film", "Carey Mulligan", "Culture", "Thriller"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/sep/16/ryan-gosling-drive-supporting-actors", "title": "Move over Ryan Gosling: Drive's supporting actors grab the wheel", "sentences": ["Press chores found the pair yucking it up together, while the future involves at least two further collaborations, a long-gestating remake of Logan&apos;s Run and the Bangkok-set Only God Forgives."]}, {"article": "Bruno Melling-Firth, Conrad Quashie and Max Boomgaarden-Cook were four days into their Thai adventure when, on the evening of 27 June, they boarded an overnight bus in Bangkok to take them along the backpacker trail to Chiang Mai. The three friends, all 19 and from south London, had been saving for the best part of a year to pay for the nine-week trip, Conrad and Bruno waiting on tables in a cafe, Max working as a lifeguard near his home in Brixton. After backpacking through Thailand, they were hoping to see Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam before returning to take up places at university. Conrad&apos;s girlfriend of four years had also been travelling in the region, and overlapped for a few days in the Thai capital before she waved her friends off at the bus station and caught a flight home. She was met at Heathrow by her parents, who told her the bus had been involved in a collision with another coach, and all three friends were dead. Almost three months after that shocking tragedy, the mothers of the three young men say they are still, at times, barely able to speak of the events of that night. The scale of the loss to the boys&apos; close-knit families and large group of friends, has, says Max&apos;s mother, Polly Cook, been &quot;the most bewildering, confusing, painful, difficult thing. It&apos;s unimaginable.&quot; But despite their grief, the three women \u2013 Cook, Conrad&apos;s mother, Amanda Bean, and Gillian Melling, mother of Bruno \u2013 have chosen to speak out in an attempt to raise awareness about road safety in Thailand, in particular on its overnight buses. Given the country&apos;s popularity as a backpacker destination, the women say they are dismayed at how little is known of its poor road safety record. &quot;They had been there for four days,&quot; says Melling, an artist. &quot;I had had one email from him. And four days later, that was it. They were dead. &quot;And we just, all of us, feel that everybody should know about travelling at night-time about the buses. Because it&apos;s only since [the accident that] we&apos;ve heard how dangerous it is. Every parent and every young person should know that you don&apos;t go on the buses at night. We didn&apos;t know. They didn&apos;t know.&quot; Conrad and Bruno had been at school together since they were 11, meeting Max in sixth form, and forming part of a sprawling, lively and \u2013 as has been amply demonstrated since their deaths \u2013 devoted group of friends in south London. All three were &quot;huge personas&quot;, says Melling, on the brink of &quot;properly turning into young men. Really gorgeous young men.&quot; According to police statistics, almost 13,000 people were killed on Thai roads in 2005, though some believe the figure may be closer to 20,000 (the UK equivalent last year, for a roughly similar population, was 2,222). While the dangers of hiring motorbikes in Thailand is better known, little specific information is available about bus transport, even though the Thai travel industry&apos;s trade publication TTR has described the road between Bangkok and Chiang Mai as &quot;notorious for speeding and bus drivers [who are] often under the influence of alcohol, pep pills and drugs&quot;. Accidents are frequent, it observed, and corruption among rogue operators rife. The Foreign Office says that it has changed its advice, following the accident, to stress the increased risks of road travel, including coach travel, in Thailand. There is not enough evidence, according to a spokesman, to know whether night-time travel is more perilous, as the women believe. The Association of British Travel Agents said most tour operators used only firms they had come to trust over time, but there was a limit to the help they could offer independent travellers. Trailfinders, too, said that passengers simply buying flights through the company, as the three young men did, would not be given specific road safety advice unless they asked for it. The Thai tourist board referred queries to its website; driving at night is described as &quot;extremely hazardous&quot;. Particularly distressing for the mothers is the fact that the circumstances of the accident remain unclear. Much of their information comes from another friend who was travelling with the three boys but who escaped with comparatively light physical injuries (his family have asked for his name not to published). But from what they have learned, the friends opted to take a cheaper local bus, rather than the state-run travel service, which tends to operate larger, modern coaches. TTR recommends avoiding buses altogether and taking the train to Chiang Mai \u2013 &quot;slower but definitely safer&quot;. The ragged hole left by the deaths of three such charismatic and deeply loved young men is impossible for their mothers to articulate. Bruno, the second of three siblings and &quot;our glue, definitely&quot;, according to his mother, had discovered a talent and passion for photography and was due to start at Glasgow School of Art in a few weeks. He had begun a photography project capturing the construction of the Shard skyscraper in London. Since his death Melling has stepped in \u2013 &quot;I don&apos;t know how [his camera] works, so I put it on automatic&quot; \u2013 to complete the project. Conrad was also the second of three siblings, gentle, generous to a fault, and &quot;very laid-back and relaxed&quot;, according to Bean. &quot;His favourite phrase to me was always &apos;Chill mum, chill,&apos; because I fussed about everything.&quot; A gifted child, he was not always as motivated as he could be, his mother admits with a smile, &quot;but actually, now I think, well, you spent time with your friends. I&apos;m glad that he did that now.&quot; His great love was dubstep music, and the guitar that he played every day. There was always music in the house, says Bean. Cook agrees, it was the same with Max. The silence now is strange, she says. Shortly after the three young men died, a freelance journalist, who had contributed to the Guardian, tweeted that she had smiled when she heard of the boys&apos; deaths, assuming from their names that they were from privileged backgrounds. The three women don&apos;t want to talk about the incident, other than to say it was particularly offensive since their names reflected not wealth but the fact that all three sets of parents had separated when their children were young, and Cook and Melling wanted their children to have their names too. In fact, all three boys had substantially paid their own way on the trip. Cook, who like Bean teaches refugees in Lambeth, had encouraged Max to take his lifeguarding job after a badly broken leg ended a hugely promising sporting career. The oldest of four brothers, he loved Tolkien, Banksy and hip hop and was planning to study politics and history, which he loved, at Manchester Metropolitan University, where Conrad had also won a place. He was &quot;full of energy and love for life and love for his friends&quot;, says his mother. She is in the early stages of setting up a charity, currently called the Max Boomgaarden-Cook Foundation, but shortly to be renamed MBC to reflect the three friends&apos; initials, to promote art and sport among young people in their community. Bean asked for friends to support Kids Company, which works with vulnerable children across London, in Conrad&apos;s memory. As Melling stresses, however, a key priority for all three is to ensure the risks on Thai roads are better understood. In the months since their deaths, the boys&apos; friends and their three longterm girlfriends have been &quot;amazing&quot;, say the women, helping with practical tasks, organising picnics in memory of the boys, and sending scores of photos, some of which, the women smile, were never intended for a mother to see. &quot;There are so many photos of the three of them together,&quot; says Bean, &quot;and in every picture they have their arms around each other. They are all having fun, all the time.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2011-09-16T18:30:22Z", "tags": ["UK news", "Thailand", "Backpacking holidays", "Travel", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/sep/16/thailand-mothers-memory-sons", "title": "Thailand deaths: Three mothers work to honour the memory of their sons", "sentences": ["Bruno Melling-Firth, Conrad Quashie and Max Boomgaarden-Cook were four days into their Thai adventure when, on the evening of 27 June, they boarded an overnight bus in Bangkok to take them along the backpacker trail to Chiang Mai.", "While the dangers of hiring motorbikes in Thailand is better known, little specific information is available about bus transport, even though the Thai travel industry&apos;s trade publication TTR has described the road between Bangkok and Chiang Mai as &quot;notorious for speeding and bus drivers [who are] often under the influence of alcohol, pep pills and drugs&quot;."]}, {"article": "Fears that a fake CIA vaccination scheme created to hunt Osama bin Laden has compromised the operations of aid agencies in Pakistan have intensified after it emerged that a major NGO was forced to evacuate its staff following warnings about their security. Save the Children flew eight expatriate aid workers out of Pakistan in late July after receiving a warning from US officials at the Peshawar consulate. Two senior local staff were moved into five-star hotels in Islamabad. Western and Pakistani officials say there were fears that Save the Children staff could be picked up by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) over alleged links to Dr Shakil Afridi, the Pakistani doctor at the heart of the covert CIA vaccination scheme that helped locate Bin Laden. Save the Children vehemently denies any links to the CIA scheme, which the Guardian first reported in July, and said it was the victim of a broader crackdown on aid agencies in Pakistan caused by CIA tactics. &quot;Dr Afridi never worked for Save the Children and his alleged activities were not in any way connected with us. We did not have a vaccination programme in Abbottabad,&quot; said a spokeswoman, Ishbel Matheson, in London. The charity did have a passing connection with Afridi, however, which may explain the ISI scrutiny of its activities. Afridi participated in two health-worker training courses run by Save the Children in 2008 and 2010, Matheson confirmed. Pakistan&apos;s ministry of health nominated him for participation, she added. The training courses were part of a US-funded child health programme in the tribal belt along the Afghan border that Save the Children has been running since 2007. ISI suspicions were also stoked by Afridi himself. A senior western official said Afridi told his wife he was working for Save the Children when he was in fact running the fake CIA programme. The allegation emerged during interrogation. A senior aid worker corroborated that account, saying Afridi may have mentioned Save the Children &quot;during the early stages of his interrogation&quot;. Save the Children said it was horrified that Afridi had abused its name. &quot;We are shocked by the allegations that our name has been falsely used in this way. Save the Children&apos;s work in Pakistan is helping the most vulnerable children and their families,&quot; said Matheson. Furious aid workers say the CIA&apos;s reckless use of aid work as a cover by spy agencies has threatened the safety of genuine aid workers and endangered multimillion-pound programmes to help Pakistan&apos;s poor. Save the Children has 2,000 employees in Pakistan and assisted 7 million people in 2010, half of whom were caught in massive floods while the remainder benefited from long-term development programmes. After the security threat in late July, those activities slowed or juddered to a halt. Staff were temporarily transferred out of sensitive areas, such as the Swat valley. British and American diplomats interceded with the authorities, offering assurances of the charity&apos;s bona fides. Two weeks later in mid-August, after receiving a green light from the ISI, Save the Children sent a handful of expatriate staff who had been staying in Bangkok back to Pakistan. The two local employees, who had been staying at the Serena hotel, returned home. The ISI learned of the CIA vaccination scheme after US Navy Seals burst into the house on 2 May, killing Bin Laden. Immediately afterwards, the spy agency began an intensive drive to understand how the CIA had operated in the town \u2013 and whether any western aid workers had helped it. Three weeks later Afridi was arrested on the outskirts of Peshawar. Western aid agencies, especially those with American employees or US government funding, started to come under sharp intelligence scrutiny. A young American aid worker with Catholic Relief Services was put on trial for visa irregularities in the southern city of Sukkur before being deported. Other aid workers were also forced to leave. Since then charities have experienced long delays in obtaining visas, and say shipments of relief goods have suffered inexplicable delays at Karachi port. Others complain of regular visits to their offices from intelligence officials seeking detailed information about their staff. One intelligence document, inadvertently left behind at one aid agency and seen by the Guardian, directs operatives to investigate the &quot;covert funding&quot; and &quot;covert operations&quot; of international NGOs. In July the departing director of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Pascal Cuttat, said Pakistan was becoming increasingly difficult to work in. &quot;We are consistently facing suspicion of any foreigner working in the country,&quot; he told a press conference in Geneva. &quot;To live and work and get permission to do anything has become more difficult. Everyone is struggling with the bureaucracy.&quot; The ICRC is still awaiting permission to bring a new country director into Pakistan. Aid agencies in Pakistan are currently battling massive floods in the southern Sindh province that have affected more than 5 million people. Few aid workers would speak on the record, fearing further recrimination, though some directed their anger at the CIA. InterAction, an alliance of 190 US-based NGOs, has called on the spy agency to stop using humanitarian work as a cover for counter-terrorism. &quot;Such unethical behaviour endangers not only local populations but also the lives of legitimate humanitarian workers,&quot; said the InterAction president, Samuel Worthington. Afridi, meanwhile, is in the custody of Pakistan&apos;s intelligence agencies. A government commission investigating the Bin Laden affair has banned him from leaving Pakistan. The US wants to resettle the Pashtun doctor in America but Pakistani officials say he may be charged with espionage or treason. Meanwhile, Bin Laden&apos;s former house stands empty. On 20 September the press watchdog Reporters Without Borders complained that the government had banned the foreign press from visiting the site, stating that Abbottabad had been placed under &quot;what is in effect a state of emergency&quot;.

As it&apos;s one of the nation&apos;s favourite cuisines, I don&apos;t know whether we need an annual celebration of &quot;over 200 years of Indian restaurants in the UK&quot;, but at least this has a commendable aim of raising funds for hunger- and poverty-related charities. But I found myself irritated with the website&apos;s calls for curry lovers &quot;to get out and visit their local curry houses&quot;. It&apos;s a term I loathe.  I have no idea where it originates - perhaps someone dreamt it up after Sake Dean Mahomed set up the Hindoostane Coffee House in 1810, widely regarded as the UK&apos;s first Indian restaurant. Wherever it comes from, it never fails to irk me when it&apos;s bandied around as a catch-all - it does no justice to the hugely complex and diverse regional cooking of India, never mind Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. &quot;Curry house&quot; lazily lumps all these cuisines together; it&apos;s as ignorant and twee as labelling the different cuisines of Europe &quot;continental&quot;. To me, the outmoded phrase evokes 70s and 80s restaurants with flock wallpaper, piped music, obsequious waiters in bow ties and greasy glow-in-the-dark curries. It belongs to the era before sun-dried tomatoes and mobile phones were commonplace, when ginger and garlic were considered exotic. It conjures images of inexpensive studenty fare made from cheap, nasty ingredients. The UK&apos;s Indian restaurants have moved on dramatically in recent years.  There is much more to south Asian food than curries. You only have to sample the spicy breakfast and brunch dishes at the Painted Heron or the Cinnamon Club; the delicious south Indian dosas and idlis at the unassuming Woodlands chain; the feather-light Gujarati &quot;farsan&quot; snacks at Bradford&apos;s Prashad or Birmingham&apos;s Jyoti&apos;s.  We also have the postmodern Dishoom a tribute to the &quot;Irani cafes&quot; of Mumbai, so pitch-perfect in its execution that it&apos;s even attracted attention in India. Chakra, which opens later this month, boasts an innovative ingredient-led menu of artisanal products from around India \u2013 a first for an Indian restaurant in the UK. And there&apos;s the legendary chocolate samosa at Rasoi. Interesting things are happening in Indian cuisine. There&apos;s Gaggan in Bangkok, which Time magazine hailed earlier this year as the world&apos;s first Indian molecular gastronomy restaurant. The point is, there are so many styles, varieties and genres of Indian restaurants: why would you want to lump them together as curry houses? Proper, traditional (as opposed to modern &quot;urban&quot;) Indian cooking is sophisticated, mysterious, intricate and, yes, can take hours of laborious preparation (there&apos;s no such thing as a &quot;quick and easy 10 minute Indian&quot;). I&apos;ve been learning from my mother all my life and I still haven&apos;t mastered all the nuances.  Indian is up there with French, Chinese and Persian as one of the greatest cuisines in the world. So it&apos;s all the more galling when respected critics ruin their reviews with comments along the lines of &quot;excellent food, but too expensive for an Indian.&quot; Why? Don&apos;t smart, serious Indian restaurants \u2013 whose owners have poured in huge amounts of money and spent sleepless nights worrying over every detail \u2013 not have the right to be expensive?

However, several key political detainees have been kept behind bars, dampening hopes of prominent human right campaigners of a broader amnesty. Relatives of prisoners gathered at jails around the country on Wednesday to await the releases after the country&apos;s new civilian president, without disclosing any names, issued an amnesty for inmates, many of them ordinary criminals. &quot;The freedom of each individual is invaluable, but I wish that all political prisoners would be released,&quot; said Burma&apos;s most prominent pro-democracy campaigner and Nobel peace laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi. A major release of political detainees has been eagerly awaited by Burma&apos;s opposition, as well as foreign governments and the UN, as a gesture toward liberalisation by the elected government after decades of harsh military rule. By midday, about two dozen political prisoners appeared to have been freed, according to interviews with prison officials and families of detainees. A Thai-based group that monitors detainees in Burma, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, said the total was at least 100. But one of the country&apos;s most famous political prisoners, Min Ko Naing, who led a failed 1988 uprising that was crushed by the military, was not freed, according to a prison official and relative. Another prominent member of the so-called 88 Generation Students Group, Ko Ko Gyi, was also believed to be still in prison, the prison official said. About 30 members of the group are in different jails. There were also conflicting reports about a prominent monk who led street protests in 2007, Shin Gambira, with one source saying he had been freed but an activist later saying he had not. Authorities have in the past released dissidents only to detain them again later in crackdowns on democracy activists. One prominent freed dissident was Zarganar, who was arrested in June 2008. He was sentenced to 59 years in a remote prison after criticising Burma&apos;s then-ruling generals for their sluggish response to cyclone Nargis, which killed more than 140,000 people a month earlier. Sai Say Htan, an ethnic Shan leader sentenced to 104 years in prison in 2005 for refusing to take part in drafting a new constitution, was also freed, prison sources and relatives said. Believed to be in his late 70s, Sai Say Htan was a leader of the Shan State Army, which fought for decades against successive military rulers following a 1962 coup. Benjamin Zawacki, Amnesty International&apos;s Burma researcher based in Bangkok, said he was disappointed by early reports of the number of freed political prisoners. &quot;If the preliminary reports hold, it is welcome for what it is, but in the bigger context it is disappointing,&quot; he said. &quot;It would also seem to be a retardation of the rather fast and qualitative political reforms that have been happening in the country. If these numbers are as small as we fear, they might be, it would definitely signify a slowing down of the reforms.&quot; The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, speaking before Burma began the general amnesty for 6,359 inmates, said she was encouraged by &quot;promising signals&quot; of reform but that it was too early to announce steps Washington might take in response. The US, Europe and Australia have said that Burma must free an estimated 2,100 political prisoners before they will even consider lifting sanctions that have crippled the pariah state and, over the years, driven it closer to China. &quot;We&apos;re encouraged by the steps we see the government taking \u2026 We&apos;re going to take them at their word,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;But we want to see actions. And if they are going to release political prisoners, that would be a very positive sign.&quot; The army nominally handed power to civilians in March, though the November elections were ridiculed as a sham to cement authoritarian rule behind a democratic facade. President Thein Sein, a retired general, became the first civilian head of state in half a century. Thein Sein has however made liberal overtures, including moves to win over ethnic minorities, some tolerance of criticism, and instigationg better communication with Aung San Suu Kyi, who was released last year from 15 years of house arrest. An open letter from Burma&apos;s new human rights commission on Tuesday called on the president to free prisoners who did not pose &quot;a threat to the stability of state and public tranquility&quot;. The letter, published in state media, marked a significant shift in the former British colony, where authorities had long refused to recognise the existence of political prisoners, usually dismissing such detainees as common criminals.", "publicationDate": "2011-10-12T08:56:16Z", "tags": ["World news", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/12/burma-political-prisoners-freed-amnesty", "title": "Burma releases some political prisoners in amnesty", "sentences": ["Benjamin Zawacki, Amnesty International&apos;s Burma researcher based in Bangkok, said he was disappointed by early reports of the number of freed political prisoners."]}, {"article": "The jury in the trial of a former Soviet air force officer accused of being one of the world&apos;s most prolific arms dealers is due to begin hearing evidence on Wednesday, after two years of legal wrangling between the US and Russia that ended when he arrived in New York last year. Viktor Bout, whose alleged role in fuelling some of the developing world&apos;s bloodiest conflicts earned him the sobriquet &quot;merchant of death&quot;, will stand trial on weapons trafficking and terrorism charges.  He is accused by the US of conspiring to sell millions of dollars worth of weapons to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) rebels, in order to kill Americans. Farc is designated a terrorist organisation by Washington and the EU. He was seized by the Thai authorities in March 2008, after a sting operation by US agents in a Bangkok hotel, but was only extradited to the US in November 2010. Bout, 44, has pleaded not guilty to the charges and maintains that he was in Thailand on official government business. He claims to be a businessman who ran an air cargo business that specialised in flying to conflict areas.  Bout was arrested after allegedly offering to sell weapons to two American agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration who were posing as Farc rebels. The weapons included surface-to-air missiles, anti-personnel land mines and &quot;ultralight&quot; aircraft that could be fitted with missiles and grenade-launchers. During a covertly-recorded meeting in Thailand on March 6, according to the justice department, Bout told two DEA undercover agents he could arrange to airdrop the arms to Farc in Colombia and offered to sell two cargo planes to the rebel group to transport them. The US say Bout indicated at the meeting that he understood that the agents wanted the arms for use against American personnel and offered to provide people to train Farc in the use of the weapons. He spent two years in a high-security prison in Thailand, while the US and Russia, which opposed his extradition and wanted him returned to Moscow, argued over his fate. Bout, whose life story is said to have inspired the Hollywood film, Lord of War, starring Nicolas Cage, has been linked to a long list of authoritarian regimes and conflicts over the past two decades. Peter Hain, the former British government minister, branded him &quot;Africa&apos;s chief merchant of death&quot; for his involvement in countries such as Angola, Sierra Leone and Sudan. He helped arm the Liberian rebel leader, Charles Taylor, later president who came before the international criminal court for war crimes. In 2005 the US authorities froze the assets of several companies in which Bout had a stake after the Bush administration barred trade with Taylor. The US also alleges that Bout made tens of millions of dollars selling arms to the Taliban when it was governing Afghanistan. The indictment against Bout charges him with four separate terrorism offences. They are conspiracy to kill US nationals; conspiracy to kill US officers or employees; conspiracy to acquire and use an anti-aircraft missile; and conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organisation. If convicted of all charges, Bout faces a mandatory minimum of 25 years in prison and a maximum of life in prison.", "publicationDate": "2011-10-12T11:00:00Z", "tags": ["Viktor Bout", "Arms trade", "Farc", "US news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/12/viktor-bout-trial-arms-smuggling", "title": "Viktor Bout arms smuggling trial due to begin hearing evidence", "sentences": ["He was seized by the Thai authorities in March 2008, after a sting operation by US agents in a Bangkok hotel, but was only extradited to the US in November 2010."]}, {"article": "The Burmese authorities released a handful of prominent dissidents from jail on Wednesday, but kept hundreds more behind bars in what international observers said was an &quot;extremely disappointing sign&quot; that the civilian government was slowing the pace of political change. Despite hopes that an amnesty for more than 6,000 mainstream prisoners would bring freedom for a significant number of political detainees, only 207 had been confirmed as released by nightfall, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a Burmese group based in Thailand. A prison official told Reuters the total number was more like 300, but human rights activists in the region said a lack of political transparency and the remote location of many prisons made the figures difficult to verify. &quot;If the government was hoping to release a certain amount of prisoners as a gesture, it&apos;s fallen far short of expectations,&quot; said David Mathieson, of Human Rights Watch. &quot;They&apos;d led a lot of people to believe it would be more sizeable.&quot; Mark Farmaner, director of the Burma Campaign UK, said the day had been extremely disappointing. &quot;We would say you would need to get well over 500 [political prisoners released] for us to look at this as having some broader political significance,&quot; he said. He added that the previous, notoriously repressive, regime had also carried out minor prisoner releases. &quot;For the government of Burma to back up its claims that it&apos;s changing and that there&apos;s genuine reform, it would need to go beyond what&apos;s happened before \u2013 and it hasn&apos;t done that.&quot; The most high-profile figure released on Wednesday was the comedian Zarganar, who was arrested in 2008 after publicly criticising the authorities&apos; response to Cyclone Nargis, which led to the deaths of 140,000 people. &quot;I don&apos;t feel good because my heart is heavy with the knowledge of those who continue to be kept behind bars,&quot; he told the local newspaper Weekly Eleven, shortly after his release from Myitkyina prison. &quot;Based on my current experiences I dare not think changes are real and big this time either \u2026 the release of prisoners was just a sprinkle, way too little.&quot; Another prominent release was Su Su Nway, who was sentenced to 12 years in jail in 2008. She was the first Burmese citizen to successfully sue local government officials. She was imprisoned in 2005 and jailed again in 2007, after protesting outside the Rangoon hotel where a UN special rapporteur on human rights was staying. Sai Say Htan, an ethnic Shan leader, who was sentenced to 104 years in prison in 2005 for refusing to help draft a new constitution, was also understood to have been freed, in poor health. Aung San Suu Kyi, Burma&apos;s pro-democracy leader, said welcomed all the releases. She told local journalists: &quot;Each one has priceless value. Freedom of a person is priceless.&quot; But the news was not good for most of the country&apos;s well-known political prisoners, estimated by Amnesty International to number about 2,000 people. The student leaders Min Ko Naing and Ko Ko Gyi, who led a failed uprising in 1988, are not thought to have been freed. And the fate of U Gambira, one of the most prominent monks behind the 2007 street protests, was unclear. &quot;I&apos;m hoping he gets released tomorrow,&quot; said Mathieson. Observers had hoped that the amnesty would mark the latest step in the growing liberalisation of Burma, which held widely criticised elections almost a year ago and had a new government installed in March. The regime, led by the former military officer Thein Sein, freed Suu Kyi and has held meetings with her. But activists said his reforming credentials had been undermined by Wednesday&apos;s events. &quot;The limited release today in some way demonstrates a relaxation of the increased political reform,&quot; said Benjamin Zawacki, Amnesty International&apos;s Burma researcher based in Bangkok. &quot;There&apos;s no doubt that in the past several months we&apos;ve seen a series of successive steps whereby there&apos;s been a bit of a political opening \u2026 [but] what&apos;s really happened today is a retardation of the political reform.&quot; Observers maintain that human rights abuses of ethnic minorities are still widespread in Burma.", "publicationDate": "2011-10-12T17:23:59Z", "tags": ["World news", "Aung San Suu Kyi", "Human rights", "Amnesty International", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/12/burmese-dissidents-freedom-few-slowdown", "title": "Burmese dissidents: handful freed 'suggests stalled political reform'", "sentences": ["&quot;The limited release today in some way demonstrates a relaxation of the increased political reform,&quot; said Benjamin Zawacki, Amnesty International&apos;s Burma researcher based in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Andy Murray may be thousands of miles from home but his heart is lodged firmly in the Greenwich peninsula.

After finishing a degree in philosophy at York, and an MPhil in criminology at Cambridge, she published Murder By Numbers, a true crime book, and next thing I knew \u2013 these surprises sneak up on one \u2013 she announced she&apos;d been hired as a tabloid reporter. She did it for five hard years, and published hundreds of pieces. She spent weeks covering the trial of the polymurderous Dr Shipman, the murders of those two poor schoolgirls Holly and Jessica in Cambridgeshire, and the case of eight-year-old Sarah Payne, abducted and killed by a local paedophile. It was a horrific beat, and she was good at it. So good, that her newspaper asked her if she would ghost a book with Sara Payne, Sarah&apos;s mother. She was given four months leave, and met an editor at Hodder to discuss the details. &quot;Could you do 100,000 words in four months?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; The editor got out her diary. &quot;That would make it due October 8th, is that right?&quot; Anna got out hers. &quot;Yeah, that&apos;s right. Do you want it in the morning or the afternoon?&quot; The editor looked at her incredulously. &quot;You can do that?&quot; &quot;Look,&quot; said Anna dismissively, &quot;I&apos;m not a writer, I&apos;m a journalist. I&apos;ll put it down for 9am.&quot; She delivered it on time, and it was remarkably well written, totally convincing, rather moving really. It sold very well. When she told me the story, I asked what she meant by saying she was not a writer? She&apos;d written one book already, published tons of articles, and would certainly be writing others. &quot;It&apos;s just a job of work,&quot; she said. &quot;There&apos;s no art in it, no imagination or creativity, and no fuss. Writers always make a fuss.&quot; This was modest of her, and fair, and made a useful distinction. But it led me to wonder what a writer is, and under what conditions someone might rightly be described as &quot;a writer&quot;. (It won&apos;t help to consult your dictionary, which will only reflect the range of misuse, of the term). You will sense something personal coming. It first hit me a few years ago, after I published Tolkien&apos;s Gown, which was my fourth book, though only my second written in &quot;my own voice&quot;. It got some attention. I went to a few literary festivals, talked on the radio, and forgot for a time that I made my living as a rare book dealer, until my bank manager informed me that I was in danger of ceasing to do so. I promptly got back to (real) work, but also started another book, and fiddled with it intermittently for the next couple of years (it eventually came out as Outside of a Dog). During this period I travelled a lot, as Belinda and I had built a house in New Zealand. We went there at least once a year, stopping off on the way home at various enticing spots (Samoa, the Cook Islands, Singapore, Bangkok, Hong Kong) in which I frequently had to fill out one of those immigration forms that asks your occupation. I normally put &quot;Book Dealer&quot;, but one day I found myself, rather bashfully, putting down &quot;Writer.&quot; I didn&apos;t tell Belinda. The immigration officer didn&apos;t even look at it, to my slight regret (I was ready to tell him what sort of books I write) but it looked great to me. I never did it again, though I still get tempted. Because, for reasons that are not entirely clear to me, I am not at all sure that I am a writer. I have published five books, have two unpublished manuscripts of novels, and am contracted to write two more books over the next three years. When do I get to be a writer? And if all of that doesn&apos;t qualify, what does? Curiously, having a vocation or profession seems to disqualify you, even if you write a lot of books. A well-known lepidopterist, professor of medieval history, or philosopher of science may have a bibliography as long as your arm, but none of them gets called a writer, though they may write very well. So, to be called a writer do you have to be a sort of amateur, not a specialist on something or other? To be without a default topic? That won&apos;t do it though. If it is necessary it certainly isn&apos;t sufficient. You will all know the sort of local person, earnest and both well-meaning and well-intentioned, who goes to evening classes and then paints a lot and produces canvases that fill the garden shed? Or their neighbour, who fills notebooks with verse? When asked, such person will often say, proudly, that they are &quot;a painter&quot;, or &quot;a poet&quot;. And they most obviously are not. Why not? It can&apos;t be a matter of exhibiting and publishing, because (a) sometimes they do, and (b) real poets and painters sometimes don&apos;t. Think of Hopkins, or Van Gogh. There is something honorific in the appellation, then? You get rightly called a poet or painter in recognition of genuine quality? But this doesn&apos;t quite work either. There are bad writers and bad painters (Jeffrey Archer, Jack Vettriano) who still deserve the classification. Nor can it be a matter of simply being dedicated, and spending most of your time in creative activity. You can be a writer, indeed a great writer, while doing a full-time job which takes more time than you spend on literary composition. Think of Trollope, Matthew Arnold, Wallace Stevens, TS Eliot. Part-time writers, if that doesn&apos;t sound dismissive. I&apos;d like to think of myself like that. Uncertain, though, I took my editor aside at a party, and whispered to him conspiratorially. &quot;My dear, I am rather confused.&quot; He looked interested, having suspected this for some time. &quot;I no longer know how to describe myself. Am I a writer?&quot; He was shocked. &quot;Certainly not,&quot; he said. &quot;You are a rare book dealer who also writes books sometimes.&quot; &quot;Yeah, but you just think writers are creative writers.&quot; Bloody novelists. &quot;Not at all,&quot; he said, &quot;surely Alain de Botton is a writer, isn&apos;t he?&quot; Bloody Alain de Botton. &quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;why do I get invited to lots of writers&apos; festivals then?&quot; &quot;Can I be frank?&quot; he asked. &quot;Because they want you to tell all your stories about meeting Graham Greene, and getting sued by JD Salinger, and being rude to Harold Pinter\u2026 and when you start talking about Wittgenstein and DH Lawrence and the formative effects of reading, they keep hoping for another anecdote to pop up\u2026&quot; This had all the dreadful virtues of truth. Why does this matter so much to me? The answer is simple. Being a writer seems to me a better thing than being a book dealer. After Philip Larkin died, Monica Jones had a simple headstone carved, which gave his name and dates, underneath which it simply says &quot;Writer&quot;. That seems to me elegant, and moving, and a perfect summing up of an important career, even if I&apos;m still not certain, quite, what &quot;a writer&quot; is.", "publicationDate": "2011-10-14T11:36:41Z", "tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "Poetry", "Culture", "Creative writing"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/14/am-i-a-writer-rick-gekoski", "title": "Am I a writer? | Rick Gekoski", "sentences": ["We went there at least once a year, stopping off on the way home at various enticing spots (Samoa, the Cook Islands, Singapore, Bangkok, Hong Kong) in which I frequently had to fill out one of those immigration forms that asks your occupation."]}, {"article": "What is a league? According to the dictionary it is both &quot;an association of persons, nations etc formed to promote the interests of its members&quot; and &quot;an association of sporting clubs that organises matches between teams of a similar standard&quot;. In football, however, it loosely describes a collection of fiefdoms each pursuing its own ends and to hell with the rest. At least Ian Ayre, the managing director of Liverpool, has not attempted to pretend otherwise in pressing for an end to the idea of the Premier League selling television rights overseas on a collective basis with each club getting a guaranteed share of the proceeds, which at present amount to \u00a31.4bn. Since more viewers in Kuala Lumpur want to watch Liverpool than Bolton, he argues, Anfield should get a bigger cut. This already happens in Spain, where Real Madrid and Barcelona negotiate their own TV fees at home and abroad. &quot;If Real Madrid or Barcelona or other big European clubs have the opportunity to truly realise their international media value potential where does that leave Liverpool and Manchester United?&quot; he asks. &quot;We&apos;ll just share ours because we&apos;ll all be nice to each other ?&quot; More ominously for the Premier League he believes that the future shape of the overall \u00a33.2bn television deal &quot;is a debate that has to happen&quot;. The immediate opposition of Manchester United and Chelsea to Ayre&apos;s proposal and the probability that the likes of Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur will continue to back the present arrangement would appear to have stopped the idea in its tracks but in football, once the seed of a profitable wheeze has been sown, it tends to put down roots, whatever is said at the time. Remember all those plans for a breakaway super league which were being put forward in the 1970s and 1980s? No one took them seriously until the Hillsborough disaster of 1989 begat the Taylor report, which demanded all\u2011seat stadiums and, along with the Sky television contract, virtually guaranteed a breakaway Premier League, with the rump of the old Football League left to pick over the crumbs. If the big clubs ever do succeed in replacing the present equitable TV contract with a free-for-all it will be the result of expediency rather than another tragedy. Uefa has decreed that before long clubs will have to break even if they want to stay in the European tournaments. So either they will need to cut their wage bills or increase their income, with more television money the obvious answer should they decide to go with the latter. And if they are to continue to attract the best talents in order to compete with Barcelona and Real Madrid in the Champions League the former is not a serious option. So the fans in Kuala Lumpur and Beijing or wherever may yet become even more serious players in realising the full &quot;international media value potential&quot; of Liverpool, United, City, Chelsea et al while poor old Bolton scrape by on a few faithful expat Trotters devotees drowning their sorrows in downtown Bangkok. Predictably Ayre&apos;s ideas have upset the game&apos;s middle classes. According to the Wigan chairman, Dave Whelan, &quot;you won&apos;t get more money by killing the heart and soul of the Premier League and killing the heart and soul of football in England&quot;. Whelan is apt to operate on hyperbolic steroids but since one logical conclusion of disturbing the balance of the TV money in favour of the big clubs could hasten the onset of a breakaway plutocratic European league his fears may not be exaggerated. At the very least following the Spanish example in distributing future television income would further polarise a Premier League which has long since confined hopes of glory to a privileged clique with the rest fighting among themselves in order to stay up. There are only a certain number of oligarchs and sheikhs to go round. On the equivalent October weekend of the first season in the Premier League, 1992-93, the top four places in the table were occupied by Norwich, Blackburn, Coventry and Queens Park Rangers. The quality of the football may have been inferior to what it is now and the biggest attendance that weekend was a mere 33,243 at Old Trafford for Manchester United against Liverpool but at least the hopes and fears were more evenly spread. And nobody was much concerned with realising his international media value potential.", "publicationDate": "2011-10-14T13:02:21Z", "tags": ["Premier League", "Liverpool", "Business", "Sports rights", "Football", "Sport", "Media"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/oct/14/liverpool-premier-league-tv-rights", "title": "Liverpool fire starting gun of self-interest in the Premier League | David Lacey", "sentences": ["So the fans in Kuala Lumpur and Beijing or wherever may yet become even more serious players in realising the full &quot;international media value potential&quot; of Liverpool, United, City, Chelsea et al while poor old Bolton scrape by on a few faithful expat Trotters devotees drowning their sorrows in downtown Bangkok."]}, {"article": "I&apos;ve eaten street food all over the world, and some of it was OK. In search of authentic, affordable dining, I&apos;ve grappled with nuclear-sauced doner kebabs in Istanbul and Salford; I&apos;ve sucked on spiced duck bills while squatting on a child&apos;s stool in a Bangkok gutter \u2013 the bill was low; meat pies outside the footy stadium in Adelaide were served as &quot;floaters&quot; in a messy sea of mushy peas; tacos eaten on a roadside in Mexico brought Montezuma&apos;s revenge; khinkali meat dumplings from the old Lenin Square in Tbilisi did the same. So when my mate Paul bragged that the food cart scene in Vancouver was the best in the world and 100% worth the trip, I had a familiar sinking feeling. Paul Done is unofficial mayor of Gastown, the loft-living, macchiato-sipping area that is officially the hippest in central Vancouver. Eating the streets with Paul would be like touring the gentlemen&apos;s clubs of St James&apos;s with Boris, only better for my street cred. To prepare for my day of kerbside cuisine I stayed in the discreet taupe-and-wenge wood embrace of the Granville Island Hotel. Granville Island, a regenerated former industrial area in False Creek, south of downtown Vancouver, dedicates itself to your stomach: there&apos;s a wonderful fresh produce market lined with food stalls, plus any amount of artisan sausage-makers, beardy microbrewers and burly lobstermen. There&apos;s even a boutique sake maker. This being Canada, everyone is super-nice and rather earnest. Morning dawns and here&apos;s Paul, who forces my sake head and my sorry ass on to a push-bike. Vancouver, he explains, is very bike-friendly, with dedicated cycle lanes everywhere \u2013 even if the official mayor has made helmets obligatory. Paul fastens mine on extra-tight, just for laughs. Boris bikes are made in Canada, and sturdy versions are an easy, cheap rent here \u2013 my hotel offers them for free. Cycling Vancouver&apos;s streets, parks and sea wall is a wonderful way to see this most beautiful of cities. With ocean on three sides, snowy mountains beyond, and a mild-ish, London-like climate, Vancouver seems to be inhabited by a race of attractive, big-boned Olympians who make winter sports cool and chilling in hepcat cocktail bars as obligatory as cycle safety measures. It is also home to a huge, established, thriving Asian population, who have had a wonderful effect on the way the city eats, as we&apos;ll see. Until 2009, Vancouver&apos;s only legal street foods were roasted chestnuts, hotdogs and popcorn. Nice, but not lunch. Enlightenment dawned, and a panel was put together comprising two of the city&apos;s leading chefs, a nutritionist, a bloke who runs farmers&apos; markets, a woman who understands fairtrade and sustainability, two local food bloggers and two members of the public, together with a couple of council faces. Together they identified suitable sites for food carts and invited proposals. They came up with a scheme whereby all carts are peer-auditioned, so you never get competing cuisines on neighbouring sites. Also, the authorities regularly inspect all prep kitchens \u2013 so no more sick jokes from me \u2013 and licence-holders have to reaudition every year, which keeps standards high. Paul was right. Vancouver&apos;s street carts are the bomb. First, we breeze along to Japadog (japadog.com), where two nutty Japanese women serve ridiculously delicious fusion hot dogs. I eschew the Love Meat option, and plump for a spicy cheese terimayo: jalapeno and cheese dog, teriyaki sauce, mayo, nori seaweed. Six dollars, epic, genius, and nicely unweird. Vancouver is an expensive city. The Canadian dollar is strong and there has been a hot influx of money from the Far East. Our next cart is great value in any language. Fresh Local Wild (freshlocalwild.com) is run by local celeb chef Josh Wolfe. Josh catches much of what he cooks, and custom-designed his state-of-the-art cart. The kitchen runs on recycled cooking oil; out back there&apos;s a cute veranda with seating. Cart cooking doesn&apos;t get any tastier than this. Paul orders pearly fresh halibut and chips plus homemade tartare sauce C$14 (\u00a39), which I eat most of before tackling my own albacore tuna melt. The cart also has its own smoker, which issues steamed, then woodsmoked and grilled Sausages \u00e0 Trois. What is it with these people?     A pork and beef sandwich from Re-Up    As happened with telecoms, restaurants are becoming more mobile. For some years, the buzz in food has been sustainability. Vancouver shows us that not only should sustainability be a given, but that accessibility is the new thing. What we&apos;re starting to see here is that street food can compete seriously with great restaurant food. Some operators are swanky restaurateurs doing the recession-right thing. Other cart owners are funky idealists simply having fun testing out food concepts, although at around \u00a332,000 (certified prep kitchen and cart) the cost of entry is not low. Vancouver&apos;s carts range from rollalong handcarts through converted ice-cream vans to all-steaming, all-roasting gin palaces like Fresh Local Wild. Paul invites me to waddle back to my bike. A 10-minute puff later and we&apos;re at Cartel Taco (carteltaco.ca), where silk-soft Mexican tortillas are stuffed with Korean bulgogi beef and crunchy kimchi, the garlic and chilli-spiked Korean sauerkraut. I&apos;m stuffed, too, but not so much that I can&apos;t pedal to Re-Up (reupbbq.com) for a round of southern-style pulled pork and beef brisket sandwiches. I let Paul finish them. Just the sort of man I am. On the meandering way down to the mini ferry across False Creek to Granville Island, I sample the chicken karaage and pork slider at Roaming Dragon (roamingdragon.com), bonzai prawns at Feastro, the Rolling Bistro (feastro.ca), and Pepto-Bismol from the Safeway pharmacy. Paul was right. Vancouver&apos;s food carts are exciting and easily as good as any, anywhere.

The prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, appeared on television earlier this month to warn that the situation had reached a &quot;critical level&quot; and that the flooding was the &quot;most serious for decades&quot;. But the worst is certainly yet to come: after devastating 30 of the 76 provinces, claiming 252 lives and causing damage estimated at $3.3bn, water may invade parts of the capital this month. In the northern suburbs, homes, factories and roads are already under water. The prime minister admitted that initial forecasts had fallen short of the most recent estimates, adding that if the water could not be diverted towards the sea the floods would do considerable damage. Despite a sophisticated system of canals, reservoirs and locks, the 7bn cubic metres of water pouring towards the capital from the north can no longer be contained. The governor of Bangkok, Sukhumbhand Paribatra, reported that 90% of the lock gates had been opened, which should allow about 1m cubic metres of water a day to drain into the gulf of Thailand. &quot;But if there is more rain Bangkok will probably be flooded,&quot; he warned. There are always floods during the rainy season, but Bangkok is built on clay subsoil prone to subsidence. It is also under threat from the rising sea level caused by climate change and coastal erosion. Some Thai experts are predicting that part of Bangkok may be waterlogged by 2030. Other less alarmist analysts explain that flooding is a natural phenomenon, given that the city is built on marshy land only a metre and a half above sea level. But with rapid, often chaotic urban development, many buildings have gone up on farmland that used to soak up runoff. Thailand is not the only country affected. In Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, crops have been devastated, schools and hospitals destroyed and tens of thousands of people driven out of their homes. This month the death toll in Cambodia was 172, with 18 dead in Vietnam. Thailand is the world&apos;s largest exporter of rice \u2013 30% of the global market \u2013 and with 1m hectares of rice paddy damaged by floods, its economy is bound to be affected. &quot;The whole region will suffer from the rise in food prices because potential crops have been devastated,&quot; said Margareta Wahlstrom, the UN assistant secretary general for disaster risk.

And what he wanted. Muammar Gaddafi died in his home town holding a silver pistol, killed by some combination of a Nato strike that intercepted his caravan and furious fighters from Misrata who became executioners for an angry country. He said he would not flee as Ben Ali had in Tunisia, but would &quot;live and die&quot; in Libya. The Libyan freedom fighters granted him his wish. Sic semper tyrannis. Gaddafi was the last surviving ruler of the nationalist revolutions of the 50s and 60s, a self-proclaimed revolutionary founder on the model of Nasser rather than Mubarak, Castro rather than Assad. He talked direct democracy and people&apos;s revolution, but governed as an autocrat. He died as he had lived, by the gun. He was as capricious as any autocrat, and so was his demise. For Nato too had intervened with a certain capriciousness, choosing to become the insurgents&apos; air force though its mandate was the protection of civilians, and content to ignore 3,000 unarmed civilian deaths in Syria where intervention had costs; and apparently happy to sustain a Salafist monarchy in Saudi Arabia where the despots have more gravitas, and the oil flows freely \u2013 and where another deposed tyrant, Tunisia&apos;s Ben Ali, lives in the shadows. The gods are laughing: at our hypocrisies and at Gaddafi&apos;s hubris. Five years ago, during the period of reconciliation, Gaddafi had almost begged Hilary Clinton (or Bill) to come to Libya. He much preferred America to neo-colonial Europe and had entrusted his fate to the Americans when he yielded his weapons of mass destruction in 2003 and agreed to pay reparations for Lockerbie. He even joined President Bush in the war on al-Qaida, imprisoning Abdel Hakim Belhaj who had been arrested by the US in Bangkok but rendered to Libya and imprisoned (it was the same Belhaj, freed from prison before the uprising by Saif Gaddafi, who commanded the militia that took Tripoli during the summer). But for giving up his rogue status, he got not Hillary but only Condi Rice and Tony Blair and lesser Americans like Senator Arlen Specter. Yet here now, on the very day before he died, was Hillary Clinton in Tripoli, congratulating not him but the rebels who had deposed him. And it was Clinton who wrote Gaddafi&apos;s epitaph in Tripoli: &quot;Now comes the hard part.&quot; Too true. Gaddafi is gone, but it was enmity to him alone that united the fractious, tribal insurgents. Divided Libya has never before succeeded in forging a unified nation, let alone a democracy. Both Gaddafi and the monarch he overthrew tried, but monarchs and tyrants rarely forge civic unions among the people they abuse. We know from the vicissitudes of the Arab spring elsewhere that revolution and democracy are two different species. The first can be won in a hurry, if at great cost, with the fleeing of a dictator (like Ben Ali in Tunisia) or the arrest of a dictator (like Mubarak in Egypt), or the killing of the tyrant (Gaddafi&apos;s fate). But democracy is another matter altogether, and requires long and patient labour in building civil society, forging a sense of citizenship, broadening education and inculcating habits of tolerance and respect for law that are generally not present in peoples who have lived so long under dictatorship. It is an irony of tyranny that it cultivates bad habits in its victims that can survive the death of tyrants and complicate the journey to freedom. The righteous mob that killed Gaddafi is not a model of justice and the rule of law. Those who think the writing of a constitution and the holding of elections is all it takes to forge democracy \u2013 like so many western heralds of the Arab spring \u2013 have not read history. Those who think revolution and democracy are the same thing have forgotten the lessons of 1789 in Paris and 1917 in Russia and 1979 in Tehran. Revolutions more often breed anarchy, rivalry and in time renewed tyranny \u2013 Napoleon or Stalin or the rule of the mullahs \u2013 than democracy. Even in the United States it took 80 years and a bloody civil war to transform the slave republic into a free republic. Gaddafi is gone, but the hard journey to democracy has scarcely begun. It will require in Libya that 140 tribes be reconciled, that the 300-year-old quarrel of east and west, Cyrenaica and Tripolitania, be put aside. It will mean getting to the bottom of who among the rebels killed their own chief of army staff Abdul Fatah Younis in Benghazi at the end of July; getting the splintering militias to turn over their arms to a national police force; and assuring that victory over the tyrant does not become a blood feud against his clansmen. So sic semper tyrannis is the powerful lesson of Gaddafi&apos;s failed reign and violent death. But &quot;thus always to tyrants&quot; is never the same thing as &quot;life now for democracy&quot;. This is &quot;the hard part&quot; for which a successful revolution is no guarantee, though the people of Libya richly deserve the promised democracy for which they have bravely shed so much of their blood.", "publicationDate": "2011-10-21T16:42:10Z", "tags": ["Muammar Gaddafi", "Libya", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/21/libya-revolution-democracy-muammar-gaddafi", "title": "Libya's revolution has triumphed, but will democracy? | Benjamin Barber", "sentences": ["He even joined President Bush in the war on al-Qaida, imprisoning Abdel Hakim Belhaj who had been arrested by the US in Bangkok but rendered to Libya and imprisoned (it was the same Belhaj, freed from prison before the uprising by Saif Gaddafi, who commanded the militia that took Tripoli during the summer)."]}, {"article": "Inaccurate information, poor management and nature have all combined to unleash one of Thailand&apos;s worst floods in decades. When the newly elected government of prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra took office in early August, it wasted no time in rolling out populist policies catered to its up-country supporters, putting in motion the legacy of Yingluck&apos;s brother, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was deposed in a military coup five years ago and later convicted and exiled for corruption. The jury is out on Yingluck&apos;s leadership and her ability to pull Thailand through the ongoing deluge. Whether and how she bounces back from this flooding crisis will define her premiership. To be sure, floods are not uncommon in Thailand&apos;s low-lying central provinces just north of Bangkok, the country&apos;s traditional &quot;rice bowl&quot;. These provinces have also spawned manufacturing estates for multinational companies in recent decades. Severe floods also beset the central plains and Bangkok in 1983 and 1995, with 1942 the most catastrophic. But the cost of each flood has risen dramatically over the years, as the Thai economy has become more developed. Early rainfall this year, intensified by a string of monsoonal storms, should have prompted early release of waters in the country&apos;s main upstream dams along the Chao Phraya river, the main waterway through the central region descending on Bangkok before it reaches the sea. But the dams did not release enough water to accommodate the monsoons. When the dam gates gushed in earnest, torrential downpours came, thereby submerging adjacent provinces. The damage to farms and factories is likely to cost several billion pounds. The government&apos;s response was initially inept. Different ministers issued different warnings. Inter-agency conflicts and lack of policy co-ordination were rife. Yingluck delegated and skirted around tough decisions. Her strengths of patience and even temperament became her weaknesses. Information was not centralised and reliable. The saturation and sensationalism of television images on a constant news cycle made the public edgier. Yingluck has shifted gear and appears more in charge, having invoked additional laws to give her government more authority short of declaring a state of emergency, which would give the army more powers. The floods also have underlined Thailand&apos;s urban-rural divide which has underpinned a broader national polarisation and conflict since Thaksin&apos;s departure. Downstream provinces were awash in order to divert waters away from central Bangkok. The Thai capital was kept mostly dry at the expense of its surrounding areas. Bangkok&apos;s omnipotence is partly justifiable as it harbours some 40% of GDP as well as being the residence of movers and shakers in Thai society and the yoke of the economy. Yet submerging the rest of the Chao Phraya river basin to secure Bangkok is a mirror image of Thailand&apos;s political crisis pitting the well-heeled urban elites against the hapless downtrodden elsewhere. Moreover, the governor of Bangkok happens to hail from the opposition Democrat party. Unsurprisingly, Governor Sukhumbhand Paribatra&apos;s priorities differ from Yingluck&apos;s. Unless the rains lighten, this trade-off between saving the capital to see its adjacent provinces suffer may prove futile. If Bangkok shares some of the flooding, economic damage will mount but a sense of equality and justice will prevail. When the floods go through the capital, they will find faster release into the Gulf of Thailand. Yingluck&apos;s learning curve will have to steepen quickly. This flooding crisis has enabled her to carve out some autonomy away from her impatient and blustery brother. Managing the floods requires a day-to-day, hands-on operation that precludes the involvement of Thaksin. But the challenge for Yingluck will come during the recovery and rebuilding aftermath. If ways can be found to institute a broad-based, post-crisis stimulus programme, she may not need her brother&apos;s populism as much, and Thai economic growth can still clock a solid expansion with minimal slowdown in spite of global adversity. If her leadership is drowned out by the same floodwaters, her brother&apos;s enemies and opponents will directly become hers.", "publicationDate": "2011-10-21T21:00:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news", "Flooding", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Environment", "Asia Pacific", "Cities"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/21/thailand-floods-bangkok", "title": "The politics behind Thailand's floods | Thitinan Pongsudhirak", "sentences": ["To be sure, floods are not uncommon in Thailand&apos;s low-lying central provinces just north of Bangkok, the country&apos;s traditional &quot;rice bowl&quot;.", "Severe floods also beset the central plains and Bangkok in 1983 and 1995, with 1942 the most catastrophic.", "Early rainfall this year, intensified by a string of monsoonal storms, should have prompted early release of waters in the country&apos;s main upstream dams along the Chao Phraya river, the main waterway through the central region descending on Bangkok before it reaches the sea.", "Downstream provinces were awash in order to divert waters away from central Bangkok.", "Bangkok&apos;s omnipotence is partly justifiable as it harbours some 40% of GDP as well as being the residence of movers and shakers in Thai society and the yoke of the economy.", "Yet submerging the rest of the Chao Phraya river basin to secure Bangkok is a mirror image of Thailand&apos;s political crisis pitting the well-heeled urban elites against the hapless downtrodden elsewhere.", "Moreover, the governor of Bangkok happens to hail from the opposition Democrat party.", "If Bangkok shares some of the flooding, economic damage will mount but a sense of equality and justice will prevail."]}, {"article": "SUNDAY 16 OCTOBER Auckland, New Zealand 20 Australia 6 MONDAY Walk down to the Parnell Baths and up past the posh houses above them.

We&apos;re trying to build walls but there will be some impact on Bangkok,&quot; Yingluck Shinawatra said. Thailand has had its worst floods for half a century after months of unusually heavy rainfall, with 356 people killed since late July and more than 110,000 forced to move to shelters. About 2.5 million people have been affected, with water covering an area the size of Kuwait. The disaster has been a tough start for the prime minister, a political novice elected in a bitter contest this summer. Opponents have accused the government of indecision and mismanagement. Yingluck urged residents to move possessions at least a metre above the ground. In some parts of the city, water levels have already reached double that height. On Saturday she said it could be six weeks before the waters subside. The situation is likely to be complicated by high tides due next weekend. The floods first hit northern and central areas of the country, but torrents of water are now draining south, threatening the capital. Yingluck has already ordered the opening of the city&apos;s floodgates in the hope that it would allow the waters to drain away through urban canals and into the sea. Officials feared that otherwise the defences would be overwhelmed. Critics say the government failed to respond quickly enough to the flooding in the provinces. Many have also complained about vague, confusing or contradictory information, which has left them uncertain about what to do. The government&apos;s supporters have said it is wary of panicking residents. The Chao Phraya river reached its highest level for seven years on Saturday, but justice minister Pracha Promnok, who is heading the flood response team, said people should not worry too much because the overflow had been drained off. He added that water in Klong Prapa, a canal that had been overflowing, was receding, and that water was also draining through other channels as planned. Other reports suggested water levels continued to rise in parts of the canal. Sean Boonpracong, the international spokesman for the flood response team, said food supply centres in or just outside Bangkok, meant to aid other parts of the country, had been hit by rising waters. With residents anxious about supplies, many supermarkets in the capital have sold out of tinned food, instant noodles, bottled water and other essentials. Others began rationing goods. Despite flooding in the Don Muang area, the city&apos;s second airport there has now become an evacuation base and a minister said it would also be used to supply food and water to residents. Elsewhere in Bangkok, troops worked to fortify two key industrial zones, hoping to contain the economic damage wreaked by the disaster. According to the MCOT news site, the Thai chamber of commerce estimates that the floods have already cost the economy 400bn baht (\u00a38bn). That would rise by another 120bn baht a month if business areas were flooded. The governor of the central bank has said growth in south-east Asia&apos;s second largest economy could fall to 3% or less this year, rather than the 4.1% previously forecast. The finance minister has said it could even drop below 2%. Seven industrial estates in Pathum Thani, Nonthaburi and Ayutthaya provinces have already halted production, with Toyota, Honda, Canon and Nikon among the companies affected. At least 600,000 people are unemployed due to the flooding. The labour ministry said that each would receive 2,000 baht. The public health minister said he had ordered hospitals in areas of the city prone to flooding to evacuate critically ill patients to unaffected provinces.", "publicationDate": "2011-10-23T15:16:05Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Flooding", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Environment", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Cities"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/23/bangkok-flood-warning-thailand", "title": "Bangkok braces for more flooding", "sentences": ["Bangkok was preparing for more flooding on Sunday after the Thai prime minister warned that authorities were racing against time to protect the city.", "We&apos;re trying to build walls but there will be some impact on Bangkok,&quot; Yingluck Shinawatra said.", "Sean Boonpracong, the international spokesman for the flood response team, said food supply centres in or just outside Bangkok, meant to aid other parts of the country, had been hit by rising waters.", "Elsewhere in Bangkok, troops worked to fortify two key industrial zones, hoping to contain the economic damage wreaked by the disaster."]}, {"article": "British intelligence believes the capture and rendition of two top Libyan rebel commanders, carried out with the involvement of MI6, strengthened al-Qaida and helped groups attacking British forces in Iraq, secret documents reveal. The papers, discovered in the British ambassador&apos;s abandoned residence in Tripoli, raise new and damaging questions over Britain&apos;s role in the seizure and torture of key opponents of Muammar Gaddafi&apos;s regime. Britain is already facing legal actions over its involvement in the plot to seize Abdul Hakim Belhaj, leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) who is now the military commander in Tripoli, and his deputy, Sami al-Saadi. Both men say they were tortured and jailed after being handed over to Gaddafi. The documents reveal that British intelligence believe the pair&apos;s rendition boosted al-Qaida by removing more moderate elements from the insurgency&apos;s leadership. This allowed extremists to push &quot;a relatively close-knit group&quot; focused on overthrowing Gaddafi into joining the pan-Islamist terror network. One document, headed &quot;UK/Libya eyes only - Secret&quot;, showed the security services had monitored LIFG members since their arrival in Britain following a failed attempt to kill Gaddafi in 1996, and understood their aim was the replacement of his regime with an Islamic state. The briefing paper, prepared by the security service for a four-day MI5 visit in February 2005, said that following the seizure of its two key leaders the year before the group had been cast into a state of disarray. &quot;The extremists are now in the ascendancy,&quot; the paper said, and they were &quot;pushing the group towards a more pan-Islamic agenda inspired by AQ [al-Qaida]&quot;. Their &quot;broadened&quot; goals, it continued, were now also the destabilisation of Arab governments that were not following sharia law and the liberation of Muslim territories occupied by the west. The 58-page document, which included names, photographs and detailed biographies of a dozen alleged LIFG members in the UK, went on to highlight &quot;conclusions of concern&quot; in the light of these changes. These included the sending of money and false documents to a contact in Iran to help smuggle fighters into Iraq, where British and US forces were coming under fierce attack. &quot;UK members have long enjoyed a reputation as the best suppliers of false documents in the worldwide extremist community,&quot; said the report. It added that British LIFG members were becoming &quot;increasingly ambitious&quot; at fundraising through fast-food restaurants, fraud, property and car dealing, and raised nearly all the money for the group outside of Libya.British security also asked Gaddafi&apos;s security forces for access to detainees and their debriefs. Asked about the document, a Foreign Office spokesman said: &quot;It is the government&apos;s longstanding policy not to comment on intelligence matters.&quot; The LIFG eventually merged with al-Qaida in 2007. However, a second document, a secret update on Libyan extremist networks in the UK from August 2008, says the response of British members was &quot;subdued and mixed&quot;. It concluded that those already supporting the wider aims of al-Qaida continued to do so, but &quot;those with reservations retain their focus on Libya&quot;. It added, however, that some money raised by members in Manchester may have gone to &quot;assist operational activity&quot;. The cache of confidential documents - which included private letters to Gaddafi from Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and key Downing Street aides - was abandoned when the three-story residence was attacked by Gaddafi loyalists in April. . There was also a dossier prepared by British intelligence with suggested questions for the captured men. The 39-page document, entitled Briefs for Detainees and labelled &quot;UK Secret&quot; on each page, was written in three sections in March, June and October 2004. The first section is dated the month of Belhaj&apos;s arrest, and sought answers on everything from his private life to his military training, activities in Afghanistan and links to al-Qaida. There were also personalised questions for Saadi. The LIFG, founded by veterans of the mujahideen&apos;s war against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, was for many years the most serious internal threat to Gaddafi, coming close to blowing up the dictator with a car bomb in his home town of Sirte in 1996. The government denied claims by David Shayler, the renegade British spy, that this assassination attempt was funded by British intelligence. After Gaddafi&apos;s clampdown on the group, dozens of dissidents were allowed to settle in Britain. London only designated the LIFG a terrorist organisation after Libya said it was abandoning its weapons of mass destruction programme in 2003. The move is understood to have been agreed as part of the negotiations with Gaddafi&apos;s regime that paved the way to the controversial Blair deal. Belhaj, now a key figure in liberated Libya, is preparing to sue Britain after other documents discovered in the wake of Gaddafi&apos;s fall indicated that MI6 assisted in his rendition to torture and brutal treatment from the CIA and Gaddafi&apos;s regime. MI6 informed the CIA of his whereabouts after his associates told British diplomats in Malaysia he wanted to claim asylum in Britain. He was allowed to board a flight to London, then abducted when his aircraft landed at Bangkok. Belhaj claims he was suspended from a ceiling and tortured at Bangkok airport before spending six years in solitary confinement at Tripoli&apos;s notorious Abu Selim jail.

The government declared a five-day holiday in Bangkok and affected provinces, and the education ministry ordered schools to close until 7 November. Financial institutions will remain open. Heavy rainfall in the capital added to the trepidation of residents, and further rain is forecast for Wednesday. The flood response headquarters is itself under threat. Thailand is used to floods in monsoon season, but this year&apos;s are the worst for more than half a century. They have killed at least 366 people since July and affected almost 2.5 million. More than 113,000 are living in shelters. While most of the capital has yet to be affected by flooding, there is growing concern in Bangkok. Residents have complained about confusing information from officials, who have offered unclear, overly detailed or apparently contradictory messages at times. &quot;In terms of the big picture, we have not explained that well,&quot; said Sean Boonpracong, international spokesman for the relief effort. In her latest televised address, prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra urged residents to move their belongings to higher levels and prepare for flooding. She said waters should reach a maximum of half a metre in central districts if defences held, but could triple that level if they broke. Seri Supharatid, director of Rangsit University&apos;s Centre on Climate Change and Disaster, told Reuters: &quot;In the worst-case scenario, if all the dykes [along the Chao Phraya river] break, all parts of Bangkok would be more or less flooded.&quot; Provinces north of Bangkok have borne the brunt of the flooding until now. But late on Monday, the flood relief headquarters said water levels in those areas were stable or decreasing, while the run-off was heading towards the capital. Water levels in the Chao Phraya are already at a record high, and Bangkok governor Suhumbhand Paribatra said they could rise to 2.6m above sea level. The flood defences along the river are 2.5m high. Authorities last week opened the city&apos;s floodgates in the hope much of the excess water would drain through the city&apos;s canals, taking pressure off its defensive walls but increasing the risk to central areas. Commercial flights to Bangkok&apos;s second airport, Don Muang, stopped on Tuesday as waters inundated the area. Boonpracong said the flood response headquarters itself might have to move because it is based at the airport. Officials expect flood waters to engulf much of the airport on Friday, but say their maximum height should be one metre. Four thousand people who have been sleeping in a terminal have already been told they must be evacuated again, this time to the eastern province of Chon Buri, due to overcrowding. &quot;I thought it would be safe and well-protected,&quot; said Somboon Klinchanhom, a 43-year-old civil servant who took refuge there last week, as she packed her belongings again.

Is is the contention that while rich, industrialised nations caused climate change through past carbon emissions, it is the developing world that is bearing the brunt. It follows from that, developing nations say, that the rich nations must therefore pay to enable the developing nations to both develop cleanly and adapt to the impacts of global warming. The point is starkly illustrated in a new map of climate vulnerability (above): the rich global north has low vulnerability, the poor global south has high vulnerability. The map is produced by risk analysts Maplecroft by combining measures of the risk of climate change impacts, such as storms, floods, and droughts, with the social and financial ability of both communities and governments to cope. The top three most vulnerable nations reflect all these factors: Haiti, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe. But it is not until you go all the way down 103 on the list, out of 193 nations, that you encounter the first major developed nation: Greece. The first 102 nations are all developing ones. Italy is next, at 124, and like Greece ranks relatively highly due to the risk of drought. The UK is at 178 and the country on Earth least vulnerable to climate change, according to Maplecroft, is Iceland. &quot;Large areas of north America and northern Europe are not so exposed to actual climate risk, and are very well placed to deal with it,&quot; explains Charlie Beldon, principal analyst at Maplecroft.  The vulnerability index has been calculated down to a resolution of 25km2 and Beldon says at this scale the vulnerability of the developing world&apos;s fast growing cities becomes clear. &quot;A lot of big cities have developed in exposed areas such as flood plains, such as in south east Asia, and in developing economies they so don&apos;t have the capacity to adapt.&quot;     Fast growing cities are at particularly high risk from the impacts of global warming Photograph: Maplecroft    Of the world&apos;s 20 fastest growing cities, six are classified as &apos;extreme risk&apos; by Maplecroft, including Calcutta in India, Manila in the Philippines, Jakarta in Indonesia and Dhaka and Chittagong in Bangladesh. Addis Ababa in Ethiopia also features. A further 10 are rated as &apos;high risk&apos; including Guangdong, Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Karachi and Lagos. &quot;Cities such as Manila, Jakarta and Calcutta are vital centres of economic growth in key emerging markets, but heat waves, flooding, water shortages and increasingly severe and frequent storm events may well increase as climate changes takes hold,&quot; says Beldon. With the world on the verge of a population of seven billion people, the rapid urbanisation of many developing countries remains one of the major demographic trends, but piles on risk because of the higher pressure on resources, such as water, and city infrastructure, like roads and hospitals. Helen Hodge, head of maps and indices at Maplecroft, says it is not only local populations at risk from climate change impacts, serious though that is. The breaking of international supply chains for businesses working in a globalised world is also a big risk, she says. &quot;The recent flooding in Bangkok shows how very large multinationals can have long supply chains put at risk,&quot; she says, noting that Thailand is the world&apos;s largest producer of hard-disk computer drives. China, the world&apos;s workshop, sits almost exactly halfway in the vulnerability index at 98 out of 193. That&apos;s appropriate, as China now sits awkwardly between the nations getting rich on carbon emissions and those suffering from its effects. And that&apos;s the other major contention that will underpin the UN climate talks in Durban.", "publicationDate": "2011-10-26T13:45:00Z", "tags": ["Environment", "Climate change", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Global development"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/oct/26/climate-change-developing-country-impacts-risk", "title": "Map shows stark divide between who caused climate change and who's being hit | Damian Carrington", "sentences": ["&quot;The recent flooding in Bangkok shows how very large multinationals can have long supply chains put at risk,&quot; she says, noting that Thailand is the world&apos;s largest producer of hard-disk computer drives."]}, {"article": "     Thousands are fleeing Bangkok after the city&apos;s governor ordered residents of three districts to evacuate and breaches in dykes allowed floods to spread through the capital. The central government has declared a five-day holiday from Thursday, encouraging many to leave the city. A naval official warned that Bangkok&apos;s main river is likely to overflow its defences on Saturday, when high tides are expected to merge with the heavy runoff from further north. The floods are the country&apos;s worst for more than half a century and have claimed 373 lives. Unusually heavy rains have killed hundreds more in neighbouring Cambodia and Burma. &quot;We&apos;re at a critical moment, we need to monitor the situation closely from 28 to 31 October, when many areas might be critical \u2026 massive water is coming,&quot; said Bangkok&apos;s governor, Sukhumbhand Paribatra. The UK Foreign Office urged Britons to avoid all but essential travel to the Thai capital and other flood-affected areas. China urged its nationals to leave the area. The director general of the Thai navy&apos;s hydrographic department said the Chao Phraya river&apos;s water level \u2013 already at a record height \u2013 is expected to peak at 2.65 metres (9ft) after 6pm on Saturday, the Bangkok Post reported. Defences are 2.5 metres high. Vice Admiral Nirut Hongprasit said the peak should last no more than 30 minutes, the newspaper said. Thousands of people packed Bangkok&apos;s Mo Chit bus terminal and large crowds arrived at Suvarnabhumi airport. Bangkok&apos;s second airport, Don Muang, has closed to commercial flights owing to flooding. Some roads out of the city had reached gridlock, with many better-off residents heading for seaside resorts such as Pattaya and Hua Hin. In the Sai Mai district of Bangkok, residents clamoured to board evacuation trucks. &quot;We haven&apos;t been able to get on one [military truck] yet, we have been waiting for almost an hour,&quot; said 71-year-old Saman Somsuk. &quot;There aren&apos;t many trucks.&quot; Others escaped using paddle boats, plastic tubs, inner tubes and rubber rafts. On one flooded road, several men were floating on a plank buoyed up by empty barrels. Around 50,000 soldiers were on standby to help evacuate residents, the defence spokesman told the Bangkok Post, with around 1,000 boats and 1,000 trucks. Colonel Thantathip Sawangsaeng said more than 100 schools would be opened as evacuation centres taking up to 10,000 people from affected districts. Yingluck Shinawatra, who was elected prime minister two months ago, told reporters the crisis had reached a critical point. &quot;It seems like we&apos;re fighting against the forces of nature, massive floodwater that is causing damage to several of our dykes,&quot; she said. &quot;The truth is, we need to let it flow naturally out to the sea, and what we can do now is to manage it, so that it flows slowly, otherwise everybody will suffer.&quot; Reporters asked if she was crying as her voice began to tremble during the briefing. &quot;No, I haven&apos;t cried and I won&apos;t. I&apos;ll be strong to solve this problem for the Thai people. Right now we need to release floodwater to the sea as soon as possible and we need a quick rehabilitation plan,&quot; she said. Workers rushed to tackle breaches in flood barriers today, while residents in other districts built cement walls and stacked sandbags to protect homes and businesses. One woman carried a bag of life jackets as she travelled on the Skytrain. Other parts of the region have suffered owing to heavy rains. In Burma, at least 147 people died in a flash flood in Pakokku in the central Magway region last week. In one township, 2,200 homes were reportedly swept away. In Cambodia, the most severe floods for a decade have left 250,000 people homeless, with water levels receding only very slightly since heavy rains ended. The National Committee for Damage Management said earlier this month that the disaster had caused $100m (\u00a362m) in damages. Kim Rattana, executive director of the charity Caritas, told the Phnom Penh Post that flooding had killed 247 people and affected more than one million others across 17 of the country&apos;s 24 provinces. &quot;We are seeing disease outbreaks in increasing numbers,&quot; warned John Macgregor of the Cambodian War Amputees Rehabilitation Society, which has been aiding victims in Battampang province in the north-west. &quot;I would say 80% of the children we have been dealing with have [diarrhoeal diseases].

Right now we need to release floodwater to the sea as soon as possible and we need a quick rehabilitation plan.&quot; The floods, caused in part by unusually heavy monsoon rain, have already killed 373 people in Thailand and disrupted the lives of nearly 2.5 million, until now mostly in the north and central provinces. The rains have also killed dozens in neighbouring Cambodia and Burma. By Thursday night, floodwaters had overwhelmed seven of Bangkok&apos;s 50 districts, mostly on the northern outskirts. Roads became rivers, and homes and businesses were swamped. Relief agencies believe most if not all of the city could be flooded with waters rising between 20cm and 2 metres in the coming days. High tides this weekend are likely to place more pressure on the city&apos;s limited flood defences and could swell the Chao Phraya river to overflow flood barriers lining its banks. In the meantime, many people are remaining in their homes. &quot;The mayor of Bangkok has said that of the 140 evacuation centres that have been set up only a quarter are being used and none are full,&quot; Matt Cochrane, spokesman for the International Federation of the Red Cross in Bangkok, told the Guardian. &quot;It is all about waiting and what is coming. This is the beginning of the potential humanitarian crisis for Bangkok. There is going to be water in most or all of the city. It won&apos;t be a tsunami, it is more likely to be a gradual rise.&quot; Yingluck has warned the flood waters could stay for as long as a month. The Red Cross believes this will threaten a particular type of urban crisis in which public transport grinds to a halt, there are breaks in electricity leaving the city sweltering in 35C heat and 100% humidity, and the risks of mosquito-borne disease multiply. And there are other dangers lurking in the waters. &quot;When my father leaves to get food he makes sure he closes all the gates and doors \u2013 not to prevent intruders but to keep out the crocodiles,&quot; said Nara Rathnarathon, a resident in the north of the city. Thailand is reckoned to be the world&apos;s biggest breeder of crocodiles and scores are reported to have escaped from farms during the floods. Several have been killed or captured in residential areas in the ancient capital of Ayutthaya. Cochrane said parents had been told to keep children out of any gardens that remained dry because they could be safe havens for venomous snakes. The economic impact is already being felt. At least seven huge industrial estates have already shut to the north of Bangkok, causing the central bank to revise down its growth forecast the economy from 4% to 3.1%. Websites have posted instructions on the proper way to stack sandbags and residents have fortified homes with bricks, gypsum board and plastic sheets. Walls of sandbags or cinder blocks cover building entrances. There has been panic buying in supermarkets, where bottled water is scarce, but many of the city&apos;s thousands of restaurants, bars and food stalls are operating as usual. Nuntaporn Khorcharoen, whose home is next to the heavily inundated Bang Phlat district, told the Associated Press her family had stocked up and was staying put. &quot;My father is adamant we have to stay to oversee the situation,&quot; the 30-year-old said. &quot;He said even without electricity we will still have something to live on.&quot; The defence ministry said 50,000 armed forces personnel were standing by with 1,000 boats and 1,000 vehicles to help evacuate people. &quot;We&apos;re considering whether we should order an evacuation of Tawee Wattana district as the flood situation there is worrying,&quot; said Bangkok&apos;s governor, Sukhumbhand Paribatra, after more water surged into Tawee Wattana canal. Plenty of true grit in the city of sandbags Bangkok is a city of sandbags where instant noodles are like gold dust and bottled water like vintage wine. Amid the panic-induced bare shelves there is bewilderment in the air: what exactly is going to happen to Thailand&apos;s capital? All along downtown Asoke Road, locals have been fortifying their shopfronts, some opting to build little cement walls as a last line of defence against floodwater that is gushing into the city and disturbing people on the outskirts and near the mighty Chao Phraya river. Bangkok&apos;s 10 million residents have been expecting the worst for a while \u2013 waiting for 4bn cubic metres of rain water to start draining through the city from the north \u2013 but on Thursday many of the streets remained bone dry. Advice from the authorities has ranged from &quot;get out now!&quot; to &quot;don&apos;t panic!&quot; and some of the wealthier residents have already packed up to clog the roads and take impromptu vacations south, to beach resorts such as Hua Hin, while others remain behind, ready to face the elements. &quot;My family was too chilled about preparing for the flooding, which is probably a pretty bad thing,&quot; said Aim Monobelle, 25, who is staying with friends while her family sticks it out in western Bangkok. &quot;I would say most older people don&apos;t want to leave their houses, thinking it&apos;s not going be too bad. I am trying to convince them to move \u2013 anywhere but Bangkok \u2013 because it&apos;s risky, but they are not listening to me.&quot; For people 50 miles north of Bangkok, in Ayutthaya province, there was little else to be done but watch as the roads turned into rivers and water inundated their homes. People now get around by long-tail boat or leaky creations fashioned out of old oil drums, tyre inner tubes or large tubs. Some 2.5 million people have been affected by the flooding in Thailand, including 800,000 children, many of whom are lacking basic necessities such as nappies and food. Getting aid to those people has proved a challenge. Plan, a global child-rights organisation, travelled by truck, boat and fire engine on Saturday to deliver 900 relief kits to families in Bang Pa-in, Ayutthaya, but many more are still in need. Not everyone is fleeing. &quot;I&apos;m not going to desert the city in its time of need. I&apos;m staying right here,&quot; Richard Barrow, a Thailand-based blogger, proclaimed on Twitter.

A crazy thing happened on 12 April 2006: England beat India in India. In the 2026 days since then, their record in all forms of the game is P15 W0 D1 T1 L13. Few would expect them to improve that today. It&apos;s a different form of the game, and England are the best side in the world according to the new ICC rankings*, but one format tends to bleed into other, particularly when you have just been thrashed 5-0. There&apos;s a whiff of the inevitable, and we haven&apos;t even had the toss.  * Though they will drop to third if they lose today, with India jumping from fifth to second and Sri Lanka going top  The pitch is the same one that was used during Tuesday&apos;s special collapse, which means another trial by spin for England. Permission to take up residence behind the sofa? Permission granted. Rumours that India have recalled Bishan Bedi, Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, Rajesh Chauhan and Arshad Ayub in a team of 11 spinners are unconfirmed.  India have won the toss and will bat first. The England captain Graeme Swann says he would have batted as well, and you would expect the pitch to turn increasingly as the match progresses. England have two chances in this match, and Slim really needed to bat first. An England victory would be gloriously illogical. India Uthappa, Rahane, Kohli, Raina, Y Pathan, Dhoni (c/wk), Jadeja, Tiwary, Ashwin, V Kumar, P Kumar. England Hales, Kieswetter (wk), Pietersen, Bopara, Bairstow, Buttler, Patel, Bresnan, Swann (c), Finn, Dernbach.  This is England&apos;s last match of what has been a momentous year. A gold star for the person who can tell us when they last had no international matches in November and December.  An email from Mike Selvey at Eden Gardens &quot;I can tell you that Samit parked himself down next to me at lunch (half a chicken wrap, no salad for him, I promise you) and told me he was batting at four. We shall see but personally I think he has played the spin as well as anyone. Anyway he says he is not going to die wondering today. No surprise that KP makes the cut. This is the equivalent of Asprey&apos;s shop window for him and he wasn&apos;t going to miss it.&quot; He&apos;s had a decent tour, hasn&apos;t he? I feel a bit sorry for him having to come in at No7 all the time. It&apos;s no place for an orthodox batsman, but he has done okay there. In fact he has only twice come in higher than No7, and one of those was when he belted 70 not out last week.  &quot;They did not play in October and November of 2001 (and only started again at the end of December),&quot; says Ian Copestake, &quot;so I am hitching my inadequately researched star to 2001.&quot; Nup, the Test series against India started in December. Look at that England team!  WICKET! India 1-1 (Rahane c Kieswetter b Finn 0) After all sorts of faffing, the game finally gets underway, and Steve Finn strikes with the fourth ball! Rahane edged a drive at a very full delivery, and Kieswetter dived to his right to take a magnificent one-handed catch.  1st over: India 5-1 (Uthappa 1, Kohli 4) Kohli pings a lovely boundary through midwicket. Lord Selvey suggests 1988 as the last year in which England had November and December off. In fact it was 1993, ahead of the West Indies tour. Which for some reason always reminds me of Beth Jordache and Margaret kissing in Brookside. I think it&apos;s because Brookside happened to be on in the background while I was listening to one of the Tests on a Friday night; Trinidad maybe, Haynes b Salisbury 38, you know the one.  WICKET! India 5-2 (Uthappa c Kieswetter b Bresnan 1) What&apos;s going on here then? England have struck twice in the first eight deliveries. Uthappa fenced at a shortish delivery from Bresnan and edged it to the right of Kieswetter, who took a smart diving catch. It wasn&apos;t a blinder like the first, but it was still a very decent take.  2nd over: India 5-2 (Kohli 4, Raina 0) Raina feels outside off stump for his first ball and pings it just short of point, and then he checks his second ball not far short of the bowler Bresnan. &quot;After another blinder by Kieswetter, it might be a good idea for him to forget that he has two hands,&quot; says Anand. &quot;He seems to do his best work with one hand.&quot;  3rd over: India 12-2 (Kohli 5, Raina 6) This is a vital partnership of course, with both men in exceptional form at the moment. Raina shows that by driving Finn for a magnificent straight six. What a way to get off the mark! &quot;By far the strangest aspect of that scorecard is the fact that in India&apos;s first innings Mark Butcher took the first wicket,&quot; says Tom King. &quot;After 9.1 overs. Whagwan?!&quot; First change ahead of Flintoff and White? Blimey. I assume it was swinging, and Nasser had a hunch.  4th over: India 21-2 (Kohli 14, Raina 6) Kohli swats Bresnan extravagantly over mid on for four, a marvellous stroke, and then helps a short ball on its way to the fine-leg boundary. This is a wonderfully confident and assertive response from Kohli and Raina. &quot;1993 eh,&quot; says Mike Selvey. &quot;That must mean I had two months off and didn&apos;t even know it.&quot;  5th over: India 26-2 (Kohli 17, Raina 10) Jade Dernbach comes on to replace Steve Finn. He could do with a decent game after a chastening ODI series. After a decent start to the over, Raina cuts a filthy delivery for four. &quot;The inclusion of Buttler makes this a potential On the Buses tribute side,&quot; says Ian Copestake, &quot;to be bolstered further by picking a Blakey, an Olive and a Chalky.&quot; Picking a Blakey is India is not to be advised.  WICKET! India 26-3 (Kohli c Hales b Bresnan 15) A fantastic running catch from Alex Hales gets rid of the dangerous Virat Kohli. He hoicked a slower ball from Bresnan high towards cow corner, and Hales charged round the boundary before holding on just a fraction inside the rope.  6th over: India 32-3 (Raina 15, Tiwary 1) Raina smears Bresnan back over his head for four. He is in a brutal mood. &quot;Great link to the 2001 Test team \u2013 love it,&quot; says Jon Devaney. &quot;To be fair that&apos;s a pretty good top six, few complaints. And as bowling attacks go? Well, at least there was Hoggy. How we got the, out for only 469 I can only fathom...&quot; That was the start, really, of the 2005 attack. Flintoff and to a lesser extent Hoggard came of age as Test bowlers, Giles put daylight between him and other spinners like Robert Croft (who, like Andy Caddick, pulled in the aftermath 9/11) and then Harmison and Jones made their debuts the following summer.  7th over: India 38-3 (Raina 16, Tiwary 5) With the Powerplay over, Samit Patel can come into the attack. Tiwary premeditates a lap sweep for two in a obundaryless, six-run over. &quot;Put a link in to Dick Blakey&apos;s autobiography then,&quot; says Mike Selvey. As sports books go, it does have one of the better titles: Taking It From Behind.  8th over: India 54-3 (Raina 31, Tiwary 6) The captain Graeme Swann replaces Bresnan, and his first over disappears for 16! Raina cuts the first ball for four and then slog sweeps a huge six. He is in fantastic nick and has moved to 31 from 21 balls.  9th over: India 61-3 (Raina 31, Tiwary 13) Tiwary works Patel for three consecutive twos and then edges an attempted sweep over Kieswetter for a single.  10th over: India 65-3 (Raina 33, Tiwary 15) Graeme Swann replaces Graeme Swann with Jade Dernbach, who bowls a good over at a cost of only four singles.  WICKET! India 66-4 (Tiwary b Patel 15) Tiwary slogs across the line of a quicker delivery from Patel that hits the off stump. Well bowled Samit, although that wicket might be a mixed blessing for England: here comes MS Dhoni.  11th over: India 66-4 (Raina 34, Dhoni 0) A superb over from Patel brings a wicket and a solitary run.  WICKET! India 74-5 (Raina c Bairstow b Finn 39) This is a big wicket for England. Finn returns to the attack, probably with one eye on Dhoni, but he picks up Raina instead. It was a short, wide slower ball, and Raina slapped a cut straight to point.  WICKET! India 74-6 (Jadeja b Finn 0) Two in two balls for Finn. Jadeja tried to cut a ball that was too close for the shot, and dragged it back onto the stumps.  12th over: India 74-6 (Dhoni 3, Y Pathan 0) &quot;Dhoni has not only proved himself to be an excellent limited-overs batter, but also a startlingly effective laxative,&quot; says Phil Sawyer. &quot;Every time he walks to the wicket when England are bowling he makes my stomach go watery. God knows how he makes the England bowlers feel but I wouldn&apos;t be surprised to see their habit of mysterious disappearances to the dressing room increase even further.&quot;  13th over: India 81-6 (Dhoni 5, Y Pathan 5) England have a huge shout for caught behind against Dhoni turned down. Dhoni pushed at a ball from Swann that looped up in the air off the pad and was taken by Kieswetter down the leg side. England were certain there had been an inside edge; replays suggested they were probably right. Yusuf Pathan gets four to fine leg later in the over.  14th over: India 83-6 (Dhoni 6, Y Pathan 6) Dhoni survives Finn&apos;s hat-trick ball, but there are just two singles from the over. Finn ends with outstanding figures of 4-0-22-3. It&apos;ll be fascinating to see if he jumps the queue to the Test team in the new year, because he is starting to look like a serious bowler. &quot;Never mind &apos;On The Buses&apos;,&quot; says James Wrout. &quot;Some of us of a certain age can&apos;t wait to see Buttler and Anderson teaming up again. It would be music to my hearing aid.&quot;  15th over: India 87-6 (Dhoni 7, Y Pathan 9) A diabolical piece of umpiring from S Ravi reprieves Pathan when he pushes around a very straight delivery from the new bowler Ravi Bopara. Hawkeye suggests it would have hit leg stump. Still, another very good over for England. Pietersen had a right go at the umpire at the end of the over, which isn&apos;t really on, no matter how bad the decision was. &quot;Just realised that Suresh Raina is the Michael Bevan of the 21st century!&quot; says Anand. I know what you mean \u2013 brilliant in ODIs, poor at Test cricket because of a struggle against the short ball \u2013 although they are different types of batsmen. Bevan, as Christian Ryan said, had a &quot;tweezer for a bat&quot;, whereas Suresh Raina has a sledgehammer for a bat.  16th over: India 91-6 (Dhoni 10, Y Pathan 10) Dhoni&apos;s too quiet. Far too quiet. There are only four runs from Bresnan&apos;s final over. He ends with superb figures of 4-1-19-2, and Dhoni has 10 from 19 balls. England are probably on top, although even 110 could be a tricky target against all those spinners. &quot;Is there a T20 change to the lbw law I don&apos;t know about?&quot; says Mike Selvey. It really was a hideous decision.  WICKET! India 91-7 (Y Pathan b Bopara 10) Superb bowling from Ravi Bopara. Yusuf Pathan is beaten by consecutive slower balls and then cleaned up emphatically by a quicker one that sends his off stump flying.  WICKET! India 91-8 (P Kumar b Bopara 0) Bopara is bowling beautifully here, and bowls Boom Boom Kumar second ball with a fine inswinger that knocks the middle stump over.  17th over: India 91-8 (Dhoni 10, Ashwin 0) A double-wicket maiden for Bopara, whose figures are 2-1-4-2. A double-wicket maiden in Twenty20! &quot;So when was the last time England fielded three wicketkeepers, all of whom took catches?&quot; asks John Starbuck. Hales isn&apos;t a keeper, is he? As for fielding three keepers, Trescothick, Stewart and Crawley (who all kept wicket in international cricket) were in the same Test team in Australia in 2002-03. No idea if Trescothick and Crawley took catches, though.  18th over: India 95-8 (Dhoni 12, Ashwin 2) Dhoni comes through for a suicidal single and is miles short of his ground when the throw from backward point misses the stumps. That&apos;s one of four singles in Dernbach&apos;s over, and now it must be time for Dhoni to open his shoulders.  19th over: India 107-8 (Dhoni 13, Ashwin 12) The penultimate over of the innings, from Bopara, costs 12. Ashwin drives a lovely boundary through extra cover, the first for 33 balls, and chips another over mid off later in the over.  WICKET! 20th over: India 120-8 (Dhoni run out 21; Ashwin 17 not out) The final over goes for 13 and includes \u2013 do not adjust your set \u2013 the wicket of MS Dhoni. First Ashwin drags Dernbach for four, and then Dhoni gets a reprieve. He swiped a slower ball miles in the air, and it dropped through the hands of Bairstow, running round from mid-on. In fact he hardly got hands on it. It was a costly miss, because Dhoni whirled an astonishing bottom-handed six down the ground next ball. He was then run out off the last delivery by the bowler Dernbach. So England need 121 to win and stay at the top of the T20 rankings. It could be a deceptively tricky target. See you in 10 minutes.  1st over: England 8-0 (target 121; Hales 1, Kieswetter 6) The offspinner R Ashwin opens the bowling, and starts with a beautiful doosra that beats Alex Hales. Craig Kieswetter survives a big LBW shout later in the over after missing a slog sweep \u2013 there was a doubt over height \u2013 and then makes room to drive expertly over cover for four. An eventful first over. &quot;Your wish is my Saturday afternoon with not much else to do, Rob,&quot; says Phil Sawyer. &quot;Catches from Messrs Tresco, Crawley and Stewart in the first innings of this match. Also in the fifth Test. Not many catches from any England fielders in the matches in between, mind.&quot;  2nd over: England 14-0 (target 121; Hales 5, Kieswetter 8) It&apos;ll be offspin from both ends, with Yusuf Pathan to share the new ball. Has there even been  a boy born who can swim faster than a shark  a Twenty20 innings in which only spinners have bowled? India could do that here if they wished. Pathan&apos;s first over isn&apos;t the best, a touch too straight, and England are able to milk ones and twos into the leg side. I wouldn&apos;t give Pathan a second over if I were MS Dhoni. I wish I were MS Dhoni.  3rd over: England 20-0 (target 121; Hales 6, Kieswetter 12) The dangerous Kieswetter pulls a terrible delivery from Ashwin round the corner for four. It&apos;s a fine over apart from that, with just two more runs from it.  WICKET! England 21-1 (Kieswetter c Tiwary b Jadeja 12) Here we go. Kieswetter advances to the new bowler Jadeja and drives him in the air to long off, where Tiwary takes a cool catch. That was a bit of a naive shot from Kieswetter, although I suppose we can&apos;t have it both ways.  4th over: England 22-1 (target 121; Hales 8, Pietersen 0) Pietersen has a big drive at his first ball and is beaten by a beauty that turns sharply. This is going to be very difficult for England. &quot;By bowling the spinners first up, has Dhoni made sure England are more focused?&quot; says Anand. &quot;I thought the strategy was to give some runs to England against the seamers, make them feel everything is all right and then bring in the spinners.&quot;  5th over: England 26-1 (target 121; Hales 10, Pietersen 2) Pietersen tries to drive Ashwin and screws it luckily over the leg side. It&apos;s all a bit too manic for England&apos;s comfort \u2013\u00a0and now Pietersen has been dropped! He top-edged a slog sweep over the head of short third man. Three fielders converged, and eventually Raina got himself in a poor position before dropping it. He should have taken that. &quot;Right, you have one wish,&quot; says Mike Selvey. &quot;You can be either Rob Key, Martin McCague or MS Dhoni. Which is it to be?&quot; Mike Selvey. Actually, Rob Key is very good in the Sky studio; he should do more of it. Between innings he said that &quot;if Finn bowls like this in England, he is going to be unplayable.&quot; I got quite excited when he said that.  6th over: England 28-1 (target 121; Hales 10, Pietersen 2) This is filthy cricket from England. They are all over the place on an admittedly tricky pitch. Hales misses a premeditated reverse sweep, and then Pietersen survives a huge shout for LBW after missing a sweep. It looked extremely close, although I suppose it might have been missing leg. Hawkeye suggests it was indeed missing leg. Pietersen has two from nine balls; Jadeja has figures of 2-0-2-1. &quot;Another question which some OBO reader may be able to answer: has anyone seen the Ladyboys of Bangkok&apos;s act?&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;My wife is going tonight with a bevy of her old school friends and I&apos;d like to know what state I can expect them back in.&quot;  WICKET! England 40-2 (Hales c Rahane b Y Pathan 11) Yusuf Pathan returns in place of R Ashwin (3-0-7-1). Pietersen Dilscoops his first boundary straight over the keeper&apos;s head, and then switch-hits a monstrous six over extra cover/midwicket. Pick that out. It was shaping up to be a brilliant over for England, but then Hales fell to the last delivery. He lifted Pathan towards deep midwicket, where Rahane charged in from the boundary to take a superb two-handed catch diving forward.  7th over: England 40-2 (target 121; Pietersen 13, Patel 0) Samit Patel does come in at No4, as Selve said he would.  8th over: England 45-2 (target 121; Pietersen 14, Patel 2) A wonderful diving stop from Raina saves four when Patel slaps Jadeja through the off side. Patel then survives an optimistic pair of shouts for caught behind and LBW. Great stuff from Jadeja, though: his figures are 3-1-7-1. &quot;Having been used to abysmal fielding by India through the 90s while our batsmen&apos;s catches were plucked out of thin air by the likes of Mark Waugh, that last catch by Rahane felt good,&quot; says Anand. &quot;I said a &apos;wow&apos; to myself.&quot;  9th over: England 61-2 (target 121; Pietersen 25, Patel 7) Samit Patel clatters Pathan down the ground for four, an excellent stroke. Then Pietersen takes 10 from two balls, a sweet lofted stroke over deep midwicket for six followed by a vicious smear to the same area. Pietersen started abysmally and is now playing majestically.  10th over: England 74-2 (target 121; Pietersen 32, Patel 9) Praveen Kumar bowls the first over of seam in this innings. Pietersen slams a majestic pull over midwicket for four and then sweeps four more through square leg. Thirteen from the over and 29 from the last two. Pietersen is playing sensationally; he has 36 from 21 balls.  11th over: England 80-2 (target 121; Pietersen 36, Patel 15) Vinay Kumar also comes on to bowl, and Samit Patel dumps his second ball lazily over long on for six. What a shot! Those are the only runs from the over, mind, and Patel would have been run out from a direct hit off the last ball of the over when Pietersen sent him back.  12th over: England 82-2 (target 121; Pietersen 37, Patel 16) India need a wicket from Jadeja in his last over. England sense this, and are content enough with a couple of low-risk singles. Jadeja ends with brilliant figures of 4-1-9-1. England need 39 from 48 balls and will have to work very, very hard to bugger this up.  13th over: England 95-2 (target 121; Pietersen 48, Patel 18) Pietersen hammers Vinay Kumar through extra cover for four and then belabours a slower bouncer over deep midwicket for his third six! Wonderful stuff. England are cruising.  14th over: England 98-2 (target 121; Pietersen 49, Patel 20) R Ashwin&apos;s last over is surely India&apos;s last chance. Pietersen survives a huge LBW shout after missing a reverse lap. That looked plumb, and replays confirm that Pietersen was lucky. Three singles from the over, and Ashwin is done for the day.  WICKET! England 100-3 (Patel c Tiwary b Kohli 21) A soft end to a decent supporting innings from Patel, who slices the new bowler Kohli high in the air towards cover. He takes a comfortable catch, his second of the innings.  15th over: England 102-3 (target 121; Pietersen 52, Bopara 0) Earlier in the over Pietersen drove Kohli down the ground to reach fifty from only 34 balls. He was manic for the first 10 balls; since then he has been majestic.  WICKET! England 106-4 (Pietersen LBW b Raina 53) Pietersen gets a shocking decision from the umpire. He missed a switch hit at Raina, bowling around the wicket, and was given out LBW. The ball pitched miles outside leg stump. Ah well, it happens. Pietersen played a brilliant and probably matchwinning innings of 53 from 39 balls.  16th over: England 106-4 (target 121; Bopara 2, Bairstow 0) England need 15 from 24 balls. They couldn&apos;t, surely. &quot;Did the umpire think KP was batting left handed?&quot; says Anand.  17th over: England 113-4 (target 121; Bopara 8, Bairstow 0) Bopara pulls Kohli meatily for four to calm any burgeoning nerves. The target is down to 8 from 18 balls.  18th over: England 118-4 (target 121; Bopara 13, Bairstow 1) Bopara survives a big shout for LBW from Raina, with the ball straightening from around the wicket. That was out. The umpires haven&apos;t had a great day.  18.4 overs: England 121-4 (Bopara 15, Bairstow 2). ENGLAND WIN BY SIX WICKETS WITH EIGHT BALLS TO SPARE Ravi Bopara steers Virat Kohli for a single to complete a superb victory for England, who stay No1 in the world as a result. It&apos;s also their first win against India in India since 2006. Kevin Pietersen struck a fantastic 53, while Steve Finn and Ravi Bopara bowled beautifully. Graeme Swann also had a good day, as captain if not with the ball, and England have ended a miserable little tour on a high.

Like the majority of the capital&apos;s residents, she is staying put despite evacuation orders following Thailand&apos;s worst floods in half a century and the waters continuing to rise. &quot;We&apos;ll stay one more night,&quot; she said. &quot;Well, unless it gets really high.&quot; Bangkok faces a growing emergency. Flood defences were breached on Saturday in the Thonburi district, bringing water to the outskirts of the central tourist and business areas. The mighty Chao Phraya river, which wends through the city, is predicted to break its banks over the weekend when coastal tides swell its volume, threatening to inundate central areas. The government has mobilised more than 50,000 soldiers, 1,000 trucks and 1,000 boats for the relief operation. Army trucks carrying residents through the water pass sandbag barriers stacked like shooting ranges. Along the roadside, entrepreneurs sell everything from wellington boots and lifejackets to blocks of foam and inflatable dinghies. Wandee is proud of the community spirit in the district. &quot;We rely on each other, not the government,&quot; she said. In a number of northern districts of the capital, the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority has ordered evacuations. The city&apos;s governor, Sukhumbhand Paribatra, said this weekend was &quot;a critical moment&quot;, and that &quot;massive water is coming&quot;. Prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra said she was only &quot;50% confident that the inner zone of Bangkok will not be completely flooded&quot;. The government has announced a five-day holiday to enable citizens to escape and emergency relief centres have been set up around the country. With all domestic flights booked up, public transport packed and the roads hectic, it is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people have already left. There are risks for those who stay. The Red Cross warns that the city faces a &quot;potential humanitarian crisis&quot; of water and mosquito-borne illnesses, and many shops have run out of essentials like bottled water, eggs and instant noodles. Danger also lurks in the water. As well as snakes and rats, there are scores of crocodiles which have escaped from flooded crocodile farms. Nipapat, a market worker from the north of the city, told how she saw a crocodile attack a small child playing in the water. &quot;The men in the neighbourhood hunted it down and killed it,&quot; she said. The floods have had a devastating impact on the country. More than 380 people have been killed and a third of Thailand&apos;s provinces have suffered serious flooding, affecting 2.2 million people. The sheer scale of the problem is laid out in a popular flood-awareness cartoon, which explains that the volume of water, which has to drain from the north to the Gulf of Thailand, is equivalent to the weight of 50m blue whales. The cost of the floods is already estimated at 800bn baht (\u00a316bn) and is likely to rise further. The city of Chonburi, one hour south of Bangkok, has set up a relief centre in a sports centre to take some of the evacuees from the capital. The gym floor is a colourful patchwork of red mats, dome tents and sprawling bodies. Downstairs hordes of volunteers bustle about, handing out basic supplies, giving financial advice and even organising local trips to lift people&apos;s spirits. For Luangjan, this is the second emergency centre she has been to \u2013 the first one was flooded a few days ago. She left Rangsit, north of Bangkok, last week with 10 family members. &quot;The dam broke,&quot; she said. &quot;The water was too fast and too strong to save anything.&quot; They ferried their family to dry ground in a giant plastic tub, before being picked up by one of the many army trucks criss-crossing the disaster zones. She is worried about what will happen when they return \u2013 her hairdressing business has been flooded and she is sceptical about whether the government will provide any assistance. &quot;When the floods stop they will only care about [big] business \u2013 not people like me,&quot; she said. In Bangkok, taxi driver Bprasert was also sceptical about how the government can handle the crisis. He repeated a common criticism that there has been too much political conflict between Bangkok&apos;s governor and the prime minister, who both represent different political parties. &quot;One says yes, the other no,&quot; he said. &quot;They should work together, but they don&apos;t.&quot; Bprasert slept in his taxi on Friday night, parked on the raised express way along with hundreds of other cars left on higher ground by their owners. His district in the south of the city was unaffected yesterday but he was worried that the flood would come soon.

Degano wanted to see how this might affect the milk that later issued from the cows. Degano, based at the Istituto Sperimentale Lattiero Caseario in Milan, published the results of this feed-flakes-to-cows experiment in 1993, in the journal Tecnica Molitoria. Degano called the study Cereal Flakes in Milk Cows Diet. Effects on Yield and Milk Quality. He reported that yes, mixing plenty of maize-and-barley flakes into the cows&apos; usual, unflaked maize-and-barley fodder did result in different milk. Slightly different. Those cows gave about 2% more milk (by volume), with about 2% richer protein content and about 2% greater creaminess. All this as compared with the milk-making of 21 cows that munched only the usual mealy mush. Degano&apos;s monograph seems to have attracted little attention, at least in print, from other dairy scientists. And it garnered just about no acclaim from the general public in Italy or abroad. Scientists have, as a group, shown more interest in cereal&apos;s crispness, especially as it interacts with liquid, than in how the flakes interact with cows or with human innards. The most famous report, A Study of the Effects of Water Content on the Compaction Behaviour of Breakfast Cereal Flakes, was published in 1994, in the journal Powder Technology. Three scientists at the Institute of Food Research in Norwich wrote it. In 2001, a student named Kunchalee Luechapattanapom, at the Asian Institute of Technology in Bangkok, Thailand, submitted a master&apos;s thesis called Acoustic Testing for Evaluating the Crispness of Breakfast Cereals. Others, too, tried their hand at the flake analysis game, generally using either the Norwich or the Bangkok approach. But Lawrence Edward Bodkin, Sr, an inventor in Jacksonville, Florida, may have circumvented the traditional worries about milk and breakfast cereal flakes, by combining the two elements into one. In 1998, Bodkin patented a foodstuff he calls Breakfast Cereal with Milk Pieces. Bodkin&apos;s odd patent describes a &quot;commingling and packaging of milk nuggets with cereal pieces ... The milk pieces may be compact, or flattened and flake shaped and may generally be as variable as the shapes of the cereal&quot;. Any strangeness in the milk&apos;s flavour, he writes, &quot;is unlikely to be noticed due to the typically more dominant flavors of the cereal&quot;.

John Macgregor, an aid worker who has been accompanying teams delivering food and water to Battambang, described the area as a vast inland sea where conditions are dire and malnutrition is common. &quot;Diseases are becoming more common and yesterday our doctors diagnosed the first cases of cholera. People are sleeping in extended family groups on rush mats which sit on the mud, under strips of clear plastic. Ducks, chickens, dogs and cats are often in there with people - a factor in the mounting disease toll,&quot; said Macgregor, communications director of Cambodian War Amputees Rehabilitation Society (CWARS) from Phom Penh, the Cambodian capital. CWARS delivered food to 6,000 people and its medical teams treated 1,600 patients in seven days. &quot;We drove for six hours \u2013 the roads are wrecked from rain \u2013 then waded through floodwater for half an hour, then got a boat for about an hour,&quot; Macgregor said. &quot;Much of northern Cambodia has become a vast inland sea \u2013 an astonishing sight. We travelled by boat for an hour at a time between bits of dry land.&quot; Like other countries in the region, Cambodia has been hit by heavy monsoon rains that have overwhelmed swollen rivers, dams and canals, causing the worst flooding in decades. It is estimated that 250,000 people in the three worst-affected provinces are inundated and without aid. According to the UN, more than 20 provinces in Thailand \u2013 one third of the country \u2013 are under water. Twelve provinces are on high alert, including Bangkok, and around 2.4 million people have been affected countrywide; 700,000 are estimated to be children. In Cambodia, 17 out of 23 provinces continue to be flooded while 250,000 people have been affected in Vietnam. Half a million people have been affected in Laos, with damage to more than 64,000 hectares (158,000 acres) of farmland, while 254,400 people in the Philippines have felt the brunt of a series of typhoons. Many flood victims have been children. In Vietnam&apos;s Mekong delta, 49 of the 57 deaths since August have been children, according to the national flood and storms control department. In Cambodia, at least 80 children have died, while more than 50 have been killed in Thailand, all mostly from drowning, according to the UN. In Battambang, Macgregor saw a canoe carrying three children overturn. &quot;They started to drown. The villagers, who couldn&apos;t swim, threw them some of our empty water containers and they were saved,&quot; he said. Children have made up around a quarter of the nearly 800 deaths reported since July across Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and the Philippines, according to the UN. Every year, an estimated 240,000 children aged up to 17 die mostly because they have never learned to swim. That annual number is roughly equal to the total deaths from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, but day-to-day water deaths attract little attention. The floods have also taken a heavy economic toll: in addition to the damage to Thailand&apos;s rice crop, the market is concerned about typhoons hitting production in the Philippines, the world&apos;s biggest importer until last year, and seasonal floods in Vietnam&apos;s Mekong delta.", "publicationDate": "2011-11-01T08:40:48Z", "tags": ["Global development", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "World news", "Cambodia", "Asia Pacific", "Vietnam", "Laos", "Philippines", "Thailand"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/nov/01/cambodia-floods-disease-toll", "title": "Cambodia floods bring mounting disease toll", "sentences": ["Twelve provinces are on high alert, including Bangkok, and around 2.4 million people have been affected countrywide; 700,000 are estimated to be children."]}, {"article": "Every journalist secretly yearns to shout aloud as deadline looms: &quot;Hold the front page!&quot; It was nearly so with this edition of the Weekly, as a decision by the Greek government, announced on Monday evening after our finance pages were done and dusted, to stage a referendum on what was thought to be the definitive eurozone bailout plan demanded that we undertake a radical revamp.

The verdict brings a dramatic end to one of New York&apos;s most high-profile trials in recent years. It also put a stop to the career of the world&apos;s most notorious arms dealer who prosecutors argued has provided weapons that have fuelled bloody conflicts around the world. Bout, 44, had denied any wrongdoing in the case, which alleged he had been willing to sell a vast amount of lethal weapons and ammunitions to the Colombian rebel group the Farc, which he knew could be used to &quot;kill Americans&quot; who were helping the Colombian government. The shipment was to have included surface-to-air missiles, 20,000 machines guns, grenades, mortars, high explosives and 10m rounds of ammunition. Bout had argued that he was merely a businessman who happened to run an air freight operation in conflict zones. Bout was caught in an elaborate sting operation by the US Drug Enforcement Agency, whose informants posed as weapons buyers for the Farc. He was arrested in Thailand where he had believed he was to be meeting the buyers, and was then extradited to the United States. Anti arms-trade campaigners enthusiastically welcomed the news of the guilty verdict. &quot;The verdict in the Viktor Bout trial closes the book on one of the most prolific enablers of war, mass atrocities and terrorism in the post-Cold War era. We should all be grateful that the world is safer now that the man who armed the hotspots of the globe is behind bars,&quot; said Kathi Lynn Austin, executive director of the Conflict Awareness Project and former United Nations investigator, who had followed the trial. Some experts used the verdict to call for a tightening of international controls on the arms trade, saying Bout&apos;s career had long flouted huge loopholes which allowed the easy spread of weaponry into the world&apos;s conflicts. &quot;It is tragic that because we have no global treaty regulating the activities of arms dealers, many other unscrupulous dealers and brokers will continue to operate \u2026 we can&apos;t rely on well-paid informants to catch all rogue traders. The answer is better global regulations,&quot; said Oistein Thorsen, an arms tradecampaigner at Oxfam International. Lawyers for Bout had offered what prosecutors called the &quot;planes defence&quot; where they claimed that their client had no intention of selling any weapons but acted like he had so he could sell two old cargo aircraft for $5m. But prosecutors had poked holes in the defence with the use of secretly recorded conversations in Bangkok between Bout and the informants he believed were acting for the Farc. On one tape an informant said that he wanted to kill Americans in Colombia. &quot;Kill them, and kick them out of my country,&quot; the informant said on the tape. &quot;They don&apos;t care where they go any more. &quot;They go here, they go there. They go wherever they want. Why?&quot; Bout was quoted as replying: &quot;Yes, yes, yes. They act as if \u2026 as if it was their home.&quot; The informant then testified that during the same conversation, Bout wrote down a list of weapons he could provide on a sheet of paper and told him: &quot;And we have the same enemy.&quot; Asked what that meant, the informant responded: &quot;He was referring to the Americans.&quot;  Bout&apos;s case was also hit by the testimony of his business associate, South African Andrew Smulian, who took the stand against him as part of a plea deal.  Smullian, 70, was accused of the same crimes as Bout. He pleaded guilty to all counts and agreed to testify against his former associate, hoping to reduce his own prison sentence, a minimum of 25 years. Smulian said that Bout had said that for a downpayment of $20m he could air-drop 100 tonnes of weapons into Colombia. It was Smulian who had initially approached Bout in Moscow about setting up the deal with the Farc. Bout now faces the possibility of life in prison at a sentencing hearing in February. He hugged one of his legal team as he left the court room. Defence lawyer Kenneth Kaplan expressed disappointment at the verdict. &quot;It was a tough case,&quot; he said afterwards. But Manhattan attorney general Preet Bharara welcomed the court decision. &quot;Viktor Bout was ready to sell a weapons arsenal that would be the envy of some small countries. He aimed to sell those weapons to terrorists for the purpose of killing Americans. With today&apos;s swift verdict, justice has been done and a very dangerous man is behind bars,&quot; Bharara said in a statement. Bout&apos;s personal history is shrouded in mystery, as is much of the detail of his career, as he spent several decades criss-crossing the world and doing business in some of the globe&apos;s deadliest war zones. He is believed to have sold arms to a dizzying array of countries and rebel movements often playing both sides of the same war. Bout&apos;s dealings have included the US, the Taliban, the Northern Alliance and various groupings in Africa from Congo to Sierra Leone. His career became so notorious that the Yuri Orlov character played by Nicholas Cage in the 2005 film Lord of War is believed to have been partly based on Bout.", "publicationDate": "2011-11-02T21:10:56Z", "tags": ["Viktor Bout", "Arms trade", "Russia", "US foreign policy"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/02/viktor-bout-arms-trade", "title": "Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout found guilty of selling weapons to Farc rebels", "sentences": ["But prosecutors had poked holes in the defence with the use of secretly recorded conversations in Bangkok between Bout and the informants he believed were acting for the Farc."]}, {"article": "Russia has lashed out at the United States for its conviction of the arms dealer Viktor Bout and said it would work to bring home the notorious &quot;merchant of death&quot;. Bout faces between 25 years and life in prison after being found guilty on Wednesday of four counts of conspiracy to sell weapons to purported Colombian rebels with the aim of killing US citizens. &quot;Our goal is to achieve his return to the motherland,&quot; the foreign ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said in a statement. Lukashevich accused US authorities of illegally extraditing Bout from Thailand following his arrest during a US sting operation in Bangkok in 2008 and of &quot;purposefully creating a negative environment that prevented the objective consideration of facts&quot; during the trial. He said that Bout, a Russian citizen, had been held in &quot;unnecessarily harsh conditions&quot;. &quot;All this calls into question the very foundation on which the charge was built and, accordingly, the validity of the judicial decision,&quot; he said. Russia had loudly objected to Bout&apos;s arrest and fought hard in a Thai court to prevent his extradition and subsequent trial in New York. Bout built his reputation as a &quot;merchant of death&quot; by conquering the global arms trade in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union, one of the world&apos;s most heavily armed entities. His relations with the Russian government remain a mystery and he has denied serving as a Soviet army officer in Mozambique in the 1980s at the same time that Igor Sechin, a deputy prime minister and close ally of Vladimir Putin, was also serving there. Bout pleaded not guilty and did not testify in the trial. Bout&apos;s wife, Alla, told Russian state-run television that when she visited her husband in prison last week, she told him: &quot;You know, no matter what happens, don&apos;t give up, because this is not the end of the story.&quot; The conviction comes as the US and Russia struggle to keep their &quot;reset&quot; in relations afloat. Russia reacted angrily last month to a US state department decision to ban Russian officials linked to the death in prison of the lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, drawing up its own list of banned US officials in response. In the US, the reset has all but fallen off the agenda as the president, Barack Obama, focuses on the economy before the presidential election while US Republicans dub the policy a &quot;disaster&quot;. Bout&apos;s conviction has been widely denounced inside Russia. Leonid Slutsky, deputy head of the Duma&apos;s international affairs committee, told Interfax news agency it was a &quot;typical American agitation&quot;. &quot;Out of Bout they made a kind of evil genius villain, carrying out some sort of evil that got its start in Russia,&quot; he said.

The Scot, who recently moved past Roger Federer to No3 in the world, could hardly be lining up the world No1 at a better time. And the ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena in Greenwich, south-east London, is a place where Murray feels most comfortable: indoors on a hard court. Tomas Berdych, who beat Murray in a tough quarter-final of the BNP Paribas Masters in Paris last week, is in the same round-robin group, along with the hard-to-beat Spaniard David Ferrer \u2013 Murray&apos;s opponent in his first match on Monday. Murray said: &quot;There are obviously no easy matches as it&apos;s only the top eight players in the world playing. That&apos;s what is so unique about this tournament. You have to be on top of your game from the very first match. I&apos;ve been happy with my form. I&apos;ve got some great memories from my run to the semi-finals last year; hopefully I can go even further this time round.&quot; Sifting through these draws is always an exercise in clutching at straws, given the quality of tennis at the highest level, but Murray, Ferrer and Berdych will be happy to catch Djokovic at his most vulnerable. The Serb quit in the second set of the final of the Cincinnati Masters against Murray and even struggled en\u00a0route to winning the US\u00a0Open against Rafael Nadal in September. He pulled out after two rounds in Paris last week with what he described as an inflamed right shoulder, but which has been troubling him more than he likes to admit for three months. He faces Berdych first up on Monday evening. Group\u00a0B has Nadal, whose uncharacteristic quietness must have his peers on edge, Federer (on a run of fine form after a rest and back to a smooth peak after winning in Paris), Jo\u2011Wilfried Tsonga and the American Mardy Fish, who limped out of his past two tournaments injured and must be considered doubtful \u2013 the rising Serb Janko Tipsarevic is standing by. Fish is scheduled to face Nadal on Sunday evening. Tsonga, who will play Federer on Sunday afternoon, said: &quot;Obviously it couldn&apos;t be an easy draw but it&apos;s a very good group for me. I&apos;ll be playing against Roger once again. I&apos;ll play Rafa on a surface that suits me really well and I&apos;ll be expecting to beat Mardy Fish. Having played there three years ago will help me, because I won&apos;t be looking around telling myself: &apos;Oh, it&apos;s great to be here.&apos; I&apos;m not going there just to participate.&quot; Three titles on the spin in Asia and 18 consecutive match wins gave Murray hope of winning in Paris too, until Berdych beat him in a three-hour classic. The upside of that is it somewhat relieved the pressure on the Scot coming to London. So, the parameters have shifted again. A year ago at this tournament, Federer and Nadal were favourites; the Swiss beat the Spaniard in the final and all seemed as it should be. However, Nadal, then No1, went into the final after the most electric semi-final against Murray, probably the best three-set match of the year. The subsequent power shifts have lent tennis the uncertainty it needed after years of the Federer-Nadal duopoly; now Murray finds himself in the mix again, and he is playing his best since that semi-final against Nadal. The Scot has won five tour titles in 2011 \u2013 Queen&apos;s, Cincinnati, Bangkok, Tokyo and Shanghai.

There&apos;s a nice scene in Paris with Greg, her estranged fianc\u00e9, when she asks him to let her go, because he can&apos;t really compete with Kilimanjaro. Colette Another example of the not-so-subtle ways of this show: a French stewardess who&apos;s also a mistress called Colette. Colette is excited to bump into an amour from Rome on a flight, until it turns out that he&apos;s married with a child, and his wife has something to say about her sleeping with him. The second episode seems to be setting up a romance with Captain Dean, though he&apos;s still pining after Bridget, which is fine, but it would be nice to see the one who&apos;s implied to be less chaste actually being unchaste, if only for a while. These girls all appear to be very well-behaved in the bedroom, so far, at least. No sexual revolution here yet. Bridget Bridget only exists in flashbacks in the pilot, where we eventually learn that she was a CIA agent, and Kate is replacing her. Her beautiful English ways have charmed Captain Dean into proposing, but she&apos;s suddenly MIA \u2013 we learn later that she&apos;s suffering the dual humiliation of being deactivated and sent to live in Missouri. In Paris, she warns Kate that she can escape, if she likes. But this is escape for her. And that means she will be a very good spy. The men The pilots aren&apos;t what this show is about. They&apos;re prone to saying sexist things that they don&apos;t realise are sexist (Ted) or doing a bit of blue-eyed pining over beautiful stewardesses (Dean). This show also seems at pains to point out that they&apos;re a bit inadequate compared to the women, because they aren&apos;t trilingual, and pull funny faces when they are faced with another language. It looks like Dean will get over Bridget and under Colette; will lothario Ted get together with Maggie, now she&apos;s made an effort to show him the error of his ways? Notes and observations \u2022 In the pilot particularly, the music is incessant. And if there are any more songs about flying or travel from the 60s, expect to hear them. Perhaps we could have big-band covers of Fly by Nicki Minaj? On A Plain by Nirvana (plane. Oh never mind)? \u2022 Where are all the cigarettes? Wasn&apos;t flying in the 60s supposed to be a smoky haven? \u2022 There&apos;s a strong emphasis on how educated these stewardesses are. They all have a degree and seem to speak three languages. But they also have to stop work when they&apos;re married, or reach 32, or rip their tights, or put on a pound too many. Sexism! \u2022 The rousing empowerment speeches are clunky: &quot;This is your life, what do you wanna do?&quot; &quot;I wanna see the world!&quot; &quot;People have underestimated me before. They&apos;ve been wrong.&quot; &quot;I rode an elephant in Bangkok last week!&quot; But I couldn&apos;t help getting carried along with it all. Yes, they serve coffee, but they get to ride elephants! In Bangkok! \u2022 After tonight, the show moves to Saturday evenings, with a double-bill from 9pm.

He said that such a change would help increase the sale of merchandise. Given that antelope don&apos;t make up much of the Rockingham Road club&apos;s fanbase that was possibly correct, though it raised the question of why he didn&apos;t try fully to exploit the climate of the day and retag the club as the Boyzone. It wasn&apos;t the first time a club had attempted to exploit a nickname change for commercial gain. A few years earlier Stockport County had looked into ditching their traditional sobriquet, the Hatters, in favour of the Cobras as a commercial tie-in with the Indian lager company. As time wears on, and sports&apos; craving for cash grows ever more junkie-like, I&apos;d guess we can expect more of this kind of thing. Mike Ashley&apos;s sale of the naming rights to St James&apos; Park was predictably followed by legions of self-styled &quot;realistic&quot; football folk dismissing tradition as sentiment, while parroting phrases like &quot;revenue streams&quot; with all the blind faith and incomprehension of medieval Rhenish peasants calling out Latin responses to the Eucharist. Yet, if football is genuinely so eager to chisel every last penny from itself it needs to look even further back than Stockport&apos;s brief flirtation with becoming a load of cobras. It was when I was still at school this pointer to the future occurred, though at the time it seemed like a piece of throwaway sporting trivia, the sort of thing you&apos;d carry around with you no matter how hard your tried to get rid of it, like psoriasis, or the disturbing memory of Steve Ovett&apos;s &quot;I &apos;heart&apos; you&quot; victory gesture. Back in March 1980 \u2013 in a move that in the next decade may come to look as significant as the Bosman judgment \u2013 Nick Akers, a distance runner who had arrived in the Cayman Islands via Sussex, New Zealand and Canada, legally changed his surname to Vladivar to tie up a deal with a UK drinks company. Vladivar promoted itself as &quot;The Vodka from Varrington&quot;. Now, in the midst of the cold war, a runner bearing its brand name was going to compete in the Moscow Olympics. Since the rules of amateurism were still in force the distillers didn&apos;t actually pay Nick Vladivar any money for changing his family name. &quot;They flew me to Manchester from Edmonton, Canada,&quot; he told me this week, &quot;and paid all of my expenses while we did the press and photo ops \u2013 \u00a310,000 was pledged to Joel Bonn, the secretary general of the Cayman Islands Olympic Committee, for sponsorship of the Cayman athletes to participate in Moscow, but as the Olympics were boycotted, I am not sure if a payment was made.&quot; Nick Vladivar was arguably the first sportsman to sell naming rights to himself, but he wasn&apos;t the last. In Thailand it has become relatively routine for boxers to take on the name of sponsors. As a result there is a flyweight called Kwanpichit 13 Rien Express (in honour of a Bangkok restaurant), while an unbeaten southpaw super-flyweight has been variously known as Samson Toyota-Thailand, Samson 3-K Battery and Samson Dutch Boy Gym according to who was stumping up the cash at the time. This is a strange state of affairs, though since Samson&apos;s given name is Saengmuangnoi Lukchapormasak it may be some relief to boxing commentators. Football clubs have only one stadium name to sell, but they have a whole squad of players whose appellations are ripe for commercial exploitation. And why not? After all, people in the rarefied world of showjumping are quite happy to put up with horses named after conservatory companies. And haven&apos;t the game&apos;s authorities already left themselves open to sponsorship-deal abuse by allowing players to put nicknames on the back of their shirts? The first player who was given dispensation to do so was Norway&apos;s diminutive 1990s winger Jahn Ivar Jakobsen who went by the sobriquet of &quot;Mini&quot; and had that name emblazoned on his shirt during the 1994 World Cup. At the time some of us pondered what Fifa&apos;s attitude would be if a player could persuade his team-mates to refer to him as &quot;Amex&quot; or &quot;Miller Lite&quot;. The sale of the naming rights of players is surely the way to take the game forward commercially. Of course people will complain at first, but you have to be hard-nosed about these things. And at the end of the day, Stevie G or KFC \u2013 what&apos;s the difference? Just get behind the boy and stop whining. Nick Akers, meanwhile, ran in two Commonwealth Games and still holds the Cayman Islands national record for 10,000m. In 1989 he set a Guinness world record for running a mile in snowshoes in 5m 56sec. He wrote an autobiography, Last But Not Least, and has developed the concept for a stage musical based on the music of Simon and Garfunkel. &quot;Would I change my name again?&quot; Nick says. &quot;You bet I would. But next time it would be to Smirnoff.&quot; Over to you Mike Ashley.

She never left. In her early days as a Peace Corps volunteer, she set up a centre for street children and established the first children&apos;s radio programme to be broadcast in the neglected national languages. Despite the fact that French is the official language in Senegal, it is only understood by 1-2% of women. After years of observing development and education programmes falter due to poor communication with local communities, Melching set up Tostan, a foundation dedicated to community-led education and sustainable development. Tostan means &quot;breakthrough&quot; in the west African language of Wolof and over the last 20 years, it has engaged more than 220,000 people, in 22 local languages across eight African countries. Melching&apos;s ability to immerse herself in a community and earn the respect of its members has enabled her to encourage dialogue about female genital cutting (FGC), a practice with a long history in West Africa. Tostan&apos;s approach is not to confront but to work with shared moral norms and present communities with the facts. As a result of Tostan&apos;s work, 6,236 villages across West Africa have publicly abandoned FGC. The government has now woven Melching&apos;s model into a National Action Plan to end FGC in Senegal by 2015. Kelvin Mwikya      Kelvin Mwikya spent his nights as a young adult on the floor of Industrial Area Remand Prison in Nairobi. Within a space designed to house 800, 3,000 inmates lay packed against one another. Denied the most basic necessities, the prisoners were quick to realise the value of a stack of donated bibles, from which torn out pages could be used as toilet paper. In this way, Mwikya came across a torn page, which told the story of a master encouraged to receive his errant slave back as a brother. The story defied the devastating stigma and isolation that prisoners and ex-offenders faced. This was Mwikya&apos;s first introduction to restorative justice. On leaving prison in 2002, he founded the Philemon Foundation which began to address the basic hygiene and nutrition needs of inmates, while offering practical support as ex-offenders tried to reintegrate back into society. Through vocational training and the establishment of halfway houses, the reoffending rates plummeted among those involved in the programme. His model of support has been so successful that the government has asked Mwikya to help roll it out across Kenya&apos;s 97 prisons as part of a nationwide penal reform. He is working closely with the government but has refused their offer to expunge his record, realising that it is his status as an ex-offender that gains the trust of prisoners and proves to the communities that a positive future is possible for Kenya&apos;s 50,000 convicts. Sameena Nazir      A Pakistani-American who focuses on Islam and women&apos;s empowerment, Sameena Nazir stands at the modern crossroads of the human rights movement. Her journeys between the two countries brought home the increasing restrictions and challenges facing women in Pakistan, particularly in the marginalised rural regions and those areas affected by recurrent natural disasters. In 2003 she founded the Potohar Organisation for Development Advocacy in the Punjab region, which provided creative training and skills development to girls who were unable to continue into high school education. Handicrafts produced through the workshops are sold though an online store that brings fair trade goods to a global market. This generates much-needed funding and promotes the role that the women play in the economy of their communities. The training also offers a simple, unconfrontational space to discuss issues of rights and protection with other women. In rural areas, Nazir has built strong relationships with and between women farmers, advocating for their inclusion in local and national agricultural departments up and down the country. Through the strength of these networks, PODA was well placed to support those hit by the 2005 earthquake and the 2010 floods that displaced so many and left thousands of women widowed or as the sole carer of their children. Armed with this experience, Nazir has spent time lobbying ministerial offices and played a key role in the development of the Charter for the Rights of Women in Disaster Situation. Renwick Rose      Despite his 40 years of work in civil society development and trade justice, Renwick Rose is not a globally recognised name. Yet, among the small farming communities of the Windward Islands in the Caribbean, he is a celebrated figurehead affectionately known as the &quot;Banana Man&quot;. In the 1990s, Rose spotted the value and necessity of organisation and cooperation at a time when the banana trade was entering a downwards spiral. He earned the trust of small-scale farmers who were struggling to make it onto the supermarket shelves and guided them through the process of Fair Trade Certification. The establishment of the Windward Island National Farmers&apos; Network Association (WINFA) has generated security and progress which radiates out into the wider community. Through their partnership with Fair Trade, the WINFA farmers earn a premium of a dollar for each box of bananas, which is invested democratically back into the community. In this way, the social, educational and trade infrastructure of the islands has begun to bloom. Rose&apos;s attempt at retirement in 2010 was thwarted by the devastating impact of the hurricane that destroyed farms across St Lucia and St Vincent. He returned immediately to lead the farming community on the uphill slope towards recovery, and, with his support, Windward Island bananas were back on the supermarket shelves within eight months. Mechai Viravaidya      Mechai Viravaidya was born to a Scottish mother and a Thai father \u2013 a background which has given him an interesting perspective on Thailand&apos;s struggle with HIV. The taboo around any discussion of sexual health or family planning has long hindered progress in tackling the spread of HIV or population growth. However, it was into this highly conservative public sphere that Viravaidya launched a national awareness programme so effective and so driven by his unique sense of humour and public policy that it has earned him the title of Thailand&apos;s &quot;Condom King&quot;. His organisation, the Population and Community Development Association, set up in 1974, drew a firm line between poverty alleviation and reproductive rights; today it is one of Thailand&apos;s largest NGOs. But it is the personal quirks of Viravaidya&apos;s approach that have caught the imagination of the public. The launch of his restaurant - called Cabbages and Condoms - gave him both a means of sustainable income and a relaxed space in which to trigger debate around family planning. In a city-wide project billed as Cops and Rubbers, Viravaidya mobilised the Bangkok police force into distributing condoms to the public. But beyond the puns, these initiatives have contributed to an 80% drop in new cases of HIV between 1991 and 1994 and a major reduction in the average birth rate. Now in his 70s, Viravaidya is expanding his focus to rural educational reform in the hope of creating a new generation of honest, empowered leaders.", "publicationDate": "2011-11-18T08:55:27Z", "tags": ["International development achievement award 2011"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/achievementsaward/shortlisted-nominess-2011", "title": "International Development Achievement award shortlist 2011", "sentences": ["In a city-wide project billed as Cops and Rubbers, Viravaidya mobilised the Bangkok police force into distributing condoms to the public."]}, {"article": "Escapism The Sri Lankan government is pouring money into Kalpitiya, to turn this coastal area in the Puttalam district into a tourist destination.

He&apos;s a 24-year-old factory worker left with no home and no job after the worst floods to hit Thailand for more than 50 years. &quot;The factory announced a three-day holiday when the floods hit,&quot; he said. &quot;But since then we&apos;ve heard nothing.&quot; He has been living in an emergency evacuation centre for over a month now, after fleeing from his family home in northern Bangkok when a canal burst its banks. &quot;The current was so strong I couldn&apos;t stand up properly,&quot; he said. They didn&apos;t have enough time to rescue any belongings, and the house is now submerged up to the ceiling. Twenty members of his family and close neighbours are camping in the gym, along with hundreds of other evacuees from the capital. They are some of the estimated 9 million people affected by the severe flooding that has caused serious damage across south-east Asia. Thailand has been worst hit \u2013 with more than a third of provinces flooded, parts of the capital under water and nearly 600 dead. The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) estimates that 250 people have died in Cambodia after heavy monsoon rains led to the country&apos;s worst floods in a decade. Vietnam, Burma and the Philippines have also seen more than 100 dead and hundreds of thousands more displaced. As the waters gradually recede, attention is now turning to the post-flood effects on the countries. Thailand is better placed to cope than its neighbours. There have already been reported outbreaks of cholera and other waterborne infections in Cambodia. Many evacuees have been forced to bed down on plastic sheets laid on muddy ground close to livestock and pets \u2013 leading to serious risks of disease. Thailand, with well-equipped evacuation centres \u2013 staffed by medical personnel and bustling with volunteers handing out regular meals \u2013 faces different challenges. Widespread urban flooding in a developed capital city like Bangkok is &quot;pretty much unprecedented&quot;, according to Mark Thomas, Unicef&apos;s chief of communications. The floods have shut down factories, affected large numbers of small businesses, and disrupted national and international supply chains \u2013 leaving tens of thousands of workers like Agapot jobless. The country&apos;s important tourism industry is also suffering. Arrivals to the international airport, Suvarnabhumi, outside Bangkok, are down 25%, even though the airport and tourist areas in the south have been unaffected by the floods. With damage to industry, tourism and agriculture, the Thai chamber of commerce estimates the total flood costs will be around $11bn. The government has announced a compensation scheme for households affected by flooding. However, a Bangkok Post investigation found the process for claiming was long and bureaucratic \u2013 with families needing documents that many had lost in the floods. Mol Plungjamras, a Bangkok resident, had mixed feelings about the plan: &quot;[The money&apos;s] not enough to renovate the house, but it&apos;s better than nothing,&quot; she said. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, visiting Thailand last week, said he had, &quot;emphasised the importance of learning lessons from this mega flooding&quot;. Ban was en route to the Durban climate change conference where he is calling for a $100bn fund to help developing countries mitigate the impact of global warming. While individual events such as the flooding in south-east Asia can&apos;t be causally linked to climate change, they do demonstrate the impact that an increased frequency of weather extremes will have on countries in the region. With sea level rises also likely to present a serious risk of urban flooding around the world, Bangkok&apos;s experience could serve as a template for future disaster management. Unicef&apos;s Thomas said so far he&apos;d been impressed by the government&apos;s response. &quot;Given the amount of water, the authorities have done a pretty good job,&quot; he said. However, the real test will begin when the flood waters start to recede and those displaced have to return home. Agapot is currently satisfied with the evacuation provision, but he is worried about the future. &quot;We need government support, money and jobs,&quot; he said.

An investigation into the extermination of the animal has led back to a dubious claim \u2013 one that has gone viral in Vietnam in recent years \u2013 that powdered rhino horn cures cancer. The rumour, which has no basis in science or traditional Chinese medicine, is believed responsible for a surge in demand that is blamed for the loss of three rhino populations in the past year, a wildlife NGO claimed this week. It has prompted conservation groups to begin an urgent review of strategies to identify and affect trends in consumer behaviour. The Javan rhino was declared extinct in Vietnam last month after the last one was found dead with a bullet in its leg and its horn sawn off. This month, it was followed by Africa&apos;s western black rhinoceros and by warnings that the Sumatran rhino is on the brink of extinction in Indonesia. This followed years of relative stability. The illegal rhino market went quiet in the late 90s as the two main sources of demand \u2013 dagger handles in Yemen and fever suppressants in China \u2013 were choked with a mix of government crackdowns and viable alternatives. As recently as 2007, only 13 rhinos were poached in South Africa. This year, the number is already 341. &quot;We couldn&apos;t understand what was happening at first,&quot; said Steven Broad of Traffic, a wildlife conservation group. &quot;Then we noticed unusual demand from Vietnam. This had not previously been a major market so at first we assumed this was a staging point for China. But now we believe, Vietnam is the final destination.&quot; The cause appears to be a rumour, started in Vietnam five or six years ago, that rhino horn had cured cancer in a former politician. The politician was not named, nor were there any details on the cancer supposedly cured. But the rumour spread rapidly and the price of rhino horn surged, recently hitting a record high of more than $60,000 a kilogramme \u2013 a higher price than gold. This prompted poachers to dust off their rifles and take greater risks. Rangers have shot dead 16 poachers since last year. Others are using helicopters for hunts. Killings have also increased in Kenya and Tanzania. In Britain, thieves have broken into a museum to steal rhino horn. Legal trophy hunts have suddenly been flooded with applicants from Vietnam, some of whom had clearly never handled a gun before. Some speculate that it may come from China. Others that the rumour was deliberately started by collectors and dealers of rhino horn, whose stocks have now surged in value. Other factors may also be at play, as many rhino horn collectors in China also invest in ivory products, expecting them to rise in value as the animals become scarcer. Many questions remain. But for now, conservationists say the case shows the need to rethink their approach. Until now this has focused on protecting animals in the wild, but there is increasing recognition that more work is needed to identify and change consumer behaviour. &quot;The loss of our last rhino is a sad story,&quot; said Nguyen Van Ahn, a former activist now working for Vietnam&apos;s ministry of natural resources. &quot;We have to do more to ensure the same doesn&apos;t happen to other endangered animals. I think we have to pay more attention on the demand side. We didn&apos;t do that enough before.&quot; The stakes are high and not just for rhino. In Vietnam alone, the Indochinese tiger, Asian elephant, saola, Tonkin snub-nosed monkey and Siamese crocodile are all on the brink of vanishing. Elsewhere in Asia, many other animals are at risk from the surge in demand. This global trend has been accelerated by the spread of internet commerce, international travel and the rapid development of China and other Asian economies, where affluent modern lifestyles and traditional habits of wild animal consumption are proving a particularly lethal mix for pangolins, tigers, sharks, elephants and a host of other species. The sense of crisis has been evident in three separate workshops on demand reduction organised in Asia in the past two weeksThis week in Hong Kong, WWF, Traffic, the Environment Investigation Agency, the International Fund for Animal Welfare and the World Bank joined marketing experts, media strategists and government officials in an attempt to draw up new approaches to reducing demand for tiger and rhino products in China and Vietnam. This followed an &quot;emergency brainstorming session&quot; to arrest the depletion of Asia&apos;s wildlife, organised in Bangkok the previous week by the ASEAN wildlife enforcement network, the US international development agency and Freeland. Wildaid also called a gathering of interested parties on a similar subject in Beijing. &quot;Escalating demand in Asia and the poaching crisis in Africa and Asia perhaps are wake-up calls for many conservation groups,&quot; said Grace Ge Gabriel, the Asia regional director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare. &quot;The fact is that putting a price tag on an endangered species is the fastest way to push it towards extinction. To reduce commercial exploitation of wildlife, we need to address every link on the trade chain, from anti-poaching to stopping smuggling to reducing market demand.&quot; Conservationists have been trying for years to discourage purchases of ivory, whale meat, uncertified wood products and other items that up the pressure on endangered species. While this is less glamorous, more difficult and harder to measure than the establishment of nature reserves and the fight against poachers, it is increasingly important as wild supplies decline and wealthy consumers increase. In future, more effort is likely to go into the work of surveying consumers, monitoring shopkeepers and launching marketing campaigns to shift habits, traditions and cultural norms. The challenge and possibility were both evident around the venue for the Hong Kong meeting, which was located in the heart of the territory&apos;s massive shark fin market. It is estimated that between 25 million and 75 million sharks are killed each year to supply this billion-dollar business, which has devastated several species. Government action to tackle this unsustainable harvest has been slow or non-existent so conservation groups have set their sights on consumers. This year, the WildAid international ambassador and basketball star Yao Ming spoke out against shark fin soup. Earlier this week, the Peninsula hotel \u2013 one of the most prestigious in Hong Kong \u2013 said it would stop serving the dish from January. It was a rare victory that campaigners hope to build on. &quot;Conservation groups need to help the hospitality industry develop a sustainable seafood market,&quot; said Stanley Shea of Bloom Association, a Hong Kong-based NGO that is pressing other hotels to follow suit. The demand-side strategy, he said, can help more conventional measures to protect the wild. &quot;Now is the time for conservation groups to rethink their approach.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 29 November 2011.

Now the freelance Spanish superspy has resurfaced at the age of 75, cheekily calling on diplomats from his home country to rescue him from a tight situation involving a private jet, Sierra Leone border guards and a mysterious cargo of gold masks. Diplomatic sources said that, after landing at Sierra Leone&apos;s Lungi airport in October, Paesa was locked up for three days \u2013 but used his influence with the Spanish authorities to be flown out to safety in France. For years Paesa featured on Interpol&apos;s most wanted list after a Spanish court accused him of laundering millions of pounds stolen by a corrupt senior socialist government official. Paesa had previously been involved in a sting operation against the Basque terrorist group Eta in 1986, in which he sold them missiles fitted with radio transmitters so that they could be tracked by the police. His name was also mentioned in the mid-1990s as a middleman between the socialist government of prime minister Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez and the so-called Anti Terrorist Liberation Group (GAL), set up by Spain&apos;s interior ministry to carry out attacks in south-west France on suspected Eta members. The group hired mercenaries from Portugal, Italy and elsewhere to carry out attacks that killed 26 people \u2013 a third of whom turned out to have nothing to do with Eta. Paesa&apos;s contacts were said to be several bag men who worked in Gonz\u00e1lez&apos;s office when he was prime minister between 1982 and 1996 \u2013 though courts found insufficient evidence to convict him of any GAL-related charges. His close contacts with senior Spanish police officials meant that civil guard boss Luis Rold\u00e1n decided to turn to him when courts found he had been demanding commission for handing out contracts to build new police barracks around Spain. Paesa was believed to have laundered the estimated \u00a38m that Rold\u00e1n had amassed, and to have then helped him flee to Laos in 1994. He then persuaded Rold\u00e1n to travel to Bangkok, Thailand, where he was picked up by Spanish police in 1995. Newspaper reports at the time claimed the Spanish government paid Paesa up to \u00a31m for luring his former friend to Bangkok. In 1998 Paesa&apos;s sister published a death notice in a Spanish newspaper. It claimed her brother had died of a heart attack and been cremated in Thailand. His family asked the Dominican monks at San Pedro de Carde\u00f1a, near Burgos, to pray for his soul. But when none of his family turned up to hear the monks say mass for him, suspicions were raised about whether he was really dead. About \u00a34m had disappeared from his bank account in Madrid a few months earlier. It was not until 2004, however, that rumours surfaced that Paesa was alive and well and living under a false name in Luxembourg. Smudgy photographs taken by private detectives working for clients who claimed that Paesa, now known as Francisco Pando, had ripped them off were published by El Mundo newspaper. By then Paesa was reportedly claiming to be Argentine and had a young, blonde girlfriend and a passport that took 14 years off his real age of 68. When a judge ruled that the money-laundering charges he faced in connection with the Rold\u00e1n case had timed out, he was able to live openly again. Rather than enjoying a quiet and opulent retirement in Luxembourg, however, he appears to have returned to a life of high-risk adventure and strange cross-frontier transactions. Paesa travelled to Sierra Leone &quot;representing a French lawyer to verify a cargo of antiques, including old perfume bottles and Chinese golden masks&quot;, according to the Cadena Ser radio network. He got into trouble with border guards, who detained him, then turned for help to Spanish officials. He was flown out of Sierra Leone with the aid of the Spanish foreign ministry to France where he was released without charges. Spanish diplomatic sources said they believed he was really involved in a major gold transaction.", "publicationDate": "2011-11-29T18:30:38Z", "tags": ["Espionage", "World news", "Spain", "Europe", "Sierra Leone", "Africa"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/29/spanish-superspy-franciso-paesa", "title": "Spanish superspy Francisco Paesa, 75, gets out of yet another scrape", "sentences": ["He then persuaded Rold\u00e1n to travel to Bangkok, Thailand, where he was picked up by Spanish police in 1995.", "Newspaper reports at the time claimed the Spanish government paid Paesa up to \u00a31m for luring his former friend to Bangkok."]}, {"article": "A sharp fall in passenger numbers, moving some passport checks abroad and the presence of more volunteers than expected appear to lie behind the limited impact of the strike on airports so far. The warnings of disruption from Heathrow and other airports, including the possibility of delays of up to 12 hours, have led to airlines offering passengers the chance to switch at no extra cost to flights on other days. Passengers seem to have heeded the warnings, as early morning flights arrived with 30% fewer travellers than normal. The queues also appear to have been shortened by a special operation suspending detailed passport checks at Heathrow for visitors from five countries outside Europe who do not need biometric visas to enter Britain. British Airport Authority manager Steve Morgan told the Guardian that the authorities in the US, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand were carrying out full passport checks before Heathrow-bound passengers on the plane. Once they arrived in London their passports were just being scanned to check the person matches the passport. The third reason for the much smoother than expected situation in the Heathrow arrivals halls is that the border desks seem to be at two-thirds staffing capacity rather than the 50% or below levels predicted. Those carrying out low-level checks include 120 police officers seconded to the UK Border Agency (UKBA), Whitehall civil servants with the necessary security clearance, including from the Ministry of Defence and even a couple of recruits from the Downing Street policy unit. Colin Matthews, BAA&apos;s chief executive, said: &quot;We would have had pandemonium here today if we had not taken the steps we have.&quot; The UKBA was also cautiously optimistic: &quot;Early signs show our contingency plans are minimising the impact of strike action, but waiting times at some ports may still be slightly longer than normal.&quot; The ISU, which represents those who staff the passport desks, said that 4,000 out of the 6,500 UKBA staff involved were expected to walk out. The ISU deputy general secretary, Lucy Moreton, said 22 of the 23 UKBA staff at the Coquelles passport control point on the Calais side of the Channel Tunnel had walked off the night shift. &quot;They have no contingency staff in northern France,&quot; she said. &quot;We have heard that the French police had helicopters up in the air photographing the queueing lorries backing up onto the A16 motorway.&quot; She said there were also queues at Gatwick, and disputed claims that there were no delays at Heathrow, saying that there had been queues of three to four hours in terminals two and three earlier today when flights from north America and west and north Africa had arrived. . Passengers from Australia, Thailand, Nigeria and the US, arriving at Terminal 3, were filing through passport checks faster than usual on Wednesday morning, according to passengers and airport officials in arrivals. Piles of bottled water, fruit and even nappies and baby food placed in the immigration hall in anticipation of eight- to 10-hour delays have gone untouched. &quot;It was the fastest we&apos;ve ever cleared immigration here,&quot; said Sue Bates, with her husband, Ben, coming off a flight from Bangkok after a holiday in Koh Samui, Thailand. Foreign nationals sped through too. Olanrewaju Adewunmi, 58, flying in from Lagos via Madrid, said he waited no more than two minutes before clearing the border after a face check and passport scan. &quot;I was expecting something much worse and hours of waiting before I got out of here,&quot; he said. Morgan, normally in a suit and tie as BAA&apos;s director of capital projects, had donned a purple fleece and a &quot;Here to help&quot; badge to cover the 4am-noon shift in the arrivals hall. BA and Virgin had cancelled some planes, and airlines had responded to calls to run lighter passenger loads. There were even strong tail winds across the Atlantic last night, allowing flights from the US to arrive an hour early at 5am instead of 6am, clearing the decks. The flight screens showed that only four of around 25 flights expected before noon were cancelled. &quot;We were expecting people to be camping out here in the arrivals hall for eight to 10 hours waiting for passengers, but we have had people saying we should have a strike every day,&quot; said Morgan.", "publicationDate": "2011-11-30T09:35:37Z", "tags": ["30 November public sector strike", "Air transport", "Trade unions", "UK news", "Public sector pensions", "Society", "Heathrow", "Travel", "World news", "Public sector careers"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/nov/30/heathrow-airport-unaffected-by-strike", "title": "Airports largely unaffected by strike", "sentences": ["&quot;It was the fastest we&apos;ve ever cleared immigration here,&quot; said Sue Bates, with her husband, Ben, coming off a flight from Bangkok after a holiday in Koh Samui, Thailand."]}, {"article": "The immigration hall at Heathrow terminal 3 was about as quiet as a library.

He didn&apos;t have much to do, explaining that a series of factors had eased the flow. He said he believed that the Border Agency had agreed with authorities in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan that they would carry out thorough passport checks before boarding, allowing the replacement border staff at Heathrow to carry out faster face and passport scan checks. BA and Virgin had cancelled some of their flights and other airlines had responded to the airport operator&apos;s call to run lighter passenger loads.

Those civil servants carrying out the faster checks included 120 police officers seconded to the Border Agency, Whitehall civil servants with the necessary security clearance, including from the Ministry of Defence, and even a couple of recruits from Downing Street. Colin Matthews, chief executive of BAA, said the smooth running of immigration was a victory for the airport&apos;s strategy of co-operation with the airlines, which reduced passenger numbers by about a third compared with a normal 30 November through running flights with fewer customers, and cancelling flights. Of the normal 1,200 flights coming in and out of Heathrow on Wednesday, 30 arrivals and 30 departures were scheduled cancellations, BAA confirmed. &quot;It would have been pandemonium here today if we hadn&apos;t taken the steps we have taken,&quot; Matthews said. The airport was most worried about the arrivals peak in early morning but after that passed with limited disruption confidence grew crisis had been averted. However, Matthews warned there could be a knock-on effect on Thursday when passengers arrive on alternative flights and there are forecasts of high winds. He was expecting Heathrow to be &quot;extra busy&quot;. Private security guards employed in the immigrations hall reported that there were more people checking passports than normal. The airport operator, BAA, was clearly expecting serious queues and had erected a snack station on the walk to passport control with water, apples, crisps and even vanity packs with deodorant wipes, shower gel and make-up remover. It was largely untouched as passengers swept through. Matthews said the strike would still cost airlines and the airport millions of pounds, because of reduced passenger numbers, and he criticised the action. &quot;Any disruption to passengers at Heathrow damages the UK and its image to passengers flying in,&quot; he said. &quot;It has hurt our business and hurts the UK. It is damaging.&quot; The ISU, which represents the passport desk staff, said that 4,000 out of the 6,500 UKBA workers involved had been expected to walk out.

If she&apos;d tweeted her line in Bangkok, she might well have been jailed by the beyond-paranoid apparatchiks who work tirelessly to punish any public utterance that might be deemed offensive to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, his family, or the monarchy itself. Sullivan&apos;s Twitter snark went to her then-tiny group of followers following a school field trip to hear Kansas Governor Sam Brownback. It was, indeed, a bit juvenile: &quot;Just made mean comments at gov. brownback and told him he sucked, in person #heblowsalot.&quot; Actually, she hadn&apos;t done any such thing in person; it was just a joke with friends. But she was expressing a thought that lots of young people \u2013 and many of their parents and grandparents \u2013 feel about politicians of all ilks these days. But if her tweet was juvenile, the response was downright childish. An aide to the governor whose job apparently includes monitoring social networks to learn what people are saying about the boss, got in touch with the event&apos;s organizers, who got in touch with the school principal, who called in Sullivan and, she told reporters, told her she was way out of line and insisted she apologise. She declined. Naturally, the affair went viral on the internet, earning the governor, his super-sensitive aide and the principal an assortment of derision. I was one of many who thought the governor, not Sullivan, was the one who most needed to apologise, because his aide&apos;s actions had demonstrated a fairly thin understanding of free speech. To his credit, Brownback did just that. He called his staff&apos;s response an &quot;over-reaction&quot; and called free speech &quot;among our most treasured freedoms&quot;. He also made a reference to the &quot;values of civility and decorum&quot; \u2013 plainly aimed at Sullivan, whose tweet could have had considerably more of both. But the story demonstrated a number of internet realities, not least of which were: the internet&apos;s ability to shame foolish official behavior; and the ability of thin-skinned officials in repressive regimes to exact revenge. The teenager (who now has more than 15,000 followers) would be wise, for example, to weigh her luck in not living in Thailand, where free speech about the monarchy can lead to much worse than a lecture from supercilious adults. In that southeast Asian nation, it can led straight to jail, and the government has vigorously enforced its l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law. In the age of the internet, enforcement of the law has taken on downright absurd qualities. A 61-year-old man was sentenced to 20 years in prison for texting a message that might have been insulting to the queen, and now the government has said it would look unfavorably on any Facebook users who would dare even to &quot;like&quot; a statement that was considered to be violating the law. I have no opinion one way or the other about Thailand&apos;s royal family. Perhaps, they are as good, or strange, or comical, as any other monarchy&apos;s royals, constitutional or otherwise. But I would wager that they would be able to tolerate insults more readily than their nation&apos;s political class seems to think. The rulers of Thailand plainly believe that the internal political benefits of enforcing their l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law outweigh the damage it causes to the country&apos;s image. Maybe they are right in this calculation, but they are wrong in the sweep of history. Criticism of the ruling class is fundamental to any notion of free speech, and a nation that can&apos;t tolerate such speech is telling the world that it is insecure in a deep way. Thailand&apos;s politicians might take a lesson from Governor Brownback.

Yet director St\u00e9phane Briz\u00e9&apos;s quietly tremendous Mademoiselle Chambon (2009, Axiom, 12) does a pretty good job of reminding us that, in terms of tragic romantic clout, less is often more. Vincent Lindon and Sandrine Kiberlain are perfectly cast as the married man and single schoolteacher who discover an unexpected bond that causes them both to question their position in life. While their backgrounds may be incongruous and their social circles incompatible, each recognises in the other something that fills a hitherto unacknowledged absence. As their relationship develops from professional attachment through furtive friendship to something altogether more dangerous, so the threads of their day-to-day existence begin to unravel. Should he abandon the wife with whom he has built a home to pursue a fleeting dream inspired in part by the strange reverie of Elgar&apos;s &quot;Salut d&apos;Amour&quot;? Or is the thought of hurting others more painful than the prospect of simply living with heartbreak? Eloquently adapted from Eric Holder&apos;s novel, this low-key, C\u00e9sar-winning gem relies on tiny gestures \u2013 a glance, a wry smile, a longing look \u2013 to suggest great passion and inner turmoil, all conjured with wit, grace and honesty by Lindon and Kiberlain. Imagine the broiling, cataclysmic desire that so unhinged Kristin Scott Thomas&apos;s heroine in Leaving (a film that ended with bloodshed and chaos) being left instead to simmer and cool, somehow condensing its power in the process. Don&apos;t be fooled by the apparent politeness of the action; there are raw nerves exposed here, albeit within the confines of two apparently well-ordered lives. DVD extras include deleted scenes, wisely trimmed by Briz\u00e9, who understands the virtue of brevity and economy, and who also offers an insightful interview. From the suburban to the spectacular, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011, Warner, 12) brings to a close the most successful series in the history of British cinema \u2013 albeit American-funded. After the metaphorical breath-holding of the first part, this ambitiously dark last act sees Harry finally facing his eternal nemesis, Voldemort, with loss of life and real and present danger very much the order of the day. Having spent so long in the company of these characters (many viewers will have grown up with the Hogwarts ensemble, their school years matched by those of JK Rowling&apos;s young wizards), it is impossible not to feel an enormous sense of foreboding as the final battle approaches. Director David Yates takes full advantage of the dread potential of the story, with dark skies and thunderous spectres looming like the ragged horsemen of the apocalypse. Even those familiar with the novels will feel unsettled as the hour of reckoning arrives and it is to Yates&apos;s great credit that he never underplays the horror, clearly acknowledging the series&apos; debt to the great British traditions of Hammer. There are a few unanswered questions (what, for example, happened to &quot;Harry&apos;s Best Speech&quot;?) and some may quibble at the dreamy tying up of all those loose ends, but these are ultimately minor distractions. From unpromising beginnings (the pedestrian Philosopher&apos;s Stone) through ecstatic reinventions (Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n&apos;s sparkling Prisoner of Azkaban) to this thundering finale, the Potter series has delivered the goods. Harry and his friends may have grown up, but their coming of age (handily compiled in an eight-movie box set) will be with us for decades to come. While the Potter series matured with each progressive instalment, The Hangover Part II (2011, Warner, 15) manages the almost impossible feat of retreating even further into retarded adolescence than its already screamingly unfunny predecessor. Thus the locker-room riffs of yore are revisited in louder, cruder, crasser form, with the action transposed from Vegas to Bangkok, where jokes about transvestites, masturbation, prostitutes and comedy monkeys are all given an unpleasantly &quot;exotic&quot; twist. Indeed the funniest thing about this relentless sleazy sequel is the fact that when Mike Tyson&apos;s facial tattoo artist sued the film-makers for &quot;stealing&quot; his artwork, the studio responded by threatening to remove every shot of it digitally rather than having to pay royalties on the second-hand gag. Ha! Other than that, it&apos;s the usual dreary cocktail of booze, semen and casual misogyny (brides find it cute when their men go on a lovable drugs and hookers rampage, apparently) with added tourist-class racism thrown in for good measure. Thank heaven for the lightweight fun of Captain America: The First Avenger (2011, Paramount, 12), which addresses the problems of Marvel&apos;s most politically suspect superhero head on, reinventing him as a laughable beefcake forced to prat around in tights punching stage Nazis to sell war bonds rather than fighting the good fight. Chris Evans makes the most of a potentially risible role, the design is nostalgically eye-catching and the effects are suitably whizz-bang. Most encouragingly, director Joe Johnston (who directed the overlooked treat The Rocketeer) seems to have found his feet again after the whopping misstep that was The Wolfman. Finally, We Were Here (2011, Peccadillo, E) offers a moving and engrossing tribute to the indomitable strength of the human spirit as San Franciscans remember pulling together in the wake of the Aids epidemic that broke in the early 80s.

Starting in early October, floodwaters from an exceptional rainy season flowed south through the country, affecting more than 3 million people and causing at least 595 deaths. Two months later, 2m households and countless businesses are still affected. In this time of crisis, the country and its flood victims need every bit of help they can get. A lot is coming from companies. Thailand has a business culture that strongly emphasises charity. On top of that, a growing awareness of corporate social responsibility has led many companies to get involved. Companies are contributing to flood relief efforts in several ways: they are donating funds, purchasing emergency food, water and other supplies, leveraging their business and client networks to raise funds, and contributing their core goods and services (including infrastructure and technical expertise). Many companies have focused on the first two by giving money, food and water. This kind of support is critical in helping to meet immediate, essential needs. Yet at the same time, Thailand has also seen an impressive number of initiatives that fall into the latter two categories: companies have found innovative ways to leverage their networks and direct their core goods and services towards flood relief, often in partnership with others. Some of the most interesting examples are from companies leveraging their core expertise. Cisco Systems, Rama Hospital and TOT, an internet provider, have joined forces to set up an online clinic to provide tele-health care services to patients in government flood relief centres. Google, Kasikorn Bank and CRM-C, computing consultancts, have linked up to offer a seminar series on how NGOs can use Google&apos;s platform for communications, organisation and information sharing \u2013 a service particularly welcome given that flooded offices mean staff are working from home and dispersed across various locations. Of course, Google&apos;s Bangkok Flood Map has been a big help too. CP All, which operates the 7-11 convenience stores in Thailand, is harnessing the power of its supply chain by offering to distribute and sell products of small businesses damaged by the floods in its stores. Krungthai Card is offering zero-interest loans to flood victims with good credit, waiving interest and fees for two months. The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand is providing free services to repair electric appliances and vehicles, and GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical giant, has deployed staff to stricken areas. In-kind goods contributions have an interesting role in flood relief. Esso donated petrol to power the boats used to push water out to the sea, and Amata Corp turned a plot of land in one of its industrial estates into a free, guarded parking space for flood victims&apos; cars. Other companies are leveraging their networks of companies and clients to raise money. For example, 12 of Thailand&apos;s biggest companies have come together under an initiative called Power of Thai in which they will sell products branded with the initiative logo and donate the profits to flood relief efforts. Coca Cola through it&apos;s Reunite, Relieve and Rebuild Thailand campaign has announced that commercial advertising for all Coca Cola brands will be put on hold and committed advertising space will be devoted to raising money and mobilising volunteers to help the Thai Red Cross and Habitat for Humanity&apos;s relief and rebuilding efforts. The point is that, during a time of crisis, companies seem to be surprisingly agile at doing what one would hope they would do with all corporate social responsibility programmes \u2013 matching their core capabilities to community needs in a meaningful way. Why does this matter? Because matching core skills to community needs allows companies to maximise their impact \u2013 for many reasons \u2013 including the fact that these kinds of programmes tend to run longer and bring more lasting results than one-off acts of charity. Most flood relief efforts are temporary. They appear and disappear as quickly as the disaster has come and gone from the news. But CSR strategies that are tied to the core business tend to relate to longer-term business strategies, and therefore to be more sustainable. In fact, many of the initiatives above emerged out of longer-term strategies that were already established. These examples of corporate engagement in flood relief show exceptional creativity and highlight how much companies can benefit society through their core products and skills. Where companies sometimes struggle to build their corporate social responsibility strategies around core business competencies (rather than using doctors to paint schools), in this time of crisis, companies in Thailand seem to be doing a great job of matching their core resources to the nation&apos;s needs. May this trend continue well beyond the crisis.

Abdel Hakim Belhadj, head of the Tripoli Military Council and a former leader of the militant Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, is suing ministers and MI6 for the part he claims they played in secretly sending him and his wife to Libya in March 2004. Belhadj was then living in China with his wife, Fatima Bouchar. They decided to seek asylum in Britain but were detained and deported to Malaysia, where they were immediately taken into the custody. They were told they would be allowed to travel to the UK via Bangkok. They were then handed over to the US authorities and taken to what they say was a US secret prison. In between interrogation sessions, Belhadj says, he was hung by his wrists from hooks in his cell for prolonged periods while hooded and blindfolded, and viciously beaten. The couple were then rendered by the US to Libya. Belhadj says he was hooded and shackled to the floor of the plane in a stress position, unable to sit or lie during the entire 17-hour flight, which is believed to have stopped to refuel in Diego Garcia, the British Indian Ocean territory. Neither he nor his wife was aware that the other was on the plane. In Libya, Belhadj was detained for six years in some of the country&apos;s most brutal jails and was interrogated by &quot;foreign&quot; agents. He says he was savagely beaten, hung from walls, and cut off from human contact and daylight before being sentenced to death during a 15-minute trial about four years into his detention. Belhadj \u2013 also known as Abu Abdullah al-Sadiq, a commander of anti-Gaddafi forces in the 2011 Libyan conflict \u2013 has instructed the law firm Leigh Day to sue the British government, with the help of the legal charity Reprieve. Belhadj is the second Libyan dissident to launch legal action against the British government in recent months. In October, Sami al-Saadi launched an action to claim damages from the UK after a cache of secret documents discovered in Tripoli exposed the pivotal role played by MI6 in his rendition to one of Muammar Gaddafi&apos;s jails. Cori Crider, Reprieve&apos;s legal director, said: &quot;Mr Belhadj was totally willing to come to an agreement with the British government. He made it absolutely plain that what he cared about was an open apology, and for those who tortured him and his wife to be brought to justice.&quot; Sapna Malik, from Leigh Day, said: &quot;The barbaric treatment which our clients describe, both at the hands of the Americans and the Libyans, is beyond comprehension, and yet it appears that the UK was responsible for setting off this torturous chain of events.&quot; Britain&apos;s role in the Belhadj renditions was revealed in a letter from Sir Mark Allen, former director of counter-terrorism at MI6, to Moussa Koussa, the head of the Libyan intelligence agency at the time. In a letter dated 18 March 2004, Allen said: &quot;I congratulate you on the safe arrival of Abu Abdullah al-Sadiq. This was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over the years. I am so glad. I was grateful to you for helping the officer we sent out last week.&quot; The Foreign Office says the inquiry set up under a former appeal court judge, Sir Peter Gibson, will consider whether Britain was involved in, or aware of, the improper treatment and rendition of detainees. Whitehall officials say MI6 told ministers about the rendition of Belhadj and his wife, and will say so in evidence to the Gibson inquiry. However, most of the evidence to Gibson will be held in secret.", "publicationDate": "2011-12-19T18:03:47Z", "tags": ["Libya", "Rendition", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa", "UK news", "MI6"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/19/libyan-rebel-abdel-hakim-belhadj", "title": "Libyan rebel leader sues Britain over rendition ordeal", "sentences": ["They were told they would be allowed to travel to the UK via Bangkok."]}, {"article": "&quot;Remake&quot; has become a dirty word in cinema. Hollywood can do what it likes to its own movies, but it&apos;s how it treats everyone else&apos;s that has made it notorious: money-obsessed, and as culturally sensitive as Stalin after a night on the Stolichnaya. Director David Fincher admitted as much at the start of the publicity run for his remake of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. &quot;I know we are playing into the European, and certainly the Swedish, predisposition that this is a giant monetary land grab,&quot; he told the fansite FincherFanatic.com. &quot;You&apos;re co-opting a phenomenon. Now, there are plenty of reasons to believe we can make it equally entertaining of a movie. But the resentment is already engendered, in a weird way. It&apos;s bizarre.&quot; It&apos;s unusual for a director to be so transparent about the whole painful process \u2013 and his version of Dragon Tattoo seems to be the new, culturally enlightened face of US remakes. The film, instead of being roughly uprooted and repotted on Yankee soil, takes place in a kind of ersatz Sweden. Daniel Craig keeps his English vowels, but most of the cast speak the English dialogue with Europeanised accents of various weights. That includes Rooney Mara&apos;s Lisbeth Salander, who even slips in a &quot;Tack!&quot; [thanks] at one point. It&apos;s the one blatant move from Fincher, who everywhere else makes sure the film never betrays its setting with his usual forensic zeal. He even recreated a lakeside dock in an LA studio after he was refused shooting rights by the Abba member who owned the location. That&apos;s the new school of remakes. Hollywood&apos;s normal way during the noughties was more like what Salander does to her guardian with a dildo. For every The Ring (even shorn of Japanese uncanniness, the Gore Verbinski version rightly had its admirers), there were the Quarantines, the One Missed Calls, the Dinner for Schmucks. Nasty bastardisations. These were operating under the old unilateral ethos \u2013 render a foreign-language story palatable for the subtitle-phobic US audience \u2013 that occasionally produces such sizeable hits as The Birdcage ($124m US domestic) or Vanilla Sky ($101m). But with Hollywood&apos;s creative gas-tank running on empty and a desperation for ideas, the remake took on the air of the easy option in the noughties. There were too many, put together with too little care. It probably came down to economics. The critic Gary G Xu has compared the remake factory to a kind of outsourcing \u2013 pushing R&amp;D costs on to other parties \u2013 that could be seen as part of the wider Asia-wards shift of industrial production. In the book East Asian Cinemas, Xu writes: &quot;Outsourced are the jobs of assistant producers who are the initial script screeners, of the personnel involved in the scripting process, of supporting crew for various details during production, of the marketing team and, increasingly, of directors. Sooner or later, the unions within the Hollywood system will come to realise the outsourcing nature of remaking.&quot; It&apos;s a fascinating idea. Hollywood saves money by cherrypicking stories and creative talent that have been roadtested in other markets. But was it truly cost-effective? A lot of the noughties remakes still played it cautious. Many of them, especially the J-horror smash-and-grabs, were low- to medium-budget films that, without heavy marketing muscle, made modest US box office in the $15-30m range. (This partly explains the shoddy quality.) Of the ones that spent higher, there were several prominent flops that failed to connect in the market for which they had been reshoed: Bangkok Dangerous ($45m budget/$15.3m US domestic), Dark Water ($60m budget/$25m) and Let Me In ($20m budget/$12.1m). Of the really big successes, you&apos;d imagine the star power, script overhauls, beefed-up production values and marketing needed to propel them upwards would easily offset the modest initial savings made by buying in intellectual property. The Departed ($132m US domestic), The Ring ($129m), The Grudge ($110m), Vanilla Sky, Insomnia($67.3m) all cashed in. But at that level, they were beyond remake economics \u2013 they were playing the high-stakes blockbuster game. Fincher, with a $100m budget, is at this table too. But his Dragon Tattoo, spritzed with its light fragrance of Scandinavian malaise, is clearly a step towards a new kind of remake for the era of international box office. Audiences are better travelled than they used to be and more ready to sample culture in a foreign-language. Where remakes come into being, maintaining the essence of the original work is becoming a plus point \u2013 like with the British adaptation of Wallander. The US Dragon Tattoo also follows in the footsteps of Columbia&apos;s remake of J-horror The Grudge \u2013 which also kept its predecessors&apos; Japan setting. It was more elegant, though, in explaining the transition to English-speaking characters: they actually are English speakers (Sarah Michelle Gellar&apos;s character is a care nurse who takes a job in Tokyo at the hexed house of the three previous Japanese movies). So foreignness can be a selling point for a remake now. Fincher safeguards the Swedishness with what is essentially a form of posh dubbing \u2013 substituting actors instead of a new audio track. But his method surely has its limits. It&apos;s hard to imagine it working outside of a western setting: anything set in Asia or Africa would seem ridiculous, or even a bit colonial. And it hides what is, in many ways, still a traditional remake. The black-lacquered title sequence announces the new ownership, and the ascension of Stieg Larsson&apos;s Millennium trilogy to global media-brand status. Of course this could only be permitted to happen in Hollywood hands: this is Scandinavian crime fiction as 007 extravaganza. It&apos;s gone respectable, in other words, and on one crucial point it pushes even further in making sure that the star of the show is palatable to her new public: Lisbeth Salander actually asks permission from Mikael Blomkvist to kill with the serial killer, and she doesn&apos;t even get to deal the mortal blow. She is no longer Noomi Rapace&apos;s feminist avenging angel (though Fincher&apos;s version is truer to the book on this point than its Swedish adaptation). The new Dragon Tattoo exists in a strange remake twilight \u2013 half-native, half-Hollywood \u2013 and that may be the compromise for the next few years. But really, we shouldn&apos;t care whether films take this respectful route or go in for the unabashed story-heist of old. The greats, from Shakespeare to Shaw, went for the grand theft with no apologies. They knew you can&apos;t keep a good yarn locked up. The local always has the universal buried within it; a true remake is the one able to dig that out. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 December 2011.

Cleaners scrub the floor with chemical cleaning agents, workers rip mouldy tiles from the ceilings and engineers try to salvage what equipment they can at the Hana Microelectronics factory. Production is expected to resume any day. But it will not be business as usual for many months, if ever. Looming over this clean-up operation \u2013 like countless others in homes, businesses and government offices in the Thai capital \u2013 is a concern that such disasters will strike with more frequency in the future unless the human flaws and climate risks are addressed more seriously. &quot;The big question from our customers is: &apos;Will it flood again?&apos;&quot; said Worawit Sriburanasorn, a senior manager at Hana who fought the waters with diesel pumps and protective walls. It is a question on many minds as Thai policymakers consider issues that are likely to affect other countries in the future: whether to build stronger defences, move to higher ground or otherwise adapt to the risks posed by political mismanagement and a changing climate. &quot;We are on the frontline of climate change. As we see rising temperatures, more rain and a higher sea level, Bangkok will be very vulnerable,&quot; said Seree Supratid, a professor at Rangsit University and government adviser. &quot;In the talks in Cancun and Durban, they just talk about reducing greenhouse gases, but the disasters are already here. We should shift the emphasis from mitigation to adaptation.&quot; Almost five months have passed since the flooding began in the northern hills of Thailand and then spread slowly down through the central plains to inundate swaths of Bangkok, killing more than 500 people, affecting 12 million others and disrupting business at some of the planet&apos;s biggest industrial parks. The World Bank estimates the damage at 1.4tn baht (\u00a329bn), making it one of the costliest disasters in human history. The stories from the flood are still emerging. Among the most dramatic is that of Hana Microelectronics, which is a key supplier of sensors and chips for Apple&apos;s iPhone and also makes widgets, smart-card readers and touch pads for Samsung, Texas Instruments and Motorola. When its Ayutthaya plant was deluged, the discovery of two crocodiles in the car park and a cobra in a store room disconcerted the staff, but the potential disruption to production caused global consternation. Apple was so worried that it offered helicopters to airlift the 100m chips inside. The government dispatched the Thai navy to ferry 450 pieces of heavy machinery to an alternative factory so that manufacturing could resume. Even so, there was a gap of about two weeks. Richard Han, the chief executive officer, estimated the damage to his plants and equipment at more than $30m (\u00a319m). Lost business could cost three times as much again. &quot;Most of my customers will come back but they won&apos;t bring all their business back,&quot; he said. He too will move some production to an expanded operation in China to hedge against future floods. &quot;One thing we know is that unprecedented weather events are now happening on a regular basis. Add to that gross mismanagement and a lack of infrastructure and it is clear that the government are going to have to prepare better,&quot; he said. &quot;My big worry is that insurers may not accept flood insurance any more. That could be a trigger for the Thai government to step in. If not, we&apos;d have to build up reserves and self insure.&quot; Elsewhere, several districts were still underwater as the end of the year approached. Near Don Muang airport, the motorway resembled a river with trucks, buses and jeeps leaving a wake behind them as they slowly navigated through the water. On Buddhamonthon Road in West Bangkok, people were camping on bridges with their belongings stacked under tarpaulin. Some had lost everything. Uthai Muangpor was wading in a waist-deep pool that had once been the hospital car park where she ran a grilled banana kiosk. &quot;I&apos;m looking for my stove and pans,&quot; she said. &quot;When the flood come, everything I owned floated away. I didn&apos;t have any valuables. But now even my clothes and mattress are gone.&quot; The extent to which climate change is to blame is hard to quantify. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says Bangkok is one of the most vulnerable cities in the world because it sits on a flood plain and has been periodically inundated for centuries. It also suffers from severe subsidence and is at long-term risk from rising sea levels. Scientists estimate that for each degree of warming, the amount of moisture in the air increases by 7%. This year is on course to be the wettest on record, according to the Met Office, which says 1,822mm of rain fell in the first nine months. But even the most ardent campaigners for climate action acknowledge that the government must take the bulk of the responsibility. &quot;The blame for the floods is 30% with nature and 70% with the mismanagement of the authorities,&quot; said Srisuwan Janya, a lawyer and founder of the Stop Global Warming Association. &quot;The government responded too slowly and made errors. It need not have been this bad.&quot; He said upstream dams did not release water early enough in the monsoon season so they had insufficient capacity to contain the huge volumes of rainwater that fell later. One of the three main flood channels running from the north to the south was shut off, adding to the pressure on the remaining two. As the water surged southward, Bangkok found itself more vulnerable than in the past because hundreds of its canals have been blocked up over decades of poorly regulated development. Political leaders then made matters worse by placing too high a priority on the city centre, which was kept dry at the expense of deeper water elsewhere. The erratic climate may have confused decision makers. At the start of the year, the primary concern was drought because the dry season in 2010 had been unusually severe. As a result, dam managers retained water in upstream reservoirs even after the first big rainfall in March, which was three times more than the average in northern Thailand. Faced by these extremes, it was difficult for dam managers to make judgments based on previous weather patterns. This is a key lesson of the flood. &quot;The difficulty of projecting droughts and floods will increase for sure,&quot; said Gernot Laganda, a climate specialist at the United Nations Development Program office in Bangkok. &quot;We cannot rely on historic experience in managing these hazards. The world is not the same any more. Just because this is a once-in-a-century flood, we shouldn&apos;t assume that there won&apos;t be another like it for 100 years.&quot; Faced by an increasingly &quot;vicious interplay of prolonged droughts and fiercer bursts of rain&quot;, Laganda says it will be important to build strong monitoring systems and to start building climate flexible systems. Instead of building high walls and river defences today, he says it makes more sense to strengthen the foundations of existing structures so they can be raised as and when risks become more apparent. The Bangkok governor, Sukhumbhand Paribatra, said the city needed to learn from the disaster. &quot;It&apos;s a wake up call. We need to take a hard look at the problems that may arise from climate change and take a long-term perspective on how to deal with them.&quot; He has proposed more investment in flood mitigation and prevention, namely construction of more retention ponds, drainage tunnels and pumping stations. &quot;It will cost a lot of money. But I don&apos;t think there is any other way unless we change our conceptual approach and allow some areas to be flooded during the flood season.&quot; While a warming planet is part of the backdrop, engineers fear that it may be a distraction from the more pressing concerns of urban planning, erosion and sedimentation. A debate is under way. Surajit Chirawate, who sits on the senate environment committee, says the government is making a mistake by relying on walls to deal with future floods. He believes Bangkok should be downsized and government offices should be relocated to higher ground. &quot;People should not fight with the water. They should let it through. That is how we dealt with floods in the past. That is why Bangkok has so many canals. But now rich city dwellers are too distant from nature. What they are doing with their flood protection walls is actually increasing the level of the water.&quot; Tension rose along with the water. Amid rumours that powerful politicians protected their own constituencies at the expense of neighbouring districts, several deluged communities turned to protest. The most dramatic demonstration occurred at Yucharoen village near Don Mueng airport, where local residents furiously tore down a wall of sandbags. &quot;I was angry because the government did not help us until we protested,&quot; said Pattanan Thongsawad, who was among the demonstrators. &quot;I wasn&apos;t thinking about fairness. I was only thinking about the people who were suffering.&quot; A water mark is still visible in every home in the neighbourhood. Thongsawad said the village must prepare for similar disasters. &quot;We want more concrete walls all the way around our community. That is the only way I&apos;ll feel secure. There will be more rain and more floods and we cannot rely on the government to deal with them.&quot; With politics and climate both looking increasingly unpredictable, many now want more help but do not expect it. &quot;If it comes again, there is nothing we can do,&quot; said Sriburanasorn of Hana. &quot;If every factory had to build its own flood defences, we wouldn&apos;t be able to afford to stay in business. The government must do it do restore confidence \u2026 I never want to go through that again.&quot; Additional reporting by Sunisa Pui", "publicationDate": "2011-12-26T15:02:43Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Flooding", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Environment", "Cities"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/26/thailand-flood-plan", "title": "Thailand seeks flood prevention plan as Bangkok clean-up operation continues", "sentences": ["Now the car parks have been cleared of crocodiles and the store room emptied of cobras, the managers at one of Thailand&apos;s biggest electronics companies have begun reclaiming their factory from Bangkok&apos;s worst flood in a century and wondering what more they can do to prevent the climate wreaking similar havoc in the future.", "As we see rising temperatures, more rain and a higher sea level, Bangkok will be very vulnerable,&quot; said Seree Supratid, a professor at Rangsit University and government adviser.", "We should shift the emphasis from mitigation to adaptation.&quot; Almost five months have passed since the flooding began in the northern hills of Thailand and then spread slowly down through the central plains to inundate swaths of Bangkok, killing more than 500 people, affecting 12 million others and disrupting business at some of the planet&apos;s biggest industrial parks.", "On Buddhamonthon Road in West Bangkok, people were camping on bridges with their belongings stacked under tarpaulin.", "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says Bangkok is one of the most vulnerable cities in the world because it sits on a flood plain and has been periodically inundated for centuries.", "As the water surged southward, Bangkok found itself more vulnerable than in the past because hundreds of its canals have been blocked up over decades of poorly regulated development.", "&quot;The difficulty of projecting droughts and floods will increase for sure,&quot; said Gernot Laganda, a climate specialist at the United Nations Development Program office in Bangkok.", "The Bangkok governor, Sukhumbhand Paribatra, said the city needed to learn from the disaster.", "He believes Bangkok should be downsized and government offices should be relocated to higher ground.", "That is why Bangkok has so many canals."]}, {"article": "It wasn&apos;t the sight of a double-decker bus ablaze on Tottenham High Road that stunned Britain as it awoke one morning in August. It wasn&apos;t even the historic building smouldering in ruins, or the trail of burnt-out police cars. What chilled the country turning on the news that summer Sunday was footage of a young woman calmly trying on trainers before looting them while police stood by helplessly and watched. As night fell, violence spread across the capital as mobs of masked youths hurled missiles at riot police and ransacked shops, making off with trolley-loads of TVs, clothes, jewellery, groceries, even nappies. In growing disbelief, the country watched looting break out in broad daylight; shop owners across London frantically boarded up and fled, but by nightfall Croydon looked like a scene from the Blitz and the Sony factory in Enfield was a blazing inferno. Fire crews stood impotent in the face of jeering mobs, journalists were beaten, press cameras stolen, even leafy Ealing and yuppie Clapham weren&apos;t safe as looters rampaged through department stores. As the contagion spread to Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool, cities that only days earlier had looked perfectly normal teetered on the brink of anarchy. It took four days to restore order, but the legacy of those days will dominate conversation for years to come. Chaotic night courts hastily convened to process the first arrests, which have now exceeded 3,000, saw judges handing down sentences almost as shocking as the riots themselves. One looter was convicted of stealing a lick of ice-cream; he&apos;d walked into a\u00a0patisserie, helped himself to a scoop, but didn&apos;t like the flavour so handed the cone to a woman \u2013\u00a0and was jailed for 16 months. Another got six months for stealing bottled water worth \u00a33.50. Court reports began to read like scenes from a Victorian novel \u2013 though deportation to Australia would probably have been too good for the &quot;feral rats&quot; in the eyes of the tabloids, whose front pages screamed Shop A Looter! Police expect arrests to reach 12,000 by next summer, as officers scan through 200,000 hours of CCTV footage, but the debate about what happened, and why, will go on even longer. &quot;Sheer criminality&quot;, denounced the home secretary, displaying an interesting grasp of nuance. &quot;Parts of our society,&quot; David Cameron declared, &quot;are not broken but sick&quot; \u2013 an unfortunate choice of words, given that in street slang used by the very parts he was talking about, &quot;sick&quot; is the highest form of compliment. Others blamed the police, whose fatal shooting of a father of four in Tottenham ignited the violence. Or was it down to the cuts? Gangs? Twitter? For some it was nothing more than outright greed \u2013 or, as one commentator put it, &quot;just a form of late-night shopping where you don&apos;t have to pay&quot;. Another pundit&apos;s dismay revealed less about the lawlessness of the rioters than the ignorance of the commentariat, when he expressed bewilderment at their unaccountable lack of concern about &quot;promoting the global brand of London in the runup to the 2012 Olympics&quot; \u2013 as if hoodies on Hackney estates speak of nothing but. If there was any early political consensus, it was that the riots were &quot;nonpolitical&quot;. For Labour this was disappointing, even embarrassing \u2013 for how could brazen theft be a legitimate protest? \u2013 while to the Tories it was proof that they couldn&apos;t be to blame. But what could be more political than a\u00a0generation deprived even of political consciousness, knowing only frustrated consumerism, and believing power lies not in Downing Street but JD Sports? &quot;People that have got nothing,&quot; offered one looter, &quot;wanted to show they had nothing.&quot; But from painstaking analysis, a more complex set of motivations slowly began to emerge. &quot;I\u00a0thought, wow, like, there&apos;s actually a force against the government,&quot; said another rioter. &quot;To put the riots into perspective, I thought of it as a\u00a0war between the youth and the government, police.&quot; For many who took to the streets this summer, it\u00a0was a war against a political and economic system that was no longer working. Five people lost their lives in the four days when Britain lost control. Hundreds have since lost their liberty. Livelihoods and homes were lost, the financial losses will run into hundreds of\u00a0millions, and the loss of faith in each other is unquantifiable. A harbinger of global breakdown on an epic scale, the riots turned out to be just one ripple in a devastating storm that swept across the world, making 2011 a year of incalculable loss. The young Tunisian fruit seller who set himself on fire last December could never have imagined what the flames would spark. Within a month, President Ben Ali&apos;s 24-year dictatorship was over. Weeks later, the government of Jordan had gone, too \u2013 and the Arab spring had only just begun.     The bloodied corpse of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi seen in an image taken from video footage, 20\u00a0October.  Photograph: Esam Al-Fetori/Reuters    The Egyptians filling Cairo&apos;s Tahrir Square quickly grew into an unstoppable human tide, and by February President Mubarak&apos;s 30-year reign was over. If he&apos;d hoped to save himself with his parting message to the nation \u2013 &quot;I am proud of you as the new Egyptian generation calling for a\u00a0change to the better, dreaming and making the future&quot; \u2013 he clearly didn&apos;t know his own people very well, for he was promptly detained, fined $33.6m and charged with murder. And still the Arab spring was yet to claim its greatest prize. For 42 years, the mad dog of Libya had tyrannised his own people, terrorised the west \u2013 and still managed to wind up as Tony Blair&apos;s new best friend. Successful dictators cultivate a myth of invincibility around them, until the point where defeat becomes literally unimaginable and the myth becomes truth. Colonel Gaddafi passed that point so long ago that when rebels first seized Benghazi, and the UN authorised Nato air support, some feared we were entangling ourselves in a war that would be open-ended at best, and at worst unwinnable. Even when Tripoli fell in August to the rebels \u2013 a raggle-taggle amateur army in battered pick-up trucks \u2013 still Gaddafi survived, slipping away to a concrete drainpipe hideaway. When rebels finally dragged him out and shot him, footage of Gaddafi&apos;s grisly end caused some unease in the west, but for Libyans it was proof of the impossible, and when a postmortem revealed their former tyrant wore a toupee, few could begrudge them the mocking hilarity of Gaddafi&apos;s Wizard of Oz moment. But what did the Arab spring mean? And where will it lead? Uprisings in Algeria, Bahrain, Morocco and Oman were crushed, but in Yemen the world&apos;s longest reign of a non-royal head of state finally came to an end in late November. By\u00a0then Egyptians had lost faith in their ruling military council&apos;s commitment to democracy, their suspicions confirmed when fresh protests in\u00a0Tahrir Square were attacked with tear gas and brutal beatings. In an echo of Mubarak&apos;s parting speech, the military issued a statement via Facebook offering &quot;regrets and deep apologies for the deaths of martyrs from among Egypt&apos;s loyal sons during the recent events in Tahrir Square&quot;. The likelihood of Egyptians taking this sentiment any more seriously than they did Mubarak&apos;s must be remote, and the victors of early elections were the Muslim Brotherhood. Meanwhile, popular protests in Syria, which began in January, were spiralling into civil war. With more than 5,000 lives lost, protesters&apos; banners pleaded, &quot;If we don&apos;t have oil like Libya and Iraq, don&apos;t we deserve to live?&quot; If any country encapsulated western ambivalence about the Arab spring, it was Syria, whose strategic value was embarrassingly exposed by a gushing American Vogue profile in February of President Assad&apos;s wife, praising the &quot;democracy&quot; in the household of this &quot;rose of the desert&quot;.     A portrait of Greek prime minister George Papandreou as a clown is hung from a noose in Athens during a rally against a new austerity package, 2\u00a0June. Photograph:  /John Kolesidis/Reuters    &quot;Arab spring? This is turning into the winter of jihad,&quot; shrieked the Daily Mail by November. The old dictators might have been monstrous tyrants \u2013 but at least they weren&apos;t Islamist fanatics \u2013 and\u00a0democracy is all very well in the west, but what if Arabs get the vote and elect a bunch of fundamentalists? Seldom has the tension between democratic principle and realpolitik been tested so publicly. But if the Middle East&apos;s old guard were feeling the pressure, it was as nothing compared with the crises gripping Europe. In the course of a single year, the governments of Ireland, Portugal, Greece, Italy and Spain all collapsed under the weight of sovereign debt. The Celtic tiger was the first to be exposed as an optical illusion \u2013 and in February the Fianna F\u00e1il party, which had dominated national politics for 70 years, wasn&apos;t just voted out of office but off the political map. Portugal&apos;s prime minister was the next to go in March, but it was the violence paralysing Athens that lurched Europe from drama into crisis. Tear gas and riot police were no match for the fury of Greeks facing financial ruin, but prime minister Papandreou&apos;s promises of yet more austerity were no match for the markets either, and his kamikaze bid to square the circle with a referendum he&apos;d failed to mention even to his own cabinet proved the final straw, making him the first European leader to be replaced by a\u00a0technocrat \u2013 but not the last. Silvio Berlusconi&apos;s mind began the year on matters much closer to home. The man who once described himself as &quot;the Jesus Christ of politics&quot; was facing trials for corruption and sex with an under-age prostitute, but it wasn&apos;t bunga bunga parties but Italy&apos;s bank balance he should have been worrying about. As late as November, Berlusconi was blithely insisting &quot;our restaurants are full of people&quot;, but the markets could no longer be fooled, and eight days later he, too, was gone, replaced by another technocrat ex-banker. A week later, Spain&apos;s government fell as well, leaving Europe&apos;s leaders staring into the abyss. Would the euro survive? Would the EU survive? Did we need closer fiscal integration \u2013 a two-speed Europe? Repatriation of powers? Summit after summit produced little more than alarming proof that nobody had a clue. Half-forgotten political forces rose phoenix-like from the crisis \u2013 first the unions, launching their biggest strike in a\u00a0generation, and then the Tory Eurosceptics, for whom Christmas came early when a government containing the most pro-European party in parliament stunned the country by exiling Britain into a minority of one in Brussels. Were we\u00a0witnessing our exit from the European dream, or jumping from a sinking ship? The only certainty to emerge from the turmoil engulfing the continent was, in the words of one columnist, that, &quot;The grown-ups are not in charge.&quot; So who is? The answer, we discovered this year, is the markets \u2013 and for one very simple reason. People lose power when they run out of money, and in 2011 we didn&apos;t just lose a lot of money, but\u00a0faith in our entire way of life. In the words of Mervyn King, we reached &quot;an extraordinarily serious&quot; and &quot;exceptionally threatening environment&quot; that could spiral into a &quot;systemic financial crisis&quot;. Richard Branson put it more simply: capitalism has &quot;lost its way&quot;. If hundreds of billions-worth of bailouts haven&apos;t saved the eurozone, what hope have ordinary British families of surviving the meltdown? While global stock markets plunged into freefall, one in four of us were struggling to pay our fuel bills, as wage cuts and inflation saw living standards plummet. By 2013, predicted the Institute for Fiscal Studies, cuts will have condemned more than 3 million children to poverty and caused the sharpest fall in average incomes in 35 years. Unemployment passed 2.5 million, on its inexorable rise to the highest level in 17 years. By the end of the year, more than 1 million young people were out of work, each one a casualty of an economic catastrophe that began in Wall Street boardrooms and has reached the bedrooms of British teenagers. But unless the chancellor decides he might have a Plan B after all, more of us will be out of a job next year. Most will be women, and if Cameron hopes to stop losing any more of their votes, he probably shouldn&apos;t suggest they, &quot;Calm down, dear.&quot; The economy wasn&apos;t to blame for every job loss this year, though. Richard Keys and Andy Gray had only their Neanderthal sexism to blame for losing their jobs at Sky \u2013 though the pair looked like monks compared with Dominique Strauss-Kahn, whose arrest for rape in a Manhattan hotel bathroom (a charge that was later dropped) prompted a flood of sexual allegations, and a sudden vacancy at the IMF. Drunken fumblings with an old flame, weeks after his wedding to the Queen&apos;s granddaughter, lost Mike Tindall his place in the English rugby squad \u2013 the second royal embarrassment of the year, after Prince Andrew&apos;s friendship with a convicted sex offender cost him his job as UK trade envoy. There was little sympathy for John Galliano when his antisemitic outburst in a Paris bar (&quot;I love Hitler&quot;) sent him packing from Dior and into court \u2013 and even less for the staff of a Bristol care home, sacked after an undercover Panorama reporter revealed grotesque abuse.

Photograph: PA Wire    Defence secretary Liam Fox could presumably rely upon the sympathy of friends when he lost his job in October \u2013 for we&apos;d discovered just how close he likes to keep his friends, after Adam Werrity kept popping up beside him all over the world. Cheryl Cole was perhaps alone in taking no public blame when US X Factor dumped our Geordie sweetheart only weeks into the job, claiming audiences simply wouldn&apos;t understand a\u00a0word she said. After losing more than 3 million viewers, the UK&apos;s X Factor judges may well be out of a job themselves next year. In Russia, Vladimir Putin&apos;s party held on to its parliamentary majority, but mass protests against election-rigging suggested the Kremlin&apos;s great survivor might be losing his grip. In the US, a comical string of politicians managed to lose a job before coming close to even landing it. Michelle Bachmann&apos;s presidential campaign was the first to implode, undermined by puzzling statements such as her claim that the cervical cancer vaccine causes &quot;mental retardation&quot;, swiftly followed by Rick Perry&apos;s, when he couldn&apos;t remember which government agencies he was campaigning to close. A pizza magnate raised fleeting Republican hopes before being accused of sexual harassment and displaying a mastery of foreign policy that made Sarah Palin look like Henry Kissinger. Asked if he supported Obama on Libya, Herman Cain searched his mind for nine toe-curling seconds before coming out with, &quot;President Obama supported the uprising. Correct?&quot; plunging the party&apos;s search for a plausible candidate into such disarray that Newt Gingrich \u2013 that champion of down-home family values currently on his third wife, 27 years his junior, for whom he keeps a $500,000 credit line open at Tiffany \u2013 is back in the race. Such is the Tea Party&apos;s panic at the prospect of a Mormon candidate, Mitt Romney, any day now Cheryl Cole may be getting a call. But the year&apos;s most sensational string of job losses began with a single resignation. When Andy Coulson stood down as Cameron&apos;s official spokesman in January, who could have dreamed he&apos;d be followed by Rebekah Brooks, Les Hinton, Sir Paul Stephenson, John Yates, Baroness Buscombe and not only the entire staff of the News Of The World but the 168-year-old newspaper itself? For a few heady weeks in July, we watched in amazement as fortress Wapping began to collapse like a house of cards, Rupert and James Murdoch reduced from figures of fear to mockery, as they sat before a select committee like a doddery old man and a naughty schoolboy who hadn&apos;t done his homework. &quot;You must be,&quot; sneered Tom Watson MP, &quot;the first mafia boss in history to not know he was running a criminal enterprise.&quot; The fate of the Murdochs and their empire remains an open question, and by the time the Leveson inquiry has completed its investigation next year, what will be left of the British media as we know it is anyone&apos;s guess. Four ex-MPs and two lords were jailed for expenses fraud, followed in October by three of Pakistan&apos;s Test cricketers for spot-fixing, along with several student protesters for their part in last year&apos;s tuition fee riots. Julian Assange&apos;s confinement was more comfortable, spending the year under house arrest in a stately home, but the WikiLeaks chief&apos;s fight against extradition to Sweden on rape charges was finally lost, barring a\u00a0final appeal to the supreme court next year. In November, Shelter warned that 35,000 people \u2013 two every second \u2013 were at risk of losing their home before the end of the year through repossessions and rent rises. If Eric Pickles was right in his letter to Cameron, leaked in July, another 40,000 may be made homeless by\u00a0the new housing benefit cap \u2013 and if Boris Johnson has his way, so will the &quot;bivouacked crusties&quot; and &quot;fornicating hippies&quot; whose new canvas homes were &quot;erupting like boils&quot; in London this autumn. &quot;We are the 99%&quot; declared the Occupy Wall Street movement as it pitched camp in New York in September. Anti-capitalism camps began appearing on every continent, but the tents that quickly pitched outside St Paul&apos;s in London proved more of an immediate problem for the church than the City. After three clerics had resigned, the cathedral withdrew its support for eviction, and the camp&apos;s future now lies with the courts. Homes, liberty, jobs, power, money \u2013 all were lost in 2011, but still eclipsed by the year&apos;s loss of\u00a0life. The earthquake and tsunami that shattered Japan in March killed 18,000 and left swathes of the country looking like old footage of\u00a0Hiroshima. The legacy of damage to the Fukushima nuclear plant still isn&apos;t known, but the\u00a0death toll from earthquakes in New Zealand and\u00a0Turkey was heartbreakingly instant, wiping out 1,000 lives. A year that began with apocalyptic floods in Brazil saw the suburbs of Bangkok underwater by\u00a0the autumn, but these were natural disasters of an ominously unnatural kind. Drought in east Africa has starved and displaced hundreds of thousands, Hurricane Irene tore through the Americas in August, February&apos;s cyclone in Queensland left much of the state looking more like Venice than Australia \u2013 and that was only some of the world&apos;s extreme weather. November&apos;s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report confirmed only what we already feared: this wasn&apos;t bad luck, but proof we are losing the fight against climate change. The deal struck in Durban a month later was, despaired Friends of the Earth, an &quot;empty shell of a plan&quot; that leaves the planet &quot;hurtling towards catastrophic climate change&quot;. Nothing will ever fully explain why Anders Breivik woke up one morning in July and set off a\u00a0bomb in Oslo killing eight, before moving on to a political youth summer camp on the picturesque island of Ut\u00f8ya, where the 32-year-old Christian laughed and cheered as he calmly gunned down 69 teenagers. Less astonishing was the death that same month of Amy Winehouse. The only real surprise was the autopsy report, which found no illegal drugs in the 27-year-old singer&apos;s system. After all the crack and cocaine, the drug that killed her was alcohol. &quot;I think,&quot; her mother wept, &quot;Amy thought she was invincible.&quot; For Apple fans mourning the loss of Steve Jobs to cancer in October, their hero wasn&apos;t just a techie rock star but a saint, honoured with shrines of apples outside Apple stores across the world. In\u00a0the year of the iPhone 4, Ofcom declared us &quot;addicted to smart phones&quot;, but even Jobs was no \u00a0rival for the year&apos;s most iconic death.     Royal wedding well-wishers behind a line\u00a0of\u00a0police near Buckingham Palace. Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images    &quot;We got him,&quot; may be the sweetest three words President Obama has heard since entering the White House, relayed to a tense situation room early on May 2 by US special forces who had stormed a plain-looking house in a quiet Pakistani garrison town, and shot dead the world&apos;s most wanted man, Osama bin Laden. But\u00a0British bodies kept on coming home from Afghanistan, averaging one a week in a year that\u00a0saw the 10th anniversary of 9/11, but still no\u00a0end to the decade-long war. Last month, the football world was shocked by the news that Welsh manager Gary Speed had killed himself, but most of the year&apos;s sporting losses were not tragic so much as farcical. England\u00a0didn&apos;t even reach the rugby World Cup semi-finals, with one player&apos;s lament as he left the field \u2013 &quot;There&apos;s \u00a335,000 down the toilet&quot; \u2013 confirming suspicions that the squad cared more for money than for their country. Andy Murray lost his third grand slam final, and most of us lost out on our bid for Olympics tickets, in an application process that made a papal election look straightforward. Ryan Giggs&apos;s 20-year career at Old Trafford looked in danger of ending in tacky disgrace, when the footballer&apos;s superinjunction gagging an alleged affair with a model became the talk of Twitter \u2013 and when Manchester United lost 1-6 to Manchester City in October, Alex Ferguson&apos;s reign seemed to be ebbing away. When both teams tumbled out of the Champions League at the group stages, the Premiership&apos;s dominance of European football began to look as doubtful as Britain&apos;s place in European politics. Who, then, were the year&apos;s winners? The royal family was generally agreed to have pulled off a good wedding, though the real sensation was the derriere of the bride&apos;s sister following Prince William and Kate Middleton up the aisle. Amanda Knox walked free from an Italian prison, and the Scottish National party achieved a historic outright majority, though one that leaves Alex Salmond with a tricky obligation to hold an independence referendum few think he can win. If anyone could claim to have had the time of their life in 2011, it\u00a0was the cast of The Only Way Is Essex, whose vajazzled bling became the year&apos;s inexplicable hit. Royal weddings and reality TV left an unnerving whiff of decadent decay lingering over the remains of the year. &quot;No country, or group of countries, stays on top for ever,&quot; observed the Economist. &quot;People who grew up in America and western Europe have become used to the idea that the west dominates the world economy. In\u00a0fact, it is anomalous that a group of 30-odd countries with a small fraction of the world&apos;s population should be calling the shots.&quot; We will remember 2011 for all that was lost \u2013 but for the east, it may be the year their century began.", "publicationDate": "2011-12-30T22:59:00Z", "tags": ["UK news", "World news", "Television", "Science", "Culture", "Internet", "Technology", "Social media", "Digital media", "Media", "Sport", "Fashion", "Life and style", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Art and design", "Food & drink", "Television industry"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/30/2011-end-of-year-review", "title": "2011: the year in review", "sentences": ["A year that began with apocalyptic floods in Brazil saw the suburbs of Bangkok underwater by\u00a0the autumn, but these were natural disasters of an ominously unnatural kind."]}, {"article": "Knights Bachelor Professor Brian Mellor Greenwood, CBE, Professor, Clinical Tropical Medicine, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
