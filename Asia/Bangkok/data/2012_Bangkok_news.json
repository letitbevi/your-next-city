We went on a cold, rainy night. The front entrance is surrounded by oppressive concrete blocks and iron grilles, but once in, the underground lair is warm and inviting, and an actual former bunker, with low curving ceilings creating a higgledy-piggledy array of nooks and crannies tumbling away from the central room and bar used for the live shows. It was sweaty, claustrophobic, edgy and a great place to jump around to bands, DJs and music I&apos;d not heard before. Rosenplatz 7, +49 371 519949 laurence5000 Thailand     Sirocco bar, Bangkok.

At seven o&apos;clock a car drew up at the pillared portico of the British ambassador&apos;s residence in the centre of the bustling, ramshackle city of Rangoon and &quot;the lady&quot;, as she is known to all in Burma, stepped out. William Hague, who had been shuffling his feet slightly nervously, stepped forward. &quot;Welcome,&quot; said the first British foreign secretary to visit Burma since 1955, though this in every way is her city and her country. Aung San Suu Kyi is much sought after these days. After spending most of the past 23 years in prison or under house arrest, her diary is very full. She passed the morning at the cramped headquarters of her National League for Democracy party, seeing, in succession, its senior executive, a deputation of families of political prisoners and the leader of another pro-democracy group. After the domestic came the international: three global television networks and Hague. The intervening years have been dark for Aung San Suu Kyi and the country. In 1962, when she was 17 years old, the military seized power and have held it ever since. In 1988, as the daughter of the country&apos;s most famous freedom fighter, she became the public face of popular protests against the repressive regime. Thousands were killed in a crackdown, Aung San Suu Kyi was confined to her home and the elections in 1990, won by the NLD, were cancelled. The isolation of Burma deepened. Now, although US and European Union sanctions are still in place, that isolation is ending. A nominally civilian government has been appointed. An election, though deeply flawed, has been held and Aung San Suu Kyi released from house arrest. The president&apos;s political adviser, Nay Zinn Latt, told the Guardian that one day the NLD could be &quot;the ruling party&quot;, one of the most outspoken declarations of change in the still secretive and repressive state so far. Earlier in the day Hague, flying in from Bangkok, met the president, Thein Sein, in the new capital of Naypyidaw, hacked out of swamp and scrub at enormous expense over the past decade. A statement released in London said that, during their talk, Hague had emphasised &quot;the importance the British government attaches to the reforms that the Burmese government has undertaken in the last six months&quot;. These reforms have seen censorship eased, new labour laws passed and a new willingness to find an accommodation with ethnic minorities. But confusion following Hague&apos;s meeting with the Burmese foreign minister underlined just how tentative these changes are. Hague was reported as saying that he had been assured by his Burmese counterpart that the political prisoners held in horrific conditions in the country would be freed. However, in an interview with the BBC Burmese service, foreign secretary Wunna Maung Lwi said there were only &quot;criminals&quot; in Burmese jails. The issue is a deeply emotive one in Rangoon. Between 600 and 1,700 political prisoners are thought to be jailed and the most recent crackdown, following the Saffron Revolution in 2007, saw hundreds handed sentences of up to 65 years. Wa Wa Win remembers the knock at midnight from the police and military intelligence when they came to take her husband, Pyone Cho, away. An activist since 1988, he had first been detained within months of their marriage and spent six years in jail. Arrested again four years ago, and given an effective life sentence in a show trial, he is now held in the distant town of Kaunt Thang. To see her husband for 30 minutes, Wa Wa Win, 46, travels for six days. Occasionally she receives a letter. &quot;I would love to see my husband released but I am not hoping for anything,&quot; she said. The issue is a problem for Aung San Suu Kyi, too. On Thursday she described President Thein Sein \u2013 appointed by the elderly military dictator, Than Shwe, in March 2010 to lead the nominally civilian government and a transition to democracy \u2013 as &quot;an honest man \u2026 a man capable of taking risks if he thinks they are worth taking&quot;. But there was widespread disappointment at the limited extent of an amnesty to mark the anniversary of Burmese independence from British imperial rule earlier this week. Only 10 political prisoners were freed, all serving short sentences. &quot;We cannot say there is any change. We can just glimpse some kind of road ahead, but we are still at the starting point,&quot; said Kokoji, an activist and former prisoner. &quot;As long as there are still political prisoners, abuses, civil war and land grabs, you cannot talk of change.&quot; Aung San Suu Kyi herself said she was worried about &quot;how much support there is in the military for changes&quot;, admitting that reforms were not &quot;unstoppable&quot;. Yet change is coming to Burma, whatever the military wants. Earlier this week, activists organised a film festival in a shopping mall in the centre of Rangoon. So many people turned up that a screen was set up on the street outside. The crowd gasped and clapped as they watched images of the 2007 uprising and police brutality as well as footage of ethnic minorities battling the feared Burmese army. &quot;There should be more and more events like this,&quot; said Ko Han, a 43-year-old trader who had been passing with his wife and daughter. &quot;This means people get informed. If there is only a very little bit we can still say there is change.&quot; Ko Han welcomed Hague&apos;s visit as &quot;it will mean more pressure&quot; on the &quot;half-military government&quot;, as he called it. And Aung San Suu Kyi? &quot;The lady has sacrificed so much for our country. She is our leader.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-01-05T19:46:51Z", "tags": ["Aung San Suu Kyi", "William Hague", "World news", "Politics", "Foreign policy", "UK news", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/05/aung-sun-suu-kyi-william-hague-burma", "title": "A moment in history as Hague meets 'the lady' of Burma", "sentences": ["Earlier in the day Hague, flying in from Bangkok, met the president, Thein Sein, in the new capital of Naypyidaw, hacked out of swamp and scrub at enormous expense over the past decade."]}, {"article": "If you want a bargain flight, it&apos;s almost always better to book as far ahead as possible.

The announcement came as police and the director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute any individual MI5 or MI6 officers following lengthy investigations into allegations of British complicity in the torture of terrorism suspects in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The new investigation is to focus on Abdul Hakim Belhaj and Sami al-Saadi, who lodged complaints with the police last November after the chance discovery of a cache of classified documents in an abandoned Libyan government office laid bare the role that MI6 played in their rendition. Saadi was detained in Hong Kong in 2004 and then forced on to a plane to Tripoli with his wife and four children in an operation that MI6 mounted in co-operation with Gaddafi&apos;s intelligence chief, Moussa Koussa. Saadi says he suffered years of torture. Belhaj was detained in Bangkok along with his pregnant wife after an MI6 tip-off, and allegedly tortured by American agents for several days before being flown to Tripoli where he says he was tortured and detained for several years. His wife, who was detained for several months, has not spoken publicly about the manner in which she was treated. British officials have not sought to deny the involvement of MI6 in either rendition. Instead, they have stressed that each resulted from what they describe as &quot;ministerially authorised government policy&quot;, raising the possibility that the new Yard inquiry will require the questioning of ministers of the last Labour government. In addition, the police and the Crown Prosecution Service announced that they were establishing a joint panel that would examine other allegations of UK complicity in torture and rendition levelled by a number of former Guant\u00e1namo inmates and others detained in the so-called war on terror. These complainants include Shaker Aamer, the last British resident still held at Guant\u00e1namo. The panel will decide whether the allegations should be examined first by the official inquiry that was established by David Cameron 18 months ago, and which is waiting to start hearing evidence, or whether police should investigate immediately. A statement issued on Thursday by Starmer and Lynne Owens, an assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan police, said the panel would consider &quot;whether there is any significant risk that any available evidence would not be available or would be weakened&quot; if an investigation did not take place immediately, or whether &quot;the allegation in question is so serious that it is in the public interest to investigate it now&quot;. This panel advised on the Libyan cases, and the police decided that &quot;the allegations raised in the two specific cases concerning the alleged rendition of named individuals to Libya and the alleged ill-treatment of them in Libya are so serious that it is in the public interest for them to be investigated now rather than at the conclusion of the detainee inquiry&quot;. Scotland Yard detectives have spent 30 months investigating allegations that the UK&apos;s intelligence agencies had become so close to the torture inflicted by overseas governments that their officers had committed serious criminal offences. One inquiry, codenamed Operation Hinton, focused on the events surrounding MI5&apos;s interrogation of Binyam Mohamed in May 2002, several weeks after he had been detained in Pakistan, and later events in Morocco. Proceedings brought on Mohamed&apos;s behalf showed that MI5 knew he was being mistreated before an officer was sent to Karachi to question him. The CPS decided more than a year ago that that officer \u2013 identified only as Witness B \u2013 should not face charges, but Operation Hinton continued while detectives pursued what Starmer described as a &quot;wider investigation into other potential criminal conduct&quot;. This involved attempting to trace responsibility for Witness B&apos;s actions up MI5&apos;s chain of command and beyond. The investigation showed that &quot;members of the Security Service provided information to the US authorities about Mr Mohamed and supplied questions for the US authorities to put to Mr Mohamed while he was being detained between 2002 and 2004&quot;, the statement said. However, the CPS has also concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute any individual on the basis that they &quot;knew or ought to have known that there was a real or serious risk that Mr Mohamed would be exposed to ill treatment amounting to torture&quot;. The statement added: &quot;Nothing in this decision should be read as concluding that the ill-treatment alleged by Mr Mohamed did not take place or that it was lawful.&quot; A second investigation, codenamed Operation Iden, concentrated on events in 2002 at Bagram airfield north of Kabul, where the US military had established a prison, and where both MI5 and MI6 officers interrogated a number of suspects after being given written instruction from London that &quot;the law does not require you to intervene to prevent&quot; the mistreatment they were witnessing. That investigation was triggered after MI6 referred one of its own officers to the attorney general in September 2009. &quot;The offences considered were aiding and abetting torture, aiding and abetting war crimes, false imprisonment, aiding and abetting assault, and misconduct in public office,&quot; the statement said. That investigation foundered on unsuccessful attempts to take a statement from a particular individual who was said to have been mistreated in the presence of an MI6 interrogator. It is thought that this was because it was not possible to be certain about the identity of the individual. In addition, US officials who were thought to have been present refused to be interviewed by police. &quot;On the account that has been given by the member of the Secret Intelligence Services and taking into account all other available evidence, there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of convicting him of any criminal offence,&quot; the statement concluded. It is unclear when the official inquiry, chaired by Sir Peter Gibson, a former appeal court judge, will begin hearing evidence. In a statement on Thursday, the inquiry panel said: &quot;The detainee inquiry panel will now carefully consider its next steps and Sir Peter Gibson will make an announcement in due course.&quot; Most major human rights groups are boycotting the inquiry, claiming that it will be too secretive and is insufficiently independent of government, but the Foreign Office is mounting a renewed effort to persuade them back on board. The head of MI6, Sir John Sawers, said he welcomed the decision not to charge any of his officers at the conclusion of the twin investigations and said that the &quot;courageous individual&quot; at the centre of Operation Iden would now be able to continue his work in support of national security. He added that MI6 would co-operate with the Libyan investigations. &quot;It is in the service&apos;s interest to deal with the allegations being made as swiftly as possible so we can draw a line under them and focus on the crucial work we now face in the future.&quot; Detectives are thought to have already begun examining the documentation that was uncovered in Tripoli last month by an investigator with Human Rights Watch, the New York-based NGO. The documents will also form the basis of civil claims that Saadi and Belhaj and their families are bringing against the British government. It is not yet clear which ministers may have authorised the secret Libyan rendition operations in the way that well-placed Whitehall sources have asserted. After the documents were discovered, Tony Blair, who was prime minister at the time, insisted he knew nothing about them. Similarly, Jack Straw, who was then foreign secretary, said in a radio interview: &quot;The position of successive foreign secretaries, including me, is that we were opposed to unlawful rendition, opposed to torture or similar methods and not only did we not agree with it, we were not complicit in it, nor did we turn a blind eye to it.&quot; He added: &quot;No foreign secretary can know all the details of what \u2026 intelligence services are doing at any one time.&quot; Shortly after Blair and Straw issued their denials, Sir Richard Dearlove, who was head of MI6 at the time, said: &quot;It was a political decision, having very significantly disarmed Libya, for the government to co-operate with Libya on Islamist terrorism. The whole relationship was one of serious calculation about where the overall balance of our national interests stood.&quot; The year after the joint UK-Libyan operations were mounted, Straw told MPs they must disbelieve allegations of UK involvement in rendition &quot;unless we all start to believe in conspiracy theories and that the officials are lying, that I am lying, that behind this there is some kind of secret state which is in league with some dark forces in the United States&quot;. Asked following Dearlove&apos;s statement whether he still maintained that he was unaware of the Libyan rendition operations, and whether he knew which ministers Dearlove could be referring to, Straw said he had no further comment to make. Blair also declined to make any further comment.", "publicationDate": "2012-01-12T14:16:00Z", "tags": ["Foreign policy", "Afghanistan", "Rendition", "MI6", "MI5", "World news", "Torture", "UK news", "Libya", "Law", "Moussa Koussa", "Politics", "Defence policy", "Pakistan"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/12/libya-rendition-torture-abduction-mi6", "title": "Police to investigate MI6 over rendition and torture of Libyans", "sentences": ["Belhaj was detained in Bangkok along with his pregnant wife after an MI6 tip-off, and allegedly tortured by American agents for several days before being flown to Tripoli where he says he was tortured and detained for several years."]}, {"article": "     Police in Thailand are questioning a suspected Hezbollah member, with the development coming as the US embassy warned American nationals of the threat of a terrorist attack in the country. The suspected Hezbollah member, a Lebanese man, was arrested on Thursday after a tipoff from Israel about a potential attack in Bangkok, the Thai deputy prime minister, Chalerm Yoobamrung, said, adding that police had stepped up security. Chalerm told Reuters: &quot;A Lebanese suspect from the Hezbollah group has been taken into custody by Thai officials and police are investigating further. &quot;Following concern raised by the Israeli embassy about a possible attack by a group of Lebanese terrorists in Bangkok, Thai police officials have been co-ordinating with Israeli officials since before the new year.&quot; He said the authorities had been following two Lebanese men, but did not say what had happened to the other, and also suggested that Thailand had no strong evidence linking the men to a planned attack. &quot;Technically, the two men have not committed any crimes under the Thai law, so we could only use the immigration law to keep this one suspect in custody,&quot; he said. On Friday, the US embassy issued an emergency message warning that &quot;foreign terrorists may be currently looking to conduct attacks against tourist areas in Bangkok in the near future. US citizens are urged to exercise caution when visiting public areas where large groups of western tourists gather in Bangkok&quot;. Thailand&apos;s defence minister, Yuthasak Sasiprapha, said: &quot;Thai officials had not intended to release the news at this time, since it could have an impact on tourism and cause panic among citizens.&quot; He added that the US embassy was naturally concerned about its citizens, and said Thai and US intelligence officials were monitoring other individuals. The authorities were applying extra precautionary measures in areas popular with tourists as well as Suvarnabhumi airport in Bangkok, he added. Yuthasak identified the Israeli embassy and synagogues as possible targets, while adding that intelligence reports said the planned attacks might be related to US activities against Iran. Iran has blamed the US and Israel for a series of assassinations of its nuclear scientists, the most recent of which was on Wednesday. According to Iranian news sources, Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan was killed in Tehran when two men on a motorcycle detonated a bomb attached to his car. Hezbollah, a militant Shia Muslim group accused of carrying out terrorist attacks in the Middle East since the 1980s, is backed by Iran and is widely considered to be a proxy for the Tehran regime. Reuters reported a Thai defence ministry source as saying that Israeli intelligence had contacted Thai officials on 22 December with information that two or three suspects could be planning an attack in Thailand. However, the individuals travelled to the south and left the country. On 8 January, the Israelis again warned Thai officials of the danger of an attack between 13 and 15 January in areas where there are often large concentrations of western tourists such as the Khao San Road, which is popular with young backpackers. Thailand is also a popular destination for young Israelis holidaying after completing their military service. Thailand has rarely been a target for foreign terrorists, although domestic militant Muslim groups are engaged in an insurgency in the south and have bombed civilian targets.

The national police chief, General Priewpan Damapong, said the suspected bomb plotters \u2013 two Lebanese men thought to be linked to pro-Iranian Hezbollah militants \u2013 called off the scheme after police caught wind of the plot and arrested one of them on Thursday. Thai police \u2013 who are warning visitors in tourist-heavy areas such as Khao San Road to exercise caution \u2013 believe the suspect is in Bangkok but are also upping security searches in nearby provinces and other popular tourist destinations such as Pattaya and Phuket. Thailand&apos;s metropolitan police spokesman Piya Ayutho said: &quot;From intelligence reports, the attackers will use explosives, so the public is urged to be vigilant in risk areas, or in buildings visited by a lot of foreigners, and to particularly look for vehicles that have been left in certain areas for a long time.&quot; The prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, said she had ordered the Thai army, police and security forces to remain vigilant and inform her of any developments, according to the Bangkok Post.

Anyone who believes they have seen the suspect is urged to report to the nearest police station or call 191 from within Thailand. Priewpan said the man in custody, a Swedish national of Lebanese origin identified as Attiris Hussein, told police an attack had been planned but was called off when police learned about it. Hussein was detained by police on Thursday at Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi international airport while trying to leave the country. Authorities said charges had not been pressed against Hussein because of lack of evidence that he had committed an offence. According to the Bangkok Post, Hussein told Thai officials that although he was a member of Hezbollah, he was not a member of the group&apos;s militant arm. The alleged bomb plot, combined with Hussein&apos;s arrest, caused many foreign embassies, including those of the US, UK and Israel, to issue travel alerts for Thailand, warning that foreign terrorists could be planning to launch attacks in tourist areas in Bangkok in the near future. The US called the threat &quot;Bangkok-specific&quot; and &quot;credible&quot;.

This of course may have nothing to do with box office success \u2013 otherwise The Hangover Part II would win everything in sight, and we would see Bradley Cooper accepting his armful of statuettes and tearfully calling for his cast and crew to join him on stage to celebrate the remarkable creative journey which took them first to Las Vegas and then to Bangkok. Some commentators this morning are saying that Michel Hazanavicius&apos;s glorious silent movie The Artist was the evening&apos;s (and by implication probably the year&apos;s) clear winner with its three awards: best picture and best actor (for Jean Dujardin) in the musical or comedy category and best score. I&apos;m not quite so sure about this. Famously, the Globes distinguishes between drama and comedy or musical, and Alexander Payne&apos;s bittersweet The Descendants has won convincingly in this first category, taking home best picture and best actor for its star, George Clooney, playing a wealthy Hawaii lawyer who must rebuild his relationship with his daughters after discovering that his wife, in a coma after a speedboat accident, was having an affair. The question of what is a &quot;drama&quot; and what is a &quot;comedy&quot; is traditionally highly exasperating at the Golden Globes, although the category-split does at least make reasonably sure that awards do not simply go to the po-faced contenders. I personally would have liked to see The Artist win in the Drama category, thus freeing up the field for Bridesmaids to clean up in the Comedy race. The Artist is fractionally, but I think only fractionally, ahead of The Descendants in the race for which film gets to be the single headline winner of this year&apos;s award season. Cynics can see that both films have that vital upper-middlebrow off-mainstream quality \u2013 a cut above, but not too challengingly difficult \u2013 that can capture the award-voters imagination. The Hollywood award campaign for The Artist has tellingly revealed a good deal about why silence is golden. Uggie, the cute Jack Russell terrier in the movie, has been featured extensively, perhaps exhaustively, on TV chat shows. Why? Because like the two other principals, Jean Dujardin and B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo, he speaks no English, but is at least not expected to. Dujardin has nowhere near enough English to carry a TV interview, so he has been reduced to mugging and doing wacky animal impressions, and there have been rumours that producer Harvey Weinstein is worried that reminders of the film&apos;s Frenchness will be a turn-off. Nonetheless, The Artist may well turn out to be the first French film to win best picture at the Academy Awards, but it will have achieved this triumph by keeping schtum, by being silent and reversing the talkie revolution which famously exposed those with squeaky or funny voices as ineligible for employment in the movie business. If The Descendants really does triumph over The Artist at the Oscars, this would be a tiny bit of a travesty, as it is not as powerful and bold as Payne&apos;s last three films, although it does have some very good moments, chiefly Clooney&apos;s confrontation with his angry and grieving father-in-law, played by Robert Forster (whom I would incidentally like to see in with an Oscar shout for best supporting actor). A stricter justice would surely have given best actor to Michael Fassbender for his leading role in Shame (no ambiguity about whether that film should go in drama or comedy) and though I am a massive fan of Jean Dujardin, part of me would have loved to see the Globe go to Brendan Gleeson for his role in John Michael McDonagh&apos;s superlative black comedy The Guard. As for best actress, Meryl Streep&apos;s stately triumphal process towards the Oscar has now begun. She was a thermo-nuclear powered star turn in The Iron Lady, Phyllida Lloyd&apos;s sympathetic movie portrait of Margaret Thatcher. It is a brilliant performance, no question about it. The film was a classic example of what Variety magazine shrewdly calls the &quot;fourth-quarter biopic&quot;, that is, a biopic released at the very end of the year, in the fourth quarter, right up against the awards season, to maximise its gong-friendliness. Streep&apos;s performance is basically another demonstration of that offensive, non-PC, but brutally accurate maxim about award-winning performances, voiced by Robert Downey Jr&apos;s character in the comedy Tropic Thunder \u2014 the vital importance of going &quot;semi-retard&quot;. Baroness Thatcher is here suffering from dementia, but this involves only picturesque symptoms: gentle, heartbreaking hallucinations about her late husband, vivid flashbacks to her early underdog struggle, defiant assertions of continuing feistiness with doctors and younger politicians. Michelle Williams got the best actress in the comedy or musical category for My Week with Marilyn, and this, too, was a very accomplished, smart, insightful impersonation of Marilyn Monroe. The performance and the film itself had a certain shallow quality which was nonetheless part of its charm: the entertainment that this film delivered is not easy to pull off. Octavia Spencer&apos;s Globe for best supporting actress in The Help will add to the discomfiture of those who see an outrageous condescension in this sugary, sparkly story of how the 1960s US civil rights struggle demonstrated white people&apos;s essential decency. My colleague Xan Brooks has shrewdly commented that liberal reviewers must contend with the undoubted truth that The Help is a very well acted and well directed picture \u2013 I would add that it is handsomely photographed and designed \u2013 and so an acting award is technically merited. But Octavia Spencer is at least arguably the co-star of The Help, alongside Emma Stone, and could have been nominated as a lead, not merely the supporting &quot;help&quot;. Christopher Plummer, at 82 years old, won best supporting actor for Beginners in a very strong field, and it is good to see this vigorous, intelligent performer get the acknowledgement he deserves: somehow he seems, perennially, about 20 years younger than his actual age. It was very gratifying to see the best foreign language Globe go to the Iranian film A Separation, by Asghar Farhadi \u2014 I have elsewhere implied that there is something tiring about the consensus that emerges during an awards race, but it has been very heartening to see this outstanding movie claim hearts and minds so generally. The best director and best screenplay awards honoured two Hollywood masters who are producing what I feel is their second-best work. Martin Scorsese won the directing prize for his family film, Hugo, a lovely-looking movie about Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s and the origins of cinema. It is a heartfelt film, but I couldn&apos;t help feeling that it was a little bit pedagogic, a bit of a history lesson. But there is no doubting the powerful connection it made with audiences, and the movie was admirably un-parochial, looking outside Hollywood to France for cinema&apos;s Book Of Genesis. Woody Allen&apos;s Midnight In Paris also took a sentimental journey to the French capital; Allen&apos;s best film in some years gave him the best screenplay prize: I wouldn&apos;t be at all surprised to see this duplicated at the Oscars. It is, indeed, a very smart screenplay. Since seeing this at Cannes, and again in London for its UK release, I actually found myself seeing Midnight In Paris for a third time recently, with an honest-to-goodness, non-journalist paying audience \u2014 and saw how this film got very big laughs and sent everyone out buzzing with enjoyment. So The Artist is still ahead of the field. But I think it could be a neck-and-neck race between Jean Dujardin in his dinner jacket with his dog under his arm, and George Clooney in his Hawaiian shirt.", "publicationDate": "2012-01-16T08:05:52Z", "tags": ["Golden Globes 2012", "Golden Globes", "Film", "Oscars", "Oscars 2012", "George Clooney", "Meryl Streep", "Woody Allen", "Martin Scorsese", "3D", "Michelle Williams", "Marilyn Monroe", "Cannes film festival", "Cannes 2011", "Awards and prizes", "Harvey Weinstein", "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/16/golden-globes-2012-artist-descendants", "title": "Golden Globes 2012: Is The Artist's awards momentum a dramatic comedy of errors?", "sentences": ["This of course may have nothing to do with box office success \u2013 otherwise The Hangover Part II would win everything in sight, and we would see Bradley Cooper accepting his armful of statuettes and tearfully calling for his cast and crew to join him on stage to celebrate the remarkable creative journey which took them first to Las Vegas and then to Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Sai Thong Resort, Koh Tao While the nearby gulf islands of Samui and Phangan have been long-term draws for beach-loving travellers, the smaller Koh Tao has only recently emerged as one of Thailand&apos;s headline destinations.

In Thailand, where censorship laws are already heavily enforced, the information and communication technology minister, Jeerawan Boonperm, called Twitter&apos;s decision a &quot;welcome development&quot; and said the ministry already received &quot;good co-operation&quot; from internet companies such as Google and Facebook. The Thai government would soon be contacting Twitter to &quot;discuss ways in which they can collaborate&quot;, she told the Bangkok Post. In China, the state-run Global Times also endorsed the new rules in an article on Monday: &quot;It is impossible to have boundless freedom, even on the internet and even in countries that make freedom their main selling point,&quot; it said. Twitter is blocked in China, but many users access the site by accessing external networks. According to the regulations, a tweet from Thailand could be blocked at the request of an individual, a company, or the government. However, while it will be invisible to users in Thailand, the tweet can still be seen by users in other countries. Thailand has some of the toughest censorship laws in the world, ranking it 153 out of 178 in Reporters Without Borders&apos; 2011 Press Freedom Index. Thailand&apos;s lese-majeste regulations inhibit defamatory, insulting or threatening comments about the royal family, which are punishable by up to 15 years in prison, but under Thailand&apos;s 2007 computer crimes act prosecutors have been able to increase sentences. Last year, a 61-year-old Thai national was jailed for 20 years for sending defamatory text messages about the monarchy, while a Thai-US citizen received a two-and-a-half year prison sentence for translating a banned biography of the king. While the information ministry has blocked thousands of websites in recent years \u2013 mostly related to online gambling, pornography and lese-majeste cases \u2013 Monday&apos;s endorsement comes at a time of heightened tension over censorship rules. A lese-majeste monitoring centre was opened in December and is manned 24 hours a day by staff trawling the net for offensive material. Facebook users already face potential jail time if they click &quot;like&quot; or &quot;share&quot; on any sites deemed offensive to the monarchy, while anyone sending a link, forwarding or revisiting websites with lese-majeste content also need beware, authorities have said. Despite open and repeated calls for relaxed censorship laws, Yingluck Shinawatra last week said the monarchy should be respected and vowed to &quot;protect the institution, not exploit it&quot;. Thailand&apos;s endorsement on Monday could have profound ramifications across the region, said Sunai Phasuk of Human Rights Watch Thailand, while it already &quot;adds more damage to an already worrying trend in Thailand&quot;. &quot;Twitter gives space to different opinions and views, and that is so important in a restricted society \u2013 it gives people a chance to speak up,&quot; he said. &quot;But if this censorship is welcomed by Thailand, then other countries, with worse records for human rights and freedom of speech, will find that they have an ally.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-01-30T10:11:21Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Censorship", "Twitter", "Internet", "Asia Pacific", "Social media", "Technology", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/30/thailand-backs-twitter-censorship-policy", "title": "Thailand backs Twitter censorship policy", "sentences": ["The Thai government would soon be contacting Twitter to &quot;discuss ways in which they can collaborate&quot;, she told the Bangkok Post."]}, {"article": "Two prominent Libyan dissidents are suing a former senior MI6 officer in a move which could expose the role of ministers in the men&apos;s abduction to Tripoli, where they say they were tortured by Colonel Muammar Gaddafi&apos;s secret police. Lawyers for Abdul Hakim Belhaj and Sami al-Saadi have served a claim on Sir Mark Allen, the MI6 officer at the centre of the affair. They are suing Allen, then the most senior officer in MI6 responsible for counter-terrorism, alleging &quot;complicity in torture&quot; and &quot;misfeasance in public office&quot;. Whitehall officials have repeatedly defended MI6&apos;s actions, saying the agency was following &quot;ministerially authorised government policy.&quot; The case will be the first significant test of a little-known piece of legislation, section seven of the 1994 Intelligence Services Act, which protects MI6 officers from liability for criminal acts abroad as long as their actions have been authorised by a cabinet minister. Jack Straw, who was foreign secretary at the time, and former prime minister Tony Blair, have both sought to distance themselves from the matter. In a BBC radio interview, Straw said: &quot;No foreign secretary can know all the details of what its intelligence services are doing at any one time.&quot; Straw declined to comment on Monday but has said in the past that he was &quot;always happy to deal with any questions relating to his time as home secretary or foreign secretary&quot;. The two men are also claiming damages for &quot;unlawful detention, torture, inhuman and degrading treatment, batteries and assaults&quot; by US, Thai, and Libyan agents. In a claim which has been sent to government lawyers, the men&apos;s solicitors, Leigh Day, told Allen that if he denied the claims, they would demand disclosure of documents, including MI6 communications with Gaddafi&apos;s government, the CIA, MI5 and other British government agencies. The law firm has demanded a response within six weeks. In a letter to former Libyan foreign minister Moussa Koussa, dated 18 March 2004, senior MI6 officer Allen said: &quot;I congratulate you on the safe arrival of Abu Abdullah al-Sadiq [also known as Abdul Hakim Belhaj, now Tripoli&apos;s military commander]. This was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over the years.&quot; A few days later, Blair visited Gaddafi in a highly-publicised meeting in the Libyan leader&apos;s tent. Saadi was detained in Hong Kong in 2004 and then forced on to a plane to Tripoli with his wife and four children in an operation that MI6 allegedly mounted in co-operation with Koussa, who was Gaddafi&apos;s intelligence chief at the time. Saadi says he suffered years of torture. Belhaj was detained in Bangkok along with his pregnant wife after an MI6 tipoff and was allegedly tortured by American agents for several days before being flown to Tripoli, where he says he was tortured and detained for several years. His wife was detained for several months. Section seven of the 1994 Intelligence Services Act says British security and intelligence officers would not be &quot;liable under the criminal or civil law of any part of the United Kingdom&quot; as long as the authorisation has been signed by a senior minister. The clause has been described as a &quot;licence to kill&quot;. When the legislation was considered by parliament, ministers made clear there could be circumstances in which it could be used to authorise what they described as &quot;lethal force&quot;. There were warnings at that time that it could be used to indemnify torturers against prosecution. Allen&apos;s involvement in the rendition of the couple was spelled out in a number of documents discovered in a Libyan government office shortly after the collapse of the Gaddafi regime last summer. Following the discovery, Whitehall sources with knowledge of the operation made no attempt to deny MI6 involvement, but immediately said it had been part of &quot;ministerially-authorised government policy&quot;, a clear signal that a secretary of state had signed off on the rendition of the couple. Earlier this month, the Metropolitan police announced it was opening a criminal investigation into the rendition of Belhaj and Saadi, who is also known as Abu Munthir al-Saadi.. There have been reports that Straw will be questioned as part of the Scotland Yard inquiry. The case against Allen is to be followed by civil proceedings against MI6 and MI5, part of a growing number of claims against the British government and former officials alleging complicity in kidnap and murder \u2013 claims that the government wishes to see being considered in secret.

So Thai police officers on a routine street patrol in north-east Bangkok had a lucky break when, by chance, they crossed paths with a member of a wild animal meat gang who had nipped out to buy some butchering supplies. On following the man, Thai police discovered four other men chopping up a large male tiger. Zebra, crocodile, wild buffalo and elephant carcasses, along with 400kg of tiger meat, were also found in the building, ready to be sold as exotic meat and trophies. &quot;We found one tiger in an ice box, where it was being preserved with formaldehyde, and a lot of bones. On the floor, there were fresh cuts of white tiger, elephant and lion skins,&quot; the Thai nature crime police commander, Colonel Norasak Hemnithi, said. &quot;The suspects later told us that they had gone out looking for ice to store the fresh meats.&quot; Police have since arrested eight people, including the alleged mastermind, in what they and local wildlife organisations believe is a smuggling operation fronted by Bangkok zoos. The case has shed light on Thailand&apos;s place at the heart of an estimated $10bn global trade in endangered species that is driving many plants and animals to extinction, according to wildlife groups. It highlights a worrying trend in which the meat of endangered animals is sold in resort restaurants in southern Thailand. Demand for trophy items and exotic meats across Asia, but particularly in China, has driven up the trade in elephants, big cats, reptiles and birds. The anti-wildlife trafficking group Freeland, which is working with police on the investigation, suspects the animals came from, or were sold through, private zoos in Thailand. &quot;It&apos;s hard for police to go after zoos because there&apos;s a legal loophole [here] that can easily be used to front a breeding operation. Zoos have a permit to own tigers, so they can breed the tigers and sell the offspring,&quot; said a Freeland spokesman, Roy Schlieben, adding that an adult tiger could fetch more than $10,000. Raids in Thailand, which heads the 10-country Asean Wildlife Enforcement Network in south-east Asia, have risen nearly tenfold in five years, Freeland said. The director general of the Thai wildlife agency said last month that poachers had slaughtered two wild elephants for their meat in a national park. Damrong Phidet told the Associated Press that trunks and sexual organs had been ordered by restaurants in Phuket. Some of the meat was to be consumed without cooking, like &quot;elephant sashimi&quot;, he said. But critics claim police are only touching the tip of the iceberg. &quot;A lot of catches are lucky catches,&quot; Edwin Wiek, of Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand, said. &quot;In Saturday&apos;s case, the criminal was only caught because he went to 7-Eleven and had blood on his hands. These criminals are making a lot of money and have nothing to fear \u2013 the penalties are very low and hardly any jail sentences are given to these people.&quot; The men arrested this month could face four years in prison and fines of 40,000 baht (\u00a3820) for illegally processing wild and protected animals, but Wiek and Schlieben said prison terms were unlikely and called for harsher penalties. Tiger skins are often sold as trophy items to wealthy buyers in China, Thailand and Vietnam, with animal parts such as tiger bones being used in traditional Chinese medicine, Schlieben said, adding: &quot;Then you&apos;ve got mounted tigers, considered status symbols, and wild meat being consumed because it&apos;s &apos;more healthy&apos; than domesticated animals.&quot; Despite the increased number of wildlife criminal arrests in the past few years, Thai police have admitted they are still far from cracking the organised smuggling of animals through Thailand and abroad. &quot;We see about 100 [wildlife] cases per year,&quot; Norasak said. &quot;We&apos;re [usually] able to catch the criminal but not the [mastermind] behind him. But we work consistently to investigate further and process cases.&quot; The raid was the latest in a string of high-profile cases.

Obviously tired of Luis Su\u00e1rez grabbing all he headlines, Carlitos will amble back to play his part in Manchester City&apos;s title run-in. &quot;Everyone knows Carlos is a top player,&quot; Roberto Mancini said this week, telling everyone what they already know. &quot;If he was here and playing it would be better, because Carlos can change games.

So everything is coming up rosy for Manchester City. All they need now is to return to the top of the Premier League table.  To do that they must travel to Villa Park and get a result against an Aston Villa side who, under Alex McLeish, veer from soul-destroying-ly inept to something a little bit better than that. With just one league win this year Villa desperately need three points and a big scalp and that. Villa have shown glimpses of cohesion recently (and occasionally it all comes together such as the victory over Chelsea on 31 December) but those performances have been so rare that Villa fans are putting McLeish forward for  Harry Redknapp&apos;s  the England job.

That&apos;s why Given is at Aston Villa.  3.51pm: Richard Dunne has scored seven goals against Manchester City.

Heads must roll. Maybe City could put their tracksuit tops back on.  6 min: Kit-clash-gate is the only talking point of the game so far as Manchester City knock the ball around on halfway and Villa let them have it. When Everton beat City a couple of weeks ago they hounded them from start to finish. Villa are going to try the softly-softly approach it would seem. &quot;Casual?&quot; says Shane O&apos;Leary of my email address. &quot;I&apos;m intrigued, are you deploying the verbs, nouns and all that from a leatherette couch, your smoking jacket saucily askew as you contemplate the horror / joy of a Mancini, Money n Tevez conciliation?&quot; Yep. You&apos;ve nailed it.  8 min: BREAKING NEWS ... Shay Given has changed gloves. This game has everything.  9 min: Barry robs Petrov but, with Silva and Aguero making runs behind the Villa defence, he can only find an opponent. I would blame the shirt clash but then again it is Gareth Barry.  11 min: This is a very tame opening. Perhaps both sides have been reading all the apologies and contrition coming out of Anfield and though &apos;why can&apos;t we all just get along?&apos; Barry tries to pick out Aguero with a long, angled pass but Richard Dunne intercepts.  14 min: &quot;Kit clash,&quot; says Matthew Charlesworth of the only interesting aspect to this game so far. And it&apos;s not even that interesting. &quot;It looks like 22 Aston Villa players until my eyes readjust every few seconds to realize some of them are City players. Would Villa win even if everyone on the pitch were playing for them?&quot; I think the question is could Villa win even if everyone on the pitch were playing for them?  15 min: More on kit-clash-gate, this time from Philippa Booth: &quot;There&apos;s some quality knitted headgear being sported by the home fans, perhaps that could be the answer. No snoods, obviously, that would be dangerous. But bobble hats could be a big help.&quot; Bobble hats are the answer. The future.  17 min: Villa have a free kick in a relatively dangerous position. Petrov floats it across the area where Richard Dunne arrives and heads goalwards but it&apos;s a routine save for Joe Hart. &quot;On this day of apologetic days, I&apos;d like to apologise as a Liverpool fan for everything Ryan Dunne has done or will do (till Friday, let&apos; s say),&quot; says Ian Copestake. &quot;There you are, Ryan, you&apos;re covered. Go and be bad.&quot;  18 min: Silva drifts into the inside right position (which is probably called a false seven in modern parlance). He tries to bend a shot past Given but doesn&apos;t catch it right and it&apos;s an easy save.  19 min: Gareth Barry shoots low from the edge of the area. It goes through a crowd of bodies which includes David Silva who is miles offside but Given is able to stop. &quot;regarding the e-mail at 14 minutes winning with 22 Villa players,&quot; says Richard Johnson, &quot;you could probably count on Dunne or Collins for an own goal or two.&quot; I think 22 Aston Villa players on the pitch has a draw written all over it.  22 min: Matthew Charlesworth writes: &quot;In the States, Fox Soccer Channel showed the team lineups before the game and had Petrov on the right wing and Albrighton in the middle for Villa, while City are apparently playing Gareth Barry on the right wing (he&apos;s such a throwback to old fashioned wingers), Milner in the middle of midfield, and Adam Johnson up front with Aguero, in a 4-4-2. How lazy is that? And amid all the to do recently about Fox (and not Fox Soccer Channel) showing Arsenal v Man United, it wasn&apos;t actually on Fox but a different Fox-affiliated Channel that doesn&apos;t have Fox in its name. And they cancelled Arrested Development. And all those other things they do. I think this ranks as the second most interesting aspect of the game.&quot; No it doesn&apos;t.  23 min: &quot;Ah, kit clash,&quot; says Matt Dony. &quot;The gift that keeps giving. That&apos;s your email input sorted for the rest of the game.&quot; Well if something would just happen in the match then we could move on, but nothing is happening., Nowt. Nada.  4.25pm: Wait!!! here comes Sergio Aguero. He twists and turns at the edge of the Villa area, skips by a couple of challenges and dinks a cross from the byline to ... nobody in particular. Oh well.  26 min: City are turning up the heat now. First Silva tries to pick out Milner who can&apos;t control and Dunne hacks behind for a corner. Villa fail to clear the set-piece fully and it eventually lands at Adam Johnson&apos;s feet. He skips inside from the right and fires a low left-footed shot which beats Given at his near post but crashes back off the woodwork.  29 min: Ag\u00fcero is making a play to become a talking point. He drifts by two or three challenges in that slalom style of his but gets his shot all wrong. Tom Shaw has a question: &quot;Wouldn&apos;t it be an idea to have an observer in the stands at every match, and if he deemed the game to be lacking in entertainment both sides would have to play the second half in exactly the same kit, except maybe for socks? It would certainly liven things up.&quot;  31 min: &quot;Keep me updated with the score please,&quot; says Luqman Jansen. I&apos;ll do more than that Luqman. I&apos;ll describe interesting and exciting incidents if and when they occur. So far it&apos;s mainly just the kit clash. The key talking points are, according to Matthew Charlesworth, &quot;1) Kit Clash; 2) Fox Soccer Channel; 3) The match. &quot;The co-commentator just informed us that Sergio Aguero is &quot;not the tallest&quot;. Thanks for that.&quot;  34 min: City are well on top now as they have been for the whole game but they&apos;re creating chances now. Adam Johnson goes around the outside of Cuellar and cuts back to Aguero. he doesn&apos;t catch his shot cleanly. I think it&apos;s going wide but Collins doesn&apos;t take any chances and boots clear inside the six-yard box.  35 min: Aston Villa are going to win this 1-0. Now there&apos;s a talking point. &quot;A false Seven in footballing parlance would mean not getting anyone&apos;s head in the box,&quot; says Ian Copestake.  39 min: Petrov tries to pick out Robbie Keane but the pass is overhit and Lescott comes across to mop up the danger. Not literally, that would be ridiculous. Or would it? Maybe all players should be forced to carry around household cleaning products. They could adopt them as nicknames. James &apos;the duster&apos; Milner.  39 min: Free kick to Manchester City. Kolarov shoots but it&apos;s over the bar. Aguero has another effort after James &apos;garlic crusher&apos; Collins mis-controlled. Again it&apos;s high and wide. The kit clash is more pronounced that the accompanying photo would suggest, by the way.  41 min: A corner for Aston Villa. Petrov ping sit towards Richard &apos;The Fridge&apos; Dunne who flings himself at the ball, which seems to smash into his face and goes high in the air before landing on the roof of Joe Hart&apos;s net. &quot;Poor old Richard Dunne,&quot; says Adam Timmins. &quot;I like the bloke, he&apos;s a good honest defender who gives it his all, but his legs have gone.&quot;  44 min: Where&apos;s Carlos Tevez? That&apos;s what I want to know. Actually I don&apos;t really. Here&apos;s Ryan Dunne on what he&apos;s calling &quot;tracksuit-gate&quot;. &quot;Personally I regard tracksuits as suitable for hot dates, job interviews, weddings, graduations, funerals, bar mitzvahs and all other occasions (but I am Glasweigan, so YMMV). It does tho depend on the material used; velour can be a classy look, as rocked by Nas, Rick Ross and, er, Kim Kardashian .&quot;  Half time: Aston Villa 0-0 Manchester City. In summary: yawn.  Half time emails ...  From Ryan Dunne: &quot; Hey, don&apos;t diss Richard Dunne! He&apos;s the player I live vicariously through, dreaming of the moment when the MBM will refer to a &quot;R.Dunne scores the winner with a glorious 30 yard volley!&quot; Be fair, some of those OGs have been lovely finishes.&quot;From Matt Dony (about Ryan Dunne): &quot;So many emails I&apos;ve read from Ryan Dunne, but never realised he was Glaswegian. From now on, I&apos;ll read his words in a comedy scotch accent. So something interesting has come from this game afterall.&quot; Matthew Charlesworth asks: &quot;Is this as boring as ... Ireland vs Norway in the 1994 World Cup? That&apos;s still the benchmark.&quot;  I would say this is as boring as the Antique&apos;s Roadshow on a wet Sunday in March when the remote control is out of reach and you are incapacitated on the couch on account of having hit the confidence-booster too hard the previous evening.  Peeep!!!: They&apos;re going to persist with this so we&apos;re underway in the second half. Things can only get better, right? &quot;Greetings from Bangkok,&quot; writes Maher Sattar. &quot;Re: Ian Copestake&apos;s email earlier, I suppose a False Sven would be an unfaithful English national team manager. In other news I was pretty disheartened when Lukas Podikski didn&apos;t join Arsenal in The winter, but it seems now that his January rejection was a False Nein? I don&apos;t know why I&apos;m emailing this to you, it&apos;s pretty much a Given that a joke&apos;s not worth Shay-ring if you don&apos;t laugh at it yourself.&quot;  46 min: City are straight onto the attack and Kolarov wins a corner on the left, It&apos;s a great delivery from Milner and it&apos;s met by Kompany who heads goalwards but first Alan Hutton and then Emile Heskey (I forgot he was playing) head the ball clear. Given claims the second corner. &quot;On the right hand side of the MBM report, it lists the scores from today&apos;s other matches,&quot; says Adam in New York. &quot;Is there any way you can take these scores down? It&apos;s as if they&apos;re there to taunt us! Especially when Bordeaux beat Lille 5-4. We can only dream of such a score line.&quot;  48 min: Now Villa are on the attack and win a corner on the right. This game has everything. &quot;I&apos;m at The Latchmere Battersea for a bit of theatre,&quot; says Gary Naylor, who seems to be going to the theatre a lot these days. &quot;It feels strange because I was last here watching Italia 90 in the pub downstairs. For so many reasons, I wish it were 1990 again.&quot;  50 min: &quot;That&apos;s unfair on Ireland,&quot; says Niall Mullen. &quot;Surely the boring benchmark must be the Italia &apos;90 clash between Egypt and, er, Ireland.&quot; Meanwhile Holly in USA! USA!! USA!!! has a very valid point in her email titled: &quot;Shouldn&apos;t it be &quot;kit resemblance&quot;? &quot;Since I can&apos;t see the game, perhaps I&apos;m missing something, but if the kits are too close in color, they&apos;re not clashing are they? And since New York Fashion Week is going on, I&apos;d say &quot;clash&quot; suggests an inharmonius pairing of something like orange and brown.&quot;  52 min: Pablo Zabaleta goes all Sergio Aguero and is tripped by Darren Bent. Silva takes a wickedly inswinging free kick which Joleon Lescott, his team-mate, heads clear. &quot;Evan, City risk losing the title by succumbing to the ennui of the super rich,&quot; says Damian Durrant. &quot;They just don&apos;t look much bothered do they? Of course they get paid exorbitant salaries no matter what. Maybe the players need incentives - extra gold bars for a goal etc.&quot;  55 min: Cuellar gives the ball away to David Silva who in turns gives it back to Villa. Good news for those two restaurants in Manchester: Carlos Tevez will be back on Tuesday. &quot;New talking point,&quot; says Alan Steenstrup. &quot;In the picture what are Adam Johnson and Carlos Cuellar looking at which is causing them so much mirth?&quot;  56 min: A shot! An actual shot! It&apos;s Pablo Zabaleta from a tight angle and it&apos;s easily saved by Shay Given. Gary Neville reckons he should have picked out David Silva. Just let the man shoot. &quot;Here now,&quot; says Niall Harden. &quot;Emile &quot;the pestle&quot; Heskey has been Villa&apos;s best player, in that he&apos;s completed the most half-hearted hoofs forward and put it out for a corner more than anyone else. Playing a blinder, if that&apos;s what you&apos;re after.&quot;  58 min: Another shot. Now they&apos;re really spoiling. If we want to be pedantic it&apos;s a cross-shot from Kolarov. Aguero sticks out a leg to try and divert it goalwards but he can&apos;t quite reach it and goes behind. &quot;To continue the silly word-debate started by Holly,&quot; writes Flor in BELGIUM! BELGIUM! BELGIUM! &quot;The kits are &quot;clashing&quot; because two sets of outfits that look alike are indeed an &quot;inharmonious pairing&quot; for the purposes of playing a game of football.&quot;  61 min: David Silva tries a scooped pass through to Johnson. Richard Dunne leaps acrobatically (is there any other kind?) deftly controls the ball, spins and boots it as hard as he can straight out of play. That&apos;s the best thing I&apos;ve ever seen on a football pitch.  62 min: Yellow card for Petrov who sticks out a leg and trips Silva. The Spain man gets up and whips in a free kick which Collins does well to head behind.  63 min: Goal!! Aston Villa 0-1 Manchester City (Lescott) City have a deserved lead and it&apos;s Joleon Lescott who sweeps in Barry&apos;s nod down from Milner&apos;s deep corner. It&apos;s a smart finish from the centre back but it&apos;s very sloppy defending from Villa.  66 min: Villa look a bit of a shambles at the minute as Johnson and then Aguero cause problems. What can Villa do to respond? Probably nothing is the answer.  67 min: Yellow card for Richard Dunne for going through the back of Aguero. Speaking of which, Ian Burch writes: &quot;You don&apos;t like to see players getting injured, but this game could do with a back four player on both sides getting a knock. The introduction of Warnock and Savic would surely make it a better game. Heskey can&apos;t liven it up all on his own.&quot; I have actually just suffered a recurrence of a shoulder injury I sustained trying to capture a dog from under a bed. I should be ok though. Don&apos;t worry.  69 min: City appeal for a penalty as Johnson&apos;s cross hits Hutton&apos;s hand, which was down by his side so it would have been harsh. Charles N&apos;Zogbia is on for Emile Heskey.  69 min: &quot;Surely Kuyt is the archetypal false seven?&quot; asks Marek Miernik. &quot;Much like G. Johnson is the false two and Downing is the false eleven. Is there an Andy Carroll joke in there somewhere?&quot; He&apos;s the false \u00a335m.  71 min: An attack from Aston Villa!! Cueller knocks in a fairly aimless ball which Darren Bent does well to get a head to and it&apos;s gathered by Hart. Still, it&apos;s an attack. &quot;Trying to catch a dog while carrying a bed on your back sounds like the perfect recipe for getting a shoulder injury. Well done.&quot; says Alan Streenstrup.  74 min: N&apos;Zogbia has given Villa some life. They&apos;re now only half-asleep. On that subject Ciaran McGowan writes: &quot;I think that McLeish plays far too many defensive players, who offer nothing going forward such as Heskey.  76 min: There&apos;s a streaker on the pitch. The stewards are after him. We can&apos;t see this. We&apos;re looking at Shay Given wiping his face with a towel while Gary Neville is talking about players driving to training. This is a great game.  76 min: Richard Dunne pings a ball out to Alan Hutton in an attacking position. Hutton takes the safety first option and heads it out of play. They can&apos;t score from there. Stephen Ireland is on for Marc Albrighton.  79 min: &quot;I feel like organising a demo against Alex McLeish and I&apos;m not even a Villa fan - they are awful,&quot; says Fraser Thomas. Don&apos;t be so harsh, Fraser. Petrov just had a shot which nearly deflected into Cuellar&apos;s path. That&apos;s practically total football as far as Villa are concerned.  80 min: A header on target from Richard Dunne and at the right end and everything. Joe Hart saves easily. &quot;Is N&apos;Zogbia giving AV the necessary infusion of Insomnia to wake them up from their slumber?&quot; wonders Alan Steenstrup.  82 min: Lovely play from City as Milner gets in behind the Villa defence on the left but his attempted cross towards Aguero is booted clear. If you were awarded points for booting clear then Villa would be doing very well. That Richard Dunne punt to touch would be worth 100 points. Samir Nasri replaces Adam Johnson.  85 min: David Silva dances down the left but can&apos;t pick out Nasri in the centre. With N&apos;Zogbia and Ireland on the pitch Villa actually have players who want the ball and can pass it and can actually do something. It&apos;s a crazy concept but it might just catch on. &quot;Regarding the mirth in the Johnson and Cuellar picture (55mins),&quot; says Adam, &quot;maybe this elusive dog of yours has run on to the pitch at Villa Park. The dog is obviously more dangerous and not as playful as the Anfield Cat, so Johnson and Cuellar are trying to entice the little fella without injuring their respective shoulders.&quot; Good luck trying to catch him is all I&apos;ll say.  88 min: Villa&apos;s best chance of the game. It comes from a floated Petrov corner. It&apos;s met with a clean header by Cuellar but he doesn&apos;t get over the ball and it&apos;s just over Hart&apos;s crossbar. He should have hit the target. Edin Dzeko is on for Sergio Aguero.  89 min: Another corner for Villa as Kolarov heads behind under pressure from Collins ...  90 min: Brilliant save from Hart as Bent spun and hooked Collins&apos; nod-down towards goal. It&apos;s a fantastic stop from the City keeper. It looked a certain goal. Micah Richards comes on for David Silva. Three minutes of stoppage time.  90+1 min: Richard Dunne is down injured after Hart came and punched clear and took everyone in his way with him. The referee gives City a free kick. &quot;Are you sure it was a streaker, not just someone deciding to play in skins in an effort to resolve the kit resemblance issue?&quot; asks Thomas Hopkins.  90+3 min: Gareth Barry is named man of the match as Richard Dunne is escorted from the field holding his shoulder. Nathan Baker comes on for Dunne, who should have been awarded the man of the match award for that deft control and boot clear.  90+4 min: Gareth Barry nods the ball back to Hart who comes sliding out to gather but very nearly loses the ball. That was almost Villa&apos;s best chance of the game. That&apos;s how bad they&apos;ve been.  Full time: Aston Villa 0-1 Manchester City. Joleon Lescott&apos;s second half strike wins it for Roberto Mancini&apos;s side who go back to the top of the league. It was, in many ways, the kind of victory you associate with title winning sides. They were far from their best - though they dominated throughout - but ground out the win. Villa were dismal - truly dismal - and didn&apos;t bother attacking until the final few minutes when they caused City some problems and, but for a stunning Joe Hart save, would have scored an unlikely equaliser. That&apos;s it from me. Thanks for your emails. Sorry I couldn&apos;t publish them all.

The attacks on Monday, in which four people were injured, followed a warning from Iran&apos;s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, earlier this month that the Islamic Republic would retaliate against international sanctions and would back any nation or group that sought to confront Israel. In Delhi, witnesses said they saw assailants on motorcycles attaching a device to a car when it stopped at a traffic light. In the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, an Israeli embassy driver discovered a device planted on the underside of his car. Within hours of the apparently co-ordinated attacks in the Indian and Georgian capitals, Netanyahu said: &quot;The elements behind these attacks were Iran and its protege, Hezbollah.&quot; Tehran, he added, was the largest exporter of terror in the world and was also responsible for recent attempted assaults on Israeli targets in Azerbaijan and Thailand. Israel, he said, would act with a strong hand. The foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, said Israel &quot;know[s] how to identify exactly who is responsible for the attack and who carried it out&quot;. Iran described the accusations as &quot;sheer lies&quot;. Mehdi Nabizadeh, ambassador to Delhi, was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency in Iran as saying: &quot;Any terrorist attack is condemned [by Iran] and we strongly reject the untrue comments by an Israeli official.&quot; The modus operandi in both incidents mirrored the assassination of an Iranian nuclear scientist in Tehran last month, which Iran claimed was carried out by agents for Israeli intelligence. The Iranians also blamed Israel for a string of earlier assassinations and covert operations. Many in the international community have voiced alarm at the prospect of a low-intensity war between the two states conducted by intelligence operatives and their proxies. Speculation that Israel is preparing for a military strike on Iran&apos;s nuclear installations has also grown. There has been no claim of responsibility for the attacks, which were initially linked to the anniversary of the assassination of a Hezbollah militant in Lebanon four years ago. Israel is working on the theory that Hezbollah carried out the attacks but with Iran&apos;s blessing. Four people, including the wife of an Israeli diplomat, were reported injured when an explosion wrecked a car which had a diplomatic number plate. According to BK Gupta, the Delhi police commissioner, the woman noticed a passing motorcyclist attach what appeared to be a magnetic device to the car when it slowed at a junction 300 metres from the Indian prime minister&apos;s heavily guarded residence, close to a military compound in the diplomatic quarter. There was a loud sound, an explosion and the car caught fire, he said. The woman, Tali Yehoshua-Koren, married to the Israeli defence attache, was taken to hospital for treatment and was expected to fly to Tel Aviv later. In Tbilisi, an explosive device was safely defused after being found under a car of a man employed as a driver at the Israeli embassy. Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, an Iranian nuclear scientist, was killed in Tehran a month ago when magnetic bombs were attached to the side of his car. He was the fourth scientist to be assassinated in two years. The Israeli ministry had warned missions internationally of attacks around the anniversary of the death of Imad Mughniyah, a senior Hezbollah figure killed in 2008. Hezbollah, which has close ties to Iran, accused Israel of being responsible. High-ranking officials have also warned of the threat to Israeli targets from Iran or its allies. Yoram Cohen, the head of Shin Bet, Israel&apos;s internal security agency, said this month that Iranian agents were trying to attack Israeli targets around the world in retaliation for covert operations, including the killing of Iranian scientists. He cited &quot;three serious attacks&quot; in recent months thwarted &quot;on the verge of being carried out&quot; \u2013 in Istanbul, Baku and Bangkok.&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if it&apos;s true or not that Israel took out the nuclear scientists,&quot; he told a closed meeting, reported in the Haaretz newspaper. &quot;A major, serious country like Iran cannot let this go on. &quot; India has favourable relations with Iran and had said it would continue to buy oil despite sanctions by the US and other countries.", "publicationDate": "2012-02-14T07:51:00Z", "tags": ["Israel", "Iran", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/14/israel-accuses-iran-of-attacks", "title": "Israel accuses Iran of attacks in Delhi and Tbilisi", "sentences": ["He cited &quot;three serious attacks&quot; in recent months thwarted &quot;on the verge of being carried out&quot; \u2013 in Istanbul, Baku and Bangkok.&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if it&apos;s true or not that Israel took out the nuclear scientists,&quot; he told a closed meeting, reported in the Haaretz newspaper."]}, {"article": "     An Iranian man has blown off his own legs and wounded at least four other people in grenade attacks in Bangkok, according to the police. It remains unclear what the man&apos;s targets were, but the blasts come just a day after two bomb attacks aimed at Israeli diplomats in India and Georgia. Israel on Monday blamed Iran for the bombings in India and Georgia, a claim denounced in Tehran as &quot;sheer lies&quot;. Thai security forces found more explosives in the suspect&apos;s rented house in the capital, said Police General Pansiri Prapawat. Police said the explosions happened on Soi Sukhumvit 71, a street running off a busy road that bisects the capital. A photo posted on Twitter showed a wounded man lying on a pavement outside a school, his legs apparently blown off by an explosion. The pavement was strewn with broken glass. Several Thai television stations reported that the man had been carrying explosives. They said an identification card found in a nearby satchel indicated he may have been of Iranian descent. The Thai-Asean News network said police had identified the man as Sayed Murabi, an Iranian thought to have set off a bomb at his own house and then hailed a taxi. When the driver refused to pick him up, Murabi reportedly threw a grenade at the car. Police then pursued him before he tried to throw another grenade at them, but failed and blew off his own legs. The first explosion took place at about 2.20pm local time (7.20am GMT) at a house in the Ekamai area in central Bangkok, which three Iranians reportedly rented. Police fear there may be more bombs in the area and have closed the street to traffic. Doctors at Chulalongkorn hospital confirmed a man had been admitted as a patient but did not disclose his name or nationality. Doctors said the patient&apos;s right leg had been blown off above the knee, and his left leg was so badly damaged it had had to be amputated above the knee. Local media reported the police as saying one of the bomber&apos;s legs had been blown into a nearby school. Reports also said security was being boosted at the hospital, with police unsure whether or not to classify the man as a terrorist. In Jerusalem, the Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said there was not yet any sign that any targets in Bangkok were Israeli or Jewish.

It is illegal to use IVF for gender selection in Vietnam so the couple chose a hospital in Thailand. They paid $20,000, spent the whole of November in hospital and are now expecting twins. The timing was crucial. Their offspring will be born under the sign of the golden dragon which, for men, is the most auspicious animal in the Chinese zodiac.

Many believe that men born under the golden dragon will be wealthier, have better jobs and be more successful, says Professor Vu Dung, director of the Institute of Psychology in Hanoi. &quot;It strongly influences people&apos;s lives,&quot; he says. Unlike her husband, Hai works for the state and under Vietnam&apos;s strict two-child policy she could risk losing her job. The couple are not worried. Trung says he can find his wife a position at another school. The desire for sons is so strong in Vietnam that the gender birth ratio now stands at 111 boys to 100 girls, according to the ministry of health, well above the internationally accepted norm of around 104. In some provinces the number of boys born is 20% higher. If the problem persists, the ministry has warned that up to 3\u00a0million Vietnamese men might be unable to marry by 2030. The Vietnamese government is taking the problem seriously. Doctors are forbidden from revealing the sex of a foetus and websites or brochures advertising sex selection services are banned. In the face of high demand, clinics are still flouting the rules. The number of couples seeking advice on how to have a boy before the dragon year ends has increased sharply in the last three months, according to one doctor at a private clinic in Hanoi who did not want to be named. &quot;The law bans us from providing gender selection services, but many parents are too enthusiastic and insist doctors help them so we give them some advice,&quot; he says. &quot;Many women choose to abort female foetuses. I tell them it is extremely dangerous for their chances of having children in the future, but they insist on aborting it despite the risks.&quot; For those parents with a little more cash to spend, there are at least five travel agencies in Hanoi that act as agents for foreign hospitals, particularly in Thailand. One representative of a hospital in Bangkok that provides IVF treatment to Vietnamese clients says the number of couples seeking boys has increased by 20% in recent months compared to the same period last year. &quot;For every 10 couples who seek IVF treatment, nine want boys,&quot; she says. It is rich families who are seeking gender selection services, the former minister of health in charge of population issues, Do Ba Thuy, says. &quot;In Vietnam, many state officials who have better economic conditions want to have boys. The wealthier the couple, the more they want to have boys to inherit their property.&quot; This issue of inheritance is key. Traditionally, a son is expected to look after his parents in their old age and for this reason it is the norm for a man to inherit the lion&apos;s share. In nearly every Vietnamese house there is a shrine dedicated to the family line, but it is the job of sons, not daughters, to worship there. When a woman marries it is assumed she will worship her husband&apos;s family because according to custom the spirits of her own ancestors cannot enter the house at the same time as those of her husband. Government intervention is making a difference. In 2009, Hung Yen province in north Vietnam had the highest rate of gender ratio disparity in the country with 130.7 boys born for every 100 girls. However, the rate has now dropped to 120 boys, says Thi Khuyen, head of the provincial department for population and family planning. &quot;It reduced thanks to several measures taken by local authorities, such as public information campaigns on the disadvantages of gender disparity. We also punish clinics and healthcare centres which give ultrasounds to reveal the gender of embryos and asked healthcare centres to sign a commitment not to reveal the gender.&quot; Tackling the availability of sex selection services is just part of the battle. Women are still considered the weaker sex. &quot;Even though on some levels Vietnam is doing very well it still has some way to go,&quot; says Bruce Campbell, Vietnam representative for the United Nations Population Fund (Unfpa). The problem is expected to get worse before it gets better. &quot;One reason is you can&apos;t change bedroom behaviour overnight. Number two the interventions only target a few provinces and the third reason is you have factors like the year of the dragon where people want to have a son.&quot; That&apos;s why, he says, the government&apos;s national target for 2015 is higher than the current rate, at 113 boys to 100 girls in 2015. Hai&apos;s husband Trung agrees there is less discrimination against women than in the past but he thinks it will be 50 years before people value women and men equally. Hai agrees. &quot;Sometimes I wish I was a boy so my life would be different,&quot; she says.", "publicationDate": "2012-02-14T13:59:02Z", "tags": ["Vietnam", "Population", "Gender", "Women", "Global development"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/feb/14/vietnam-gender-birth-ratio-inequality", "title": "Vietnam's parents want a dragon son", "sentences": ["Hai went to Bangkok with two other couples, both seeking IVF treatment to have baby boys born in this year.", "One representative of a hospital in Bangkok that provides IVF treatment to Vietnamese clients says the number of couples seeking boys has increased by 20% in recent months compared to the same period last year."]}, {"article": "In monsoon seasons past, villagers in Pa Mok would quietly embark on their annual vertical migration as the Chao Phraya river swelled and spilled over its banks, inundating rice paddies and neighbourhoods of this low-lying community in central Thailand. They moved to the upper level of their homes, which were built on three-metre high stilts. Then change rolled into town, around 45 years ago in the forms of cars, roads and a bridge across the Chao Phraya that connected the eastern and western halves of Pa Mok. With industrialisation, villagers took on factory jobs, moving further from the intrinsic nature of their riverine community. &quot;Now they park their cars under the house, and they add an extra floor [of living space] under their homes,&quot; said Klanarong Chuaboonmee, 69, the deputy mayor of Pa Mok district in Ang Thong province, 100 km north of Bangkok. &quot;As someone working for the city, I get people asking me, &apos;Why don&apos;t you make it so we don&apos;t flood?&apos;&quot; Pa Mok has suffered floods nearly every year since 1942, as Klanarong recalls. Floodwaters peaked at a record 8.24 metres above sea level last year when Thailand faced its worst flooding in more than half a century. With climate change spurring increasingly erratic rainfall, the floods are set to continue. So village officials are teaming up with an innovative architecture firm to build amphibious homes and structures that will help the community live with floods, rather than build up defences against them. Chutayaves &quot;Chuta&quot; Sinthuphan \u2013 who returned to Thailand in 2006 after 14 years in New York, where he studied at Columbia University and spent years honing his trade \u2013 and his architecture firm, Site-Specific, had been on the hunt for a client such as Pa Mok village. In a prescient blog entry from 11 May 2011 \u2013 months before the flood crisis \u2013 Chuta posed these questions: if the floods get worse every year, will relocation solve the problem? Traditional Thai homes were on stilts, or even on rafts when Bangkok&apos;s network of canals was not yet paved over and the city was still known as the &quot;Venice of the east&quot;, but Thailand today depends on cars, so how can architects design a house that sits on the ground and survives floods? Site-Specific presented plans for the buoyant Amphibious House, with a prefabricated flotation device underneath. It looks like a normal modern home, but floats in the event of floods. One of the house&apos;s hidden support columns will be anchored to the ground, acting as a rail-like pillar as the house floats up or down. &quot;We wanted to work on a home that would work with the rising sea levels,&quot; the 36-year-old architect said during a field trip in January to Pa Mok and another site in western Kanchanaburi province that has served as part of the floating-house experiment. He and his colleagues were inspired by an amphibious community in southern Thailand, where homes are on stilts, with bamboo floats lashed to the underside of the living space. &quot;We took that idea and tried to create it for a modern lifestyle and using modern technologies,&quot; Chuta said. &quot;We didn&apos;t want it to look too foreign \u2013 with these [anchoring] posts. We want it to look like a normal house.&quot; A few hours drive west of Pa Mok, in the middle of the lake formed by Srinakarin Dam in Kanchanaburi province, the architect team took on their first floating venture. A wealthy advertising executive hired them to build a two-bedroom, one-bathroom floating house, made with reclaimed wood and metal, complete with a two-boat garage. Completed last November, the 400 sq metre floating house \u2013 which primarily consists of outdoor living spaces with prefabricated enclosed spaces for the bedrooms, kitchen and bathroom \u2013 has weights anchoring it to the lake floor, but it drifts and turns slightly with the water&apos;s movement. Four solar cells, a wind turbine and back-up generators provide electricity, while water to bathe and wash is pumped up from the lower depths of the lake. The house weighs 35 tonnes and is held afloat by eight hollow steel cylindrical pontoons that can support up to 300 tonnes. The fundamental lesson from the house on the lake was weight distribution and\u00a0symmetry. &quot;On a normal home, you just build it, you don&apos;t have to worry about weight distribution,&quot; Chuta said, noting that floating homes are different. &quot;You can&apos;t just take a plan of a home and then just build it. You have to design it so that the weight distribution works very well, and you have to calculate what the owners will put inside, so you can&apos;t turn a bedroom into a library because books weigh so much. So that&apos;s why the bedrooms are on the two ends \u2013 even though people don&apos;t weigh that much, if they move together, it will rock this thing quite a bit.&quot; Now, Chuta and his team have been given a chance to see if an amphibious house will work, with a $90,000 grant from the National Housing Agency. The money will be used to build a prototype for a possible amphibious community in Ayutthaya, for factory workers of the Rojana Industrial Park, which also flooded last year. The work on the other projects will help form plans for Pa Mok, where Site-Specific has met with villagers to discuss their needs and has begun to look for grants to bring amphibious structures to their community. There might be some amphibious homes, and, most important, grocery stores to guarantee food and necessities, as well as a village pavilion to serve as a space for aid distribution or for health workers.", "publicationDate": "2012-02-14T14:00:32Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Asia Pacific", "Flooding"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/14/bangkok-thailand-floods-floating-homes", "title": "Floating buildings could help Thais tackle the flooding crisis", "sentences": ["&quot;Now they park their cars under the house, and they add an extra floor [of living space] under their homes,&quot; said Klanarong Chuaboonmee, 69, the deputy mayor of Pa Mok district in Ang Thong province, 100 km north of Bangkok.", "Traditional Thai homes were on stilts, or even on rafts when Bangkok&apos;s network of canals was not yet paved over and the city was still known as the &quot;Venice of the east&quot;, but Thailand today depends on cars, so how can architects design a house that sits on the ground and survives floods?"]}, {"article": "     Israel has accused Iran of being behind three blasts in Bangkok that injured five people and blew off the legs of the alleged bomber \u2013 an Iranian national who was fleeing police when the grenade slipped through his hands and detonated next to him. The blasts came just a day after bombs targeted Israeli diplomats in India and Georgia, and has again escalated tensions between the two countries. Thai police have not yet divulged motives for the blasts, but the Israeli defence minister, Ehud Barak, directly accused Iran of exporting terror around the world. &quot;The attempted terror attack in Thailand proves once again that Iran and its proxies continue to operate in the ways of terror and the latest attacks are an example of that,&quot; said Barak. He said Iran and its Lebanese ally Hezbollah were &quot;unrelenting terror elements endangering the stability of the region and endangering the stability of the world&quot;. A second suspect was arrested at Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi international airport after authorities found explosive materials in a house apparently rented by the bomber and two others. A third suspect is still at large, according to Thai police. Thailand&apos;s national police chief, General Prewpan Damapong, said the bombs were &quot;magnetic&quot; and could be stuck on vehicles. They appeared to be intended for targeting individuals rather than buildings or large crowds. When asked whether the explosives used in India and Thailand were the same, Thai National Security Council secretary Wichian Podphosri Wichian said: &quot;They both have the same magnetic sheets attached to the bombs.&quot;The individual was in possesion of the same magnets and we are currently examining the source of the magnet.&quot;  Israel&apos;s ambassador to Thailand said they were similar to the Georgia and India bombs. The two men in custody are likely to be closely interrogated by Thai police about their intended target and who they were working for. Israeli officials said they expected the Thai authorities would share information obtained in the course of their investigation, but declined to say whether Israel would seek an active role in the interrogation of the men. Saeid Moradi, who was seriously injured in the blast, is an Iranian national who is thought to have entered Thailand from South Korea on 8 February at the southern resort town of Phuket. The second suspect has been named as the Iranian national Mohammed Hazaei, 42, who was detained after trying to board a flight to Malaysia, according to local media. The first blast was at about 2pm local time on Tuesday, when a bomb accidentally detonated inside the assailant&apos;s house in Ekkamai, a bustling residential district in east Bangkok. The blast blew off part of the roof, causing two occupants to flee, police said, followed by a wounded and bloodied Moradi. &quot;He tried to wave down a taxi, but he was covered in blood, and the driver refused to take him,&quot; police general Pansiri Prapawat told Associated Press. Moradi then threw a grenade at the taxi, injuring the driver and four others. When police tried to stop the man, he threw another grenade at them, which local media reported as bouncing off a tree and detonating in front of him. One of his legs was blown off and landed in the playground of a nearby school. Doctors at Chulalongkorn hospital, where the bomber is being treated, said the second leg had to be amputated above the knee. A satchel found near the blast contained Iranian currency, US dollars and Thai bahts, and was inspected by a bomb disposal unit. The Bangkok Post released a photo of the assailant after the blast, his face lacerated and bloodied from the attack. Another photo posted on Twitter just after the explosion showed a man, allegedly Moradi, lying in front of a school amid shards of glass, his body slumped on the pavement. No children were injured in the incident. A police raid on the assailant&apos;s house found a cache of C4 explosives and remote-control detonators. These are now being investigated, the government spokeswoman Thitima Chaisaeng told the Bangkok Post. Thai authorities said they were already alert to a potential bomb attack. &quot;There was some warning of a possible attack and police were monitoring, but we did not know where it would happen,&quot; the Thai national police chief Phrewphan Damapong told AFP. The city has been on edge since Thai police charged a Lebanese man suspected of planning an attack in Bangkok following a US warning of a threat of a terrorist strike on tourist areas last month, although Thai police said they had found no direct link. Observers fear the bomb attacks in Thailand, India and Georgia are the latest acts in a covert war between Israel and Iran over the Islamic republic&apos;s nuclear ambitions. Iran has accused Israel of assassinating several of its nuclear scientists in magnet bomb attacks \u2013 the same weapon that was used to target an Israeli diplomat in Delhi on Monday, injuring four people. In Jerusalem, the Israeli foreign ministry spokesman, Yigal Palmor, said there was not yet any sign that the targets in Bangkok were Israeli or Jewish. &quot;Security co-operation [between Israel and Thailand] is very tight,&quot; he said. Israel has raised the state of alert within the country, with the emphasis on public places, foreign embassies and offices, as well as Ben-Gurion international airport. The US embassy in Bangkok released an emergency message to all US citizens in the capital, stressing the need for &quot;heightened awareness&quot; of any suspicious behaviour, while the Thai prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, urged the public not to panic, saying it was still too early to assume terrorists were responsible for the blast. The explosions come just a month after the US embassy warned that &quot;foreign terrorists&quot; were poised to attack Bangkok and a Lebanese-Swedish man with alleged links to pro-Iranian Hezbollah was detained by police at Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport. Authorities later discovered a warehouse filled with nearly four tonnes of urea fertiliser and several gallons of liquid ammonium nitrate. Thai authorities said then that Thailand appeared to be a staging ground but not the target of an attack. The police general Pansiri said that so far, there were no links between last month&apos;s case and Tuesday&apos;s blasts. Will Hartley, editor of IHS Jane&apos;s Terrorism &amp; Insurgency Centre, said: &quot;While Israel&apos;s claims that Iran and Hezbollah are behind the attacks in India and Georgia cannot be discounted, at this stage it&apos;s impossible to substantiate such allegations, and it is unclear why Iran would risk an attack on Israeli interests in India, when India has been broadly supportive of Iran during the recent nuclear sanctions debate, and is one of Iran&apos;s most important trade partners. &quot;The alleged perpetrator of today&apos;s attempted attack in Thailand reportedly possessed an Iranian passport, possibly lending credence to Israel&apos;s allegation that Iran is waging some kind of international campaign. However, the attacks in India, Georgia and now Thailand have all been highly amateurish, and lack the sophistication that would normally be expected from an operation executed by either Hezbollah or Iran&apos;s own external operations wing, the Quds Force.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-02-15T06:11:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Iran", "Israel", "Asia Pacific", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Lebanon", "US news", "India", "Georgia", "Ehud Barak"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/14/iran-behind-thailand-bombings-barak-claims", "title": "Iran behind Thailand blasts, claims Israel's Ehud Barak", "sentences": ["     Israel has accused Iran of being behind three blasts in Bangkok that injured five people and blew off the legs of the alleged bomber \u2013 an Iranian national who was fleeing police when the grenade slipped through his hands and detonated next to him.", "A second suspect was arrested at Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi international airport after authorities found explosive materials in a house apparently rented by the bomber and two others.", "The first blast was at about 2pm local time on Tuesday, when a bomb accidentally detonated inside the assailant&apos;s house in Ekkamai, a bustling residential district in east Bangkok.", "The Bangkok Post released a photo of the assailant after the blast, his face lacerated and bloodied from the attack.", "These are now being investigated, the government spokeswoman Thitima Chaisaeng told the Bangkok Post.", "The city has been on edge since Thai police charged a Lebanese man suspected of planning an attack in Bangkok following a US warning of a threat of a terrorist strike on tourist areas last month, although Thai police said they had found no direct link.", "In Jerusalem, the Israeli foreign ministry spokesman, Yigal Palmor, said there was not yet any sign that the targets in Bangkok were Israeli or Jewish.", "The US embassy in Bangkok released an emergency message to all US citizens in the capital, stressing the need for &quot;heightened awareness&quot; of any suspicious behaviour, while the Thai prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, urged the public not to panic, saying it was still too early to assume terrorists were responsible for the blast.", "The explosions come just a month after the US embassy warned that &quot;foreign terrorists&quot; were poised to attack Bangkok and a Lebanese-Swedish man with alleged links to pro-Iranian Hezbollah was detained by police at Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport."]}, {"article": "The three &quot;Bangkok bombers&quot; suspected of attempting to carry out an attack in Bangkok are more likely to be assassins than terrorists, a senior Thai security official has said.

The move comes amid an escalation of the rhetoric between Iran and Israel over allegations made by officials in the two countries about bomb attacks in Tehran and other capitals including Delhi and Tbilisi as well as Tuesday&apos;s blasts in Bangkok. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad unveiled on Wednesday what he described as a &quot;very big new achievement&quot; in Iran&apos;s disputed nuclear programme in a ceremony at Tehran&apos;s research reactor, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. Nuclear fuel rods that Iran says have been manufactured domestically and enriched to 20% are reported to have been inserted into Tehran&apos;s reactor, Fars said. Other people present at the ceremony included the foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, Iran&apos;s nuclear chief, Fereydoun Abbasi Davani, and the son of an Iranian nuclear scientist, Majid Shahriari, who was assassinated in Tehran in November 2010 in what is widely being seen as a campaign against the regime&apos;s nuclear activities. The Tehran water research reactor, which is under the surveillance of the UN nuclear agency inspectors, produces radioisotopes for use in medical treatments and agriculture. State television also announced development of a new generation of centrifuges for use in uranium enrichment facilities that it claimed were faster and produce less waste. &quot;The fourth generation of domestically made centrifuges have a higher speed and production capacity,&quot; it said. Iran&apos;s students&apos; news agency, Isna, reported that Ahmadinejad unveiled the &quot;advanced&quot; centrifuges in a video conference with the Natanz uranium enrichment site which, according to Fars, will now be named after Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan, one of the Iranian nuclear scientists assassinated in recent years (the Fordow nuclear site, which is under a mountain near the holy city of Qom, is to now be named after Masoud Ali-Mohammadi). In a live television broadcast, Ahmadinejad said: &quot;The era of bullying nations has passed. The arrogant powers cannot monopolise nuclear technology. They tried to prevent us by issuing sanctions and resolutions but failed... our nuclear path will continue.&quot; According to Iranian claims, the &quot;fourth generation&quot; centrifuge would be able to enrich uranium three times faster than the previous capability. Iran&apos;s English-language television station, Press TV, said Tehran added 3,000 new centrifuges to its Natanz enrichment facility, increasing the total number of Iran&apos;s active centrifuges to 9,000. Experts, however, have questioned Iran&apos;s ability to make such sophisticated machines in industrial quantity. Sergei Ryabkov, the Russian deputy foreign minister, told a news agency that Moscow was concerned about Iran&apos;s nuclear progress but urged the west to resume negotiations with Tehran. Talks came to a standstill last year after several unsuccessful attempts to reach agreement on an agenda. He called on the west to &quot;search for compromises and the proposal of a solution scheme that could interest the Iranian side.&quot; He said western sanctions against the regime had &quot;zero&quot; effect on forcing Iran to comply with its international obligations. Speaking to the journal Security Index, Ryabkov said: &quot;We have no smoking gun confirming the presence of a military component and a military aspect of the Iranian nuclear programme.&quot; France and Britain added their concerns to Wednesday&apos;s reported nuclear progress in Iran. &quot;These statements are an extra concern for the international community,&quot; said French deputy foreign ministry spokesman Romain Nadal. &quot;The Iranian military nuclear programme constitutes one of the most serious threats to peace not only in the world but in the region. We are convinced that Iran continues to develop this programme. [These] announcements reinforce that conviction.&quot; A Foreign Office spokesman said: &quot;[This] does not give any confidence that Iran is ready to engage meaningfully on the international community&apos;s well-founded concerns about its nuclear programme. Until it does so, we&apos;ll only increase peaceful and legitimate pressure on Iran to return to negotiations.&quot; Iranian news agencies reported on Sunday that a senior diplomat from China&apos;s foreign ministry, Ma Zhaoxu, was in Tehran to discuss Iran&apos;s nuclear programme. Despite raising the stakes with the west by announcing new advances, Iran&apos;s state-run Arabic-language television, al-Alam, said a letter from Tehran had been sent to the EU foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, expressing readiness for fresh nuclear talks with the world&apos;s major powers, including the US, France, Germany, China, Russia and Britain, the group known as P5+1. In recent years, Iran&apos;s nuclear programme has experienced a series of dramatic setbacks: Stuxnet, a computer worm believed to have been designed by the opponents of the regime, caused damage to its nuclear programme and four of Iran&apos;s nuclear scientists have been assassinated in the past two years. Another scientist, who was wounded in an assassination attempt, was later promoted to become the country&apos;s nuclear chief. The Iranian authorities say the nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes but many western governments believe it has military applications. Tensions have escalated since a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency in November led to an oil embargo against Iran by the US and its European allies. In response to western sanctions which have recently begun to bite, Iran has resorted to sabre-rattling and threats of closing the strait of Hormuz. In recent weeks, fears of a major confrontation between Iran and Israel have grown. Meanwhile, Iran warned that it could cut off oil exports to six European countries in retaliation for the latest sanctions imposed on the regime. The announcement caused turmoil in the world&apos;s crude market.", "publicationDate": "2012-02-15T19:12:00Z", "tags": ["Iran", "Middle East and North Africa", "Nuclear weapons", "International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)", "Mahmoud Ahmadinejad", "China", "World news", "Nuclear power"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/15/iran-claims-achievements-nuclear-programme", "title": "Iran unveils nuclear progress as rhetoric escalates with Israel", "sentences": ["The move comes amid an escalation of the rhetoric between Iran and Israel over allegations made by officials in the two countries about bomb attacks in Tehran and other capitals including Delhi and Tbilisi as well as Tuesday&apos;s blasts in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "This column has tackled classics from Bologna to Bangkok, but the idea of taking on Yorkshire folk makes me a little nervous. Especially as I&apos;m about to take my life in my own hands and suggest they take too much credit for a dish which, strictly speaking, probably isn&apos;t their invention.  As Jennifer Stead points out in her essay on the subject in Traditional Food East and West of the Pennines, batter puddings have a long history throughout the British Isles (and elsewhere, as clafoutis lovers will know). Northerners, who tended to cook them underneath the roast to catch the drippings, apparently preferred them crisper and more magnificent than softie southerners, which may be why they became famous for them. Certainly it was Hannah Glasse, a Northumberland lass, who was the first to categorise such puddings as a speciality of England&apos;s largest county in her 1747 cookbook The Art of Cookery, Made Plain and Easy: recipes published prior to this make no such attribution. Perhaps Yorkshire folk were simply better at batters than the rest of us? In any case, yorkshire puddings are deservedly popular around the UK these days \u2013 so much so, in fact, that in these straitened times there&apos;s a good case for reviving the practice of serving them up first, laced with gravy, to take the edge of one&apos;s appetite before the pricier meat arrives on the scene (true Yorkshire thrift, that). This is also an excuse to show off your talents to their best advantage, claiming, like JB Priestley&apos;s Jess Oakroyd, that a yorkshire pudding is best &quot;eaten by itsen and not mixed up wi&apos; meat and potaters, all in a mush.&quot; Batter     Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall recipe yorkshire pudding. Photograph: Felicity Cloake    All batters, in Britain at least, are made from the same very basic ingredients: flour, eggs and milk \u2013 or, for a lighter result, a mixture of milk and water. James Martin, a professional Yorkshireman if ever I saw one, uses all milk, as do the Hairy Bikers (who, hailing from Cumbria and Teeside, have more doubtful credentials), and even Hannah Glasse eschews the parsimonious joys of free water.  Delia and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, meanwhile, go for near equal amounts of water and milk. Although I&apos;m inclined to go with the northerners on this one, it can&apos;t be denied that the puddings made with water have a crisper batter: the all-milk versions are softer and richer. Just the kind of thing a softy southerner might enjoy, in fact. Resting     Delia recipe yorkshire pudding. Photograph: Felicity Cloake    James Martin calls for the batter to be mixed and rested overnight in the fridge, while Hugh compromises on at least half an hour, pointing out that this &quot;serves as an excellent way of ensuring you carry out [the] vital exercise of resting the meat&quot;. Delia, meanwhile, makes it very clear she has no time for any such notion, explaining tartly that &quot;there is no need to leave the batter to stand, so make it when you&apos;re ready to cook the pudding.&quot; Marco Pierre White reckons resting &quot;makes the batter lighter&quot;, and I&apos;m inclined to agree: Hugh&apos;s puddings certainly seem to have risen better, although James Martin&apos;s versions are no more impressive, so I think eight hours is a mite excessive. I assume resting allows the flour to absorb liquid, but even Harold McGee is unable to tell me why this might improve the batter&apos;s rising potential \u2013 can Word of Mouth readers help? A secret ingredient?     Jane Grigson recipe yorkshire puddings. Photograph: Felicity Cloake    In her wonderful English Food, Jane Grigson supplies the winning recipe from a &quot;Great Yorkshire Pudding Contest&quot; held in Leeds in 1970 which, according to a contemporary Guardian report, produced results that &quot;swelled to the height of a coronation crown&quot; and tasted &quot;superb&quot;. This paragon of puddings, made by one Mr Tin Sung Chan of Hong Kong, contained one ingredient mysterious to the assembled hungry crowd: half a teaspoon of tai luk sauce.  Grigson admits that &quot;for years I puzzled over tai luk sauce, asking at Chinese groceries without success&quot;. Then an enterprising niece found what seems to be the answer: her request for tai luk was greeted with much laughter: apparently it means &quot;mainland&quot;, as in &quot;mainland China&quot;. Mr Chan, she concludes, was simply having an &quot;amiable joke at the expense of Yorkshire patriotism&quot;.  Having tried his recipe, I suspect the secret ingredient that made actually won him the contest was the extra egg he adds. Grigson&apos;s own family recipe uses 3 to 250g flour, as does Delia&apos;s version, but Chan plumps for 4. You can go too far down that line though; James Martin uses twice that number, and Hugh sticks in a couple of extra yolks, both things which I think makes the batter too rich. Remember, wherever it came from, this should be a Yorkshire dish in spirit. Fat?  Traditionally, in the days when meat was roasted on a spit, the pudding was cooked underneath, so it could absorb the delicious drippings. Although few of us have the necessary equipment to replicate this these days, it seems in keeping with the history of the dish to use beef or lamb dripping, or pork or chicken fat to impart extra flavour nonetheless. (Bear in mind that the association of yorkshire pudding and roast beef is a relatively recent one: a 1737 dripping pudding in The Whole Duty of a Woman calls for it to be cooked underneath a mutton joint. Hooray for more opportunities to eat it.)  Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, as a dyed-in-the-wool southerner, substitutes olive oil, while those posh Hairy Bikers suggest goose fat. Both produce good results, but I like the more savoury note beef dripping brings to the pudding party. Heat     James Martin recipe yorkshire pudding. Photograph: Felicity Cloake    The single most important thing to remember about yorkshire puddings is that the fat must be smoking hot before you begin cooking \u2013 you need a good sizzle as batter hits dripping. Canadian cook Susan Sampson suggests piercing the puddings as they leave the oven to let the steam out and keep them crisp, but all this seems to do is let them get cold. If you do right by your yorkshires, and eat them immediately, such drastic steps are unnecessary. (Whatever you do, don&apos;t leave them in a draught \u2013 they&apos;ll collapse.) Sampson also insists that chilling the mixture before cooking (cold batter, hot pan is her mantra), as does James Martin. I&apos;m puzzled by this \u2013 it simply seems to slow down cooking, giving the puddings a slightly gooier centre which doesn&apos;t appeal to me. Perhaps it&apos;s a taste thing. Proper yorkshire pudding should be made in one big tray, ready to carve up and dish out in slabs, but the modern habit of making individual ones is a welcome innovation as far as I&apos;m concerned \u2013 you get more crisp edge, and there&apos;s less faffing about to distract one from the important business of eating the things. Do as you wish however \u2013 after all, what do I, a southerner, know? Perfect yorkshire pudding     Felicity's perfect yorkshire puddings.

Sift the flour into a large bowl with a generous pinch of salt. Combine the milk in a jug with 150ml cold water. 2. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs. Pour in a little milk and water, and then whisk the lot together to make a smooth batter. Mix in the rest of the liquid, until you have a batter the consistency of single cream. Leave at room temperature for at least 15 minutes. 3. Once the meat has come out of the oven, turn the temperature up to 230C (ensuring any potatoes that might be lurking in there aren&apos;t going to burn in the following half hour). Put a large roasting tin, or a 12-hole muffin tin, greased liberally with dripping or oil, on a high shelf and leave for 10 minutes to heat up. 4. Take the tin out of the oven, and keep warm on the hob if possible while you ladle in the batter \u2013 if it doesn&apos;t sizzle when you add the first spoonful, put the tin back into the oven until it does.  5. Put the puddings into the oven and cook for 15\u201320 minutes until well risen and golden. Keep an eye on them towards the end of the cooking time, but do not be tempted to open the door until they&apos;re beautifully bronzed, because they&apos;ll sink. 6. Eat immediately.

But Thailand&apos;s deputy prime minister, Chalerm Yubamrung, said the three men were not linked to Hezbollah as the bombs were not designed for large-scale destruction.  &quot;It was not a terrorist act, it was just an act to demonstrate some insignificant symbol,&quot; he told reporters. Police chief General Prewpan Dhamapong told a Thai television station late on Wednesday that the bombers&apos; &quot;target was specific and aimed at Israeli diplomatic staff&quot;, hours after a senior official told the Guardian that the men were more likely would-be assassins than terrorists.  Prewpan confirmed that the DIY &quot;sticky&quot; bombs found at the blast site in the leafy Ekkamai neighbourhood of east Bangkok matched the devices that were planted a day earlier on Israeli diplomatic cars in India and Georgia, causing injuries but no deaths. &quot;The type of improvised explosives they used were the same. The type that was attached to vehicles,&quot; Prewpan said, adding that a magnetic strip found in Bangkok was the same type used in New Delhi. Bomb squads scouring the two-storey house found two DIY bombs in the form of portable radios, stuffed with C4 explosives whose &quot;kill radius&quot; extends to five metres, the Nation reported. Hand grenades were to be used as the bombs&apos; detonator. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has denounced Tuesday&apos;s violence in Bangkok, while Iran&apos;s foreign ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast has called the allegations against Iran baseless and declared Israel is trying to damage his country&apos;s relations with Thailand and fuel conspiracy theories. Thailand&apos;s government says it is still piecing together what happened when the men accidentally detonated the homemade explosives, blowing off the roof and sending the trio running into the street.  One of the men, Saied Moradi, emerged from the house bloody and disorientated, according to eyewitnesses, then threw an explosive at a taxi, injuring four Thais. He tried to throw another at police but blew his own leg off instead \u2013 the other was amputated later in hospital, where he is still in critical condition. Bomb disposal teams combed the Iranians&apos; house again on Wednesday looking for more evidence, while security forces were searching for an Iranian woman they said had originally rented it. Local media reported that the woman, named as Rohani Leila, 28, left Thailand on 5 February. Two of the men who fled the destroyed house on Tuesday have been detained by Thai police, including Moradi, while a third was arrested on Wednesday in neighbouring Malaysia after boarding a flight from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur overnight. Thai authorities have said the men face charges of illegal use of explosives and attempting to kill others including officials on duty, but not terrorism charges. The travel company that helped facilitate the Thai visas for the four suspects is being investigated by police, the Thai-Asean News Network reported. Israel has accused Iran of waging a campaign of state terror and has threatened military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran in turn has blamed Israel for the recent killings of Iranian atomic scientists and denied responsibility for this week&apos;s incidents in India, Georgia and Thailand.

Authorities in charge of online censorship in Iran, who are believed to be close to the country&apos;s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and his powerful Revolutionary Guards, have in the past few days filtered a series of websites and blogs which were operating in support of Ahmadinejad and his allies. The move comes ahead of parliamentary elections in March, described as the most sensitive in the history of the Islamic republic. Digarban, an opposition website which monitors the activities of conservatives inside the regime, has identified a list of pro-Ahmadinejad websites blocked recently, including mahramane.com and www.rahapress.com. Last year, it emerged that a rift had developed between Khamenei and his supporters on one side and Ahmadinejad and his allies on the other, each fighting for greater share of power over Iranian politics. Opponents of Ahmadinejad accused him and his close confidant and chief of staff, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, of attempting to undermine the clerical power and supremacy of Khamenei by advocating nationalistic causes in order to appeal to a larger number of Iranians. Dozens of Ahmadinejad&apos;s allies have been arrested in recent months and media adviser Ali Akbar Javanfekr, one of his top aides, this week lost an appeal against a six-month jail term. But Iran&apos;s parliamentary elections, scheduled for 2 March, are seen as an opportunity for Ahmadinejad to fight back. The current parliament, which is dominated by Khamenei&apos;s people, has been critical of Ahmadinejad and has repeatedly threatened him with impeachment. In an unprecedented move, the parliament last week summoned Ahmadinejad to answer a series of questions over the government&apos;s handling of the economy and his personal judgments. Ahmadinejad has one month to appear before the parliament. Iran&apos;s opposition and reformists have largely boycotted the coming poll, which will be the country&apos;s first elections since 2009, leaving it open for Ahmadinejad&apos;s team to oppose pro-Khamenei conservatives. The Guardian Council, which vets all candidates before any election, has not yet announced the final list of those allowed to run but many analysts believe Ahmadinejad&apos;s allies are likely to hide their allegiances in order to avoid being barred. The council has delayed its announcement of the final list of approved candidates in an apparent move to allow little time for opponents to voice discontent. The March vote, described by Iran&apos;s intelligence minister, Heidar Moslehi, as &quot;the most sensitive&quot; in the history of the Islamic republic, comes at a time when the regime is facing economic discontent at home and increasing international isolation because of western sanctions imposed after a dispute over the country&apos;s controversial nuclear activities. The rhetoric between Iran and Israel has escalated over allegations about bomb attacks in capitals including Delhi, Tbilisi and Bangkok. Many analysts doubt that Tehran&apos;s foreign policy is controlled by Ahmadinejad&apos;s government and attribute it to Khamenei and his elite Revolutionary Guards. Iran launched a fresh clampdown on web users last month, with draconian rules on cybercafes.

The Thai authorities have confirmed that the attackers, which Israel has blamed on Iran, were targeting Israeli diplomats. Bangkok&apos;s police commissioner, Lieutenant General Winai Thongson, said one of the two new suspects may have been providing training in explosives to the three Iranian men detained after their botched bomb plot injured five people, including one of the Iranians. The suspected bomb specialist was caught on CCTV as he left the house rented by the trio hours before a cache of explosives accidentally detonated. Those three men were later also caught on film fleeing the residence when its roof blew off in the explosion. After the blast, one of the men, 28-year-old Saied Moradi, wandered into a busy street and hurled a bomb at a taxi and another at police, injuring four Thais and accidentally blowing off one of his own legs. Moradi was later taken to hospital and detained by police while the other two men \u2013 one of whom fled to Malaysia \u2013 were later found and arrested. Winai said the suspected bomb specialist was of Middle Eastern descent and 52 years old, but did not release further details. The other suspect is thought to have rented the house in Ekkamai, east Bangkok, along with an Iranian woman, Rohani Leila, who police now believe is back in Tehran. Friday&apos;s admission of new suspects emerged as photographs were released of the three Iranians partying with escorts in the resort town of Pattaya, where they had stayed before arriving in Bangkok.

We have our own customers \u2026 The replacements for these companies have been considered by Iran.&quot; Iran had warned last week that it might cut oil supplies to the Netherlands, Greece, France, Portugal, Spain and Italy. Officials from the IAEA, the UN nuclear watchdog, are due in Tehran on Monday for another round of talks on Iran&apos;s nuclear activities, after they were denied access to certain nuclear sites and scientists on a visit last month. Dempsey acknowledged Israel&apos;s sense of urgency that action was needed before Tehran moved its nuclear facilities beyond reach, deep underground. Israel&apos;s defence minister, Ehud Barak, who is believed to favour an early military strike, has termed this the &quot;zone of immunity&quot;. Dempsey, who visited Israel last month to deliver a message of restraint, said it was premature to &quot;decide that the time for a military option was upon us&quot;. Economic sanctions imposed by the international community and diplomacy were beginning to have an effect. Asked by the CNN interviewer Fareed Zakaria whether he would bet on Israel not launching an attack, Dempsey replied: &quot;Fortunately I&apos;m not a betting man.&quot; In Tehran, the Iranian foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, dismissed western &quot;propaganda warfare&quot; and said Iran would continue with its nuclear programme &quot;even in the worst-case scenario&quot;. &quot;Since we believe that we are right, we do not have the slightest doubt in the pursuit of our nuclear programme,&quot; he told reporters, according to Press TV. &quot;Therefore, we plan to move ahead with vigour and confidence and we do not take much heed of [the west&apos;s] propaganda warfare \u2026 Even in the worst-case scenario, we remain prepared.&quot; As part of continuing efforts to restrain Israel, Barack Obama&apos;s national security adviser, Tom Donilon, was due to meet prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu on Sunday, as well as a clutch of senior government, military and intelligence figures during his two-day visit to Israel. The purpose of the visit was consultations &quot;about a range of issues, including Iran, Syria, and other regional security issues,&quot; the White House said. Later this week the US director of national intelligence, James Clapper, will arrive for talks with Netanyahu, Barak and the chief of Israel&apos;s intelligence agency. Both Americans are expected to impress on their interlocutors the need to give time for sanctions against Iran to have an impact. But, as the Guardian reported last week, there is a strong current of opinion within the administration that sanctions are unlikely to deter Iran and that their main purpose is to delay an Israeli strike. Diplomatic traffic between Washington and Jerusalem has increased over recent weeks as Israel has agitated for tougher action against Iran, and the US has intensified efforts to persuade Israel against a military strike. As well as a string of US officials travelling to Israel, visitors to Washington have included Barak, Avigdor Lieberman, the foreign minister, and Tamir Pardo, the Mossad chief. Netanyahu is scheduled to visit the US next month to attend the annual conference of the pro-Israel lobby group Aipac. He is expected to meet Obama while in Washington.", "publicationDate": "2012-02-20T00:06:00Z", "tags": ["US foreign policy", "US news", "Israel", "Iran", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/19/us-military-chief-israel-iran", "title": "US military chief cautions against Israeli attack on Iran", "sentences": ["Reiterating comments made in a newspaper interview, Hague told the BBC&apos;s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: &quot;I think Israel, like everybody else in the world, should be giving a real chance to the approach that we have adopted, of very serious economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure, and the readiness to negotiate with Iran.&quot; Citing attempted attacks allegedly by Iranian agents against Israeli targets in Delhi, Tbilisi and Bangkok last week, Hague said Iran was increasingly willing to contemplate &quot;utterly illegal activities in other parts of the world&quot;."]}, {"article": "A Thai court has issued a warrant for a fifth suspect involved in last week&apos;s Bangkok blasts, believed to be an &quot;explosives specialist&quot; who was providing training in bomb assembly and detonation to the three suspects already detained by police. The man, who has been named but not confirmed as Iranian national Javad Nikkahfard, 52, was captured on CCTV leaving the house at which a cache of explosives accidentally detonated on 14 February. He faces charges of manufacturing and illegally possessing explosives, and causing an explosion to physically harm others, but is thought to have fled Thailand the same day as the explosions. Last week&apos;s bizarre sequence of events began when the roof of a house allegedly rented by three Iranians blew off, sending the three men into the streets of Ekkamai, east Bangkok. Two of them fled on foot but the third, Saied Moradi, 28, threw explosives at a passing taxi and again at police. In the melee he mistakenly detonated one of the bombs and blew off one of his legs. He remains in custody along with Mohammad Khazei, 42, who was detained by authorities while trying to board a flight the same day at Bangkok airport. Police in Thailand are also awaiting the extradition of the third man, Masoud Sedaghatzadeh, 31, who is being detained in Malaysia after fleeing to Kuala Lumpur. Thai authorities also issued a warrant last week for the arrest of Leila Rohani, a woman who is believed to have rented the Ekkamai house but has returned to Iran. Police are also on the hunt for another woman, who may have rented the house with Rohani but also since returned to Iran, local media reported. Police confirmed last week that the three main suspects were Iranian and that their targets were Israeli diplomats, citing the similarity of &quot;sticky&quot; bombs used in Delhi and Tbilisi just days earlier. But authorities told the Guardian that the men&apos;s nationalities had still not yet been confirmed by Iran and Thailand&apos;s foreign minister, Surapong Towichukchaikul, told reporters the Bangkok blasts were unrelated to those in India or Georgia. According to the Shia leader of Thailand, Syedsulaiman Husaini, the suspects were probably part of an exiled Iranian opposition group rather than hit men hired by the Iranian government. They were probably trying to use the incident to overthrow the incumbent government, Husaini told the Bangkok Post. Thai media was on Monday awash with stories about the threat to tourism in Thailand as a result of last week&apos;s explosions. Tourism accounts for 6% of Thailand&apos;s GDP, but may suffer a further blow after the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force named the country one of 15 high-risk countries for failure to take sufficient steps against the financing of terrorism and money laundering \u2013 ranking it alongside Burma, Cuba, Nigeria and Syria. Thailand&apos;s national security council chief, Wichean Potephosree, said last week &quot;there are threats all over the world, and our country is a weak link&quot;.

First, there were the suspects: a supposed team of assassins hired by the Iranian government to kill off Israeli diplomats in the Thai capital. Then there was the getaway vehicle: a Honda motorcycle with a Qur&apos;anic reference underneath its seat that would trail the diplomats&apos; cars. There were the weapons: a cache of homemade C-4 explosives stuffed into portable radios, with hand grenades serving as their detonators and magnetic strips to slap the bombs on to moving targets. And, of course, there was the motive: an escalating cold war between Israel and Iran being played out in cities all over the globe, from Tbilisi to Delhi and now, apparently, Bangkok. Reporters salivate over the weird and wonderful details of such international intrigue. As I was about to soon discover, however, the epically arcane tableau of this tale would quickly be painted with even more colour. The Guardian&apos;s offices in Thailand are just steps away from one of Bangkok&apos;s busiest Jewish synagogues, under 24-hour watch since a Swedish-Lebanese man with alleged links to pro-Iranian Hezbollah was detained by Thai police last month. Israel had allegedly warned Thailand in December that an attack was &quot;imminent&quot;, but it was unclear why this mostly Buddhist nation would serve as a terrorism staging ground, or what exactly that attack might entail. So when, on Tuesday afternoon, three explosions rocked Bangkok&apos;s nearby upscale Ekkamai neighbourhood, it seemed that this &quot;attack&quot; may have happened at last \u2013 albeit in a thwarted manner. First, a two-storey house partially exploded after bombs in it accidentally detonated, forcing its three tenants to flee into the street. It was there that one of them decided to throw explosives at a passing taxi and then again at police, before setting off the bomb at his own feet \u2013 sending one of his bloodied legs into the playground of a nearby school. Almost immediately, Israel blamed Iran for the bizarre sequence of events, accusing it of &quot;continu[ing] to operate in the ways of terror&quot;. Iran, in turn, called the allegations baseless and the self-created trickery of &quot;the Zionist regime&quot;. Analysts were perplexed: the events in Tbilisi, Delhi and Bangkok seemed amateurish and atypical of an Iranian assassination or terrorism cell. Here was Iran in the process of building nuclear centrifuges, yet hiring inept assassins in Thailand who had blown up their own home and blown off their own legs? This &quot;assassination squad&quot; seemed ignorant of even the most basic of cardinal hit-man rules, among them How to Avoid Being Photographed with Escorts Days Before You Detonate Explosives. But things got really weird when I found on Friday a gaggle of police near the Guardian office randomly questioning a 41-year-old Iranian national. &quot;Routine check,&quot; the police smiled at me. The man lived nearby; one hour later, the import/export businessman would tell me the most bizarre of tales. Last month, he said, he was approached by a government official in Tehran who wanted to know where to find C-4 explosives in Bangkok. The man told him &quot;they needed the C-4 immediately, for some anniversary, and that they&apos;d pay whatever it took,&quot; the businessman told me. &quot;Then he asked if they couldn&apos;t just send someone with the explosives to travel back to Thailand with me. They&apos;d arrange for the C-4 to go through customs in Iran. When I asked him, &apos;Why, out of everyone you could ask, are you asking me?&apos; The man said, &apos;Look - if I want to travel somewhere, I could take a limo, a taxi or a bus to get there. The bus gets noticed the least ... Consider yourself the bus.&apos;&quot; The businessman staunchly refused the pitch. He flew back, alone, to Thailand, and forgot about the incident \u2013 until the bombs in Ekkamai reminded him of his government &quot;encounter&quot; in Iran, he said. His story \u2013 which was simply fantastic \u2013 was impossible to corroborate. It seemed unlikely, but given the wackiness of all the other details that had emerged so far, perhaps it was true. Maybe Iran was using amateurs like him to deflect attention. Maybe someone did bring in C-4 from outside Thailand; a bomb specialist recently told the Bangkok Post such bomb-making methods had never before been seen in the country. Mostly, however, his story drove home the difficulty of reporting the &quot;truth&quot; in a world where facts are about as changeable as the location of a sticky bomb. Asian society orbits around a custom of &quot;saving face&quot; that does not exist in the west, which means that anyone \u2013 from a high-ranking government official to an eyewitness or interviewee \u2013 can tell you what they think you want to hear, instead of what they actually know. That&apos;s why, when Thai authorities &quot;confirmed&quot; last week that the so-called Bangkok bombers were indeed Iranians targeting Israeli diplomats, other Thai authorities underlined that the suspects&apos; nationalities still hadn&apos;t been confirmed and that the Bangkok blasts were totally unrelated to those in Georgia and India. Every journalist reporting this story is doing his or her best to make sense of the chaos surrounding it. But every day brings a new twist. That&apos;s why, when my phone rang early Saturday morning, I wasn&apos;t surprised by the news. &quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; said my Iranian &apos;informant&apos;. &quot;Everything I told you yesterday, it was all just a bad joke.&quot; I wonder if that&apos;s what the &quot;Iranian assassins&quot; will say when they&apos;re finally interrogated by police this week.", "publicationDate": "2012-02-20T22:46:51Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Iran"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/20/bangkok-bombings-truth-chaos", "title": "Bangkok bombings: unravelling the truth out of chaos | Kate Hodal", "sentences": ["And, of course, there was the motive: an escalating cold war between Israel and Iran being played out in cities all over the globe, from Tbilisi to Delhi and now, apparently, Bangkok.", "The Guardian&apos;s offices in Thailand are just steps away from one of Bangkok&apos;s busiest Jewish synagogues, under 24-hour watch since a Swedish-Lebanese man with alleged links to pro-Iranian Hezbollah was detained by Thai police last month.", "So when, on Tuesday afternoon, three explosions rocked Bangkok&apos;s nearby upscale Ekkamai neighbourhood, it seemed that this &quot;attack&quot; may have happened at last \u2013 albeit in a thwarted manner.", "Analysts were perplexed: the events in Tbilisi, Delhi and Bangkok seemed amateurish and atypical of an Iranian assassination or terrorism cell.", "Last month, he said, he was approached by a government official in Tehran who wanted to know where to find C-4 explosives in Bangkok.", "Maybe someone did bring in C-4 from outside Thailand; a bomb specialist recently told the Bangkok Post such bomb-making methods had never before been seen in the country.", "That&apos;s why, when Thai authorities &quot;confirmed&quot; last week that the so-called Bangkok bombers were indeed Iranians targeting Israeli diplomats, other Thai authorities underlined that the suspects&apos; nationalities still hadn&apos;t been confirmed and that the Bangkok blasts were totally unrelated to those in Georgia and India."]}, {"article": "The Iranian embassy in Bangkok has confirmed that two of the five suspects in the bomb blasts that struck the Thai capital Bangkok earlier this month are Iranian nationals, the Thai foreign ministry has announced.

But he added that the suspects were not working for the Islamic regime or any other Iranian organisations, the Thai news agency MCOT reported. The Iranian government was not immediately available for comment. The two confirmed Iranian nationals are Saeid Moradi, 28, who lost both legs when a bomb he threw at police accidentally detonated at his feet, and Mohammad Khazaei, 42, who was detained at Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport while trying to flee to Malaysia. The confirmation of the suspects&apos; nationality comes days after Thai police admitted they were still confused by the 50-plus &quot;Sejeal&quot; stickers found in 27 different locations along an expressway that stretches through the centre of the city. Police had initially said that they were related to the explosions on 14 February, as the word Sejeal was believed to be a reference to &quot;sejeal stones&quot; in the Koran and the stickers were thought to have possibly demarcated an escape or bomb route to target Israeli diplomats. Authorities are now saying that the stickers are unrelated to the blasts and may have been placed throughout the city as early as autumn 2011. Thai forensics experts are also examining a second motorcycle found abandoned in Bangkok&apos;s Din Daeng neighbourhood, which police say was purchased by Khazaei but has not yet produced any clues.

But 20-year-old Kanthoop is not just another university student. The social welfare major has been spat at, publicly denigrated, threatened by police and faces up to 15 years in jail \u2013 for little more, she says, than &quot;having opinions&quot;. &quot;I know my case is symbolic, and I&apos;m happy about that. There is good that comes from somebody standing up and wanting to make change \u2013 sooner or later people will start to realise that.&quot; To understand why Kanthoop might be so vilified is to understand Thai society. Twice a day \u2013 at 8am and 6pm \u2013 time stands still in this nation of 69 million as the national anthem sputters out of public loudspeakers and everyone is expected to stand in silent salute. The routine testifies to the adoration Thai people feel for both their nation and their king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, or Rama IX, a man so revered that many shops and homes bear his portrait. But that reverence is backed up by the world&apos;s strictest pro-monarchy regulations, which sentence anyone who insults, defames or threatens the king or his family to three to 15 years&apos; imprisonment. Opponents argue that the law, known as Article 112, prevents healthy dialogue and is being used as a political tool to stifle dissent. Charges of lese-majesty, though in existence since 1908, have jumped since the military coup in 2006 that ousted former PM Thaksin Shinawatra, who was widely criticised for attempting to undermine the monarchy, an accusation he has long denied. In 2010 \u2013 when royalist forces bloodily battled with Thaksin supporters \u2013 478 lese-majesty charges were made and 75,000 websites blocked. Human rights groups, as well as the US, EU and UN, have voiced concern over the way the law is used. A group of Thai academics and activists, called Nitirat, have since proposed amendments to the law, but current prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, Thaksin&apos;s sister, has vowed not to touch 112 \u2014 promising in January to &quot;protect the [royal] institution, not exploit it&quot;. The debate has consequently been left to rage in the streets, where Nitirat&apos;s members face threats and harassment by royalists. &quot;This is about national security, not just about the king,&quot; said royalist Dr Tul Sittisomwong. &quot;Thai people are not that well educated \u2026 We&apos;re not that open to layers of discussion without fear of violence [regarding this subject]. The king makes peace in our society.&quot; But the existing &quot;hyper-royalism&quot; in Thailand has spiralled out of control and may actually be working to the detriment of the nation, said Thongchai Winichakul, a professor of south-east Asian history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who spent two years in prison after participating in a 1976 pro-democracy protest that saw over 100 demonstrators killed. &quot;Just look at the hyperbole [used] to describe the monarchy, the religiosity with which Thai people love the monarch and the public participation of all this royalism,&quot; he says. &quot;People are now afraid of their colleagues&quot; \u2014 because anyone can bring forward a charge of lese-majeste, he adds. It&apos;s an issue that Kanthoop knows well. Police began investigating her case in 2010 after she posted Facebook messages that were later cut and pasted by others, who she says distorted what she wrote and forwarded it by email to authorities. At her police summons on 11 February, Kanthoop was told that her case had been postponed to an unspecified date while police gather more evidence. If charged, she may well be 112&apos;s youngest offender, but she will probably not be the last. Last week a Thai court sentenced a 71-year-old redshirt supporter to 7\u00bd years in prison, while last year a 61-year-old was jailed for 20 years for sending defamatory text messages, and a Thai-US citizen was jailed for 2\u00bd years for translating a banned biography of the king. Kanthoop&apos;s political journey began in 2006, when she refused to stand up in the cinema for the royal anthem that plays before every film. &quot;That was the moment for me,&quot; she says. &quot;I decided that I have the right to stand up or not, to pay respect to whatever I believe in.&quot; While her highly politicised views have not won her many friends at Bangkok&apos;s Thammasat University, the only university to accept her even though she passed the entrance exams for two others, Kanthoop is not alone in her fight. A group of activists recently went on hunger strike outside the capital&apos;s criminal court to demand that those detained on charges of lese-majesty be granted bail. &quot;This law needs to be reviewed,&quot; says 20-year-old Panitan Pruksakasemsuk, whose father Somyot is one of those detained. &quot;Society needs to be open to change and willing to adapt to that change.&quot; As for Kanthoop, while the future is uncertain, her approach to it is not. &quot;If I have to go to jail, I will,&quot; she says calmly. &quot;Even if it&apos;s for life. But I won&apos;t plead guilty to reduce my sentence, and I won&apos;t ask for the king&apos;s pardon. I am guilty only of freedom of thought.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 7 March 2012.

In that time, virtually all of Israel&apos;s opinion formers have coalesced around the view that a war with Iran is inevitable. This was stoked not only by Iranian-sponsored actions such as the bombings against Israeli diplomatic targets in Bangkok, New Delhi and Tbilisi, but regular statements by the Israeli defence minister, Ehud Barak, and prime minster, Binyamin Netanyahu. The very suspicion of an Iranian bomb programme is framed by the latter as a threat to the state&apos;s existence, as if Israel does not possess up to 400 nuclear bombs of its own. There is nothing to say that, as nuclear powers, Iran and Israel would not be bound by the same rules of mutually assured destruction as India and Pakistan are. The purpose of Israel&apos;s narrative was to move the timeframe for such an attack forward. Mr Dagan said he did not think Iran would be able to build a nuclear weapon before 2015. Washington further distinguishes between an Iranian ability to assemble a bomb and the decision by the ayatollah to actually do so. In response to both, Israeli leaders warned that Iran&apos;s uranium enrichment programme was about to enter its &quot;zone of immunity&quot; \u2013 the idea that there is only a limited amount of time to attack Iran&apos;s nuclear installations that are all buried in mountain tunnels. It was important for Barack Obama to stand firm both publicly and in private with Mr Netanyahu. This he did when he admonished Israel and\u00a0its US supporters for too much loose talk\u00a0of war and reminded them that the world\u00a0had a\u00a0responsibility to give sanctions a chance to\u00a0work. With Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney\u00a0and Rick Santorum all scheduled to address the same audience this week, it was\u00a0important for\u00a0Mr Obama to turn down the\u00a0volume knob\u00a0on Iran. A political timetable\u00a0is at work here as well. If and when he is re-elected, Mr Obama will feel less bound by\u00a0the need to listen to a hawkish congress. Mr Obama said much to soothe Israeli ears \u2013 that its fear of a nuclear-armed Iran was legitimate and that America had a commitment to maintain Israel&apos;s military edge. What he did not retreat from were the repeated statements by senior administration officials doubting Israel&apos;s military capability against Iran. For the US military to be as aggressive as that about the military capability of its closest ally testifies to a dialogue that is tougher in private than it is in public. The National Iranian American Council ran an ad signed by an array of military brass urging the president to say no to a war of choice with Iran. The US military feels it has not been through two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan, only to be bounced into a third. Nor did Mr Obama move the goalposts. The aim of US policy, he made clear, was to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, not the capacity to build one. His strategy is clear \u2013 to get through this year without any further deterioration of the situation with Iran. He will have to go much further. As the history of every other successful piece of multi-lateral negotiation has shown \u2013 seven years elapsed between Libya ratifying the NPT and the security council vote lifting sanctions \u2013 Mr Obama will have to invest significant resources and time to defuse this crisis peacefully. For sanctions to work as an incentive, they have to be liftable. EU sanctions are enforced by an executive, the EU commission, but US sanctions are locked into place by a legislature, the US Congress.

Since the competition, my whole life has shifted into a different gear and a new direction. I took a leap of faith and left my job as a programmes officer for Medical Aid for Palestinians in September. Exactly one year to the day that I nervously flew out to Freetown for the competition, I moved to Brighton to join the fast-track course on the National Certificate for Training of Journalists at the City College and spent five happy, intense months re-training as a multi-media journalist. During that time, I&apos;ve started writing regular articles on rights and development for the New Internationalist Magazine. I run a monthly political and cultural Q&amp;A column for the magazine with public figures in the arts. I have also written for Red Pepper and the Guardian as well as several local publications in Brighton. In the wake of the competition, I&apos;ve been asked to speak at several conferences, including the Oxford Forum for International Development last November and the Global Issues Network held by the European Council of International Schools in March. It&apos;s a tough time to be starting out as a freelancer, so I am trying to diversify. One niche area that I am developing is to offer support to NGOs for their communications needs. I am currently in Bangkok with Leonard Cheshire Disability, who hosted my on my Guardian trip to Sierra Leone, helping to cover their joint conference with the UN on Disability and International Development.

It is the sort of quiz question capable of vexing football&apos;s biggest anoraks as they strive for the surprisingly exotic, distinctly offbeat, answer. Muangthong United of Thailand&apos;s Premier League barely featured on the game&apos;s world map until last summer when one of Toxteth&apos;s most famous exports opted to stop off in the outskirts of Bangkok en route back home after two seasons in Australia. &quot;It was surreal watching elephants in the streets,&quot; says Fowler, now living in north-west England and, as a free agent, open to offers from any manager seeking a peerless finisher to help his team through the final weeks of the season. &quot;Thailand was a totally new experience but I really enjoyed the differences,&quot; says the former Liverpool striker. &quot;There was definitely no chicken and pasta on the pre-match meal menus \u2013 it was all curries and hot, spicy stuff \u2013 but I eat anything and adapting was surprisingly easy.&quot; Perhaps unexpectedly the fourth-highest scorer in Premier League history did not share his fellow expats&apos; traditional complaints about enervating heat and humidity. Instead a man whose knees and ankles bear the scars of combat across more English winters than he cares to remember found the temperatures surprisingly &quot;energising&quot;. &quot;Before I went to Australia [for one season with North Queensland Fury followed by another at Perth Glory, where he finished the campaign as the team&apos;s top scorer] people warned me the heat would be a problem and I might not cope,&quot; says the 36-year-old. &quot;But even though North Queensland is tropical I had no trouble. In fact the climate probably helped. It took a week or two for my body to adjust but after that I felt great. The interesting thing is that in Australia I was never injured.&quot; Fowler fell in love with several aspects of Australian life \u2013 &quot;including the fantastic wine&quot; \u2013 and would &quot;happily&quot; have emigrated had his wife not been uncertain about removing their four children from the benefits of wider family life in England. &quot;My wife has four older sisters she&apos;s very close to, so it was entirely understandable she saw our long-term future in the UK.&quot; More immediately a man who ideally would continue playing &quot;for ever&quot; hopes to combine the completion of his coaching badges with further overseas interludes. Fowler had hoped to swap Thailand for India&apos;s inaugural Premier League equivalent only for its late postponement to stymie such plans. After signing for the Kolkata Camelians franchise he was poised to join Robert Pires, Hern\u00e1n Crespo, Fabio Cannavaro and Jay-Jay Okocha in a pioneering league intended to persuade India&apos;s population that cricket might not be quite the only sport worth following. &quot;India&apos;s still definitely on the cards,&quot; he says. &quot;I hope it happens.&quot; The closure of the door to Kolkata coincided with the opening of another rather less glamorous one at Blackpool where Ian Holloway&apos;s Championship players must wash their own training kit. While that did not perturb Fowler, the club&apos;s offer of a basic \u00a390 a week plus \u00a35,000 appearance fee provided he played the entire 90 minutes presented an insurmountable barrier. An extensive property portfolio may have helped make the former England forward one of Britain&apos;s most financially secure sportsmen but principle was at stake. &quot;If Ashley Cole nearly crashed his car when he was offered \u00a350,000 a week, I nearly self-combusted,&quot; Fowler says. &quot;I just feel I&apos;m better than that.&quot; If Blackpool&apos;s owners are unfazed by having treated a forward dubbed &quot;God&quot; by those Liverpool fans who savoured his 183 goals for their team with so little reverence, Fowler&apos;s availability has stirred the interest of Hull, Burnley, Doncaster and assorted Middle East clubs. While a lucrative stint in the Gulf holds undeniable appeal, Fowler was in Bangkok as much for the experience of the unknown as the bahts flowing into his bank account. Even so, he had not bargained on the challenge involving a first taste of management. Three months after his arrival the team&apos;s Portuguese coach, Henrique Calisto, was sacked after two defeats in 19 league games. &quot;Technically the players were very good, although their understanding of the game was always not so great,&quot; says Fowler who, following a few adverse results, found himself replaced by the more experienced Serb Slavisa Jokanovic, as he prepared to depart for India. &quot;I had a translator but the language barrier didn&apos;t help and I just felt the players had not given me their full support and weren&apos;t always really listening,&quot; he says. &quot;I wanted them to be more professional on and off the pitch. But my aim is still to be a manager. I just need a brave chairman to take a chance on me.&quot; If one does, Fowler would be tempted to send his scouts to Thailand. &quot;There are some really gifted players over there,&quot; he says. &quot;Players like Teerasil Dangda [a forward who had a brief stint with Manchester City in 2008 and became one of Fowler&apos;s Muangthong team-mates] \u2013 he&apos;s really very good. The biggest problem for Thais coming to England is adapting to our dressing-room culture and the lifestyle. But, if they can do that, they&apos;ve definitely got enough ability to succeed.&quot; Like his friend Peter Reid, a former Thailand national manager, Fowler soon learnt that indigenous players required gentle off-field handling and did not always appreciate acid sharp English-style football humour. &quot;I understand Reidy&apos;s difficulties,&quot; he says. &quot;Although I didn&apos;t swear anything like as much as Peter.&quot; He may have driven G\u00e9rard Houllier to distraction at Anfield but Fowler&apos;s knack of reading the game&apos;s subtle nuances allied to extraordinary accuracy in front of goal has earned him countless admirers. Nonetheless he wonders whether his slightly slower, more cerebral sort of forward might be a little &quot;outmoded&quot; at Premier League level these days. &quot;My type of forward, a No10, thrives in partnerships, dropping off another striker but a lot of teams now have just one up front,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m old school, I like 4-4-2 but the Premier League has definitely changed since my day. I&apos;m not saying we weren&apos;t fit but the players are a lot more athletic now and there&apos;s a much bigger emphasis on pace. That doesn&apos;t mean the standard of football&apos;s better, though. I&apos;m not sure it is.&quot; If Fowler relished seeing Liverpool revert to 4-4-2 with Luis Su\u00e1rez playing off Andy Carroll and Stewart Downing crossing from the wing during Tuesday&apos;s 3-0 win over Everton, he remains perplexed by their inconsistency. &quot;Liverpool should be really flying but, if anything, winning the Carling Cup seems to have had an adverse effect. At times they&apos;ve looked short of confidence.&quot; Fowler has rarely lacked that. What he needs now is a manager to place a little faith in his penalty area reflexes \u2026 and offer something better than \u00a390 a week.

Carved out of jungle and scrubland in 2005 at a reported cost of \u00a32bn, Nay Pyi Taw is the ultimate socialist vanity project, a testament to the vaulting ambitions of the secretive military junta that has ruled Burma for more than four decades. To obtain this rare audience, we have had to negotiate numerous roadblocks and armed checkpoints. Despite the recent installation of a western-friendly civilian government, I am half-expecting to be escorted to the border. Instead, we are sitting in high-backed teak chairs sipping tea with the chief of police and discussing how the countess&apos;s development agency, Association Fran\u00e7ois Xavier-Bagnoud, can help the government address the problem of human trafficking and the diseases, such as Aids, that come in its wake. I should say straight away that Albina du Boisrouvray, as she is more usually known, hates being called &quot;Countess&quot;, though clearly her title must have come in useful when dealing with the generals. For today&apos;s meeting, she is wearing a lightweight summer dress with a floral print, high heels, and large spiral earrings studded with what look like small diamonds. The jewellery appears expensive but, as Du Boisrouvray reveals later when we return to our hotel, the earrings are vintage and the &quot;diamonds&quot; are glass. The dress, meanwhile, was designed by an acquaintance. Nevertheless, Du Boisrouvray exudes Rive Gauche glamour and I am fairly sure that the chief of police and his colleagues dressed, like him, in regulation-issue blue uniforms have never seen anything quite like her. But appearances can be deceptive and none more so than in the case of Du Boisrouvray, a regular visitor to Burma who has been sharing uncomfortable truths with the junta for 20 years. Pleasantries and the ritual exchange of business cards over, it is no surprise when she launches into her spiel, about how FXB is no fly-by-night development agency but is passionately committed to fighting Burma&apos;s burgeoning Aids epidemic and working for the long-term betterment of the country and its people. FXB&apos;s philosophy, she explains, quoting the words of her intellectual mentor, Jonathan Mann, the former head of the World Health Organisation&apos;s Aids programme, is that you cannot hope to defeat an epidemic disease such as Aids without also addressing fundamental political and social issues. &quot;As Jonathan used to put it: health and human rights are inextricably linked,&quot; says Du Boisrouvray. &quot;They go hand in hand.&quot;     Albina du Boisrouvray meets Aung San Suu Kyi, who will contest elections with her National League for Democracy party in two weeks. Photograph: Kaung Htet    If the chief of police is surprised by her reference to human rights in a country notorious for summary detentions and the torture of political prisoners he doesn&apos;t show it. Instead, he smiles and tells her that he has heard many good things about FXB&apos;s Burma programmes and would welcome the opportunity to collaborate on human trafficking issues, something the Ministry of Interior recently decided should be made a political priority. &quot;But tell me,&quot; he asks, momentarily departing from the official script, &quot;what is it that first brought you to Burma?&quot; Du Boisrouvray hesitates, considering how best to respond. FXB&apos;s motto is &quot;Forgotten people, forgotten issues, in forgotten places&quot;. But in the case of Burma, that is only the beginning of the story. To understand how Du Boisrouvray came to be involved in Burma and how she has managed to keep FXB&apos;s programmes afloat during the darkest days of the junta, one has to return to Mali and the 1986 Paris-Dakar rally. It was during that race that her only son, Fran\u00e7ois, plunged to his death while flying a rescue helicopter over the desert. Aged 24, Fran\u00e7ois had been flying helicopters for his father Bruno Bagnoud&apos;s alpine rescue company, Air-Glaciers, since the age of 11 and was a highly experienced pilot, which is why Thierry Sabine, the rally organiser, had picked him to man his dual-control Ecureuil helicopter. No one knows exactly what happened, but it appears that after being forced to land in a sandstorm in Mali at night, Bagnoud took off again, only to crash into a dune some 20 miles short of his destination. By the time Du Boisrouvray reached the crash site, it had been thoroughly picked over by Tuareg nomads, but from the skid marks she and her husband guessed the helicopter must have suddenly lost power and flipped over as Fran\u00e7ois attempted a soft landing. Besides Bagnoud and Sabine, there were three other passengers, including the singer-songwriter Daniel Balavoine. No one survived.     A doctor checks drugs at an FXB clinic. Photograph: Kaung Htet    Du Boisrouvray, then a film producer with little interest in health and development issues, was devastated. Her response was to abandon film \u2013 in a career spanning 17 years she produced 16 features, including the 1984 desert war romance, Fort Saganne, starring G\u00e9rard Depardieu \u2013 and set up a foundation in her son&apos;s name. In 1989, she auctioned her jewellery and art collection, as well as a substantial slice of her father&apos;s real estate business, at Sotheby&apos;s in New York and put $100m into FXB. One of her first acts was to join forces with M\u00e9decins du Monde and lobby the United Nations to adopt the Convention on the Rights of the Child. To persuade countries to ratify the convention, Du Boisrouvray joined 15 destitute children on a voyage retracing the routes of African slavers. The voyage opened her eyes to the plight of vulnerable children, an issue close to her son&apos;s heart. It also coincided with growing concerns about the worldwide spread of HIV and Jonathan Mann&apos;s warning that the Aids epidemic was creating thousands of orphans, many of them infected with HIV. &quot;That was something no one had thought very much about at the time,&quot; says Du Boisrouvray. &quot;I thought, this is where FXB can really make a difference.&quot; To make the best of FXB&apos;s limited resources, she decided to channel aid specifically to children already infected with HIV. At the same time, she began supporting the extended families and communities caring for those children by setting up &quot;FXB villages&quot; offering everything from medical and psychosocial care to educational training and microfinance initiatives. The result is a network of more than 100 programmes in 15 countries, including South Africa, Uganda, Colombia and Thailand, with 450 employees and more than 1,000 volunteers. While bigger NGOs such as Save the Children may be better funded, FXB aims to punch above its weight by fostering deep relationships in the countries where it operates and committing to women and children for the long term. Du Boisrouvray is also fearless when it comes to making the connection between health and human rights. Indeed, one of the most remarkable aspects of her story is that it was her concern for the plight of sex workers who were being trafficked across the Burmese border to Thailand and her determination to repatriate the survivors, many of whom had been infected with HIV, that first forced the generals to confront the truth about the Aids epidemic in Burma and their responsibility for the ravages it was inflicting. &quot;When I came here in 1992 the generals knew nothing about Aids,&quot; she explains when I first meet her in Rangoon on a sweltering night in February. &quot;In the beginning, I think their primary concern was for the military and for their own families. But bit by bit they have opened up.&quot;     The Sunday Empowerment Group at the FXB vocational training centre in Shwepyitha, north of Rangoon, offers support to HIV positive men and women, information about safe sex and free condoms. Photograph: Kaung Htet    Du Boisrouvray is sitting on the veranda of the Governor&apos;s Residence, a luxury hotel in the embassy district modelled on a 1920s colonial-style British mansion. The fan-cooled verandas and verdant gardens are awash with returning expats and businessmen hungry to ink deals before the expected lifting of western sanctions in April. You can tell how much Burma has changed in the last year simply by the number of laptops and iPads open at adjoining tables. Prior to the installation of a civilian-led government in March 2011, access to the internet was strictly controlled and dissidents faced arrest and detention for posting blogs critical of the regime. Now former &quot;enemies of the state&quot;, such as Aung San Suu Kyi, the National League for Democracy (NLD) leader who spent a total of 15 years under house arrest in Rangoon, are allowed to campaign openly for parliament and foreign journalists are increasingly free to ask uncomfortable questions, though the Burmese press is still subject to close censorship. &quot;I never thought this day would come,&quot; says Du Boisrouvray. &quot;It&apos;s wonderful to see this opening up. Let&apos;s just hope Burma doesn&apos;t go the way of its neighbours and surrender to consumerism.&quot; In the autumn of 1992, when Du Boisrouvray arrived in Rangoon for the first time, it was a different world: &quot;No taxis, no street lights, everything plunged in darkness.&quot; There had been parliamentary elections two years earlier but, although the NLD had won a resounding majority, the military had not allowed parliament to convene. Instead, General Ne Win, the leader of the 1962 coup d&apos;etat, ruled Burma as a nominally socialist republic, pursuing a ruinous policy of economic isolation while rigging the constitution to ensure the military would always command a parliamentary majority. It had taken several months for Du Boisrouvray to arrange a visa. Her representations were not helped by the fact that earlier that summer, at the 1992 international Aids conference in Amsterdam, she had accused the junta of complicity in the murder of eight prostitutes. The previous year, with the help of a group of activist Thai lawyers, FXB and M\u00e9decins du Monde had rescued eight underage Burmese sex workers, as well as girls of other nationalities, from a brothel in Chiang Mai in Thailand. But while the Chinese and Laotians had been repatriated, the Burmese girls never made it home. Instead, Du Boisrouvray was told their bodies had been seen floating in a river on the Thai-Burmese border. Her assumption was that they had been murdered by Burmese border guards. &quot;I was screaming, &apos;I&apos;ve got to know what happened to these girls because it&apos;s rumoured they&apos;ve been killed because they were HIV positive.&apos; I told the delegates, &apos;You&apos;re talking about the prostitution of underage children but I&apos;ve got a precise case; won&apos;t you help me to do something about it?&apos;&quot; By now, Du Boisrouvray had also discovered other girls being trafficked to brothels in Ranong in western Thailand near the south tip of Burma. Incensed, she informed her friend Saisuree Chutikul, a Thai cabinet minister, who in turn instructed the Thai police to raid the brothels. They rounded up 270 women, including 95 Burmese, half of whom were HIV positive. It was Du Boisrouvray&apos;s determination to make sure they did not suffer the same fate as the other women and that they would receive access to medicines and psychosocial support in their home country that convinced her to go to Burma. Not surprisingly, at first the generals were unwelcoming and refused to grant her a visa. But eventually, after she called on her contacts at the French embassy and Burmese medics sympathetic to her cause, the regime relented. To this day, Du Boisrouvray does not know precisely what prompted their change of heart but, given her later discovery that the girls were most likely murdered by Thais, not the Burmese, she has a theory. &quot;I think it was because I was accusing them of a crime they hadn&apos;t committed and they wanted to prove they were the good guys. Also, at the time they knew next to nothing about Aids and were worried what the epidemic could mean for their families, so I was a kind of safe way for them to get information from the wider world.&quot; It was the beginning of a 20-year relationship with Burma that would see Du Boisrouvray forge close ties with some of the most senior members of the regime and found programmes that continue to pay dividends to this day. To get an idea of how FXB has made a difference to the lives of women and children in Burma infected with HIV, I journeyed with Du Boisrouvray and her Burma country director, Kathy Shein, to an FXB vocational training centre in Shwepyitha, a sprawling township north of Rangoon. There, on a tropical Sunday afternoon as the mercury nudged 40C, I was shown around workshops equipped with spindles and looms where women are trained in weaving fabrics and manufacturing bags and soft toys for local shops and markets. The centre also has a medical centre, where patients can get regular check-ups and advice on taking antiretroviral medications, as well as a kindergarten where orphans are taught the rudiments of reading and writing. However, the heart of the centre is its Sunday Empowerment Group where women and men gather to support one another while FXB staffers distribute condoms and reinforce messages about safe sex. Living with HIV is never easy, Du Boisrouvray explains, but in Burma where stigmatisation is widespread and people still believe the virus can be transmitted by touch, it is doubly hard. These challenges are brought home to me by one of the 95 sex workers repatriated to Burma 20 years ago by Du Boisrouvray. Toe Toe, now aged 44 and the centre&apos;s head seamstress, says she never intended to become a sex worker but was sold into slavery by a &quot;friend&quot; of the family who had told her he would arrange safe passage to Bangkok where she would work in a fruit market. Instead, after enduring a four-day journey in an open boat in the Andaman Sea, she was taken to Charlie&apos;s Inn, a seedy fisherman&apos;s bar and brothel in Ranong. There, she was beaten repeatedly until she agreed to have sex with clients. It was only when the Thai police raided the brothel several months later that Toe Toe realised she had not been in Bangkok after all. But by then, of course, it was too late: she had contracted HIV. Even today, Toe Toe is reluctant to speak about her ordeal. She explains that when neighbours discovered she was taking medications for Aids they shunned her, driving her from her village. It is only when Du Boisrouvray arrives, prompting a flood of tears followed by much hugging, that Toe Toe agrees to tell me her story. She is not the only victim. Sitting beside her are Marwei, 48, who was also sold to a sex ring by &quot;friends&quot; and ended up in another brothel in Ranong, and Zar Ni, the only woman who admits trading sex for money willingly. Caught up in the same Thai police raid, all three were taken to a women&apos;s shelter in Bangkok. To this day, they will never forget the moment Du Boisrouvray walked in and shared a meal with them. &quot;You were so beautiful, so young,&quot; Toe Toe tells her. &quot;We thought you were an angel. Do you remember how at the end we all stood up and applauded you?&quot; It is a testament to FXB&apos;s advocacy \u2013 among its other duties, FXB helps secure antiretroviral medications for women and children enrolled in its programmes \u2013 that of the 50 who tested positive for HIV in 1992, half are still alive. One of those who did not make it is the mother of Kyaw Shan. Now aged 13, he lives with his father in a monastery and has a permanent air of sadness. Like many orphans of the epidemic, he is himself HIV positive. The only moment he smiles is when he is embraced by an 18-year-old volunteer called Yie Tone. Yie Tone, I notice, wears her hair short and dresses like a boy. It is only later that I learn her mother died of HIV when she was 12 and that soon after her stepsister tried to sell her to a sex ring. Luckily, she was able to seek sanctuary with FXB. Her dream now is to become a human rights lawyer. If it was Toe Toe and her co-workers who first brought Du Boisrouvray to Burma, it is for Kyaw Shan, Yie Tone and all the other invisible victims of the epidemic that she has continued working with the regime. It hasn&apos;t been easy. In 1996, for instance, she was banned from entering the country after writing a critical article in the New York Times. In 2003, with the accession to the prime minister&apos;s office of Khin Nyunt, who despite being the then chief of military intelligence was considered a moderate, she was allowed to return, but a year later Khin Nyunt was deposed by conservative elements in the junta and access again became difficult. Despite whoever has been in power, however, Du Boisrouvray says she has always been able to find people sympathetic to her cause and to this day she is on first-name terms with two former health ministers. In the past, she would never have visited Nay Pyi Taw, not because the trip would have been hard to arrange but, she says, because in those days she did not want to be seen to be supporting the regime. Now that things appear to be opening up, she feels the generals deserve to be given the benefit of the doubt &quot;This is not a time to criticise the junta,&quot; she says. &quot;Instead, let&apos;s support them and see how far they are prepared to take the reforms.&quot; Although the press is still subject to censorship, more and more stories are being passed and those who can afford internet charges no longer find access to the BBC and dissident news sites blocked. The next test is the parliamentary elections in two weeks. While there are 48 seats up for grabs on 1 April the vote is not expected to alter the balance of power because under the constitution the military is entitled to a quarter of the seats in the lower house and the remainder are dominated by the main pro-military party. That is why veteran Burma watchers believe the real test will come later this year when the NLD and other independent parties begin to flex their muscles and demand changes to the constitution. No matter who takes power the country faces big challenges. Although the incidence of HIV in Burma is lower than in many parts of Africa, the UN estimates there are currently some 120,000 Burmese living with HIV, of whom only a third are receiving antiretroviral drugs, leaving some 80,000 without access to vital medications. To make matters worse, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis is rampant, greatly complicating treatment protocols. The crisis can be clearly seen at the M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res drop-in clinic in northern Rangoon where doctors only have the capacity to treat the most critical cases. Everyone else is simply turned away. &quot;It&apos;s very demoralising,&quot; says Peter Paul de Groote, MSF Burma&apos;s head of mission. &quot;In some cases, we are talking about people with full-blown Aids. It&apos;s like the 1980s all over again.&quot; The tragedy is that with annual spending on health at the equivalent of 50 cents per person \u2013 one of the lowest in the world \u2013 Burma does not have the capacity to close the treatment gap, and with the next funding round of the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria currently suspended there seems little prospect of western donors making up the shortfall in the near future. All the more reason, says Du Boisrouvray, why she is determined to remain in Burma and continue working with the regime. &quot;Toe Toe knows that theoretically she should have died a long time ago in that brothel. The tragedy is she is still dependent on us for medicines and support and the same is true for many of the other women. FXB is their family.

Now it has gone to court to fend off claims from the fashion house Louis Vuitton that the sequel to Todd Phillips&apos;s 2009 sleeper hit, about a group of friends who travel to Thailand for a highly eventful stag do, created consumer confusion by depicting a counterfeit handbag branded a &quot;Lewis Vuitton&quot;. Warner representatives last week told a New York federal court that its use of a fake bag made by the Chinese-American company Diophy, which Louis Vuitton is also suing, was justified by a 1989 US court decision in which Hollywood star Ginger Rogers was denied compensation over a film about two fictional Italian cabaret performers who recreated her routines with Fred Astaire for comedy effect.            The offending bag appears in a scene from last year&apos;s The Hangover II, which features a stag do in Bangkok, riffing off the capital&apos;s widespread counterfeit culture. Zach Galifianakis&apos;s Alan is roughly handed the item, and responds: &quot;Be careful, that is \u2026 that is a Lewis Vuitton.&quot; Warner says the earlier case over the film Ginger and Fred, which the court ruled was &quot;an exercise of artistic expression rather than commercial speech&quot;, gives it protection against the Louis Vuitton suit, and adds that the fashion house is misinterpreting trademark law. &quot;The issue is the freedom of the author to incorporate references to real life \u2013 including references to trademarks and even to counterfeit goods \u2013 in creating the expressive work,&quot; Warners&apos; lawyers said in a motion to dismiss. &quot;The ownership of a trademark confers many rights but not the right to alter or veto such creative expression.&quot; Other suits to hit The Hangover Part II include one from tattoo artist S Victor Whitmill, who created the original Maori-inspired tattoo for Mike Tyson that was reproduced in a scene in which Stu (Ed Helms) wakes up after a night of drunken debauchery to discover he has an identical design on his face. The studio later said it would digitally alter the design for the DVD release, but this was avoided after they settled with Whitmill for an undisclosed amount. In October, producers also faced a plagiarism suit from screenwriter Michael Alan Rubin, who said The Hangover Part II was based on his idea for a comedy in which the main character travels from America to Asia to wed his girlfriend. It was later dismissed. The studio also settled with stuntman Scott McLean, who claimed he suffered brain trauma during a stunt gone wrong. Louis Vuitton is asking for compensation over the use of the &quot;Lewis Vuitton&quot; bag in The Hangover II, which grossed \u00a3367m and is the most successful R-rated comedy of all time at the global box office.

Pop sensation Turbo Music is so young she still has braces on her teeth, but that doesn&apos;t stop myriad middle-aged men from clawing at her legs and private parts, eager to put paper bills anywhere their fingers might reach. This is modern Thailand: a nation home to the first-ever airline staffed by ladyboys, the highest number of sex-change surgeries worldwide and a seeming openness to sex rarely seen \u2013 or enjoyed \u2013 anywhere else in the world. But ask a local teen how to put on a condom, or the ways in which HIV is contracted, and you will likely be met with a blank stare and shy giggle. Despite an education system that has created one of Asia&apos;s highest rates of literacy, Thailand has the second-highest number of teen pregnancies in the world, the highest rate of HIV/Aids in Asia, and year-on-year increasing rates of STD infection among its youth. The country&apos;s &quot;top-down control of thoughts and behaviour&quot; in its schools is partly to blame, says Bangkok-based blogger Kaewmala, author of Sex Talk, which analyses Thai culture and sexuality. &quot;Sex isn&apos;t always a taboo subject in Thai culture ... [But] what is &apos;appropriate&apos; is often narrowly and strictly defined by those who aren&apos;t always in touch with reality.&quot; Last year it was Turbo Music&apos;s single Itchy Ear that drew attention to the divide between Thailand&apos;s hyper-eroticised image and its surprisingly conservative culture. With lyrics describing a bodily &quot;itch&quot; desperate for a scratch and a YouTube video watched over 17m times, the band \u2013 and its message \u2013 attracted a flurry of criticism about &quot;amoral Thai behaviour&quot; and the &quot;taboo nature&quot; of sex in Thai culture. This year, it was an claim by the National Economic and Social Development Board that Facebook was partly to blame for the country&apos;s unwanted teen pregnancies, citing seducing messages and video clips as an issue. Then there was a nationwide health exam for high school students that asked: &quot;If you have a sexual urge, what should you do?&quot; Optional answers included: a) Ask friends if you can play football together; b) Consult family members; c) Try to sleep; d) Go out with a friend of the opposite sex; or, e) Invite a close friend to watch a movie together. The correct answer, according to Dr Samphan Phanphrut, director of the National Institute of Educational Testing Services, which oversees the exam, was (a): Ask friends if you can play football together, whether the exam taker was a boy or girl. The question, he told local media, was intended to verify students&apos; ability to recognise \u2013 and act \u2013 on their sexual impulses. Copies of the test posted online quickly attracted messages of outrage and chagrin, with commentators lamenting the lack of parent-child dialogue on sex and the state of the country&apos;s education system \u2013 sentiments that some politicians echo. Dr Pusadee Tamthai, of Thailand&apos;s National Commission for Women&apos;s Affairs, says the indirect wording of the question, coupled with its many possible answers, only proved educators&apos; inability to reach their students. &quot;Children are growing up so much faster today than in the past, but because sex is taboo in Thailand, they seldom learn about sex from their parents or family, so they depend on magazines, the internet and their friends for information,&quot; she says. &quot;When they do learn about sex at school, the way that students communicate with their teachers is hierarchical and [therefore] not very open, because in our culture of respecting the elderly there&apos;s an emphasis on taking care of what you say rather than talking freely and without judgment.&quot; Luckily, there are some educators in Thailand who are listening. Maytinee Bhongsvej, executive director of the Association for the Promotion of the Status of Women, has launched a frank approach to sex education in the capital, where a comprehensive programme \u2013 encompassing self-esteem, bodily and emotional changes, gender rights, STDs and intercourse \u2013 has been rolled out to some 100 schools around Bangkok. The course, she says, far surpasses the &quot;sperm and ovary&quot; biology focus of the national curriculum and \u2013 despite being highly controversial \u2013 has met with great success anecdotally. &quot;People think that if you talk about sex, you encourage them to have it. But if you keep preaching &apos;Maintain your virginity&apos;, you don&apos;t prepare kids for reality,&quot; she says. &quot;We believe that kids should be fully informed because then they can avoid situations that would lead them to problems.&quot; Tamthai, who hopes to see a programme like Maytinee&apos;s as part of the national curriculum one day, is restrained in her hope. &quot;That starts with being honest with each other,&quot; she says, &quot;and that&apos;s a lot to do.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-03-20T14:00:45Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Sex"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/20/thailand-struggles-teach-sex-education", "title": "Thailand struggles to teach the basics of sex education to students", "sentences": ["The country&apos;s &quot;top-down control of thoughts and behaviour&quot; in its schools is partly to blame, says Bangkok-based blogger Kaewmala, author of Sex Talk, which analyses Thai culture and sexuality.", "Maytinee Bhongsvej, executive director of the Association for the Promotion of the Status of Women, has launched a frank approach to sex education in the capital, where a comprehensive programme \u2013 encompassing self-esteem, bodily and emotional changes, gender rights, STDs and intercourse \u2013 has been rolled out to some 100 schools around Bangkok."]}, {"article": "This was an exceptional week for Guardian journalism.

Todd Phillips also revealed the new film will be released in May 2013 and will feature all four original cast members. &quot;We&apos;re going to surprise a lot of people with the final chapter we have planned,&quot; Phillips said. &quot;It will be a fitting conclusion to our three-part opera of mayhem, despair and bad decisions.&quot; The first Hangover film was the sleeper hit of 2009 and went on to become the highest-grossing R-rated comedy of all time in the US. Its 2011 sequel, The Hangover Part II, shifted the stag-do antics of bachelor quartet Phil Wenneck, Stu Price, Alan Garner and Doug Billings from Las Vegas to Bangkok and once again broke box-office records. However, it could not repeat the first film&apos;s positive critical reception, with reviewers complaining that the storyline amounted to little more than an unimaginative retread of part one. Film-makers have hinted that the third film will switch the action to Los Angeles and introduce a radically different formula. But given that the first and second movies made $467.5m and $581.5m respectively worldwide for studio Warner Bros, Phillips may find himself under pressure not to deviate too far from the tried and tested, memory-loss-meets-carnage blueprint. The director, who is currently working on the screenplay with Hangover Part II writer Craig Mazin, gave little away in his statement. Hollywood trade sites speculated earlier this year that the lead trio of Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis and Ed Helms might be set for $15m paydays if they signed on for a third instalment. No word yet on whether there is a place on the cast list for those two favourites from the earlier films, Mike Tyson, who played himself, and Ken Jeong, who portrayed flamboyant gangster Leslie Chow. Hollywood is notoriously slippery when it comes to producing final instalments in successful series. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade proved errantly monikered when Harrison Ford returned, almost two decades later, as the heroic archeologist in 2008&apos;s poorly received Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The Alien series even survived the death of its central protagonist, Ellen Ripley returning as a clone in 1997&apos;s ill-fated Alien: Resurrection despite having previously been killed off in David Fincher&apos;s 1992 third instalment.

In a co-ordinated series of events at UN offices in New York, Geneva, Nairobi, Santiago de Chile and Bangkok and at the Commonwealth headquarters in London, representatives of the three global professional bodies will celebrate the worldwide contribution of social work and social development professionals to tackling the social challenges of individuals and communities. A new joint statement, launched today The Global Agenda for Social Work and Social Development: the Commitments, will be received in New York, Geneva and London. The week has seen a coordinated programme of events in social work agencies, universities and voluntary organisations around the world. In the UK there have been events in Belfast, Perth, Cardiff and Stoke-on-Trent with a parliamentary reception in Westminster. This week of hectic activity is the outcome of a determined global programme designed to raise the self-confidence, morale and influence of the social work profession around the world in a decade-long strategy lead by the International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW), International Association of Schools of Social Work (IASSW) and International Council on Social Welfare (ICSW). These bodies shared the frustration of social workers and social development professionals all around the world that their work often went unrecognised and the profession lacked the respect of politicians. This will seem a familiar scenario to UK social workers. Almost 10 years ago the three organisations recognised their responsibility not only to provide visible global leadership but also to reposition the social work profession as making a visible and strategic contribution to addressing the growing world social crisis. They decided to hold joint, biannual world conferences and agreed to link these events to a global agenda-building process. Consultation through member organisations and on the web was launched in 2008 leading up to the Hong Kong conference in 2010, attended by 3,000 participants. The outcome of the consultation and the conference was the first iteration of the agenda highlighting four key themes: social and economic inequalities within countries and between regions; dignity and worth of the person; environmental sustainability and the importance of human relationships. A further round of open consultation culminated in a meeting in Ghana in November 2011, resulting in the document launched this week. The 2012 world conference on social work and social development being held in Stockholm in July, supported by the Guardian, is entitled The Global Agenda: Action and Impact, turning the focus on implementation and action. In 2010, Helen Clark, the third most senior official in the United Nations and former prime minister of New Zealand, called on social workers to speak up, get involved with the UN agendas and to challenge inequality and injustice. &quot;There are so many complementarities and synergies between the UN agenda and the work of social workers; we must find better ways to work together,&quot; she said. Two years later, the challenge has been met.

In the past decade, there has been significant political progress in moves to implement a system that ensures children with disabilities have access to mainstream schools. However, with cultural barriers and resistance from some headteachers, the journey towards fully inclusive education has only just begun. &quot;Even when I offered to work for free, they still could not be convinced,&quot; explains Paul Lennon, a British ex-pat whose son was born with Down&apos;s syndrome. When he started looking for mainstream schools for his son in Chanthaburi province six years ago, headteachers in the local area refused him a place. Yet the National Educational Act, passed in 1999 \u2013 and accompanied by posters declaring: &quot;Any disabled person who wishes to go to school can do so&quot; \u2013 supposedly guaranteed all disabled children access to state education. Some headteachers Lennon spoke to were amenable to the concept of inclusive education, but didn&apos;t feel they had the resources or training to implement it effectively. Others, with decades of experience of working in special schools, felt this institutional model was more suitable. The education act did have some success. Between 2000 and 2004, the number of students with disabilities accessing education increased from 145,000 to 187,000. These students were taught at more than 18,000 inclusive schools, defined by the government as those that teach children with and without disabilities. There was further legislative progress with the Education Provision for People with Disabilities Act, passed in 2008, which made it illegal for schools to refuse entry to children with disabilities. After much perseverance in securing a school place for his son, Lennon turned his attention to helping other children gain access to inclusive education by helping to set up the Good Child Foundation. Nanthaporn (Nuey) Nanthamongkol, a six-year-old girl with Down&apos;s syndrome, was due to be sent to a distant boarding school before he intervened. &quot;Without our work, Nuey would have been separated from her parents, sent to a school 80km away,&quot; says Lennon. &quot;For kids with Down&apos;s syndrome, this is the worst possible thing you could do.&quot; Nuey&apos;s story also highlights the cultural complexities of disability in Thailand. Sermsap Vorapanya, who is the author of A Model for Inclusive Schools in Thailand and has conducted a study on Thai inclusive education practices, explains: &quot;It is critical to understand that most Buddhists [in Thailand] believe in reincarnation. Disability is widely viewed as a deserved failure to lead positive previous lives.&quot; Theravada Buddhist teaching on rebirth led some families to report feeling shame about having a disabled child. However, many headteachers in Vorapanya&apos;s study cited the Buddhist belief in the need for compassion as a reason they support inclusive education. Meanprasat private school in Bangkok, which combines western-style &quot;child-centric&quot; learning with a Buddhist ethos of moral ethics and regular meditation, is recognised as a national leader in integrated educational practices. In total, 130 of its 1,300 students are disabled. The school&apos;s philosophy is that children with disabilities &quot;should have the chance to mix with society and be accepted by it&quot;. More than 5,000 teachers visit the school annually and attend workshops held to help spread good practice. State schools, however, which have much less funding, have been described by Vorapanya as having &quot;woefully insufficient resources&quot; to implement inclusive education properly. Headteachers have complained that while schools can now access a minimum of 2,000 baht (approximately \u00a341) funding for each disabled child, this is not enough to cover the required resources or training expenses. Another problem is that this funding can only be given if the child has been officially certified with a disability. Teachers have reported that some parents do not want this social stigma or are fearful that this certification will lead to discrimination. Despite the significant challenges, Lennon is optimistic. &quot;We are making great strides,&quot; he says. &quot;If we keep doing good, the results will surely follow.&quot; Chanthaburi province is moving away from the special schools model, placing students with moderate special needs in mainstream schools. Lennon helps place volunteers in local schools with children with Down&apos;s syndrome, and is working with local government to demonstrate how this practice can be replicated across the province. Inclusive education remains in its early development stages in Thailand. But, as Vorapanya says, the country has &quot;made a great beginning&quot; to a monumental task.", "publicationDate": "2012-03-27T13:03:27Z", "tags": ["Global development", "Universal primary education", "Thailand", "World news", "Disability"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/mar/27/thailand-first-steps-inclusive-education", "title": "Thailand takes first steps on long road to inclusive mainstream education", "sentences": ["Meanprasat private school in Bangkok, which combines western-style &quot;child-centric&quot; learning with a Buddhist ethos of moral ethics and regular meditation, is recognised as a national leader in integrated educational practices."]}, {"article": "Over eight days and for more than 200 hours of continuous broadcasting, The Spirit of Schubert is currently eclipsing all else on Radio 3.

Her book was crowned winner of the Diagram prize following a public vote, beating an array of oddments including Mr Andoh&apos;s Pennine Diary: Memoirs of a Japanese Chicken Sexer in 1935 Hebden Bridge; The Great Singapore Penis Panic and the Future of American Mass Hysteria; and Estonian Sock Patterns All Around the World, to win the award. &quot;Given that this year the three most voted-for works contain the words &apos;poo&apos;, &apos;sexer&apos; and &apos;penis&apos; in the title, it appears that this year&apos;s prize will go down in history as a blue year,&quot; said the award&apos;s custodian, Horace Bent. &quot;But there is nothing wrong with that. Many of the world&apos;s greatest writers have dabbled in off-colour humour, so I find Cooking with Poo a fitting winner.&quot; There is no prize for the author of the winning title \u2013 instead The Bookseller magazine, which runs the award, usually gives a bottle of &quot;fairly passable plonk&quot; to whoever spotted the title. As Cooking with Poo was &quot;unearthed indirectly via Twitter&quot;, however, the magazine will be making a donation to Urban Neighbours of Hope, a charity that helped create Diwong&apos;s cookery programme. Diwong may find winning the Diagram award brings other benefits: previous recipient Michael Young, author of Managing a Dental Practice the Genghis Khan Way, said it had the unlikely effect of increasing his literary clout. &quot;Since the award of the prize, I am pleased to say that my writing career is once again flourishing. Editors are keen to publish my words,&quot; he said. &quot;Being the winner of the Diagram prize has, I feel, given both the book and me a great deal of credibility, which perhaps without the epithet &apos;prize-winning&apos; we would never have achieved.&quot; The award has been running since 1978, when it was conceived at the Frankfurt book fair and given to Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Nude Mice.

The crucial question for all of us, because we share the planet, is whether that will result in an equitable, sustainable future or, as Smith speculates, growing inequality and persistent poverty, at the same time as resource profligacy. This is surely the central agenda for the Rio+20 and the post-2015 millennium development goals. The demographic transformation that typifies development, urbanisation, has yet to take hold in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 only Lagos approaches megacity status of 10 million people. The Chinese are, it seems, leading the way in infrastructure-led assistance, and this points to the urgent need for the international aid programme as a whole to look ahead, beyond the food crises, to building the capacity of African governments to plan for and manage the growth of cities. Unless they do, the high levels of mortality and of ill health will simply be reproduced in the future slums and sprawl.Neil BlackshawLittle Easton, Essex \u2022 While it is commendable to talk up the prospects for Africa, as the traditional image of a hopeless continent is no longer justified or helpful, the figure of 34% of all Africans being middle class, as used by Mthuli Ncube, chief economist of the African Development Bank, is deeply misleading. It is true, the continent is booming, with some of the highest growth figures on the planet, but this growth sits firmly on the back of natural resources, such as oil and minerals, that foreigners are extracting and shipping abroad. When one knows that the African Development Bank sees the consumption of $2 a day as the threshold of middle class, and that roughly one-quarter of all Africans have yet even to have electricity, one can get a better picture of the reality. That there is a surge in optimism in African capitals is undeniable; the challenge is to support governance and regulatory systems (such as anti-corruption and tax-evasion legislation) that will enable Africa&apos;s wealth of natural resources to actually reduce poverty rather than, as is more traditional, increase it.Peter HudsonDirector, Rainbow Development in Africa  \u2022 Your report (29 March) on the losses faced by Lloyd&apos;s of London after an &quot;unprecedented series of natural disasters&quot; rightly noted the impact of several major events in 2011, including the Japan tsunami, the earthquake in New Zealand and floods in Australia and Bangkok. This is a powerful illustration of a world where natural disasters and humanitarian emergencies are becoming the norm. However, the crisis which affected the largest number of people last year was the drought in east Africa, affecting over 11.5 million people in one of the poorest regions of the world. None of these 11.5 million people were insured at Lloyd&apos;s of London, and many are trying to rebuild their livelihoods with no financial support beyond that provided by charities like Cafod. The rich have the option of insurance to help mitigate the impacts of natural disasters. The poor do not. We must not abandon them because of this, nor break our promises to support them.Mike Noyes Head of humanitarian programmes, Cafod \u2022 Last week&apos;s report on aid from the House of Lords (Abandon 0.7% international aid target, peers tell ministers, March 29) makes recommendations which could seriously undermine the reputation of the UK government as one of the world leaders in poverty reduction. The suggestion that the Department for International Development should consider how Britain could derive direct economic benefit from its development aid is incompatible with this success, and would ultimately mean that UK aid was able to help fewer of the people who need it, and deliver poorer value for money for British taxpayers. The report states that it is not possible to increase the amount of aid at the same time as improving its quality, but DfID has already proven that it is able to scale up its investments while also leading the world in terms of aid effectiveness. Aid helps to ensure that the world&apos;s most disadvantaged people are able to access health, education and other essential services to help them build a brighter future. Spending this small percentage of 0.7% on development is a pledge we have made and one we can and must afford to keep.Caroline HarperChief executive, Sightsavers \u2022 Gordon Peters (Letters, 22 March) says Eritrea deserves a better press. I heartily agree. It has an extraordinary landscape, a perfect climate, a fascinating history, and a resilient and wonderful population. However, President Isaias, who rules Eritrea, deserves all the bad press he gets. Isaias has locked up all independent journalists, all opposition politicians and many evangelical Christians. There have been no democratic elections since independence. He has expelled all international NGOs. Any remaining independent observers (such the international diplomatic community) have been prevented from travelling outside the capital to assess the impact of the recent drought which has devastated the Horn of Africa. The British military administration in Eritrea ended 60 years ago. In this anniversary year, it is all the more appropriate that Isaias gets the bad press he deserves in the UK. Will Cobbett London \u2022 Characteristically, the Department for International Development reverts to its default position in the face of criticism of the aid budget. That position is known as shroud-waving \u2013 &quot;250,000 newborn babies will die needlessly&quot; \u2013 has long been discredited in Whitehall negotiations and is better known as bureaucratic blackmail. The House of Lords committee is surely correct to ask for greater accountability and might query why the Afghan government, long known as the recipient of huge sums of DfID largesse in the name of &quot;capacity building&quot;, should still be an international byword for corruption? Perhaps the Lords might care to add a footnote to their report urging that some of the planned DfID budget increase should be diverted to the BBC World Service to make good the grievous cuts it suffered in the last spending round. Who doubts that the BBC World Service is the finest, most effective form of international aid?

Incremental change wins Apple big gains &gt;&gt; TidBits Glenn Fleishman:  Those competing with Apple have to advertise every new device and computer as being substantially different enough to justify a quicker upgrade cycle. If Apple makes $400 from a low-end MacBook Air that might be in use for five years, and Dell makes $50 (after paying Microsoft for Windows) for a low-end laptop, how quickly does Dell need to sell that person another device? During those five years, Apple might get $29 two or three times for updates to Mac OS X; Dell gets nothing from any Windows upgrades. Apple may also now reap additional dollars from Mac App Store purchases, too. Dell? Nothing.  Intriguing argument which implies that Dell has to keep growing even to survive - though of course for Dell having a big installed base to pick from *should* mean it would reach a point where constant renewal of machines guarantees a given revenue and profit.

It was the morning after a protracted night of drinking, walking and discovering and as I sweated off the alcohol in this stylish Asian-themed sauna in a sprawling spa resort. This wouldn&apos;t be unusual in Bangkok, or even Berlin, but my hedonistic destination of choice was one of Europe&apos;s least-known capitals, Luxembourg City. The tiny independent sovereign state is quietly attempting to join the list of European short-break destinations. And why not? It has more Michelin stars per head than any other European country, and the high proportion of foreign residents and visitors ensures a cosmopolitan atmosphere. There&apos;s a surprising number of stylish places to stay, eat and party and the compact city of less than 90,000 people is gently nudging things along with a new policy of free entry to its nightclubs and bars. There is also a novel way of getting home at the end of the night: a minibus that serves as a cross between a bus and taxi, Nightrider (+352 9007 1010, nightrider.lu) operates from 6pm till 5am on Friday and Saturday nights and will pick you up and drop you to your door for a fraction of the price of a taxi (from \u20ac3 a head for a party of four). You can also still smoke indoors, which may be enough of a draw for some \u2013 it certainly creates a decadent atmosphere in these strait-laced times. The heart of Luxembourg City is essentially a giant old fortress, a plateau protected by sheer cliffs. Much of it is pedestrianised and Place d&apos;Armes, the square in the heart of town, is a good place to orient yourself. The old town is chocolate boxy and upscale, and the main square is overlooked by a new, staggeringly opulent, designer hotel \u2013 Hotel Le Place d&apos;Armes (hotel-leplacedarmes.com, doubles from \u20ac320). But I was really visiting the city to test what the nightlife has to offer. The old town was the obvious place to start, and I persuaded Brian, an Irish journalist and long-time resident, to show me around. Urban City (6 rue de la Boucherie, urban.lu) is a popular drinking spot near the Ducal palace, crammed with multilingual natives and work-hard-play-hard expats. After a pint or two, we left in search of more space and quiet. We eschewed the old town&apos;s glitzy clubs and bars and headed for the Grund, a warren of narrow streets on the banks of the Alzette river. With the old town and the cliffs illuminated, it was as atmospheric as Prague with a hint of Paris&apos;s Left Bank. Caf\u00e9 Des Artistes (22 Mont\u00e9e du Grund), slightly above the Grund, is an intimate bar with an old piano and a languid atmosphere that apparently (although not the night we were there) bursts into spontaneous sessions of whatever is the Luxembourgish equivalent of chanson. It was a great place to people-watch thanks to the bohemian crowd and some bottles of local beer.     Decibel rock bar, Luxembourg    Grund is also home to Mosconi, which has two Michelin stars (13 rue Munster, +352 54 6994, mosconi.lu). Its pasta tasting menu (eight courses, \u20ac72) looked tempting but the prices were strictly expense account-only. From the Grund, it was a short but hilly stroll to Rives de Clausen (rue Emile Mousel, rivesdeclausen.eu). This recently converted brewery has become a major nightlife centre, with a host of bars, restaurants and clubs thronged with Luxembourg&apos;s young and beautiful people. In complete contrast, round the corner is the homely restaurant Mousel&apos;s Cantine (46 Mont\u00e9e de Clausen, +352 47 0198, mouselscantine.lu, mains \u20ac17-\u20ac25), which serves comforting Luxembourgish specialities such as judd mat gaardebounen (smoked collar of pork with broad beans, \u20ac19.50). Rue de Hollerich, a short cab ride away in the south of the city, is the home of the edgier end of Luxembourg nightlife. At numbers 42-44, bars and nightspots are clustered around a small courtyard. We started in The Lab, which is where things began to get blurry. It had a long, dark bar with fluorescent green lighting and a medical theme, with shots in test tubes and oxygen on tap. It was a few steps across the courtyard to Decibel (decibel.lu), a rock bar with friendly Irish owners and draught Guinness. While Luxembourg is by no means a Berlin-style nest of debauchery, the city&apos;s small size, safety and beauty makes it ideal for nocturnal wandering from venue to venue. But perhaps it&apos;s the sheer number of foreigners in the city (37% of the country&apos;s population are immigrants) that makes it welcoming to the casual visitor. On our night out, Brian and I fell into conversations with strangers everywhere we went. I recovered the next day at Domaine Thermal (+352 2366 6666, mondorf.lu), a 20-minute bus ride from the city in Mondorf-les-Bains. The spa has an outdoor-indoor thermal mineral bath heated to a blissful 36C. You can&apos;t wallow for too long \u2013 20 minutes maximum is recommended \u2013 but there is a complex of saunas (which is where the previously mentioned nudity and gong banging took place), steam rooms and even more pools. At \u20ac32, day membership for the spa is great value.     Luxembourg's Casemates fortifications. Photograph: Getty Images    Luxembourg City has some formidable tourist attractions, such as the Casemates du Bock, a warren of defensive tunnels dug into the rock, and the futuristic Mudam art museum (mudam.lu). But the countryside was calling and I spent my last day touring the gently rolling hills of the Ardennes, a 45-minute drive to the north, with a friend. We ended up in the otherwise unremarkable village of Redange, which has been put on the map by a thriving music venue. L&apos;Inou\u00ef Caf\u00e9-Theatre (67 Grand-Rue, Redange, +352 2662 0231, inoui.lu) is firmly part of the European jazz circuit and is the heart of a mini-empire, publishing a magazine and hosting a theatre school. It&apos;s this incongruity that makes Luxembourg so appealing. A few hedonistic days in the Grand Duchy will overturn the stereotype of a boring country of bankers and Eurocrats. Here you can have an unusual party weekend, with great food and post-party pampering, in a city that is easier to navigate than Paris or Berlin. \u2022 Ryanair (ryanair.com) flies from Stansted to Frankfurt Hahn from \u00a314 return, then get a shuttle bus (flibco.com) to Luxembourg City, from \u20ac10 return.

They moved upwards, she says, along her legs, winding the tape around and around, binding her to the stretcher. They taped her stomach, her arms and then her chest. She was bound tight, unable to move. Bouchar says there were three Americans: two tall, thin men and an equally tall woman. Mostly they were silent. She never saw their faces: they dressed in black and always wore black balaclavas. Bouchar was terrified. They didn&apos;t stop at her chest \u2013 she says they also wound the tape around her head, covering her eyes. Then they put a hood and earmuffs on her. She was unable to move, to hear or to see. &quot;My left eye was closed when the tape was applied,&quot; she says, speaking about her ordeal for the first time. &quot;But my right eye was open, and it stayed open throughout the journey. It was agony.&quot; The journey would last around 17 hours. Bouchar, then aged 30, had become a victim of the process known as extraordinary rendition. She and her husband, Abdel Hakim Belhaj, a Libyan Islamist militant fighting Muammar Gaddafi, had been abducted in Bangkok and were being flown to one of Gaddafi&apos;s prisons in Libya, a country where she had never before set foot. However, Bouchar&apos;s case is different from the countless other renditions that the world has learned about over the past few years, and not just because she was one of the few female victims. Documents discovered in Tripoli show that the operation was initiated by British intelligence officers, rather than the masked Americans or their superiors in the US. There is also some evidence that the operation may have been linked to a second British-initiated operation, which saw two men detained in Iraq and rendered to Afghanistan. Furthermore, the timing of the operation, and the questions that Bouchar&apos;s husband and a second rendition victim say were subsequently put to them under torture, raise disturbing new questions about the secret court system that considers immigration appeals in terrorist cases in the UK \u2013 a system that the government has pledged to extend to civil trials in which the government itself is the defendant. This year, the Crown Prosecution Service announced police had launched an investigation into the &quot;alleged rendition and alleged ill-treatment&quot; of Bouchar and Belhaj, and a second operation in which a Libyan family of six were flown to one of Gaddafi&apos;s prisons. It appears inevitable that Scotland Yard&apos;s detectives will want to question the man who was foreign secretary at the time \u2013 Jack Straw. Ten years before Bouchar&apos;s abduction and rendition, many of her husband&apos;s associates had been permitted to settle in Britain. These men were members of al-Jama&apos;a al-Islamiyyah al-Muqatilah fi-Libya, the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), an organisation formed in the early 1990s and dedicated to Gaddafi&apos;s removal. The LIFG was not banned in the UK, and its members appear to have found the country a convenient place to gather and raise funds. There were even reports \u2013 officially denied \u2013 that MI6 encouraged the LIFG in an unsuccessful attempt on the dictator&apos;s life. But from 2002 the UK ceased to be such a safe haven for the LIFG. The US and UK governments were beginning to repair their relations with Gaddafi, a rapprochement that would soon see him abandon his WMD programme and open his country&apos;s oil and gas reserves to western corporations. Held by armed police One Thursday evening in November that year, a 36-year-old LIFG member who was living in London was arrested by armed police as he attempted to board a flight at Heathrow. He was told he was being detained under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act, a piece of legislation that had been rushed on to the statute books within weeks of 9/11, and which allowed the British government to detain international terrorism suspects without trial. From that moment the man was anonymised, by court order \u2013 in part to protect his relatives in Libya \u2013 and could be referred to only as &quot;M&quot;. When M had arrived in the UK as an asylum seeker eight years earlier, he had readily told Special Branch detectives that he was a member of the LIFG. On his arrest at Heathrow he insisted that the organisation had no connection with international terrorism and was concerned only with the removal of Gaddafi. After being detained at Belmarsh high security prison in south-east London, M appealed to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC), a tribunal that allows the government to give evidence in secret, unseen by the appellant or the appellant&apos;s lawyers.     Abdel Hakim Belhaj in Tripoli in August 2011 where he was the rebel military leader. He had been detained in 2004 in Bangkok and rendered to Libya with his pregnant wife Fatima Bouchar. Photograph: Francois Mori/AP    In March 2004, M became the first and only person detained under the act to win an appeal at SIAC. The tribunal accepted that there were no links between LIFG and al-Qaida, and criticised the Home Office for its &quot;consistent exaggeration&quot; of M&apos;s alleged links with members of al-Qaida. As the law permitted only &quot;international terrorists&quot; to be detained without trial, and not domestic insurgents, M was set free. A few days after SIAC&apos;s decision, notice was passed to the Home Office and MI5, and Fatima Bouchar and her husband were detained in Bangkok. Bouchar&apos;s husband made no secret of being a leading member of the LIFG. That year, the couple had left China, where they had been living in exile, and attempted to travel to the UK via Malaysia. When they were detained in Kuala Lumpur and questioned about Belhaj&apos;s false Iraqi passport, an acquaintance went to the British high commission to explain that the couple were attempting to reach London. Shortly after this, they were told that they would be permitted to travel to the UK on a BA flight, despite not having EU passports or UK visas. But when the aircraft stopped off at Bangkok, the pair were detained and taken to a US-run detention facility. It was known that the CIA had been operating a secret prison in Thailand since 9/11, but its precise location was unknown. Bouchar and Belhaj arrived there within minutes of being detained, suggesting that it was located within the perimeter of Don Muang international airport. They were immediately separated. Belhaj says he was blindfolded, hooded, forced to wear ear defenders, and hung from hooks in his cell wall for what seemed to be hours. He says he was severely beaten. The ear defenders were removed only for him to be blasted with loud music, he says, or when he was interrogated by his US captors. Bouchar says that when she was dragged away from her husband she feared he was going to be killed. &quot;I thought: &apos;This is it.&apos; I thought I would never see my husband again ... They took me into a cell, and they chained my left wrist to the wall and both my ankles to the floor. I could sit down but I couldn&apos;t move. There was a camera in the room, and every time I tried to move they rushed in. But there was no real communication. I wasn&apos;t questioned.&quot; Bouchar found it difficult to comprehend how she could be treated in this way: she was four-and-a-half months pregnant. &quot;They knew I was pregnant,&quot; she says. &quot;It was obvious.&quot; She says she was given water while chained up, but no food whatsoever. She was chained to the wall for five days. At the end of this period she was taped to the stretcher and put aboard the aircraft, unaware of where she was going or whether her husband was on board. At one point the aircraft landed, remained on the ground for a short period and then took off again. Only when it landed a second time did she hear a man grunting with pain, and realise her husband was nearby. Belhaj says he had been shackled to the floor of the plane, with his hands chained to his feet in a manner that made it impossible either to sit or lie down. Sometimes his grunts would be met with a kick; on other occasions, he says, a cushion would be placed under his elbows, giving him temporary respite before it was taken away again. The plane touched down at Tripoli with its cargo still trussed up; a gift, apparently, to the regime they had hoped to overthrow. The pair were driven separately to Tajoura prison, east of the city, and Bouchar was led to a cell where she would spend the next four months. Initially, she was interrogated for around five hours a day. &quot;At one point a cot was brought in the cell along with some baby clothes, nappies, a bed cover and a baby bath,&quot; she says. &quot;I really thought I was going to have to have my baby there, and that we would both be held there. Bouchar was released shortly before giving birth to a son, apparently because word of her husband&apos;s capture had reached the outside world. Belhaj was brought to her cell for a few moments, and then she was set free, though not permitted to leave the country. Two weeks after the couple were rendered to Libya, Tony Blair paid his first visit to the country, embracing Gaddafi and declaring that Libya had recognised &quot;a common cause, with us, in the fight against al-Qaida extremism and terrorism&quot;. At the same time, in London, the Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell announced that it had signed a \u00a3110m deal for gas exploration rights off the Libyan coast. Three days after that, a second leading LIFG member, Abu Munthir al-Saadi, was bundled aboard a plane in Hong Kong and taken to Tripoli in a joint British-Libyan rendition operation. Saadi&apos;s wife and four children were also kidnapped and taken to Libya. The youngest was a girl aged six. The family was incarcerated at Tajoura for more than two months before being released. Saadi and Belhaj were held for more than six years, however, and say they were subjected to torture throughout this time. At one point, they say, early in their incarceration, they were interrogated by British intelligence officers after being tortured by the Libyan captors. These visitors wanted to learn more about LIFG members living in the UK. The two men say their torturers had made clear that their treatment would improve if they told the British that these LIFG activists were linked with al-Qaida: something that SIAC had ruled, just weeks earlier, was not the case.     The flight plan for the 2004 rendition operations found in Moussa Koussa's office.     The role that MI6 played in arranging the rendition of these two Libyan dissidents and their families is now well known, thanks to a discovery made last September by Peter Bouckaert, a director with Human Rights Watch, inside the abandoned office of Moussa Koussa, Gaddafi&apos;s foreign minister and former intelligence chief. Bouckaert found a file containing hundreds of secret letters and faxes that MI6 and the CIA had sent to Koussa during the early days of the rapprochement between Libya and the west. Among them were a series of documents detailing the 2004 rendition operations. A close examination of those papers show that a great deal of planning went into the operations, withMI6 informing Koussa&apos;s office as early as November 2003 that they were seeking the assistance of Chinese intelligence officers in their attempt to deal with &quot;the Islamic extremist target in China&quot;. When MI6 learned that Belhaj was being held in Malaysia under his nom de guerre, Abdullah al-Sadiq, along with his pregnant wife, they were quick to tip off Tripoli. Notoriously, perhaps, one fax from Mark Allen, then head of counter-terrorism at MI6, congratulated Koussa on the &quot;safe arrival&quot; of Belhaj \u2013 &quot;the least we could do for you and for Libya&quot; \u2013 and referred to an &quot;amusing&quot; request by the CIA that anything the dissident said under interrogation should be passed first to them. &quot;I know I did not pay for the air cargo,&quot; Allen says: but after all, the intelligence that led to the couple&apos;s rendition was British. Another fax, sent by the CIA two days before Blair&apos;s visit, with a cover sheet marked &quot;rendition of Abu Munthir&quot;, shows the US to be eager to join and finance that operation after learning that MI6 and Gaddafi&apos;s government were about to embark upon it. Also buried away inside the secret document cache is a fax that shows MI6 felt itself not to be bound by the anonymity order imposed after M had been detained under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act in November 2002. The following January, the intelligence service sent Koussa what it described as an MI5 &quot;intelligence resum\u00e9&quot;, detailing M&apos;s full name and date of birth and disclosing that he was an active member of the LIFG. The fax also listed the Libyan telephone numbers called by M. It was being sent, MI6 explained, &quot;for research purposes and analysis purposes&quot;. By piecing together records of air traffic control logs and matching them with a document found in the Tripoli cache, it is possible to trace the route taken by the aircraft that rendered Bouchar and Belhaj from Bangkok to Tripoli in March 2004. There are a couple of surprises along the way. The aircraft was a Boeing 737 with the tail number N313P, operated by a North Carolina company called Aero Contractors, which has been widely reported to be a CIA front. N313P is now known to have been used in a great many rendition operations: it was one of the aircraft that carried a shackled and hooded Binyam Mohamed, for example. According to the records of the European air traffic management agency, Eurocontrol, and the Federal Aviation Administration in the US, N313P took off from Dulles airport in Washington DC at 2.51am on 7 March 2004, landing at Misrata in Libya shortly after noon local time. When N313P departed from Misrata, it flew beyond Eurocontrol&apos;s area of responsibility, and disappears, temporarily, from its records. But a flight plan had been prepared by the CIA the previous day, and faxed to Libya, where it was found among the secret cache of letters and faxes recovered from Koussa&apos;s office. This document shows that after leaving Libya, the rendition aircraft planned to stay overnight on the Seychelles before continuing to Bangkok. It was then due to leave Bangkok on the evening of 8 March, the date that Bouchar and Belhaj were forced on board an aircraft.The CIA flight plan shows that the aircraft was then due to fly to Tripoli via Diego Garcia, where it would refuel during the early hours of 9 March. Any evidence that the rendition plane landed on Diego Garcia would be enormously damaging for the British government. Although the remote coral atoll in the Indian Ocean is operated as a US military outpost, it is a British Overseas Territory, and the UK is legally responsible for events there. The last Labour government was highly sensitive to reports that Diego Garcia played a part in the global rendition programme. Both Blair and Straw insisted on a number of occasions that there was &quot;no evidence&quot; for this. Those assurances proved to be wrong: in February 2008, amid mounting evidence that rendition aircraft had landed on the atoll, David Miliband, one of Straw&apos;s successors at the Foreign Office, told the Commons that he was &quot;very sorry indeed&quot; to report that two rendition flights had refuelled there in 2002. By way of reassurance, Miliband told MPs that no prisoners had been allowed to disembark while the aircraft were refuelled, and that &quot;US investigations show no record of any other rendition through Diego Garcia or any other overseas territory, or through the UK itself, since then&quot;. Diego Garcia question When the CIA flight plan was recovered from Koussa&apos;s office, the Guardian asked the Foreign Office whether the plane carrying Bouchar and Belhaj had indeed stopped off on Diego Garcia, despite Miliband&apos;s assurances. The department sought initially to imply that the aircraft had been refused permission to land, but would not answer the question directly. Asked for a yes-or-no answer, a spokeswoman declined. In any case, by the evening of 9 March, N313P had reappeared on the radar of Eurocontrol. The agency&apos;s records show the aircraft landed once more at Misrata airport: the exact place that the CIA flight plan said it would be. On board were Bouchar, taped to her stretcher, and Belhaj, still shackled in an excruciating stress position at the end of their 17 hour flight. With its prisoners rendered and the Libyan mission accomplished, N313P left for Palma de Mallorca. Hotel records from the five-star Gran Melia Victoria, a favoured destination for rendition teams, show that the crew of 10 men and three women booked in for two nights of rest and recreation. Curiously, however, when the aircraft left Palma on the evening of 11 March, it did not return to the US. Instead, it flew east to Baghdad. After less than two hours on the ground in Baghdad, it departed for Kabul. N313P remained in Kabul for 24 hours, then flew back to Washington via Larnaca on Cyprus and Shannon on the west coast of Ireland. The flight to Kabul appears to coincide with another British-initiated operation, one that saw two more people being subjected to extraordinary rendition, this time from Iraq to Afghanistan. Yunus Rahmatullah and Amanatullah Ali were two Pakistani men suspected of having travelled to Iraq to fight for al-Qaida. MI6 is understood to have tracked them as they travelled across Iran and into Iraq, and when they arrived at a house in southern Baghdad, a decision was taken to raid the building, a mission codenamed Operation Aston. SAS troopers attacked the house in late February, shooting dead two men and capturing several others. After the detainees were handed over to the US military, Rahmatullah and Ali were held at a prison at Baghdad international airport, according to a British military source. Then they were flown to Afghanistan and taken to the US-run prison at Bagram, north of Kabul, a transfer that was in breach of the Geneva conventions. They remain at Bagram today, despite an attempt to secure the release of Rahmatullah by persuading the appeal court in London to grant a habeas corpus writ. The SAS troops who took part in Operation Aston were members of a joint US-UK special forces task force that rounded up large numbers of people in Iraq, missions in which the US was, on every other occasion, deemed legally to be detaining authority. But former members of the taskforce say Operation Aston was an all-British affair, and they were never sure why. The Guardian has asked the Foreign Office on several occasions whether N313P flew Rahmatullah and Ali to Afghanistan, but the department has always failed to answer. The following year, 2005, the LIFG was banned in the UK, and a number of its members, including M, were arrested. The Home Office said it had taken this step because it had come to the conclusion that the group was &quot;part of the wider global Islamist extremist movement, as inspired by al-Qaida&quot;. To what extent this assessment drew upon intelligence provided by Gaddafi&apos;s government \u2013 including statements made by LIFG prisoners under interrogation \u2013 remains unclear. What is becoming clear, however, is that the rendition of Abdel Hakim Belhaj and Abu Munthir al-Saadi had a number of unintended consequences. By early 2005, the British government had been forced to conclude that the capture of the more moderate elements among the LIFG leadership, such as Belhaj and al-Saadi, had resulted in a power vacuum that was being filled by men with pan-Islamist ambitions. Among a number of documents found in a second Tripoli cache, at the British ambassador&apos;s abandoned residence, was a secret 58-page MI5 briefing paper that said &quot;the extremists are now in the ascendancy,&quot; and that they were &quot;pushing the group towards a more pan-Islamic agenda inspired by AQ [al-Qaida]&quot;. The realisation that MI6 had passed M&apos;s name and information about his contacts to Gaddafi&apos;s notorious intelligence agencies, despite the existence of an order seeking to preserve his anonymity, provoked outrage among lawyers who work within the SIAC system. There was also dismay at the manner in which the rendition operations were mounted shortly after SIAC had ruled that there were no links between the LIFG and al-Qaida. M&apos;s lawyer, Gareth Peirce, believes that to be one of the reasons the two men were taken to Libya. &quot;The UK&apos;s complicity in the renditions of Belhaj and Abu Munthir is sickening,&quot; Peirce says. &quot;Their synchronisation with the obtaining of perceived missing &apos;intelligence&apos; for domestic proceedings damns both enterprises equally.&quot; Last December, the attorney general, Dominic Grieve, wrote to the head of Scotland Yard, Bernard Hogan-Howe, drawing his attention to the two rendition operations. A few weeks later the Yard announced it was mounting a criminal investigation, which is continuing. Meanwhile, no attempt is being made to deny MI6 involvement in the renditions: instead, well-placed sources say the operations were &quot;ministerially authorised government policy&quot;. This has led to reports that police will need to interview Jack Straw. The Guardian has repeatedly put a number of questions about the renditions to Straw, asking whether he authorised the operations and, if not, which minister was responsible; the former foreign secretary has repeatedly declined to answer. A further consequence is that lawyers representing the rendition victims are suing MI6, MI5, the foreign office, and Mark (now Sir Mark) Allen. Belhaj \u2013 who was released from prison along with Saadi in 2010 \u2013 led the militia that drove Gaddafi&apos;s forces out of Tripoli last year, and is now settled in the city with Bouchar. They embarked on legal proceedings only after the UK government declined to offer them an apology. Bouchar appears to remain deeply traumatised by her abduction and imprisonment, and that of her husband. &quot;The time around the birth of a first child should be among the happiest in a couple&apos;s lives,&quot; she says, &quot;but it is very difficult for me to look back at that time because I wanted to die rather than be going through what I did.&quot; Happily, she is now pregnant with the couple&apos;s second child. Asked whether it wished to say anything that would help explain the UK government&apos;s role in the rendition operations, the Foreign Office declined to comment. The justice ministry, meanwhile, is pressing ahead with proposed legislation that would introduce SIAC-style secrecy to any civil trial or inquest in which a minister has decided that some evidence is too sensitive to be aired in public. Bouchar&apos;s lawyers condemn not only her mistreatment, but the plans to force litigation on her behalf into secret court hearing. Sapna Malik, of the law firm Leigh Day, says: &quot;Fatima&apos;s utterly barbaric treatment, and Britain&apos;s role in it, must come under the full scrutiny of an open court and not be condemned to a secret chamber.&quot; Cori Crider of the legal charity Reprieve, which is also representing her, added: &quot;It is bad enough that MI6 and the CIA had Abdel Hakim Belhaj tortured, when his only opponent was Colonel Gaddafi, but it is impossible to see what they hoped to achieve by kidnapping his pregnant wife, taping her up and forcing her on a plane back to Libya. &quot;Instead of saying sorry, the security services are busily trying to shunt Fatima&apos;s case and those like it into secret. Make no mistake: when Ken Clarke says a &apos;tiny&apos; category of national security cases will be heard in closed court, it is Fatima, taped to the stretcher, he and those behind him have in mind.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-04-08T15:26:58Z", "tags": ["Rendition", "Libya", "MI6", "CIA", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa", "MI5", "UK news", "US news", "World news", "Human rights", "Law", "Abdel Hakim Belhaj"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/08/special-report-britain-rendition-libya", "title": "Special report: Rendition ordeal that raises new questions about secret trials", "sentences": ["She and her husband, Abdel Hakim Belhaj, a Libyan Islamist militant fighting Muammar Gaddafi, had been abducted in Bangkok and were being flown to one of Gaddafi&apos;s prisons in Libya, a country where she had never before set foot.", "He had been detained in 2004 in Bangkok and rendered to Libya with his pregnant wife Fatima Bouchar.", "A few days after SIAC&apos;s decision, notice was passed to the Home Office and MI5, and Fatima Bouchar and her husband were detained in Bangkok.", "But when the aircraft stopped off at Bangkok, the pair were detained and taken to a US-run detention facility.", "By piecing together records of air traffic control logs and matching them with a document found in the Tripoli cache, it is possible to trace the route taken by the aircraft that rendered Bouchar and Belhaj from Bangkok to Tripoli in March 2004.", "This document shows that after leaving Libya, the rendition aircraft planned to stay overnight on the Seychelles before continuing to Bangkok.", "It was then due to leave Bangkok on the evening of 8 March, the date that Bouchar and Belhaj were forced on board an aircraft.The CIA flight plan shows that the aircraft was then due to fly to Tripoli via Diego Garcia, where it would refuel during the early hours of 9 March."]}, {"article": "It was the most unlikely place to find a copy of James Brown&apos;s The Popcorn. Pinned clumsily to a wall in one of the many antique shops in Sana&apos;a, Yemen&apos;s capital, hung the creased sleeve of a rare LP that contains some of Brown&apos;s funkiest moments. To stumble across it here defied logic, but was, it turned out, the kind of inconsistency that is happily commonplace in Yemen. I have always collected records; for me, it&apos;s one of the most reliable ways of interacting with new situations, surroundings and people. I realise this is anachronistic in an age of torrents and high-speed downloads, but it is inspired by one simple fact: there is still so much 20th-century music that lies undocumented. By day I work as an NGO consultant, and over the years have trawled the streets of Addis Ababa, Bangkok, Hanoi, Jakarta and Rangoon, often with my portable turntable in tow, looking for vinyl. As well as new music (and old), it has led to conversations and experiences that would otherwise have alluded me. Everyone has heard of Yemen, but lately not a lot about its music or culture (the resignation of President Saleh in November last year and subsequent violence have, naturally, dominated the headlines). But the country is home to one of the oldest civilisations in the Near East and stakes a claim, along with Ethiopia, to be the birthplace of coffee. Aden, on the south coast, was once one of the busiest sea ports in the world. In\u00a0Sana&apos;a&apos;s old city, with its ancient box-like architecture and labyrinthine back streets, there are jewellery hawkers, henna and spice sellers; there is the smell of incense, grilled meat and the sweet sting of qat, the privet-like leaf that acts as a slow-release amphetamine when chewed. I knew nothing about Yemeni music, but began by asking shop owners if they had any old records; within a short time I had made contact with a small circle of locals keen to help, frankly amused by my fixation. The best examples of local music I found were the 45rpm singles, often in a sorry condition. These featured hypnotic melodies, usually played on the oud, backed by percussion and topped off by heartfelt vocals that drew on Yemen&apos;s long poetic tradition. On a first listen, they reminded me of old blues records. The heavy percussion and rhythmic string-picking in some of the songs belies the fact that the east African coast is only 20 miles away across the Red Sea; in many ways, Yemen is closer to countries such as Somalia and Ethiopia than to its peninsula neighbours, Oman and Saudi Arabia.       One track I found, Ya Man Dakhal Bahr al-Hawa [Hey, Who Enters the Sea of Passion?] by Fatimah al-Zaelaeyah, is accompanied by drumming on a copper tray (a sahn suhasi), a sound that starts to take on an almost industrial feel as the groove evolves.       The male/female duet Mushtaq, by Bobol al-Hejaz and Soni Ahmed, is a sensual rumination on love and life, with an arpeggiating oud\u00a0melody and a wonderful, head-nodding rhythm.       Wahed Mozawag by Mohammed Hamood al-Awani has all the joy and exuberance of the local wedding music \u2013 which I was lucky enough to witness, running into a traditional procession one afternoon. As well as the Yemeni and other Arabic discs, I found plenty of vinyl from the old eastern bloc. Soviet pressings of Paul McCartney, Polish jazz and Russian-language courses or propaganda LPs (My Boundless Motherland was my personal favourite) cropped up with some regularity. (The USSR was present through Marxist elements in Yemen&apos;s National Liberation Front, which partly\u00a0forced the exit of the British in southern Yemen in 1967; this area of the country became a further arena for cold war machinations.) In Aden, once a fuelling stop for the East India Company, I found a large pile of Bollywood EPs. Yemenis occasionally make the journey east, so possibly these discs had been stowed away on a return trip. Most of the Yemeni songs I came across were about love; the poetry that inspired them would often be recited during qat-chewing sessions. Astounded by qat&apos;s ubiquity, I spent one evening chewing through a small bag of the plant, whilst listening to my recent vinyl purchases, hoping to find a portal\u00a0into the national psyche. I can&apos;t\u00a0say that happened, but I did experience a dual feeling of being entirely relaxed yet entirely alert for the duration. Qat is not just a narcotic \u2013 it&apos;s an arbiter of disputes, and a conduit for community discussions. It is also, shockingly, a consumer of 80% of the country&apos;s water. (This fact alone would appear to give weight to the misgivings of the stuffy scientist played by Ewan\u00a0McGregor in Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m&apos;s forthcoming Salmon Fishing in the\u00a0Yemen, in which a government employee helps a local sheikh realise his dream of introducing fly-fishing to the country.\u00a0With Yemen&apos;s propensity for curveballs, one could never rule out such a project.) Sadly, I had to leave James Brown where he was: the owner wanted an unrealistically high price for it. But I did get my turntable out and play it for him and his friends. Clyde Stubblefield&apos;s thunderous rhythms rattled around the shop, and were met with smiles, nods and an admission that this was the first time they had heard such music. It was a nicely surreal moment, and one that James Brown will now always summon to mind for me.", "publicationDate": "2012-04-08T17:00:01Z", "tags": ["Pop and rock", "World music", "Soul", "Yemen holidays", "Music", "Culture", "Vinyl"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/08/record-hunting-yemen", "title": "Record-hunting in Yemen", "sentences": ["By day I work as an NGO consultant, and over the years have trawled the streets of Addis Ababa, Bangkok, Hanoi, Jakarta and Rangoon, often with my portable turntable in tow, looking for vinyl."]}, {"article": "MI6 and former Labour ministers are facing fresh pressure over Britain&apos;s involvement in the rendition of a prominent Libyan dissident as it emerged that the government is offering him more than \u00a31m in compensation for being brutally treated by Muammar Gaddafi&apos;s secret police. The government has offered the money to Abdel Hakim Belhaj in a move that would avoid MI6 appearing in open court, where it would face the prospect of explaining its role and that of ministers, the Guardian has been told. Leigh Day, lawyers for Belhaj, who was appointed head of Tripoli&apos;s military council after the Libyan revolution, have served a claim on Sir Mark Allen, the MI6 officer at the centre of the affair. They are suing Allen, then the most senior officer in MI6 responsible for counter-terrorism, alleging &quot;complicity in torture&quot; and &quot;misfeasance in public office&quot;. They have filed a separate claim against the Commissioner for the British Indian Ocean Territory. A plane taking Belhaj and his wife Fatima Bouchar to Libya in 2004 is understood to have landed for refuelling at the US base on Diego Garcia. Belhaj says he was told by Moussa Koussa, then head of Libyan intelligence, that the stopover in Diego Garcia \u2013 en route from Bangkok where he was seized, to Tripoli \u2013 happened with British permission. In a letter to Koussa, dated 18 March 2004, discovered in a bombed Tripoli building, Allen said: &quot;I congratulate you on the safe arrival of Abu Abdullah al-Sadiq [a name used by Belhaj]. This was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over the years.&quot; A few days later, Blair visited Gaddafi in a highly-publicised meeting. Whitehall officials have repeatedly defended MI6&apos;s actions, saying Britain&apos;s foreign intelligence agency was following &quot;ministerially authorised government policy&quot;. Officials say that ministers were consulted about the rendition of Libyan dissidents. They also say that the Gaddafi regime gave assurances that the dissidents would not be mistreated if Britain handed them over. Belhaj, his wife, and Sami al-Saadi, another Libyan dissident, have described how they were mistreated, in claims that could have serious implications for British officials and former Labour ministers alike. Jack Straw, who at the time was foreign secretary, said after the discovery of the Allen letter: &quot;We were opposed to unlawful rendition. We were opposed to any use of torture. Not only did we not agree with it; we were not complicit in it and nor did we turn a blind eye to it.&quot; However, he added: &quot;No foreign secretary can know all the details of what its intelligence agencies are doing at any one time.&quot; Though he has said he was &quot;always happy to deal with any questions relating to his time as home secretary or foreign secretary&quot;, he has declined to comment further on the Libyan renditions. It remains unclear precisely what MI6 told Straw, or any other minister, about the operation, and whether Gaddafi&apos;s officials gave assurances that they could not honour. These questions may never be answered. British officials have said that Belhaj&apos;s civil case could have been heard in secret courts, now being proposed by the government, had they been in place then. The courts would hear evidence from MI6 and MI5, but only so long as the information was never disclosed. Asked about the reports, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the former Conservative foreign secretary who chairs the parliamentary intelligence and security committee, told the BBC: &quot;I think one&apos;s entitled to be extremely uneasy. &quot;It&apos;s very, very worrying indeed, because if [Belhaj] was rendered to Libya and if the UK intelligence agencies and the UK government were involved, that is not only contrary to the policy the British government has pursued for a long number of years, but also to the assurances that were given to the intelligence and security committee and to parliament as a whole.&quot; On whether the intelligence agencies got authority from the government, &quot;that&apos;s how [they] normally resolve the problem&quot;, Rifkind said. Seeking government authority normally involved ministers, he continued. If ministers were consulted and gave their approval then they &quot;must ultimately take responsibility,&quot; Rifkind added. A government spokesman said: &quot;A police investigation is underway, so we are unable to comment. [The government] will co-operate fully with investigations into allegations made by former Libyan detainees about UK involvement in their mistreatment by the Gaddafi regime.

The quake&apos;s centre was 20 miles beneath the ocean floor and about 308 miles from the provincial capital of Banda Aceh, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). It was initially reported as being of 8.9 magnitude but was downgraded shortly after it hit. A 6.5-magnitude aftershock has since been reported. Traffic jams were reported in Aceh, where people scrambled for higher ground as sirens mingled with sounds from the mosques, Reuters reported. A rescue team from Indonesia&apos;s disaster mitigation agency was sent to the region to help. Officials in the neighbouring countries of Thailand, Malaysia and India issued precautionary evacuation orders along coastal regions. Thailand temporarily closed Phuket airport, according to local media, with warnings of waves up to 4 metres (13ft) in height hitting the holiday islands of Phuket and Krabi, although no tsunami waves have yet been reported. Tremors, some lasting for as long as five minutes, were felt across south-east Asia after the earthquake hit. Reports on Twitter described employees rushing out of office buildings and families looking for safety as far away as Rangoon, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Singapore, India and Sri Lanka. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre (PTWC) said an alert had been issued for 28 countries, including Indonesia, Bangladesh, Iran and Oman. An updated warning said sea-level readings indicated that a tsunami measuring 17cms (6.7ins) had been generated but that if no major waves had occurred &quot;for at least two hours after the estimated arrival time, or damaging waves have not occurred for at least two hours, then local authorities can assume the threat is passed&quot;. It warned, however, that damage to boats and coastal structures could continue, owing to rapid currents. The PTWC lifted the tsunami warning for most areas of the Indian Ocean about four hours after the first quake. Bruce Presgrave of the USGS told the BBC a destructive tsunami was less likely because the quake had been caused by the earth moving horizontally instead of vertically. Indonesia sits above the ring of fire, a series of fault lines which make the archipelago nation of roughly 18,000 islands prone to volcanic and seismic activity. The 9.1-magnitude quake that occurred on Boxing Day 2004 triggered a tsunami in the Indian Ocean that killed 230,000 people, nearly three-quarters of whom were in Aceh.

The claim was that MI6 rolled the pitch for Tony Blair&apos;s bizarre 2004 hug-in with Libya&apos;s Colonel Gaddafi by apparently arranging for the CIA to kidnap Gaddafi&apos;s opponent in exile, Abdel Hakim Belhaj. He was seized in Bangkok, where he and his wife were en route to Britain. It&apos;s been suggested they were &quot;rendered&quot; via the British colony of Diego Garcia to Tajoura jail in Tripoli. Belhaj spent six years, and his wife four and a half months, at the tender mercies of Gaddafi&apos;s security boss, Moussa Koussa. Belhaj&apos;s pregnant wife was taped like a mummy on a stretcher, and he was systematically tortured. Koussa himself denies any involvement in torture. With this gift came a covering letter from MI6&apos;s Mark Allen, offering Koussa congratulations on the &quot;safe arrival&quot; of the &quot;air cargo [Belhaj]. This was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over the years.&quot; Within two weeks Gaddafi was welcoming a fawning Blair in his famous desert tent, and announcing that he would abjure terrorism and set aside his &quot;planned&quot; weapons of mass destruction. The plans were spurious, but the deal allowed Blair to walk tall in Washington at a time when the Iraq invasion was turning sour. Less spurious were other elements in\u00a0the strange relationship. It was claimed Britain would not just deliver Belhaj but lift sanctions. Gaddafi would greet BP&apos;s Lord Browne, accompanied by Allen, who switched with full ministerial approval from being an MI6 officer to a \u00a3200,000 special adviser to BP. When, three years later, the \u00a315bn deal with BP\u00a0seemed to falter, it&apos;s claimed Allen pressed his old boss, Jack Straw, to release Libya&apos;s Lockerbie bomber, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi. Allen was a senior adviser to Monitor consultancy, which helped boost Gaddafi&apos;s world image, and assisted the London School of Economics, on whose advisory board Allen sat and where Gaddafi&apos;s son Saif was receiving a much-heralded PhD. The new chairman of BP was none other than Sir Peter Sutherland, also chairman of the LSE. When, in 2011, Gaddafi&apos;s regime was visibly tottering, Britain coolly deserted him. Sanctions were reimposed, but no one thought to tell Nato special forces, present at the fall of Tripoli, to find and secure the building in which the incriminating documents lay. Presumably to the horror of MI6, Human Rights Watch got there first and found Allen&apos;s letter, which was handed to journalists. To make things worse, Belhaj was now out of jail and head of Tripoli&apos;s military council. Worse still, his old nemesis, Koussa, had shrewdly defected as Gaddafi crumbled and was able to confirm Belhaj&apos;s suspicions of British complicity in his fate. Belhaj is not a man to hide a grievance and is now suing Allen and the British government for &quot;complicity in torture&quot; and &quot;misfeasance in public office&quot;. He has reportedly been offered and refused \u00a31m from the British government to shut up. As a tale of panic and cock-up it beats Smiley&apos;s People. MI6 puts out the usual line that it only follows &quot;ministerially authorised government policy&quot;. The relevant ministers at the time were Straw and Blair, who should have been fully briefed in 2004 on Gaddafi&apos;s apparent U-turn and the reasons behind it. Both men have denied knowledge of Belhaj&apos;s rendition and torture, or the suggestion that it and Megrahi&apos;s release were a quid pro quo for oil. Both have plaintively remarked that ministers may be responsible yet cannot know everything. In Allen&apos;s defence, it can be said that he was doing exactly what his masters so badly wanted. Blair in 2004 was craven to Washington, desperate to win a spur in George Bush&apos;s crusade against militant Islamism. At the time, CIA rendition flights were criss-crossing the world with Muslims bolted to the floor. A couple more as a gift to a kindly dictator seemed small beer. As for whether Allen mentioned it to Straw, known to be supporting his bid to head MI6, neither he nor Straw is telling. On Monday the foreign secretary, William Hague, grasped at the straw of Belhaj&apos;s law suit in declining to comment. He said, with a broad smile, that the whole matter was &quot;sub judice&quot;. The implication, that his remarks might prejudice a trial, was that this would be held in public. But these are precisely the cases that the cabinet now wants to ensure are conducted in secret. The morass now thickens. On 22 February, the court of appeal in London showed itself equally mesmerised by the &quot;war on terror&quot;. It upheld the conviction of a London university student, Mohammed Gul, for disseminating &quot;terrorism&quot; over the internet. Not content with imprisoning the pathetic and repentant Gul for five years, their lordships felt an urge to political theory. They declared that the war on terror embraced not just Gul but &quot;acts by insurgents against the armed forces of a\u00a0state anywhere in the world which sought to influence a government and were made for political purposes&quot;. Under legislation, terrorism included not just acts of violence but any threat made for &quot;the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause&quot;. These threats might include nothing more than a &quot;serious risk to public health and safety&quot; or &quot;seriously to disrupt an electronic system&quot;. From this catch-all lexicography, dissidents and insurgents under any regime were not excluded. Their lordships noted that it seemed there was nothing that would exempt those engaged in attacks on the military during the course of insurgency from the definition of terrorism. It was hard luck all Kurds, Kosovans, Benghazians, Tibetans and Iranian exiles \u2013 and today&apos;s Syrian rebels. They are all terrorists. This is ridiculous. Gul&apos;s Bin Laden fantasies were not remotely in the same boat as Belhaj&apos;s opposition to Gaddafi. Yet both were seized as terrorists and imprisoned by agents of British government. They are joined in judicial calumny with millions round the world who are struggling against dictatorial regimes and willing harm to their &quot;armed forces&quot;. Every student agitator is a terrorist, every internet hacker, cafeteria dissident, freedom fighter and insurgent leader. The war on terror is corrupting all it touches, while parliament meekly passes each twist of the ratchet of repression. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 April 2012.

At the very least, you could give yourself a serious ache in the brain. Because although the barest of summaries \u2013 say, &quot;Barton is a battling midfielder with a troubled past and a mammoth Twitter following&quot; \u2013 doesn&apos;t come near to capturing the complexity of either his character or of our reaction to him, probing further leads you into decidedly muddied waters: into a personal and professional history studded with exhaustively documented controversies, from minor spats to serious violence, and a present in which @Joey7Barton&apos;s rapidly evolving persona attracts more column inches than his performances on the pitch. It leads you down tributaries in which our obsession with contemporary football seems riddled with class confusion, latent aggression and barely concealed schadenfreude. And it leads you back to a man intent on telling you that whatever you thought you knew about him is probably wrong. Even his name. &quot;Joey&quot;, he tells me when we meet for the first time, is just a &quot;stage-name&quot;, something that got scribbled on a team-sheet early on in his career. Friends and family call him Joe, and he also seems fond of Joseph, which goes nicely with the retro-Brilliantine look currently enjoying a minor vogue among Premier League footballers \u2013 you can imagine Barton and Scott Parker, for example, kissing their sweethearts goodbye before jumping into their Spitfires and Hurricanes, though the quiffed hairdo might owe just as much to Barton&apos;s love of Morrissey. In any case, Joe/Joseph/Joey is exceptionally pleasant in the flesh: funny, engaged, unstoppably chatty, entirely free from any of the puffed-up nonsense you might assume comes with millionaire-sportsman territory. Physically, he has a sort of wiry poise, often standing on the balls of his feet, but there is also something diffident, almost shyly polite, about him. When two young women, hardly able to speak for coy giggles, approach our table for autographs and a photo, my reflex is to wonder whether some nutty rule about image rights will get in the way; Joey just puts down his fish-finger sandwich, smiles sweetly and asks: &quot;Is it Jemma with a J?&quot; All the subjects that I&apos;d envisaged requiring a certain delicacy to bring up \u2013 his stint in jail, his alcoholism, his notorious altercations with team-mates, his rows with successive clubs \u2013 rise to the surface with ease, usually brought there by him. But we begin with Twitter. He first appeared on the social-media site last August and, until his self-imposed &quot;Twitter sabbatical&quot; last month, tapped out 4,598 tweets. He has used his break, which followed a fairly rocky period on the pitch, to work on his new website, which he will launch in the next few weeks. During those eight months on Twitter, Barton amassed a cool 1,366,505 followers (he himself only follows 105 people). The numbers don&apos;t tell the whole story, which is that he has constructed (aided, of course, by journalists and commentators quick to spot a good story) a\u00a0highly distinctive identity. He&apos;s waged wars \u2013 most noticeably with the powers-that-be at his former club, Newcastle United, which he left on a free transfer to Queens Park Rangers last summer. In November, he challenged the club&apos;s managing director, Derek Llambias, to take a lie detector test to establish who was telling the truth about his departure and issued a further warning to Llambias and, one presumes, club owner Mike Ashley: &quot;If he&apos;s worried now, him and his fat mate should be sh*tting it, if I decide to write a book. There&apos;ll be no holding back on those 2 muppets.&quot; (NB, Llambias and Ashley: Barton is indeed writing his autobiography, with Times columnist Matthew Syed.) Also in his sights are the game&apos;s governing body (&quot;Just received my weekly warning letter from the FA headquarters&quot;); and the likes of Alan Sugar, former QPR manager Neil Warnock and the entire cast of TOWIE. The hashtag #helmets often follows tetchy and occasionally vindictive swipes at his detractors. He&apos;s also involved himself with campaigns he feels strongly about, including a concerted call for signatories for the e-petition to force the government to release documents relating to the Hillsborough disaster, and he nearly fell foul of the attorney general when he tweeted extensively about the John Terry race row. And he&apos;s become known for a variation of what we might call Cantona&apos;s Seagulls: that moment when a sportsman \u2013 and particularly a footballer \u2013 dares to say something more elaborate than: &quot;I thought the lads showed a lot of heart out there today.&quot; Setting the tone early on \u2013 &quot;Sitting eating sushi in the city, incredibly chilled out reading Nietzsche #stereotypicalfootballer&quot; \u2013 the 29-year-old Barton demonstrated an interest in philosophy, politics, literature and art so at odds with our previous conceptions of him that it was even suggested someone else was tweeting on his behalf.           In fact, he nearly gave the whole thing a\u00a0miss. After months of just watching, he tells me, he thought: &quot;No, not for me, I think I&apos;m just too honest. It&apos;d be like giving an arsonist a box of matches, me being on there. This could be really dangerous for me.&quot; What changed his mind, he explains, was wanting to be seen as someone other than &quot;a monosyllabic Neanderthal who fights in city centres, drunk&quot;. &quot;For a long, long time I&apos;d been portrayed as a certain type of person by the media and, of course, with certain elements of my character, they totally give them the ammunition. But I\u00a0also felt that they were coercing me into being something that I wasn&apos;t, and maybe if I did 15 good things, they&apos;d wait for the negative to say, &apos;Oh hang on, look he actually does fit the stereotype, he is the token bad boy of English football\u2026&apos; And I just got pissed off with it, really. I started thinking about how you&apos;d be remembered and what I\u00a0wanted to stand for, or what people would actually say when I wasn&apos;t in the room.&quot; One thing you could say about Joey, in or out of the room, is that he&apos;s a pretty combative guy. One of his favourite words is &quot;smite&quot;, as in someone (often a sportswriter) &quot;having a smite&quot; at him. Twitter, he argues, allows him to &quot;smite&quot; back. He remembers telling one journalist to, &quot;Say what you want, your industry&apos;s dying and history&apos;s written by the victors&quot;, and &quot;Your shitty newspaper columns, no one will remember them&quot;. &quot;And they hated it,&quot; he tells me. &quot;They would do,&quot; I reply. The &quot;elements&quot; of his character that have provided the &quot;ammunition&quot; go beyond the traditional boozed-up footballer snapped out on the razzle with a glamour model the night before a big game. Over the past decade or so, as Barton progressed from Manchester City to Newcastle United to QPR, with a single England cap in 2007, a series of violent confrontations has blighted his career, earning him a reputation as a player with an uncontrollable temper (as he puts it, &quot;the anti-Christ&quot;). In 2004, he stubbed a cigar out in the eye of City colleague Jamie Tandy at the club&apos;s Christmas party; the following year, he was found guilty of gross misconduct after a disturbance in Bangkok with a\u00a0teenage Everton fan. Then there was a training-ground altercation in 2007 with team-mate Ousmane Dabo, for which Barton received a four-month suspended sentence for actual bodily harm. And most seriously of all, he was found guilty of assault and affray following a\u00a0fight outside a branch of McDonald&apos;s in Liverpool, a conviction that led to him spending 74 days in prison in 2008. What was shocking about each of these events was not that a testosterone-fuelled, highly athletic young man with a short fuse got into a\u00a0fight, but the severity of his reaction and the fact that he seemed to learn little from each incident. Talking to him about it now is a\u00a0strange experience. On the one hand, he&apos;s keen to set some kind of record straight, explaining in detail the context that he feels went unreported, particularly the extent to which he was reacting to provocation. But just at the moment you feel he&apos;s missing the point \u2013 the newspapers, after all, didn&apos;t put him in prison \u2013 he begins to talk about what happened with an almost unnerving openness and gravity. He describes growing up in Huyton, Merseyside, an environment in which aggression was the norm. &quot;Where I&apos;m from,&quot; he says, &quot;if you said something to someone in the pub, they&apos;d smash a glass over your head, or stab you or shoot you or you&apos;d get beaten up.&quot; (This is not just swagger: Barton&apos;s brother Michael, after all, is currently serving a minimum of 17 years in prison for his part in the racially motivated murder of Anthony Walker in 2005. Barton, who had not lived with his brother since he was 14, when their parents split up, refused his brother money in the aftermath of the crime and publicly urged Michael to give himself up to the police.) At 17, Barton was earning \u00a3300 a week \u2013 roughly the same as his dad. But football doesn&apos;t work like most of the rest of the world, with small fillips of achievement and good fortune and incremental rises in income. Before long, his pay was six grand a week, more than everyone in his family combined: &quot;I&apos;d go to nightclubs and queue up with my mates when I was on \u00a3300 a week, then all of a sudden everyone was giving me everything, I could walk to the front of nightclub queues, everyone knew who I was.&quot; Barton rarely draws breath during conversation, but he pauses as he considers what that felt like. &quot;Hard to remain sane. Hard to remain balanced.&quot; He began drinking, despite the fact that he didn&apos;t really like it. &quot;I was a 22-year-old lad, I had 40,000 fans going to the game, and if I\u00a0didn&apos;t play well, I was under this enormous pressure. And the only way I could deal with it, the only form of escapism, the only way I\u00a0could get in touch with my inner self, who I\u00a0remembered from before I was famous\u2026 &quot;Everyone was looking at me and judging me I\u00a0felt. I&apos;d walk into a room and everyone would know who I was and I&apos;d never know who they were, and this paranoia set in. And the only way I\u00a0could escape that was by getting pissed. I\u00a0hated drinking. Even to this day, I don&apos;t like the taste of drink, I never have done, but I\u00a0loved feeling drunk\u2026 the pressure would go, and then the likelihood was I&apos;d wake up next morning and I&apos;d done something stupid, told someone to fuck off, done something really ridiculous, in a\u00a0drunken state, and made the pressures worse, because then I had to answer for whatever thing I&apos;d said something out of turn to someone\u2026 and the vicious circle just started from there.&quot; The cycle was add-ressed when he went to jail, a\u00a0traumatic experience that he describes as &quot;the making of me&quot;, aided by spells on anger-management courses and in counselling and at AA meetings. A lot of what he says is clearly inflected with the language of personal development and redemption. He talks repeatedly about his addictive personality, about the importance of learning balance, about how &quot;the complete fuck-ups&quot; in his life have enabled him to become who he is now. What&apos;s important these days, he says, is being happy with himself and being a good father; his son, Cassius, was born in December last year and, he says, he&apos;d rather put his kids through school than buy a 50-grand watch. I suggest that he could probably do both. &quot;Yeah, but what&apos;s the point? It only tells the time. You only need one watch. You only need one car. When does that stop, once you get into that?&quot; He&apos;s never really been one of the bling footballers, has he? &quot;No. I&apos;m not a\u00a0twat. To put it bluntly.&quot; Barton&apos;s life off the pitch has been very much quieter over the past few years, but on the field of play and in the dressing-room, he still cuts a controversial figure. Before we meet, I have to have a stern talk with myself about not mentioning the game last August in which all Arsenal fans will contend that Barton got new signing Gervinho sent off on his debut; he&apos;s had similarly abrasive encounters since with fellow midfielders, Karl Henry from Wolves and Norwich&apos;s Bradley Johnson, the latter earning him a three-match ban. My questions about this kind of stuff are possibly the only time he tenses up: &quot;I&apos;m in a contact sport,&quot; he says tersely. It&apos;s a response that will chime with football fans who fear the game turning into an over-regulated series of exhibition matches \u2013 what more do you want from your midfielders, after all, than a bit of blood and guts? But in Barton&apos;s case, one wonders how much his intemperateness has been detrimental to his football and to his progression in the game. In 2007, he spent 12 minutes on the pitch as a substitute as England played Spain under Steve McClaren. Subsequently, Fabio Capello indicated that he felt Barton was a &quot;dangerous&quot; player who couldn&apos;t be relied on not to get sent off. The call-up never came. His clashes with those in authority show no sign of abating, although thus far he has been entirely circumspect about QPR&apos;s new manager Mark Hughes, a steely character who one imagines takes a dim view of players stepping out of line to air their opinions. Hughes&apos;s predecessor, Neil Warnock, wasn&apos;t so lucky: when he was sacked in January, Barton \u2013 his captain \u2013 at first appeared to offer his Twitter condolences (&quot;Gutted to hear about the manager losing his job&quot;) only to liken him, a couple of weeks later, to hapless fictional England manager Mike Bassett. His attitudes to his elders and betters (I can hear him snort at that &quot;betters&quot;) at times seems fuelled by crude bravado. And it sits oddly alongside the rather more thoughtful way that he approaches other aspects of his life. He&apos;s almost as likely to be tweeting about galleries he&apos;s visited (&quot;fell in love with John Singer Sargent&quot;), the joys of changing nappies and his latest viewing and reading material (recent hits: Chomsky and Naomi Wolf). He talks about how Twitter has &quot;really engaged my social conscience\u2026 no one&apos;s speaking about people, so I&apos;m going to have to do it. I&apos;m going to have to comment, because if I don&apos;t do it, no one else is going to do it.&quot; Not exactly true, but what I\u00a0think he means is that he&apos;s able to connect with a whole phalanx of people who mightn&apos;t otherwise be thinking about NHS reform or the economy or what&apos;s on Question Time. It would be easy to be cynical about his motives. Twitter, he tells me, made him look at himself from &quot;a sort of brand perspective&quot;, and many have jumped on his attempts to reinvent himself, 140 characters at a time (&quot;misguided arrogance,&quot; said the Daily Mail recently, &quot;often just Vinnie Jones with Wi-Fi&quot;). Even so, there&apos;s a subtext to much of the commentary that, if I\u00a0were him, might make me quite angry. Because essentially, when he&apos;s now referred to as art-lover Joey Barton, or Nietzsche-quoting Joey Barton, or social-media philosopher Joey Barton, there&apos;s a sense that he&apos;s a) putting it on, b) taking the piss or c) getting a bit above himself. Which is really just another way of saying the bourgeoisie isn&apos;t quite sure what to do if someone working class goes to an art gallery. And which is why, when he and I meet for a second time, we decide to go to the National Portrait Gallery and have a look at the Lucian Freud exhibition. &quot;Intriguing character this fellow,&quot; he tweets, ahead of our outing \u2013 which, incidentally, we get to on the tube and follow with lunch that costs a grand total of \u00a317.80. I\u00a0mention it because I imagine most journalists dispatched for a day out on the town with a\u00a0Premier League footballer would quake at the thought of their impending expenses claim. If he&apos;s putting on his enthusiasm for art, he&apos;s making a pretty good go of it. On the way in, he tells me quite a lot about Freud I didn&apos;t know (&quot;I&apos;d have thought you&apos;d have done your research, Alex&quot;) and once there, he&apos;s clearly immensely engaged, standing very close to pictures for a very long time. He&apos;s already told me that one of the things he thinks he can achieve on Twitter is to counteract the limitations placed on &quot;kids from working-class backgrounds who&apos;ve been told not to like art&quot;; walking around a gallery with him for hours, I think he&apos;s probably got a better chance of doing that than Sky Arts or BBC4. Mind you, you can never tell with Joey Barton. Shortly after our outing, I go abroad and have to do without internet access and Sky Sports News while I&apos;m travelling. When I come back, I check in on @Joey7Barton to see what he&apos;s been up to. I&apos;m vaguely aware that he&apos;s not been having the best time on the pitch; but then again, who does, when their team&apos;s hovering around the relegation zone as the season goes into its nervy run-in? But he&apos;s not there. On 24 March, a series of tweets voicing his feelings at being dropped from QPR&apos;s team \u2013 &quot;Very, very disappointed&quot;, &quot;Not selected&quot; \u2013 culminates in the announcement of &quot;a little Twitter sabbatical before I say something I&apos;ll end up regretting&quot;. The following week, when Barton is back captaining the team and QPR beat Arsenal at Loftus Road, I think he might re-emerge, but no dice. Strangely enough, I miss him. Shortly afterwards, we meet up for a final time and he tells me about his new internet project. Twitter, he confides, has had its positive and negative aspects, but what he wants now is a space that he controls, &quot;almost a self-publication&quot;. His plans sound ambitious \u2013 writing his own material, video content and, most importantly, the opportunity to bring people together: &quot;For me, it&apos;s about being a hub, or being involved in helping people to kickstart conversations that maybe will help make a change for the better&quot;. He&apos;ll be back on Twitter, but more, one suspects, to draw attention to the website. &quot;Sometimes,&quot; he reflects, &quot;you can stay in a space too long.&quot; In fact, Barton resists attempts to keep him in confined spaces \u2013 or boxes \u2013 for very long at all. So much about him \u2013 the repeated narrative of misdemeanour and rehabilitation, the outsider status he seems to crave and shun at the same time, the two-fingered salute to authority \u2013 makes you want to extrapolate, to reach some general conclusion about these multi-millionaire loose cannons that we&apos;ve created, with their brilliance and their rages and their vendettas and their persecution complexes. And about the love that we bestow on them when they do what we want and the furious revenge we want to exact when they disappoint us. But I\u00a0don&apos;t think you can. Barton is at once more intelligent and more unpredictable than many of his peers \u2013 and his demons have, over the years, pursued him more vigorously. And, the obvious: footballers are not as homogenous as we would like them to be. It comes down to this: Joey Barton is not Frank Lampard. Or Luis Suarez. Or Ryan Giggs. Or even Mario Balotelli. He&apos;s Joey Barton and, as he tells me with an earnestness that borders on the endearing, &quot;I&apos;m quite happy to say I&apos;m fucked up. I&apos;m peculiar and a weirdo. That&apos;s me.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-04-14T23:00:00Z", "tags": ["Joey Barton", "Football", "Twitter", "Media", "Internet", "Blogging", "Technology", "Premier League", "Newcastle United", "QPR", "Mike Ashley", "Mark Hughes", "Neil Warnock", "National Portrait Gallery", "Art and design", "Lucian Freud"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/apr/14/joey-barton-interview", "title": "Joey Barton: a man of two halves", "sentences": ["In 2004, he stubbed a cigar out in the eye of City colleague Jamie Tandy at the club&apos;s Christmas party; the following year, he was found guilty of gross misconduct after a disturbance in Bangkok with a\u00a0teenage Everton fan."]}, {"article": "For generations, only a few subjects were allowed to dominate conversation in those citadels frequented by Edinburgh&apos;s civil service mandarins: the state of the playing fields at Fettes; who&apos;s turn it is to get the next knighthood. No more. For another matter is currently exercising the minds of those gilded and shadowy few whose job it is to detach new governments from their manifesto commitments. Just who will be chosen to form the front rank of new Scottish ambassadors in the world&apos;s juiciest capital cities? &quot;Frankly, Farquhar, if it&apos;s not London, Paris, New York, Bonn or Beijing, then I&apos;ll be most put out. But Athens, Bangkok or Rio wouldn&apos;t be too shabby either, if you catch my drift, old boy.&quot; Nor can you blame them. The last place they want to be if the balloon goes up and Scotland becomes officially independent is in Edinburgh telling those dreadful little SNP oiks that no, they can&apos;t just scuttle the Faslane submarine fleet and bury the warheads in carbon-friendly landfill sites. Yet who will foot the bill for all those townhouses in smart boulevards and the limousines with the fluttering Saltires on them? Does the home team pay the fees or do they split it 50-50 like a Scottish cup tie? Surely the host nation won&apos;t be expected to pay the salaries of the flotilla of support staff in all of the new overseas Scottish embassies. And don&apos;t believe for one minute any SNP sophistry about Scottish embassies not being a priority in the new free Scotland. Even as they make these denials, the chaps at procurement are being told to secure some cheeky wee three-for-two bulk deals for the Ferrero Rochers. To the ordinary taxpayer, our new devolved Scotia doesn&apos;t look or feel much different from old, pre-devolved Scotia, give or take a few free anti-convulsants for Aunt Flora. Indeed, those to whom most benefits accrued were the Edinburgh civil service and the assorted political fluffers and panderers who gather daily round Holyrood. For them, devolution has been one giant job-creation exercise. In an independent Scotland, the Royal Mile will be absolutely hoaching with the couscous and goat&apos;s cheese brigade. Add to that the costs of staffing our embassies abroad and that&apos;s the first 10 years of North Sea oil revenues taken care of. Of course, when we are hosting meetings of Opec ministers at Gleneagles in our new oil-rich Xanadu, we are assured that we will be able to afford anything. Even so, it&apos;s best to be cautious. Thus, in the spirit of fiscal responsibility, probity and rectitude \u2013 so important in those first few years of Free Scotia \u2013 I propose an alternative strategy in ensuring our interests are represented abroad: People&apos;s Embassies. We would establish these in parts of the world that are of special interest to the Scottish people. They will not necessarily be located in the administrative centres or capital cities of the host country. And they would be staffed by an army of volunteers chosen for their aptitude in those disciplines deemed most appropriate for the location. It would work on the guiding principles of the Voluntary Service Overseas. Here are a few at the top of my list. Buckfastleigh, Devon This part of England is home to the wonderful monks of Buckfast Abbey who brew the tonic wine that bears their name. This elixir has also become known as the Coatbridge Commotion Lotion after locals in this Lanarkshire township adopted it as their drink of choice. As the sobriquet suggests, it also has robust revivifying properties. Happily, on account of the monks&apos; sensible and proportionate pricing policies, it has escaped the SNP&apos;s worthless tax on cheap bevvy. It is to be hoped that, for many years to come, Buckfast Abbey&apos;s excellent beverage continues to provide a warm glow to the Scots who have elected it their drink of choice and who have had to endure the vile imprecations of the political classes for having done so. Pyongyang  North Korea is the country that makes all other police states look like Camberwick Green. And so it makes sense that the new Scotland should have a People&apos;s Embassy situated in its capital city. When a new single national police force comes into being next year, Scotland will have created an all-powerful entity presided over by an unelected chief answering to no one but the justice minister and an as yet undecided board possessing as much power as a Rotary Club committee. In the last few weeks, we have observed the four police horses of the apocalypse in our midst: corruption, racism, violence and profligacy. The North Koreans will welcome us with open arms. Panama In this fabled isthmus, Scotland&apos;s only previous attempt at becoming a trading giant ended in ignominy at Darien in the late 17th century. But it wasn&apos;t all doom and gloom. Far from it. The failure of the scheme led to most of Scotland&apos;s nobles becoming impoverished, which in turn made them more susceptible to the blandishments of the English and the Treaty of Union in 1707. Scotland has never since looked back. The joyous episode was celebrated by the splendid heavy rock outfit, Van Halen, in 1984 with their hit single Panama. Wouldn&apos;t it be wonderful to mark this great event in Scotland&apos;s history by attempting to re-establish a trading colony there after independence? The nasty Spaniards have long gone and, as there are loads of big trees and exotic animals, we could make it a national park and thus underpin our reputation as a new environmental superpower. Benidorm  This jewel on Spain&apos;s gorgeous Costa Blanca has long been the holiday destination de choix for generations of discerning Scots working-class people. At a time when foreign travel was exclusively the preserve of the affluent, Benidorm provided an affordable alternative. At the same time, it broadened the outlook of many Scots and led to healthy changes in the eating and drinking patterns of Scots. There is also some evidence that holidays in Benidorm led to Scotland being recognised as one of the world leaders in the treatment of venereal diseases.", "publicationDate": "2012-04-14T23:03:03Z", "tags": ["Scottish independence", "Scotland"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/15/kevin-mckenna-scotland-peoples-embassies", "title": "Do you want to be our man in Pyongyang? | Kevin McKenna", "sentences": ["But Athens, Bangkok or Rio wouldn&apos;t be too shabby either, if you catch my drift, old boy.&quot; Nor can you blame them."]}, {"article": "A former Libyan dissident who was abducted and flown to one of Muammar Gaddafi&apos;s prisons in a so-called rendition operation mounted with the help of MI6 has started legal proceedings against Jack Straw, who was British foreign secretary at the time. Lawyers representing Abdel Hakim Belhaj confirmed on Wednesday they had served papers on Straw alleging his complicity in the torture that Belhaj subsequently suffered, as well as misfeasance in public office. Straw is already facing the prospect of being questioned by Scotland Yard detectives after an announcement by the Crown Prosecution Service earlier this year that a criminal investigation was being launched into the rendition operation. Belhaj and his wife are alleging that Straw was complicit in the &quot;torture, inhuman and degrading treatment, batteries and assaults&quot; that they say were perpetrated on them by Thai and US agents, as well as Libyan authorities. They are seeking damages from Straw for the trauma they suffered. Documents discovered in an abandoned Libyan government office last September outlined the role that MI6 \u2013 and in particular its head of counterterrorism, Mark Allen \u2013 played in providing the intelligence that allowed the CIA to detain Belhaj and his pregnant wife, Fatima Bouchar, in Bangkok in March 2004. Last week, Bouchar told the Guardian how she was chained to a wall for five days in a secret prison in Bangkok before being taped from head to foot and secured to a stretcher for the 17-hour flight to Tripoli. Significantly, MI6 did not deny involvement when the documents were discovered: instead, well-placed Whitehall sources insisted the agency&apos;s actions were part of &quot;ministerially authorised government policy&quot;. There were reports at the weekend that MI6 confronted Straw with evidence that he was the minister who personally authorised the operation. This is said to have happened after Straw gave a radio interview last year in which he sought to distance himself from the affair, telling listeners that &quot;no foreign secretary can know all the details of what its intelligence agencies are doing at any one time&quot;. Those reports triggered the decision by Belhaj&apos;s lawyers to serve legal papers on the former foreign secretary. Those papers also demand that Straw disclose documents relating to the rendition of a second Libyan dissident, Sami al-Saadi, who was abducted and flown to Libya a few days after Belhaj, along with his wife and four children. Although Belhaj&apos;s lawyers have already launched proceedings against the British government, the latest action is against Straw personally, and is thought to be the first time proceedings of this kind have been taken against a former foreign secretary. If the case reaches court, it would be exactly the sort of proceedings that would be heard behind closed doors, under the justice ministry&apos;s much-criticised secret justice proposals, which some ministers say are needed to protect national security, but which critics suspect are intended to protect the government and intelligence agencies from embarrassment. Sapna Malik, of the London law firm Leigh Day, said: &quot;We have said all along that liability must follow the chain of command. These latest revelations bring us closer to that goal. If the former foreign secretary does not now own up to his role in this extraordinary affair, he will need to face the prospect of trying to defend his position in court.&quot; Cori Crider, of the legal charity Reprieve, which is also representing the two men, said: &quot;When scandals like this break, the political paymasters almost never face the music. For once, there&apos;s a chance things might be different. &quot;We&apos;ve said from the start that the minister responsible for this mess needed to admit their role. Now that we seem to know who it was, it&apos;s time for Jack Straw to account \u2013 and atone \u2013 for what he did.&quot; As the scale of UK support for the CIA&apos;s rendition programme began to become clear in 2005, Straw dismissed media reports as little more than conspiracy theories. In December 2005 he told MPs on the Commons foreign affairs committee that &quot;unless we all start to believe in conspiracy theories and that the officials are lying, that I am lying, that behind this there is some kind of secret state which is in league with some dark forces in the United States\u00a0\u2026 there simply is no truth in the claims that the United Kingdom has been involved in rendition.&quot; Contacted on Wednesday, Straw said he had nothing to add to comments he made during the radio interview. MI6 regularly requests foreign secretaries to &quot;disapply&quot; UK law in order to protect its officers from being prosecuted or sued in the UK as a result of their operations overseas. The authorisations can be signed only by secretaries of state, and do not offer any protection for those politicians. Last week, Tony Blair also faced renewed questions about the abduction of Belhaj and his wife.

The group is called Junior Kilat and it&apos;s fair to say they aren&apos;t responding effusively to my direction. Indeed it could be suggested that they aren&apos;t paying any attention to me at all. When I try to catch the eye of singer Errol &quot;Budoy&quot; Marabiles, he pretends there&apos;s something very interesting happening in the middle distance. But never mind \u2013 I persevere. Before heading to the Philippines, I had never imagined I would take to live dub with such enthusiasm. Perhaps it had something to do with the local brew, the cheap-as-chips \u2013 but far more potent \u2013 Tanduay Rhum. Or maybe it was the surroundings, the palm-filled hills of Puerto Galera. By a tranquil, azure bay on the north side of Mindoro island, 120km south of Manila, it earned its name in the 16th century as a port in a storm for Spanish galleons. Today it&apos;s a Unesco-designated reserve, and instead of colonial merchants, young travellers from around Asia, and further afield, are washing up on its shores.     Bay at Puerto Galera, Philippines Photograph: Paul MacInnes    A motley crew of British hacks and DJs, we&apos;re on the island for the Malasimbo Festival, and none of us is quite sure what to expect. We arrive on a Friday afternoon after a dusty drive from Manila and a crowded catamaran crossing to Mindoro. After a few restorative San Miguels, we&apos;re whisked into the hills towards Mount Malasimbo. It&apos;s a steep climb and a rocky road, not the ideal terrain for a jeepney (the local transport, an unfortunate combination of retired military vehicle and cattle truck). But after a few stalls and a couple of worrying moments of slippage we arrive at the entrance to the festival site, 250m above sea level. Complimentary Tanduays in hand, we head down a fairy light-lined path. Turning the corner into the festival, my mouth forms an involuntary &quot;wow&quot;. To the left of us an emerald slope rolls down into a broad clearing lined with palm trees. Lights installed among the fronds cast kaleidoscopic rays across the tree line and pieces of sculpture scattered beneath. The festival&apos;s single stage stands in the middle of the clearing where a band of percussionists are hammering out a series of complex, syncopated rhythms. We charge down the hill. It&apos;s only the second year of the Malasimbo Festival but in 12 months, attendance has more than doubled, to 5,000 people. Its aim is simple: rather than flying in acts from around the globe, Malasimbo concentrates on showcasing Filipino music (headliner Joe Bataan is a US citizen but of Filipino extraction, so he kind of counts). That means all strands of Filipino music, from soul to jazz, hip-hop to beat music, psych rock and as many permutations of dub reggae as you can imagine. Not everything is of the highest quality but there is a real sense of celebration to every performance and to be exposed to such a range of new music in one place is a rare occurrence \u2013 it feels a privilege to be there. That Friday night we stay on until the DJs among us, Dave Harvey and Steve Nickolls of Bristol-based Futureboogie, have played their mix of cutting-edge house and electro to a crowd which, by this hour, is anything but cutting-edge. We scramble for the last jeepney home and by the time the sun has come up we have descended the hill and are dozing by the pool of our hotel (there&apos;s no camping at Malasimbo, which might detract from the authentic festival experience, but does have its consolations).     Malasimbo Festival dancers Photograph: Paul Macinnes    A few hours later we&apos;re up again for day two, helped by a tosilog, the Filipino fry-up. Garlicky rice and fried eggs are served with tocino, thick slices of bacon marinated in anise wine and sugar. It&apos;s sweet, it&apos;s sour, it&apos;s full of fat and, with a side order of Jazz Chutney, it&apos;s the perfect way to start this particular day. From the hotel we head to the boat. Boat parties are what the Brits have brought to Malasimbo. The idea is that dancing all night on land is not enough; you need to dance all afternoon and throw yourself in the sea, too. So, anchored out in the bay, looking a bit like a floating climbing frame, is our venue, the Liki Tiki. Futureboogie, as fresh as the morning dew, are on the decks again and I offer moral support by imbibing more rum and hurling myself off the top deck. Nick Colgan, our host for the trip, is watching the crowd. A broad, bald Brummie who spent 25 years as tour manager for UB40, he now presides over a series of festivals that have helped make Croatia a clubbing destination. For his Garden Festival he took a scenic stretch of coast with friendly weather and created a different kind of festival, built around daytime boat parties. He&apos;s hoping to do the same in the Philippines, launching the Tropical Garden festival in spring 2012 on the same site. On this trip he veers between avuncular and hard-nosed, keeping an eye on everything from our wellbeing to the sound systems to the state of the jeepneys&apos; suspension. But while on the Liki Tiki, however, he could be forgiven for checking out the clientele and allowing a few bells to ring in his head. For on the boat are not just trendy young Filipinos but kids from all over east Asia \u2013 from Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore. These are kids who are used to clubbing but less familiar with being able to do it in wide-open spaces. They are well aware of the European festival habit and are keen to have one of their own \u2013 perhaps without the muddy fields, but that&apos;s not too difficult to achieve in this part of the world.     Percussionists, Malasimbo Festival    That said, when we head back up the hill that Saturday night a tropical shower becomes a persistent downpour \u2013 not that it stops the crowd, or the increasingly redoubtable Futureboogie boys. The next morning, the skies are blue once more and I&apos;m standing at the prow of a catamaran heading away from Mindoro. I&apos;ve got muddy shoes, a mangled wristband and a mysterious bruise on my buttock. And I&apos;m happy. \u2022 The trip was provided by The Garden Festival (thegardenfestival.eu) which will host The Tropical Garden Festival next spring and the Malasimbo Festival (malasimbofestival.com, dates for 2013&apos;s festival tbc).

Omitted from the 1983 Granta Best Young Writers list that included near-contemporaries Amis, Barnes, Rushdie and McEwan, he rapidly out-performed most rivals with a 75% Booker prize short-list hit-rate from his first four novels but failed to take the final prize with either Sour Sweet, An Insular Possession or The Redundancy of Courage. Then, after a financial row with traditional UK publishers, Mo left for the Far East, from where self-published novels have arrived at ever longer intervals. A decade has passed between Renegade and Mo&apos;s sixth novel Pure, which perhaps reveals the author&apos;s ignorance of \u2013 or indifference to \u2013 the Brit Lit scene by re-using the title of a novel that won Andrew Miller last year&apos;s Costa prize. It would be a thrilling moment for cultural statisticians if one of the leading British book prizes were to be won in consecutive years by different novels with the same title, and the possibility cannot be discounted because Mo&apos;s book is a thrilling reminder of what we have been missing during his exile. For the last two decades, novelists in the west have suspected that the &quot;necessary subject&quot; (as Nadine Gordimer once described apartheid) is the rise of Islamist terrorism and the spread of Arab nationalism. Most English-writing authors, though, have concluded that they lacked either the background, languages or \u2013 after what happened to Salman Rushdie for The Satanic Verses, a novel that seems increasingly prophetic \u2013 guts to tackle the topic. One exception is John le Carr\u00e9, whose example Mo is possibly acknowledging by casting Pure in the form of a spy story. There are certainly echoes of Le Carr\u00e9 characters in Victor, an elderly Oxbridge don whose fictional Brecon College has numbered among its students many future Arab potentates and several spooks, including Victor himself. Surely, though, only Mo could have imagined the figure who alternates most of the novel&apos;s narration with Victor: Snooky, a 6ft-tall Thai lady boy and movie critic. A consistent joy of the book is Mo&apos;s voice \u2013 or rather, voices. The cascade of multilingual puns and pan-global cultural references nods to the work of Anthony Burgess, although that writer came to the far east as more of an outsider, and there is a frequent sense in Pure that Mo is setting down sentences that only he has the linguistic and cultural knowledge to write. For example, although Snooky&apos;s sections of the text are technically first-person, they are usually recited in the third because the Siamese habit is apparently to substitute your own first name for &quot;I&quot;, in a manner restricted in the west to professional sportsmen. We also learn that the words for &quot;far&quot; and &quot;near&quot; in Thai are identical, differentiated by one being spoken &quot;lower and more emphatic&quot;, and that the Siamese word for vagina is &quot;he&quot;. Snooky, though, is confused when someone speaks &quot;in the Southern language, quite incomprehensible if you were a speaker of standard Bangkok Siamese&quot;. In the cheeky keenness of its ear, Pure often resembles being a student on a Berlitz course taught by James Joyce. A novel built on verbal riffs can risk becoming an exercise in virtuostic surfaces, but there is depth here as well; in both the learned references to a century of eastern history and the thoughtful interplay between the religious beliefs of Islamic characters and the Anglo-Catholic faith of Victor. Traditional publishing houses will argue that Mo has put himself at a disadvantage by rejecting conventional editing and marketing. And, while even editions from some of the classiest houses these days sometimes seem to have gone direct from writer&apos;s desk to book-shelf, there are moments when you wonder if Pure could have benefitted from tougher editing, both in its periodic rambles and a distracting attitude to fact. When Victor misquotes a line by Yeats or appears to get wrong the chronology of the second world war, it&apos;s impossible to be sure if Mo is dramatising sloppiness or enacting it. These, though, are small concerns about a return that, for most of its duration, should have serious readers on their feet cheering. Separated from other British writers first by background and then geography, Mo has also become increasingly isolated in his willingness to take risks. He shows a daring with structure, language and subject matter that is matched in recent fiction only by Philip Hensher, whose Scenes From Early Life: A Novel should be one of Mo&apos;s rivals on this year&apos;s literary prize lists. It would be a great shame if Mo&apos;s deliberate distance from this country and its publishing structures mean that Pure will come to be seen as one that got away.", "publicationDate": "2012-04-20T21:55:01Z", "tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "Culture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/20/pure-timothy-mo-review", "title": "Pure  by Timothy Mo \u2013 review", "sentences": ["Snooky, though, is confused when someone speaks &quot;in the Southern language, quite incomprehensible if you were a speaker of standard Bangkok Siamese&quot;."]}, {"article": "Standing at the entrance to Lang Co town hall, 69-year-old Mai Truc Lam gestured to the two-story building, the sun-drenched parking lot and two-lane road in front, and described the small coastal community as it once was. &quot;We are standing in an area that used to be mangroves,&quot; the weathered fisherman said, and then described the negative impact deforestation has wrought on the area&apos;s sea life. &quot;Now, we do not see some species of fish here anymore.&quot; A few minutes&apos; drive away, on a sliver of sand that forms the Lap An Lagoon on the central coast of Vietnam, lies a modest grove of trees \u2013 some evergreens that shed a path of soft needles, and where the land meets the sea, Lang Co&apos;s few remaining hectares of mangroves, perched above the water upon their stilted, flying buttress-like roots. Some of the mangrove trees have torpedo-shaped seeds, which have poked into the ground and given birth to a new generation of delicate seedlings, all too easily trampled upon by oblivious passersby. Yet these remaining mangroves face the threat of being razed entirely to make way for a golf course as part of local economic development plans \u2013 part of a global development trend that has seen the clearance of as much as 50% of the world&apos;s mangroves over the past half a century. Mangroves grow along the ocean coasts of 118 countries \u2013 with a quarter of the world&apos;s 40m hectares being in south-east Asia \u2013 but with widespread deforestation due to population pressure, expansion of shrimp farms and development, scientists fear mangroves may disappear altogether in as little as 100 years. At their best, mangroves form a vast coastal barrier of trunks and roots against the sea, controlling erosion, protecting communities from storms, and providing an environment for greater fish diversity. Furthermore, scientists last year unveiled research pointing to mangrove forests as ideal repositories for carbon storage \u2013 containing an average of 1,000 tonnes of carbon per hectare, compared with 300 tonnes per hectare of tropical forest \u2013 which could help to fight climate change by keeping carbon locked away on land and out of the atmosphere. The scientists found that most of the carbon in mangrove forests \u2013 49% to 98% \u2013 is stored below ground in thick, tidally submerged soil in which decomposition is anaerobic in the absence of oxygen. Yet with mangrove conservation up against economic development, the more obvious path to money wins. &quot;My sense in Lang Co, and in provinces across Vietnam, is that economic development has become a driving force so dominant that environmental precautions have fallen by the wayside,&quot; said Evan Fox, a coastal planning consultant. &quot;In villages where local governments are searching for ways to bolster their economic output, it is difficult to justify preservation of an area if managers and local people cannot discern its tangible benefit.&quot; There are laws that protect the forests and mangroves in Vietnam, but enforcement can be lax, rendering such regulations impotent. &quot;My interpretation is that it&apos;s illegal but everything is negotiable in Vietnam and since there is no consequence for breaking the law (at least in the environmental domain), mangroves get cut. Anyway, since there are so many conflicting laws, you can probably legalise what you&apos;ve done by reference to a previous law,&quot; said Jake Brunner, programme co-ordinator for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in Vietnam. Shrimp farms have been one of the big drivers behind mangrove loss. A 2011 analysis of images of Vietnam&apos;s southern Mekong delta \u2013 an area that is typically mangroves \u2013 found that from 1973 to 2008, more than half of the mangroves were converted into shrimp farms, causing serious erosion. Nonetheless, communities and governments have taken little notice of the protective services that mangroves provide until a disaster of epic proportions strikes \u2013 such as the Indian Ocean tsunami that killed some 180,000 people in western Indonesia&apos;s Aceh province. &quot;In Aceh, after the tsunami, the result wouldn&apos;t have been like this, if we still had mangroves,&quot; said Daniel Murdiyarso, a scientist with the Indonesia-based Centre for International Forestry Research and one of the researchers behind the mangrove carbon-storage findings. Disaster management and risk reduction are now squarely on the Indonesian government&apos;s radar, but in most countries \u2013 and most of the time \u2013 the impact of climate change is incremental and therefore unlikely to spur governments and communities to action. When typhoons have hit Vietnam, mangroves have helped to save lives. &quot;That&apos;s when people noticed that where there were mangroves, people survived,&quot; Brunner said. &quot;Thailand and Indonesia suffered a very high magnitude event, the tsunami, and that sent a very clear message. In Vietnam, there have been higher frequency, but lower magnitude events, so it hasn&apos;t quite had the same impact, and you still see mangroves being lost.&quot; Initiatives like the Mangroves for the Future (MFF), established after the 2004 tsunami and co-chaired by IUCN and the UN Development Programme, offer grants to communities like Lang Co to protect their mangroves. Since 2008, MFF has implemented about 90 projects in its eight member countries across south and south-east Asia. The $29,000 project in Lang Co \u2013 $23,000 from MFF and $6,000 from the grantee organisation, the Centre for Community Research and Development (CCRD), and the local community \u2013 is to focus on supporting natural regeneration of existing mangroves, which is less expensive and more effective than planting. According to CCRD, Lang Co had about 100 hectares of mangroves two decades ago, but today only five hectares of poor-quality mangroves remain. Under the MFF grant, the Lang Co fishing association has been tasked with looking after these mangroves. Local fishermen will be trained in mangrove and aquatic resource management and protection.

A young, beautiful girl from an up-country town arrives in the big city, gets lucky with a role in a B-movie and brags about her wealthy family. Overheard on the set by two fellow actors, she is allegedly kidnapped and held for ransom. When her boasts of wealth turn out to be unfounded, she is killed and parts of her body hurled from a moving train. However, the fate of 26-year-old Meenakshi Thapar is no Bollywood horror flick but a true crime, the details of which have been revealed in successive front-page stories by India&apos;s press over recent days. Amit Jaiswal, 36, and his lover, Preeti Surin, were arrested after police found them in possession of Thapar&apos;s mobile phone sim card. Police said they later confessed to strangling her. Along with a spate of similar cases, the murder has provoked deep concern in Mumbai, India&apos;s sprawling commercial and creative powerhouse where Thapar allegedly met her killers, as well as morbid fascination across India. Shobhaa D\u00e9, a socialite and writer based in Mumbai, said inhabitants of the city could no longer smugly contrast themselves with Delhi, which has long had a reputation for brutal sexual violence. &quot;There was a time when Mumbaikars would express shock and awe at the violent goings-on in the national capital \u2026 We would say a trifle smugly, &apos;Thank God we live in a civilised city&apos; \u2026 Till a recent spate of grisly, cold-blooded killings woke us up to a harsh new reality,&quot; D\u00e9 wrote in her column for the Asian Age newspaper at the weekend. The other recent murder mystery in Mumbai involved an aspiring producer, another actor/model and her partner. In that case it was the producer, 28-year-old Karan Kakkad, who ended up dead. The actor-model, a socialite called Simran Sood who has been pictured in local media with a variety of cricketers, top businessmen and A-list Bollywood stars, has since been arrested along with her partner, an alleged gangster. Sood&apos;s story also reads like a movie script. Like Thapar, she had gone to Mumbai with dreams of becoming a Bollywood star but had not managed to break into films. She met her partner while he was working in a restaurant near her gym, and police say the pair killed Kakkad, allegedly out of greed, because of the BMW he drove. Sood, who is alleged to have acted as a honey trap, flew to Bangkok. Her partner is said to have been found using Kakkad&apos;s credit cards. Veteran police officers say that the number of such incidents is unprecedented. &quot;We used to get the odd case like this but never so many. We never saw things so well organised before either,&quot; said Sachin Vaze, a security consultant who retired from Mumbai police after 20 years when elite anti-gangster units were disbanded five years ago. The murders of Kakkad and Thapar played out against the backdrop of Mumbai&apos;s western suburbs of Juhu and Andheri, where many of the stars live in high-rise apartment blocks set back from the Indian Ocean.

Very few succeed and many sink into a netherworld of vice and drug abuse.

In another incident that has shocked local people, a gang in Mumbai beat a 17-year-old student to death last week.

If Britain has struggled to sell the idea of high-speed rail to a sceptical public, the government might like to turn to Italy for inspiration. From Saturday, the traveller from Rome to Naples can cover the 225km (140 miles) in little over an hour, paying as little as \u20ac20 (\u00a316.33) for the pleasure. The new Italo \u2013 the first privately operated high-speed train in Europe \u2013 is a train like no other, claims Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, chairman of Ferrari and boss of NTV, the firm challenging the state service. He has a point. Sleeker, faster, quieter, lighter, the AGV \u2013 automotrice \u00e0 grande vitesse \u2013 brings into passenger service the technology behind the train world speed record of 574.8kmph in April 2007. British campaigners for high speed rail rolled out music veteran and train enthusiast Pete Waterman in January, but only the Italians could attempt to make a train launch sexy. Mobbed by press at the inaugural journey from Rome Tiburtina, the flamboyant Montezemolo purred: &quot;I&apos;m addicted to speed. Speed and risk. Economic risk.&quot; There are no travel &quot;classes&quot;, NTV insists, only different &quot;ambiences&quot; \u2013 albeit differentiated by bigger seats, at-seat dining and pricier tickets. &quot;Remember, you&apos;re in the cheap seats!&quot; cried Montezemolo, to the press in carriage seven (ambience: &quot;Smart&quot;). He stressed that &quot;our prices are super-competitive despite the services we offer&quot;, which include free Wi-Fi, live TV, films in a cinema carriage and comfortable leather seating. Should his Nuovo Trasporto Viaggiatori (NTV) successfully grab a projected 20% share of the market from state-owned Trenitalia and start making money, Montezemolo told the Guardian he might indeed seek to export his brand of superfast travel to the UK. &quot;If it&apos;s possible to compete in other countries, yes we would.&quot; Other markets will be in play long before the UK gets its act together. The transport department says no decisions have been taken about either the parameters for procurement of trains or how operators will be sought. The hybrid bill that will give the parliamentary muscle to make HS2, the proposed high-speed railway from London to Birmingham, a reality is still a potential pitfall, for all the assent that the transport secretary can give. The manufacturing and engineering group Alstom, which provided Virgin&apos;s Pendolinos for the west coast mainline as well as France&apos;s TGVs and now the state of the art Italo AGV, will doubtless be one of the prime contenders to build the trains that should ply the tracks from London to Birmingham after 2026. Not only does the AGV hit the top speeds that the tracks allow effortlessly, it does not display anything so vulgar as a locomotive doing the pushing or pulling. Distributed traction means that where you might expect to find a locomotive is, on the Italo, the cinema car; at the other end, the Prima carriage. This, according to Pierre-Louis Bertina, boss of Alstom&apos;s Italian train operations, is the most visible difference. The bigger technological advances, Bertina said, are hidden from the layman. The train&apos;s speed is capped on these tracks at 300kph, well within its capabilities. In true Ferrari and Formula One style, Alstom promises rapid &quot;pit stop&quot; maintenance as well as tracking technology to identify problems remotely, fix them quickly and keep the service running \u2013 an operation similar to the one it provides in the UK for Virgin. While the original high speed route in Italy connecting Rome and Florence dates back to 1978, most of the shoots of the wider network have grown over the last seven years, now running from Turin to Venice, crossing the Milan to Salerno line (still under construction in parts). Asked how high-speed rail changes a country, Montezemolo talked of how he had once spent an hour crossing Rome in the metro. Today, he was doing half the ancient Appian Way down to Naples in the same time. Andrew Adonis, the transport minister who put HS2 in motion, thought that the economic benefits would be clear: Birmingham could in effect be part of the London economy. Montezemolo concurs: &quot;It&apos;s like a super-metropolitan system for the while country,&quot; he said. In fact, it makes the journey between Italy&apos;s great classical cities virtually identical timewise to traversing London&apos;s Northern Line. That, Montezemolo might hasten to add, is where the comparison ends. Gwyn Topham was on a trip paid for by Alstom Fast tracks United Kingdom The High Speed Two route from London to Birmingham is to open in 2026, despite opposition from some people along the home counties stretch of the line. The second phase, from Birmingham to Leeds and Manchester, is expected to open in 2033, with the whole project costing \u00a333bn. The taxpayer will fund the construction of the tracks and basic infrastructure but the government is keen to get private sector involvement in the stations. United States  Spurred by Barack Obama&apos;s support for high speed rail early in his presidency, the California High-Speed Authority has backed a $68.4bn business plan to build a line between San Francisco and Los Angeles. However, the proposal must now get through state legislators. That will be difficult after a state-funded report criticised the proposals and recommended that the state should not provide the $2.6bn in seed funding needed to launch the project. Turkey Turkey could be a beneficiary of China&apos;s search for lucrative infrastructure investments.

Brazil Brazil hopes that a high-speed link between S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro will open in 2022, despite three failed attempts to find a private sector backer.

I got it at Stanfords, the map shop in Covent Garden. I probably would have bought it even before I saw who had taken the photo. The mountain is haughty and proud, an enormous glacier fills the valley in front and in the foreground \u2013 giving scale to the scene and a sense of infeasibility to the task facing the men inside them \u2013 is a little collection of tents. &quot;Camp at 20,000 feet with Everest in the distance. Photograph: AFR Wollaston, 1921&quot; reads the caption. The picture was taken by my grandfather. Grandfather? 1921? Yes, I know, we procreate late in my family. He was born in 1875, I know people whose granddads were born in 1975. I never knew him of course \u2013 he died 31 years before I was born. Actually he was murdered, but that&apos;s another story. The point is, he was the doctor and the naturalist on the first Everest expedition, in 1921. They weren&apos;t seriously expecting to climb it; it was merely reconnaissance. Things were different back then. The chaps who came to this part of the world all knew each other from Winchester or Cambridge or wherever, they could afford to take several months off from their jobs if they had them, and they came inappropriately dressed in wool and tweed and most probably had some inappropriate attitudes towards the locals who carried their stuff for them. They wandered around the Himalayas, smoking their pipes, collecting specimens, naming things after themselves.     The 1921 expedition, with AFR Wollaston far left, standing, with George Mallory in front of him     Nowadays it&apos;s different. Any old riff-raff can come. Including me. I&apos;m not climbing, just walking. And I&apos;m coming in from the south, from Nepal, which was closed to my grandad. He approached from Tibet. But we&apos;re in the same kind of area, and the big mountain named after the big double glazing company in the middle is the same. So there is a connection, OK? It&apos;s not just anyone who can come, but everyone too \u2013 and they do. In the previous month, 10,000 tourists had entered Sagarmatha national park. The trail north from the scary little airstrip at Lukla is chocker with trekkers \u2013 at times it&apos;s more like a queue than a walk. Antipodeans trade matey banter; purposeful Germans with trekking poles overtake on the straights; the French, beautifully turned out, shrug indifferently; fat tattooed Brits huff and puff on the inclines. Above us, the air is alive with helicopters ferrying Japanese tourists who have neither the time nor the inclination to walk up the valley. They will spend a night in the Hotel Everest View, gasping into oxygen cylinders. In the morning they will take photos on the terrace, then fly away. Tomorrow they&apos;ll probably be in Bangkok, or the Philippines. It&apos;s a place of national stereotypes and resentment, as well as brightly coloured hi-tech clothing. It&apos;s a Lonely Planet nightmare. Well it would be a nightmare, if it wasn&apos;t also so bloody lovely. The valley is everything you&apos;d want and more. An icy milky river thunders over rocks and below steep wooded slopes are lush fields where people are working the land, oblivious to the Gore-Tex procession. Oblivious but not unaffected: the houses are smart, the prayer wheels freshly painted, just about everyone has a mobile phone, it seems, and is on it, and there are very few places you can&apos;t get a signal around here. This is not really the place to come if you&apos;re looking for peace and quiet. One thing hasn&apos;t changed since the days of my grandfather. Sherpa people will carry your stuff for you. Obviously you can do it yourself, but then you&apos;re not contributing to the local economy, plus you&apos;ve got an enormous pack on your back. It&apos;s a modern dilemma for today&apos;s trekker, who must choose between the weight of weight and the weight of guilt.     One of the permanent campsites below Everest    Some porters are paid according to what they carry, so carry more in order to make more. There are men on the trails carrying terrifying loads, human yaks basically. I&apos;m on an organised trek, with a company called World Expeditions, which has a 30kg limit for its porters. Better, but I&apos;ve only got about 3kg \u2013 a water bottle, an extra layer, my camera. It&apos;s embarrassing. We&apos;re staying in a few lodges but most nights will be spent at World Expeditions&apos; new permanent campsites. This means that we can avoid lodges that burn wood and so trek with an easier conscience. Plus we can avoid some of the busier places \u2013 these campsites are mostly in secluded spots away from the trail. And they have lovely big tents, with campbeds in them, even mattresses. Oh and composting loos too (really not bad at all). Yeah it&apos;s glamping basically \u2013 I&apos;m being led, fed, and put to bed. There are eight of us in the group, and we have 23 people looking after us. Twenty-three! Our cook, whose name is Tika but who calls himself Mr Yum Yum, produces extraordinary meals \u2013 curries, but also pizza, chicken, elaborate puddings, even a chocolate cake, all cooked on a kerosene stove. Yak dung is used for heating. After supper we play cards \u2013 Shithead, Goo Kha Tauko in Nepali \u2013 with the Sherpas until it&apos;s too cold not to be zipped up in a down sleeping bag. Then, in the morning, BB and Mantre come round with hot tea and warm washing water, before we convene for Mr Yum Yum&apos;s porridge. Mmmm, OK, I think I&apos;m getting over my post-colonial angst; that&apos;s my bag, the big one over there; lead on, Ang. Ang, a thoughtful man though prone to the occasional attack of the giggles, usually brought on by Goo Kha Tauko is our guide. We cross the river on hairy high bridges bedecked with streaming prayer scarves, then up through steep woods to a clearing for a first view of 8,848m Everest. That&apos;s it, that distant wedge? To be honest it&apos;s a bit disappointing from here, but there&apos;ll be chances to see it better \u2013 and closer \u2013 later on. We&apos;re not actually going to Everest base camp, which is what most people do \u2013 so many people, it&apos;s pretty much Glastonbury up there by all accounts. Glaciertonbury, they call it \u2013 well, if they don&apos;t they should do. Anyway we&apos;re going to branch off that trail and head to a place called Gokyo, which has some nice lakes and hills to climb for a fine view over to Everest. Twelve days there and back.     An evening card game with the Sherpas    First, though, we need to acclimatise for a couple of nights in the village \u2013 practically a town actually \u2013 of Namche Bazar. The altitude, even here at Namche (3,440m) is beginning to have an effect. My heart rate and breathing are actually fine, and I&apos;m not getting headaches (come on, I&apos;ve got Himalayan adventurer in my genes). But my dreams have become extraordinarily vivid and intense. 3D \u2013 4D even \u2013 I wake up exhausted. It&apos;s similar, though more spectacular, for another member of the group. For Dave, a man in his mid-30s, the altitude turns back the clock at night, all the way to adolescence. Yes, Dave is having those kind of dreams. Twice in one night! I&apos;m not sharing with Dave, thank heaven. Still, it gives us something to talk about at breakfast \u2013 it makes a change from comparing cameras, blisters and outdoor gear. There&apos;s a scruffy little Tibetan market here, where you can buy fake stuff from over the border \u2013 Hortn Face jackets are my favourite. There&apos;s a German bakery too, and an Irish pub, playing Pink Floyd, depressingly. Away from the guest houses, though, the yak bell still rules. After Namche, the landscape opens out. We&apos;ve emerged from the valley now, and it&apos;s bigger, grander, more spectacular. We&apos;re in the mountains proper. There&apos;s Everest, still distant and partially hidden behind Lhotse (8,516m), but at least it looks mightier now. Less high, but steeper and more beautiful is Ama Dablam (6,812m). I can see the magnetic pull the mountains have, can understand why those early tweeded chaps like my grandfather came here and set about planning how to overcome them. Especially the big one of course. It still took 32 years, from that first reconnaissance expedition to Everest&apos;s eventual conquest by Tenzing and Hillary in 1953. Now, of course, the queue goes all the way to the top. Practically. We&apos;re still passing through settlements, at 4,000m, full of people going about their business. In the village of Mong, I give the prayer wheel and extra spin to purify the soul of Ricky Gervais. There are still plenty of trekkers even after we branch off from the route up to base camp. I did think it might feel more like a wilderness. And if I come back again to walk in the Himalayas, which I hope I will, I will go to a less popular part. But \u2013 and it&apos;s a big but \u2013 there is a reason why people are here. Well, Everest for one, the highest mountain in the world. But also the staggering, spectacular beauty.     Sam on the top of Gokyo Ri    The lakes at Gokyo are green and cold. We get up early to climb Gokyo Ri, the hill above, for the famous view. There isn&apos;t one today though: it&apos;s clouded over. I can&apos;t take the photograph I was going to, to hang at the top of the stairs next to my grandfather&apos;s. &quot;At 17,500 feet with Everest in the distance. Photograph SJ Wollaston, 2011&quot; the caption might have said. It doesn&apos;t matter. It wouldn&apos;t have been from where he took his; that was round the other side. And it&apos;s still pretty incredible here, even in cloud. I do find him, on the way back down again. We have another day in Namche, to go and see the yeti scalp at the monastery in nearby Khumjung, to buy yak bells in the market, or to just sit and gaze at Ama Dablam. There&apos;s a little museum here, with photos and stuff from the expeditions. Including a picture of the 1921 team. Eight chaps inappropriately dressed in wool and tweed, they look as if they&apos;re off salmon fishing in Scotland or something. Sitting on the left is George Mallory, who would die on Everest three years later having possibly \u2013 just possibly \u2013 climbed it.

The campaign, Taibbi predicts, &quot;will be disappointing, embarrassing, and over very quickly, like a hand job in a Bangkok bathhouse. And everybody knows it.&quot;      Except, of course, that it won&apos;t really be over very quickly: there are still six more months to go.  It&apos;s not that important issues aren&apos;t at stake: they are. But those issues are sufficiently divisive that it&apos;s in neither candidate&apos;s interest to focus on them much \u2013\u00a0a choice that meshes nicely with the media&apos;s preference for storm-in-a-teacup feuds and micro-scandals. High-minded types might argue that this situation is bad for democracy, but election campaigns often trundle along quite happily for months on such fare, just as long as there&apos;s a John McCain, say, or a Herman Cain, to provide them.  What&apos;s becoming alarmingly clear now is that we&apos;re entering a very different phase. Between the hyper-caution of Obama and the probable robot status of Mitt Romney, the supply of comedy distractions is running dangerously low. Most political news stories don&apos;t matter \u2013 but when they don&apos;t matter and they&apos;re not entertaining, you&apos;ve got problems. One of the fascinating (no, really!) things about this all-pervading dullness is that the presidential candidates \u2013 the two people who indubitably care, even if others don&apos;t \u2013 seem to be feeling it, too. OK, so perhaps I&apos;m just imagining deep boredom in the expression Obama is wearing in his Rolling Stone photoshoot. (Or perhaps he&apos;s just bored of the photoshoot.) But as this Atlantic Wire photo compilation makes clear, I&apos;m certainly not imagining it in the case of his rival. Because Mitt Romney \u2013\u00a0the same Mitt Romney whose whole problem, as a campaigner, is his apparent inability to express or even simulate any genuine human emotion in public \u2013\u00a0turns out to have a capacity for expressing boredom that is positively soulful. Look at him watching Michele Bachmann speak last week:     Photograph: Reuters    Or receiving a souvenir towel at the NBA playoffs:      Photograph: Reuters    Suddenly, he&apos;s no longer a robot, but almost \u2013 in the hackneyed test of likability in American presidential elections \u2013 the kind of guy with whom you&apos;d like to share a beer at a barbecue. It would have to be a very boring barbecue, and you&apos;d have to restrict your topics of conversation to how boring the barbecue was. But at least, you&apos;d have connected. Is it crazily optimistic to imagine that some good might come of all this boringness?  Taibbi seems hopeful that the absence of trivial distractions might force the focus of debate onto more important issues. Perhaps. Meanwhile, maybe the boredom itself could be good for the soul. We know, for example, that being bored is central to the creative process. And isn&apos;t there something almost awe-inspiring about the prospect of a presidential race with so little to stimulate? It&apos;s generally held that the only way to find serenity amid the ceaseless distractions of modern media is to throw out your TV, or to go on a digital diet \u2013 to distance yourself from the frenzy. But what happens when, right at the centre of the frenzy, there&apos;s nothing? Maybe, the result is boredom.

The stories coming out of the US about British involvement in foiling an &quot;underwear&quot; bomb plot were not up for discussion here, even as every major media outlet in America seemed to be standing up the story. Their reticence is understandable, especially if the agent who infiltrated al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) is a British citizen. After all, recruiting &quot;human intelligence&quot; (agents) is what they do, and guaranteeing agents&apos; safety \u2013 and anonymity \u2013 is part of the golden handshake that is required to keep the information flowing. There is also the thorny, potentially highly embarrassing issue of whether this agent provided the intelligence that led to the assassination by American &apos;drone&apos; of the AQAP leader, Fahd al-Quso. The UK doesn&apos;t allow its agents to provide information that could lead to killing in this way. But all this remains speculation, and even the accounts from the US differ in many respects. If staff at Thames House, the home of MI5, and Vauxhall Cross, the headquarters of MI6, have been a little exasperated by the leaks from &apos;the cousins&apos;, that has to be weighed against the advantages of being put at the heart of what appears to have been a great coup. Some reflected glory will do British intelligence no harm at all, especially at MI6. Its boss, Sir John Sawers, known as &apos;C&apos;, has a great deal on his plate at the moment, and none of it looks very appetising. Last week, he was apologising &quot;unreservedly&quot; for MI6&apos;s conduct over the death of Gareth Williams, the codebreaker whose body was found in a zipped-up bag in his bathroom. This week, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, Bernard Hogan-Howe, was waving his truncheon at him, saying the agency was not above the law. The commissioner said he may ask MI6 employees to undergo DNA tests as part of his ongoing inquiry into Williams&apos;s mysterious death. Then there is the case of Abdel Hakim Belhaj, the former Libyan exile, now head of Tripoli&apos;s military council. He was abducted in Bangkok in 2004, and was being flown to one of Gaddafi&apos;s prisons where he says he was repeatedly tortured. MI6 appears to have been instrumental in this alleged rendition, and Belhaj is suing a senior former MI6 officer he blames for his role in what happened. The claims about the UK&apos;s complicity in torture, which affect both services, have not gone away either. There is another vexed issue that has affected MI5, MI6, Scotland Yard&apos;s anti-terrorist branch and GCHQ. All of the UK&apos;s security services say they have been affected by US anger that confidential information provided by the CIA was disclosed in the civil case brought by the British resident Binyam Mohamed, who ended up in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. The evidence to court indicated Mohamed had been mistreated and tortured, which was embarrassing enough. The US was also furious that its intelligence could be made public in this way, citing the &apos;control principle&apos; that demands the owner of the information has final say on whether it can be passed on or revealed. The Foreign Office said breaching the principle endangered UK national security because the US would be nervous of giving full disclosure in future. Although this has to be put in context, senior investigators spoken to by the Guardian say the Americans have been more wary than usual since then, and they haven&apos;t been shy about making digs in private either. Their jibes will look a little more sanctimonious as James Clapper, the US director of national intelligence, begins his inquiry into how so much information about the underwear operation has ended up in the media.", "publicationDate": "2012-05-11T11:27:03Z", "tags": ["MI6", "UK security and counter-terrorism", "World news", "Yemen", "Middle East and North Africa", "MI5", "UK news", "Counter-terrorism policy"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/may/11/underwear-bomb-plot-british-role", "title": "Underwear bomb plot: British officials maintain wall of silence", "sentences": ["He was abducted in Bangkok in 2004, and was being flown to one of Gaddafi&apos;s prisons where he says he was repeatedly tortured."]}, {"article": "First they came for Weetabix. Now a second giant Asian corporation is eyeing our fish fingers. A Thai food manufacturer has tabled a \u00a32.5bn bid for Birds Eye, the British frozen food firm whose avuncular captain has overseen the seafood initiation of millions of tiny mouths. The firm, part of the Iglo group, has its home under the Heathrow flight path in Feltham and employs 2,500 people. The proposed fish-finger grab has come barely a week after a Chinese firm, the state-owned Bright Foods, bought a controlling stake in the breakfast cereal maker Weetabix. The potential buyer of Birds Eye, CP Foods, is part of Charoen Pokphand, a Bangkok-listed group with global businesses employing 280,000 staff worldwide. It claims to be the world&apos;s largest producer of animal feed and shrimp, and its Thai food sales dwarf even Birds Eye&apos;s. CP Foods also has operations in Britain producing Thai food for supermarkets. Permira, the private-equity firm, put the Birds Eye Iglo group up for sale in March, five years after buying it from Unilever for \u00a31.4bn. It recently reported a 7% cent rise in annual profits to \u00a3267m on the back of rising sales of frozen fish, poultry and vegetables. At least two other private-equity investors, Blackstone and BC partners, are reported to be making rival offers for Birds Eye.

Despite the common conception, there&apos;s little doubt that, these days, China&apos;s so-called clones are more than just copycats. Compared to Twitter, for example, Sina Weibo regularly evolves and adds elements to its user experience, such as a video site, games, applications group chat, comment feature and more. However, it remains to be seen whether this innovative, flexible approach gives them the global potential to take on the originals, as ZDNet Asia suggests. Sina Weibo and co are only active in China, but they have already built formidable user bases \u2014 which includes a sprinkling of overseas users \u2014 and hold their weight favourably in comparison with the top western equivalents: \u2022 Facebook: social network \u2013 900 million registered users \u2022 Twitter: microblogging service \u2013 140 million active* users \u2022 LinkedIn: professional social network \u2013 161 million registered users \u2022 Sina Weibo: microblogging service \u2013 300 million registered users (reported 100 million active* users per day) \u2022 Tencent Weibo: microblogging service \u2013 300 million registered users \u2022 Renren: social network \u2013 137 million active* users \u2022 Kaixin001: social network \u2013 120 million registered users *Note the difference between active users number and (total) registered users While they have been successfully adopted by large numbers of China&apos;s 500 million plus internet users, that doesn&apos;t mean that they will thrive at that rate if pushed out to the rest of the world. Need for differentiation in a congested space Today&apos;s social media landscape is a congested and consolidated one that is not easy for new services to enter, particularly those that fail to offer clear differentiation over what already exists and used by millions. This struggle to be unique would be a clear challenge for China&apos;s social networks were they to expand worldwide. Tencent Weibo has embraced English the most actively \u2013 offering a translated service for non-Chinese users \u2013 but, as Tech Rice notes, this is very much an experimental move, rather than a calculated play to beat Twitter and Facebook on their home turf. The Sina Weibo website remains available in Chinese only, but any move to embrace English would likely be to appeal to those in the surrounding regions, particularly Southeast Asia \u2014 where Chinese culture has roots and the country continues to exert influence \u2014 rather than &apos;global&apos; markets. Irrespective, the lion&apos;s share of content on these services is in Chinese, which severely reduces the benefit they can offer users, even with an English user interface. That issue is particularly notable when Twitter and a whole host of other services are available in English and local languages, providing a more informative and useful service. Plenty of work still to do in China Aside from the challenge of competition, Chinese social networking giants still have a lot of work to do in their home country with their core services. Weibo microblogs, in particular, have become key platforms through which news is broken, making the platform increasingly attractive to internet users in the country, despite the state&apos;s efforts to restrict the medium&apos;s influence. Access to the internet continues to grow in China, meaning that market saturation, which Facebook faces in the US, is not a big deal for Chinese social networks. Authorities estimate the number of internet users in the country could reach 800 million by 2015, as Tech In Asia reports. China is fast approaching 600 million web users already and this prospective growth, while optimistic, is feasible and would provide a growing source of new users. Effects of real-name regulation The challenge of recruiting more users is set to become increasingly important as the effects of the country&apos;s real-name regulations, which requires users to verify their accounts with official ID, are felt. The currently large registered user numbers for Weibo services are likely to drop significantly as spam and inactive users are removed from the services, once the rule is fully implemented. This process is still very much playing out but, with Sina conceding that just 60% of its user base is likely to be verified, services will need to focus on recruiting new users and encouraging increased activity in China. That is a significant challenge in itself and, with China the core market, it should take precedent over any attempt to expand overseas. Generating revenue a priority China&apos;s microblogs are struggling to turn in profit, particularly with the cost of operations, content licensing, infrastructure and more weighing down their financial reports. While Sina and Tencent in particular have other businesses that can support Weibo services, both are keen to develop their revenue streams and see profit from the platforms in the near future. Mobile is a key part of potential monetisation, and China&apos;s social networks are not alone in needing to build smartphone strategies. The issue is also concerning Facebook, as it seeks to generate fresh streams of income and provide a better user experience for mobile users. The concern isn&apos;t limited to social networks either. Baidu, the country&apos;s Google-like search giant, is focused on developing its mobile play in China, where official statistics claim there are 356 million mobile web users. More than just being a distraction from more pressing priorities, any initiative to target overseas users would also be a costly operation, if done correctly. Given the requirement for differentiation, any move to woo those outside of China would require a sizeable budget for product development and marketing, not to mention additional infrastructure. There would also be little guarantee of tangible success and return in investment. As it stands, Weibo services offer advertising potential for international firms through their focus on China. For example, a Baidu advertising reseller just moved into Australia, where a number of industries \u2013 particularly in travel and leisure \u2013 are targeting increasingly affluent Chinese consumers. Other organisations are taking to the Chinese social media space, albeit with initially mixed results, but social networks are seen as a key platform towards reaching the increasingly prosperous middle and upper classes in the country. Weibo, as a dedicated Chinese service, offers a platform to reach these audiences, as do other Chinese social networks. Keeping its overseas investment low, the company can already count on growing interest and international advertising dollars for its audience in China. Southeast Asia a more likely focus than &apos;global&apos; On the face of it, Chinese social networks have enough priorities in China to keep them occupied but there are no guarantees. Global moves themselves would not make sense, for reasons outlined above, but local markets like south-east Asia could develop into new promising &quot;spill-over&quot; markets for China&apos;s social network. Tencent has already begun tapping this potential with the introduction of its Weixin mobile chat application into the region, branded We Chat. The company&apos;s messaging services are tightly integrated to its Weibo service so, if it sees success in the region, it could follow up with a more sustained social media push. Meanwhile, Baidu revealed plans for a Singapore-based research centre earlier this year, as it develops its understanding and capacity to introduce relevant new services into the region. The company is also rumoured to be setting up an office in Latin America but, as critics have pointed out, it will need to adequately differentiate itself from its rivals if it is to stand a chance of succeeding there. Baidu is in a position where, as a search engine, it makes more sense to expand its service worldwide, but for China&apos;s social networks, the benefits of full-on international expansion are currently outweighed by focusing on the domestic market \u2026 for now, at least.

But in the process, you may pick up some less desirable local habits, such as ignoring traffic rules, ditching the helmet and having a drink or two before setting off. Big mistake. Thailand ranks worst in the world for motorbike and two-wheeler casualties, with more than 11,000 motorbike drivers or passengers dying annually. Official statistics suggest such incidents account for 70% of the country&apos;s road fatalities. Many die because they don&apos;t wear a helmet. According to a Motorcycle Safety Foundation report, unhelmeted riders in Thailand are between two and three times more likely to be killed, and three times likelier to suffer a &quot;disastrous outcome&quot;. Thailand&apos;s government introduced a &quot;year of the helmet&quot; in 2010 and is following up with a 100% helmet use campaign to highlight the danger of riding unprotected. Both schemes are part of an ambitious &quot;master plan on road safety&quot; aimed at hitting the UN target \u2013 set by the organisation&apos;s decade of action for road safety (pdf) \u2013 of fewer than 10 deaths per 100,000 people. Yet Thailand remains wildly off the mark; only 47% of those driving or riding pillion wear helmets. Official figures suggest neighbouring Asian countries fare little better, with motorbikes accounting for 61% of fatalities in Indonesia, 58% in Malaysia and 62.8% in Cambodia. The region&apos;s high statistics are partly explained by the preference for cheap and easy motorbikes over cars, and their resulting ubiquity. But Ratanawadee H Winther, of the Bangkok-based Asia Injury Prevention Foundation (AIPF) \u2013 working with the Thai government and key stakeholders to meet road safety targets \u2013 believes there are also cultural reasons, not least a seeming indifference to safety precautions. &quot;Thai people still lack awareness and take safety very lightly,&quot; says Winther. &quot;They&apos;re also very superstitious when it comes to death \u2013 for example, they believe someone will not die if they&apos;re not &apos;meant&apos; to.&quot; Dr Witaya Chadbunchachai, the director of the trauma and critical care centre of Khon Kaen regional hospital&apos;s centre for injury prevention and safety promotion, which collaborates with the World Health Organisation, believes Thailand&apos;s rapid industrialisation is also a factor.\u00a0 &quot;Mass public transport is insufficient and ineffective,&quot; he says. &quot;We see wider, better roads into villages, but they&apos;ve not been designed with safety in mind, and we have a high volume of vehicles on the roads \u2013 22m motorcycles and 6m cars. It&apos;s too easy to get a driver&apos;s licence \u2026 and just because a driver has a licence doesn&apos;t mean he&apos;s a good driver.&quot; Both Winther and Chadbunchachai say unlicensed motorbike drivers are common because a lack of viable public transport means motorbikes are used for everyday tasks including carrying large and bulky items, driving at night (often under the influence), and going to school, work or the market. Many motorbike riders are under driving age.\u00a0 &quot;Most students who live rurally have to go to school but are below the driving age of 18, so to get around they use motorbikes,&quot; explains Winther. &quot;The police don&apos;t want to punish them for their situation, so they usually let them go on their way.&quot; Activists claim better police enforcement is crucial to Thailand meeting its targets. But police reluctance, coupled with low fines, renders the law ineffectual. &quot;The penalty is not severe enough,&quot; says Winther. &quot;It doesn&apos;t make people afraid.&quot; The government is inattentive towards its safety programme, depending on partners to help roll out national programmes, says Arun Pinta of Thailand&apos;s Road Safety Directing Centre. The centre, responsible for Thailand&apos;s road safety initiatives, is part of the same disaster mitigation and prevention department that deals with floods, earthquakes and land development. &quot;There is a lot to do,&quot; says Pinta. This month, the AIPF and the government are piloting the Thailand helmet vaccine initiative, aimed at achieving a 100% helmet-wearing rate among children. The message is that wearing a helmet is an effective &quot;vaccine&quot; against injury or death, and the most effective way of protecting children on the roads. The pilot is part of a worldwide initiative to increase helmet use led by the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, AIPF and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, among others. It will build capacity among police and parents and work on public campaigns and education. The goal in Thailand, says Winther, is to focus on helmet provision, technical assistance and awareness through schools. But activists also want technology such as speed cameras, radar guns and breathalysers. &quot;If we had a 100% helmet rate, we&apos;d save 3,000 lives every year, and 100,000 people would have fewer injuries and disabilities,&quot; argues Chadbunchachai. &quot;Around 80% of those who die from motorbike accidents suffer head injuries, and roughly 5% of those admitted to hospital from motorbike accidents end up handicapped \u2013 that&apos;s about 40,000-50,000 people. They have spinal or head injuries and become dependent on relatives or parents, unable to work again.&quot; According to Winther, helmet use depends on affordability, availability \u2013 children&apos;s helmets are often found only in larger cities, for example \u2013 and design. &quot;In Thailand, standard-issue helmets are very heavy because they are based on EU standards, which are very stringent but formulated for cold countries where heat is not a problem,&quot; Winther says. &quot;The helmets here are so heavy and ugly, it doesn&apos;t encourage people to wear them.&quot; Despite the difficulties Thailand faces, activists hope targets will eventually be met. &quot;We have the expertise, the knowhow and the financial resources,&quot; says Pinta. &quot;We just need to get more people to wear their helmets.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-05-15T06:00:00Z", "tags": ["Global development", "Road safety", "Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/may/15/thailand-head-start-road-safety", "title": "Thailand's government seeks to get a head start on improving road safety", "sentences": ["But Ratanawadee H Winther, of the Bangkok-based Asia Injury Prevention Foundation (AIPF) \u2013 working with the Thai government and key stakeholders to meet road safety targets \u2013 believes there are also cultural reasons, not least a seeming indifference to safety precautions."]}, {"article": "If there is one thing we know about Joey Barton it is that he won&apos;t go quietly when his latest slump into recidivism catches up with him and the Football Association remove him from the game until some point towards the end of the year. Barton is facing a ban of rare severity and you have to wonder whether the penny will finally drop for all the people who have indulged him. The Queens Park Rangers midfielder had certainly taken a lot of people in before the most conclusive evidence yet that his reinvention as renaissance man was a deception. A pretty good one, in fairness, given that Barton can be charming and eloquent and hold his own in any company. But a deception, nonetheless. He has been rumbled now and there will be little in the way of public sympathy when the disciplinary panel plays the video of his red card last weekend, sees the face of a man who has spent too long in the hurt business and concludes that someone this dedicated to violence merits one of the longer punishments ever handed out. An elbow to the chin, a knee from behind and an attempted butt at Eastlands in Premier League&apos;s final round, together with a previous red card for another bout of unsolicited aggression, could mean a 10- to 15-game ban at Wednesday&apos;s hearing. Ten would take us to the end of October. Fifteen would bring us to December and, by then, who can say where he will have washed up? Barton has already been moved out of Newcastle and Manchester City through the back door and it is clear now that QPR would get rid of him in a shot. After that, Barton has a real problem because the bottom line is there won&apos;t be many clubs queueing up for an \u00a380,000-a-week serial offender. Barton has certainly become a disappointment since the first time I met him in 2004 just as he was breaking into the City team. Everything seemed so much more innocent back then. Barton was unpretentious, streetwise and straight to the point. He was also courteous, generous with his time and without a hint of ego. He was mortified, for example, that another interview had carried the headline: &quot;I&apos;ll be better than Keane, Gerrard and Vieira.&quot; Where he was from, he explained, he would hate to be seen as bigheaded or having ideas above his station. &quot;In many ways, the wiry 21-year-old is a throwback to a different era,&quot; I wrote at the time. &quot;In a game of inflated egos, declining moral standards and the depressing widening in the gulf between players and supporters, an hour in his company actually feels refreshing.&quot; Sometimes in this job there are things you read back that make you wince. Soon afterwards the stories started to come back about the way Barton talked to staff at City. Then followed the first reports that he was dangerous. There was the argument with the YTS trainee that ended with Barton stubbing a cigar into the boy&apos;s eye. Then the pre-season trip to Bangkok when a 15-year-old Everton fan was slapped across the face and the journalists who witnessed it were shocked by the scale of Barton&apos;s temper and where it nearly took him. Very soon everyone in football knew Barton had a fuse like Tommy deVito&apos;s, Joe Pesci&apos;s character in Goodfellas. Treat with caution. Don&apos;t, whatever you do, call him funny. Then we came to City&apos;s end-of-season dinner in 2007 when Barton had started to think of himself as the most important member of the team only for Richard Dunne to win the player-of-the-year award. Staff at City are convinced this contributed to what happened two days later, when Barton attacked Ousmane Dabo from behind, punched him to the floor and then carried on hitting him even when he was unconscious. Barton was already in prison by the time the court case came around, this time for raining blow after blow on a teenager in Liverpool city centre. Watching from the press benches at Manchester Crown Court, the stand-out moment was not the sight of a Premier League footballer being taken down in handcuffs, it was the people in the public gallery, sitting forward in their chairs, staring at Dabo on the opposite side of the room. They never took their eyes off him for a second. Forgive me then for never fully going along with the Barton roadshow and all the talk of a reformed character, when you never had to wait too long before the next round of malevolence on Twitter or threat of menace. It is just that everyone is so pathetically grateful to see a footballer with a bit of personality these days, Barton was embraced as some kind of class experiment and broadsheet pin-up. Barton popped in for morning conference at the Guardian (charming, apparently), appeared on Newsnight and got a book deal, to be ghosted by a Times columnist. The working-class lad from Liverpool became a subject of fascination. Wasn&apos;t it great, his fan club said, to find someone who saw blandness as his enemy? Well, yes, to a point. Football is littered with people who are as colourless as water. It is the way they are media trained: to see little and say even less. So thank heavens there will always be the odd rogue. It was just there was always going to be a time, between quoting Smiths lyrics and Googling Nietzsche, when Barton showed he is not as clever as he would like to think. &quot;Why do people always want to solve any conflict with a fight?&quot; he asked on Twitter. &quot;As a pacifist, I find it incredible.&quot; How he must have laughed from behind his keyboard. A personal theory is that Barton craves attention, maybe born out of insecurity. The violence is one thing, but it is made even more unappealing by the fact that his default setting is self-justification and denial. As for his abilities as a footballer, perhaps the best way to sum it up is that the fourth-worst team in the Premier League were looking to move him on even before his latest return to ignominy. Barton made more inaccurate passes, 490, in the opposition half than any other top-division player last season. Manchester United were linked with him last summer and Sir Alex Ferguson was bewildered. &quot;What kind of manager do they think I am?&quot; he asked of the newspaper that printed it. All of which is a far cry from how Barton appears to see himself when he talks of being accomplished enough to play for England and excluded only because of the baggage he brings. There will be more of that, presumably, in his book. More spite and settling of old scores. You quickly learn with Barton it&apos;s never his fault. And for a while, the deception almost worked.", "publicationDate": "2012-05-19T21:50:01Z", "tags": ["Joey Barton", "QPR", "Football", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/may/19/joey-barton-qpr-violence-renaissance-man", "title": "Joey Barton's latest act of violence proves he is no renaissance man | Daniel Taylor", "sentences": ["Then the pre-season trip to Bangkok when a 15-year-old Everton fan was slapped across the face and the journalists who witnessed it were shocked by the scale of Barton&apos;s temper and where it nearly took him."]}, {"article": "Lazy days Thailand&apos;s Apichatpong Weerasethakul showed his experimental, hour-long film Mekong Hotel.

Yet some good examples of shared value are emerging, especially in the developing countries where access to medicine can be an acute challenge. One example is from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in Thailand. Globally, GSK has made it a priority to increase access to medicine and bring pricing in line with gross national income (GNI). It seems to have done a good job, having topped the Access to Medicine Index in 2008 and 2010. In Thailand, GSK&apos;s country office developed the Medicine Bank initiative to increase access to medicine while building trust locally by partnering with the Thai Red Cross and Royal Thai Army to provide and deliver medicine and sanitary supplies. The partnership with the Thai Red Cross sets out to provide health education and vaccines to the underprivileged for illnesses that are the main causes of death among young children in Thailand, including infant diarrhoea, influenza and pneumonia. GSK has put huge efforts into vaccinating children at particular risk. Around 13,200 of them have been vaccinated since June 2011, many of them street kids and orphans, who can be challenging to convince to come back to complete the required doses. GSK also provides medical and sanitary supplies to the Royal Thai Army, which has the role of distributing relief to distressed areas across Thailand such as the conflict zone in the south and areas that were rendered inaccessible during the floods in late 2011. Distribution takes place in partnership with a mobile medical unit whereby GSK staff and doctors accompany the Thai Red Cross or Royal Thai Army to rural areas. The Thai partners welcome the health expertise of GSK&apos;s staff and having them along relieves some of the burden on their own overstretched staff and doctors. The programme is a great example of a company creating value and maximising its social impact by finding meaningful ways to deliver its own core products and services outside the usual marketplace. This has become the norm in CSR strategies, and the public has grown to expect it of their trusted brands. Companies can contribute available resources and expertise at little additional cost. Meanwhile, it offers them a chance to understand their market better, improve their products and services and meet other business needs. According to Thavirap Tantiwongse, GSK&apos;s public affairs director in Thailand, the Medicine Bank gets GSK staff out of their &apos;ivory tower&apos; and gives them a chance to understand the needs of the people they are trying to serve and the conditions where medicines are being administered. It gets them to the grassroots, so to speak. Working in partnership also helps to overcome the negative perception of pharmaceutical companies, which hinders their licence to operate. Thailand has a strong culture of health activists demanding that medicine be provided for free which is a significant barrier to GSK&apos;s ability to do regular business. The partnership with the Thai Red Cross, for example, has changed the attitudes at important government hospitals, making them much more open to purchasing medicines from the company. Providing greater access to medicine is one of the clearest examples of demonstrating social responsibility by directing core skills and resources towards a social need that can increase the overall sustainability of a business. But there are many more such examples across Asia. Working in partnership with not-for-profit organisations is a strong component of many of them. The total value of the medicine donated through the Medicine Bank is approximately \u00a3500,000. It&apos;s a significant initiative. But does it completely resolve GSK&apos;s struggle against the negative perceptions of the pharmaceutical industry, or would an even deeper collaboration help more? With initiatives that are both socially and financially effective, there is scope to cover larger areas and reach more people to provide greater value both to the business and to communities?

Officials said they uncovered an &quot;international network&quot; nine days ago when Lindsay Sandiford, 55, originally from Redcar in Teesside, was stopped as she arrived at Bali&apos;s Ngurah Rai international airport on a Thai Airways flight from Bangkok. After an x-ray machine picked up an odd package in her suitcase, customs officers found 4.7kg of cocaine concealed in its lining, they said. Sandiford is reported to have told police that she had agreed to make the trip only because her children, who are in England, were being\u00a0threatened. According to the Australian Associated Press news agency, Sandiford, who is described on immigration documents as a housewife, then agreed to help the authorities catch the other alleged members of the gang, another three Britons and an Indian national. On Monday, Sandiford tried to cover her face as she was presented to the media by a group of armed and masked officers in the Balinese town of Kuta, which is popular with holidaymakers. She shielded her eyes with her hands as officials loaded several packages wrapped in brown tape on to the table in front of her, before weighing them and cutting them open with a knife. The other four suspects were also paraded for the media, although they had their faces hidden behind black balaclavas and were wearing prison jumpsuits and flip-flops. Two days after her arrest on 19 May, Sandiford was contacted by another British woman, identified by the initials RLD, and a meeting was arranged. Following a police sting operation, RLD and two British men, referred to as BP and JAP, were arrested, along with the Indian national. The head of Bali&apos;s drugs squad said BP and JAP were believed to be senior figures in a drug-smuggling syndicate, adding: &quot;It&apos;s an international network controlled from abroad.&quot; The Jakarta Post reported that RLD and JAP are married and own a villa in Bali. Indonesia has strict drug laws and convicted smugglers are executed. More than 140 people are on death row, a third of them foreigners. A customs official, Made Wijaya, said the total amount of cocaine recovered from the suitcase was 4.971kg, adding that the drugs had an estimated street value of 23.9bn Indonesian rupiahs (\u00a31.6m). He said the five were likely to be sentenced to death if convicted. &quot;The charge against them would carry the death penalty,&quot; he said. Another 68g of cocaine, 280g of powdered ecstasy and a small amount of hashish were also recovered following the arrest of the other gang members at separate locations in Bali, officials said. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said it was aware of the four arrests and stood &quot;ready to provide consular assistance&quot;, but he declined to comment further. A woman who cleaned for Sandiford when she lived in Cheltenham a decade ago and worked for a firm of solicitors, said she had been stunned to hear of her arrest. &quot;She was friendly, bubbly, she was helpful, she helped me,&quot; Maria Swift told ITV West. &quot;I did a bit of cleaning for\u00a0her, it was just to help her out in general. &quot;I&apos;m just gobsmacked because I didn&apos;t see that side of her and it&apos;s hard to believe that she could work for a legal firm and go from one extreme to another.&quot; Asked if she ever believed Sandiford could become involved in drugs, she replied: &quot;No, no.&quot; Swift said she heard Sandiford had lost her house and moved to another part of Cheltenham but lost contact with her soon after that. Last year, Indonesian officials warned that Bali had become a haven for international drug gangs lured by the millions of tourists who visit the island each year. While police had previously dealt with cases involving hashish, cocaine and heroin, officers said that it was crystal meth \u2013 or shabu-shabu, as it is known locally \u2013 that was proving increasingly popular among drug mules. Indonesia&apos;s anti-drug agency said that Bali \u2013 a Hindu enclave in a Muslim nation that regularly enforces the death penalty for drug offenders \u2013 urgently needed more technology and expertise to stem the flow of drugs, including investment in scanners and other modern screening facilities at its ports and airports. One official, Tommy Sagiman, said that inspectors would do their best to target their searches, &quot;especially with regards [to] foreigners who arrive in Bali&quot;. Last August, a 41-year-old Ugandan woman was found dead in a Kuta hotel room with more than a kilo of plastic-wrapped crystal meth in her intestines, while a month later a South African woman was arrested at Ngurah Rai airport with a similar amount stuffed into her underwear. In March, Edward Norman Myatt, an Australian man who is said to have worked as a hairdresser in London, was caught carrying a kilo of hashish and methamphetamines into the country. He now faces the death penalty. The island&apos;s most famous drugs case to date involves the Bali Nine, a group of Australians who attempted to struggle 8kg of heroin from Bali to Australia in 2005. Two of them face execution by firing squad, while the rest are serving long sentences.", "publicationDate": "2012-05-29T00:20:00Z", "tags": ["Indonesia", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Drugs trade", "Drugs", "UK news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/28/britons-bali-cocaine-plot-death-penalty", "title": "Britons arrested over Bali cocaine-smuggling plot could face death penalty", "sentences": ["Officials said they uncovered an &quot;international network&quot; nine days ago when Lindsay Sandiford, 55, originally from Redcar in Teesside, was stopped as she arrived at Bali&apos;s Ngurah Rai international airport on a Thai Airways flight from Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Anyone watching last week&apos;s Great British Menu could be forgiven for thinking that Wales is leading the way in creative cookery. Well, in many ways it is, but when it comes to eating out the accolades just aren&apos;t coming. For the past two years we have held a measly four Michelin stars (compared with 55 in London). In the Welsh capital you&apos;ll be lucky to get even a few AA rosettes. Of course, a lack of Michelin stars doesn&apos;t necessarily mean a lack of good food, but it does mean that finding a decent restaurant here is harder. Curry houses are aplenty and there are a few good Italian eateries, but if you&apos;re after a vegetarian meal, say, or a contemporary restaurant that pushes the boundaries, it&apos;s a struggle.It&apos;s not like there isn&apos;t a culinary heritage here. Make all the jokes you want about the Welsh penchant for posh cheese on toast, we have some serious recipes and produce under our apron strings: think cawl (a delicious stew), Welsh cakes (flat, sugary, currant scones), laverbread, cockles, salt-marsh lamb, and some of the best cheeses in the world (Caerphilly, anyone?). The British Cheese Awards and festival are held in Cardiff, for goodness sake. So, if it&apos;s not down to the ingredients themselves, does the lack of Michelin recognition reflect a lack of homegrown talent? Well, to look at the contestants and judges on the GBM&apos;s Welsh round, you might think so. Stephen Terry, while admittedly chef patron of one of Wales&apos; most popular (if not Michelin-accredited) restaurants, is originally from London (even if he does have an Abergavenny twang). Judge Angela Hartnett, one of Britain&apos;s leading chefs, is based in London and is only &quot;Welsh&quot; by descent. And although Richard Davies hails from Bridgend, he earned his Michelin star at a manor house in Wiltshire.  It is only James Sommerin in the competition, a &quot;Welsh man through and through&quot;, who has kept to his roots. He has maintained his Michelin star at Monmouthshire restaurant The Crown at Whitebrook for the past six years. That&apos;s no mean feat. He thinks very few great chefs are drawn to Wales: &quot;The majority head towards places like London, where they have the opportunity to earn more money&quot;. One of Wales&apos; best-known chefs did just that. Bryn Williams trained at Le Gavroche and in France before taking over as head chef, then chef patron, at Odette&apos;s, his acclaimed restaurant in Primrose Hill. But it&apos;s unlikely to be about money alone. Perhaps chefs head elsewhere because they don&apos;t have the same opportunity here in Wales to be creative, where cheap and cheerful is often favoured over adventurous gastronomy. Rustic, affordably-priced eateries such as Matt Tebbutt&apos;s gastropub The Foxhunter in the Usk valley and Cardiff&apos;s The Potted Pig exist but are rare gems, as are excellent cheaper eateries such such as the Bangkok Cafe in Swansea. Even the double Michelin-starred Martin Blunos couldn&apos;t make his take on fine dining work at the now defunct Crown Social in Cardiff city centre. And time will only tell if Ceredigion-born chef Roger Jones will fare any better in his new role to raise the standard of Cardiff&apos;s restaurant scene at The Park House. Still, without the support of Michelin, Wales is listed among the top three destinations for gastro tourism in the UK. The annual Abergavenny Food Festival in September is renowned as one of the best food and drink events in the UK. Even the Welsh government is doing its bit with a Food Tourism Action Plan (pdf) and its annual True Taste of Wales Awards. All of the ingredients for a vibrant restaurant scene are here. So, is Wales a victim of Michelin snobbery, is London pinching all the best chefs, or is this fiercely proud country simply taking its time to be the best it can be? I favour the latter: the foundations are laid, and now we just need the public&apos;s support to take Welsh restaurants to the next level.", "publicationDate": "2012-05-29T09:10:00Z", "tags": ["Restaurants", "British food and drink", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Wales holidays"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/may/29/wales-michelin-stars-will-rise", "title": "Wales' Michelin stars will rise", "sentences": ["Rustic, affordably-priced eateries such as Matt Tebbutt&apos;s gastropub The Foxhunter in the Usk valley and Cardiff&apos;s The Potted Pig exist but are rare gems, as are excellent cheaper eateries such such as the Bangkok Cafe in Swansea."]}, {"article": "Sylvia, 77 We used the phrase &quot;becoming lovers&quot; back in the 1950s \u2013 to become someone&apos;s lover was a big\u00a0step, whereas it isn&apos;t now. Now people just have sexual encounters. I became lovers with a\u00a0sophisticated lawyer I met on a skiing holiday. When we got back to England, I discovered that he was married, but I was hooked by then. We carried on together for 11 years, and by the time it ended, it was too late. Our relationship ruined my life, because no one else came up to what he meant to me. Why does one like some people and not others? I\u00a0don&apos;t know if it&apos;s something you can put your finger on. It&apos;s just chemistry in the end. I haven&apos;t had a relationship for a\u00a0long time, so\u00a0it&apos;s a bit difficult to think about it. It would be\u00a0nice\u00a0to have someone to go out with, but men\u00a0are\u00a0not terribly interested in older women. I\u00a0do have a\u00a0young gay friend \u2013 he&apos;s only 28, but he&apos;s been a\u00a0wonderful friend. Steven, 40 In my 20s, I lived for several years with a girl who wanted to settle down, but I hadn&apos;t got the wild streak out of my system. After that, I\u00a0went berserk and I&apos;ve not settled down since. I have days when I&apos;d like someone to be around, but about 90% of the time it doesn&apos;t even occur. I&apos;ve always got some project on the go. I think this is just my life card; I&apos;ve never had to consider anyone else and I\u00a0don&apos;t think I&apos;d be capable of it now. There are times when I wonder if I&apos;ve made the right decision \u2013 Christmas is painful on your own \u2013 but you&apos;re not telling me that people in relationships don&apos;t feel the same thing. They may lie and say they&apos;re happy, but I&apos;m a therapist: I\u00a0see people who have been in loveless marriages for 25 years and they are riddled with stress and disease because they&apos;re constantly unhappy. This concept of love that we&apos;re exposed to by the media is all fake. It&apos;s the\u00a0stuff of Hollywood. The one thing I do not like about being single is that you&apos;re always viewed with suspicion. Did you watch The Killing on BBC4? It turns out that the killer was the fortysomething single bloke. And you think, great, thanks for that. Stella, 59 I&apos;ve got so used to being on my own, I barely think about it. One of my oldest friends got married at 21 and is still happily married. I remember saying to her, &quot;Oh, you were lucky when you married Bruce&quot;, and she said, &quot;No, it wasn&apos;t luck.&quot; She meant she&apos;d thought about it. She knew he&apos;d be a\u00a0good husband and father in the long term, and he was all of those things. But you don&apos;t usually think like that when you&apos;re young. You go with the heart. I&apos;d like to find love. When I lie in bed on a\u00a0Sunday morning having a cup of tea, I think, &apos;Wouldn&apos;t it be nice to have someone next to you, someone to chat to about the day.&apos; I&apos;d like to travel again and I&apos;d like someone to do it with. It doesn&apos;t have to be LOVE in capital letters. You&apos;ve got over that heady lust thing, which gets in the way. It&apos;s companionship more than anything as you get older. Andy, 47 I&apos;ve never been in a long-term relationship. I\u00a0don&apos;t scare horses in the street, but I don&apos;t think other gay people get me. I came to London when I\u00a0was 30, thinking I&apos;d have a\u00a0better chance of\u00a0meeting someone. I&apos;ve been here ever since. I\u00a0think it&apos;s\u00a0harder at my age, as a\u00a0gay man, to\u00a0find love. At 47, you basically don&apos;t\u00a0exist. Gay culture is so youth-oriented. It&apos;s\u00a0like you&apos;re fighting a\u00a0competition with foetuses in tight little\u00a0T-shirts and you don&apos;t stand\u00a0a chance. So you think, &quot;OK, that&apos;s it then \u2013 I&apos;m just going to have to be the slightly eccentric outsider who everyone loves and who sits in his flat eating tinned salmon. I can deal with that.&quot; Then, all of a sudden, the goalposts move. I\u00a0had no choice when I was growing up \u2013 we wouldn&apos;t have dreamed of getting married or having children. That&apos;s why our parents were so\u00a0sad when we came out as gay, because it wasn&apos;t an option. Now gay people are having it all. They\u00a0have the joint mortgage, the going out to antique shops and buying lovely things, dinner parties and the biggest, campest wedding you ever dreamed of, and you think, &quot;I really have missed the boat here. I&apos;m not even at the\u00a0dock!&quot; So it is awful, really, on some level. It does compound the feeling of loneliness. Mary, 85 The man I was going to marry was killed on a\u00a0bombing mission during the war. I met Jimmy\u00a0dancing. I was 19 and he was 21. But then\u00a0he was posted. He used to write every day\u00a0and tell me where he&apos;d been on his missions. Then one day I\u00a0got a letter from his mother telling me that he was missing \u2013 his plane had been shot down. All of them were killed. He is buried in France. I&apos;ve been over there several times. It&apos;s very sad. Eventually, his\u00a0mother wrote\u00a0and said to me, &quot;You must stop grieving, you can&apos;t go on for ever. You have\u00a0to meet someone else.&quot; But nobody ever\u00a0came up to his standard and it&apos;s been like that all my life. I always knew I would join the army myself \u2013 I\u00a0served for 22 years. After that, I travelled, and that took the place of marriage. If I could tell you\u00a0all the places I&apos;ve visited: Jerusalem, Israel, Bangkok, Hong Kong. I even went round Borneo in a cargo ship once. I&apos;ve had boyfriends along the way, but Jimmy was the one and only. Elizabeth, 42 I&apos;ve had quite a few one-night stands, but I&apos;m not somebody who was made to have boyfriends. It&apos;s not in my make up. I&apos;m independent and I\u00a0don&apos;t want to be like everyone else. I like to tell tales of where I&apos;ve been and what I&apos;ve done. Me, as Elizabeth: I like to represent myself. I think it&apos;s harder for my parents. I found out recently from one of my sisters that my dad thought I was a\u00a0lesbian because they&apos;d never met any of my boyfriends, but I couldn&apos;t tell them about the\u00a0flings. It is nice to have intimacy and touch \u2013 I hug people all the time \u2013 but because I haven&apos;t been with anyone sexually for a while, I&apos;ve lost my appetite. I was in My Fair Lady once and the lead guy had the most beautiful voice. He sang this one song, On The Street Where You Live, and I\u00a0said, &quot;Do you know, every time you sing that song, I\u00a0have a feeling of being in love and I love it!&quot; A\u00a0couple of months ago, I thought, &quot;Oh, wouldn&apos;t it be nice to have that feeling\u2026&quot; Some people fall in love at the drop of a hat. Maybe it&apos;s because they need to. I don&apos;t need to\u00a0fall in love. Ash, 34 I have a neuromuscular disability and need the help of a personal care assistant for almost everything I do. I have an exhausting, time-consuming routine: getting up, dressed, washed and fed. Despite this, I hold down a career and have friends. But I don&apos;t have a relationship and it&apos;s something that chips away at me every day. They say that behind every successful man there is a strong woman, and I think that&apos;s true. The only true love I&apos;ve had has been parental love and I think that, if I was in a relationship, my natural instinct would be to reflect this. I\u00a0would set very high standards for myself, and I&apos;m almost certain that I couldn&apos;t come anywhere near meeting them. With my physical limitations, I\u00a0would not be able to put an arm around my partner, or give them a hug or a kiss when they don&apos;t expect it but I feel that they really need it. I was always aware I couldn&apos;t be a full part of the normal lives other people were having. So in\u00a0many ways I felt a loner. But the most real part\u00a0of me is intimate, passionate and generous, and I\u00a0need to be in a relationship for that to come\u00a0out. Stacey, 38 I always thought it was a given that one day I\u00a0would marry and have children. Obviously, I&apos;ve\u00a0got my mum, who adores me, but other than my family, I don&apos;t really feel like I&apos;ve got support. My\u00a0friends have partners, so I play a smaller part in their lives, while they play a\u00a0bigger part in mine. I&apos;ve begun to get more involved in my own\u00a0thing recently: I keep fit and do courses at the weekend. I think it&apos;s important to find love. I can&apos;t imagine what will replace not doing that, because I&apos;ve done everything else I&apos;ve wanted to. I&apos;ve travelled the world with my job, and I&apos;ve now given that up so I\u00a0can meet someone. I think it&apos;s the sense of belonging I hanker after. My sisters are twins, three years older than me, so when I was growing up they were always so much closer than I was. If I was 45, I&apos;d be more worried. I do have confidence in myself, but I don&apos;t want to be the one at parties who&apos;s on their own, with everyone saying, &quot;Oh, where are your kids? Oh, you don&apos;t have any. Sorry.&quot; Chris, 63 I was an only child, raised by my mother and two aunts, all of whom had strong Methodist leanings. I was always intensely aware of a &quot;wrongness&quot; inherent in any sexual desires. I once actually touched a girl&apos;s breasts through her clothes and I\u00a0was sure the thundering in my ears was the sound of the hooves of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, coming to get me. At 19, I fell in love with a girl, but our relationship was platonic. The next 27 years of my life were taken up with family concerns as elderly relatives got ill, degenerated and died. Funerals arranged: seven. Sexual relationships: zero. I did feel a sense of frustration. I\u00a0felt like a taxi stuck in traffic, the meter clicking away on my life. Living alone in my mid-50s, I did have a fleeting romance with a lovely but very troubled woman in her 30s. Alas, there was no chance of\u00a0it lasting. A dream world has been my saviour, inhabited by many of the women I&apos;ve been fortunate enough to meet. Astonishingly, though, through the internet, I&apos;ve recently met up with my teenage love. It&apos;s been 44 years since we last met. She&apos;s still beautiful, kind and bats about me. I&apos;m not sure how I will cope with a serious relationship \u2013 I&apos;ve been a solo act my entire life, but something vital has been on hold. It&apos;s quite disturbing, but also wonderful and new. \u2022 Some names have been changed.", "publicationDate": "2012-06-01T22:00:22Z", "tags": ["Relationships", "Life and style", "Psychology", "Society"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jun/01/looking-for-mr-mrs-right", "title": "Single file: confessions of men and women who've never met Miss/Mr Right", "sentences": ["If I could tell you\u00a0all the places I&apos;ve visited: Jerusalem, Israel, Bangkok, Hong Kong."]}, {"article": "One of the British women accused of cocaine smuggling in Bali remained sedated in hospital on Saturday as she continued to protest her innocence. Rachel Dougall, 38, was becoming increasingly frantic as she faced the prospect of execution by firing squad. Speaking from behind bars before she was taken to Bali police hospital, she claimed she was the victim of a sting operation and protested her innocence. &quot;I am hallucinating. I can&apos;t sleep, I can&apos;t eat, I am losing my marbles,&quot; she cried, repeatedly asking after Kitty, her six-year-old-daughter. To Australian ears, the cries of Dougall and her co-accused and partner Julian Ponder that their drug arrest was a &quot;set-up&quot; sound familiar. Almost eight years ago, a young Queensland beautician, Schapelle Corby, pleaded the same defence to accusations that she had smuggled 4.1kg of cannabis into the tropical holiday island. Airport baggage handlers were supposed to have inserted the drugs into Corby&apos;s boogie board bag without her knowledge. Dougall and Ponder, 43, claim betrayal by their co-accused, mother-of-two Lindsay Sandiford, who they say set them up by delivering 4.8kg of cocaine disguised as a present for Kitty&apos;s sixth birthday. The large box containing the cocaine was gift-wrapped in pink paper with &quot;Enjoy sweet candy&quot; printed on it. Sandiford, 55, is claiming to have brought the drugs from Bangkok to Bali in her suitcase lining only because her two sons, Lewis, 23, and Elliot, 21, were threatened with death. A lawyer who unsuccessfully pitched for her business last week revealed that Sandiford believed Ponder to be the ringleader and &quot;a big mafia guy&quot;. But if the sad history of Corby is any guide, these stories will be greeted with disbelief by Indonesian judges. If that is the case, the four Britons and one Indian national arrested over Bali&apos;s biggest cocaine haul will face at best a long and miserable future in Kerobokan prison. At worst, they face a firing squad. Bali is a ravished paradise. The surfers who first discovered its unblemished beaches and intriguing version of Hinduism in the 1960s have been followed by waves of tourists. Development came next, with the pleasure seekers close behind. Now any bule (white foreigner) who walks among the glitzy shops, bars and nightclubs of Kuta beach at night is offered sex as well as heroin, ecstasy, crystal meth and cannabis. Cocaine, by contrast, remains scarce and highly priced. Bali&apos;s customs chief I Made Wijaya valued the seized haul at \u00a3333 per gram, 10 times the price of gold. &quot;Cocaine is very rare,&quot; said one Bali local. &quot;It&apos;s unlikely you&apos;ll find it on the street. It&apos;s for well-funded foreigners and maybe some rich Indonesians.&quot; It&apos;s hard to see why Kerobokan&apos;s razor-wire-topped walls are not a more effective deterrent. More than 1,000 inmates, men and women, sleep in overcrowded cells in a prison designed for fewer than a third of that number. This year a man was beaten to death over the course of about eight hours in one of these cells. Nobody owned up to hearing his screams. Gangs such as the notorious &quot;Laskar Bali&quot;, or &quot;Bali Army&quot;, dominate the yard. Drugs are freely traded and most things, including a bigger cell, can be bought for the right price. Many who arrived clean eventually find their way into drug addiction. In April two successive nights of rioting forced guards to abandon the prison to the inmates, who burned and gutted its administration area and threatened to raze the rest of the building to the ground. Without visitors to bring in palatable food, prisoners go hungry and sometimes crazy. A sentence of 20 years is standard for smuggling drugs. If Sandiford, from Cheltenham, Ponder and Dougall, both of Bali but formerly of Brighton, and the remaining co-accused, Paul Beales and Indian national Nanda Gophal, are jailed there, they will be among the oldest foreigners. But under Indonesia&apos;s drug laws, a haul of this size of any &quot;narkoba&quot; makes the death penalty very likely. Indonesia has 114 death row prisoners, 43 of them foreigners, though it has not executed anybody since 2008. On the day of death the prisoner is led to the place of execution and a target hung around their neck. They can choose whether to sit, stand or lie down, before a firing squad of 10 carefully vetted policemen pull their triggers. Myuran Sukumaran is an Australian drug smuggler on death row in Kerobokan. He said recently: &quot;It&apos;s like having a gun pointing at the back of your head and you don&apos;t know when it will go off.&quot; But that remains just a possibility for now in the Dougall case. For the next three months the co-accused will live in the cells beneath Denpasar&apos;s police station, Polda Bali, as they are interrogated and police formulate the charges. In this process the police prize contrition, helpfulness, even friendliness, in a suspect. Ponder, Dougall and Beales have so far failed these tests with their defiance. By contrast, her decision to inform on her alleged co-conspirators has already bought Sandiford a significantly more sympathetic hearing from the police and judges. Proving that you are addicted to drugs can also help. If after the 90-day investigation is finished (or the cells get too crowded), the five will be moved to Kerobokan to await trial. There is no bail in Bali. Trials are conducted without juries and, compared to western countries, quickly. The &quot;Bali Nine&quot;, a group of young Australians, including Sukumaran, who were caught trying to export heroin out of Bali, were tried and sentenced less than a year after their arrests. There is scope for three appeals from that initial decision, which drags the process out. But judges can increase as well as decrease sentences on appeal. At one stage a number of the Bali Nine appealed against their life sentences only to see them changed to death, before seeing them reduced again on further appeal. After the final appeal, to Indonesia&apos;s Supreme Court, is exhausted, prisoners have one more chance, an application to the president for clemency. Two weeks ago, Corby became one of the rare drug convicts to win this lottery. The price was her sanity. The pretty young woman, who denies she is a cannabis smuggler, is now mentally ill. She won her five-year reduction on humanitarian grounds and is eligible for release in September 2017. The four middle-aged Britons in Bali&apos;s police cells should perhaps start getting used to each other&apos;s company.

The national manager, who had previously justified Ferdinand&apos;s omission citing &quot;footballing reasons&quot;, has called up the inexperienced Liverpool full-back Martin Kelly as a replacement for Cahill rather than the 33-year-old. The Manchester United defender, who has won 81 caps, made his frustration clear on Sunday by posting the message &quot;What reasons?????!!!&quot; on his Twitter account. It has been suggested his absence might owe more to the fact John Terry is due in court on 9\u00a0July accused of racially abusing Ferdinand&apos;s younger brother, Anton, during Chelsea&apos;s defeat at Queens Park Rangers last October. Terry denies the charge. Hodgson, while acknowledging the potentially unsettling nature of the off-the-pitch issues, has repeatedly stated the court case has never dictated his selection policy, though his insistence that Ferdinand had been omitted on the grounds of what he could provide on the field has now been left rather exposed. The centre-half proved his fitness over the season&apos;s final weeks and having already been away on holiday, has been training both in his personal gym at home and at United&apos;s Carrington complex. Indeed, he was fit enough to play in a charity game in Bangkok on 24 May on behalf of his club\u2011mate, Park Ji-sung. Ferdinand is now to go on a second holiday with his family to Paphos leaving it up to his representative, Jamie Moralee, to express his smoldering disappointment. &quot;Lampard, Terry, Barry, Gerrard all ageing but they go to the tournament,&quot; said Moralee. &quot;Why is Rio different? To treat a player that has captained and served his country 81 times [in this manner] is nothing short of disgraceful. [A] total lack of respect from Hodgson and the FA as far as I am concerned.&quot; Kelly made 12 Premier League starts last season and has 22 in his entire career, but he will travel to Poland on Wednesday as the sixth Liverpool player in the party, with two minutes of senior international experience behind him. The 22-year-old did at least train with the full squad in the buildup to making that brief debut in the friendly in Norway, with the national management confident of the full-back&apos;s current state of fitness, even if he has travelled to New York on holiday since the game in Oslo. He was summoned from that vacation on Sunday once x-rays on Cahill confirmed he had broken his jaw on both sides, having been shoved into the on-rushing Joe Hart by the Belgium forward Dries Mertens during the 1-0 victory at Wembley on Saturday. The 26-year-old has now returned to Chelsea for treatment. The Belgian player on Sunday night expressed regret for the blatant and unnecessary push in the centre-half&apos;s back that earned him a booking but has now cost Cahill the chance to feature at his first major finals. &quot;I sincerely apologise for the harm I&apos;ve caused to Cahill,&quot; he said. &quot;When in the heat of the moment, you often don&apos;t think about the consequences. My thoughts go out to him and I hope he recovers well.&quot; That will be little consolation for Cahill, a European Cup winner last month, with the circumstances of his injury provoking a dismayed reaction from his team\u2011mates. Joleon Lescott, who appears likeliest to partner Terry at the heart of England&apos;s defence in their opening Group\u00a0D match against France in Donetsk next Monday, claimed the foul was &quot;more reckless and dangerous than most two-footed tackles, so why only a yellow?&quot; The captain, Steven Gerrard, said he was &quot;angry&quot; at the loss of another key player. Terry underwent his own scan on a tight hamstring on Sunday and will be checked again , when the squad reconvene ahead of the flight to their base in Krakow, with Hodgson confident the 31-year-old will be fully fit to feature in the finals. While the former England captain had struck up an impressive partnership with Cahill for club and country, he and Lescott have started only two games together for England - both against Andorra in qualifying for the 2010 World Cup - but did play 51 minutes together against Belgium on Saturday before Terry felt tightness in his thigh. Regardless, Cahill has now been added to a lengthy list of enforced absentees that already included Gareth Barry, Frank Lampard, Michael Dawson, John Ruddy and Darren Bent, together with the youngsters Chris Smalling, Kyle Walker, Jack Wilshere and Jack Rodwell. The Manchester City defender Micah Richards, who can operate at right-back and centre\u2011half, might have been in contention for selection but his refusal to take up a place on Hodgson&apos;s standby list \u2013 he took offence that it was Stuart Pearce rather than the senior manager who contacted him to inform him of the decision \u2013 has effectively cost him a place in the travelling party. Phil Jones and Phil Jagielka are effectively now providing cover at centre-back. When asked specifically on Saturday night about the prospect of Ferdinand, who has not played for his country for a year, potentially returning to the fold, Hodgson had understandably declined to address the issue with the extent of Cahill&apos;s injury unclear at the time. &quot;But we have been unlucky, not least in the quality of players we have been losing,&quot; he said.", "publicationDate": "2012-06-03T19:29:22Z", "tags": ["England", "Roy Hodgson", "Rio Ferdinand", "Euro 2012", "Football", "Sport", "European Championship"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jun/03/euro-2012-cahill-england-rio-ferdinand", "title": "Euro 2012: Gary Cahill out of England squad but still no Rio Ferdinand", "sentences": ["Indeed, he was fit enough to play in a charity game in Bangkok on 24 May on behalf of his club\u2011mate, Park Ji-sung."]}, {"article": "Football reasons, Roy Hodgson had said. &quot;What reasons?????!!!&quot; Rio Ferdinand responded on Twitter, and it is fair to say\u00a0that keeping his finger pressed down on the question and exclamation marks made it clear what he made of Martin Kelly&apos;s callup and where it left his own England career. Finished, almost certainly. Ferdinand was probably never going to go quietly after finding out, once again, he had been overlooked, this time in favour of a promising yet raw 22-year-old who plays predominantly at right-back. A serial Premier League winner, with a 14-year international career encompassing 81 caps, had just learned of his place in the new order of merit and the anger was understandable when, put bluntly, there is nobody in the world who can convince him it is genuinely about football any longer. For Ferdinand it is simple. All the different strands, the clues, the reading between the lines, and what is now staring him in the face. It all comes back to one man: John Terry. The England manager has certainly left himself vulnerable to scrutiny and, in the process, it is easy to sympathise with Kelly, a talented player who has acquitted himself ably as Glen Johnson&apos;s understudy at Liverpool and can never have imagined that the initial exhilaration of being asked to join the squad, cutting short a holiday in New York, would be followed by the realisation that at least 95% of the country does not believe it is warranted. Gary Lineker&apos;s own contribution to Twitter was revealing in another way: &quot;Yet another injury blow. Gary Cahill out. Time for Rio Ferdinand? No. Micah Richards then? No. How remiss of me, has to be Martin Kelly.&quot; Lineker is hardly known for his sarcasm. The Richards situation should certainly not be overlooked amid all the rancour about Ferdinand and, again, it is not an episode that reflects particularly well on Hodgson. Contrary to popular opinion, Richards would have loved the chance to board the plane to Krakow on Wednesday. The first thing to consider, however, is that Cahill&apos;s absence, with a double fracture to the jaw, is a considerable setback given the understanding he has developed in defence alongside Terry and Ashley Cole and, most recently, a performance in the Champions League final that had a significant bearing on Chelsea overcoming Bayern Munich. Joleon Lescott has had a good season at Manchester City and the same applies to Phil Jagielka of Everton. All the same, Ferdinand is not demonstrating rampant big-headedness to believe he should be in the team, never mind just the squad. At 33, his fitness has been an issue for three seasons but he has not missed a game through injury since January, and Hodgson emphasised when he announced his squad that Ferdinand was being left out for football reasons rather than concerns about whether his body could hold up to tournament football. What he has never done is explain what those football reasons are. Ferdinand&apos;s mood is not soothed by the fact that Phil Jones, one of his understudies at Old Trafford, is in the squad and that Hodgson was also planning to select another Manchester United player, Chris Smalling, until prevented by injury. In fairness to Hodgson, the fact that Jones and Smalling can\u00a0also play at right-back was attractive to him but nobody will dissuade Ferdinand now from suspecting that Fabio Capello&apos;s successor may well have decided it would not be feasible to include him and Terry in\u00a0the same squad when the Chelsea player is to stand trial on 9\u00a0July for allegedly racially abusing Anton Ferdinand, Rio&apos;s younger brother. Terry denies the charge. What particularly appals Ferdinand is that this case has nothing to do with him and, in his mind, it should have been Terry who was left out if he was facing such a serious allegation. Even after the FA made it clear Terry could play, Ferdinand was willing to travel with the squad and engage in a working relationship. Whether that would have been possible, it is difficult to say, but it is easy to see why Hodgson would have had misgivings. He is aware, for starters, of Ferdinand&apos;s popularity within the squad and that several players all but blanked Terry before the games against Spain and Sweden last October. Lescott is understood to be firmly in the Ferdinand camp and will now partner Terry after apparently cold-shouldering him during previous get-togethers. The case of Richards is very different and would have been solved far more easily had Hodgson spoken to the Manchester City player. Instead, Hodgson asked the England Under-21 manager Stuart Pearce to contact Richards to break the news that he had not made the squad. That was the first mistake because, once Richards had taken in the initial disappointment, he was entitled to be put out that the manager had not contacted him personally but telephoned everyone else himself. His pride was bruised, as it often is with footballers, but it was still a situation that could have been resolved with little fuss. Perhaps it was that Hodgson felt Pearce, who knows Richards well, could handle it more sensitively. There could be any number of explanations, yet it was unusual in the extreme for a manager to delegate such an important call. Richards then had two conversations with Pearce. The first informed him he had not made the cut, which was a considerable blow given he was coming off the back of a title-winning season and Kyle Walker had already pulled out with injury. Pearce then arranged to phone back later to establish if Richards would go on the standby list. The background context here is that Richards had been almost permanently ignored by Capello, with one disappointment after another. Before the second conversation with Pearce, he spoke to his father, whose advice was to ask, politely, not to be considered \u2013 not in a fit of pique, but simply because he was so devastated. Hodgson sent Richards a short text message the following morning saying he was &quot;disappointed&quot; with the decision and has not been in touch since. In the end Richards arranged a last-minute holiday to Barbados with Daniel Sturridge \u2013 in part, to get over the disappointment of missing out. Ferdinand left on Sunday on a holiday of his own but before swapping rainy Manchester for the Greek sunshine, he was intrigued to find out the FA&apos;s reasoning is that Kelly has the advantage of being part of the squad since the Norway game, and that Hodgson was concerned calling up another player would mean bringing in someone who had not played since 13\u00a0May. Ferdinand has daily workouts at his home gymnasium, regularly goes into United&apos;s training ground and played in a charity match for Park Ji-sung in Bangkok on 24\u00a0May. Fitness should not have been an issue for Richards either, given that he is always among the players at City to have the lowest percentage of body fat when they are checked over out of season. He is back from Barbados now and said to be in a state of mild shock \u2013 not by his own omission, but Ferdinand&apos;s.", "publicationDate": "2012-06-03T21:59:00Z", "tags": ["England", "Roy Hodgson", "Rio Ferdinand", "Euro 2012", "Football", "Sport", "European Championship"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jun/03/england-euro-2012-rio-ferdinand", "title": "Euro 2012: Tough calls make a rod for England's bedraggled back-line | Daniel Taylor", "sentences": ["Ferdinand has daily workouts at his home gymnasium, regularly goes into United&apos;s training ground and played in a charity match for Park Ji-sung in Bangkok on 24\u00a0May."]}, {"article": "It has offices in 78 countries, is a model of corporate responsibility and is, arguably, more British than the royal family. Lloyd&apos;s Register (LR) could be a cheerleader for foreign secretary William Hague&apos;s exhortations &quot;to win our place in the world economy&quot; \u2013 except that chief executive, Richard Sadler, is strongly critical of Westminster policies. &quot;The government needs a long-term plan to protect the supply chain, whether we are talking about food or energy. If [shipping and oil capacity] is all in the hands of foreign governments we should not be surprised if they protect their own first if the need arrives,&quot; he argues. &quot;We are not looking ahead and taking an integrated approach like in China and Germany and that is poor policy. And if a government is not here to protect British society then what on earth is it here for?&quot; asks Sadler. The LR business is involved in the power production and maritime fields, so it is not surprising Sadler is interested in how to secure Britain&apos;s strategic interests through a kind of national shipping fleet or energy provider. LR, a &quot;classification society&quot; that assesses the mechanical safety and management systems of everything from ships to nuclear plants to food supply chains, does not rule out the concept of state-owned businesses needing to be established, though Sadler says other options need to be looked at first. &quot;There needs to be a national strategy in these areas. I am not talking necessarily about re-establishing commercial shipbuilding here but governments have been short-termist and we have to think how we need to support society in 2030 or 2050. How is the population going to keep warm and feed itself?&quot; LR is certainly patriotic. It boasts of being 100% British \u2013 in the sense it is located here and has no foreign ownership of any kind \u2013 but is actually busier in China than the City. Of its 8,500 staff only 1,500 of them are working throughout Britain with around 750 now in China. And there is little doubt it could happily wave goodbye to its City headquarters if it had to and still thrive. But LR is a very unusual beast to start with in that it is a not-for-profit organisation that ploughs all its excess cash back into its own operations or gives it to charity or academia. And it has no hesitation investing in new university-based technology centres, whether in Singapore or Southampton as well as handing out cash to run lifeboats through the RNLI. But there is little doubt where home is, given LR was a product of the same Lombard Street coffee shop as another famous maritime name, the Lloyd&apos;s insurance market. The two organisations were once one, and continue to provide services for each other but they have no ownership ties any more. LR is also at least 20 times smaller in revenue terms. The company employs fewer than 10,000 staff but has a turnover of nearly \u00a31bn and makes steady returns of 10% on that. About 40% of the revenues still come from roughly the same kind of maritime business that LR started in. It was formed in 1760 to provide third-party safety checks on the fleet of\u00a0merchant vessels that served the British empire from its base in London docks. But a current slump in shipping \u2013 following the 2008 credit crunch \u2013 and the growth of the energy sector has led to wind farms and oil refineries expanding to 30% of its business. So when EDF of France comes up with a new reactor design for Britain, it goes to Lloyd&apos;s Register. And yet the company is also active in the transport business helping certify the safety of a new metro links in Beijing and Bangkok as well as Dubai Many of its customers are governments or insurers but it has 50,000 current clients on the management systems side alone, mostly in the private business sector. One of the fastest growing sides of the business is assessing global food security so it provides advice to companies such as Coca-Cola, Cargill, and Mars. Some of LR&apos;s rivals such as Bureau Veritas, the French classification society, have floated on the stock market but Sadler says LR has no such plan \u2013 or need. But does it not miss the discipline that goes with having outside investors? &quot;Well, clearly you have to have a self-motivated CEO and management team. But we drive performance because we have a passion for what the organisation stands for and its history,&quot; he says. &quot;But just as Steve Jobs [of Apple] was passionate about not just what he made but how he made it, so are we in a different way. And we have a lot of success recruiting 25- to 35-years-olds who are fascinated by working for a company that is designed to add value to society and not just make a\u00a0profit.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-06-05T17:34:08Z", "tags": ["Insurance industry", "Economics", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Business", "Economic policy", "Politics", "UK news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/05/lloyds-register-art-staying-afloat", "title": "Lloyd's Register, and the art of staying afloat in troubled waters", "sentences": ["And yet the company is also active in the transport business helping certify the safety of a new metro links in Beijing and Bangkok as well as Dubai Many of its customers are governments or insurers but it has 50,000 current clients on the management systems side alone, mostly in the private business sector."]}, {"article": "The Rio+ 20 Earth summit could collapse after countries failed to agree on acceptable language just two weeks before 120 world leaders arrive at the biggest UN summit ever organised, WWF warned on Wednesday. An extra week given over to the UN&apos;s preparatory negotiations in New York fell into disarray over the weekend as talks aimed to bring countries together to set a new path for sustainable development splintered into 19 separate dialogues with major internal disagreements on the processes to be followed. &quot;We are facing two likely scenarios \u2013 an agreement so weak it is meaningless, or complete collapse. Neither of these options would give the world what it needs. Country positions are still too entrenched and too far apart to provide a meaningful draft agreement for approval by an expected 120 heads of state&quot;, said WWF director general Jim Leape. Countries are not being asked by the UN to legally commit themselves to anything, but only to sign up to an aspirational &quot;roadmap&quot; contained in a document called &quot;the future we want&quot; and to a commitment to the so-called &apos;green economy&apos; of jobs generated from industries such as renewable energy and energy efficiency. It is hoped that they will also agree to introduce by 2015 a set of sustainable development goals (SDGs) similar in ambition to the millennium development goals which covered areas like HIV reduction and clean water provision. The SDGs could cover areas such as energy, water and food. However, in a repeat of battles played out in global climate and trade talks, they have fought bitterly over every comma and phrase in the prepartory meetings and in particular are still deeply divided over the definition and scope of the phrase &quot;green economy&quot;. They are now expected to take several years to identify, formulate and agree on the goals. According to both WWF and Malaysia-based NGO Third World Network, the most recent draft text put forward in New York was a &quot;significant weakening&quot; of previous drafts, particularly in the areas of valuing natural wealth and ocean protection. The best that is now likely to come from Rio is a process aimed to achieve agreement over many years, and a series of eye-catching initiatives proposed by individual countries, UN bodies and large businesses often working together. These include actions to make transport more sustainable, reduce hunger, improve the health of oceans, and to provide electricity for everyone in the world. Definition of the concept and principles guiding the &quot;green economy&quot; have proved the hardest to reach because what is decided at Rio could favour or limit the development of some countries. The EU and other rich countries want all countries to agree to remodel their economies to manage resources more efficiently, develop renewable and low carbon energy, and reduce pollution. But G77 countries have argued that while the goal is acceptable, they risk being at a competitive disadvantage in the race for future global markets and are suspicious that the green economy is a pretense for rich countries to erect &quot;green&quot; trade barriers on developing country exports. They further argue that if they are to sign up to the &quot;green economy&quot;, there should be commitments by rich countries to new finance and technology transfer agreements \u2013 something so far unacceptable to the US and EU. Many environment and development NGOs are also fearful of the green economy proposals, which they believe will encourage countries to put monetary value on all nature, reducing forest and ocean protection to markets and profits and undermining principles of ecological justice and collective wellbeing. &quot;Instead of putting a price on nature we must recognise that Nature is not a thing or mere supplier of resources. What we need is to forge a new system of development based on the principles of collective wellbeing, social and environmental justice and the satisfaction of the basic necessities of all&quot;, said Pablo Solon, former Bolivian ambassador to the UN and now director of Bangkok-based NGO Focus on the Global South . &quot;We cannot keep promoting such destructive model of development that does not acknowledge the planetary limits of economic growth&quot;, he said. Divisions between the countries are now thought to be as deep as any seen in the long-running and separate climate negotiations. Many developing countries are said to be distraught that the US is consistently trying to bury the principles guiding sustainable development agreed after fierce struggles at the Rio earth summit in 1992 and its follow-up meeting in Johannesburg in 2002. &quot;We are in real danger of going backwards. [The US] wants to reject principles including national sovereignty, the right to development, common but differentiated responsibilities and the obligation not to cause environmental harm&quot;, said one observer. Despite the differences, UN leaders remained upbeat. &quot;I sense a real dialogue \u2013 a real willingness to find common ground,&quot; said Rio+20 Secretary-General Sha Zukang. &quot;This spirit is encouraging, and we must carry it to Rio.&quot; Kim Sook, ambassador of the Republic of Korea and co-chair of the preparatory committee said that before the negotiations, only 6% of the text had been agreed upon. Now, that number has jumped to more than 20%, with many additional paragraphs &quot;close to agreement&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2012-06-06T13:10:41Z", "tags": ["Rio+20 Earth summit", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Global climate talks", "Global development", "Environmental sustainability", "Sustainable development", "Environment", "World news", "WWF", "Green politics", "Sustainable development goals"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/06/rio-earth-summit-wwf", "title": "Rio+ 20 Earth summit could collapse, WWF warns", "sentences": ["What we need is to forge a new system of development based on the principles of collective wellbeing, social and environmental justice and the satisfaction of the basic necessities of all&quot;, said Pablo Solon, former Bolivian ambassador to the UN and now director of Bangkok-based NGO Focus on the Global South ."]}, {"article": " Preamble We&apos;ve seen some preposterous concepts over the years. Deep-fried Mars bars. Grilling Monster Munch on the George Foreman (other people do that, right?). Shoreditch. This haircut. Text commentaries of live sport. And now, most absurd of all, it appears that play is going to start on time at Edgbaston this morning. I know. This is mainly thanks to some heroic work from the groundstaff; most of them haven&apos;t been home for the last two nights. There will be 98 overs in the day \u2013 the apocalypse notwithstanding \u2013 and play can go on until 7pm. It&apos;s tempting to suggest there&apos;s no way we can get a result in this shortened match, but plenty of modern Tests end in three days (one, between these sides in 2000, ended in two), and there is a sweaty pitch to work with here. At approximately 10.31am, either Andrew Strauss or Darren Sammy will be uttering the phrase &quot;We&apos;ll have a bowl&quot;. It&apos;s not quite Johannesburg 1999, when England were 2 for 4 on a wet one before they knew what day it was, but this should be a seriously good toss to win. Both sides must be tempted to go in with four seamers. Jimmy Anderson could have a field d-oh.  England have won the toss, and you don&apos;t need me to tell you that they will bowl first. Although I just have, so deal with it. There&apos;s some pr-etty interesting team news. England have omitted Stuart Broad, who according to that Twitter thing wasn&apos;t entirely enamoured with the decision. He, like Jimmy Anderson, is probably thinking of the ten-for that got away. For whatever it&apos;s worth (clue: bugger all) I think it&apos;s the right decision to leave them out. West Indies make four changes. Shivnarine Chanderpaul is out with a side strain, so Assad Fudadin makes his Test debut. There&apos;s also a debut for the mystery spinner who the Prodigy were talking about 15 years ago. Tino Best is in as well \u2013 let&apos;s get the obligatory &apos;mind the windows&apos; link out the way \u2013 and so is Narsingh Deonarine. The walking wicket, Kirk Edwards, and Shane Shillingford are omitted. England Strauss (c), Cook, Trott, Pietersen, Bell, Bairstow, Prior (wk), Bresnan, Swann, Finn, Onions. West Indies Barath, Powell, Fudadin, Darren Bravo, Deonarine, Samuels, Ramdin (wk), Sammy (c), Best, Rampaul, Narine.  So who takes the new ball? I&apos;d imagine Finn and maybe Bresnan, on seniority, although it must be really tempting to give it to Onions on this pitch. I can&apos;t wait to see him bowl. The last time we saw him in Test cricket was as a matchsaving batsman in South Africa in 2009-10.  1st over: West Indies 3-0 (Barath 0, Powell 2) It&apos;s more than a little brisk at Edgbaston; &quot;a really unpleasant day for cricket&quot; says Mike Atherton on Sky. It will be Graham Onions to take the first over, in fact, for the first time in his Test career. He destroyed West Indies on his Test debut three years ago, and is bang in form: he has 38 wickets at an average of 11.71 in first-class cricket this season. On Sky, Michael Holding says Onions&apos; run up is &quot;very attractive to watch ... very rhythmical&quot;. Coming from Whispering Death, that&apos;s quite a compliment. Three runs from a quiet first over.  2nd over: West Indies 7-0 (Barath 4, Powell 2) Steven Finn will have to wait a little longer, because Tim Bresnan is going to share the new ball. I really wouldn&apos;t fancy facing Finn today; he&apos;s going to be feral by the time he gets into the attack. Finn took the new ball ahead of Bresnan the last time they played together, in Sri Lanka in April, but I suppose England want to give it to their biggest swing bowlers. Bresnan, striving for swing, is driven handsomely through the covers for four by Barath.  3rd over: West Indies 10-0 (Barath 4, Powell 5) Powell drives Onions crisply down the ground for three, and then Onions zips a good one past Barath&apos;s defensive poke. It&apos;s been a fairly quiet start. England were two for four by this stage in that Johannesburg match 13 years ago. &quot;At Edgbaston today and wondering whether I can prevail upon the readership for a charitable cause,&quot; Says Michael Jelley. &quot;My friend Glenn and I are cycling Arch to Arc next month in aid of Parkinson&apos;s \u2013 London to Paris in 24 hours. I&apos;m a 19 stone weakling and Glenn gets lost in his own bathroom so any help would be massively appreciated...&quot;  4th over: West Indies 14-0 (Barath 4, Powell 9) Powell, attempting to drive, is beaten on the inside by a full delivery from Bresnan that moves sharply off the seam. He times the next ball through mid off for four and then survives a big but lone shout for caught behind by Bresnan. Hotspot confirms there was no edge. An eventful over concludes when Powell, driving with no feet movement again, is beaten on the inside for the second time. &quot;Up here in Scotland we have a robust attitude to cricket in adverse weather conditions,&quot; says Alex Hayes. Well, he said it on Thursday, but I haven&apos;t got any fresh emails so I&apos;m going to publish it. &quot;During last week&apos;s enthralling encounter between Doune and Gargunnock in the West Stirlingshire League, almost the whole of Gargunnock&apos;s innings was played in heavy rain. The only comment I heard on the conditions was that it was nice to have the rain to freshen up a rather muggy evening, and to keep the midges at bay a bit. It&apos;s just a question of shortening the run-up and pitching it up a bit isn&apos;t it?&quot;  5th over: West Indies 15-0 (Barath 5, Powell 9) Barath leaves a delivery from Onions that bounces just over middle and leg stump. I think he might have left it on line, which is madness against a wicket-to-wicket bowler like Onions. And now Barath is dropped! He pushed at a length delivery that seamed away to take the edge, and Ian Bell dropped a routine shin-high chance at third slip. Oh, Ian. He&apos;s only in the slips because of Anderson&apos;s absence, of course. Rotation out!  6th over: West Indies 15-0 (Barath 5, Powell 9) A maiden from Bresnan to Powell.  7th over: West Indies 15-0 (Barath 5, Powell 9) An inside edge probably saves Powell from being LBW to Onions, who is settling into a nice rhythm. It feels like Onions is a relative youngster, although he turns 30 in September. That&apos;s a maiden to Powell, so Onions&apos; figures are 4-1-6-0. &quot;Morning Smyth, morning everybody,&quot; says Josh Robinson. &quot;On TMS, Agnew has just referred to John Morris as a famous Sopwith Camel pilot. I&apos;m convinced, however, that his escapade with Gower at the Gabba in 1988 involved a Tiger Month. However, it&apos;s not something I can find on Statsguru. Is my memory failing me? Or is Agnew just past it?&quot; It was indeed a Tiger Moth, although it was 1991 rather than 1988. So you&apos;re both correct and senile.  8th over: West Indies 15-0 (Barath 5, Powell 9) A maiden from Bresnan. We&apos;ve only had one run in the last four overs, and that was from the dropped catch. &quot;I really thought that the days of &apos;Buggins Turn&apos; in the England slip cordon were gone,&quot; harrumphs Richard O&apos;Hagan. &quot;There&apos;s no reason to have Bell there when Trott is in the side, there really isn&apos;t. I know the old &apos;sweaty hands&apos; argument, but how often does third slip need to touch the ball, for Jimmy&apos;s sake?&quot; It&apos;s a bit odd, in that Trott fields there for Warwickshire but Bell doesn&apos;t. Bell is such a brilliant short leg\u00a0\u2013 arguably peerless \u2013 so maybe they wanted to see if that would translate to the slip cordon. That would be fair enough.  9th over: West Indies 15-0 (Barath 5, Powell 9) Andrew Strauss takes the muzzle off Steven Finn. There&apos;s a bit of carry in this pitch, which means Powell is able to leave a straight delivery that bounces over the stumps. A good first over is a maiden.  &quot;Morning Smyth,&quot; says Joe Minihane. &quot;Once again I&apos;m checking in to the OBO from my six month trip around Asia, this time in Bangkok. I should be out drinking Chang or making like Michael in Alan Partridge, but instead am loyally hitting F5 while it hoses it down outside. Shameful, I know, but few things excite me like a three-day dead rubber.&quot; You and me both, capitan, you and me both.  REVIEW!: West Indies 19-0 (Barath not out 5) Onions switches ends and has a huge shout for LBW against Barath, who got in a rare mess as he pushed around his front pad at a straight delivery. Height is the issue. The umpire Tony Hill thought about for it ages before saying not out; so did Andrew Strauss before reluctantly deciding to review. I reckon this will be &apos;umpire&apos;s call&apos;. Indeed it is: the ball was just hitting the top of the leg bail, so Barath survives and England lose a review.  10th over: West Indies 21-0 (Barath 7, Powell 9) &quot;After all the work that&apos;s gone into the Test team of recent years I think it&apos;s too much of a risk to play Bresnan in this match,&quot; says PJ Connolly. &quot;That glorious record of his is surely going to be coming to an end in this match. Do the selectors know if he is equipped to mentally cope with not actually winning a Test match? Nobody knows the repercussions such a blow as a drawn match might have on him. He might not even know it&apos;s a draw at the end and he&apos;ll be running around pulling the stumps out and wildly celebrating another Test match won, another series whitewash.&quot;  11th over: West Indies 25-0 (Barath 7, Powell 12) Finn has disturbed the stumps four or five times in two overs during his bowling action, which shows how close to the stumps he is getting. Powell drives nicely for three and then Barath wears a meaningful short ball in the stomach.  &quot;Thanks to your link to Flintoff&apos;s Sash Window concern \u2013 which I don&apos;t think is particularly funny \u2013 I have spent the best part of an hour trawling through YouTube and watching many many videos and clips of sledging,&quot; says Neil Mackie. &quot;And after all that, there is only one sledging video that I will watch for as long as YouTube exists, and that is Mitchell Johnson and Good Jimmy Anderson. It has no relevance to the day&apos;s play, but it is marvellous.&quot; As enjoyable as that was, it did lose a fair bit of its appeal when Johnson destroyed England the next day.  12th over: West Indies 28-0 (Barath 7, Powell 15) Powell, wafting around a full inducker, survives another huge LBW shout from Onions. But for a pesky inside edge he would have been plumb. Powell waves a short ball to third man for three later in the over.  &quot;Seems that slow outfields have gone the same way as muddy football pitches,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;I suppose that&apos;s fair enough, but I kinda miss them.&quot; I&apos;m sure I read a book recently that had a small section on muddy pitches. It was a life-changing book; a real epiphany-inducer. I wish I could remember what it was called.  13th over: West Indies 30-0 (Barath 8, Powell 16) Powell is beaten four times in an excellent over from Finn. The third of those was a beastly lifter. There have been a few close shaves, as you&apos;d expect, but the two young openers have done pretty well in tricky conditions. Barath has been especially judicious. &quot;I live in Italy,&quot; one-nils Ben Carson. &quot;Cricket is still almost unknown here as a sport. So I&apos;ve taken to telling everyone that match fixing happens regularly in cricket in the hope that maybe they&apos;ll all get interested.&quot;  14th over: West Indies 31-0 (Barath 9, Powell 16) Barath is batting like Blair Pocock. He has nine from 48 balls. &quot;Hi again Rob From sunny sunny Naxos,&quot; says Andy Underwood. &quot;Another food/kitchen appliance staple you may consider adding to your repertoire is the pork pie and dairylea Brevilled sandwich discovered by yours truly during the 1982 World Cup. I like to think of it as early Plymouth tapas.&quot; There&apos;s a few  people  things I&apos;d like to put under the Breville, but pork pie is not one of them. What is the most unusual thing you have eaten? Tell me. I&apos;m a vanilla foodie and can&apos;t think of anything especially unusual, apart from maybe Bovril crisps as a kid. Hardcore maverick stuff, I know. You only get one life after all.  15th over: West Indies 36-0 (Barath 14, Powell 16) That was nearly the first wicket. Barath, driven back by a fine bouncer, was caught on the crease and inside-edged a good delivery just wide of the diving Matt Prior and away for four. The next ball is a seaming short ball that beats the edge. This is good stuff from Finn, who looks mean and moody.&quot;Finn&apos;s disease is \u2013 ahem \u2013 catching-,&quot; says Richard O&apos;Hagan. &quot;I&apos;ve just walked too close to the fridge and knocked the shopping list off it. I fear for the safety of the kitchen clock that, eighteen months on, I&apos;ve not yet got around to fixing to the wall.&quot; Life&apos;s what happens to you while you&apos;re busy walking into the fridge and making other plans.  16th over: West Indies 41-0 (Barath 15, Powell 20) Five from Onions&apos; eighth over. He&apos;s probably due a rest now. There has been talk of a bowl-off between Finn and Onions. I&apos;m not really sure that&apos;s the case, although it does bring to mind other bat-offs and bowl-offs. The obvious one was at The Oval in 1998, when there was one batting place left in the Ashes tour party for either Graeme Hick or John Crawley. Hick scored 107 on the first day \u2013 and then Crawley trumped up with 156 on the second.  &quot;While I agree a result in three days is eminently possible \u2013 especially without Chanderpaul batting \u2013 if the game&apos;s meandering towards a draw do you think there&apos;s any chance of the captains creating an artificial chase?&quot; says Lee Rodwell. &quot;Or has Hansie Cronje obliterated that option from Test cricket permanently?&quot; Kind of. Mind you I&apos;m not sure he obliterated the option, as it was never really an acceptable option in the first place.  17th over: West Indies 45-0 (Barath 19, Powell 20) Finn is giving Barath a bit of a working over. There&apos;s a muted appeal for LBW when a shortish delivery strikes the jumping Barath on the pad. When he follows that with a fuller delivery, Barath drives classily through mid off for four. That&apos;s an excellent response. &quot;I once experimented and made a three egg omelette with a filling of tinned pilchards,&quot; says Arthur Seeley. &quot;It was disgusting. I was hungry and all that I had available. I finished up eating dry bread.&quot; I suspect even eating fresh air would have been preferable.  WICKET! West Indies 49-1 (Powell c Swann b Bresnan 24) Tim Bresnan strikes with the third ball of a new spell. Powell felt for a delivery angled across him \u2013 he probably didn&apos;t need to play \u2013 and Graeme Swann at second slip just about held on to a sharp chance to his right. It almost popped out, but he managed to jam it against his not inconsiderable chin before clutching it in the ends of his fingers as he landed on those beautiful knees and toppled forward. At that stage the camera cut back to Bresnan, who was just about to put The Face on when he realised Swann had held on to the catch.  18th over: West Indies 51-1 (Barath 19, Fudaddin 2) The left-handed Assad Fudaddin comes out for his maiden Test innings. He gets off the mark with a work to leg.  19th over: West Indies 51-1 (Barath 19, Fudaddin 2) Barath defends watchfully against Finn. A maiden. &quot;When I started to study aesthetics as an undergrad, I encountered Immanuel Kant&apos;s idea that in order for something to be beautiful it can&apos;t be in the slightest bit agreeable,&quot; says Josh Robinson. &quot;So I tried to think of foods that could match that description. Liver and lychee certainly gets pretty close.&quot;  20th over: West Indies 51-1 (Barath 19, Fudaddin 2) Fudaddin has a modest first-class record, although he had an excellent domestic season. He gets in a bit of trouble with a short ball from Bresnan that follows him and takes a thick bottom edge from an attempted cut. Another maiden. &quot;May I recommend a toasted Spam (not the turkey one although the Spam with bacon works well), onion relish and cheese sandwich?&quot; says Phil Withall. &quot;Best served with a robust Merlot or a strong cup of tea.&quot; Or a robust cup of Merlot. A very, very big cup.  21st over: West Indies 56-1 (Barath 20, Fudaddin 6) Finn gets his first bowl at Fudaddin, who drives him confidently through extra cover for four. &quot;Eight of the England players from the team that beat the West Indies at Lord&apos;s in 2009 are in the team today,&quot; says Mike Jakeman. &quot;Only one (Ramdin) from the Windies. Makes a bit of a change from the 90s, doesn&apos;t it?&quot; Doesn&apos;t it just. I wonder how different the 1990s would have been if England had stuck with the young team they took to the Caribbean in 1993-94.  22nd over: West Indies 62-1 (Barath 26, Fudaddin 6) Graeme Swann is coming on for Tim Bresnan, who will presumably switch ends to give Finn a break after his seven-over spell. It&apos;s not a bad idea, especially with a debutant left-hander at the crease. For now it&apos;s the right-handed Barath to face, with a slip and short leg. There&apos;s a bit of turn and a biggish LBW shout; Barath was outside the line of off stump. After a couple of sighters, Barath gets down on one knee to mow Swann vigorously over long on for six. &quot;Have some of that&quot; says Bumble on Sky.  23rd over: West Indies 66-1 (Barath 27, Fudaddin 9) Finn gets an eighth over, in fact, and Fudaddin works him off the body for a couple. He has started solidly. &quot;Pilchard omelettes to one side, which is where they ended up,&quot; says Arthur Seeley. &quot;How is it we instinctively know certain things are not going to work. We never dream of making smokey bacon ice cream, or cheese and onion flavoured yoghurt. Neither do we dream of making strawberry flavoured crisps. Or do we?&quot; No.  24th over: West Indies 69-1 (Barath 30, Fudaddin 9) Barath square drives Swann for three, which gives Swann three deliveries at the left-handed Fudaddin. He defends carefully.  25th over: West Indies 75-1 (Barath 31, Fudaddin 14) Bresnan comes on now for Finn, who bowled a decent spell of 8-2-24-0. Fudaddin is turned round by a good delivery and edges low through the slips for four. Ten minutes to lunch. &quot;There is no &apos;unusual food&apos;, only unusual food combinations [as several of your OBO&apos;ers have demonstrated],&quot; says Sarah Bacon. &quot;A favourite toastie combo of mine, for example, is vintage cheddar and creamed corn. On its own, the cheese attracts universal approval; the creamed corn, universal opprobrium. But it&apos;s really good. Promise.&quot; Oof. Maybe we should knock this odd food thing on the head. I&apos;m starting to feel like Spud in Trainspotting when he leered at that fried breakfast.  26th over: West Indies 75-1 (Barath 31, Fudaddin 14) Fudaddin looks compact and organised at the crease. One flowing drive off Swann is well stopped at short extra cover. That aside he is content to defend, so it&apos;s a maiden.  27th over: West Indies 77-1 (Barath 33, Fudaddin 14) &quot;I&apos;d love to have arms and shoulders like Nadal,&quot; says my metrosexuality&apos;s Ian McCourt across the office. It&apos;s all pretty quiet at the cricket. West Indies seem content to play for lunch. They&apos;ve had a very good morning, Barath in particular.  28th over: West Indies 81-1 (Barath 36, Fudaddin 15) Barath late cuts Swann wide of slip for two. I think it&apos;s Strauss who has replaced Anderson at slip to the spinner.  29th over: West Indies 85-1 (Barath 40, Fudaddin 15) Barath edges Bresnan along the ground for four to end a good morning for the West Indies and a bad one for positive-result junkies around the world. See you in half an hour for the afternoon session.  LUNCH  30th over: West Indies 85-1 (Barath 40, Fudaddin 15) This is a pretty important session in the context of the match. If the West Indies are only one or two down at tea, we can probably kiss any chance of a result goodbye. Graham Onions starts after lunch and beats the debutant Assad Fudaddin with his first and third deliveries, the latter a marvellous delivery that roars away off the seam. A maiden to start the session. In other news, here&apos;s Stuart Broad on Twitter: &quot;I have a small virus but fully fine to play. Its a good opportunity to give Finny and Bunny some Test cricket in a shortened game.&quot; You don&apos;t need Babelfish to translate that one.  31st over: West Indies 90-1 (Barath 41, Fudaddin 19) Ian Bell has dropped another chance. This was even easier than the one in the morning session. Barath couldn&apos;t get on top of a superb short ball from Finn and fenced it towards the crouching Bell at third slip. It went straight through his hands. That&apos;s a minor shocker. Rotation out! Fudaddin riffs on Finn&apos;s pain by playing and missing and then slashing a square drive for four. Finn rams a short ball into Fudaddin&apos;s thigh and mouths a few sour somethings.  &quot;What with all the lost time, should the game today not have started at 1am, under floodlights, with sleeping bags provided for all,&quot; says Ian Copestake. &quot;Progressive thinking is what we need these days. Helicopter, blue-sky thinking.&quot; It ticks my box. But what would the goals, going forward, and what envelopes are we pushing? WE NEED TO PUSH ENVELOPES.  WICKET! West Indies 90-2 (Barath LBW b Onions 41) Graham Onions has his first Test wicket since January 2010. Possibly. Barath is going to review the decision. He played around his front pad at a fullish delivery bowled from slightly wider on the crease. That might have been sliding down the leg side. Here comes the replay. No, Hawkeye shows it was &gt; skimming the leg stump, so Barath is on his way for a disciplined 41. He might feel a little unfortunate as that was barely touching the leg stump. Mikey Holding is not impressed with that decision.  32nd over: West Indies 90-2 (Fudaddin 19, Darren Bravo 0) That was the last ball of the over.  33rd over: West Indies 90-2 (Fudaddin 19, Darren Bravo 0) Finn is hitting the stumps during his action, at least once in every over. He beats Fudaddin with a cracking full-length delivery that moves away off the seam. It&apos;s another maiden.  34th over: West Indies 92-2 (Fudaddin 20, Darren Bravo 1) In other news, here&apos;s an interesting piece on Comment is free about the Windies&apos; decline.  35th over: West Indies 92-2 (Fudaddin 20, Darren Bravo 1) Finn beats Fudaddin with consecutive deliveries to end another maiden. He is bowling with menace and purpose. Facing him really can&apos;t be much fun.  36th over: West Indies 96-2 (Fudaddin 20, Darren Bravo 5) After just two runs in five overs, Bravo releases some pressure with a wristy flick to fine leg for four off Onions.  37th over: West Indies 96-2 (Fudaddin 20, Darren Bravo 5)Another maiden from Finn, his third in a row. Not much is happening, so here&apos;s a tweet from Mike Selvey: &quot;Big sawdust piles at each end. Fast bowlers have special donor cards to leave the contents of their heads for that purpose. Groundstaff at Lord&apos;s once left a porn mag in the sawdust pile for WW Daniel.&quot;  38th over: West Indies 99-2 (Fudaddin 22, Darren Bravo 6) &quot;Re Stuart Broad on Twitter. Finny and Bunny?!&quot; says McMahon. &quot;hey sound like a Trevor and Simon/Sam and Mark (delete as appropriate depending on age) kids show double act. Makes you long for Beefy and Lamby.&quot; Thanks for that. I&apos;d expunged Trevor and Simon from my memory. Some of their characters were seriously sinister; kids TV as directed by David Lynch.  WICKET! West Indies 99-3 (Bravo ct and b Finn 6) Finn beats the driving Bravo with another gorgeous full-length delivery that lifts sharply enough for Prior to take it above his head. Those are monstrous deliveries, the sort Jason Gillespie used to bowl. Two balls later, he does pick up the wicket \u2013 and after all those jaffas, it was a nothing delivery that did the job. Bravo&apos;s wrists were a bit too stiff and he pushed the ball back whence it came for Finn to take a comfortable catch in his follow through.  39th over: West Indies 99-3 (Fudaddin 22, Samuels 0) Marlon Samuels has moved up to No5 in the absence of Shivnarire Chanderpaul, and he digs out an excellent yorker first ball. That&apos;s a wicket maiden from Finn, his fourth maiden in a row. &quot;According to TMS, Onions looks like &apos;a tall whippet&apos; which must make Bresnan a chunky Airedale and Finn an Irish Wolfhound,&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;Therefore Swann (if not a swan) is probably a Golden Retriever.&quot; So what&apos;s an elf?  40th over: West Indies 103-3 (Fudaddin 26, Samuels 0) Swann replaces Onions. His second ball is a rare piece of filth that Fudaddin carts through midwicket for four.  41st over: West Indies 106-3 (Fudaddin 26, Samuels 3) Samuels gets off the mark by pinging a full delivery from Finn through square leg for three. &quot;I have been informed that someone just searched for me on google,&quot; says Ian Copestake. &quot;Could you tell Mac Millings to stop it and especially to stop using the keywords &apos;Ian Crapstick&apos;.&quot;  42nd over: West Indies 106-3 (Fudaddin 26, Samuels 3) A maiden from Swann to Strauss. &quot;My Dear,&quot; says Dr Peter Robert. &quot;How are you doing? I know that this will surely be a pleasant surprise for you because you were not expecting it. I have instructed my Lawyer Barr Kwesi Asso to release $1,500,000.00 to you for your compensation for your assistant in the past which later failed.&quot; Brilliant. Not only am I $1,500,000.00 richer, I&apos;m living in an Agatha Christie novel.  43rd over: West Indies 108-3 (Fudaddin 27, Samuels 4) Bresnan replaces Finn. Nothing happens. Here&apos;s a story to enliven a somnolent afternoon. Never mind being the greatest sprinter ever, ever: Usain Bolt could soon be a professional cricketer in Australia. Here&apos;s Bolt bowling Chris Gayle in a charity match a few years ago.  44th over: West Indies 109-3 (Fudaddin 27, Samuels 4) It looks like Swann is trying to trap Fudaddin LBW on the inside, because he does sometimes plant his front foot. Nothing doing in that over. &quot;&apos;My Dear&apos;. Do you think Dr Peter Robert might have meant to send his email to Henry Blofeld?&quot; says Dr Josh Robinson.  45th over: West Indies 109-3 (Fudaddin 27, Samuels 4) Re: that email in the 42nd over, I do wish society still had a place for phrases like &apos;I know that this will surely be a pleasant surprise for you because you were not expecting it&apos;.&quot; The world seemed so much better back then, in the Agatha Christie novels. Yes there were murders, but forget those distractions. Besides, I bet they were all polite, refined murders. None of this grubby, newfangled flesh-eating nonsense.  46th over: West Indies 109-3 (Fudaddin 27, Samuels 4) SMIYTYHTOB, but that&apos;s a maiden from Swann to Fudaddin. It&apos;s been slow going since lunch, with 24 runs in 17 overs. Test cricket from the school of old. &quot;There&apos;s someone called &apos;Bunny&apos; on the England side?&quot; says Ian Copestake. &quot;Does she have green toenails and is their a cash machine nearby?&quot; Nobody uses cash anymore.  47th over: West Indies 110-3 (Fudaddin 27, Samuels 5) Once upon a time, all Test cricket was like this. &quot;Afternoon all,&quot; says Ben Carson, making the old OBO schoolboy error of assuming more than one reader. &quot;On the subject of Chris Gayle, here&apos;s the big man himself against Australia. One of his sixes makes it out of the stadium into the road.&quot;  48th over: West Indies 115-3 (Fudaddin 27, Samuels 10) Samuels moves smoothly back into his crease to drive Swann square on the off side for four. He looks as comfortable you would expect of a man in the form of his life. Fudaddin looks secure but a little strokeless. He has 27 from 101 balls and eight from his last 58 balls. &quot;Not only do I insist on using cash, I do not own a mobile phone,&quot; says Ian Copestake. &quot;Is there a group of like-minded dinasaurs I can join (apart from this one)?&quot; Good one. Next you&apos;ll be telling me you&apos;re not on Twitter!!!  49th over: West Indies 116-3 (Fudaddin 27, Samuels 11) Samuels drives Bresnan for a single. Yeah, yeah, I know that&apos;s not exactly a Pulitzer-winning entry, but you try sexing it up.  50th over: West Indies 117-3 (Fudaddin 27, Samuels 12) Fudaddin continues to defend against Swann. He hasn&apos;t scored from his last 28 deliveries. That&apos;s a dangerous game to play. &quot;But wouldn&apos;t you prefer to live in a Murder She Wrote TV series rather than an Agatha Christie novel?&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;In the heyday of cricket they might have preferred to inhabit Sherlock Holmes stories, except that rugby (and fishing) was always Dr Watson&apos;s passion. You couldn&apos;t imagine being in a Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammet story, maybe, but these days you might aspire to an Ian Rankin, Chris Brookmyre or Camilla Lackberg tale if you tended towards the sordid domestic genre in your middle years.&quot;  51st over: West Indies 123-3 (Fudaddin 27, Samuels 18) Batting is the easiest game in the world for Marlon Samuels right now. He moves across his stumps to drive Bresnan perfectly straight for four. That was delightful.  &quot;The ramshackle London-based Unavoidables cricket team are playing a 2-day 2-innings match in London next weekend (16th and 17th) but are badly short of players,&quot; says Tom Bowtell. &quot;If anyone fancies the chance to build an 154-ball 27 or finish with bowling figures of 34-19-49-3 they should email unavoidablescc@gmail.com.&quot;  52nd over: West Indies 128-3 (Fudaddin 28, Samuels 22) Fudaddin drives Swann for a single to move out of the nervous 27s, where he had been stuck for almost ten overs, and then Samuels crunches a drive through extra cover for four. He is batting with formidable authority. &quot;Sorry, only just catching up,&quot; says Mike Selvey. &quot;So some matters arising: 1. I can tell you that the pitch at Wanderers on which England were 2 for four was bone dry on the evening before because CMJ and I managed to see it before we were approached by a security guard and a very large dog on a lead and encouraged to leave. So subterfuge there.2. One delicious irony of the Tiger Moth escapade on the Gold Coast was that Gower and Morris borrowed the money for the flight from the team manager.3. Things we miss in cricket: bats with the dirty &apos;V&apos; on the reverse where it was used to whack down the divots on uncovered pitches4. I had a trio of crocodile, snake and camel at the Sheraton, Ayers Rock on night5. Whelk gratin was never a great success6. Usain Bolt would be faster than I ever was if he never bothered to let go of the ball and just ran to the other end. That&apos;s it.&quot;  WICKET! West Indies 128-4 (Fudaddin c Bell b Bresnan 28) Tim Bresnan has bounced Assad Fudaddin out. That was superb bowling. He pushed Fudaddin back with a couple of short balls and followed up with a third that Fudaddin couldn&apos;t really avoid on line or length. It looped up off the glove to third slip, where Ian Bell took the easiest of catches. Bresnan has bounced left-handers out before \u2013 most notably Raina and Yuvraj at Trent Bridge last year \u2013 and that was another really impressive bit of bullying. Fudaddin started well enough for a man on debut, but at some point after lunch he forgot about scoring runs. When you do that, there is usually one result.  53rd over: West Indies 129-4 (Samuels 22, Deonarine 1) Bresnan&apos;s figures are 15-4-37-2. He&apos;s useful.  54th over: West Indies 129-4 (Samuels 22, Deonarine 1) &quot;You&apos;re right about Marlon Samuels, who is batting sensationally,&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;What&apos;s noticeable is the time he has to play each shot\u00a0\u2013 a function of playing the ball directly below his eyes. Is seeing a talent eventually fulfilled as pleasing as seeing a talent arrive? Maybe more.&quot; Yes I would say more, although when a talent has let you down (for want of a better phrase) for so long, can you ever truly trust that talent? As thrilling as Samuels has been, there&apos;s no guarantee this will continue for the next few years. (Even though there is precedent, most obviously with Carl Hooper.)  55th over: West Indies 136-4 (Samuels 29, Deonarine 1) Samuels is on for another century here. He is playing absurdly well and has just eased another beautiful cover drive for four off Bresnan.  56th over: West Indies 141-4 (Samuels 34, Deonarine 1) Samuels waves Swann back over his head for four without a care in the world. This is the most prolific series of his international career.  57th over: West Indies 146-4 (Samuels 35, Deonarine 5) Deonarine had a modest series against Australia in April, with one fifty in three Tests. He gets his first boundary here with a crisp straight drive off Onions, who has come on to replace Bresnan.  58th over: West Indies 147-4 (Samuels 36, Deonarine 5) Samuels is playing Swann with something close to contempt. Another firm straight drive is half stopped by Swann, which probably saved three runs. One from the over. Tea has been put back to 4.10pm so that we don&apos;t have a three-hour final session.  59th over: West Indies 147-4 (Samuels 36, Deonarine 5) A rare false stroke from Samuels, who prods absent-mindedly at Onions and edges on the bounce to first slip. A maiden.  60th over: West Indies 149-4 (Samuels 37, Deonarine 6) Swann has a strangled LBW when Deonarine props forward and gets an inside edge onto the pad.  61st over: West Indies 149-4 (Samuels 37, Deonarine 6) This is impressive work from Onions, who has ripped Samuels from his comfort zone. He beats him outside off before digging in a short ball that follows Samuels, who does well to get on top of it. Then Samuels is beaten again, wafting loosely outside off stump. An outstanding maiden over.  62nd over: West Indies 151-4 (Samuels 38, Deonarine 7) &quot;Sitting at square leg, so hard to tell, but is Strauss just being lazy by leaving Swann on?&quot; says Michael Jelley. &quot;Couldn&apos;t Finn have bashed a new batsman about? Swann doesn&apos;t seem to be posing a challenge from where I&apos;m sitting...&quot; I assume he&apos;s loath to overwork the fast bowlers ahead of the long final session, and Swann is bowling well enough to Deonarine.  WICKET! West Indies 152-5 (Deonarine c Strauss b Onions 7) The Samuels/Onions contest is put on hold when Samuels gets a single \u2013 but that allows Onions to dismiss Deonarine, who fiddles at a shortish ball outside off stump and edges straight to first slip. Onions spins on his heels so that Samuels can&apos;t miss his celebratory pose. The two of them have been chatting away for the last 10 minutes or so. In fact it was similar to the Jimmy Anderson video that was posted earlier in the day.  63rd over: West Indies 152-5 (Samuels 39, Ramdin 0) Graham Onions&apos; figures reflect an excellent return to Test cricket: 17-5-32-2.  64th over: West Indies 164-5 (Samuels 50, Ramdin 1) Samuels dances down the track and drives Swann disdainfully over wide mid on for six. What a wonderful stroke. The next ball is lashed through the covers for four to bring up to a superb fifty. Samuels waves his bat to the crowd \u2013 and then waves it theatrically at Graham Onions. Great stuff. I can&apos;t remember the last time a touring player embellished a series quite as much as Marlon Samuels has here. Any suggestions? Brett Lee and Shane Warne lit up 2005, of course. &quot;Hey Rob,&quot; says Clare Davies. &quot;I can sum up all my emails (that didn&apos;t get sent, bloody tech issues) with this. Onions is fit in all senses of the word. However reading OBO brings back childhood trauma. Heating leftover food in the microwave leads to pain. Taking a short break to shower and hair wash leads to wickets!&quot;  65th over: West Indies 164-5 (Samuels 50, Ramdin 1) Onions bowls a maiden to Ramdin, which is a shame for those who wanted to see him bowl at his BFF Samuels. That&apos;s the end of an enjoyable session, and a good one for England: they took four wickets for 79 runs, the majority of which were scored by Marlon Samuels. See you in 15 minutes for the evening session.  66th over: West Indies 164-5 (Samuels 50, Ramdin 1) Tim Bresnan starts the session with a maiden to Samuels. &quot;Don&apos;t cheapen this, guys,&quot; says Jeff Goines. &quot;You lot and your talk about unfulfilled talent, like you&apos;ve been keeping the keenest of eyes on Marlon Samuels for years, just aching for that moment when he finally breaks free of those immature shackles... Please. He barely registered before this series, and you know it. Can we not just hail his performances as the wondrous surprise that they have been, without resorting to saying you knew all along?&quot; That&apos;s not strictly true. Anyone who saw his debut series in Australia in 2000-01, when he earned that most priceless of badges \u2013 praise from Steve Waugh \u2013 knew he was enormously talented. It&apos;s true that he was filed under &apos;irredeemable underachiever&apos; a long time ago, though.  67th over: West Indies 171-5 (Samuels 55, Ramdin 3) Finn replaces Onions and is driven brilliantly through extra cover for four by Samuels. Apart from that dodgy little spell against Onions he has been quite imperious. &quot;It might just be the music snob in me, but was anyone else a bit disappointed with Swann after that Small Talk interview from yesterday?&quot; says Dan Lucas. &quot;I mean, the Stone Roses? Really? He&apos;s not a Mancunian so I&apos;m actually surprised he remembers them.&quot; I don&apos;t understand. Are you saying the Stone Roses were rubbish? Because if you are, well, bye!  68th over: West Indies 171-5 (Samuels 55, Ramdin 3) Bresnan picked up Ramdin twice at Trent Bridge with induckers, and he seemed to move a bit wider on the crease in that over in an attempt to create the angle. Ramdin defends comfortably enough. A maiden.  69th over: West Indies 179-5 (Samuels 60, Ramdin 6) Ramdin moves across to work Finn through midwicket for three, and then Samuels cleaves a short ball between gully and backward point for four. What an innings this has been.  70th over: West Indies 184-5 (Samuels 64, Ramdin 7) Swann replaces Bresnan, who will presumably rest until the second new ball. Samuels drives him for yet another four. Swann responds with a flighted delivery that takes the inside edge before looping back down the pitch but short of Swann. Well bowled.  71st over: West Indies 184-5 (Samuels 64, Ramdin 7) Jonathan Trott is on for Finn. That&apos;s slightly surprising; you&apos;d have thought Finn could have had two more overs so that Trott only has three before the second new ball. Anyway, he starts with a maiden to Ramdin. &quot;Jeff Goines has a small point but he&apos;s more wrong than right,&quot; says Nicholas. &quot;Forget the debut vs Australia, I recall Samuels scoring one of the best ODI hundreds ever, vs India and flashing that red piece of rag Waugh gave him.&quot;  72nd over: West Indies 185-5 (Samuels 65, Ramdin 7) &quot;I&apos;m not getting any more e-mails published, am I?&quot; says Dan Lucas. &quot;The Stone Roses were the worst thing ever to happen to British music.&quot; Oh dear.  73rd over: West Indies 188-5 (Samuels 66, Ramdin 9) Trott is bowling very straight, as you&apos;d expect, and Ramdin works one off his pads for two.  74th over: West Indies 190-5 (Samuels 66, Ramdin 11) Blah blah etcetera.  75th over: West Indies 194-5 (Samuels 69, Ramdin 11) Look, between us, there&apos;s nothing to see for the next 20 minutes or so. Both sides are marking time until the second new ball. Trott continues and Samuels works him for two.  76th over: West Indies 199-5 (Samuels 69, Ramdin 16) Ramdin gives Swann the charge and heaves him over midwicket for four.  77th over: West Indies 201-5 (Samuels 71, Ramdin 17) What comes next in this sequence: 13, 27, 40, xx. The answer is actually 41, because those are the Tests of his career in which Marlon Samuels has made centuries. He made one in the last Test at Trent Bridge and looks a pretty sure thing here. He manipulates Trott for two to move into the serene seventies. &quot;In response to Nicholas, I&apos;ve seen a lot of sparkling early innings from a lot of players who have gone on to do naff-all else really,&quot; says Jeff Goines. &quot;My point is, if you or anybody else says you expected anything other than a workable-to-ignominious showing from him in this series then you&apos;re either an unfairly disenfranchised genius, or a purveyor of pork-bothering pies.&quot; I agree with that completely; the suggestion that nobody recognised his enormous talent is another matter.  78th over: West Indies 203-5 (Samuels 71, Ramdin 19) Bresnan replaces Trott, which means he&apos;ll have two overs before England take the second new ball. Ramdin pulls a short ball for a couple to bring up an important fifty partnership. &quot;Dearest Rob,&quot; says Phil Sawyer. &quot;Ah, the Stone Roses. I was living in Blackpool when the played their legendary gig at the Empress Ballroom in 1989. I was also pretty much the only person in Blackpool who didn&apos;t go to the gig, on the grounds, I seem to recall, that I &apos;couldn&apos;t be arsed&apos;. An early portent, in my teenage years, of my impressive ability to let opportunity slip through my fingers.&quot;  79th over: West Indies 208-5 (Samuels 76, Ramdin 19) This is another wonderful drive from Samuels, threated between extra cover and mid off for four off Trott. This has been an utterly gorgeous innings. &quot;I know the tendency is for spinners to bowl long spells but given Swann&apos;s strike rate in his first over it&apos;d be interesting to see what would happen if he was bowled in more frequent, shorter bursts. I&apos;m sure Bresnan would happily play the cart-horse and take on the extra burden of bowling the missing overs.  WICKET! West Indies 208-6 (Samuels LBW b Bresnan 76) I think Samuels will get away with this. He was hit on the pad by an excellent nipbacker from Bresnan and given out by Tony Hill, but I reckon he might have got outside the line. No, he&apos;s out! Hmm. Almost all of the contact was outside the line of off stump\u00a0\u2013 but there was just enough in line for it to be &apos;umpire&apos;s call&apos;, so Tony Hill&apos;s original decision stands. I have a fair bit of sympathy for Samuels there, not least because I wanted him to get this century his sublime batsmanship merited. What a huge bonus for England. Not just a wicket with the old ball, but the wicket of Samuels.  80th over: West Indies 208-6 (Ramdin 19, Sammy 0) Tim Bresnan is pure gold. That was an outstanding delivery, particularly with an 80-over-old ball. &quot;I know the tendency is for spinners to bowl long spells but given Swann&apos;s strike rate in his first over it&apos;d be interesting to see what would happen if he was bowled in more frequent, shorter bursts. I&apos;m sure Bresnan would happily play the cart-horse and take on the extra burden of bowling the missing overs.  81st over: West Indies 210-6 (Ramdin 20, Sammy 0) Steven Finn takes the new ball, and Matt Prior Levyashins to his left to make an excellent save from an errant short ball.  82nd over: West Indies 215-6 (Ramdin 22, Sammy 3) Sammy edges a lifter from Onions not far short of Pietersen at gully. England are one wicket away from the tail. &quot;I like Hawkeye a lot and I support the DRS, but I remain troubled by the use of the umpire&apos;s call for the ball hitting the pad outside off stump,&quot; writes  Marlon Samuels  Gary Naylor. &quot;I know the system&apos;s cameras are much faster than the ones used for television, but there must still be a significant window in which the ball is &apos;between frames&apos;. And I&apos;m pretty sure that an umpire (by design or default) used to give it not out if he believed that any portion of the ball was outside off stump when it hit the pad. Marlon Samuels was pretty unfortunate there.&quot;  83rd over: West Indies 216-6 (Ramdin 22, Sammy 4) Ramdin is beaten by another of beastly Gillespie deliveries from Finn, which lifts and seams past the outside edge. At some stage in the next few years, Finn is going to take seven or eight for not many in a Test innings. &quot;At the risk of turning you into Steve Wright in the Afternoon, could I possibly have a shout out for my little sister who just went through 44 hours of labour and an emergency c-section to give birth to my first nephew, a whopping great fella by the great cricketing name of Dexter?&quot; says Kieron Shaw. &quot;Talk about a slow delivery, etc.&quot; Well done Dexter and Dexter&apos;s mum! I was never any good at shout outs.  84th over: West Indies 220-6 (Ramdin 22, Sammy 8) The beauty of Onions, as has been said many times, is that he doesn&apos;t give batsmen a moment&apos;s peace. All he does is nag nag nag nag NAG. There are very few deliveries you can leave. Indeed Sammy plays at all six in that over. After five dot balls, he drives a nice boundary through the covers.  85th over: West Indies 224-6 (Ramdin 26, Sammy 8) Ramdin reaches for a wide outswinger from Finn and edges a booming drive just over the leaping slip cordon for four. As the deviant said to his protege, if you&apos;re gonna flash ...  86th over: West Indies 230-6 (Ramdin 26, Sammy 14) Sammy gets his secound boundary with a high-class back-foot drive off Onions, who then beats him with a textbook outswinger. There are 12 overs remaining.  87th over: West Indies 233-6 (Ramdin 27, Sammy 16) Andrew Strauss has dropped a sitter. Sammy drove at a marvellous full-length delivery from Finn that seamed away to take the edge. It went straight to Strauss at first slip, but he shelled a routine thigh-high chance. That&apos;s the third simple slip chance England have put down in the slips today, two off Finn and off Onions.  88th over: West Indies 241-6 (Ramdin 35, Sammy 16) Ramdin, trying to leave one from the new bowler Bresnan, inadvertently steers it low through the cordon for four. A big edge two balls later also goes for four, this time in the air through the vacant third-slip area.  WICKET! West Indies 241-7 (Sammy c Strauss b Finn 16) All&apos;s well that ends well. Another edge from Sammy off Finn, and this time Strauss at first slip takes the catch comfortably. He hasn&apos;t forgotten the dropped catch two overs ago and throws the ball away in disgust, almost braining Graeme Swann in the process.  89th over: West Indies 242-7 (Ramdin 35, Narine 1) The left-handed Sunil Narine is the new batsman. It&apos;ll be great fun watching him bowl tomorrow.  90th over: West Indies 251-7 (Ramdin 43, Narine 2) Ramdin gets consecutive boundaries off Bresnan with a flick through backward square leg and a wristy thump through midwicket. West Indies will be pretty pleased with this score, certainly from 152 for five.  91st over: West Indies 259-7 (Ramdin 46, Narine 7) Narine slashes Finn square on the off side for four, a nice stroke with which to get your first boundary in Test cricket. Seven overs remain in this long day.  92nd over: West Indies 264-7 (Ramdin 47, Narine 11) Almost a fourth wicket for Bresnan, with Narine edging a good delivery on the half volley at first slip.  93rd over: West Indies 267-7 (Ramdin 49, Narine 11) Steven Finn&apos;s work is done for the day. He will step into the ice bath with figures of 22-6-65-2, and Graham Onions should bowl the last three overs of the session from this end. He beats Sunil Narine with another fine delivery that snakes away off the seam. That&apos;s followed by a half shout for LBW against Narine; it pitched well outside leg stump. Not interested! Onions ends an excellent over with a brilliant seaming lifter that beats the outside edge.  94th over: West Indies 267-7 (Ramdin 49, Narine 11) Another big part of Bresnan&apos;s appeal is his indefatigability. This is his 24th over of the day, and you&apos;d expect two more after this. That&apos;s a serious shift, yet there has been no reduction in effort or accuracy. A maiden to Ramdin, who remains on 49.  WICKET! West Indies 267-8 (Narine b Onions 11) Onions gets his third wicket as Narine gets an inside edge back onto the stumps. That tight wicket-to-wicket line pays off again.  95th over: West Indies 267-8 (Ramdin 49, Rampaul 0) Rampaul survives a huge shout for LBW second ball. He was plumb in front but the ball pitched miles outside leg stump and Andrew Strauss correctly decides not to review. Onions loves bowing to left-handers: 42 per cent of his wickets in his short Test career have been  freaks  left-handers.  96th over: West Indies 270-8 (Ramdin 50, Rampaul 2) A misfield from Bairstow allows Ramdin to scamper through for the single that brings him to a determined half-century. It&apos;s his first in Tests since November 2009. There are two overs remaining.  97th over: West Indies 277-8 (Ramdin 57, Rampaul 2) Ramdin edges Onions in the air for four more, this time through maybe fifth slip. You can&apos;t really criticise Andrew Strauss for that one. I can&apos;t even remember the last time England had a fifth slip. Sabina Park 2004?  98th over: West Indies 280-8 (Ramdin 60, Rampaul 2) That&apos;s the end of a long and hard-fought day&apos;s play. England are slightly on top, although West Indies would certainly have taken this score when they were put in this morning. And tomorrow we get to see Sunil Narine bowl.

A strict curfew was imposed at the weekend on four towns, including the state capital Sittwe, but clashes between Buddhists and Muslims continued late into Sunday night. The Muslim district of Nazir in Sittwe was set ablaze in the latest of a series of arson attacks across the state carried out by groups on both sides. Chris Lewa, head of the Arakan Project, an international agency monitoring Burma&apos;s westernmost state, said witnesses had reported between 50 and hundreds dead. Multiple reports from sources on the ground alleged that security forces had opened fire on Muslims in the town of Maungdaw, where foreigners are forbidden to enter. An Arakanese agency worker living in Bangkok told the Guardian her family home in Nazir had been razed and a family friend, a former politician, had been killed. Her father was missing, while three of her friends, all former staff at the office of the UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR), were also detained. &quot;It seems police are targeting the educated people like they did in Cambodia,&quot; she said. A Maungdaw resident, who asked not to be named, said police had shot dead two Arakanese looters during the night. &quot;Muslim houses in Bhumu village [near Maungdaw] are on fire and other houses in Ward 5 are also on fire&quot;. He added that the arson was being carried out &quot;in front of the police&quot; and members of an Arakanese paramilitary group known as Lun Htin. EU spokesperson Maja Kocijanic said: &quot;We believe that the security forces are handling this difficult intercommunal violence in an appropriate way.&quot; UNHCR has evacuated staff from Maungdaw, at the centre of last week&apos;s unrest. Locals who had been sheltering in the UNHCR compound were forced to flee. The turmoil was triggered by the killing of 10 Muslims aboard a bus in central Arakan last week. The attack followed the alleged gang rape and murder of an Arakanese woman on 28 May by three Muslim men, who have since been detained. Six boats carrying wounded escapees from Sittwe are stranded at the mouth of the river Naf, which separates Burma and Bangladesh. Lewa said Bangladeshi border units were barring them from docking, and Bangladeshis who tried to send assistance were blocked. The UNHCR spokesperson in Geneva, Andrej Macehic, said he was awaiting a response from Dhaka, having lobbied the Bangladeshi government &quot;to allow safe haven on its territory for those who need immediate safety and medical assistance&quot;. President Thein Sein last night opened the door to military intervention by declaring the first emergency rule since coming to power in March last year. Observers fear the unrest could embolden Burma&apos;s military to take greater control of the country after it handed power last year to a nominally civilian government. The opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, is due to travel to Europe this week but may cancel if the situation deteriorates.", "publicationDate": "2012-06-11T16:56:20Z", "tags": ["South and Central Asia", "World news", "Bangladesh", "United Nations", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/11/burma-clashes-muslims-buddhists-arakan", "title": "Burma clashes kill scores despite curfew imposed in Arakan state", "sentences": ["An Arakanese agency worker living in Bangkok told the Guardian her family home in Nazir had been razed and a family friend, a former politician, had been killed."]}, {"article": "As uncertainty continued to dog the markets, that did not stop the odd takeover tale appearing. The latest involved Royal Dutch Shell, which was said to be interested in Paris-listed oil group Maurel &amp; Prom. The French group has a presence in Africa and Latin America, works in 11 countries and is currently valued at \u20ac1.2bn although gossips suggested Shell would have to pay substantially more to win the day. That would give Shell a lot to think about - it is also considering its next move concerning Mozambique-focused Cove Energy, where it has been outbid by a $1.9bn offer from Bangkok-based PTT. Shell A shares finished 21.5p higher at \u00a320.60. Overall the market mood could best be described as fragile, as investors continued to be unconvinced by the weekend&apos;s Spanish bailout and nervous ahead of the Greek elections at the weekend. Rising bond yields in Spain and - the next in the firing line? - Italy typified the uncertain tone for the day. But following Monday&apos;s falls there was an element of a relief rally, unconvincing though it may have been. The FTSE 100 finished 41.37 points higher at 5473.74, while most European markets also edged ahead, although Italy was an exception. There was a mixed picture among leading shares with safe stocks like cigarette companies in demand. British American Tobacco added 45p to \u00a331.56 and Imperial Tobacco was 28p better at \u00a324.06. Miners were mixed, with Randgold Resources rising 165p to \u00a357.65 following the gold price higher, but Polymetal down 19.5p at 790p. Icap added 9.2p to 346.5p following a buy note from Faraday Research. Analyst David Lowery pointed out that Icap benefited from increased trading during volatile markets, and an escalation of the eurozone crisis with Greece leaving, while bad for the global economy, could be good for Icap. Insurer Resolution edged up 0.8p to 195.3p despite the departure of Evelyn Bourke, chief executive of its Friends Life heritage business (the run-off vehicle of the group), who will reportedly join Bupa. Analyst Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said the news was disappointing for the company:  We regard Evelyn very highly indeed and view her departure from Resolution, and Heritage in particular, as a severe blow to the business. To us, the key aspect of the Resolution investment case is predicated on the cash generative characteristics of Heritage, especially as we remain unconvinced by the potential and profitability of the new business offering of Resolution. To this end, Evelyn&apos;s expertise in this area was crucial. A great win for Bupa, a big and bad loss for Resolution.  We reiterate our hold recommendation with the departure of Evelyn Bourke possibly symptomatic of more deep-rooted issues with the business.   Meanwhile analysts at Jefferies said a possible special dividend from the business could be put on hold. Analyst Abid Hussain attended a dinner with Friends Life chief executive Andy Briggs and said:  The special dividend is unlikely to be announced with half year results, in our view. We believe the economic capital position is unlikely to have improved significantly since the year-end as the benefit of narrower credit spreads and retained earnings is partially offset by weaker equity markets and lower gilt yields. Management is clear in that it intends to improve the economic capital and reduce volatility before considering a return of capital to shareholders. In our view this makes any potential return of capital at the half year unlikely if markets remain at current levels.  [Elswhere] the FSA is set to rule on whether FTSE 100 corporates can keep a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange (i.e. remain a FTSE 100 company) if the business is effectively run by external managers with no direct accountability to shareholders, as is the case with the advisory company set-up by Clive Cowdery which is contractualised to advise the Resolution board. In our opinion, a negative ruling in early July will result in negative sentiment for the stock, but in reality the likely transition arrangements coupled with the targeted 2014 exit strategy may make this a non-event. Management will ultimately defend the premium listing.    Chip designer Arm slipped 1.5p to 504p on worries about growing competition from Intel in the smartphone sector, and the fact that a key customer Apple announced no new blockbuster products at its latest developer conference. Among the mid-caps oil explorer Ophir Energy, which has projects in Tanzania, Gabon and Kenya, dipped 0.5p to 604p even though UBS began coverage with a buy rating and 740p target. The bank said Ophir&apos;s assets in Gabon were being overlooked by the market, and tipped it as a &quot;highly compelling M&amp;A story.&quot; Analyst Melanie Savage said:  Ophir has a highly desirable suite of assets, with gas discoveries offshore Tanzania potentially building up towards a two-train LNG project. We expect Ophir to seek to monetise this asset once it has drilled out additional prospectivity. Recent activity in neighbouring Mozambique sets the stage for outside interest.

The 66-year-old former political prisoner and head of Burma&apos;s National League for Democracy is due to address the UN&apos;s International Labour Organisation in Geneva on Thursday at the beginning of a 17-day tour of five countries, including the UK. It is the first time in 24 years that The Lady, as she is known, has visited Europe since returning from Oxford to her native Myanmar, as Burma is now renamed. She spent the majority of those years under house arrest. In a packed itinerary, she will fly from Geneva to Norway&apos;s capital, Oslo, for what is expected to be an emotional acceptance speech on Saturday for her Nobel peace prize, awarded to her 21 years ago. It was collected by her husband, the Oxford academic Dr Michael Aris, who died in 1999, and their two sons, Alexander, then 18, and Kim, then 14. She was unable to receive it in person due to a deep-seated fear that if she left Burma, where she has been a unifying symbol for freedom and democracy, she would be unable to return to continue her nonviolent struggle against a repressive military junta. The head of the Nobel committee, Thorbjoern Jagland, said he thought her long-delayed acceptance speech &quot;will be one of the most historic events in Nobel peace prize history&quot;. While in Norway, she will also visit the Rafto Foundation in Bergen, named after Norwegian human rights activist Thorolf Rafto, which awarded her the Rafto prize in 1990. On Monday, a concert in her honour is being staged in Dublin, Ireland, where U2 frontman Bono will present her with the Ambassador of Conscience award, Amnesty International&apos;s most prestigious honour. She arrives in Britain on Tuesday, her 67th birthday, and is expected to enjoy a family gathering, possibly meeting with the two grandchildren she has never seen. She is due to receive an honorary doctorate at Oxford, where she studied and later lived with her husband and their young sons. In London, she will address both houses of parliament in Westminster Hall \u2013 a rare honour usually accorded only to heads of state. The last stop will be France, after she was personally invited by the new President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. In April 1988, Suu Kyi left her family in Oxford to nurse her dying mother in Myanmar. As the daughter of Burma&apos;s independence hero Gen Aung San, she was swept to the forefront of an uprising against the military regime. At the time, she said: &quot;As my father&apos;s daughter, I felt I had a duty to get involved&quot;. She was viewed as such a threat to the junta she was kept isolated and under house arrest for 15 of the next 22 years. She was released for the last time in November 2010. In April, she won a seat in the lower house (Pyithu Hlattaw) of Myanmar&apos;s parliament. This is her second overseas visit having only recently been granted a passport. She recently spent five days in Thailand where she addressed the World Economic Forum on East Asia in Bangkok. Her visit comes as Myanmar president Thein Sein, whose government has been praised for recent reforms, struggles to contain sectarian violence in western Myanmar between Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims, which has claimed at least 21 lives since Friday.", "publicationDate": "2012-06-13T22:47:24Z", "tags": ["Aung San Suu Kyi", "UK news", "Switzerland", "Europe", "World news", "Nobel peace prize", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/13/aung-san-suu-kyi-switzerland", "title": "Aung San Suu Kyi arrives in Switzerland", "sentences": ["She recently spent five days in Thailand where she addressed the World Economic Forum on East Asia in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "     Almost a quarter of a century since she last set foot in Europe, the Burmese pro-democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi kicked off a five-country tour in Switzerland on Thursday, welcoming the international community&apos;s efforts to strengthen reform in her homeland. The 66-year-old former political prisoner, kept under house arrest for 15 of the last 22 years, addressed the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in Geneva, her first engagement in a whirlwind tour certain to elevate further her status as an international political celebrity. Now a member of parliament in Burma, the Nobel peace prize laureate welcomed steps to reach out to her country, which has long been isolated because of its military dictatorship. Wearing trademark flowers in her hair, the Lady, as she is known, was given a rapturous welcome by the ILO, an organisation she chose to address because of its long campaign against child and slave labour in Burma. &quot;The international community is trying very hard to bring my country into it, and it&apos;s up to our country to respond the right way,&quot; she said. &quot;Any new investment that comes in because of the lifting or suspension of sanctions should add to the democratic process rather than subtract from it,&quot; she later told reporters. She also urged foreign governments not to allow their companies to form joint ventures with Burma&apos;s state-owned oil and gas company until it improved its business practices. The tour, which also takes in Norway, Ireland, Britain and France, will be the first opportunity for western leaders to analyse Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s transition from prisoner of conscience during years of detention to stateswoman. The red carpet is being rolled out during the 17-day visit, seen as another milestone in Burma&apos;s political progress, under which recent reforms by the Burmese president, Thein Sein, have led to a lifting of sanctions. Especially emotional for the mother of two will be a return to her &quot;beloved&quot; Oxford, where she studied and later settled with her husband, the academic and Tibetan expert Dr Michael Aris, who died from cancer in 1999 having been refused a visa to visit the wife he had been able to see only five times in the previous 10 years. The couple raised their sons, Alexander, 38, and Kim, 34, in the city and she is due to receive an honorary degree at a ceremony at Oxford University next Wednesday. Another engagement will be when she addresses both houses of parliament in Westminster Hall on Thursday, an honour that has been accorded in recent times to Nelson Mandela, in 1996, Barack Obama, in 2011, Pope Benedict XVI, in 2010, and the Queen. It has never before been bestowed on the leader of an opposition party. Ireland will host an Electric Burma concert on Monday, during which U2 frontman Bono will present Aung San Suu Kyi with the &quot;ambassador of conscience&quot; award, Amnesty International&apos;s most prestigious honour. The show will also feature Sir Bob Geldof and the Riverdance troupe. &quot;To be allowed to honour this woman is an honour in itself. The heroine of dignity, integrity, courage and steely moral vigour lost her freedom and her family in order to gain a nation. Ireland is ennobled by her visit,&quot; Geldof said. Bono has reportedly lent Aung San Suu Kyi his private jet to fly her to Ireland from Oslo, where she will finally give her acceptance speech on Saturday, 21 years after being awarded the Nobel peace prize and lauded as &quot;an extraordinary example of civil courage&quot; and &quot;important symbol in the struggle against oppression&quot;. It was accepted by her son, Alexander, then 18, who received a standing ovation when he said his mother had accepted it &quot;in the name of all the people of Burma&quot;. His voice trembled as he spoke of his wish that soon she would be able to &quot;speak directly for herself, instead of through me&quot;. More than two decades later that moment is poised to be one of the tour&apos;s highlights. The head of the Nobel committee, Thorbj\u00f8rn Jagland, said her acceptance speech &quot;will be one of the most historic events in Nobel peace prize history&quot;. The European tour is only the second time Aung San Suu Kyi, the daughter of General Aung San, regarded as the founder of modern Burma and who was assassinated when she was two, has left the country since she returned to nurse her dying mother in 1988. She recently attended the World Economic Forum for East Asia in Bangkok. Her passport has only recently been returned. She was deemed a threat to the ruling military junta when she emerged as a unifying symbol of a free Burma during the 1988 pro-democracy uprisings, which were brutally quashed by the military regime. She was forced to spend long, lonely years incarcerated in her dilapidated lakeside villa in Rangoon. Though at times free to leave the country, she never did amid fears she would be refused re-entry. Among her lifelines were a piano and the BBC World Service \u2013 she had a special fondness for Dave Lee Travis&apos;s music programme, and the DJ hopes to meet her during her UK visit. Her sacrifice \u2013 staying even as her husband was dying in England, unable to see her sons \u2013 has earned her iconic status comparable with Mandela. Her campaign of non-violent opposition, which gained her the &quot;Steel Butterfly&quot; sobriquet, saw her receive an array of human rights awards and gain a high profile that afforded her some protection. Aung San Suu Kyi was released from her last period of house arrest in November 2010, and in April this year won a seat in the lower house of the Burmese parliament.

It&apos;s the simultaneous pursuit of the interrelated goals of ecological integrity, social equity and economic welfare. It recognises that all life is underpinned by the goods and services provided by nature, and acknowledges the moral obligation of contemporary society to the wellbeing of both present and future populations. Twenty years ago, there was a horticulture farm in the street I grew up on in Melbourne, Australia. Now, Melbourne is one of the largest cities in the world by area, with one of the lowest population densities. Urban sprawl engulfs valuable productive land on the edges of cities, and leads to inefficient and unsustainable rates of resource consumption. Together with the relatively affluent lifestyles of Australians, urban sprawl contributes to Australians having one of the highest ecological footprints and rates of per-capita greenhouse gas emissions in the world today. But there have been many positive changes, too. I&apos;m based in Bangkok, where air pollution declined 50% in the decade to 2007 through stricter emissions controls for cars, increasing taxes on two-stroke motorcycles, and introducing new public transport systems. Although there&apos;s still a way to go in improving Bangkok&apos;s air quality, this is a great achievement, particularly considering there wasn&apos;t even a word for &quot;pollution&quot; in Thai four decades ago. I often reflect on the distressing irony that here, in the Greater Mekong region, peoples&apos; lives are \u2013 and will be \u2013 hardest hit by the consequences of environmental degradation and climate change, despite having had limited contributions to creating these problems. The World Bank ranks Vietnam as the second, fourth, and 10th most vulnerable country in the world to sea-level rise, storms and flooding respectively, and Cambodia, Laos and Thailand as the fourth, sixth and ninth most vulnerable countries to flooding, under climate change. An interdependent world requires global ethics. I hope that Rio+20 results in an owning of our shared responsibility to each other and the Earth we depend on, and an authentic commitment to action. It is a condition for the survival and progress of humankind, and the meeting of human rights. I hope it inspires individuals to make better lifestyle and consumer choices, and motivates governments and the private sector to transition to green economies, where standards are set and met, efficiencies are maximised, resources are priced appropriately with externalities accounted for, innovation is supported, and natural capital is protected and enhanced. Science points to the tipping points we are fast approaching. I feel like Rio+20 will be a critical moment in history where the fate of everyone, present and future, will be determined, for better or for worse. But I believe humanity possesses the collective intelligence and resourcefulness needed to solve the problems it faces and move forward sustainably. When I think of the success of the phasing out of CFCs to stop ozone depletion, and declining rates of cigarette smoking, two issues linked to cancer and premature death, I am reminded of humans&apos; ability to rise to challenges in which their quality of life, and ultimately their existence, is threatened. I would also like to believe that humanity possesses the character to end selective moral disengagement on sustainable development at Rio+20, and use these abilities to serve all humankind.", "publicationDate": "2012-06-15T09:21:00Z", "tags": ["Environmental sustainability", "Global development", "Rio+20 Earth summit", "Global climate talks", "Sustainable development", "Environment"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jun/15/rio20-voice-bangkok-thailand", "title": "Rio+20: A voice from Bangkok, Thailand", "sentences": ["I&apos;m based in Bangkok, where air pollution declined 50% in the decade to 2007 through stricter emissions controls for cars, increasing taxes on two-stroke motorcycles, and introducing new public transport systems.", "Although there&apos;s still a way to go in improving Bangkok&apos;s air quality, this is a great achievement, particularly considering there wasn&apos;t even a word for &quot;pollution&quot; in Thai four decades ago."]}, {"article": "&quot;Are you coming to Rome for a\u00a0holiday?&quot; the snowy-haired Italian sitting next to me on the plane asked. &quot;Actually, no,&quot; I said. &quot;I&apos;m coming to write about taxi drivers. And their favourite places to eat.&quot; The man, an engineer and hobby archaeologist who was born and raised in Rome, slapped his hand to his forehead. &quot;Our taxi drivers,&quot; he shook his head, &quot;are terribili!&quot; He was not the first person to warn me about taxi drivers in Rome. Year after year, they are voted among the worst in the world. According to a\u00a02011 EuroTest report by 22 European automobile clubs, &quot;Rome&apos;s taxi drivers are aggressive, do not respect speed limits and traffic lights, and take long detours off the requested route.&quot; In other words, if there was any city where taxi drivers were going to take me for a ride, it was Rome. But however naive it might have sounded to the Roman I met on the plane, I\u00a0believed that some of the capital&apos;s 8,000 tassisti would show me where to find good things to eat in their city. I based this belief on a steak. Five years ago I decided to climb into a\u00a0random cab in Buenos Aires and ask the driver to take me to his favourite restaurant. After the taxista delivered me to a transcendent bife de lomo at a side-street steakhouse called Parrilla Pe\u00f1a, I started hopping into cabs in Buenos Aires, Berlin and New York, asking drivers where to eat and documenting my discoveries on a\u00a0blog called taxigourmet.com. In New York, I met two female cab\u00a0drivers who showed me the way to Jamaican curried goat and Puerto Rican mofongo \u2013 and convinced me that I could drive a yellow taxi, too, which I did, for a year, chauffeuring everyone from hysterical brides to ex-New Yorkers searching for pastrami. No one, my colleagues taught me, knows a city better than a cabbie. And four trips to Italy had taught me that few people know food better than Italians. What would happen if\u00a0I tested these two truths in Rome \u2013 a\u00a0city\u00a0with some of the greatest food, and some of the most notorious taxi drivers, in the world? &quot;Buona sera,&quot; I said to the tassista who was parked, along with six of his colleagues, next to the Esso station on Piazza Albania. He winced at my accent and started rolling a\u00a0cigarette. &quot;I&apos;m looking for a cheap restaurant not too far from here,&quot; I continued. &quot;I never eat at restaurants around here,&quot; he said.     The trio of 'pizzaioli' at Pizzeria Remo. Photograph: Alamy    A tassista in a brown T-shirt with an opera singer&apos;s belly stepped out of his cab. &quot;Go to Testaccio,&quot; he said. &quot;There are lots of restaurants there. You&apos;ll find something.&quot; &quot;No, no,&quot; I said. &quot;I&apos;m a taxi driver, too. I want to go somewhere you would eat.&quot; &quot;Somewhere I would eat?&quot; the cigarette-rolling cabbie said. He looked at the chubby tassista. They started laughing. &quot;Hey!&quot; said the chubby tassista. &quot;What about Remo?&quot; &quot;Si!&quot; said the cigarette-rolling cabbie. &quot;Remo! They have good pizza.&quot; &quot;Can you take me there?&quot; I said. &quot;You don&apos;t need us to take you!&quot; said the cigarette-rolling cabbie. &quot;Turn right at the signal, then left, then right. It&apos;s on Piazza di Santa Maria Liberatrice. There&apos;s a\u00a0pharmacy across the street.&quot; I&apos;d already started to question the stereotypes about Roman cabbies on the walk to Pizzeria Remo and one glance at the Italian families celebrating on Tuesday night at the restaurant&apos;s pavement tables and one bite of pizza bianca con fiori di zucca \u2013 with olive oil, mozzarella, courgette flowers and a sprinkling of anchovies \u2013 moved me to outright optimism. True to Roman tradition, the toppings were spare but fresh, and the crust, thinner than the plate, charred on the edges, chewy but soft, was the masterwork of a trio of bandana-wearing pizzaioli who manned the wood-burning oven next to the entrance of the restaurant. The\u00a0tassisti could easily have driven me in circles before dropping me off here, I\u00a0thought, but they didn&apos;t.     Layne Mosler in her cab in New York. Photograph: Rumen Milkow    Were the tassisti at Piazza Albania the exception rather than the rule? The next day I walked to the taxi stand at Piazza Bologna, 4km north-east of the city centre, to find out. Rossella Falasca was driving the cab at the front of the queue. &quot;You won&apos;t find Roman food in this neighbourhood,&quot; said Falasca, who has been driving for nine years and is one of approximately 1,200 female cabbies in Rome. &quot;You have to go to Testaccio or Trastevere. But that way,&quot; she pointed to Via Sambucuccio d&apos;Alando, &quot;is a good seafood restaurant. I went there a few days ago.&quot; Marco Magliozzi, the owner of La\u00a0Fraschetta del Pesce, was amused that a tassista had sent me to his restaurant. &quot;Our pasta boiler is broken,&quot; said Magliozzi, who worked as a fisherman and owned three fish stores before he opened La Fraschetta this March. &quot;But we can do some antipasti, maybe a fritto misto for you.&quot; What followed \u2013 calamari with olive oil and lemon, mussels steamed with garlic, leeks and Castelli Romani white wine, grilled sea bass, crab and shrimp \u2013 were glorious expressions of what Magliozzi calls cucina alla marinara: simple dishes designed to showcase the quality of &quot;our seafood&quot;. After I met Simone Bellini, my rising faith in the food knowledge of Roman cab drivers reached fever pitch. The tassista led me to fantastic versions of rigatoni alla carbonara and trippa alla Romana at La Tavernaccia da Bruno \u2013 a family-run trattoria a few blocks from where the cabbie grew up, near the train station in Trastevere. He also insisted I try La Nuova Cantinetta, an archetypal Roman trattoria in Garbatella where he eats rigatoni alla pajata (with tomato sauce, milk-fed calf intestines and pecorino Romano) every week. Reality hit after I took the underground to Cinecitt\u00e0, the film studio where Federico Fellini made La Dolce Vita. There, on the outskirts of Rome, I hoped to find a tassista who could show me a restaurant that wasn&apos;t in a guidebook. Instead I met a\u00a0cabbie who told me about a\u00a0&quot;terrible&quot; taxi driver in Bangkok who cheated him, as he took the long way to the centro storico before delivering me to a restaurant where he tried to negotiate a kickback from the hostess in exchange for bringing me there. Cinzia Perroni, a professional soprano who has been moonlighting as a tassista for five years, tried to explain the behaviour of her unscrupulous colleagues. &quot;Before, some Roman cab drivers were dishonest because they were stupid,&quot; she said. &quot;Now it&apos;s out of necessity. There are too many taxis and not enough passengers. But there&apos;s something really weird and really fun about this job. And I love to eat!&quot; She wrote down the addresses of seven of her favourite restaurants, including Il Tunnel, where she&apos;s been eating risotto alla crema di scampi since she was a girl. &quot;It&apos;s the best in Rome,&quot; she told me. I didn&apos;t actively seek out female cab drivers in Rome \u2013 but they seemed to have the most interesting stories and the best food recommendations. Tassista Laura Piccolo, who studied mathematics before she started the job 12 years ago, was, I thought, a\u00a0case in point. But as we searched for a\u00a0trattoria she wanted to show me, she circled the same block three times \u2013 and left the meter running. When she found the place, it was closed. Was the cabbie trying to cheat me? In the end we stopped at Perilli, Piccolo&apos;s favourite place for rigatoni alla carbonara. It said \u20ac18 on the meter, but she wouldn&apos;t take more than 12. &quot;I got lost, honey. You don&apos;t have to pay for that!&quot; She handed me her card: &quot;Call me later and tell me if you liked the carbonara.&quot; Layne Mosler is the author of the Taxi Gourmet blog (taxigourmet.com)  Six of the best cabbie-recommended restaurants in Rome     Giuseppe Ruzzeto, chef at La Tavernaccia da Bruno.

Talks on Iran&apos;s nuclear aspirations resume in Moscow on Monday, and western intelligence officials have told the Guardian the price of failure could be high. With Israel refusing to rule out military action if diplomacy fails, intelligence officials fear the volley of attacks carried out by Iranian operatives show Tehran is capable of an asymmetric response. Though the officials admit that predictions are extremely difficult to make, their concerns are based on investigations into plots against Israeli diplomats in India, Thailand and Georgia in February which point to the involvement of Iran. In India, local agencies told ministers a bomb attack which badly injured the wife of the Israeli military attach\u00e9 in New Delhi in February was the work of an Iranian &quot;security entity&quot;. Their conclusions have not previously been made public and Indian officials have made significant efforts to avoid blaming Tehran, an ally and oil supplier. The governments of Georgia and Thailand, which both uncovered bomb plots on the day of the Delhi attack, have also not officially blamed Iran. European intelligence officials told the Guardian they now found it difficult to judge Tehran&apos;s &quot;risk calculus&quot;. &quot;Until recently it was possible to see why they were doing what they have been doing,&quot; one intelligence official said. &quot;Now it has become very unpredictable. It&apos;s very hard to see the logic behind [the February bombings], other than perhaps demonstrate an ability to cause problems in the event of war or a desire for revenge of some kind.&quot; Tehran, which said the Delhi bombing was a &quot;false flag&quot; operation by enemies hoping to smear Iran, insists its nuclear programme is peaceful. Israel and western countries say Tehran aims to build nuclear weapons and have imposed a series of sets of sanctions over the last five years. Israel has repeatedly threatened military strikes. Expectations of the talks in Moscow on 18 and 19 June are low. Police evidence, witness statements and court documents seen by the Guardian, plus interviews with local and international law enforcement and security officials, indicate that the attempted triple-bombing on 13 and 14 February was conducted by a well co-ordinated network of about a dozen Iranians and prepared over at least 10 months. The evidence includes the identification of at least 10 Iranians allegedly involved in the plots, money transfers to key individuals from Iran, the use of Iranian phone connections and the flight following the attacks of conspirators to Iran. &quot;The question is not was this Iran-backed or Iran-organised but who in Iran was running all this,&quot; said one western security official. The first elements of the plot were put in place in April 2011 when at least five Iranians who have been implicated in the attacks travelled to Thailand and India, apparently on reconnaissance missions, investigators say. Their journeys came around four months after a spike in tension between Iran, Israel and the west following the killing in Tehran of Majid Shahriari, a nuclear scientist, by a bomb stuck to his vehicle by a motorcyclist. They also followed reports that Israel and the US were to blame for a computer worm called Stuxnet, which infected the operating systems at Iran&apos;s uranium enrichment plant in Natanz. Travel documents, phone records, police inquiries and customs data show how, in a series of trips by key individuals over the summer and autumn of 2011, flats were hired, local helpers recruited, transport arranged, finances organised and surveillance of targets carried out. Houshang Afshar Irani has been identified by Indian police as the man who attached a magnetic charge to the car of the wife of the Israeli defence attach\u00e9 in Delhi. Copies of his passport show he first visited the city in April 2011 for 10 days before returning on 29 January this year. At 11.30pm on 13 February, almost seven hours after reaching the Indian capital&apos;s main airport 75 minutes after the bomb attack, he flew to Malaysia and then on to Tehran via Dubai. Analysis by Indian investigators of the type of explosive used in Delhi reveal it to be a variant of TNT. The shell of the bomb was manufactured outside India and magnetic strips used to attach the device to the car in Delhi were identical to those recovered in Bangkok and Tbilisi. The attack in Bangkok involved at least five people, all Iranians. One, a 31-year-old woman identified as Leila Rohani, visited Thailand twice in 2012 and rented the house off the central Sukhumvit Road that was partly destroyed when 28-year-old Saeed Moradi, also Iranian, appears to have prematurely detonated a device. Moradi, who suffered serious injuries, was arrested. From Bangkok, Rohani travelled to Kuala Lumpur and then on to Tehran, investigators have found. A second alleged conspirator was detained at the airport, also en route for Tehran. This man, Sedaghatzadeh Masoud, 31, is believed to be the overall co-ordinator of the international operation. Masoud is in custody in Malaysia, pending possible extradition to Thailand. As in Delhi, a reconnaissance trip also appears to have been conducted in Thailand in April 2011. Members of the cell were pictured with bar girls in the sleazy resort of Pattaya days before the blast. Details of the Tbilisi plot and its links to the other two attacks are less clear. Indian investigators say the mobile phone number used by Irani, the alleged Delhi bomber, during his 2011 visit to India was also used in June last year in the Georgian capital, linking the two plots. There are questions about who might be responsible within Iran. One possibility is that the attacks were sub-contracted to the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group. The attack came close to the fourth anniversary of the assassination of Imad Mughniyeh, its operations chief, in a car bombing in Damascus. A team of top Indian police officers has been set to travel to Tehran for several weeks but the trip now appears unlikely to go ahead. Analysts speculate that one reason India may have been chosen as a location for the attacks is that their perpetrators could count on the desire of Delhi to keep friendly relations with Tehran and to &quot;go easy&quot; on any investigation or prosecution. &quot;Let&apos;s just say the demands of diplomacy and those of police work don&apos;t necessarily always coincide,&quot; said one senior Indian police officer involved in the investigation. India has, however, asked Interpol and the Iranian ministry of foreign affairs for assistance in its inquiry.

Yet the scene at 3.15pm on 13 February was anything but calm. A grey Toyota Innova people carrier was in flames with its two occupants, the wife of the Israeli defence attach\u00e9 and her driver, on the ground nearby. Police and bystanders tried to call ambulances but none were available. More people milled around another vehicle, its windows blown in. As ever in India, there was much shouting, pushing and sirens. The perpetrator was already heading out of the country and back to Iran. His victims were put in a three-wheeled motorised rickshaw and sent to the nearest hospital. The attack was one of three incidents over a 36-hour period that had taken at least 10 months to plan. On the day of the Delhi bombing \u2013 which involved a device the size of a large smartphone stuck to the side of the diplomatic car with magnetic strips \u2013 a second bomb was found attached to an Israeli diplomat&apos;s vehicle in Tbilisi, Georgia. The day after, an explosion destroyed much of a house in a lane off the central Sukhumvit Road in Bangkok. A 28-year-old Iranian stumbled out and threw makeshift grenades at taxi drivers and police, before collapsing, badly injured. It did not take long for Iran to be blamed. Rogue elements The attacks followed months of escalating tension between Tehran and its enemies, particularly Israel. In the preceding weeks, Iran tested new missiles, boasted of breakthroughs in technology that could bring development of a nuclear weapon nearer, and threatened to shut down shipping in the Strait of Hormuz if further western sanctions were imposed over its nuclear programme. The EU responded by imposing new sanctions, including a curb on petroleum imports, the latest in a series of economic measures introduced since 2006 that had started to bite on the Iranian economy. In October a bizarre plot to kill the Saudi Arabian ambassador in Washington had been uncovered by US authorities, blamed on possible &quot;rogue&quot; elements within the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. Israel and the US were reported to have been behind a computer worm called Stuxnet, which infected the operating systems at Iran&apos;s uranium enrichment plant in Natanz and contributed to its temporary shutdown in November 2010. A succession of attacks on Iranian nuclear scientists deepened the mood of mistrust. In November 2010 Majid Shahriari, a nuclear scientist, was killed and Fereydoon Abbasi Davani, Iran&apos;s atomic chief, survived an attack by assailants on motorcycles. In January this year, another prominent scientist, Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan, died after a magnetic bomb was attached to his car, the same modus operandi as the Delhi bombing a month later. &quot;We will not neglect punishing those responsible for this act,&quot; Iran&apos;s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said after Ahmadi-Roshan&apos;s death. General Masoud Jazayeri, the spokesman for Iran&apos;s joint armed forces staff, said simply: &quot;The enemies of the Iranian nation, especially the United States, Britain and the Zionist regime, or Israel, have to be held responsible for their activities.&quot; An editorial in a hardline newspaper close to Khamenei said ominously that Iran had long experience of conducting assassinations overseas and was well-placed to extract revenge. Shadow war It is not known when or by whom the plots were conceived. But investigators in Delhi and Thailand know when those involved began preparations. Houshang Afshar Irani, the man accused of the Delhi bombing, first arrived in the Indian capital on 25 April 2011. Irani stayed in Delhi for three weeks, leaving in mid-May. Based at a mid-priced hotel in the city&apos;s central Connaught Circus, he spent hours, investigators say, researching possible targets. They say he also spent time with at least three call girls, contacted through an intermediary who had placed advertisements in local newspapers. The first visit to Thailand came around this time too. A 31-year-old woman, identified as Leila Rohani, arrived in Thailand on a tourist visa on 17 April last year and stayed for four weeks. The summer appeared to see a pause in the &quot;shadow war&quot; between western intelligence agencies and Iran with diplomacy returning to the forefront. But preparations for an operation continued. Rohani returned to Thailand in July, staying until September. In June, a mobile phone number used by Irani in Delhi in April was used for a two-week period in Tbilisi, one of the few links between the Georgia plot and the others. Meanwhile, Mohammed Kazmi, a 50-year-old journalist in Delhi who worked for Iranian news organisations, travelled twice to Tehran where, according to Indian investigators, he met two Iranian men involved with the plot and received $5,500. The detained journalist also helped Irani conduct surveillance of the Israeli embassy and other potential targets, investigators claim. Kazmi&apos;s family told the Guardian he was innocent of any wrongdoing and the victim of a conspiracy by &quot;major powers&quot; to defame Iran and Muslims. Preparations continued through the late autumn. On 18 October, Rohani returned to Thailand. Two months later, on 19 December, she rented a house on Soi Pridi Phanomyong in central Bangkok that became the bomb factory, Thai investigators have revealed. Through late December and January, as tensions mounted once again between Tehran, Israel and the west, at least six more Iranians arrived in Bangkok and Delhi. Western intelligence services believe the trigger for the attacks may have been the death of Ahmadi-Roshan. There is no &quot;smoking gun&quot;, but western officials believe circumstantial evidence is sufficient to indicate that the plot originated with &quot;an element&quot; of the Iranian state. After completing their investigation, Indian intelligence agencies told senior ministers that Tehran was behind the attack. Israeli officials immediately went much further, explicitly blaming Iran for the bombings and claiming that the plot was part of a wide-ranging campaign to launch violent attacks against Israeli interests across Asia and beyond. Officially, all three countries where the February incidents occurred have refrained from blaming anyone publicly. Iran is a big oil supplier to India and good relations with Iran are seen as key to India&apos;s traditional non-aligned foreign policy in west Asia. &quot;If the Iranians chose India because they thought Delhi wouldn&apos;t make too much of a fuss, they&apos;ve been proved right,&quot; said one western diplomat in the Indian capital. Asymmetric capability Though Indian authorities have posted Interpol notices for suspects in the Delhi bombing, including Irani, a trip by senior policemen from the capital&apos;s serious crimes department to Tehran has been repeatedly stalled. The question of ultimate responsibility within Iran remains unclear. Most analysts discount the use by Tehran of a proxy such as the militant group Hezbollah. More likely, they say, the plot was an attempt by elements within the Revolutionary Guards to show an &quot;asymmetric capability&quot; to deter western or Israeli military strikes on Iranian nuclear installations and to indicate that the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists would not go without a response. Forensic analysis in Thailand, Georgia and India has revealed that all devices in the plot were composed of explosives \u2013 C4 plastics combined with either TNT in India or a urea fertilizer mix in Thailand \u2013 enclosed in a hard container which had been imported. Magnetic strips were used in India and Georgia to fix the bomb to vehicles. &quot;You could chose any number of targets or types of attack. Why go to the trouble of replicating exactly how [the scientist] was killed in January in Tehran unless you want to make a point?&quot; the western official said. Experts point out that the effective command structure of the Revolutionary Guards, as with all elements of the Iranian security establishment, remains poorly understood and that pinpointing who was in overall charge of the plot is very difficult. What is now known, however, is that the weeks after the killing of the scientist in Tehran saw new activity. On 8 February, according to immigration records, Saeed Moradi, the Bangkok bombmaker, flew into the Thai resort of Phuket. With another Iranian, Mohammed Khazaei, he then travelled to the sleazy resort of Pattaya, where the pair were photographed on a phone &quot;smoking and drinking with bar girls&quot;. Irani had flown in to Delhi on 29 January, staying this time in a hotel in the west of the city but once again contacting call girls. Two weeks later, CCTV footage shows him leaving the hotel on a red Honda Pulsar motorcycle. At 3.15pm, as the Israeli embassy car stopped at lights at the junction in Delhi, Irani pulled up next to it, placed the magnetic bomb against its rear side and rode away. By 4.30pm he was at Delhi&apos;s international airport where he checked in for Malaysia Airlines flight MH191 to Kuala Lumpur. Before midnight, Irani was on his way out of India, later heading back to Iran on a connecting flight that left the following morning via Dubai, investigators believe. In Bangkok things went less smoothly. The blast at the bombmaking factory and the struggle that followed led to Moradi losing both his legs and being detained. Khazaei was also picked up. Finally \u2013 and perhaps most damaging of all \u2013 a 31-year-old Iranian identified as Sedaghatzadeh Masoud was arrested at Kuala Lumpur aiport as he waited to board a flight to Tehran on the morning of 15 February. His passport included visas both for India and Thailand and a notebook that included phone numbers for many of those identified in Tblisi, Delhi and Bangkok as well as in Tehran. This was the first major breakthrough for investigators. Rohani, who had rented the house, had left Bangkok in early January. Her whereabouts are unknown. * An inaccurately captiioned picture was removed from this article on Monday 18 June", "publicationDate": "2012-06-18T11:05:00Z", "tags": ["Iran", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "India", "Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "Israel", "Georgia", "Europe"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/17/iran-nuclear-revenge-bomb-plot", "title": "How Iran's revenge bomb plot over nuclear programme took shape", "sentences": ["The day after, an explosion destroyed much of a house in a lane off the central Sukhumvit Road in Bangkok.", "Two months later, on 19 December, she rented a house on Soi Pridi Phanomyong in central Bangkok that became the bomb factory, Thai investigators have revealed.", "Through late December and January, as tensions mounted once again between Tehran, Israel and the west, at least six more Iranians arrived in Bangkok and Delhi.", "On 8 February, according to immigration records, Saeed Moradi, the Bangkok bombmaker, flew into the Thai resort of Phuket.", "In Bangkok things went less smoothly.", "His passport included visas both for India and Thailand and a notebook that included phone numbers for many of those identified in Tblisi, Delhi and Bangkok as well as in Tehran.", "Rohani, who had rented the house, had left Bangkok in early January."]}, {"article": "Starting out in business can feel like a lonely journey. Whether you&apos;re up at 2am writing the business plan, dealing with rules and regulations before you open for trading, or negotiating the tricky task of securing external finance, it can sometimes feel like you&apos;re an army of one facing competition that&apos;s better resourced, more experienced and already in the game. Yet help, networking and sage advice are all closer than you might think. The internet is a treasure-trove of FAQs, and this new Guardian site provides many important resources if you&apos;re just starting out. Think local, but act global Linking up with other new starters and more experienced business people willing to lend a hand and offer advice is so important when sourcing new customers and opportunities. Chambers of commerce can help too, as they collectively hold more than 3,000 networking events nationally every year that allow members to make real business-to-business links \u2013 something that should never be underestimated by a new business seeking to sell into its immediate area, and especially if you&apos;re considering trading further afield. Networking with other companies early on can increase your chances of developing contacts in markets from Barcelona to Bangkok and Beijing. Many newly-minted business people tell me that it&apos;s at networking events that they meet international business people who become informal mentors and guides; some also meet their first international customers, and even their first international suppliers. So linking up with your peers can help you learn the ropes of worldwide trading early on, and build a global perspective into your business plan. By ensuring that your company is born global, considering overseas markets from your earliest days where that&apos;s appropriate, you can make a real difference to the success of your business, and to Britain as a whole. Businesses that are bold and break into new markets overseas will play a key role in sustaining an economic recovery in the UK. Your global business might have already started The beauty of international trade is that sometimes you don&apos;t know you&apos;re an exporter until you&apos;re actually doing it. Small, home-based companies have flatly denied being exporters to me, saying: &quot;I only post a few packets off to the continent.&quot; Yet from such humble beginnings come Britain&apos;s new global players. The Somerset company selling ice cream above the Arctic Circle; the Derby clockmakers selling timepieces to the Swiss; the London creative media business whose social media software has had over 1.4 billion users around the world; the Bradford textile manufacturer selling 90% of its products abroad; the Cumbria business selling top-quality food products from an idyllic Lake District setting into over two dozen countries. None of these is a large conglomerate, but all are growing strongly because they are bold, hard working and not afraid of taking risks. Technology can make global feel local There&apos;s no doubt that technology has revolutionised the business startup industry, helping new companies find new markets, and providing a shop window for both goods and services. It&apos;s now easier and faster than ever before to register and get trading. But never forget that so much in business is still done face-to-face. Networking is a critical part of your company&apos;s journey to success, as behind the core of every business is a real person. The same holds true for all your potential trading partners and collaborators, whether down the road or across the globe. Whether it&apos;s a meet-the-buyer event (where companies, including potential international customers, meet with potential suppliers), a sector group (gathering together businesses operating in the same sector to discuss common local and global challenges), a gathering of companies in your local town, or a one-to-one relationship with a businessperson who&apos;s been through the same first steps when seeking to trade at home or abroad, networking brings real benefits. So as you prepare to do battle as an army of one, or even as a company that&apos;s starting out with several employees, remember that you&apos;re not alone. There are legions of reserves, stationed close by that can help make your battle for business success into the victory of a lifetime.

The price may be prohibitive for most \u2013 \u00a35,000, say, for the Top Gun experience alone \u2013 but business is booming for Red Carpet Enterprises, the London-based events company that aims to tickle the fancy of the most jaded super-rich. Red Carpet is not alone in surfing the waves of cash that are still washing round those parts of the British capital that are relatively immune to double dip recessions, eurozone crises and cuts in public sector spending. Italian luxury brand Bulgari has just opened in London what it claims is the first newly-built five-star hotel for 40 years, where for \u00a3700 per night you can apparently enjoy an &quot;uncompromising sense of excellence&quot;. Around the corner in the same part of Knightsbridge, The Jet Business has recently opened what it claims is the world&apos;s first executive plane salesroom, where you can choose your new aircraft inside a full-size, mocked up interior of an Airbus. And all of this is a stone&apos;s throw from One Hyde Park, the &quot;oligarch silo&quot; where a penthouse suite can set you back \u00a3140m, but where you get SAS-trained security staff \u2013 as well as the ubiquitous gold taps \u2013 thrown in. Last week the annual World Wealth Report produced by Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management said that the global population of millionaires stood at 11 million \u2013 an elite club whose finances were riding out the financial storm, with their assets declining by less than 2% to $42 trillion (\u00a327tn). If there was a surprise, it was only that the Asia Pacific super-rich outnumbered those in north America for the first time in 2011. A recent luxury-goods market study by Boston Consulting Group predicted that spending on yachts, designer frocks and safaris would hit nearly \u00a31bn this year. But the study identified a shift in spending patterns among the wealthy, who are increasingly keen to buy luxury &quot;experiences&quot; rather than add to their wardrobes and car collections. More than half of the \u00a3900m spent on luxury goods last year bought one-of-a-kind holiday packages or stays in exclusive resorts such as luxury goods group LVMH&apos;s hideaway in the Maldives. &quot;It&apos;s all about storytelling,&quot; says Robert Gaymer-Jones, chief executive of the Sofitel chain, which, following several years of investment by French owner Accor, has been recast as a luxury brand complete with Herm\u00e8s toiletries in the en suites. He points to hotels such as the Sofitel Legend Old Cataract in the Nubian desert, where Agatha Christie wrote Death on the Nile. Visitors there, he says, feel like they are going back in time: &quot;Our clients don&apos;t want an ordinary experience.&quot; Making the dreams of the super-rich come true has proved to be a successful second career for Alan Rogers, a former general manager of Luton Airport, who now lives on a 17-acre estate in the Cotswolds complete with its own lake and manor house. The founder of Red Carpet says he has fewer corporate clients these days, as executives \u2013 particularly those at banks \u2013 are frightened of being accused of excess when many of their customers are struggling financially. But the market for the &quot;high net-worth wealthy&quot; is still the same, he reports, and he says he has never been asked for an exotic event or trip that he has been unable to fulfil. &quot;We organised for people to launch their own rocket at Kiruna in northern Sweden, and held a champagne reception on the helipad of the Peninsula Bangkok. If it&apos;s not physically impossible, or illegal, we can do it.&quot; Steve Varsano, founder of The Jet Business, has the same message. He spent a fortune decking out his sales office off Hyde Park, but will fly anywhere at the drop of a hat to sell planes that cost anything from less than $18m to over $80m. &quot;Business at the top end of the market is excellent, extremely strong,&quot; he reports, with Russian oil executives, Saudi princes and American technology entrepreneurs always game for a new &quot;time machine&quot;. Nothing is too much trouble: the Arab buyers may want seats that swivel to face Mecca, while the Chinese may want silk carpets and the Brits a replica of an old country pub. &quot;Certainly what we are seeing is the buying of bigger and longer-range aircraft so that the guy in Mongolia can do his business with the oil guy in Nigeria,&quot; says Varsano. The biggest growth in demand, perhaps unsurprisingly comes from China \u2013 up some 800% since 2003 \u2013 but there are still only 150 executive jets registered in China and 1,000 in the whole of Asia compared with 450 in England and 11,000 in America. Jets are now advertised in numerous magazines for the super-rich such as the Robb Report and the new periodical Elephant Lifestyle \u2013 slogan: &quot;Hit Big, Live Large&quot; \u2013 which claims to be the &quot;luxury living magazine for energy tycoons&quot;. It offers yachts, sports cars and even islands \u2013 all priced neatly in barrels of oil. Private Islands, a luxury estate agent, says that business slowed dramatically during the recession but has picked up strongly over the last year. It is currently marketing the $18m &quot;Cebaco private biosphere&quot; off the coast of Panama, which boasts &quot;palm-fringed coves with sandy beaches, cascading waterfalls and dramatic rock formations&quot;. &quot;We have seen an increase in inquiries from potential buyers as well as a healthy number of new islands coming on the market,&quot; says chief executive Chris Krolow, who adds that he has a number of islands in the $10m-plus range under contract. &quot;The general feeling is that island prices have finally bottomed out and investors are feeling that this is a good time to buy. This is a very exciting time in the island world.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-06-23T23:05:55Z", "tags": ["Retail industry", "Business"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/24/luxury-retail-defies-slump-things-only-money-can-buy", "title": "Luxury retail defies the slump by selling the things only money can buy", "sentences": ["&quot;We organised for people to launch their own rocket at Kiruna in northern Sweden, and held a champagne reception on the helipad of the Peninsula Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Disruptive innovation and social enterprise  Thomas Kreiner blogs for the Huffington Post about how innovative and affordable products and services, designed to meet the needs of the poor in some of the world&apos;s most underserved communities, can also benefit developed countries by disrupting markets in the manner of the mobile phone or the ink-jet printer.

Abdel Hakim Belhaj and his pregnant wife were abducted in Bangkok, allegedly tortured and then flown to Libya in March 2004, two weeks before Tony Blair paid his first visit to Gaddafi and declared that they had found common cause in the fight against terrorism. Sami al-Saadi, his wife and four children \u2013 the youngest a girl aged six \u2013 were detained in Hong Kong before being bundled aboard an aircraft and &quot;rendered&quot; to Libya two days after Blair&apos;s visit. Each man spent more than six years in custody. Legal proceedings are based in part on a secret cache of Libyan intelligence documents, discovered in an abandoned Tripoli office during last year&apos;s revolution, which appear to show Allen claimed credit for the tipoff that led to Belhaj&apos;s abduction. They also show that the CIA regarded the abduction of Al-Saadi and his family to have been a joint UK/Libyan rendition operation. Papers lodged at the high court on Thursday accuse Straw, Allen, MI6, MI5, the Foreign Office and Home Office of being liable for the families&apos; false imprisonment as well as &quot;complicity in torture and/or inhuman and degrading treatment; conspiracy to injure; conspiracy to use unlawful means; misfeasance in public office and/or negligence&quot;. However, the case is almost certain to fall foul of the controversial secret justice proposals of the government&apos;s justice and security bill, which aims to give ministers the power to ensure the public and media are excluded from civil trials in which the government itself is a defendant, and to deny claimants and their lawyers the chance to see and challenge evidence that government lawyers introduce in the government&apos;s defence. Sapna Malik of law firm Leigh Day said: &quot;It is extraordinary that in light of such clear evidence of the involvement of the British government, in what we believe was illegal activity, they have chosen the stock response of neither confirming nor denying their complicity. &quot;We can&apos;t help but make the link between our client&apos;s cases and the current obsession by this government on closed trials, which offend the fundamental principles of justice in this country and would succeed in hiding the truth behind these allegations and similar accusations of illegal activity by the security services on the instruction of politicians.&quot; Straw and Allen have declined to comment. An FCO spokesperson said: &quot;Civil litigation proceedings are under way, so we are unable to comment on the details of this case.

Absolutely loving every day, now in chang mai, was a 42-hour journey from start to finish but was great and some brilliant scenery. i sat with three Thai ladies and i let one of them use my glitter nail varnish and they LOVED IT!!!

I just wanna see if the receipt is still in the camera box bag, which I think I left in the lounge, because it should be under warranty but there&apos;s no rush also will you look into the insurance policy and see if its best if I say it was pickpocketed from a night market (easy) and get a police report and claim when I am home or is it covered under broken/lost in the policy? All my photos are safe though so its all fine!!!!! Love u!!!! xxxxxx Welcome reassurance after my swift and forceful reply Hello!!! No worries I won&apos;t say I was pickpocketed haha!!!!!

I had to lead the way through the jungle trying to make my elephant go by stroking his ears! Was HILARIOUS!!!! We have just arrived in Luang Prabang in Laos, we&apos;ve been to Vientienne (I think I&apos;m spelling all of these wrong) which was the capital and SOOOO quiet, bit weird town but we went to the most amazing temple called Wat Si Saket, google it and hopefully it will come up!

We have been to the killing fields and the genocide museum in phnom penh which was hurrendous but interesting, so shocking to think it all was happening so recently, we then all travelled together to siem reap, went for a massive night out and got a tuk tuk straight to angkor wat at 5 in the morning as apparently sunrise was meant to be amazing but it was totally cloudy and an absolute waste of time! But then we spent the rest of the day going around the temples and it was great, although I fell asleep on a wall and woke up with a load of Japanese ladies taking photos of me on their ipads! We also lost one of the boys in the group who was still totally drunk in one of the temples so drove around in a convoy of tuk tuks trying to find him and eventually found him asleep in a bowl of noodles in a restaurant absolutely miles away!!!!

Glad i&apos;ve done it though. See you very soon!!! xxxx On to New Zealand, and the allure of backpacking seems to be wearing off Am going to treat myself to some acrylic nails! Cause everything here is technically half price (well kind of, 50p to a dollar) so they are only about 20 quid!

Just to let you know, my car now has no insurance, I had an email about it a few weeks ago, so don&apos;t drive it unless you are insured differently! Also cant get my itinerary to open on this computer so i&apos;m not sure what time i&apos;m back, I think its half 4 in the afternoon. Right oh, had better run and try and get my deer antler through customs!! Wish me luck!! xxxx Given that neither of us knows when or at what time she&apos;s back, I can only hope that by the time you read this Lily has been safely re-patriated either with or without the antler.

A detailed breakdown of the royal family&apos;s \u00a36.1m official travel bill reveals charter flights for the tour cost \u00a3460,387 after officials determined it was not possible to fly scheduled. Expensive charters by the Duke of York, as UK special representative for international trade and investment, topped \u00a3350,000 last year, including \u00a381,000 for a six-day visit to Saudi Arabia and \u00a389,915 in scheduled air and charter costs for a six-day trip to China, Malaysia and Thailand. The costs, detailed in Buckingham Palace accounts, show the Queen&apos;s official expenditure increased last year by \u00a3200,000 on the previous year to \u00a332.3m. Sir Alan Reid, keeper of the privy purse, said spending had decreased by 26% in real terms over the past three years if inflation was taken into account. &quot;When the chancellor of the exchequer announced his plans for the public expenditure to reduce by 25% in real terms over a four-year period, the Queen was very keen that the royal household should play its part in reducing its expenditure accordingly,&quot; he said. The reduction was &quot;a year ahead of the public expenditure target&quot;, he added. The Queen cost every man, woman and child in the UK 52p over the year. Wages for her 300 staff, frozen for the past two years, fell \u00a3200,000 to \u00a310m compared to the previous year. Travel costs increased by \u00a3100,000, despite the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge getting an upgrade from BA for their one-way flight from Los Angeles to London at the end of their tour of North America. Even so, the bill was \u00a351,410 in business-class tickets for the couple and seven accompanying staff. As it turned out, the inflight entertainment was not working, so the couple did not get the full benefit of the upgrade. Prince Andrew accumulated the highest charter bills after his older brother. These included \u00a310,470 for an overnight trip from Northolt to Belfast, Teesside and back to Northolt. A scheduled return flight from Heathrow to Bangkok for him and aides cost \u00a329,946. His costs are expected to reduce next year after he relinquished his post following intense scrutiny of his relationships with controversial figures, including a convicted paedophile. Thirteen royal train journeys cost a total of \u00a3900,000. The most expensive undertaken by Charles \u2013 an overnight regional tour from Ayr through Middlesbrough, Redcar, Burnley, Stoke-on-Trent to London \u2013 cost \u00a338,016. At an average of \u00a342 a mile, the train is often criticised as too expensive. Officials, who say they never try to give the impression it is the best value for money, claim it is justified because it provides security and least inconveniences the public. The cost of Charles&apos;s travel was included in his accounts, published last week, though no detailed breakdown was given then. The pressure group Republic said royal aides were attempting to spin an increase in spending as a real-terms decrease. &quot;Compare these travel costs with those of the prime minister, who spent less than \u00a3500 travelling on Eurostar to a Paris meeting with former president Sarkozy last year and just over \u00a32,000 on a visit to Afghanistan to meet forces and local leaders,&quot; said Republic&apos;s chief executive, Graham Smith, who described the year-on-year increase as &quot;indefensible and morally repugnant&quot;. Of the \u00a319,583 cost of flying Charles and Camilla from Aberdeen to spend a day touring riot-torn London in August, he said: &quot;It beggars belief that it costs the taxpayer more to send Charles to east London than it does to send the prime minister to Afghanistan.&quot; Calling for a &quot;cost-benefit analysis&quot; of the trips undertaken by the royal family, Smith said: &quot;The costs published today are just the tip of the iceberg \u2013 the true cost of the monarchy is likely to be over \u00a3200m each year.&quot; The accounts, which detail only travel costs exceeding \u00a310,000, revealed \u00a33,506,485 was spent on journeys less than \u00a310,000. These included 153 journeys by the Queen&apos;s S76 helicopter, leased at \u00a31,435 per flying hour, and 62 by charter helicopter. As is usual, the finances did not disclose the amount of tax paid by the Queen on her private income from the Duchy of Lancaster. An aide stressed it was a &quot;private matter&quot; and joked: &quot;Nor is she in any of these Jimmy Carr schemes.&quot; The 2011-12 financial year was the last one in which the Queen&apos;s finances were funded by the civil list and government grants. For the current financial year the Queen&apos;s funding will come from a percentage of the profits of the Crown Estate, increasing her income to a projected \u00a336m next year. Aides said the extra money had been earmarked for urgent repairs to the royal palaces which had been put off for years because of a steady decrease in the Queen&apos;s income in real terms. &quot;It definitely won&apos;t be for any massive improvement in the quality of life for the royal household,&quot; said one. The Queen&apos;s year in figures \u2022 The Queen undertook 325 public engagements in the UK and 45 overseas. \u2022The Duke of Edinburgh undertook 330 official engagements. \u2022 Almost 3,000 official engagements in the UK and overseas were undertaken by members of the royal family during the year to 31 March 2012. \u2022 72 journeys cost more than \u00a310,000 each. \u2022 There were 26 investitures for 2,500 people. \u2022 The Queen entertained 33,000 people at five garden parties in Buckingham Palace and Holyroodhouse. The parties cost \u00a3800,000. \u2022 About 611,000 people bought tickets for the summer opening of Buckingham Palace&apos;s state apartments. \u2022 3,269 tonnes of carbon are due to be offset at a cost of \u00a336,000. \u2022 The average number of staff paid from the civil list was 300 \u2013 three fewer than last year \u2013 at a cost of \u00a310m in salaries, pensions and national insurance. \u2022 About \u00a3400,000 was paid for wine and spirits for entertaining. \u2022 Royal stationery cost \u00a3300,000 \u2013 up \u00a3100,000 on the previous year. \u2022\u00a0This article was amended on 4 July 2012 to remove a reference to Prince Charles&apos; Scottish home in Birkhall being near Ayr.", "publicationDate": "2012-07-02T17:53:33Z", "tags": ["The Queen", "Monarchy", "UK news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/02/queen-accounts-reveal-travel-bill", "title": "Queen's accounts reveal \u00a36.1m travel bill for royal family", "sentences": ["A scheduled return flight from Heathrow to Bangkok for him and aides cost \u00a329,946."]}, {"article": "An unbidden tip-off a decade ago brought surprising news. It was from a top agent who for years had been answering my question about emerging British tennis talent by swivelling his eyes as if accosted by a bothersome drunk. &quot;That question you keep on asking me,&quot; he said. &quot;There is someone. His name&apos;s Andy Murray.&quot; Despite having confidence in my informer&apos;s judgment, so well-acquainted was he with gimcrack goods being peddled as something superior, my first reaction was to doubt him. British tennis had delivered so many rising stars who turned out to be the Christmas-tree variety rather than the real nova \u2013 Martin Lee, Jamie Delgado, Arvind Parmar, Alex Bogdanovic etc \u2013 that my scepticism was difficult to suppress. How could he be so sure about Murray? All right, the teenager had appeared on tennis writers&apos; radar having excited expectation in Scotland, but what made him different from all the others who had registered promising results and then bombed? Shouldn&apos;t we be looking out for someone such as Tim Henman, who had risen without trace to reach a place in the world&apos;s top five in 2002? My caution lasted until January 2003 when Murray, playing in the scalding coastal heat of South America, won an under-18 event \u2013 he was still only 15 \u2013 on the International Tennis Federation&apos;s world junior circuit. His success followed two good title wins in Europe towards the end of 2002. Maybe my contact was right. My call to Murray&apos;s mother, Judy, herself a very good player, was instructive. &quot;He said he was going over to these tournaments in South America and he was going to win all of them,&quot; she said. &quot;I said, &apos;Yes, right, these are group ones and group twos. You&apos;ve never won any of those before&apos;.&quot; Her response was the one most mothers would have given a cocky child, even if her son&apos;s brashness was something she probably quite liked. Raising expectations of what he might achieve was something she and coach Leon Smith had been working on, the reason they had bypassed the British options and sent Murray to the highly respected S\u00e1nchez-Casal academy in Barcelona in 2002. By now he had the physical presence to give real vim to a game that was mature beyond his years. The wee mite had shot up in a series of growth spurts to 6ft 2ins, while his feet just grew and grew, to size 11\u00bd \u2013 larger than any other player, man or boy, that his shoe sponsors supplied. In that 2003 conversation Judy Murray told me: &quot;We sent him to Barcelona because it would be hard to find a better place for him to learn his trade. He&apos;s 15 and he trains with a large group of players aged between 19 and 26 who are all between 140 and 400 in the men&apos;s world rankings. This is what it&apos;s all about, training with the men \u2013 not winning in the juniors.&quot; She told me, too, about an incident that made her realise that her son might be a bit special: &quot;I once took him to Glasgow to watch badminton, a game he had never played. We saw a match between the No 1 junior from France and England&apos;s No 1. At the end of the first game he said: &apos;If I was playing that guy I would first drop short and then lift the shuttle up the backhand side because he never moves back into the right place.&apos; He just has this very clever mind, very quick mind.&quot; As it happened Murray did not win all those tournaments in South America. After his success in Colombia, where he won without dropping a set, he reached the third round in Ecuador, the quarter-finals in Peru and Paraguay and the semi-finals in Bolivia. He was satisfied, though. &quot;I was pretty sure I was making progress,&quot; he said. It was Wimbledon-time 2005 that Murray&apos;s promise crystallised into something more significant, scattering the last fragments of my scepticism. Breaking through as a tennis player&apos;s tennis player \u2013 in other words, more Roger Federer with his breadth of strokes than Rafael Nadal with his more limited but brutal repertoire \u2013 he won his first match on the ATP tour when he beat Spain&apos;s Santiago Ventura at Queen&apos;s on 6 June; then at Wimbledon he lasted longer than any other British male, making it to the last 32 before, crippled by cramp, he surrendered a two set-advantage to the former finalist David Nalbandian. In the autumn he reached an ATP final, taking eight games off Federer in the title match in Bangkok, and soon afterwards took over the albatross of British hopes when he beat Henman in the first round of an indoor event in Basel. By the end of 2005 he had risen more places in the world rankings, from 449 to 65, than any other player. Federer at that time was firmly embedded as world No 1 \u2013 just one more indicator of the enduring quality Murray is up against on Sunday.

But this is no third-world country \u2013 it is the capital city of the richest nation on Earth. Washington DC&apos;s shockingly high place on the HIV infection table is a story of poverty, racial segregation and neglect, which many of those charged with tackling HIV here acknowledge is shameful while insisting it is now being addressed. But America&apos;s record on Aids in its own backyard, in the very shadow of the White House, will be forced into the spotlight later in July when Washington hosts the International Aids Conference, a mighty biennial gathering of scientists and campaigners, who inevitably end up embarrassing the political leaders of the host nation. It happened in Durban, when Thabo Mbeki was castigated for his doubts over the cause of Aids, and in Bangkok, where demonstrators protested over the jailing of IV drug users. The US has regularly been the subject of criticism \u2013 Barack Obama was criticised at the last event, in Vienna in 2010, over cuts in US Aids funding to developing countries. But this time, the event will be on his own turf and demonstrations are already being planned. Gregg Gonsalves, a leading Aids activist for over 20 years who now works and studies at Yale, is one of those who is deeply disappointed in Obama, for whom he voted. &quot;He hasn&apos;t invested a lot of political capital in HIV. I don&apos;t think it is a priority for him. He has cut Pepfar [the president&apos;s emergency fund for Aids relief, which helps developing country epidemics] by $200m. He has been an absolute disappointment.&quot; Gonsalves says the continuing infection rates in the US \u2013 50,000 a year \u2013 are shocking, and is concerned about the lack of attention to young, black gay men and does not understand why the president does not act to end the waiting lists for drugs. As of May this year, more than 2,700 people across 10 states were waiting for treatment \u2013 something that is hard to defend since studies last year showed that prompt treatment made people with HIV less likely to infect others. &quot;This is something he could do in the blink of an eye,&quot; said Gonsalves. What Washington DC, with the highest HIV rate in the US, has in common with Aids-afflicted Africa is a marginalised and impoverished population. As you take the Metro green line south, away from the downtown federal offices and upmarket bars where young and aspiring interns congregate, white people get off and African Americans get on. Before the train crosses the Potomac river, everybody in the carriage is black. Washington DC is recovering from the &quot;white flight&quot; that followed race riots in the 80s, but none of the young Wasps working in downtown DC and laughing in its bars in the early evening head home to Anacostia. HIV today is not the &quot;gay plague&quot; that hit San Francisco in the 80s. The worst affected are heterosexual African Americans. HIV is rife in places beset by poverty and low levels of education.  That is why Dr Lisa Fitzpatrick, an infectious diseases expert at Howard University, set up a pioneering HIV clinic just over a year ago at the United Medical Center in Anacostia \u2013 amongst the homes of the people who need her help. DC, she says, &quot;used to be 80% black. Now it&apos;s more like 60%. It is an area that is disenfranchised. It has high levels of illiteracy and poverty and huge health and social disparities.&quot; And Anacostia has greater concentrations of all these social ills than anywhere else in DC. Most of those who arrive at the clinic on the second floor of the vast plate-glass hospital building have come through the emergency room where they were persuaded to take an HIV test. A positive result is devastating, says Daveda Hudson, the patient navigator whose work is to connect those tested with medical care straight away. &quot;A lot of them are in a bad state,&quot; she says. &quot;Most people cry until they pass out and the they wake up and cry and pass out again. When you come into the ER because you have a sinus infection, it&apos;s not what you expect.&quot; Hudson&apos;s job is at the heart of what makes this clinic different. She gets the call and heads straight to ER to ensure this collapsed piece of humanity sees Fitzpatrick or a nurse practitioner immediately.  &quot;Just by getting people to walk through the door, you begin a relationship,&quot; says Fitzpatrick. It&apos;s not &apos;here is our phone number \u2013 call and get an appointment&apos;. Some places still do that.&quot;  Then there is a mental health assessment, which will reveal substance abuse and other issues that must be tackled if the patient is to be successfully treated. And it is vital to keep them linked in to the clinic. Antiretroviral drugs keep people with HIV alive and well and prevent them infecting others, but they must be taken regularly or they stop working.  Hudson, helped by other staff such as receptionist Shannon Strong, refuses to let these sometimes difficult and chaotic patents drift away from care. They will call people every day, visit them in their homes, sort out their housing problems, their kids&apos; schooling and their debts. The only way to defeat HIV in these entrenched and deprived places, they believe, is to take on the problems that make people vulnerable. They still lose some, says Fitzpatrick. &quot;Twenty percent of folks are still lost to follow-up,&quot; she says. &quot;For the city it is a serious problem \u2013 it is probably as high as 40%.&quot; But she too goes the extra mile to pull people in. &quot;Once I had to meet a patient on the street. I had to explain to him about HIV because he was afraid to come in. He had Aids and he thought he was going to die anyway. Everybody had been calling him. I said I could probably get him to come. He was homeless so I arranged to meet him. It was a busy avenue, so it wasn&apos;t unsafe. He showed up a week later at the clinic and he&apos;s still in care now. He is doing fine.&quot; David Catania, the outspoken independent chair of DC&apos;s health committee, blames previous administrations for failing to tackle the district&apos;s HIV epidemic. He tells a shocking tale of incompetence and neglect. &quot;It had been ignored for years and years,&quot; he says.  The HIV/Aids department went through many changes of name. &quot;I used to say it was like a witness protection program \u2013 it was so humiliated by what it was doing.&quot; When he became chair of the committee in 2005, he said, &quot;There was no epidemiology, because the whole thing was just a shit show.&quot; Vacancies were not filled or they were taken by people without the right skills, he claims. &quot;It is what happens when inertia hits a brick wall.&quot; They had no data about the types of people who were becoming infected to inform prevention programs and it was taking nine months to pay providers. &quot;What dollars we did spend got burned in a bonfire out the back. There was one instance where a guy used Aids money to refurbish a strip club. It was just a disgrace.&quot; One Inspector General&apos;s report after another told them how terrible their contract management was, he says. &quot;The way we fixed this was in a very Teutonic way, one step at a time,&quot; he says. He took over the HIV/Aids department and instituted &quot;a reign of terror&quot;. He outsourced the epidemiology to George Washington University and he believes they now have the best HIV data in the country.  They show a drop in the death rate from Aids and the numbers with HIV progressing to Aids. He brought in a major testing programme in the community and 100,000 people are now tested every year.  In the jails, people are tested unless they opt out and those with HIV are given continuing care on release. They gave grants and help to non-profits setting up Aids programmes in the poorest parts of the district. The infrastructure that existed was mostly for gay men, who were no longer the majority of those affected or at risk. He is very proud of what has been done, but he knows HIV will continue to be a very difficult issue for DC. &quot;The big question now is what do we do about this population of 3.2%? Every time that number plays it is a horrifying number. The only way to get that number down is for these people to die. The good news is that we have 3.2%. If we were another place that didn&apos;t take care of these individuals, we could quickly have a smaller population. They would simply die and we could start over. &quot;It is going to be unbelievably high for a long time. It takes some explaining to the poepulation \u2013 to say when things fell apart and we abandoned our responsibilities, we contributed to the epidemic.&quot; He knows Aids activists will be demonstrating in the streets of DC in July. &quot;They often believe the solution is simply more money,&quot; he says. &quot;It is not about more money. You can burn money in a bonfire as we have done in this city. It is a shortcut and it is a kind of cartoon version of health.&quot; If Washington has a grip on its epidemic amongst poor African Americans in the south it is still inadequately tackled, say campaigners. The waiting list for Aids drugs for those who cannot afford to pay for themselves tells its own story. Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and Virginia are among the states where people with HIV cannot immediately get the drugs they need to stay well and reduce their chances of infecting anyone else. Some states have lowered the income level at which people become eligible, squeezing some off the lists altogether. These are people who usually don&apos;t have a voice or a platform. The July conference will change all that.", "publicationDate": "2012-07-09T16:31:00Z", "tags": ["Washington DC", "US news", "World news", "Health", "Barack Obama", "Poverty", "Aids and HIV"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jul/09/aids-conference-washington-dc-epidemic", "title": "Aids conference forces Washington's epidemic into global spotlight", "sentences": ["It happened in Durban, when Thabo Mbeki was castigated for his doubts over the cause of Aids, and in Bangkok, where demonstrators protested over the jailing of IV drug users."]}, {"article": "Thailand has pardoned and set free an American who was jailed on charges of insulting the monarchy after posting online several passages from an English-language book about the king. Joe Gordon was convicted in December 2011 and given two and a half years for translating excerpts of the book The King Never Smiles from English into Thai and putting them online. The punishment was a high-profile example of the severe sentences meted out for defaming Thailand&apos;s royal family, an issue that has raised concern about freedom of expression in the kingdom. The pardon comes as Thailand&apos;s prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, is due to meet Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, in Cambodia this week. The Thai government would be keen to avoid attention being drawn to Gordon, who was first detained in May 2011, and others who have fallen foul of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 laws. There was anger across Thailand in May over the death in jail of Amphon Tangnoppaku, 61, who became known as Uncle SMS after he was given 20 years&apos; jail in November 2011 for text messages deemed to have insulted the monarchy despite claiming he didn&apos;t even know how to send a text. Gordon was freed from Bangkok&apos;s remand prison late on Tuesday, US embassy spokesman Walter Braunohler said. &quot;We are pleased that His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej granted Joe Gordon a royal pardon, which allowed him to be released from prison,&quot; Braunohler said. &quot;We urge Thai authorities on a regular basis, both privately and publically, in Bangkok and in Washington, to ensure that freedom of expression is protected in accordance with its international obligations.&quot; Gordon&apos;s lawyer, Arnon Numpa, said he would likely return to America within several days. Bhumibol, the world&apos;s longest-reigning monarch, is revered in Thailand and is widely seen as a stabilising force. But Thailand&apos;s l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 laws are the harshest in the world. They mandate that people found guilty of defaming the monarchy including the king, the queen and the heir to the throne face three to 15 years behind bars. Computer crimes laws also contain provisions that have enabled prosecutors to increase l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 sentences. Opponents of the laws say that while the royal family should be protected from defamation, l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 laws are often abused by governments to punish political rivals. That has been especially true amid the political turmoil that has followed a 2006 military coup. Many had hoped the administration of Shinawatra, which assumed power after elections a year ago and has prominent supporters who have been accused of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9, would reform the laws. The issue remains highly sensitive, however, and Yingluck&apos;s government has been as aggressive in pursuing the cases as its predecessors. Gordon posted links to the banned biography of the king several years ago while residing in the US state of Colorado. His case has raised questions about the applicability of Thai law to acts committed by foreigners outside Thailand. In the banned book, author Paul M Handley retraces the king&apos;s life, alleging that he has been a major stumbling block to the progress of democracy in Thailand by consolidating royal power over his long reign. Gordon, who lived in the US for about 30 years, was visiting his native country to seek treatment for arthritis and high blood pressure at the time of his arrest. After being repeatedly denied bail he pleaded guilty in October last year in hopes of obtaining a lenient sentence. The judge said at the time that the punishment, initially set at five years, was reduced because of Gordon&apos;s plea.", "publicationDate": "2012-07-11T03:30:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Freedom of speech", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/11/thai-king-pardons-american-insulting", "title": "Thai king pardons American convicted of insulting monarchy", "sentences": ["Gordon was freed from Bangkok&apos;s remand prison late on Tuesday, US embassy spokesman Walter Braunohler said.", "&quot;We urge Thai authorities on a regular basis, both privately and publically, in Bangkok and in Washington, to ensure that freedom of expression is protected in accordance with its international obligations.&quot; Gordon&apos;s lawyer, Arnon Numpa, said he would likely return to America within several days."]}, {"article": "Thailand&apos;s constitutional court has averted a looming political crisis after dismissing a highly controversial case that alleged MPs in the governing party were plotting to topple the monarchy by amending the constitution. Had the court sustained the complaint, it could have ordered the dissolution of the prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra&apos;s party \u2013 a move many feared would lead to large-scale street protests and violence. The case centred around an attempt by lawmakers from the ruling Pheu Thai party to establish a drafting committee to amend the constitution, which they claim is undemocratic because it was drawn up in the wake of the 2006 military coup that deposed Yingluck&apos;s billionaire brother Thaksin. In a swift verdict, the court ruled that &quot;there [were] not enough facts&quot; to prove the amendment aimed to overthrow the monarchy. It also ruled that the 2007 charter could be amended section by section, but not entirely rewritten. The controversial case was seen as the latest test of Yingluck&apos;s government, which came to power a year ago in a landslide election that many saw as a referendum on Thaksin&apos;s rule. Political clashes have repeatedly shaken the country&apos;s stability, and the threat of violence on Friday was real. Pheu Thai MP and United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD) co-leader Korkaew Pikulthong warned the Bangkok Post that &quot;civil war will take place&quot; if the court ruled unfavourably and issued a rally cry to supporters. &quot;Once you hear a whistle blow, pack your bags and bid farewell to your family.&quot; Riot police were on hand at the court and the military was also prepared to step in if needed, the government had said. Judges were protected by both police and bodyguards in the run-up to Friday&apos;s verdict as the court has removed two Thaksin-allied prime ministers in the past four years, as well as dissolved major political parties and banned top politicians from politics, moves that have sparked anger over the court&apos;s considerable political power. The verdict, which was read live on radio and TV, helped defuse fears of a return to past violence. In 2008, Thaksin&apos;s opponents seized the prime minister&apos;s offices for three months and Bangkok&apos;s two airports for a week. In 2010, Thaksin&apos;s supporters held street demonstrations that degenerated into violence and clashes with the military that left more than 90 people dead and almost 2,000 injured. The court&apos;s decision was delivered amid news that Thailand&apos;s King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 84, was being treated for a minor brain bleed after experiencing spasms of his right hand and a slightly quickened pulse.

Kallis helps himself to one more single, and that&apos;s it for the day. What a day for South Africa, and Hashim Amla in particular, who&apos;s closing in on a double century. Jacques Kallis didn&apos;t play too badly either; the same applies to Graeme Smith, who also made a century. England didn&apos;t do too much wrong, but their attack was unable to make any impact whatsoever. South Africa end with a lead of 18 and have eight wickets in hand. The task for them tomorrow is to build up a healthy lead before putting England in to bat. It promises to be fascinating. Thanks for reading.

Please don&apos;t sue me.  133rd over: South Africa 400-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 182, Kallis 80) Broad floats a filthy one up to Kallis. Four. Four hundred, as it goes.  132nd over: South Africa 396-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 182, Kallis 76) Jonathan Trott to bowl, and he concedes just the one run from it. &quot;Ok so am here with the already referenced Steve Harris and Claire Taylor and you must be able to tell how frustrated we are with England as focus of day has turned to us all getting mentioned on cricket blog!!&quot; says an excitable Ali Gilbert. &quot;Key question for Claire and I now is who is stand in fielder that keeps popping on the pitch?! Extremely cute bottom and only hopeful thing worth seeing before the close of game!!! Highlight of day however sexist it may sound!!! Fingers crossed for more actual England cricket tomorrow!!!&quot; How much sugar have you had today?  131st over: South Africa 395-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 182, Kallis 75) A smiling Stuart Broad is back out there now. I&apos;m hungry. &quot;It&apos;ll probably be Swann and Broad to bowl the last few overs, then to head for the ice baths,&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;Which raises a question: does the OBO writer have something cold to plunge fingers into at close of play, or do you do what I do - save it for the gin?&quot; I never leave home without my mini-freezer.  130th over: South Africa 394-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 182, Kallis 74) So, with five overs left today, South Africa are dominant. &quot;The pitch looks like a sandbox,&quot; says SB Tang. &quot;With two strong batting line-ups, a draw seems likely. Tahir will have to bowl well for the Saffas to win \u2013 a great chance for him to prove that he belongs as a front line Test spinner. I wonder if England will regret not picking Monty instead of Bopara? I&apos;m a Bopara fan but a second spinner would be handy on this pitch and Prior&apos;s been batting well enough to move up to no 6.&quot;  129th over: South Africa 391-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 182, Kallis 71) Superbly done from Amla, punching through the off-side for four, moving South Africa ahead. Bresnan grimaces. South Africa lead by six.  128th over: South Africa 384-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 176, Kallis 71) &quot;Can KP save us?&quot; says Claire Taylor-Harris. &quot;Please...after 8 hours we need something and people are starting to wail....or leave.&quot; Not on this evidence, a short ball from Pietersen that was just begging to be hit spanked away through cover for four by Kallis. Amla clips to square leg to level the scores.  127th over: South Africa 379-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 175, Kallis 66) Inch by inch, South Africa crawl towards England&apos;s total.  126th over: South Africa 378-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 175, Kallis 65) Kallis opens the face and edges away to the non-existent third man for four. He tries it again, but the shot isn&apos;t quick enough and he has to settle for two.  125th over: South Africa 371-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 175, Kallis 58) An appeal for lbw against Kallis, but he was outside the line. Nothing doing. &quot;Terribly sorry, Jacob, but I have to tell you that Steinberg actually means stone mountain,&quot; says Raymond, the Geordie in Germany. &quot;Steinh\u00fcgel would be stone hill. Then again if size does matter...&quot; My... my parents lied to me?  124th over: South Africa 366-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 174, Kallis 54) Anderson stares at Bresnan with a look of fury on his face after Bresnan had allowed an Amla shot past him. He uses language of the industrial nature to get his point across. &quot;A duck, dropping Amla when he was on 40 yesterday evening, and unimaginative field placings,&quot; says SB Tang. &quot;Not Andrew Strauss&apos;s finest hour as England captain. And now he&apos;s gone and smashed his sunnies. The poor man. At least it looks like his sense of humour&apos;s intact.&quot;  123rd over: South Africa 362-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 170, Kallis 54) A maiden over. South Africa, surprisingly, have taken their foot off the gas a bit. &quot;As with most Larry David episodes I just can&apos;t make it past the moment of embarrassment,&quot; says Ian Copestake. &quot;The prospect of the denouement is just too painful. Not unlike following this innings.&quot;  123rd over: South Africa 362-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 170, Kallis 54) Something like this would never happen in an OBO...  122nd over: South Africa 361-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 169, Kallis 54) There&apos;s still no sign of a breakthrough. Kallis nearly takes out a pigeon in Dick Dastardly style. &quot;We&apos;re trying all we can to rally the troops at the game here but drunkenly shouting &quot;come on ing-er-land&quot; is not helping,&quot; says Steve Harris. &quot;Some better chants are required.&quot; Or a man with a drum. They&apos;re always fun.  121st over: South Africa 359-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 168, Kallis 53) Hilarity alert! With Kallis and Amla running up and down the crease, Strauss goes for the bails, but as he does so, his sunglasses go flying up into the air and are taken out by his throw. They&apos;re completely banjanxed! Demolished. Blasted to smithereens. What are the odds? The England team collapse in a fit of giggles. Good to see they haven&apos;t lost their sense of humour despite today&apos;s travails. Speaking of broken glasses... &quot;Sadly GS4&apos;s goon intake was severely detailed by technical reasons (incompetence),&quot; says David Ward. &quot;Crossing guard goons have been despatched to the ground but are stuck behind Boris Johnsons bicycle in the VIP lane...&quot;  120th over: South Africa 355-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 166, Kallis 51) Here&apos;s Jimmy. Can he introduce any pep into this attack? No, although the runs have dried up a tad now. &quot;Good to hear Beefy proudly recalling going for 200+ her in 1987 and Athers light-heartedly recounting conceding 700 as skipper against the Windies in the 90s,&quot; says Mark Steward. &quot;There was us as young(ish)sters thinking it mattered. Sorry, not used to losing anymore, this might be a well-deserved refresher.&quot;  119th over: South Africa 355-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 166, Kallis 51) Do G4S have any hired goons going spare?  118th over: South Africa 353-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 165, Kallis 50) I really needed a maiden over there, seeing as I was having technical problems. And a maiden over is precisely what I got. This is increasingly grim.  117th over: South Africa 353-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 165, Kallis 50) Kallis drives through mid-on and there&apos;s his half-century. It&apos;s hard to see what England can do about this, beyond hiring some goons to forcibly remove these two from the crease.  116th over: South Africa 352-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 165, Kallis 49) Are nuts sweet? I never understand that phrase. Unless they are sweet. I don&apos;t know. I don&apos;t eat them, because you are what you eat #lol #banter.  115th over: South Africa 351-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 165, Kallis 48) Amla batters away a full toss from Swann away for four more. Swann is livid with himself, but nearly makes up for that with a devilish delivery that spins and catches out Amla. But misses the stumps by this much.  114th over: South Africa 347-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 161, Kallis 48) Bopara bowls a tad wide and Kallis gleefully snaffles four more. South Africa look like they could bat all year, let alone all day. &quot;Je suis desole,&quot; says Simon McMahon. &quot;I thought the OBO was a given, it&apos;s just that I&apos;m missing the likes of Atherton, Botham, Mikey and Bumble. Do you think they&apos;d understand if I asked politely to switch to the cricket tomorrow? Or would it be a case of &apos;start the car&apos;?&quot; It&apos;s a diddly of a pickle is what it is.  113th over: South Africa 341-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 160, Kallis 43) Swann is bowling well. Just a single from the over. &quot;Much as I am enjoying seeing SA put England to the sword, given the pitch and England&apos;s batting depth, I think a draw is probably the most likely result,&quot; says Richard Mansell, and who am I to disagree?  112th over: South Africa 340-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 160, Kallis 42) Amla scatters the pigeons with a beautiful drive off Bopara, even Bresnan&apos;s slide by the boundary not enough to prevent another four. There&apos;s a huge appeal with the last ball of the over, England claiming Amla edged into Prior&apos;s gloves. It&apos;s hard to hear anything. England don&apos;t review it and HotSpot didn&apos;t seem to show anything. &quot;Do you think Shane Warne may at this stage be revising his prediction of a series victory for England?&quot; says Mare Mouton. Not necessarily. There&apos;s a helluva lot of cricket still to be played.  111th over: South Africa 336-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 156, Kallis 42) A maiden over from Swann. &quot;Evening Jacob, or should I say Bonsoir,&quot; says Simon McMahon. &quot;They&apos;re not much interested in cricket here in Antibes in the south of France. Could you or your reader please advise how I can see Englands fightback tomorrow when everyone seems determined to watch cyclists parading around Paris? Merci.&quot; You mean following it on the OBO isn&apos;t enough for you? Ingrate.  110th over: South Africa 336-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 156, Kallis 42) Ravi Bopara gets a bowl. You&apos;ve got to hand it to England, they&apos;re trying everything, but Amla is unflappable. He cannot be flapped. He is totally flap-resistant.  109th over: South Africa 332-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 153, Kallis 41) That was drinks. Stuart Broad necked a gin and tonic. &quot;Seeing the ominous form Kallis is in, one wonders what the highest numbers of centuries for a team in a single innings is?&quot; says Pat vander Reest. &quot;I don&apos;t see them score more than 4 (they don&apos;t bat that deep), but that should surely be enough. Especially since de Villiers has been known to put in a decent shift once in a while.&quot; England could very easily draw this match though.  108th over: South Africa 329-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 152, Kallis 40) Bresnan tries to catch Kallis out with a high bouncer, but can&apos;t get enough pace on his delivery and Kallis pulls away for a single to finish off the over. Time for drinks. England could do with a stiff one.  107th over: South Africa 328-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 151, Kallis 39) To my left, Rob Smyth offers one of his famous statgasms: Graeme Smith has made 25 Test centuries and they&apos;ve never lost a match or a series when he&apos;s done so. Astonishing, and it doesn&apos;t bode well for England.  106th over: South Africa 325-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 150, Kallis 37) Kallis dabs away to third man to pick up a pair, before pulling a lengthy delivery from Bresnan away for four. One elegant shot follows another as he coaxes one excellently through cover for four more. They&apos;re making it look easy. Against the best side in the world, lest we forget.  105th over: South Africa 315-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 150, Kallis 27) Oh, that&apos;s lovely. Amla almost lazily drives a full delivery from Swann through cover for four, bringing him up to 150. He&apos;s had a glorious innings and shows few signs that his work for the afternoon is done. &quot;Glad to see you on the cricket, you could really do with being the charm that Bull used to be for England wickets-get dancing,&quot; says Michael Jelley. &quot;I&apos;m sitting in a pub garden for a mini festival and we&apos;ve just had a ska version of Merry Xmas Everybody. Odder than watching England struggle to threaten in England.Anyway, a fortnight ago, when you were doing Federer Djokovic, you kindly promoted a bike ride a mate of mine and me did to Paris. Heinous warnings were left on our Justgiving page (accurate ones, in their defence) but also money, and between your readership and Rob&apos;s we made over \u00a380, so thanks very much for promoting it. Your instruction to donate made a big difference.&quot; Ssshhh, I don&apos;t like to talk about my charity work.  104th over: South Africa 311-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 146, Kallis 27) Bresnan gives Kallis very little to work with, but doesn&apos;t threaten a wicket. Just three from the over, but South Africa are happy enough with that. &quot;According to the song, Hitler only had one ball,&quot; says Sean Kilgannon. &quot;Was it a googly?&quot;  103rd over: South Africa 308-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 144, Kallis 26) Swann&apos;s removed his glasses. He means business. But not much is happening now, the pace of the match slowing down. South Africa seem content to chip away at the target and keep England at arm&apos;s length.  102nd over: South Africa 306-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 143, Kallis 25) Look at this atrocity. It&apos;s basically The Karate Kid. But with skateboards.  101st over: South Africa 305-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 143, Kallis 24) Amla finds a gap at cover to pick up two more. We await the volcanic eruption from Broad. There are now pigeons on the pitch. Maybe they could have a bowl. &quot;Like (one imagines) many a stereotypical MBMer, I&apos;m combining following the action with arguing about the new Batman film elsewhere,&quot; says Ryan Dunne. &quot;Any chance you could start a Batman riff here to save me having to flick between browser windows? Discussing Batman might help with the whole impressing women thing too.&quot; Sure. Which film was better: 1995&apos;s Batman Forever or 1997&apos;s Batman and Robin?  100th over: South Africa 303-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 141, Kallis 24) A huge cry for lbw goes up from England as Swann hits Kallis&apos;s pads. But Swann stayed quiet, which suggests this isn&apos;t too convincing an appeal. The umpire remains unmoved. England discuss it and decide not to review and rightly so, because it was pitched outside the stumps. South Africa continue to grind on. Has anyone watched The Newsroom? Is it just me, or is Emily Mortimer excessively annoying?  99th over: South Africa 301-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 140, Kallis 23) Broad is shaking his head furiously. He&apos;s in a rare old funk, a ticking timebomb. Don&apos;t be surprised if you spot a mushroom cloud in The Oval area soon. This was a good over for England though, just one from it for South Africa. &quot;F5,&quot; says Sarah Barclay. I get that a lot from women.  98th over: South Africa 300-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 140, Kallis 22) England are getting nowhere here and Kallis makes mincemeat of Swann, swatting away to square leg for four. This isn&apos;t going to plan at all. A single from Kallis brings South Africa up to 300. England desperately need a wicket and it&apos;s hard to see one coming at the moment, Kallis and Amla pipe-and-slippers comfortable.  97th over: South Africa 295-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 140, Kallis 17) Broad is bouncing them down the crease in wild fashion; eventually one is given as a wide. &quot;Welcome Mr Steinberg \u2013 you&apos;ll find it all very easy,&quot; lies Ian Middleton. &quot;All you need to do is to vaguely comment on what the chaps on Sky TV are saying, paste in a few links from Cricinfo and voila! its done. Do you have children? From your photo you&apos;re a young fellow, and if you do have any little mites, you&apos;ll find its a short hop from lego and fingerpainting to them coming home with their girlfriends and spending three days upstairs, only occasionally coming down for to bellow for food. I put it down to bad parenting.&quot; Is it possible to have children when your main line of conversation is discussing the implications of Gareth Southgate&apos;s departure from the FA?  96th over: South Africa 292-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 138, Kallis 17) Kallis kneels down and tries to sweep one away to square leg, but gets his calculations all wrong, swiping and missing the ball, which flies past the stumps... and ends up being gloved away by Prior, gifting South Africa a fortunate run. Two more follow. The camera pans off to an ice cream van, prompting David Lloyd to break into a rendition of &quot;Just one cornetto...&quot;  95th over: South Africa 289-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 136, Kallis 17) A stat pops up on the screen showing there are four South African batsmen in the top 10 of the ICC rankings, ominously indicating the size of the task facing England. Broad has the face on after a bobbler from Kallis beats the outstretched arm of the plunging Anderson, running away for four. If looks could kill. &quot;Since we&apos;re going down this road, according to this article in the Daily Mail, Hitler&apos;s less than positive encounter with some cricket-playing English POWs during WWI is to blame for World War II,&quot; says Edmund King. Yes yes, but what was his batting average?  94th over: South Africa 284-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 135, Kallis 13) Oiiiiiiiiiiiii, shouts someone as Swann steps in to try to crack the South African resistance. Kallis has a big zesty swipe at his second delivery, picking up two runs to add to the total. And that&apos;s it for the over, the match taking on a rather sedate feel after tea. &quot;Were you never tempted to become a professional referee so that, when you blew the whistle and pointed to the spot, you could shout &apos;That&apos;s a Stone Hill penalty!&apos;?&quot; asks Ryan Dunne.  93rd over: South Africa 282-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 135, Kallis 11) It will be Stuart Broad to resume proceedings. A steely look in his eye, but Kallis doesn&apos;t look like he&apos;s about to budge any time soon. It&apos;s not long before Broad has his head in his hands as Kallis shuffles one away, before the redoubtable Amla edges behind for four. The pitch is so slow. &quot;In a reversal of Godwin&apos;s law, let&apos;s start a discussion about Hitler, by noting that Sam Leith&apos;s &apos;You talking&apos; to me?&apos; book about rhetoric has a chapter on both Churchill and Hitler,&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;It seems that when he was starting out as a speechmaker, Hitler did so as a &apos;guest&apos; of Clemens von Franckenstein in Munich. Maybe he really wasn&apos;t fully human after all. This has nothing to do with cricket; I&apos;m still working my way through the book and there are no cricket references at all so far. Disgusting.&quot; It&apos;s a little-known fact that Hitler was an excellent spin bowler.  I see Smyth spent much of the day indulgently discussing his own name. To whit, Steinberg means &apos;Stone Hill&apos; in German. People often call me Josh or Joseph, often a sign that they may have some sort of link to the Third Reich. Once I had a meeting with my headmaster who proceeded to call me Ben for half an hour. Despite my name being on the form he was looking at. I was too amused to correct him. He also once told my parents that one of my exam results was in the top three in the entire country. Turned out he was talking about a boy called Josh.  Afternoon. A dark day in the history of the Guardian here: they&apos;ve let me on to the cricket! And about time too. Expert analysis suggests that England&apos;s bowling men will need to chuck the cricketball ball past the South Africa batters and soon if this match isn&apos;t going to get away from them. Wickets. Go for the wickets.  TEA  92nd over: South Africa 277-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 131, Kallis 10) Bresnan strays onto the pads of Amla, who does the necessary to the fine-leg boundary. That&apos;s his 17th boundary. He is playing indecently well, and looks as fresh as he did when he started his innings 24 hours ago. What a player! He will be back after tea, because that&apos;s the end of the session, the fifth in a row that South Africa have dominated. England have plenty of work to do if they are to save this match. Jacob Steinberg will be with you for the extended evening session. Night.  91st over: South Africa 273-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 127, Kallis 10) It will be Swann to Kallis, with a short leg and slip. Kallis whips around his first delivery, which hits him on the pad outside the line of off stump, and gets off strike second ball. Bah.  90th over: South Africa 271-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 126, Kallis 9) A maiden from Bresnan to the unflappable Amla takes us closer to tea. Eight minutes to go. Will they give Swann an over at Kallis? &quot;Chris Woakes,&quot; says Tom Jenkins. &quot;2000 First Class runs at 34. Well over 200 wickets at 24. Why is Chris Woakes seemingly nowhere near Test consideration? That is not a rhetorical question \u2013 I&apos;d genuinely be interested to hear reasons for why.&quot; He&apos;s not as good as Anderson, Broad, Bresnan, Finn or Tremlett. I suppose it&apos;s that simple. In a different era he&apos;d probably have played by now.  89th over: South Africa 271-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 126, Kallis 9) Kallis, forcing off the back foot, snicks Anderson short and just wide of second slip for four. &quot;I think DRS is fine how it is,&quot; writes Al Halton. &quot;That review only played into South Africa&apos;s hands \u2013 it revealed England&apos;s desperation and reduced them to one review. I think two reviews is the right number - the second one is insurance against something bizarre happening, and if you use it speculatively you forfeit that insurance.&quot; I agree about the number of reviews. It still feels like something needs to change with DRS, maybe how much of the ball needs to be hitting the stumps for it to be out.  88th over: South Africa 264-2 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Amla 124, Kallis 4) The new batsman is Jacques Kallis, who has a surprisingly poor record in England. He gets off the mark with a flick to fine leg for four. This isn&apos;t exactly a bang-bang pitch. England might be tempted to get Graeme Swann on here. &quot;We&apos;re into the all-rounders...&quot; says Simon Dean.  WICKET! South Africa 260-2 (Smith b Bresnan 131) Tim Bresnan strikes with the first ball of a new spell! It was a fortunate dismissal but England will not give a solitary one about that. Smith, not fully forward, inside edged a defensive push onto his leg and back onto the stumps. He gets a deserved standing ovation for a mighty, tone-setting performance: 131 from 273 balls and a partnership of 259 with Hashim Amla.  87th over: South Africa 260-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 131, Amla 124) This is now South Africa&apos;s highest second wicket partnership against England ever, ever.  86th over: South Africa 256-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 129, Amla 122) If England don&apos;t break through in the half hour before tea, they will only have a draw left to play for. As well as South Africa have batted, at some stage they need to slip a gear to give their bowlers enough time to win the match. They have batted too slowly when on top a few times against England, most notably the second Test of 1995-96, the third Test of 1998, the second Test of 1999-2000 and the fifth Test of 2004-05. I wouldn&apos;t criticise Smith and Amla for that at this stage \u2013\u00a0they have been magnificent \u2013 and I&apos;m sure they will try to up the rate if they are still there after tea. &quot;How about if there is only one review allowed per team,&quot; says Vinod Raghavan, &quot;but you do not lose it if it turns out to be an &apos;umpires call&apos;s decision?&quot; That would not resolve the problem of caught behinds that don&apos;t show on Hotspot, though. Also, I&apos;m not sure about this idea that you shouldn&apos;t lose a review if it&apos;s &apos;umpire&apos;s call&apos;, because captains will feel a lot more comfortable with speculative reviews and that would mean umpteen delays. It would also take us further away from the original DRS brief, which was to eradicate howlers.  85th over: South Africa 252-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 127, Amla 120) Amla spoons an airy drivejust wide of Anderson, stretching to his right in his follow through. The ball races away for four to bring up a magnificent 250 partnership. That new-ball optimism lasted a long time. Smith&apos;s average score when he has made a Test century in England is now 307. He&apos;s not quite top of the list. Allan Border&apos;s average was 771.  84th over: South Africa 247-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 126, Amla 116) Smith steers consecutive deliveries from Broad to the third-man boundary, and he makes it three fours on a row with a flick off the pads. Broad has got the face on now. Look at his coupon! Alright, you can&apos;t, you&apos;re reading a text-based commentary, but just look at his coupon!  &quot;England could really do with a 90mph bowler to throw down a few bouncers and yorkers as fast as possible to unsettle those two out there,&quot; says Alex Bishop. &quot;When its not swinging Broad &amp; Anderson&apos;s 80mph bowling is no threat.&quot; They are high 80s aren&apos;t they? I still don&apos;t think England have done that much wrong today. (NB: OBO reporter reserves the right to demand they all be sacked, ostracised and cattle-prodded should South Africa reach 700 for one.)  83rd over: South Africa 234-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 113, Amla 116) Anderson is pitching the ball up, trying to get some swing, and that allows Amla to play another imperious cover-drive for four.  82nd over: South Africa 229-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 112, Amla 112) Stuart Broad strays onto the pads of Hashim Amla. This means only one thing: four runs. It&apos;s been a while, but this situation demands only one hyperlink.  81st over: South Africa 225-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 112, Amla 108) Right. It&apos;s time for business. Jimmy Anderson has a bright, shiny new ball in his hand. That&apos;s the good news. The bad news is that Graeme Smith&apos;s average score in England when he reaches a century is 303. Not much happens in Anderson&apos;s opening over; a hint of swing maybe, but that&apos;s all. &quot;Weren&apos;t we reintroduced to this feeling of inadequacy in one of the Tests against the Aussies recently?&quot; says Ian Copestake. &quot;Only for it all to turn out very right in the end. Consider that to be my pep talk for struggling OBO followers.&quot; Yes, Haddin and Hussey added 300+ at Brisbane, although England did go past the edge about 70 times in that partnership, as compared to about two in this one. South Africa should get at least 500 here, although there&apos;s no reason why England can&apos;t save the match. A lot will depend on how Imran Tahir copes with the pressure of being the designated matchwinner on a turning pitch. Some spinners thrive on it; others can&apos;t handle it.  80th over: South Africa 223-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 111, Amla 107) Time for drinks, and the second new ball.  79th over: South Africa 222-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 110, Amla 107) Kevin Pietersen is going to bowl just a single over with the old ball. He&apos;s a touch too short and milked for four singles. &quot;222 for one,&quot; says Gary Naylor, &quot;and two words swim up in my mind&apos;s eye \u2013 Jacques Kallis.&quot; Two slightly shorter words are coming to my mind as well.  78th over: South Africa 218-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 108, Amla 105) South Africa picked up Kevin Pietersen during the last over with the old ball, and England would sacrifice at least four toenails for a similar breakthrough to expose Kallis to the new ball. Nothing doing in that Bresnan over, although it was a good one. &quot;What&apos;s harder than hard yakka?&quot; says Niall Mullen. &quot;Because it&apos;s pretty hard yakka just reading the OBO. Wicket please!&quot;  77th over: South Africa 217-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 108, Amla 104) Smith survives a big LBW shout from Swann. I think he was outside the line and Alastair Cook (Strauss is off the field) does not play fast and loose with England&apos;s final review. Hawkeye shows he was miles outside the line. &quot;That review against Smith shows what&apos;s wrong with the current DRS set-up,&quot; says Robert Speed. &quot;England didn&apos;t really think they got him - they&apos;re just desperate for a wicket and willing to burn their first review in hope. There should only be one incorrect review allowed per team per innings. That way, teams (including batsmen) will know only to use it when they know the umpire has made a howler. That&apos;s what DRS was originally meant for. Not the marginal stuff.&quot; I agree that DRS has clearly moved away from its original purpose to eradicate howlers, and that is not a good thing, but having only one review is too big a risk I think. We&apos;ve seen a few examples (Laxman last year was one, I think; Bell in Australia another) where a batsman survived a caught-behind review even though instinct said he was out. It would be pretty harsh if the bowling team were lose their only review for something that was actually out.  76th over: South Africa 217-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 108, Amla 104) Bresnan and Swann have managed to slow the scoring down a touch, with five runs from the last four overs. Four more until the second new ball is available. &quot;This is fantastic stuff,&quot; says Guy Hornsby. &quot;Finally, after all this No.1 lark had just about started to sink in, we&apos;re being given a proper lesson. That warm cloak of grinding inferiority is keeping me warm once again. Of course, there&apos;s little between the teams, but at the moment, that &apos;little&apos; is Dale Steyn. And while we have artists, we don&apos;t have a destroyer. Long way to go though.&quot; Nothing to worry about. South Africa have played wonderfully but from this position you would expect England to save this Test more often than not.  75th over: South Africa 215-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 108, Amla 103) &quot;Please help a message get on the OBO?&quot; writes AB. &quot;It&apos;s got to the point I wait for each over to see if my name&apos;s in lights and not the score update which means even the obdurate, enduring values of Test cricket couldn&apos;t stop my spiraling into the vortex of hope/rejection.&quot; God bless the internet.  74th over: South Africa 214-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 108, Amla 102) Tim Bresnan replaces Jimmy Anderson. As the chaps have just said on Sky, this doesn&apos;t happen often to this England attack. These are the highest partnerships against England since David Saker became bowling coach and took the attack to another level. Bresnan has a big shout for LBW against Smith turned down by Asad Rauf. There were two issues, height and where it pitched. I wouldn&apos;t review this \u2013 but England are desperate so Andrew Strauss does go for the review. In fact there was another consideration Hotspot shows a slight inside edge, so everything else is irrelevant. For the record, it did pitch well outside leg. That was a poor review, born of desperation.  73rd over: South Africa 213-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 108, Amla 101) Dear Jim, please could you fix it for England to take a wicket some time before the millennium. Thanks.  72nd over: South Africa 212-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 108, Amla 100) I&apos;d give Pietersen a couple of overs here. It&apos;s turning, and you never know what impact the sight of KP might have on Smith&apos;s concentration. Probably none, but it&apos;s worth a try. Amla half steers, half edges Anderson wide of slip for four to move to 99, and a single to third man takes him to through a beautiful hundred from 199 balls, a serene and graceful innings. He&apos;s an awesome player. Smith isn&apos;t the worst either, and he flicks Anderson off the pads for four to complete an expensive over. England are starting to get a bit grumpy.  71st over: South Africa 203-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 104, Amla 95) &quot;Headingley 1981,&quot; says Richard O&apos;Hagan. &quot;I didn&apos;t see the end of the game, because I was at school. However, I do remember our deputy headmaster, the wonderfully named Mr Mann, calling the school into a special assembly to tell us the result. Incidentally, I grew up in Warwickshire so Geoff Humpage was a favourite player\u2013 but not as much as his understudy, Geoff Tedstone, was was the son of the cricket master at my primary school.&quot; Warwickshire. Effing goddamn motherfracking Warwickshire.  70th over: South Africa 202-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 104, Amla 94) Two from Anderson&apos;s over. &quot;Dubai and Bangkok \u2013 meh,&quot; writes Tom Carver. &quot;Try getting a decent live stream-Internet-thing in Guangzhou. Trying to watch cricket here is possibly the most frustrating way to pass an evening.&quot;  69th over: South Africa 200-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 103, Amla 93) &quot;Wow what a shot!&quot; says Shane Warne as Amla flicks Swann wristily through midwicket for four. A fine sweep for four two balls later takes him into the nineties and South Africa to 200. Someone is in trouble, something bad is happening. &quot;Konichiwa Rob,&quot; says Phil Podolsky. &quot;Japanese a &apos;low-status language&apos;? In what alternative universe? It&apos;s like the ultimate in kewlness, always been. I was derided as being a lamestreamer for sticking to the Indo-European languages in my BA. Try telling a bunch of snooty Egyptologists you&apos;re into Old English.&quot;  68th over: South Africa 192-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 103, Amla 85) &quot;Ed Milliband has just been on TMS and said that Geoff was his childhood hero,&quot; says John Leavey. Geoff Humpage? &quot;But that&apos;s not my beef. He claimed to have watched Headingley 1981 while bunking off from a family event. Shouldn&apos;t he have been bunking off from school? Pretty sure I watched the end at school. To wimpy to bunk off, obviously. Or is my memory effed?&quot; Well I was only a bairn so I&apos;m not sure, but the last day was Tuesday July 21 so it could have been either. It may not necessarily be a Jackie Milburn moment.  67th over: South Africa 191-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 103, Amla 84) It&apos;s Swann to Smith, a compelling battle of skill and will, craft and graft, and two almighty jaws. A nice flighted delivery turns past the edge and all the way into the hands of Anderson at slip, reinforcing Shane Warne&apos;s point that maybe Swann should bowl a touch slower. &quot;I got one of those hop-on, hop-off bus tickets when I was travelling in Australia many years ago, booked by phone,&quot; says Mark Jelbert. &quot;For 3 months when getting on each bus I had to show a ticket proclaiming me Mark Jailbait. I have a feeling they did it on purpose.&quot;  66th over: South Africa 191-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 103, Amla 84) Here come Smith and Amla again. They have been together for 64 overs yet there will be no sense that their work is done. Theirs is to win, if it kills them. Jimmy Anderson will start the session, a shortish spell before he gets ready for the second new ball. He starts well wide of off stump to Amla with a 7/2 field, so clearly the plan is for them to be boring dry until the new ball is available. That&apos;s the plan, anyway, but the latest reverse swings onto the pads and is clipped easily for four by Amla. &quot;My name is Tom Bowtell,&quot; writes Tom Bowtell. &quot;Fairly straightforward one might think. Yet when I got a school cricket certificate from former Hampshire batsman Rupert Cox it was made out to Toni Bowel.&quot;  LUNCH  65th over: South Africa 187-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 103, Amla 80) Smith fiddles Bresnan to third-man boundary for four to move to 99 with two balls of the session remaining. And there it is! He back cuts the next ball for four to reach an outstanding century in his 100th Test. It&apos;s been yet another wonderful triumph of his granite will, particularly earlier in the session when he was really struggling against Swann. He took 160 balls to get his first 50 and just 41 to get the second. Smith walks off at lunch with his arm round Amla&apos;s shoulder and a proud grin on his face. Quite right too. South Africa have had an unbelievable morning \u2013 not just the fact they scored 101 without losing a wicket but the soul-crushing certainty with which they scored them. They look well set for a huge total. See you in half an hour for the afternoon session.  64th over: South Africa 178-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 95, Amla 79) Swann moves across the stumps to muscle Swann through midwicket for four more, another superb stroke. Only one of his 35 runs off Swann have come on the off side. &quot;I don&apos;t know why they&apos;re complaining,&quot; says Chloe Lin. &quot;No-one can get Chinese names right \u2013 there are six tones in Cantonese, which you have to sing rather than speak. Irish is perceived as a low-status language\u2013- like Dutch and Japanese. That is, few people think it matters how you pronounce it. Imagine talking about paintings by Monnit and Mannit \u2013 you&apos;d get a superior smile, because French is a high-status language. Yet we hear Van Goff all the time. I once heard an Englishman on TV pronounce Kaori \u2013 she was in the studio with him \u2013 as &apos;Kay-ore-rye&apos;. That&apos;s bizarre. As for poor Martin Skirtle \u2013 no doubt he&apos;s got used to it.&quot;  63rd over: South Africa 172-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 90, Amla 78) Amla back cuts a poor delivery from Bresnan for four. South Africa have paced this session brilliantly, taking 29 from the first 15 overs and 57 from 11 since then. &quot;Jimmy Tyldesley (46th over) may beat me on the location, but didn&apos;t he get the memo from John Starbuck?&quot; says Jennifer Hegarty. &quot;He could at least have expressed gratitude to you, Snuth darling. And using the Irish excuse for your y is weak \u2013 Irish names are much harder to spell than that. I&apos;ve given up trying to get n\u00ed h\u00c9igeartaigh into usage and reluctantly anglicised myself.&quot;  62nd over: South Africa 166-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 89, Amla 73) Swann beats Smith with an unbelievable delivery: full, curving in and then turning viciously past the edge.  &quot;You are boring,&quot; writes Andries van der Walt. &quot;Why don&apos;t you commentate on the cricket rather than waste time and space on how names are spelt?&quot; Congratulations on your appointment as Guardian Sports Editor, Andries.  61st over: South Africa 164-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 87, Amla 73) Tim Bresnan finally comes into the attack with 18 minutes to go to lunch. The possible logic, suggested by Nasser Hussain, is that England wanted to wait just a bit longer to give the ball more chance to reverse. Smith tucks another single off the hip. He is 13 away from scoring a hundred in his 100th Test. A few others have done it \u2013 Ricky Ponting scored two, against Smith&apos;s South Africa \u2013 but it would still be a stunning achievement. &quot;Saturday Story turns today,&quot; writes Paul King, the executive producer of Sky&apos;s brilliant cricket coverage. &quot;Look at the history of &apos;overseas&apos; players to play for England from Ranji to Trott \u2013 worth a watch if you&apos;re not out &apos;refueling&apos; at lunch.&quot; It is indeed; the trailer this morning looked excellent. I might send a flunky to Pret so I can watch it.  60th over: South Africa 162-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 86, Amla 72) Swann is back on, having changed ends. A quiet over brings a couple of singles. England haven&apos;t done too much wrong this morning, in truth. They are just bowling to two very good batsmen on a flat deck. &quot;Interesting Sean Clayton&apos;s issue with not enough people having seen James Bond by Sean Connery,&quot; says Storm Ferguson. &quot;Living in South Africa I&apos;ve long accepted being called Stum, but the best ever was being addressed as Dawn. A trifle off-putting to a bass voiced male but hysterically funny to my daughter, so Sean should easily be able to live with Seen. Oh, and its great seeing your vaunted attack suffering a tad.&quot;  59th over: South Africa 160-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 85, Amla 71) These are Graeme Smith&apos;s Test scores in England. Once he gets in ... &quot;Afternoon, handsome,&quot; writes  Miss Maway Simon  Richard O&apos;Hagan. &quot;You can imagine the number of times I have my surname mispronounced, let alone incorrectly spelled. Which is understandable, given that even I think it is a bit odd. But my wife used to suffer all sorts of mis-spellings of her maiden name which, given that it was Garden, gives me little hope for humanity.&quot;  58th over: South Africa 158-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 84, Amla 70) &quot;Afternoon Rob, another couple of people relying on your OBO here in Dubrovnik,&quot; says Ralph Waumsley. &quot;Waiting in an Irish pub for some Aussies to finish watching some domestic rugby union before we overpower everyone and put the cricket on. Highlight of the day so far: Middle aged lady in a head scarf walks in with companion who looks like a fat version of The Dude from The Big Lebowski. She takes three steps in, takes a look around and then emits a disdainful &apos;Doesn&apos;t look very Irish to me&apos; in a thick Lancastrian accent. The Dude grunts and they make a swift exit.&quot; So just to clarify: you&apos;re waiting to watch cricket in an Irish pub in Dubrovnik and The Dude is courting Daphne from Frasier&apos;s Mum? God bless the internet.  57th over: South Africa 155-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 83, Amla 68) Bopara comes on for Swann, ahead of Tim Bresnan, who has only bowled six of the 57 overs in this innings. Smith throws the bat at a very wide delivery, edging it in the air but wide of backward point for another boundary. Nowt dry about this min-session. England are hemorrhaging runs just now; 40 in the last five overs. &quot;Discussing the pronunciation of Sean as &apos;seen&apos;,&quot; says Kieran Walsh. &quot;I think it is fine for the poster to have pronounced as &apos;shawn&apos; but the eponymous hero from the South Yorkshire rifles really should decide whether it is SeenBean or Shawn Bourne. He can&apos;t have both it both ways.&quot;  56th over: South Africa 150-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 79, Amla 67) Four more to Smith, flipped through square leg off Broad. He is motoring, although he is fortunate when another whip flies in the air between the two men at short forward square leg and short midwicket. It scoots away for four more. Smith reached his fifty from 160 deliveries; since then he has scored 28 from 16. &quot;Am I the only person sanding a floor whilst following OBO today?&quot; asks Matt Delargy. I suspect you&apos;re the only one following the OBO while doing so, although coincidentally I&apos;m sanding the Guardian floor while writing it. We&apos;re encouraged to multitask these days.  55th over: South Africa 141-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 71, Amla 66) Ten from Swann&apos;s over. That means he has conceded 21 from his last two overs, having conceded 21 from 16 before that. Smith is playing him with much more confidence now. He walks down the track to work the second ball wide of midwicket for four, a very good stroke, and a similar stroke brings two more later in the over. The next ball is tickled fine for another boundary and suddenly Smith, who was stuck in the forties for ages this morning, has zoomed into the seventies. On Sky, Shane Warne says he would like Swann to bowl slightly slower and slightly wider to Smith. &quot;My parents (obviously) thought it would be hilarious to spell my name with two S&apos;s, ensuring that my name would be hissed rather than spoken for the rest of my life,&quot; says Ssagala. &quot;My precious 5-year old niece once asked me if the extra S stood for &quot;Superman&quot;. My ego wouldn&apos;t let me deny it.&quot;  54th over: South Africa 131-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 61, Amla 66) Broad goes around the wicket to Smith, who drives his first ball emphatically through extra cover for four. England&apos;s yakka is getting harder by the over. &quot;Almost everyone back home in Oz finds my name impossible to pronounce from its written form \u2013 the worst teacher effort was &apos;Ermanon&apos;,&quot; says Eamonn Maloney. &quot;Predictive text&apos;s guess is Ergonom, but that at least has the excuse of not being human.  53rd over: South Africa 126-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 56, Amla 66) Smith works Swann through square leg for three to reach a defiant, tone-setting fifty from 160 balls. It&apos;s the slowest of his Test career, and one of the more important. He will want plenty more than fifty, and he knows how to get them in this country. Only Don Bradman averages more in Tests in England. He hammers a sweep behind square for four two balls later. Eleven from the over. &quot;When people say to me, &apos;Are you sure?&apos; I like to reply, &apos;Yes, I am: Kieron Shaw&apos;,&quot; says Kieron Shaw. &quot;It was hilarious when I was 9 years old. I assumed I would eventually grow out of it. I still haven&apos;t grown out of it. I don&apos;t think I will ever grow out of it. It&apos;s just too irresistible when somebody tosses up the opportunity... It tends to go down badly on dates, though, I&apos;ve noticed. It&apos;s not just that it suggests to husband-and-father-material hunters a manifest lack of the required gravitas. It doesn&apos;t even get the more liberated types into bed for a quick session of the old whistle-and-pop. So nobody wins. Not me; not women; certainly not comedy. In retrospect, actually, maybe the women are winning in this situation.&quot;  52nd over: South Africa 115-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 48, Amla 63) Amla eases another gorgeous drive to the extra-cover boundary, this time off the front foot. It&apos;s not banterlicious fate-tempting to say he looks nailed on for a century. He is playing with formidable class and certainty. &quot;I&apos;m still amazed at my advanced age at the number of people who think that &apos;Sean&apos; is pronounced &apos;seen&apos;,&quot; says Sean Kilgannon. &quot;Have they never heard of James Bond?&quot;  51st over: South Africa 111-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 48, Amla 59) Swann beats Smith with a wonderful delivery that dips onto off stump and then turns sharply. The next ball, fairly short, prompts an ugly, panicky sweep at fresh air from Smith. This is a brilliant contest. Smith is surviving on sheer will. He has 48 from 159 balls now. &quot;No one ever mispronounces &apos;Tony&apos; or &apos;pony&apos; or &apos;sony&apos;, but my name is constantly pronounced Donnay, Downey, Dooney and (once) Dong,&quot; says Matt Dony. &quot;When I explained to someone on the phone &apos;Like pony, but with a D&apos;, I got a letter to Mr Ponyd.&quot;  50th over: South Africa 110-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 48, Amla 58) Stuart Broad replaces Jimmy Anderson, who bowled an excellent spell of 6-2-11-0. Amla drives pleasantly through the covers for a couple. He is, in his own quiet way, playing an outstanding innings. He gets a single off the penultimate ball, a rotation of the strike that will irk Swann at the other end. &quot;Morning, Snuth,&quot; says Sean Clayton. &quot;If it&apos;s on Wikipedia, it must be true. &quot;Likewise, the replacement of the &quot;i&quot; with a &quot;y&quot; in &quot;Smyth&quot; or &quot;Smythe&quot; is also often considered an affectation but may have originally occurred because of the difficulty of reading blackletter text, where &quot;Smith&quot; might look like &quot;Snuth&quot; or &quot;Simth&quot; &quot;.  49th over: South Africa 107-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 48, Amla 55) Did anyone see Bumble and the Inspiral Carpets on Cricket AM this morning? How was it? Smith crunches Swann towards midwicket, where Trott does really well to stop the ball and keep Smith on strike. Smith gets in a bit of a mess with the last delivery and survives a biggish LBW shout. It was too high. That&apos;s an excellent maiden over. &quot;This is top-class Test cricket,&quot; says Mike Atherton on Sky. Damn straight.  48th over: South Africa 107-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 48, Amla 55) A maiden from the accurate Anderson to Amla. We&apos;ve had 21 runs from 11 overs this morning; England will be pleased with their control of the run-rate, if not the apparent immovability of Smith and particularly Amla. &quot;My sympathies Rob,&quot; says Jan Wessels. &quot;I was Djan Weasels to the never-heard-of-Keplers during my stay in the UK.&quot;  47th over: South Africa 107-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 48, Amla 55) Smith survives a huge shout for LBW from a Swann slider. It was close but it was only just kissing the leg stump so England were right not to review. England need to give Swann a few others at Smith, who is playing him nowhere near as comfortably as Amla. &quot;I can&apos;t see how Smyth can be Irish since there&apos;s no y in their alphabet,&quot; says John Orford. &quot;Your name would be Mac a&apos;Ghobhainn, son of a smith, and probably rendered as McGowan or McGovern. There&apos;s no hope Rob, you&apos;re a crusty Tory, unfit for such as read the Guadrian.&quot; Outed before midday. Dumb luck.  46th over: South Africa 106-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 48, Amla 54) &quot;I see your Abu Dhabi and raise you Bangkok train station sat with upwards of 10 Buddhist monks in a coffee shop,&quot; says Jimmy Tyldesley. &quot;Hoping for a wicket and a reliable sleeper train down to Phuket. Either, or.&quot;  45th over: South Africa 104-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 46, Amla 54) Amla misses a couple of sweeps at Swann, the second of which deflects away for two leg byes. He is getting a long way across to Swann so is invariably outside off stump at the point of contact if the ball does hit the pad. Another delivery keeps low towards the end of the over; that&apos;s becoming a recurring theme. This is excellent stuff, an unyielding arm-wrestle of a session. &quot;Come now Rob, surely your surname isn&apos;t all bad?&quot; says Ryan Dunne, whose surname is hopefully never mispronounced. &quot;If it was me, I&apos;d have been tempted to be very selfish at team sports, so, when the scary PE teacher said &apos;there&apos;s no my in Smyth!!&apos; one could respond &apos;Er, actually sir, I&apos;ll think you&apos;ll find there is&apos;.&quot;  44th over: South Africa 102-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 46, Amla 54) A couple of people below the line on Mike Selvey&apos;s match report are disputing that Anderson is the best swing bowler in the world. Is there really any dispute? Steyn is the best fast bowler in the world, and the best bowler in the world. He has a superb outswinger, but Anderson&apos;s control of swing is peerless. Isn&apos;t it? Anyway, Smith back cuts Anderson for four to bring up the hundred partnership, the ninth between this pair in Tests. I suppose for South Africa the plan is to reach 550 or so around lunchtime tomorrow, and then ask England to bat four and a bit sessions on a wearing pitch.  43rd over: South Africa 98-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 42, Amla 54) Smith muscles Swann through midwicket for four. England have started pretty well but they have very little to work with. &quot;Might be a long day,&quot; says Gary Naylor.  42nd over: South Africa 93-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 37, Amla 54) Amla gets the first boundary of the day with a divine back-foot drive off Anderson. There will be few better shots all day. &quot;I&apos;m currently trying to find some way of watching it live from Abu Dhabi, but failing, so am relying on your relay of events \u2013 so don&apos;t worry, your existence is more than justified to me!&quot; says Jennifer Hegarty. One down, the rest of humanity to go.  41st over: South Africa 89-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 37, Amla 50) There is plenty of turn for Swann. It&apos;s fairly slow but still more pronounced than you would expect in the seventh session of the match. Swann has started really well and is, deliberately or otherwise, varying the amount of turn from ball to ball. Amla pats a single to reach a serene, classy half-century from 110 balls. He really is a wonderful player. Smith, who is looking a little jittery, inside edges the last ball of the over not far wide of Cook at short leg. &quot;Hello Dear,&quot; says John Starbuck. &quot;You can tell this is an OBO reader&apos;s message because it slavishly copies and builds on a previous one. We love nothing so much as a riff that everyone can join in with, so expect phishing emails of all type nice throughout the day.&quot;  40th over: South Africa 88-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 37, Amla 49) Amla works Anderson off his hip for a single. Anderson won&apos;t mind that, as it means he gets three balls at Graeme Smith. The first of those, again wide of off stump, beats a crooked defensive poke. England&apos;s seamers are going to bowl dry today. There&apos;s a bit of uneven bounce as well, which will become more pronounced as the game progresses and will interest Broad and Morkel in particular. &quot;Rob, why is your Smith spelt with a y?&quot; says Jan Wessels. &quot;Scared and confused from South Africa.&quot; I assume it&apos;s an Irish thing, although Barry Glendenning reckons it&apos;s a posh surname. Which is rich coming from Lord Glendenning. It&apos;s pronounced with a Y rather than Smith, although of course not everyone realises that, which led to much hilarity and self-loathing at school. This is fun.  39th over: South Africa 87-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 37, Amla 48) As expected, Graeme Swann opens the bowling at the Dingy Boozer End. He has a slip and short leg for Amla, and the second ball brings an optimistic shout for LBW when Amla offers no stroke. The ball turned sharply but nowhere near enough to have hit the stumps. &quot;The quality of Guardian Soulmates is slipping...&quot; says Matt Dony. &quot;Maybe Fiver readers have a chance, after all.&quot;  38th over: South Africa 86-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 37, Amla 47) It is a beautiful day at The Oval. Nasser Hussain and Sir Ian Botham concur that it feels like a batting day. There will be 98 overs today, to make up some time from yesterday. Jimmy Anderson, having demonstratively addressed the England huddle, will open the bowling. He starts by angling all six deliveries across Smith, one of which beats a nervous defensive push. It&apos;s a maiden. England bowled pretty straight to Smith yesterday, but now it seems they are, as Nasser puts it on Sky, keen to &quot;take the leg side out of the game&quot;. Smith has scored only three of his 37 runs on the off side in this innings. That approach could make for a fascinating game of patience because Smith has the will and concentration to bat for long periods.  The first email of the day comes from Maway Simon. &quot;Hello Dear. my name is miss maway simon, i saw your profile during my searching for soul mate i became interested to make friend with you.Some friends are remembered because of their smile.Some friends are remembered because of their style.But you are remembered because you are so nice to remember.please i will like to know more about you.&quot; Right, I&apos;m off to live happily ever after. Bye!  Preamble &quot;Someone is in trouble, something bad is happening.&quot; It may be a bit early to come over all Mulholland Drive about England&apos;s position in this Test, yet there is a burgeoning sense that a match which was theirs to mould 24 hours ago may now be morphing into something unexpected. South Africa will resume on 86 for one, a deficit of 299. If they bat as they did yesterday, when the defence of Graeme Smith and Hashim Amla made water seem loose by comparison, England will have a long, hard day in the field.  Much will depend on Graeme Swann, who has already got a couple of balls to rag, and of course whether the ball swings. (Possibly not; it&apos;s a lovely day in south London.) There is certainly no reason for England to panic. Today should be a compelling struggle for supremacy between the two best teams in the world. By 7pm tonight, there&apos;s every chance only one team will have realistic hopes of winning the match. This, you don&apos;t need me to tell you but I&apos;m going to anyway because I&apos;m trying to justify my goddamn existence here, is a huge day.", "publicationDate": "2012-07-21T17:55:00Z", "tags": ["South Africa in England 2012", "England cricket team", "South Africa cricket team", "Cricket", "Over by over reports", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/21/south-africa-in-england-2012-england-cricket-team", "title": "England v South Africa - as it happened | Rob Smyth and Jacob Steinberg", "sentences": ["&quot;Dubai and Bangkok \u2013 meh,&quot; writes Tom Carver.", "46th over: South Africa 106-1 (in reply to England&apos;s 385; Smith 48, Amla 54) &quot;I see your Abu Dhabi and raise you Bangkok train station sat with upwards of 10 Buddhist monks in a coffee shop,&quot; says Jimmy Tyldesley."]}, {"article": "ArcheryAthleticsBadmintonBasketballBoxingCanoeingCyclingDivingEquestrianFencingFootballGymnasticsHandballHockeyJudo Archery     2012 network: archery nick kale    Nick Kale is a USA Archery Resident Athlete at the United States Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, California.

He worked for the National Basketball Association public relations department through the 2008 Olympics, and the experience stoked a passion for FIBA hoops. The passion for PR was quite abating, if it ever existed at all. So he quit his job, and devoted his full time to making a public spectacle of his basketball obsession. So far, the decision has paid off emotionally and monetarily, but mostly because his standards are so low for both thresholds. Strauss has written for ESPN.com, Salon.com, The Classical, Dime Magazine, Free Darko. He&apos;s quite thrilled at the prospect of speaking to a broader international audience, because &quot;&quot;basketball as a unifying force&quot;&quot; is the kind of touching trope that wrings water from his oft-rolled eyes. He&apos;s rooting for the United States in theory, but his intellectual vanity is hoping that Spain shows them up.

Chatting to Boris Johnson briefly, I mentioned an extremely well-known member of the cabinet. He gave me a very Borisovian gurn, to indicate disapproval, even contempt. But there&apos;s nothing to write down, so it can&apos;t be used, or proved if it were challenged. David Cameron held his annual summer party for the hacks this week, and we asked if he was going to any Olympic events. &quot;I might have to go to [an event] with [one particular world leader].&quot; Again, the look of dislike was perfectly obvious but impossible to record \u2013 probably vital in the new Twitter world, where nothing is ever spoken in private. \u2712The last word, I think, on Ken Dodd. Last week I mentioned the fact that the story \u2013 chap visits another chap and remarks on a picture of Ken Dodd on his desk, which turns out to be the second chap&apos;s wife \u2013 had actually happened to Prof Bill Jones of Liverpool. Guido Casale writes and says that he heard the same tale about 40 years ago, though not about Prof Jones. He thinks it&apos;s an urban legend, like the granny on the roof rack. The widow of Prof Jones&apos;s colleague says she has no recollection of the event \u2013 though I&apos;m not surprised: what loving husband would tell their wife she&apos;d been mistaken for Ken Dodd? My theory is that there are two types of urban myth. There are those that never happened and could never happen, such as the vanishing hitchhiker (man gives a lift to young woman and delivers her home. Next day he finds her pullover. So he takes it back to the house, where her parents tell him that their daughter was killed by a car, a year ago, at the spot where he picked her up). Then there are those that might well have occurred. The story is good enough to be passed around, but it changes every time, so entirely different versions are being told in Penzance and Thurso. When I worked on a book about paranormal beliefs, I often found it helpful to strip stories down to their essentials. &quot;Man mistakes picture of middle-aged woman for middle-aged man&quot; is not particularly surprising. Likewise this: the other day I was waiting at the bus stop outside the care home where my parents live. There was a man there who looked similar to my old colleague Rupert Cornwell (he&apos;s the half-brother of John le Carr\u00e9), whom I&apos;d known in parliament and in the US, where he lives with his American wife. I did a sort of &quot;that bloke looks awfully like Rupert&quot; puzzled frown, and could see him thinking: &quot;He looks just like Simon Hoggart, only with less hair.&quot; Of course it was him, and we were astounded by the coincidence. Arthur Koestler would have been thrilled beyond reason. But say: &quot;Two men from the London area have elderly parents in the same London care home,&quot; and it isn&apos;t startling at all. \u2712We went to see &quot;the&quot; Olympic torch \u2013 one of hundreds \u2013 go through our local streets this week. It was a festival of sponsorship. First there was an eccentric chap on a bike, decorated like a Heath Robinson contraption, followed by five police motorbikes, possibly in case a terrorist in the five-deep crowd decided that the whimsical machine offended their religion. Then the buses: Coca-Cola, Lloyds Bank and Samsung, the last filled with gyrating women as if in a Bangkok bar. Dozens more policemen, ambulances, and random cyclists, then near the end a little girl running with the torch, and looking tired out, poor thing. Given that the biggest sponsors of all have been the British taxpayers, I waited for our sponsorship bus, filled with nubile dancing lovelies, but in vain. And if Coca-Cola can ban Pepsi and Visa can bar MasterCard, presumably we might stop foreigners from buying tickets. But I gather it doesn&apos;t work like that. \u2712Hungry and in a hurry, I went into a McDonalds, a multimillion- pound Olympic sponsor, for the first time in many years this week. I had a cheeseburger with fries. The fries were quite nice, as I remembered. But the cheeseburger was, simply, vile. A slimy patty of rendered meat substance topped with a slimy, lurid orange covering of processed dairy-style product. And the bun tasted like mashed up Kleenex. It made even Burger King and KFC seem like a gourmet experience. Still, I know now \u2013 never again. \u2712We bought a car this week, a second-hand Skoda. The brand used to be a joke but now tops most of those tables for owner-satisfaction and so on. If they get rid of the horrible badge, apparently showing a cockerel being strangled, we could even flaunt it. We went to two showrooms. At one a shy and diffident chap helped us, and willingly admitted the car&apos;s faults and omissions. At the other we had the used car dealer that tradition demands, all hustle and shove. Naturally we went with the first. I had hoped we could go for a top-of-the-line Skoda, the wonderfully named Superb. I wanted to say things like &quot;I&apos;ll just run you to the station, in the Superb,&quot; or &quot;It&apos;s a two-hour trip, but only an hour forty in our Superb,&quot; or even, &quot;I&apos;ll have James bring the Superb round to the front portico.&quot; But it&apos;s too big for our garage space. \u2712I&apos;ve been reading an excellent book by Piers Brendon, Eminent Elizabethans, which, unlike the BBC&apos;s weird choices, focuses on just four people: Murdoch, Thatcher, Prince Charles and Mick Jagger. By bringing a real historian&apos;s discipline to the task, Brendon has unearthed lots of new material, including the first logged double entendre by Margaret &quot;Will this gun jerk me off?&quot; Thatcher. In 1961, with a minor government job, she devoured all the raw data she could find, and brought the House down with her line, &quot;And I have the latest red-hot figure!&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-07-27T20:03:01Z", "tags": ["Boris Johnson", "Politics", "David Cameron", "Olympic torch", "Sport", "McDonald's", "Coca-Cola", "Lloyds Banking Group", "Olympic Games"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/jul/27/simon-hoggarts-week-politicians-nonverbal-signals", "title": "Simon Hoggart's Week: Politicians' nonverbal signals are a hard to report", "sentences": ["Then the buses: Coca-Cola, Lloyds Bank and Samsung, the last filled with gyrating women as if in a Bangkok bar."]}, {"article": "Modern parenting seems to be in trouble when it comes to managing the boundaries between the generations. In some households, Mum and Dad pretend to be their children&apos;s &quot;best friends&quot;. They may even become fans of the same boy bands or share a tent at Glastonbury. They splash cash and offer 24-hour catering. It&apos;s even rumoured that \u2013 if begged \u2013 they&apos;ll do homework or pass their child&apos;s exams. All of which indicates to me there&apos;s a crisis in Parentland. Not that this applies to you, although your sprog may soon be trogging off to college or Peru. September is the cruellest month for separation anxiety. And more often than not, it&apos;s the parents who can&apos;t bear the separation. We no longer feel we&apos;re abandoning our children on campus but that they&apos;ve abandoned us at home. And so we muddle the bounds, with a little help from technology. En route from dropping them at uni, we text the darlings. Our messages are superficially comforting. Are they OK? Did we forget something? Have they got cash, cake and condoms? Will they be sure to Skype this evening? When shall we come for a visit? Do you want to put eight tickets for next year&apos;s May ball on our credit card? If you&apos;re at all homesick, for God&apos;s sake call. Please let everyone know on Facebook that you&apos;ve temporarily relocated \u2013 with the stress on temporarily \u2013 because we&apos;re entering a major phase of complicated grief in a blind panic and we&apos;re the ones who need the comforting! In times past, children would probably have cut their apron strings sooner. My bid for freedom followed O-levels. At 16, I flounced out of my Cheshire home with a rucksack, a leaky umbrella and an indeterminate plan to become a Scottish crofter. I got as far as hitchhiking to Carlisle before the rain pelted down and nobody would give me a lift. When I phoned home, my dad just said: &quot;Where are you? I&apos;ll be there.&quot; I&apos;m grateful to this day that he didn&apos;t try to humiliate me. Next time, I crossed the border and stayed. A year after, I hitched to Istanbul and back. No, I didn&apos;t phone home; I was trusted to send the odd postcard. The prevailing wisdom of my parents was that children need a pinch of risk as much as vitamins. (Without it, they will never learn a thing and probably turn into Howard Hughes, the once reckless aviator who ended his days encased in a latex tent with 22-inch fingernails.) I do speak about relative risk. I don&apos;t hold with dumping your babies on mountains like the ancient Spartans to see if the wolves are partial to frozen steak. Nor do I complain that after centuries of preferring horses to children, Britons have become more caring as parents and no longer stick minors up chimneys or birch their bums. I belong to an excellent charity called Children are Unbeatable, which is dedicated to ending the right of parents to commit common assault on their young. But there&apos;s caring and caring. Consider the case of the black-headed gull \u2013 a pest in some eyes \u2013 but probably a better parent than we humans . Mother bird simply locks the larder once junior can fly, having attained an adult size and weight. The rule is simple: &quot;No more regurgitated mackerel for you, my pet, find your own!&quot; Days will pass while outraged child prods her with the cry of &quot;Gimme&quot; like some stroppy teenager deprived of broadband. But the young bird adapts. It has to. The law of our animal kingdom says there&apos;s a time to grow up. A time that we as social animals sometimes seem determined to push into middle age. All parents &quot;fail&quot; in some sense. A noted shrink once told me: &quot;A parent&apos;s place is in the wrong.&quot; No, I do not underestimate the challenges. But I do suggest that an overprotected child is a deprived one and if they find themselves in an arrested stage of development they should make a claim for psychological abuse. There&apos;s evidence that our brains don&apos;t think objectively until at least the age of 25, so you could claim it doesn&apos;t greatly matter if our offspring are unsure of themselves at twentysomething. But the evidence from history suggests that a sterner environment is perfectly capable of training this undeveloped brain into well-intended social action from the early teens, whether that activity is becoming the head of the household like a child in modern Bangkok or fighting the fascists in the last world war. So when adolescents do depart, how can a helicopter parent come to terms with slowing their rotors and whirling less dervishly? First, you might take comfort from the fact that when your kids vanish, even though your heart is breaking, like an expensive boomerang they&apos;ll be back. I promise you that. &quot;When the boy moves out,&quot; we used to say, and I imply no lack of love for my youngest, &quot;I can stop working weekends and we could repaint the entire flat.&quot; &quot;New rugs!&quot; shouted my partner deliriously. It also occurred to us that not worrying about our womb fruit pleasuring his playmate with mixed grills, all-night movies and the spare mattress might in itself constitute a home improvement. And so he left. Not yet 20 and gone to cohabit with his mischosen one on his grandfather&apos;s minute legacy. I felt down but not distraught. We passed happy days refurbishing everything. The new carpets were as swish as an ice rink. But at this moment, half a year on, our prodigal hit the financial rocks, reoccupied his old quarters and while finalising a work of art, mainly in the bathroom sink, succeeded in scattering indelible pink ink from a leaky Tesco bag into the centre of the virgin Axminster. Second, and far more importantly, separation is good and essential for you both. It&apos;s truistic to state that children need to become independent decision-makers who learn from their own mistakes and failures. Otherwise, how will they manage to put your affairs in order on the day you die? Since you cannot promise to live forever, you have to learn to let them go. But for your own sake (and to follow up this idea scan the works of the brilliant psychologist Erik Erikson) you need to deal with the &quot;tasks&quot; of your very different stage of life. These do not include getting down on the dancefloor with the kids but facing up to the fact that, as a parent, you are becoming unemployed and are confronted by a void of bereavement that you must confront. For as long as you cling to your children like a lifebelt, you will cease to grow up.

To millions of fans he is simply Super Dan. Lin Dan&apos;s gripping showdown with a long-time rival, Malaysia&apos;s Lee Chong Wei, showed why he is a legend in the badminton world and his homeland. The four-times world champion added his hard-won gold to the one he took at the Beijing Games in 2008. That time, too, he was fighting off Lee. His jubilation at becoming the first man to retain the badminton singles title was uncontrollable. It took a tackle by his beaming coaches to halt his celebratory sprint around the court \u2014 and his grin was unstoppable after he secured his 15-21, 21-10, 21-19 win. Perhaps it also reflected some relief: this summer he had crashed out at the Thai Open in Bangkok, to the shock of many. But the 28-year-old had already claimed the &quot;Super Grand Slam&quot;, as the only player to have won all nine major titles. &quot;I don&apos;t think that anyone is close to him, to be honest \u2026 He is the best player ever,&quot; the Denmark&apos;s former world No1 Peter Gade said recently. Lin, from southern Fujian province, took up the sport at five. &quot;From the very first time I walked into a badminton hall and picked up a racquet, there was no turning back. I knew I never wanted to leave the court,&quot; he once told an interviewer. The left-hander joined the sports division of the People&apos;s Liberation Army eight years later and has been on the national team since he was 18. His cheekbones and pecs have won him as many admirers as his skill with a racket. The vast range of products he has endorsed testifies to his Beckham-esque appeal. &quot;First of all, his record in badminton is fabulous,&quot; said Zhu Chong of China&apos;s Economic Observer newspaper. &quot;Secondly, he&apos;s good looking. He is very easy to promote. Thirdly, he has a distinctive character. Many athletes won&apos;t tell the public they have a girlfriend, but he has never felt shy about talking about it. &quot;Actually, Chinese athletes are not allowed to have relationships with members of the same team, but Lin Dan talked about it and did high-profile things for his girlfriend, like giving her flowers. That all attracted a lot of attention: the media love to write about it and people like to read gossip. On top of that, he knows how to express himself.&quot; Two years ago Lin wed his long-term sweetheart Xie Xingfang, herself a former badminton world champion. They were nicknamed the &quot;Condor couple&quot; in reference to a Chinese novel featuring a fiery warrior and his calmer lover: Lin has engaged in public spats in the past, and once had to take to his blog to deny reports he had hit his coach. He has admitted to feeling pressure: &quot;Every player gets nervous. When you&apos;re young it&apos;s because you&apos;re excited, it&apos;s the first time you wear your national colours. When you&apos;re older, it&apos;s because there&apos;s a lot of expectation.&quot; He had also warned that the men&apos;s game has become far more competitive than it was four years ago and vowed to use every day before the Games to prepare and improve. It may well be his final Olympics. This spring he acknowledged his phenomenal run is entering its last stages. In March he said he would probably continue playing after the Games. But days later, after taking his fifth All England title, he swapped shirts with Lee in a gesture of friendship, telling reporters: &quot;We are both reaching the end of our careers and the game is not always about winning and losing. It&apos;s something more important.&quot; Whether his arch-rival agrees in the aftermath of a second Olympics defeat at Lin&apos;s hands is another matter.", "publicationDate": "2012-08-05T15:27:16Z", "tags": ["Olympics 2012: badminton", "Badminton", "Olympic Games 2012", "Sport", "China Olympic team", "Olympic Games"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/05/london-2012-table-tennis-china", "title": "London 2012: Lin Dan's profile soars after second Olympic badminton gold", "sentences": ["Perhaps it also reflected some relief: this summer he had crashed out at the Thai Open in Bangkok, to the shock of many."]}, {"article": "When the last great struggle for Scotland&apos;s soul is at an end, Alex Salmond may yet have cause to thank the nation&apos;s kenspeckle comic publishers, DC Thomson. But only if his advisers have the prescience to grasp the cactus right now. Our first minister is, arguably, the most impressive politician Scotland has produced since the war. And although he has always sensibly ignored those wretched impostors, humility and discretion, even he must admit that luck is the greatest gift that God can bestow on a leader. Early last month, it was announced that 1,700 jobs were at risk with the imminent closure of Hall&apos;s of Broxburn, sausage-makers to the nation. But even as our solicitous finance minister, John Swinney, wrung his hands and furrowed his brow in a caring manner alongside the local community, rescue was at hand. For the 2012 London Olympics were just about to start and, as everyone now knows, these were the greatest Games that have ever taken place since the splendid Greek pugilist Diagoras of Rhodes bestrode the event in 464BC. For nearly three weeks, time seemed to stand still and the squalid concerns of hoi polloi such as long-term unemployment and the dismantling of the NHS were rendered meaningless. For how could anyone be depressed while we witnessed the spiritual reawakening of humanity amid the heroics of Jessica, Mo and Sir Chris? Already, there have been, as yet unsubstantiated, reports of miraculous healings of sick infants. A helmeted chap on a bike and sporting extraordinary sideburns has even been seen at dawn cycling on the water near the Thames flood barrier. Yet such was the sense of unity and togetherness that these sacred games had wreaked that the independence dream of those vile separatists and backwoodsmen of the SNP seemed to have been destroyed forever. Had the gas of Alex Salmond ever been set at such a lowly peep? But, as has happened throughout Scotland&apos;s benighted history, cometh the hour, cometh Desperate Dan. The news that the big Tayside carnivore may finally have eaten his last cow pie has had an electrifying effect on the Scottish body politic. It is as though a cattle prod has been stuck up the nation&apos;s collective jacksie. There is a new sense of purpose abroad. Why, even the first minister himself, a well-known Oor Wullie and Daphne Broon man, announced that he was switching his allegiance as news broke that the splendid Dandy adventure comic publication was about to cease printing owing to poor sales. Said a subdued Mr Salmond: &quot;I have fond childhood memories of reading the Dandy and it&apos;s a shame future generations won&apos;t be able to enjoy the printed edition.&quot; Already you can detect that the fabled political antennae of the first minister are bristling. Surely the SNP could adopt Desperate Dan and his Dandy cartoon confreres and put them in the vanguard of the beleaguered and stuttering indie campaign. They&apos;d simply be replacing the comic characters already assembled by Blair Jenkins&apos;s Yes Scotland group with the real thing. And Jenkins, the mischievous and boisterous former BBC Scotland news chief, knows the value of entertainment and fun-for-all-the-family frolics. The SNP has stacks of money and the donations keep on pouring in. They could even afford to spend nearly half a million quid renting out the Army &amp; Navy Club in London to put on ceilidhs and haggis-making classes during the Olympics. So if they can spend so much money on such a self-indulgent frippery, surely they could push the boat out a little more and publish a new and updated version of the Dandy for smart, 21st-century Scotland. All our favourite characters could be slightly recalibrated to deliver those messages that the government wants the world to receive about modern Scotia. And how many independence votes might be garnered by giving such a much-loved title a new lease of life? So, in the new filial spirit of Olympic civility and all that, here are a few suggestions for the SNP advisers on how to use Dan and his pals to rejuvenate the faltering independence campaign. Desperate Dan We first see new modern Dan as a broken alcoholic surrounded by the detritus of a life badly lived in Dundee&apos;s low dives and flophouses, known locally as the civic centre. But after his long-lost girlfriend Little Bear, in the guise of a Tannadice Street tenement dweller, appears to him in a dream he vows to change his life. He abjures his cow pies for sunblush tomato and goat&apos;s cheese baguettes and begins to use a Remington Philishave. Soon, he finds employment as a local authority play co-ordinator and wins over kids and parents alike after first overcoming his haphazard approach to risk-assessment. Bananaman The muscle-bound superhero is a comic-book favourite with his vivid yellow-and-blue livery. But in the new modern Scottish version he becomes the posterboy for healthy eating. Now he flies hither and yonder, weaning fat children off dodgy food and replacing it with his trusty bananas. His yellow-and-blue cape becomes green and blue and soon he is using his superpowers to stop supporters of Celtic and Rangers singing offensive songs. If they refuse, he whisks them off to the new Scottish government detention centres to await transportation. Beryl the Peril We see Beryl in a youth correctional facility where she has been placed for her own protection.

Under the new rules, journalists will no longer have to submit their work to state censors before publication as they have for the past 50 years. The move was cautiously welcomed by Burmese journalists as another sign of openness following the release of the opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi in November 2010. But deep concerns remain about restrictive press laws that are still in place and allow the authorities to crack down on journalists and even close publications deemed a threat to national security. Ye Naing Moe, who has worked as a journalist in Rangoon for 13 years, said the move made him feel hopeful for the future but that the battle was not yet won. &quot;It is the beginning of a new age with new challenges and threats ahead,&quot; he warned. Matthew F Smith, a researcher with Human Rights Watch, said: &quot;It&apos;s a positive development but too early to get enthusiastic. There is still an enormous amount of work to do to ensure press freedoms are protected. The same people who oversaw the jailing of journalists remain in power today. &quot;This is an important announcement but there will still be a lot of pressure on journalists to self-censor and there is still a risk that journalists will be targeted by the authorities for probing sensitive issues.&quot; Burma&apos;s reporters had long been regarded as among the most restricted in the world. But President Thein Sein&apos;s reformist government has significantly relaxed media controls over the last year, allowing reporters to print material that would have been unthinkable during the era of absolute military rule \u2013 such as photographs of Aung San Suu Kyi when she was under house arrest in Rangoon. The information ministry, which has long controlled what can be printed, made the announcement on its website on Monday. Contrary to expectation, the censor board will not be abolished. Monday&apos;s announcement indicated it will retain the powers it has always had to suspend publications or revoking publishing licences if it deems publishing rules are violated. Nyein Nyein Naing, an editor from the 7 Day News Journal who attended Monday&apos;s meeting, said journalists will still have to submit their articles to the censor board. But now, she said, they will be required to do so after publication, apparently to allow the government to determine whether any publishing laws are violated. Those laws, in place since a military coup in 1962, include edicts prohibiting journalists from writing articles that could threaten peace and stability, oppose the constitution or insult ethnic groups. Critics say some laws are open to interpretation and give the government enormous power to silence dissent. They have been used repeatedly in recent years to jail members of the press. Nyein Nyein Naing welcomed the government announcement, but she added: &quot;We have to be very cautious as [the state censor board] will keep monitoring us.&quot; It was not immediately clear to what degree continued government scrutiny could lead to self-censorship. Some topics remain highly sensitive, such as corruption and alleged abuses committed by army officers during the previous ruling junta. Overzealous authorities could use the threat of prosecution to prevent articles from being published or exact harsh punishments for material they dislike. As recently as 11 June, the government&apos;s press scrutiny and registration department ordered the suspension of a magazine called Snapshot. According to the Irrawaddy report, Snapshot had published a photo of a woman who was raped and murdered in Arakan State, igniting a wave of violence in the remote region of western Burma. Late last month, the censor board again flexed its muscles by ordering the suspension of two weekly magazines, the Voice Weekly and Envoy, for speculating on a still-anticipated cabinet reshuffle. Those punishments have since been lifted, and the two magazines are due to begin publishing again on 18 August. Shawn Crispin, the Committee to Protect Journalists&apos; south-east Asia representative in Bangkok, said that &quot;if the government is sincere in ending pre-publication censorship, it would represent a significant step forward for press freedom in Burma&quot;. However, he added that if press laws were not also reformed, &quot;then all of these promises can be easily rolled back if they feel a free press threatens government security&quot;. &quot;It is very encouraging for a journalist like me who has been struggling with this pre-press censorship for years,&quot; said Ye Naing Moe, a Burmese journalist who began his career working for an illegal weekly magazine during the 1988 uprising. He added: &quot;I cordially welcome this announcement and feel positive for the future, but it does not mean I ignore the new types of challenges and battles lying ahead. At least now we just have left behind the most terrible way of controlling freedom of expression in [our] history.&quot; He said recent protests by young journalists demanding the right to publish freely may have prompted the move \u2013 but that a happy ending was not guaranteed after such a long spell of media oppression. &quot;It&apos;s not a black and white situation. It is the beginning of a new age with new challenges and threats ahead. There are still many people who are not happy with the reforms.&quot; Dr Tint Swe, a former politician from Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s National League for Democracy party who has been in exile in Delhi for 20 years, said Burma&apos;s military rulers were terrified of a popular uprising like those seen in the Middle East. &quot;They are afraid of an Arab spring,&quot; he said, adding that the decision was another attempt to persuade the US in particular to drop sanctions against Burma. Plus, he said, a new net-savvy generation in Burma was now able to read foreign news rather than just the two state-owned propaganda sheets, the English-language New Light of Myanmar and the Burmese-language Mirror. &quot;A new generation is being exposed to the outside world \u2013 the generals&apos; children are now on a different wavelength from their parents,&quot; said Swe. Until recently, editions of New Light of Myanmar included a section entitled &quot;People&apos;s desire&quot; which listed a string of instructions for Burma&apos;s citizens. These included: &quot;oppose those relying on external elements, acting as stooges, holding negative views&quot;; &quot; oppose those trying to jeopardise stability of the state and progress of the nation&quot;; &quot;oppose foreign nations interfering in internal affairs of the state&quot; and &quot;crush all internal and external destructive elements as the common enemy&quot;.", "publicationDate": "2012-08-20T12:14:33Z", "tags": ["Censorship", "South and Central Asia", "Press freedom", "Journalist safety", "Media", "World news", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/burma-ends-advance-press-censorship", "title": "Burma ends advance press censorship", "sentences": ["Shawn Crispin, the Committee to Protect Journalists&apos; south-east Asia representative in Bangkok, said that &quot;if the government is sincere in ending pre-publication censorship, it would represent a significant step forward for press freedom in Burma&quot;."]}, {"article": "Uni enterprise funding This is Bath: The University of Bath has won a share of \u00a32 million to support social enterprise projects.

Young women in bikinis and high heels and bare-chested young men danced to a blasting techno beat. Others splashed in the three tiered pools with inflatable lily pads and gyrated around stripper poles. The thirsty lined the bar with J\u00e4gerbomb cocktails. &quot;This is where you come for a party,&quot; Ajay Mistry, 25, an insurance strategist from London, shouted over the music. He wore sunglasses, an inflatable ring and a wide grin. &quot;I see myself as a seasoned partier but you don&apos;t see this in England.&quot; As he spoke a group of girls chased each other into a pool, laughing, pursued by a musclebound companion clutching four beers. It was 3.30am and things were just warming up. Planet Las Vegas, in other words, continued to orbit as normal despite the storm on both sides of the Atlantic over the nude Prince Harry pictures. Moralists who may have hoped for at least a blush from Sin City were disappointed. It embraced the scandal with glee, adding the prince to the pantheon of celebrities who have sustained its image of Babylonian hedonism. &quot;Las Vegas is a place to celebrate adult freedom, freedom that even celebrities and royals can enjoy,&quot; said Cathy Tull, a spokesperson for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. As the city continued partying, however, and as Harry returned to England for the expected carpeting from Buckingham Palace and a rumoured head-to-head with his exasperated father Prince Charles, the question remained: why does this neon mecca in the desert so enthrall twentysomethings the world over? There are, after all, equally racy alternatives such as Ibiza, Ios, Goa and Bangkok which are cheaper and often closer to home. Las Vegas, with its fake architecture and near-zombified slot machine players, many of them elderly, could seem square in comparison. Yet it remains a magnet for foreigners who comprised about a quarter of last year&apos;s 38.9 million visitors, the second best on record. This year may surpass that with the help of Britons arriving on expanded BA flights and a new Virgin Atlantic route. Las Vegas&apos;s response to the Harry brouhaha underlined its shrewd \u2013 critics would say shameless \u2013 marketing instincts. While the royal family tried to stop British newspapers from publishing photos that went viral on the internet, Sin City hailed Harry as a worthy son. Tourism authorities placed an advert in USA Today on Friday saying fault lay not with the 27-year-old prince&apos;s decision to invite a hen party to his suite at the Encore Wynn resort and get naked but with the guest who snapped him \u2013 cupping his genitals in one image, bear-hugging a naked young woman in another \u2013 and sold the images to the gossip website TMZ. It was, said the advert with mock solemnity, a violation of the code that what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. &quot;For shame! To those who traded in their pledge to their Las Vegas brethren, we deplore you! We are asking for a shun on these exploiters \u2026 we shall boycott partying of any kind with them. No bottle service. No bikini-clad girls. No Bucatini from Batali. In other words, we will not play with them any more.&quot; In reality Las Vegas has adapted to an era in which visitors prefer to celebrate and often embroider their exploits on social media rather than hush them up. Bars and nightclubs have no prohibition against cameras or smartphones. The belief that all publicity is good publicity stretches back to the 1940s when fledgling casinos pitched the nearby atomic test blasts which broke their windows as another reason to visit. The city&apos;s official mascot was Miss Mushroom Cloud. Earlier this year it played up its mafia past by opening a mob museum. &quot;Vegas wants to fuel the notion that Three Finger Lenny could be at the blackjack table beside you ordering a hit, even though organised crime has had nothing to do with hotels here for 25 years,&quot; said Michael Green, a history professor at the University of Nevada. The city, he said, thrived on selling fantasy. Just as its architecture mimicked Roman temples, Venetian canals and the Eiffel Tower, its reputation steeped visitors in the sensation of hedonism, regardless of what they actually did. The in-your-face promotions of prostitution show sleaze is real but many if not most visitors avoid decadence. Many are families with young children. Others are elderly whose principal vices are slot machines and blackjack. Even Harry, despite hysterical reactions implying he was Kubla Khan, behaved just like many bachelors his age. With the difference, of course, that he was third in line to the throne and did not have to trawl Expedia.com seeking bargains. Steve Wynn, the billionaire resort owner, waived his entourage&apos;s estimated \u00a330,000 bill. &quot;He represents the British people more than anyone else [in the royal family]. I&apos;d rather he did that than be uptight,&quot; said Mistry, the insurance strategist, as he partied in Surrender, the same club as Harry. &quot;In England we like to think of ourselves as crazy partiers but in reality we&apos;re not. Very few go to a club and talk to someone new.&quot; Las Vegas glinted with sexual promise but much of the appeal was great weather, indulgent bouncers and lack of queues, he said. &quot;I&apos;d say it&apos;s 25% to 30% about sex. Mainly it&apos;s about having fun with your friends.&quot; The city generated an exhilaratingly unreal atmosphere. &quot;When you&apos;re here you look at it like you&apos;re in the cinema,&quot; said Mistry. It is a triumph of marketing that most would think of George Clooney in Ocean&apos;s Eleven or Sharon Stone in Casino rather than grittier scenes that could have been scripted by Roddy Doyle \u2013 such as two inebriated young Irishmen with shaved heads weaving out of Surrender yelling abuse at equally drunk Americans: &quot;Ye Yankee fucks!&quot; In the wake of the Harry furore more Britons than ever seem keen to view the spectacle. Virgin Holidays reported a 30% spike in interest. Mohamed Airoz, a 21-year-old from Saudi Arabia, sat on a ledge by the pool with wide-eyed awe watching others frolic. &quot;This is the best place I have ever been,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s more than I expected.

They bundled her into a van and for the 20 hours it took to drive from Cancun in southern Mexico, where she lives, north to the city of Puebla she was, she says, &quot;tortured&quot;. Sexual assault was threatened. A gun was pushed into her mouth. A sickening see-saw: &quot;I kept thinking one minute I was going to die, then that I would survive.&quot; When they arrived, a female guard told her she would be raped in jail. In fact, a network of friends, contacts and activists swung into action and she was bailed. Attempts on her life continued, and she has become well known as one of Mexico&apos;s bravest journalists. A recent estimate put the number killed there since 2006 at 67. Amid this, Cacho started work on her next book. This story tells you several things about Cacho and the world she works in: alleged corruption (tapes surfaced that appeared to show her arrest was orchestrated by a man she had written about, alleging he had connections to a paedophile ring), the vulnerability of Mexico&apos;s journalists, and that Cacho is not somebody who can be silenced. Her new book, Slavery Inc: the Untold Story of International Sex Trafficking, is about to be published in the UK. Although she has lived with death threats for years, she took the most recent one four weeks ago seriously enough to leave the country. On 29 July, she received a call on her satellite radio from a man who told her she was a &quot;fucking bitch&quot; who had ignored their warnings, concluding: &quot;We are going to send you home in pieces.&quot; &quot;The way they interfered with my radio, it had to be someone who had the power and the means,&quot; she says. &quot;Immediately I called some security experts, one here in London, and told them. They said to get out of the house immediately. I\u00a0called my lawyers and they said the same thing, so I did. I just took my passport and a bag and got out of there.&quot; Is Cacho frightened? If the question is obvious, the answer isn&apos;t. She sits across the table in an office in central London, utterly composed, an occasional flicker of rage behind dark eyes. &quot;I think it&apos;s absurd,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;m telling the truth, I&apos;m a good journalist and I have to flee my country.&quot; Later she says: &quot;I don&apos;t scare easily.&quot; She has been offered asylum in several countries \u2013 not just on this occasion, but in the past \u2013 but has never wanted to take it. &quot;I like my country. [In Mexico] really good journalists are so badly needed. It&apos;s important. I\u00a0want to be there to see the change.&quot; Is she prepared for how long she might have to stay away? A deep sigh. &quot;I want to go back home, everything is there \u2013 my house, my dogs. I&apos;m trying to find out who did it and expose them, which is the only thing I can do to save my life.&quot; She thinks this threat is related to her book, in which she names men who she says are involved in sex trafficking in Mexico. She travels to some of the world&apos;s sex tourism centres to piece together her story on the thriving global sex trade, much of it told through the testimonies of women and children. She met children rescued from sex slavery in Cambodia and Guatemala. A North American woman who told her how her &quot;employers&quot; \u2013 she thought she would be working as a singer in a nightclub \u2013 confiscated her visa and plane ticket and over several days kept her prisoner in a hotel room where she was drugged and raped by dozens of men. A woman from Venezuela, who escaped her traffickers in Mexico, was able to identify numerous immigration officials either as clients or those who had facilitated the passage of girls flown into the country. Dressed as a nun in Mexico City \u2013 the only safe way, she decided, for a woman to walk its mafia-controlled areas \u2013 Cacho saw children working as prostitutes in motels. Finding figures for the number of people trafficked and enslaved is notoriously difficult; in 2005, the International Labour Organisation said 2.4 million at any one time are trafficked into forced labour, with at least 43% of these forced to work in the sex industry, but it&apos;s a conservative estimate. &quot;The point of the\u00a0book was to understand how the international markets are connected,&quot; she says. &quot;As a reporter, I was really frustrated, because every time I\u00a0interviewed an expert, everyone kept telling me they&apos;re not linked, that this isn&apos;t an international business. But it is.&quot; She was threatened throughout her research. &quot;In Bangkok, I stayed in very nice hotels because it was the way to see the rich European clients who bring girls or boys to the hotel. I would be sitting in the bar, and have my camera with me, and someone would always come over, a\u00a0waiter, saying, &apos;Be careful, don&apos;t do that, you&apos;re a journalist, right?&apos; In Cambodia, I had to flee a casino and hide in my hotel.&quot; She tried to barricade herself into her room with furniture. &quot;I thought it was clever.&quot; She laughs. &quot;And then I thought: &apos;This is stupid, they have guns and I just have a chair against the door.&apos;&quot; Before she started the investigation, Cacho says she was open to the idea of legalising and regulating prostitution, and had listened to many academics and feminists who advocated it. &quot;Then the more I travelled, and the more women I\u00a0interviewed, the more worried I got,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;m absolutely convinced that all forms of prostitution are just a way of normalising gender discrimination and violence against women, and women are &apos;trained&apos; to become prostitutes because they are objects in a society that\u00a0wants to have ghettoes of women who can be raped.&quot; She adds she doesn&apos;t really believe women can &quot;choose&quot; to become a prostitute: &quot;In order to make a choice, you really need to have opportunities and options. If you don&apos;t, you are not really choosing, you are just getting by.&quot; She says there isn&apos;t just the stereotypical idea of children and women who are abducted and enslaved (though these do, of course, exist); there are the women who are duped and find themselves owing thousands of dollars to the men who control them. Women, Cacho writes, who &quot;have been conditioned to sell their bodies, and believe prostitution is the only way for them to make a living&quot;. In Cambodia, Cacho met a woman who runs a brothel who explained how she &quot;reprograms&quot; girls by &quot;normalising sexual exploitation through systematic exposure to pornography. They have to be convinced that they were the ones who chose to do this, and\u00a0they must be constantly reminded that their lives are worth nothing.&quot; Even the women she met who were earning thousands of dollars, seemingly free to leave when they wanted, didn&apos;t convince her that sex work could be a rational and free labour choice. &quot;After a while, when you get in depth in an interview, they start telling you how miserable they are, how they are mistreated by clients, how they hate the\u00a0smell of them, or the way the clients behave. They start giving you little stories that are stories of violence.&quot; She tries to knit together the links that stretch across the world. She met the former wife of a drug trafficker who described how young women were first exploited as prostitutes, then forced to work in their factories making illegal drugs, and how contacts were met in London, and were formed with gangs in\u00a0Mexico and Cuba. Police in different countries have told her how many police, politicians and the judiciary are clients of brothels run by organised criminals. The tangle she portrays is overwhelming. The sex trade is growing, she says, in part &quot;because politicians all\u00a0over the world are not addressing poverty. They are not really improving the lives of women and girls.&quot; One reason for the growth of pornography and prostitution, Cacho believes, is that while women&apos;s rights are improving in many places, &quot;the culture of masculinity has not changed at all&quot;. The fact that there are men, she points out, from Europe and North America, who &quot;go to Mexico, Venezuela, Cambodia, Thailand to have sex with women there is telling you something&quot;. She remembers a young man in Spain who explained he used prostitutes because he couldn&apos;t be bothered to talk to the women he met in\u00a0his everyday life as equals. What she would love to see, she writes, is a &quot;new masculine revolution \u2026 a new generation of men, not warriors, not armed, not threatening divine punishment, not violent, but men who possess a strong sense of progress and justice&quot;. Cacho was born into a large family in Mexico City. Her father was an engineer, her French mother a psychologist who was involved in the feminist movement. &quot;They way she saw the world was really enlightening for me,&quot; she says. &quot;It was shocking to live in a house in which equality was really implemented every day with my brothers and sisters, and then go out in to a country that didn&apos;t respect the rights of women.&quot; At 23, she became a reporter, and started writing about violence against women. &quot;My editor said, &apos;This is good, stick to that.&apos; I thought, yes, this is what I like doing.&quot; In 1999, a man followed her into the bathroom of a bus station in Cancun and inflicted a brutal attack, in which she was raped and had several bones broken \u2013 an attack, she believes, that was &quot;punishment&quot; for her work. And so the threats continued, especially once she started trying to expose a paedophile ring in Cancun for her previous book, Demons of Eden (one of the men she wrote about, Jean Succar Kuri, was sentenced last year). For a time, she travelled in an armoured car and had federal bodyguards; she dispensed with them three years ago after her car was sabotaged. &quot;I lost a lot of friends and I\u00a0respected that \u2013 they said they didn&apos;t want to be seen with me in public. My social life changed dramatically. You learn how to walk the\u00a0street and be looking all the time for\u00a0signs of somebody coming, like a\u00a0motorcycle.&quot; The psychological toll is alleviated with therapy, yoga, and \u2013 until now \u2013 spending time in her garden with her dogs, &quot;getting in touch with the earth, life. I have a sense of humour. A lot of people think I&apos;m weird because I can laugh about the worst things that happen \u2013 not when they&apos;re happening, but afterwards. I think that&apos;s healthy. You get cynical if you can&apos;t laugh.&quot; The risks are real. In April, her friend, the Mexican investigative journalist Regina Martinez, was killed. Anna Politkovskaya was also a friend; Cacho recalls they met two months before the\u00a0Russian journalist was murdered in\u00a02006. She searches for the words: &quot;Reality. Shock.&quot; The only thing to do is to keep working. (She can&apos;t stop \u2013 yesterday, she says, she was in her hotel room forwarding a Facebook page she believes is used by a paedophile ring to Interpol.) As well as her writing, she has founded a women&apos;s shelter in Cancun; last year, it provided refuge or psychological and legal help to 30,000 women fleeing abuse. Cacho never wanted to become the story, but\u00a0the threats on her life also bring a spotlight to her work, and to the dangers faced by her colleagues. &quot;I&apos;ve never wanted a quiet life, otherwise I wouldn&apos;t be a reporter or an activist,&quot; she says. &quot;Of course, I get fed up with the politics and the corruption, but I never question my work. We are journalists because we want to change the world.&quot; She smiles. &quot;I think my job has made a\u00a0difference.&quot; Slavery Inc: the Untold Story of International Sex Trafficking by Lydia Cacho is published on 6 September by Portobello Books, priced \u00a314.99.

OR: AMATEUR LINGUISTICS ANALYSIS, WITH THE FIVER With Liverpool having concluded the summer&apos;s transfer business with a sum total of two strikers on the books and a numbing defeat to Arsenal, the PR department at Fenway Sports Group have a job of work on their hands. Fortunately, the club&apos;s supporters are keeping to their famously serene form and not panicking at all, but John W Henry felt it necessary, nonetheless, to issue a soothing letter featuring a rhetorigasm of persuasive devices. EMPATHY. A classic opener, according to the Fiver&apos;s beardy boffin cousin, Professor Frankly Improbable Social Mobility Fiver, who particularly liked the use of &quot;strike force&quot; to refer to Luis Suarez and Fabio Borini: &quot;I am as disappointed as anyone connected with Liverpool Football Club that we were unable to add further to our strike force in this summer transfer window, but that was not through any lack of desire or effort on the part of all of those involved.&quot; DISTANCING. A manoeuvre in which &apos;we&apos; swiftly becomes &apos;they&apos; when it comes to the bungled transfer window (and how said bungling is the result of outside forces \u2013 misfortune \u2013 triumphing over in-house effort): &quot;They pushed hard in the final days of the transfer window on a number of forward targets and it is unfortunate that on this occasion we were unable to conclude acceptable [there are unconfirmed reports that several front-bench politicians have yet to be roused from swoons prompted by the use of such a magnificently uncontextualised relative term] deals to bring those targets in.&quot; PROLEPSIS. POSSIBLY. [The Fiver&apos;s knowledge of rhetorical theory, already barrelling along on loose wheels, crashes on a sharp bend as Professor Frankly Improbable Social Mobility Fiver nips off for a smoke] DANGLING VISIONS OF THE FUTURE, ANYWAY: &quot;But a summer window which brought in three young, but significantly talented starters in Joe Allen, Nuri Sahin and Fabio Borini as well as two exciting young potential stars of the future \u2013 Samed Yesil and Oussama Assaidi \u2013 could hardly be deemed a failure as we build [DINGDINGDINGDINGDING!

HIM! &quot;In Brendan Rodgers we have a talented young manager and we have valued highly his judgement about the make-up of the squad. This is a work in progress. It will take time for Brendan to instil his philosophy into the squad and build exactly what he needs for the long term.&quot; REBUTTAL: &quot;The transfer policy was not about cutting costs.&quot; APPEAL TO COMMON SENSE: &quot;It was \u2013 and will be in the future \u2013 about getting maximum value for what is spent so that we can build quality and depth. We are avowed proponents of Uefa&apos;s Financial Fair Play agenda that was this week reiterated by Mr Platini \u2013 something we heartily applaud.&quot; THINGS CAN ONLY GET BETTER DISCO MIX: &quot;We are still in the process of reversing the errors of previous regimes. It will not happen overnight. It has been compounded by our own mistakes in a difficult first two years of ownership. It has been a harsh education, but make no mistake, the club is healthier today than when we took over.&quot; PATHOS (or, gratuitous and irresponsible use of tradition): &quot;Our ambitions do not lie in cementing a mid-table place with expensive, short-term quick fixes that will only contribute for a couple of years. Our emphasis will be on developing our own players using the skills of an increasingly impressive coaching team.

We have no fear of spending and competing with the very best but we will not overpay for players. We will never place this club in the precarious position that we found it in when we took over at Anfield.&quot; CONSPICUOUS FAILURE TO MENTION MICHAEL OWEN: \u2026 ETHOS: &quot;Finally, I can say with authority that our ownership is not about profit. Contrary to popular opinion, owners rarely get involved in sports in order to generate cash. They generally get involved with a club in order to compete and work for the benefit of their club. It&apos;s often difficult. In our case we work every day in order to generate revenues to improve the club.&quot; EPIDEIXIS (or most likely a present for 1,057 pedants): &quot;We have only one driving ambition at Liverpool and that is the quest to win the Premier League playing the kind of football our supporters want to see.

With only around 1,000 adults left in the wild in just four mountain streams in Iran, it is also critically endangered. But the black, white and orange salamanders are openly on sale for as little as \u00a365 on numerous websites. While these may have been bred in captivity, they are descended from rare individuals taken from the wild, and investigators have identified dealers who say their stocks come from Iran. Two years ago the Kaiser&apos;s spotted newt was listed as one of the first species to be put at risk of extinction by online dealers. Now conservationists are warning that the internet is fueling unprecedented levels of illegal wildlife trade and that for many species this is now the principal threat to their survival. A report due to be published later this year concludes that a growing proportion of wildlife crime is using &quot;deep web&quot; tools more commonly associated with serious financial criminals, drug traffickers and child pornographers. &quot;The internet has without a doubt facilitated the huge expansion of illegal international wildlife trading over the last decade,&quot; said Crawford Allan, of the wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic. &quot;Rare jewels of the forest can now be caught, boxed and shipped almost overnight just like any other express commodity.&quot; It is a wide-ranging business. Elephant ivory is used for ornaments, and parts of tigers and rhinos are used in traditional medicine or ground down and added to wine. Pelts from leopards and polar bears fetch high sums, while rare reptiles, birds and fish are bought as pets. There are no precise figures on the scale of the problem. Global Financial Integrity, a Washington-based lobby group, last year estimated the global illegal wildlife trade to be worth at least \u00a35bn. Various reporting systems and investigations suggest commercial exploitation of many at risk species has reached \u2013 or is close to \u2013 all-time high. Protected live animals and body parts are still traded in shops and markets in cities such as Bangkok and Jakarta, however much of the business is now handled online by middlemen using varying degrees of secrecy. Previous investigations have found a lot of trade taking place relatively openly on auction sites, via classified ads and in enthusiast chat rooms. Products from rhino, tigers and elephants are often advertised as historical artefacts without documentary proof. Animals caught in the wild are described as captive bred. Acronyms, mis-spellings and code words are used to evade detection. &quot;Once you know the terminology and you know how to search, then a lot of it is pretty open,&quot; said Vincent Nijman, a researcher at Oxford Brookes University who has studied the trade. An investigation by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) highlighted the sale of 2,275 elephant ivory items on eight different eBay websites in a single week in 2007. The site subsequently banned such sales, but conservationists say sellers simply avoid using the word &quot;ivory&quot; in item descriptions. In August, for example, a search on eBay&apos;s UK site for &quot;ox bone&quot; \u2013 widely used as a euphemism for elephant ivory \u2013 yielded more than 5,000 results. An eBay spokesman told the Guardian: &quot;eBay works closely with conservation groups such as the IFAW and goes beyond legal requirements to restrict the sale of ivory products on the marketplaces site. The eBay trust and safety team proactively enforces eBay&apos;s policy on ivory products and works quickly to take action to remove listings of items of concern.&quot; In 2008 IFAW identified more than 7,000 wildlife products from threatened species being offered for sale in dozens of online auctions, forums and classified ads. Last year it found ivory worth \u00a3500,000 for sale on 43 sites based in the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Portugal. International trade in wildlife is regulated by the Cites convention. Exploitation of around 800 threatened species is largely banned, while both exporting and importing many others requires permits. A forthcoming report from Traffic, the wildlife trade monitoring network, will reveal how researchers in Canada received emails from dealers offering to export coral without required permits by pretending the specimens were glass. IFAW, which has been working with Interpol, says organised wildlife criminals are becoming increasingly secretive online. The &quot;deep web&quot; has long been used by criminals in other spheres to evade law enforcement. Sites that are not accessible via search engines and which require software to access are used. Communications are bounced through large numbers of computers to maintain anonymity. &quot;Online wildlife trade is seen as a high-profit, low-risk activity by some criminals,&quot; said Kelvin Alfie of IFAW. &quot;A lot is shifting from publicly accessible sites to dark corners of the web.&quot; A report on the ivory trade in the EU to be published later this year by IFAW will highlight the use of tools such as mailing list servers, password-protected sites and encryption. National and international laws to control the trade often pre-date the online trade, and the internet has made the jobs of those trying to enforce the law and protect wildlife even harder. However some say the net can also be used against wildlife criminals. While it helped Kaiser spotted newt dealers to find buyers, the online traces they left alerted investigators to the existence of the trade. &quot;It works both ways,&quot; said Ernie Cooper, also of Traffic. &quot;The internet has made it easier for traders, but it has also helped us research and monitor their activities.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-09-04T07:00:00Z", "tags": ["Illegal wildlife trade", "Wildlife", "Conservation", "Environment", "Internet", "Technology", "Animals", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/04/illegal-wildlife-trade-internet", "title": "Illegal wildlife trading in internet's deepest, darkest corners", "sentences": ["Protected live animals and body parts are still traded in shops and markets in cities such as Bangkok and Jakarta, however much of the business is now handled online by middlemen using varying degrees of secrecy."]}, {"article": "It was the stuff of nightmares for the fourth-richest family in Thailand: an early morning hit-and-run, a policeman whose dead body was dragged for blocks underneath the family car, a trail of motor oil leading the smashed-up Ferrari back to the scene of the crime, a 27-year-old heir nicknamed Boss who denied any wrongdoing, and a family driver exposed by police for attempting to take the blame. The case would have been notable for its recklessness alone. But the fact that it involved Vorayuth Yoovidhya, grandson of the late billionaire founder of the Red Bull empire, made it even more salacious. Front pages and internet posting forums were awash with the news on Tuesday in Thailand, where many commentators were questioning to what degree justice would be served in a case involving one of the world&apos;s richest families, in a nation known for its leniency towards those with money or connections, or both. &quot;Jail is only for the poor. The rich never get punished,&quot; read one comment on Pantip.com, a popular Thai website. &quot;He will receive a suspended sentence and never do any jail time,&quot; wrote one Bangkok Post reader. &quot;This is the only country in the world where you can kill cops and get away with it.&quot; While other cases involving Thai elites \u2013 such as the underage, aristocratic driver who killed nine people after her vehicle collided with a passenger van \u2013 have recently ended in nothing more than a temporary driving ban, Thai police took to the airwaves Tuesday to squash any notions that this particular case would be shelved because of the Red Bull name. &quot;Do not worry that the case will end up with leniency simply because it involves a wealthy family,&quot; police commissioner Anuchai Lekbamroong told Thai radio news programme 100.5FM. &quot;The police will make the decision based on evidence. Everything the police do is being scrutinised by the public.&quot; It is true that all eyes are on both investigators and their suspect, Vorayuth, who goes by the nickname Boss. Despite initially fleeing the scene of the crime, Vorayuth was incriminated after witnesses described a dark Ferrari slamming into a police motorcycle around 5.30am in the upmarket central Bangkok neighbourhood of Thong Lor. Both the motorcycle and its driver were dragged for some 200 metres before the driver sped off towards a gated estate owned by the Red Bull family. There, police found Vorayuth&apos;s \u00a3646,000 charcoal Ferrari, its bonnet dented and windshield smashed, as well as a security log book noting the heir had left the house just minutes before the accident. While Vorayuth later admitted to police that he had hit the policeman, he told investigators the man had abruptly cut in front of him. He was charged with reckless driving and failing to stop or inform authorities \u2013 a potential 10-year jail sentence \u2013 and released on 500,000-baht [\u00a310,100] bail. It was unclear what the results of his blood alcohol test were. The Yoovidhya family, named this year as the fourth richest in Thailand by Forbes magazine, has offered to pay for the late policeman&apos;s funeral. The suspect&apos;s grandfather, Chaleo Yoovidhya, was worth an estimated \u00a33.4bn before his death in March, and left behind a variety of businesses, including the popular Siam Winery, as well as shares in hospitals, real estate and Red Bull itself. He created the energy drink in partnership with the Austrian entrepreneur Dietrich Mateschitz in 1987. In a seeming show of professionalism, Bangkok&apos;s top police official, Lt Gen Comronwit Toopgrajank, has personally taken on the case after he discovered that the local police superintendent had tried to &quot;manipulate the situation&quot; by arresting a bogus suspect \u2013 the family driver \u2013 who allegedly claimed that he had been behind the wheel of the Ferrari. &quot;A policeman is dead. I can&apos;t let this stand,&quot; Comronwit told reporters. &quot;If I let this case get away, I&apos;d rather quit. I don&apos;t care how powerful [the family] are. If I can&apos;t get the actual man in this case, I will resign.&quot; Vorayuth could face more serious charges than reckless driving, if evidence points to an intent to cause death, Comronwit said. Such comments have done little to dispel the doubt many Thais feel towards the judicial system here, however. &quot;The sad thing [is], if the death had been anyone else (not a policeman), it would have gone unchallenged,&quot; wrote one reader on the Bangkok Post website.", "publicationDate": "2012-09-04T17:01:34Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/04/red-bull-heir-hit-run-thailand", "title": "Red Bull heir's deadly hit-and-run stirs debate on justice in Thailand", "sentences": ["&quot;He will receive a suspended sentence and never do any jail time,&quot; wrote one Bangkok Post reader.", "Despite initially fleeing the scene of the crime, Vorayuth was incriminated after witnesses described a dark Ferrari slamming into a police motorcycle around 5.30am in the upmarket central Bangkok neighbourhood of Thong Lor.", "In a seeming show of professionalism, Bangkok&apos;s top police official, Lt Gen Comronwit Toopgrajank, has personally taken on the case after he discovered that the local police superintendent had tried to &quot;manipulate the situation&quot; by arresting a bogus suspect \u2013 the family driver \u2013 who allegedly claimed that he had been behind the wheel of the Ferrari.", "&quot;The sad thing [is], if the death had been anyone else (not a policeman), it would have gone unchallenged,&quot; wrote one reader on the Bangkok Post website."]}, {"article": "Climate change&apos;s impact on future food prices is being underestimated, Oxfam warned in a report on Wednesday. The development charity predicts that massive price spikes will be a devastating blow to the world&apos;s poorest people who today spend up to 75% of their income on food, and will also adversely affect UK consumers. Its report, Extreme Weather, Extreme Price, suggests extreme weather events such as droughts and floods \u2013 made more likely by global warming \u2013 could drive up future food prices. Previous research has tended to consider gradual impacts of rising global temperatures, such as changing rainfall patterns. Oxfam&apos;s research, comissioned by the charity and undertaken by the Institute of Development Studies, examines the impact of extreme weather scenarios on food prices in 2030. It warns that by that date the world could be even more vulnerable to the kind of drought happening today in the US \u2013 the worst in 60 years \u2013 with dependence on US exports of wheat and maize predicted to rise and climate change increasing the likelihood of extreme droughts in North America.            The research claimed that: \u2022 Even under a conservative scenario another US drought in 2030 could raise the price of maize by as much as 140% over and above the average price of food in 2030, which is already likely to be double today&apos;s prices. \u2022 Drought and flooding in southern Africa could increase the consumer price of maize and other coarse grains by as much as 120%. Price spikes of this magnitude today would mean the cost of a 25kg bag of corn meal \u2013 a staple which feeds poor families across Africa for about two weeks \u2013 would rocket from around $18 to $40. \u2022 A nationwide drought in India and extensive flooding across south-east Asia could see the world market price of rice increase by 22%. This could lead to domestic spikes of up to 43% on top of longer term price rises in rice importing countries of such as Nigeria, Africa&apos;s most populous country. \u2022 Climate shocks in sub-Saharan Africa are likely to have an increasingly dramatic impact in 2030 as 95% of grains such as maize, millet and sorghum that are consumed in sub-Saharan Africa are expected to come from the region itself. As well as affecting the world&apos;s poorest, such rises will also hit those on the lowest incomes in the UK, who already spend up to half their household budget on food, the report notes. Oxfam&apos;s climate change policy adviser, Tim Gore, said: &quot;Rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns hold back crop production and cause steady price rises. But extreme weather events \u2013 like the current US drought \u2013 can wipe out entire harvests and trigger dramatic food price spikes. We will all feel the impact as prices spike but the poorest people will be hit hardest.&quot; He said the world needed to wake up to the drastic consequences facing our food system of climate inaction: &quot;As [greenhouse gas] emissions continue to soar, extreme weather in the US and elsewhere provides a glimpse of our future food system in a warming world.

In August, the government said it was halfway to its 2020 emissions goal of a 17% cut on 2005 levels, but the analysis \u2013 the first to date \u2013 says Canada&apos;s cuts amount to one-third at best. &quot;They&apos;re [Canada] just playing with numbers to pretend they&apos;ve actually done something to reduce their emissions,&quot; said Marion Vieweg, a policy analyst working with the Climate Action Tracker (CAT), an independent science-based assessment that tracks the emission commitments and actions of countries. The Canadian government is taking credit for the emissions declines caused by the 2009 recession and the energy trend away from coal to gas, Vieweg told the Guardian from Bangkok at the close of the latest UN climate summit. &quot;There is no information in their reports about their policies that are actually driving emission reductions.&quot; &quot;The [Stephen] Harper government has been working hard to reduce emissions,&quot; said the environment minister, Peter Kent, last month, announcing the government&apos;s statistics. Only a year ago the Harper government said it was 25% cent of the way to its 2020 target. A big part of the difference is a change in the UN rules this year that allows Canada to claim emissions credits for its vast forests because they absorb CO2. But on the other side of the ledger, Canada is one of biggest logging nations and its forests have experienced massive fires and insect outbreaks that have killed hundreds of millions of trees in recent years. Those emissions are missing in Canada&apos;s new numbers and the Harper government assumes there will be few fires or insect problems over the next eight years to 2020, says Vieweg. Meanwhile emissions from Canada&apos;s huge tar sands operations will represent 51% of the entire oil/gas sector in 2012, an increase from a share of only 20% in 2005. Canada has been using current data and measuring it against old projections. And it has begun using a methodology previously only used by developing countries, the CAT report found. &quot;Canada is using accounting tricks to make it look like they are taking action when it&apos;s not,&quot; she said. This week Kent is expected to announce tougher regulations for new coal plants. A year ago draft regulations capped emissions from new coal plants at 375 tonnes of carbon dioxide per gigawatt hour of electricity generated.

The World No4, who will play Tomas Berdych in the semi-finals of the US Open on Friday, will compete at The O2 in London between 5-12 November. It will be the fifth time that Murray has played in the season-ending event, and he is hoping to have another good showing in London, after reaching the Wimbledon final and winning gold at the Olympics. &quot;It&apos;s great to have qualified again for London,&quot; said Murray. &quot;I&apos;ve played some of my best tennis this year on home soil, so hopefully I can also have a good run at The O2 in November.

Billions of dollars have been raised in the past seven years through the United Nations&apos; system to set up greenhouse gas-cutting projects, such as windfarms and solar panels, in poor nations. But the failure of governments to provide firm guarantees to continue with the system beyond this year has raised serious concerns over whether it can survive. A panel convened by the UN reported on Monday at a meeting in Bangkok that the system, known as the clean development mechanism (CDM), was in dire need of rescue. The panel warned that allowing the CDM to collapse would make it harder in future to raise finance to help developing countries cut carbon. Joan MacNaughton, a former top UK civil servant and vice chair of the high level panel, told the Guardian: &quot;The carbon market is profoundly weak, and the CDM has essentially collapsed. It&apos;s extremely worrying that governments are not taking this seriously.&quot; The panel said that governments needed to reassure investors, who have poured tens of billions into the market, by pledging a continuation of the system, and propping up the market by toughening their targets on cutting emissions, and perhaps buying carbon credits themselves. Governments have a last chance to restore confidence in the system when they meet in Qatar this December to discuss climate change. But few participants hold out any hope that they will agree to toughen their 2020 emissions targets, which are scarcely even on the agenda. Instead, governments are focusing on drawing up a new climate change treaty by the end of 2015, which would stipulate emissions cuts for the period after 2020. Under the CDM, developers of projects to cut carbon emissions in developing countries receive a UN-issued carbon credit for every tonne of carbon dioxide the project avoids. This applies to a wide range of activities, from building new windfarms and solar panels, and distributing more efficient cook stoves and lights, to the installation of technology on factories to prevent the release of certain industrial gases. The system was set up under the 1997 Kyoto protocol, after years of debate, but no credits could be issued until that treaty finally came into force in 2005. Since then, just over 1bn CDM credits have been issued. These carbon credits can in theory be bought by the governments which are obliged by the Kyoto protocol to cut their emissions, to count against their targets. In practice, however, with the US refusing to ratify Kyoto and big emerging economies such as China, India and Mexico carrying no emissions-cutting obligations under the treaty, Europe is the only market of any size. The EU has its own cap-and-trade emissions scheme, under which heavy industries are awarded a quota of carbon they can emit, which they can top up by buying the UN credits. But the recession and Eurozone crisis have whipped the rug from under this market. As industrial activity has declined, and the after effects of too-generous carbon quotas early on work themselves through, few EU companies now need to top up their carbon quotas. To make matters worse, the current phase of the Kyoto protocol ends this year, and of the world&apos;s major economies only the EU has pledged to continue it. All of this has combined to bring about a collapse in the price of UN credits, from highs topping $20 (\u00a312.50) before the financial crisis to less than $3 each today. At such rates, many potential projects are not commercially viable. Financiers and project developers have abandoned the market in droves. MacNaughton warned that critics of the market, who argue it does not do enough to cut emissions, could end up regretting its demise, because the years of work it took to set up the market could not easily be replicated. &quot;This is a stable framework, with functioning mechanisms and standards and legal [procedures], and all the things you need for a market. People are assuming this will all still be there in a few years when they want it again, but I don&apos;t think it will [unless they act],&quot; she said. Even if countries decided on reform, no new system could start functioning before 2020, so the CDM could &quot;play a bridging role&quot;. Mitchell Feierstein, chief executive of Glacier Environmental Funds, said the CDM had long been overshadowed by bigger opportunities for green investors. &quot;Carbon markets will exist [in future] but certainly not as they exist today,&quot; he said. &quot;Investment capital will continue flowing into the innovative technologies which increase energy efficiency while reducing global dependence on fossil fuels. Private capital is now more easily deployed in other investment opportunities without the bureaucratic hassles of the current CDM.&quot; But the CDM still has its optimists. Flora Yu, of the carbon specialist IdeaCarbon, said the market was likely to continue, as some countries \u2013 including Australia, China and South Korea \u2013 have been developing their own cap-and-trade carbon markets, which they will want to link to a global system. &quot;There is still a potential opportunity for the CDM, to further develop the amount of money and resources that have already been invested in it. We think it is not going to go away.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-09-10T14:53:31Z", "tags": ["Emissions trading", "Business", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Environment", "Global development", "United Nations", "World news", "Energy", "Global climate talks"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/10/global-carbon-trading-system", "title": "Global carbon trading system has 'essentially collapsed'", "sentences": ["A panel convened by the UN reported on Monday at a meeting in Bangkok that the system, known as the clean development mechanism (CDM), was in dire need of rescue."]}, {"article": "In the wake of the continuing negotiations on climate change in Bangkok last week, businesses need to take action to improve the outcomes for future generations. Number seven of the Children&apos;s Rights and Business Principles launched by Unicef earlier this year is related to the environment. This has global relevance for all businesses, since all business activities impact directly or indirectly on the world that our children will inherit. On a recent trip to Bangladesh, I found that climate-related disasters such as flooding were already having an effect on children&apos;s lives. The country is making efforts to build multi-purpose cyclone shelters, which are also being used as schools. Yet these cyclone shelters, while necessary, may not be sufficient to protect the children in Bangladesh if the world is heading for global warming of more than 3\u00b0C. The effects of climate change have a disproportionate impact on children as well as other vulnerable groups. Children and women are 14 times more likely to be killed in a disaster. Save the Children has found that half of all those affected in an emergency are children, and that an increase in climate-related disasters would mean millions would die or be forced to flee from their homes. Climate change particularly affects agriculture and contributes to rising food prices. Unfortunately, children are particularly vulnerable to this, since malnutrition is already the underlying contributing factor in about one third of all child deaths. The global food crisis of 2008 had a huge impact on child and infant mortality. Ecological debt Like financial debt, ecological debt places a burden on children and future generations. This links to the debate over the recent financial crisis. There have been calls for businesses and investors to consider the triple bottom line of social, environmental, and economic sustainability \u2013 and to reward long-term value creation over the fast buck. At the recent Rio+20 Conference, countries reiterated their commitment to protect the climate &quot;for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind&quot;. Should companies also consider this principle of intergenerational equity? This principle would mean markets and businesses supply the needs of today, without disregarding the needs of tomorrow. Damaging ecosystems and making species extinct leaves an unwelcome legacy. There is the unsettling possibility that this generation might leave the Earth in a worse state than they found it. The recent study in Nature showed humanity may already be overstepping various planetary boundaries, including on biodiversity, nitrogen and climate change. Scientists have also warned that remaining deposits of several irreplaceable and finite mineral resources are being fast depleted. Sourcing and supply chains These business-as-usual trends will not just have external impacts, but systemic impacts that harm us all. Recognising the rights of children means companies should consider sourcing from renewable materials, as well as ensuring materials can be re-used, to preserve vital natural resources. Companies with global supply chains may also consider the impact of global operations on vulnerable communities. For example, Fairtrade coffee companies have been working with their producers down the supply chain to help them become more resilient. The Fairtrade Foundation highlights that rising temperatures would be a disaster for the coffee industry. Reducing the vulnerability of children is low-cost, like ensuring a water supply, and can help develop skills across communities over a long time period. In the UN climate talks in Bangkok earlier this month, the governments of high-emitting countries continued to avoid tackling the issue, often citing financial or competitiveness concerns. Yet in an interconnected world, all businesses will be affected by the emerging challenges for water, food and energy under climate change \u2013 of which the 2008 crisis may be a precursor. The challenges for businesses are similar to those for governments and individuals: the tendency to focus on short-term rather than long-term concerns. The recession may have made this more difficult. However, with energy and input prices rising, there are clearly opportunities for businesses that move towards green growth. Innovative circular business models will reduce risks in a world where inputs are constrained. Previously, corporate considerations of impacts on children were mainly limited to concerns about child labour or health. As the world begins to be hit by climate change, water and resource scarcity, as well as financial crisis, business leaders are in the pivotal position to make decisions that consider wider sustainability and respect the rights of children. In the end, relying on growth that degrades basic resources will not only lead to catastrophe for our children but it is not a sustainable business model either.

Now, according to Thai media, Gangnam Style, by the K-pop star Psy, has inspired a West Side Story-esque show of rivalry between two Bangkok gangs who are said to have had a dance-off before engaging in a gun battle. The INN website reported that the two gangs were dining in the same restaurant when &quot;the younger members of both groups danced provocatively at each other in the manner of top hit Gangnam Style&quot;. The dance-off escalated into an argument and, eventually, a gun attack in the upmarket Ekkamai neighbourhood, in which one of the gangs fired at least 50 bullets from a carbine and an 11mm gun. No one was injured in the incident, police Lt Col Apichart Thongchandee told the Bangkok Post. He said the two gangs had a history of confrontation and would face arrest warrants. The shootout has stoked debate over gang violence in Thailand. Much of the violence plays out in secondary schools and vocational colleges \u2013 the latter primarily cater to working-class children \u2013 where students seek to defend their school&apos;s honour with guns, knives, machetes and even homemade grenades. Between January and July this year, Bangkok police registered more than 1,000 cases of student rivalry, according to a recent report by Agence France-Presse. Several students have been killed or injured since the start of the school year in May. Thai authorities recently established an army-style boot camp where, according to AFP, repeat offenders must endure regular fitness drills and 5am wake-up calls side by side with their rivals. Not all those attending went back home reformed, Lt Col Wanchana Sawasdeem said, &quot;but for 90% it will work, even if it just means they hesitate before fighting \u2026 At least the camp will have made them think.&quot; That the two gangs apparently engaged in a Gangnam Style dance-off is indicative of the video&apos;s popularity. Psy, otherwise known as Park Jae-Sang, told Radio 1&apos;s Scott Mills this week that his distinctive dance style emulated &quot;riding an invisible horse in your lower body&quot;. The video features Park doing the dance all over Seoul \u2013 from car parks to steam rooms \u2013 with a supporting cast dressed as geishas, nuns and boxers. Park sports various outfits, among them a blue tuxedo together with shellacked bouffant and sunglasses. &quot;This is the point of the Gangnam Style,&quot; Park told Mills. &quot;Dress classy and dance cheesy.&quot; The track, which is said to mock the affluent Seoul suburb Gangnam, could become the first Korean pop song to reach number one in the UK charts, according to the BBC. Park has already featured on numerous US TV shows, taught the horse-riding dance to Britney Spears, and helped inspire a flash-mob wedding proposal in Malaysia. The video has been parodied by Los Angeles lifeguards (who, according to LA news outlets, were fired for the stunt), an American college football team and even the government of North Korea.

Products promising to lighten the face, body and armpits are already available across the country, with skin-whitening pills and diet supplements claiming to pick up where the cosmetics leave off. But this is the first time that a vaginal whitening wash has hit the Thai market. In the adverts, which are available online, on TV and on radio, a fair-skinned woman in skinny jeans wanders into her closet to change clothes, describing how &quot;everyone wants to look good \u2013 but tight shorts can leave your skin darker&quot;. The camera then zooms in on her new outfit, which includes a pair of white shorts, to a voiceover claiming that Lactacyd White Intimate can make skin in that area become &quot;bright and translucent&quot;. The launch of a similar product in India this year was met with international disdain after a TV advert insinuated that having a fairer vagina would make women more attractive to men. In Thailand, however, the companies responsible say they have been successful. &quot;Products [have] evolved from face-whitening to body and deodorant solutions to even out dark areas in the armpits,&quot; said Louis-Sebastien Ohl of Publicis Thailand, which created the adverts. &quot;Now an intimate toiletry also offers a whitening benefit, because research evidenced that \u2026 women [are] keen to have such a product.&quot; In many countries across south-east Asia, fairer skin is equated with higher class as it suggests a life not spent toiling in rice paddies under the sun. The Thai language is peppered with expressions that denigrate dark skin, such as the insult dam mhuen e-ga \u2013 &quot;black like a crow&quot;. These days, rice farmers wear long sleeves, trousers, wide-brimmed hats and gloves. According to DRAFTFCB, the agency behind many of Nivea&apos;s skin-lightening ads in Thailand, such labourers make up much of of the Thai market for Nivea&apos;s face- and body-lightening products. Using pale Korean and Japanese pop stars as illustrations, Thai women&apos;s magazines are full of fair-skinned Asians promoting products that promise to whiten, lighten and &quot;boost&quot; the complexion, with slogans such as &quot;Show off your aura&quot; and &quot;Get to know the miracle of white skin&quot;. Fair-skinned actors and singers dominate the media nearly all over the Asia-Pacific region, where the skin-lightening industry is expected to reach $2bn this year , with the fastest growing markets in China and India. But the trend has been associated with health risks as many products contain ingredients such as hydroquinone and mercury, which can lead to permanent skin discolouration or kidney damage. Some products are illegal. There is no suggestion that Lactacyd White Intimate or Nivea products are illegal or contain hydroquinone or mercury. Critics of the whitening trend, such as Kultida Samabuddhi of the Bangkok Post, who wrote an opinion piece on the whitening feminine wash, say such products have changed the country&apos;s value system. &quot;As the definition of beauty has been changed by cosmetic industry, Thai women who fail to meet the beauty standards set by cosmetic producers and ad agencies have to struggle very hard to maintain their self-esteem,&quot; she told the Guardian. But the skin-whitening craze looks set to continue. The male market is yet to be fully tapped, said Ohl, who added that future variants of Lactacyd White Intimate would be formulated to include anti-ageing properties, &quot;so you can keep intimate parts fresh and young&quot; as well.", "publicationDate": "2012-09-23T14:06:20Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Race issues", "Beauty", "Fashion", "Skincare"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/23/thailand-vaginal-whitening-wash", "title": "Thailand's skin-whitening craze reaches woman's intimate areas", "sentences": ["Critics of the whitening trend, such as Kultida Samabuddhi of the Bangkok Post, who wrote an opinion piece on the whitening feminine wash, say such products have changed the country&apos;s value system."]}, {"article": "Escapism In Puducherry (formerly Pondicherry) in south-east India, a new hotel, Pondy 2, reflects the city&apos;s French colonial heritage.

Over simple acoustic strumming \u2013\u00a0think Mull of Kintyre with a higher tempo and fewer bagpipes \u2013 he sang: &quot;Oh how I yearn to be home again... we&apos;ll sit by the fireside and sing, we&apos;ll walk down a country lane on Sunday morning.&quot;  Keegan has always been a patriot, but his romanticised view of England has not always caught the imagination of those around him. His paean to the nation failed to chart and he ended his international career on a Wembley toilet. Keegan resigned from the role of England manager 12 years ago this week. His team had played poorly at Euro 2000 and were then beaten at home to Germany in the last game at the old Wembley. They lost to a single Dietmar Hamman goal \u2013\u00a0a free-kick from well outside the box that should have been saved by David Seaman. David Davies tells the story of what happened after the match in his diary, FA Confidential:  The old Wembley closed down in humiliation. Even the heavens wept for England. But no one at the FA could have predicted what happened next. On entering the dressing room, I couldn&apos;t believe the scene. Steam poured out of the showers, making it difficult to see who was where, but I glimpsed Kevin in one corner. Tony Adams, David Beckham and other players sat around in various states of undress. &apos;David, you tell him not to do it,&apos; shouted Tony, who was completely fired up. &apos;David, he&apos;ll listen to you,&apos; pleaded Becks, who was in tears. &apos;What?&apos; &apos;Talk to him,&apos; Tony said. &apos;Who?&apos; &apos;Kevin!&apos; Tony and David both yelled. They didn&apos;t need to tell me what Kevin had done. He&apos;d thrown in the towel. I knew it. I looked at Kevin.  &apos;Don&apos;t leave. You have to stay.&apos; &apos;No, no, no,&apos; Kevin replied. &apos;I&apos;m off. I&apos;m not for this.&apos; &apos;This isn&apos;t happening,&apos; I thought. I wasn&apos;t prepared mentally for such a situation. Think fast. Calm things down. Lock away the emotions. Shift into work mode. &apos;Come on, let&apos;s go,&apos; said Kevin, &apos;I&apos;m ready to face the press.&apos; &apos;No, you&apos;re bloody not. We&apos;re having a talk before you go anywhere near the press.&apos;  Where on earth could we find that was private? The tunnel? Crawling with television reporters. The dressing room? Heaving with emotional players. The bath area? I couldn&apos;t hold a vital conversation with an England manager as players dived into the water. Only one option presented itself. The toilet cubicles. A dramatic moment in England&apos;s long football history occurred in the ancient loos of a stadium facing demolition. The impending destruction could almost be smelled in the air.  Dragging Kevin into a cubicle, I shut the door behind us. We stood there, facing each other. &apos;You can&apos;t change my mind,&apos; Kevin said. &apos;I&apos;m out of here. I&apos;m not up to it. I&apos;m going out to the press to tell them I&apos;m not up to it. I can&apos;t motivate the players. I can&apos;t get the extra bit out of these players that I need.&apos;   King Kevin abdicates again: Where now for England? David Lacey, writing a few days after Keegan&apos;s resignation, summed up the predicament facing the FA: Of the 10 men who have been in charge of the England football team over the past 54 years, Kevin Keegan will be remembered as a cheerleader who denied Wembley one last hurrah and then quit while he was behind. Keegan&apos;s sudden resignation five minutes after his team had lost Saturday&apos;s World Cup qualifier 1-0 to Germany concludes the most bizarre period yet in the quirky history of national managers. The England coach had taken over 20 months ago after the Football Association&apos;s decision to sack Glenn Hoddle once the prime minister, put on the spot in a day-time television chat show, had muttered that if Hoddle really had implied the disabled were paying for the sins of past lives he ought to go. In view of what has happened now Hoddle might have been referring to the FA international committee, for if ever a body is reaping the whirlwind of past misdeeds it is surely this one. Bobby Robson took England to the semi-finals of the 1990 World Cup but his contract was not renewed, Terry Venables had already decided not to sign a fresh contract by the time England reached the last four of Euro 96, the committee having expressed doubts about his legal wrangles with Alan Sugar and the Department of Trade and Industry, and Hoddle&apos;s sin was to express his beliefs clumsily to a national newspaper. The timing of Keegan&apos;s departure was totally predictable. His temperament and lack of tactical nous made him a bad choice from the start. When he originally agreed to take the job for four matches, while remaining manager of Fulham, he promised that the players would sing the national anthem with passion and bring a similar mood to their performances. Well, not all of the team were singing before Saturday&apos;s match and not enough of them were in harmony during the game to form a barbershop quartet. Keegan also stressed that he would not leave Fulham once his four-match stint had ended. After two games in charge, however, he decided that &quot;it&apos;s time to stop playing games: I want the job&quot;. On Saturday he again decided it was time to stop playing games, only now he believed he was not up to the job after all. In other words, after taking the England post saying I&apos;m sorry I&apos;ll read that again, he has abandoned it admitting I&apos;m sorry I haven&apos;t a clue. Keegan&apos;s plea of mea culpa \u2013 &quot;I&apos;m blaming nobody but myself. I wasn&apos;t good enough&quot; \u2013 the revelation that during England&apos;s awful first half that he did not know what to do, his apparent self-sacrifice in order to hand the squad over to someone with more knowledge and the hardly original thought that he wants to spend more time with his family will cut little ice with experienced Kev-watchers. He has walked out after a defeat that made it imperative that he stayed for at least four more days in order to give England the best chance of repairing the damage, serious though hardly mortal, to their chances of qualifying for the World Cup caused by an initial home defeat. Instead of which Howard Wilkinson, the FA&apos;s technical director, will again pop up like George, the inflatable automatic pilot in Airplane, to take over the team for Wednesday&apos;s qualifier in Finland. When Don Revie quit on England during a World Cup qualifying campaign the FA tried, unsuccessfully, to ban him from football for 10 years. True, Keegan did not conduct covert negotiations with the United Arab Emirates before giving his resignation exclusively to a newspaper, but his defection is scarcely more admirable. If, as he insists, he enjoyed the full support of everybody at the FA from the chairman to the Lancaster Gate cat then surely he could have given the job one more chance. Keegan&apos;s excuse that the fans who clamoured successfully for his appointment had helped him make up his mind on Saturday by booing him as he left the arena is barely worth consideration. If every England manager had walked out after being jeered at Wembley Alf Ramsey, Ron Greenwood, Bobby Robson, Graham Taylor and Glenn Hoddle would not have lasted anywhere near as long as they did. According to Adam Crozier, the FA&apos;s chief executive who has limited experience of these things: &quot;It is never easy to say I&apos;m not going to be England coach any more. To walk away from that is a very courageous thing to do.&quot; Yet surely it would have been even more courageous to stay put, tough it out, and risk the probability of being ditched by the FA if the team also lost in Helsinki. It is not as if Keegan had a rough ride from the media, who let him down relatively lightly after the debacle of Euro 2000. He was never vilified in the press as Robson was more than once. He was never lampooned as cruelly as Taylor nor hung out to dry like Hoddle. The heat in Keegan&apos;s kitchen barely rose above gas mark one. Crozier was nearer the mark, albeit unwittingly,when he observed that &quot;I think Kevin Keegan knew he was making the right decision for Kevin Keegan &quot;. That is surely the point. On Saturday Keegan made all the right self-deprecatory noises in the interviews. He is a master of the soundbite and it is a pity that his tactical know-how in handling reporters&apos; questions was not matched by an ability to organise the England team. &quot;I just feel that for Kevin Keegan there is nothing more in football I want to do,&quot; he said a trifle wistfully. Presumably this precludes returning to TV as a soccer pundit. Surely he can never sit in judgment on England again having admitted that he did not know enough when he was in charge. The aftermath Tony Banks, the former Sports Minister who led England&apos;s failed bid for the 2006 World Cup, blamed &quot;half-arsed journalists&quot; and the &quot;self-appointed experts&quot; in the crowd who had jeered Keegan. But the manager admitted he had not been up to the job: &quot;I just don&apos;t feel I can find that little bit extra you need at this level to find a winning formula. I just feel I have given it my best shot. I don&apos;t want to outstay my welcome.&quot; Keegan later admitted that he had not enjoyed his time as England manager: &quot;I found it soulless. I found it hard to fill in the time. I found myself going and training the blind team, the deaf team, working with the ladies team. It&apos;s a very difficult job.&quot; The replacement When it came to replacing Keegan, there was a dearth of English candidates. Peter Taylor took over the job as caretaker for a single defeat to Italy, but was never really in contention. In a typical bout of doublespeak, Harry Redknapp distanced himself from the position: &quot;I cannot think of a worse job. Whoever takes it, three or four months down the line will be getting abused. The simple truth is, no matter what side you pick, we don&apos;t seem to look good enough. I cannot think of a worse job.&quot; Terry Venables wasn&apos;t optimistic about his chances: &quot;It&apos;s well documented that the FA didn&apos;t want to go back before Kevin took the job, which meant going back to me, so I think that rules me out.&quot; Writing in the Guardian, Ron Atkinson decried Roy Hodgson&apos;s chances: &quot;I don&apos;t want to decry Roy because he has worked very hard to get where he is, but we are talking about the England national job here. Someone who has been as successful as him in Switzerland is Christian Gross, but would anybody be touting him as Kevin Keegan &apos;s successor?&quot;  Howard Wilkinson was given this assessment by one Guardian writer: &quot;Motivational skills: None, unless you are a believer in gobbledegook. Tactical awareness: Great if you like the ball hoofed higher than a sponsor&apos;s blimp. Temperament: Drone, drone, drone (think William Hague). Verdict: Would be totally outclassed.&quot; When the merits of foreign coaches were condsidered, the Guardian leader warned applicants to be wary of the Sun. Perhaps Sven G\u00f6ran-Eriksson would have preferred a heads-up about their sister paper, the News of the World:  To judge from the views which have poured into websites, most fans believe there are only two options for filling the vacancy. First: Terry Venables second: someone else. Someone else, this time, might not be English. One ingenious pundit says the FA should go back to Fulham, where they found Mr Keegan, and hire his French successor, Jean Tigana.  Stuffy old cricket dared to do it, engaging the Zimbabwean Duncan Fletcher, and last season&apos;s performance suggests it may have paid off. Yet any foreign import who takes the job will need to be a stupendous success, since otherwise the sort of obloquy which came the way of Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle and others will break out all over again, but this time with added xenophobia. Even the Sun, contenders should be aware, knows the French for &quot;turnip&quot;.  In the end, Sven Goran-Eriksson took the job and became the first foreigner to manage England. He is now the technical director of BEC Tero Sasana FC in Bangkok, Thailand. Contrary to the reasoning of David Lacey, Keegan is now a pundit. He can be found delivering &quot;Keeganisms&quot; on ESPN and even made his way back to ITV, the scene of his most foolish prediction, for the World Cup in 2010.  Earlier this year, the interview in which Keegan said he would &quot;love it&quot; if Newcastle beat Manchester United to the Premier League title was voted the most memorable quote in Premier League history.

A few days past his 27th birthday, the fledgling Danish director had been brought to Britain to promote his first film, a low-budget crime drama called Pusher. &quot;It was a glorious moment,&quot; he recalls. &quot;The film had done more than I ever thought it could \u2013 it had left Copenhagen. For me that was like making Star Wars.&quot; Fifteen years on, he sits in another, larger Soho hotel \u2013 a sleek and genial figure whose last film, the neon-lit thriller Drive, carried him into Hollywood&apos;s upper levels. A London-set remake of his debut is about to be released, on which his credit is executive producer. He is here to reminisce. To walk between the two hotels would take minutes, yet the journey from one to the other has been outlandish \u2013 an odyssey through the film industries of Britain, the US and Scandinavia with a detour to India and a baroque cast of real-life characters. The new Pusher is, in fact, a second remake, joining a pair of sequels Refn made himself in what must surely be modern cinema&apos;s most unlikely franchise. The original plot was classically simple, a seven-day countdown as a Copenhagen heroin dealer tries to settle a debt to a louche but vicious Serbian gangster. Refn&apos;s gift for casting was clear \u2013 the burly Kim Bodnia gave anti-hero Frank a glowering magnetism, the much-admired Mads Mikkelsen took a first screen role as his sidekick. The result hummed with promise \u2013 the son of Danish film-makers who spent his youth in 80s New York, Refn instinctively fused the swagger of American crime movies with handheld European v\u00e9rit\u00e9. In Denmark, the film was a huge and unexpected hit. The rest of the world failed to notice. It took British distributor Metrodome to brave a first international release. In the last moments before Trainspotting became old news, company founder Rupert Preston cannily sold Refn as &quot;the Danish Danny Boyle&quot; and the film won an audience big enough to stir interest elsewhere. &quot;Britain is where it all started,&quot; Refn says. &quot;This place got me out of my cage.&quot; For its director, Pusher had served its purpose: he came to see the movie as a film student might regard their final coursework, with fond memories of a riotous shoot, a supporting cast of club kids and local heavies, and a snotty commitment to authenticity that meant &quot;all the cocaine on set being real&quot;. Assuming all that was now behind him, Refn got on with the rest of his career. Eventually, inevitably, he headed to the US. In 2003 came a wilfully opaque thriller called Fear X, starring John Turturro. It baffled almost all who saw it. All, essentially, was no one. Its director was left financially ruined. &quot;I was down and out,&quot; Refn says. &quot;I owed the bank a million dollars. I was depressed, humiliated, I had just had my first child. I felt like a rock&apos;n&apos;roll suicide.&quot; If the scale of his debt outdid Frank in Pusher, there was a mordant irony to the solution \u2013 the &quot;despicable sell-out&quot; of making not one but two belated sequels. He had few other offers. In Pusher II \u2013 Refn now calls it &quot;the girly Pusher&quot; \u2013 Mikkelsen&apos;s goonish sadsack attempted fatherhood. Pusher III focused on Milo, the ageing gangster again played by Zlatko Buric, a crazy-haired 6ft 5in Croatian steeped in avant-garde theatre who had stolen much of the first movie. Yet there would be a twist. Born as desperate cash-ins, the sequels won Refn new levels of critical acclaim. They also made just enough money to pay off the bank. An unhappy spell making Miss Marple TV movies still lay ahead. But old friendships endured. Preston had by now left Metrodome for Vertigo Films, a hard-nosed outfit whose movies were keenly attuned to the market. Having produced Refn&apos;s Pusher sequels, he now suggested a remake. Given the original&apos;s strong characters and ticking-clock conceit, he wasn&apos;t the first. A script appeared from an American producer. Fox discussed making a network TV show. Given the nature of Refn&apos;s career, it was therefore predictable that the first remake of Pusher would be developed in Leicester and shot in Hindi. A cheerful Anglo-Indian actor from the east Midlands, Assad Raja had nursed a passion for the film since 1997. Finally, after years telling friends he wanted to make a film &quot;a bit like Pusher&quot; to escape the weary chase for roles on The Bill, he approached Refn for the rights to direct a fully fledged remake \u2013 a showcase for his talents aimed at the Indian film business. Refn, says Raja, was &quot;amused&quot; by the thought of his debut going Bollywood. Casting himself in the lead and shooting in London, his production was almost as chaotic as the original: unable to find an Asian actor to play a henchman, Raja narrowly avoided having to &quot;brown up&quot; a white bodybuilder. In the end, his film came out in 2010 sharing the same scruffy, adrenal energy as its inspiration while adding a\u00a0sub-plot about the cricket world cup. India, to Raja&apos;s disappointment, was unmoved. At home, too, while the film found a fanbase on DVD, not everyone saw the commercial potential. In the meantime, Refn had agreed to Preston&apos;s idea of their own remake, set in London. It would be a mistake to see him as an innocent among moneymen. By his own account, his career began at 21, when his uncle \u2013 then owner of Denmark&apos;s biggest arthouse distributor \u2013 recruited him to scout for films at Cannes. &quot;That was my education,&quot; he says. &quot;I never approached film-making as an art. I saw it as what sells.&quot; For most of the remake&apos;s production, he was in Bangkok making his next film, cop thriller Only God Forgives. But his involvement went much further than the executive producer&apos;s typical role of turning up for the premiere. The choice of writer \u2013 former TV producer Matthew Read \u2013 was his. He and Preston together picked director Luis Prieto, a Spanish maker of Italian romantic comedies. The budget was set at $1m (\u00a3623,000) \u2013 a sum Preston says ensured fidelity to the tone of the original, but which must also have relaxed the accountants.     Kim Bodnia as Frank in Nicolas Winding Refn's original Pusher. Photograph: The Ronald Grant Archive    Fighting jetlag in an east London bar, Prieto describes Refn&apos;s role in the new Pusher as &quot;like God \u2013 usually invisible, but always there&quot;. Casting decisions, he says, were collaborative \u2013 hiring ex-model Agyness Deyn as Frank&apos;s stripper girlfriend Flo was an idea put to him by the producers, but one he gladly accepted. Once he did, he insisted neither she nor co-star Richard Coyle should watch the original film, ensuring the only principal actor who had seen it had also starred in it \u2013 Buric, returning as Milo after coaxing from Refn. Prieto says he made his movie with two goals \u2013 to create something more stylised than the original and to foreground the character of Flo. On those terms, he succeeds. Deyn is a vivid presence, while $1m buys you a lot of slickness in 2012. And if the remake does sometimes make you pine for the Pusher you saw back in 1997, the truth \u2013 expressed politely but without apology by all concerned \u2013 is that it&apos;s not really for you: &quot;Luis&apos;s version is for a new audience,&quot; Preston says. &quot;So many people won&apos;t have seen the original. If you&apos;re 20 now, you were five when it came out.&quot; Similarly, if there were fears that setting Pusher in London might taint the film with geezerism, in fact the remake feels strikingly little like London. Shot in Stoke Newington, the standard-issue urban backdrops could often be anywhere. For Preston, hiring a director with no connection to the capital was deliberate \u2013 the result of a desire not to make &quot;one of those British crime movies we see too often&quot;. But in a global film market there may be other benefits \u2013 giving an international audience the hint of local flavour without enough of it to scare them off. This way, it seems, lies the future. Because rather than their remake ending the Pusher story, Refn and Preston see it as the start of a new chapter \u2013 or chapters. A working model is ready to go \u2013 Refn matching up a character, a city and a skeletal story, before the two men then find writers and directors to make the movie. So next will be a sequel to the remake \u2013 not, to be clear, a remake of the sequel \u2013 following Deyn as Flo to a new life in Las Vegas. Then it will once more be the turn of the tireless Buric, though Refn is unsure where to put him: &quot;Zlatko could go anywhere. Maybe Tokyo.&quot; Asked how many Pushers he might ultimately father, he pauses. &quot;At one point I wanted to do 10,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ll keep going until the ideas run out.&quot; He sips his cappuccino. &quot;So far they never have.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-10-11T19:00:01Z", "tags": ["Film", "Nicolas Winding Refn", "Agyness Deyn", "Crime", "Bollywood", "Drama", "Culture", "Television & radio"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/11/pusher-remake-nicolas-winding-refn", "title": "Pusher returns \u2013 again", "sentences": ["I saw it as what sells.&quot; For most of the remake&apos;s production, he was in Bangkok making his next film, cop thriller Only God Forgives."]}, {"article": "1) That was the season that was \u2026 Not the best, arguably the worst for a while, but will be remembered much more positively thanks mainly to Leeds. Their achievement in winning a fifth Super League title in six years, having finished fifth in the table for the second season running, takes the Rhinos into the sort of territory previously occupied by Wigan in the first half of the 1990s. Obviously they haven&apos;t been as dominant as those Wigan teams coached by John Monie that achieved four consecutive league and cup doubles between September 1989 and May 1993. But then again that was before Sky&apos;s money funded a full-time Super League, and the introduction of a salary cap which is supposed to ensure a more even spread of talent, and trophies. Little more than a week after the Grand Final, the dust is already settling on the 2012 season. The year Paul Wood dropped a bollock (or rather ruptured one, played on, and conducted one last interview with Ray French for BBC Radio Merseyside before heading off to have it removed). The year James Graham drew blood from Billy Slater&apos;s ear in the National Rugby League Grand Final \u2013 leaving the Scouse prop needing to achieve the sort of personal rehabilitation that Joel Monaghan has managed these last couple of years with Warrington. The support of Mike Tyson was probably the last thing Graham would have wanted, as he continues to protest his innocence of biting, for which he has nevertheless received a lengthy suspension. The year St Helens moved to a smart new stadium at Langtree Park but suffered more memorable defeats there \u2013 to Daryl Millard&apos;s dramatic try for the Catalan Dragons, to Wigan on Good Friday, to Warrington in the play-offs \u2013 than they recorded notable wins. (Only the thrashing of a Leeds team who had dyed their hair red for Comic Relief would come into the latter category. But for what it&apos;s worth, I fancy Saints to return to either Wembley, Old Trafford or both in 2013, following the appointment of Nathan Brown as coach, and the recruitment of Willie Manu from Hull.) The year Brett Hodgson rose from the canvas to lead Warrington to a third Wembley win in four years \u2013 condemning Leeds to their third consecutive cup final defeat. But the Rhinos, who had started the season by beating Manly in a rousing World Club Challenge at Headingley with a stirring team performance in which Ryan Hall and Jamie Peacock were outstanding, bounced back to end it in even more satisfying fashion. With apologies to Doncaster and Sheffield Eagles, who won the Championship Grand Finals to provide the rugby league battlers of South Yorkshire with their greatest day since the Eagles stunned Wigan at Wembley in 1998, 2012 will be remembered most of all as the year of the Rhinos, and of their outstanding captain Kevin Sinfield. His leadership has been a constant through the six titles Leeds have won since 2004 in the most successful era in the history of the Headingley club, but this felt like a more personal triumph than any other. That&apos;s partly because it has been followed by his appointment as the national captain, for the forthcoming European Championship matches against Wales and France, and hopefully into next year&apos;s World Cup. But the Leeds coach Brian McDermott argued that Sinfield had also lifted himself to fresh peaks of performance during the play-offs, not only by landing 21 goals from as many attempts, but also by dragging his team through tough away games in Perpignan and Wigan. 2) \u2026 but it&apos;s not quite over yet This is supposed to be a short off-season Set of Six, so a quick rattle through some other topics. The northern hemisphere autumn, or southern hemisphere spring, means internationals in rugby league. This is a disappointingly thin year, but there were a couple of contrasting games at the weekend. Australia beat New Zealand in what sounds like a decent occasion and an encouragingly competitive match in Townsville. At the other end of the scale, Ireland recorded an impressive victory over Scotland in front of 766 in Edinburgh. We shouldn&apos;t get too hung up on crowds \u2013 Edinburgh&apos;s rugby union team only managed 6,000 for a Heineken Cup game against Saracens at Murrayfield the previous day. But it&apos;s still disappointing that the excellent grassroots work going on in Scotland isn&apos;t receiving much support. It does seem ridiculous, despite that three-figure gate, that Scotland will play in Workington and Salford, but not Glasgow or Edinburgh, in the World Cup next year. 3) No Badger cull in Thailand Next weekend it&apos;s on to Belfast, where Mark Aston&apos;s Ireland team face the England Knights; to Lens, where France play Wales in the first match of the European Championship; and to Bangkok, where Thailand play the Philippines in a game that would already have broken new ground for league, even before it became surely the first international in any sport to be refereed by a husband and wife. Gavin Badger is an established NRL official, and Kasey, who met him through refereeing, has already made history by taking control of a Toyota Cup under-20s match. &quot;If I think he&apos;s done something wrong, he&apos;ll be able to tell by the way I glare at him&quot;, Kasey has joked. 4) Another unlikely Oxtail No sport does surreal quite like rugby league. From the husband and wife refereeing team called Mr and Mrs Badger, to the cans of soup named after a Wigan and England full-back \u2013 Beef, Tomkins and Onion flavour. But this is for a worthy cause, the Joining Jack appeal raising funds for research into Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Anyone tried the soup yet? 5) Bulls building From Beef and Tomkins to the Bulls, and plenty has happened at Odsal in the long break since the last Set of Six. The food theme continues, as they&apos;ve been taken over by Omar Khan, a restaurant owner from Bradford, and despite the inevitable exodus of players, the club seem to be rebuilding intelligently following the appointment of Francis Cummins as coach. Retaining the gifted young forward John Bateman and the former London playmaker Luke Gale are two statements of intent, suggesting that Bradford will at least be capable of competing next season with the other Super League clubs who have fallen on hard times \u2013 Salford, Castleford and Hull KR. Their struggles provide a real opportunity for the likes of Widnes and London Broncos to surge up the table in 2013, and for Wakefield Trinity to consolidate the excellent season they enjoyed in 2012. But all that&apos;s a long way away for the moment. 6) Don&apos;t forget Finally, a quick word for State of Mind, the mental health charity for rugby league that was formed in response to the death of Terry Newton two years ago, and even made it to Channel 4 News this year. It continues to work closely with the 1eagu3 (League 13) players&apos; association that was formed last year, with the results of its latest survey expected soon.", "publicationDate": "2012-10-15T13:40:34Z", "tags": ["Leeds Rhinos", "Super League XVII", "Super League", "Rugby league", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/oct/15/super-league-set-of-six-leeds", "title": "Super League Set of Six: Season saved by Leeds and heroic Kevin Sinfield | Andy Wilson", "sentences": ["3) No Badger cull in Thailand Next weekend it&apos;s on to Belfast, where Mark Aston&apos;s Ireland team face the England Knights; to Lens, where France play Wales in the first match of the European Championship; and to Bangkok, where Thailand play the Philippines in a game that would already have broken new ground for league, even before it became surely the first international in any sport to be refereed by a husband and wife."]}, {"article": "A Briton jailed for embezzlement in Dubai claims the Foreign Office is failing to protect British nationals from unfair extradition to the United Arab Emirates. Michael Smith, 45, is serving six years in prison after being convicted of embezzling the equivalent of $600,000 (\u00a3370,000) from a Dubai property developer following his extradition from Thailand. Smith claims he was misled into dropping his appeal against extradition after documents to the Bangkok court from the UAE embassy in Thailand stated he faced a maximum three-year sentence. Instead, he was sentenced to 12 years \u2013 since halved on appeal \u2013 after the Dubai court found him guilty. Smith told the Guardian he was on hunger strike \u2013 refusing solid food and only taking liquids \u2013 in protest and to draw attention to his treatment to warn others who might be similarly misled. He was convicted this year of forging salary transfers to 13 fake employees while working as HR manager at Limitless, a property developer subsidiary of Dubai World, where he was said to have been employed after using forged university degrees. Smith, originally from Feltham, Middlesex, was arrested eight months after fleeing Dubai when an international search tracked him to Bangkok. He spent two years in a Thai prison fighting extradition before agreeing to return to Dubai believing the maximum sentence he faced was three years, he said. &quot;It surely cannot be right that a sovereign government (UAE) extradited me without a treaty on the basis of incorrect information provided to another government, and then my own government refuses to protest,&quot; said Smith, who is in prison in Al Aweer. &quot;I gave up legal appeals because the maximum sentence stated during the extradition process was three years, and the extradition process would take up to four years. And I had already spent two years on remand in Thailand awaiting extradition, which they are not taking into account. &quot;Do you seriously think the British government would not protest if a government misled them on another issue? But because I am an individual, it is just accepted. &quot;I want the UAE to abide by its written request to Thailand, which states that I faced three years in jail. I want them to recognise the 747 days I spent on remand in Thailand, as is normal under extradition law. &quot;And I want the British government to do their job, which is to assist governments ensuring wanted British citizens face justice, but also protecting them from abuses and not hiding behind a policy of non-interference. &quot;I also want others facing the possibility of extradition to the UAE to be able to use my case as a precedent so that their lawyers can point to the UAE as not abiding by international and providing false extradition requests.&quot; There was no response to inquiries made to the Dubai or UAE authorities. A Foreign Office spokesman said: &quot;We are aware of the detention of Michael Smith in Dubai and continue to provide him with consular assistance since his extradition from Thailand to Dubai last year. We also continue to closely monitor Mr Smith&apos;s welfare and should any concerns for his welfare be raised, we can and will contact the authorities about this. &quot;As neither consular staff at the FCO nor the British embassy in Dubai are legally trained, we are unable to comment on Mr Smith&apos;s case in Dubai or his extradition from Thailand. It is not our role to provide legal advice, and we did not do so in this case. A lawyer would be best placed to advice Mr Smith with regard to these issues.&quot; A spokesman for Fair Trials International said: &quot;The UAE&apos;s criminal justice system is no stranger to criticism about its failure to protect even the most basic fair trial rights. Beneath the glitz and glamour of Dubai&apos;s shining skyscrapers lies a series of harsh laws, poor prison conditions and disregard for the rule of law.&quot; Smith is wanted in Britain on deception and theft charges. He was committed for trial on six charges of obtaining a total of \u00a317,450 by deception from banks in 1997 and 1998, and the theft of \u00a318,965 from a bank in 1996, but failed to attend Teesside crown court for his hearing in February 1999. A CPS spokesman said: &quot;The charges against Michael Smith have been allowed to lie on file as his return to this country in the foreseeable future is very unlikely.

The\u00a0title role of the sexually adventurous housewife in Emmanuelle (1974) became a\u00a0reference for every part she played subsequently. This was not surprising, as the Dutch star did play a character called Emmanuelle, with few variations, many times over. In the original film, Kristel portrayed the bored wife of a French embassy official in Bangkok, urged by her libertine husband to explore all the possibilities of sex. Thereupon, she finds herself in bed with, among others, a lesbian archaeologist and an elderly rou\u00e9. Directed with some grace by Just Jaeckin, this glossy soft-porn package, dressed up as art-house erotica, was a huge international hit, becoming the first X-rated film to be released in the US. Lushly photographed and with a\u00a0certain level of character development, its appeal went beyond the raincoat brigade. The success was also put down to Kristel&apos;s underestimated performance. According to the critic Roger Ebert: &quot;She projects a certain vulnerability that makes several of the scenes work. The performers in most skin-flicks seem so impervious to ordinary mortal failings, so blas\u00e9 in the face of the most outrageous sexual invention, that finally they just become cartoon characters. Kristel actually seems to be present in the film, and as absorbed in its revelations as we are.&quot; Her performances in several other films, with directors including Walerian Borowczyk, Claude Chabrol, Roger Vadim and Alain Robbe-Grillet, proved that she was worthy of\u00a0better than most of the quickie tosh in\u00a0which she appeared. She was born in Utrecht, Netherlands, where her parents ran a hotel. In her 2006 autobiography, Undressing Emmanuelle, she recalls how she was sexually abused aged nine by an elderly guest at the hotel. Her alcoholic parents divorced when she was 14 after her father left home for another woman. Two years later, he returned with the woman, kicking his wife, Sylvia and her sister out of the house. After a convent school education, Kristel became a photographic model, with a lack of inhibition that landed her role in Emmanuelle \u2013 soon followed by Emmanuelle 2 (1975), in which the scene has shifted to Hong Kong, though this is\u00a0hardly noticeable, because most of the action is in soft-focus close-ups. Kristel again disrobes elegantly and supplies the endless round of sexual encounters with a modicum of tasteful eroticism. The last of the trilogy, set in the Seychelles, was mistitled Goodbye Emmanuelle (1977), because Kristel would appear again in two more features and seven TV films as the older Emmanuelle, usually instructing a\u00a0younger version of herself in the art of\u00a0seduction. In between, her reputation was being exploited by the eccentric French director Jean-Pierre Mocky, who got her to swim naked in No Pockets in a Shroud (1974), and she played a\u00a0prostitute in Robbe-Grillet&apos;s Playing with Fire (1975). In Vadim&apos;s A Faithful Wife (Une Femme Fid\u00e8le, 1976), set during the 19th century, Kristel was allowed to keep her beautiful costumes on most of the time. Her favourite film was Borowczyk&apos;s The Streetwalker (La Marge, 1976), in\u00a0which she is touching as a mysterious and proud prostitute who has an affair with a happily married man (Joe Dallesandro). Alice or the Last Escapade (Alice ou la Derni\u00e8re Fugue, 1977) was a surprising departure into fantasy for Chabrol. In this homage to Lewis Carroll and &quot;old dark house&quot; movies, Kristel does her best with the passive character. As Maria Theresa, Kristel led a cast that included Ursula Andress, Cornel Wilde, Beau Bridges, Rex Harrison and Olivia de Havilland in The Fifth Musketeer (1979). During the shooting, Kristel and Ian McShane, who played the wily minister Fouquet, began a\u00a0highly publicised, five-year-long affair. It was among the few mainstream movies that Kristel made, another being The Concorde... Airport &apos;79 (1979) in\u00a0which she is a flight attendant who says to the captain (George Kennedy): &quot;You pilots are such... men,&quot; only to receive the reply: &quot;They don&apos;t call it the\u00a0cockpit for nothing, honey.&quot; She was soon back to roles that were expected of her, such as a soft-porn version of Lady Chatterley&apos;s Lover (1981), for which she was reunited with Jaeckin. In Private Lessons (1981), an\u00a0American film set in Arizona, she is a maid who sexually initiates a teenage boy. (She had a stand-in for the sex scenes.) It was a box-office smash, but Kristel got no share in the profits as she had unwisely sold her share in the production prior to its release. A success with the teen crowd was the broad US high-school farce Private School (1983), in which Kristel plays a sex education teacher called Ms\u00a0Regina Copoletta, an example of the level of its humour. In 1985 Kristel had the impossible task of competing with Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich and Jeanne Moreau as\u00a0Mata Hari, revealing much more than they did. Although she continued to be active, she was by then struggling with drugs and alcohol. A heavy smoker from\u00a0the age of 11, she was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2001, and then lung cancer. She survived to work again, directing a short animated film, Topor and Me (2004), which won an award at the Tribeca film festival in 2006. Two years ago, I attended the Pula festival in Croatia where she was invited for the showing of Two Sunny Days, a Croatian film in English, directed by Ognjen Svilicic, in which she appeared in a small but important role. I had the pleasure of sharing a car with her on a two-hour drive to Zagreb, during which she chatted cheerfully about her career. Kristel was married and divorced twice. She is survived by her partner, Peter Brul, and a son by the Belgian author Hugo Claus, a partner from the mid-1970s. \u2022 Sylvia Kristel, actor, born 28 September 1952; died 18 October 2012", "publicationDate": "2012-10-18T18:05:21Z", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Netherlands"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/18/sylvia-kristel", "title": "Sylvia Kristel obituary", "sentences": ["In the original film, Kristel portrayed the bored wife of a French embassy official in Bangkok, urged by her libertine husband to explore all the possibilities of sex."]}, {"article": "There is nothing unusual about a married couple from Sydney celebrating their second wedding anniversary with a trip to Bangkok. But it seems safe to assume that Gavin and Kasey Badger will become the first to do so by refereeing a rugby league international together, when they combine to take charge of the unlikely-sounding fixture between Thailand and the Philippines on Sunday. Gavin has been established for a while as one of the leading officials in the National Rugby League, earning him the sort of opprobrium in Sydney and Brisbane with which Premier League officials are wearily familiar. Badger&apos;s was already an interesting tale, as he is the only NRL full-time referee with an indigenous background, having grown up in the tough Redfern area to the south of Sydney&apos;s Central Station. But by marrying Kasey, a rising referee who is already the most successful female official in Australian rugby league history, he lifted the story to an irresistible level. Kasey, who grew up in the western suburb of Parramatta, is 15 years Gavin&apos;s junior at 25 but they will referee as equals when the national teams of Thailand and Philippines make their debuts at the Royal Police Stadium. &quot;It&apos;s exactly the same two-referee system that we&apos;ve been operating in the NRL for the last few years,&quot; Gavin Badger said. &quot;There&apos;s no number one and number two. We&apos;ll just swap and change throughout the game.&quot; &quot;The big difference is we won&apos;t have the same technology for communication that they have in the NRL,&quot; Kasey added. &quot;I guess that&apos;s where being husband and wife might come in handy. We know each other pretty well. If he does something I think is wrong, he&apos;ll be able to tell by the way I glare at him.&quot; Kasey Badger reports that the brutal world of the NRL has yet to experience a Keys and Gray moment. &quot;I haven&apos;t had any issues,&quot; she said, having made her debut in the developmental Toyota Cup competition earlier this year in a match at Manly, of all places. &quot;That&apos;s not to say I haven&apos;t taken any criticism, obviously. But that pretty much goes with being a referee.&quot; Gavin insists loyally that his spouse has the ability and authority to referee at the highest level \u2013 NRL matches and who knows, perhaps even in the State of Origin cauldron between Queensland and New South Wales. &quot;I might be a bit biased but I&apos;ve got no doubts,&quot; he said. &quot;I know better than anyone how much she puts into her refereeing.&quot; The next step must surely be a reality television programme, in the Badger Sydney sett. &quot;We don&apos;t just talk about rugby league,&quot; laughed Kasey. &quot;But sometimes there will be disagreements about decisions if we&apos;re sat at home watching a match. More than anything we&apos;re rugby league fans.&quot; Those winter nights must just fly by. &quot;That&apos;s what gave us the idea of refereeing together,&quot; Gavin said. &quot;I&apos;m an old school friend of Andrew Charles,\u00a0who&apos;s trying to get rugby league going here in Thailand, and when he asked me to referee this game, Kasey was always going to come but she was just going to be a touch judge. Then we got talking about the fact that we&apos;ve had two referees in the NRL this year, and it just seemed like a great opportunity for me and Kasey to referee together, which will be an interesting experience for us and an interesting story for the game.&quot; There is a serious side to the fixture \u2013 the NRL, buoyed by a huge new television deal with Channel Nine, is keen to reach into new markets, as it battles the growing domestic threat of Australian Rules. Manly and Canberra are expected to take their first-round fixture to China early next year.

She told him to get a real job, so even though he&apos;d loved fashion since he was five (&quot;The way clothes fitted on my body, the T-shirt colours I liked best&quot;), Panichgul went to study business. After university in Boston he worked in merchandising for J Crew and as a\u00a0writer and editor at Harper&apos;s Bazaar before he finally designed his first collection under the Thakoon moniker in 2004, when he was 29. The designs are the antithesis of Panichgul&apos;s caution and diligence. Thakoon is all about bright colours and bold patterns; lots and lots of beautiful, sexy dresses. It has the sort of extrovert femininity that could drown a girl, but which quickly garnered a loyal fan base among confident women. US Vogue&apos;s Anna Wintour took Panichgul under her rather intimidating but very influential wing. Thakoon then found international fame when Michelle Obama wore his kimono-style Radzimir dress to the Democratic National Convention in 2008, and the label&apos;s now a firm favourite with the likes of Charlize Theron, Marion Cotillard and Julianne Moore. Beneath the flamboyance of his designs lies a steady logic, though. Panichgul says that fashion is something basic, to be consumed, into which he injects an innate sense of beauty or excitement with colour and print. &quot;The dress is so efficient, it would be amazing if men could wear it. You put it on and you don&apos;t have to think of anything else other than your hair and shoes. A lot of women don&apos;t have time to think \u2013 they just want something that really works.&quot; Fashion is a hard industry, admits Panichgul.

The only mention came when Mitt Romney was listing Barack Obama&apos;s supposed lack of progress in his first term: &quot;Are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement?&quot; the Republican candidate asked. &quot;No. They haven&apos;t had talks in two years.&quot; The lack of discussion reflects an agenda that is changing, partly as a result of upheaval elsewhere in the region and partly as a result of conscious efforts by the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, to talk down the local conflict and talk up the threat from the Iranian nuclear programme. But it will deepen the disillusionment of many Palestinians with the commitment of the US to resolve the conflict, and perhaps increase their resolve to pursue alternative strategies, such as the bid for enhanced status at the United Nations. Harriet Sherwood in Jerusalem Iran The candidates restated long-held positions. Asked by the moderator, Bob Schieffer, whether an attack by Iran on Israel would be considered an attack on the US, both said they would stand by Israel. (The more pertinent question \u2013 what would be your response if Israel unilaterally launched an attack? \u2013 came later, and got no answer.) Obama highlighted the difference between his position and Romney&apos;s: &quot;The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that during the course of this campaign he has often talked as if we should take premature military action. I think that would be a mistake.&quot; Romney spoke of the need to tighten sanctions and take further steps to isolate the Iranian regime diplomatically. &quot;Of course, military action is a last resort,&quot; he said. &quot;It is something one would only consider if all of the other avenues had been tried to their full extent.&quot; In a cutting riposte, Obama said: &quot;There have been times, governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you would do the some things we did, but you&apos;d say them louder and somehow that that would make a difference.&quot; Volume, tone and perception count, of course. But on substance there may be little to choose between the two candidates. Harriet Sherwood China Romney renewed his pledge to label China a currency manipulator &quot;on day one&quot;, arguing that the US was losing a silent trade war with the world&apos;s second-largest economy. Overall, the Republican candidate took a milder stance towards Beijing, telling viewers on Tuesday night: &quot;We can be a partner with China; we don&apos;t have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form.&quot; But asked if he was formally accusing China of manipulating the yuan, and sparking a trade war, he replied: &quot;There&apos;s one going on right now, which we don&apos;t know about it. It&apos;s a silent one, and they&apos;re winning.&quot; &quot;We have to say to our friend in China \u2026 you can&apos;t keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, [and] counterfeiting our products [and] selling them around the world, even to the United States.&quot; The US has not labelled China a currency manipulator since 1994, though successive administrations have considered doing so. Some observers doubt whether Romney would actually follow through on his claims. Tania Branigan in Beijing Africa As expected, the 49 countries of sub-Saharan Africa hardly registered in the final US presidential debate. &quot;Africa&quot; came up only once, when Barack Obama said: &quot;Our alliances have never been stronger: in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel.&quot; The sole reference to South Africa was to the era of white-minority rule, two decades ago. It came when Mitt Romney said, of Iran: &quot;I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah[s] they are around the world, the same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa.&quot; There was also a brief mention of Somalia, when Obama remarked: &quot;We created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan.&quot; The US has carried out drone strikes, and provided equipment and training to the African Union peacekeeping force that drove al-Qaida-linked militants out of their strongholds in Somalia. At one point Romney noted: &quot;Mali has been taken over \u2013 the northern part of Mali \u2013 by al-Qaida-type individuals.&quot; But after four years in which a president whose father was Kenyan raised hopes but failed to set Africa alight, the slim pickings came as little surprise on a continent accustomed to being far down the global agenda. Daniel Silke, a political analyst based in Cape Town, South Africa, tweeted: &quot;#Africa barely exists in final #Obama #Romney Presidential debate last night.&quot; Another tweeter, named Bevan, posted: &quot;Africa only mentioned twice in whole debate (Obama/Romney),hope fellow Africans took note. Only Africans can n will develop Africa for all.&quot; Jacques Sibomana, an entrepreneur, tweeted: &quot;And Africa yet became a forgotten Continent during the debate #Romney and #Obama.&quot; Last week, two analysts, Witney Schneidman and Andrew Westbury, issued a plea for Schieffer to ask the candidates about Africa. They wrote: &quot;We urge you to use your privilege as moderator to direct the country&apos;s attention to a part of the world that has never been more important, but seemingly never so neglected as it concerns American foreign policy priorities: sub-Saharan Africa.&quot; It appears Schieffer failed to heed them. David Smith in Johannesburg Pakistan As with many other parts of the foreign policy debate, there was no daylight between the two candidates on Pakistan, with Mitt Romney using his time to try to demonstrate that he has some understanding of the country. He listed all the well-worn problems that, in the eyes of many US foreign policy experts, make Pakistan a troublesome country, albeit one the US can never afford to ignore. &quot;It is not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the road to double that at some point,&quot; Romney said. Repeated reference was made to Pakistan&apos;s nuclear stockpile, including to the prospect of the country, of 180 million people, one day having more nuclear weapons than Britain. He also noted the presence in Pakistan of the Haqqani network, an Afghan insurgent faction allied to the Taliban that has recently been designated a terrorist group by the US, and the threat that Taliban-sympathising ethnic Pashtuns in Pakistan may pose to Afghanistan after the end of the US combat mission, in 2014. He said: &quot;This is a nation which, if it becomes a failed state \u2026 there are nuclear weapons there, and you have terrorists that can grab those nuclear weapons.&quot; With the stakes so high, Romney was never going to forgo any tools for dealing with Pakistan, including the supposedly secret drone programme run by the CIA. Although the unmanned aircraft are a major source of friction between Pakistan and the US, Romney said the US must use &quot;any and all means necessary&quot; to target terrorists. &quot;I support that entirely, and feel the president was right to up the usage of that policy,&quot; he said. For his part, Obama simply let his record stand, using his time during the Afghanistan and Pakistan section to turn swiftly back to domestic policy, saying his strategy of building up the Afghan security forces would allow the US to divert resources to &quot;nation-building&quot; in the US. Jon Boone in Islamabad Russia Obama attempted to paint Romney as out of touch by recalling his Republican challenger&apos;s statement that Russia was the United States&apos;s &quot;number one political foe&quot;. He upped the ante a bit by saying Romney had called Russia the country&apos;s number one political &quot;threat&quot;. Romney corrected him on that later in the debate: the main threat, he insisted, was Iran. &quot;The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back,&quot; Obama said, recalling Romney&apos;s words. &quot;Because the cold war has been over for 20 years.&quot; That&apos;s what some Russians have been saying all along. Shortly after Romney made the statement, earlier this year, Dmitry Medvedev, Russia&apos;s prime minister, advised the candidates to &quot;check their clocks from time to time. It&apos;s 2012, not the mid-1970s.&quot; The hardliners inside Russia, including Vladimir Putin, instead welcomed the statement as &quot;blunt&quot; and &quot;straightforward&quot;. They are likely to do the same with the thoughts Romney aired during the debate. &quot;I&apos;m not going to wear rose-coloured glasses when it comes to Russia or Mr Putin,&quot; Romney said, noting that &quot;Russia does continue to battle us in the UN, time and time again&quot;. He also noted Moscow&apos;s recent withdrawal from the Nunn-Lugar agreement on arms clean-up as a sign of receding US influence in the world. With US-Russian relations spiralling to new post-cold war lows, it will be hard for Russia&apos;s leaders to disagree with any of that. Many will probably be happy simply to know that someone in Washington DC has noticed. Miriam Elder in Moscow Europe  &quot;Our alliances,&quot; said Obama, &quot;have never been stronger: in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel.&quot; And for Europeans, that was it. The sole reference to Europe in the debate was a perfunctory passing remark from the president; the word Europe did not cross the lips of Romney at all. There was no eurocrisis, despite the Obama administration&apos;s worries about how the sovereign debt troubles might affect his re-election prospects, and despite the transatlantic pressure, on the Germans especially, to get to grips with the crisis. Germany was not mentioned once, and France just once, along with Britain, in another throwaway remark, contrasting high US defence spending with the thriftiness of others. The special relationship? The UK warranted one further single mention, Romney simply noting that Pakistan will soon have more nuclear warheads than Britain. But failure to mention Europe may be just the way the Europeans want it. After talking to French and European diplomats, Lib\u00e9ration&apos;s Washington blog sensed they were OK with the fact that Europe had &quot;disappeared from America&apos;s radar&quot;, happy that Obama was not blaming the eurozone crisis as a source of US economic woe, and that Romney had stopped riffing on the dangers of &quot;European socialism&quot; (in other words, the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande). Both Le Point and Le Figaro felt that Romney had passed the test of leadership stature by keeping calm and succeeding in coming across as a plausible possible president. In a taster of its front-page editorial, Le Monde said: &quot;Point taken: foreign politics plays no role in the American election. On 6 November, voters will decide on one issue alone: the economy.&quot; Despite the irrelevance of Europe to the campaign, European elites are, of course, keenly watching the US election. Support for Obama is overwhelming, even if disappointment with the last four years is palpable; wariness of Romney is widespread. A BBC opinion poll released on Monday showed sweeping support in Europe for Obama, with France, perhaps surprisingly, returning stronger backing for the incumbent than anywhere else in the world, 72% to 2% for Romney. Two-thirds of British and Germans supported Obama, while Romney enjoyed 7% and 8% levels. The poll was conducted last month. Romney&apos;s highest European support came from Poland. But even that was a niggardly 16%, probably because of the Republican contender&apos;s relatively hard line on Russia. Ian Traynor in Brussels and Angelique Chrisafis in Paris Latin America It may be next door to the US with a population of 590 million people and some of the world&apos;s fastest growing economies, but Latin America barely received a mention during Monday night&apos;s debate. Obama failed to refer to anything on the continent south of the Rio Grande. Romney briefly accused the president of showing weakness towards Fidel Castro and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and failing to take better advantage of the trade opportunities in the region, but the total time devoted to Latin America in the 90-minute-long debate was about 20 seconds. The sense of rejection was evident in the regional and Hispanic media. &quot;Obama and Romney Don&apos;t Care About Latin America,&quot; said ABC-Univision, a major Spanish-language media group. Online commentators noted there was no mention of the drug war raging just across the Rio Grande in Mexico, insecurity in Central America, or free trade with Colombia. &quot;Nobody loves our Latin America very much,&quot; wrote Caio Binder, a correspondent for Brazil&apos;s Veja magazine. Binder said Romney also got his numbers wrong in his brief mention of the region. In a positive description of the trade opportunity that the US had so far failed to take advantage of, Romney said: &quot;As a matter of fact, Latin America&apos;s economy is almost as big as the economy of China. We&apos;re all focused on China. Latin America is a huge opportunity for us \u2013 time zone, language opportunities.&quot; Binder commented acidly: &quot;Wrong, governor: According to the IMF, the GDP of Latin America (and the Caribbean) in 2011 was $ 5.6tn, while that of China was $7.3tn.&quot; Nonetheless, he said Romney had scored a point among Latin American voters for at least mentioning the region. The lack of attention to the region may disappoint the 21 million eligible Hispanic voters in the US, who are seen as potential deciders in three swing states \u2013 Florida, Nevada and Colorado. In Florida, they are particularly strongly represented with 16% of eligible voters. Nationwide, polls suggest Obama has the support of about 65% support of this group, compared with 35% for Romney. In Florida they are almost level. But Romney&apos;s mentions of Ch\u00e1vez, Castro and trade prompted his supporters to claim he had made the case to Hispanic voters. &quot;I was very gratified that it was Mitt Romney who brought up Latin America, who talked of doing more trade with the region, and was the one who said we have issues in Venezuela, we have issues in Cuba,&quot; Hector Barreto, who chairs a Romney support group, told NBC. Obama&apos;s team claimed the president&apos;s actions spoke louder than his words. &quot;Two passing references to Latin America in a debate does not change the fundamentals of the president&apos;s record on Latin America: No president has visited the region more times, in his first four years in office, exports are up more than 50%, we have new free trade agreements with Colombia, and Panama, and all of that is a function of his leadership,&quot; said Dan Restrepo, who was the administration&apos;s top Latin America adviser. The oversight of Latin America was largely due to the moderator Bob Schieffer who choose not to raise related issues, such as regional diplomacy, trade, drug control and immigration. But language may also be a partial explanation. Although Romney talked of Latin America&apos;s &quot;language opportunities&quot; for the US and although most Hispanics in the US speak English, the two candidates were less enthused to raise Latin American issues in this debate in English compared to interviews they have given to the Spanish language media. Jonathan Watts in Rio de Janeiro Asia  Neither Obama nor Romney mentioned anywhere in Asia but China during the debate, despite the fact that America&apos;s presence in the region has involved a considerable number of south-east Asian nations in recent months, and that only looks set to increase. The US secretary of defence, Leon Panetta, visited Vietnam in June to promote greater ties between the former foes and stabilise a move whereby 60% of America&apos;s naval ships will be based in Asia Pacific by 2020. Then, last month in Jakarta, the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, encouraged a regionally unified code of conduct for the 10 members of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) in dealing with China over territorial disputes in the South China Sea (Clinton later went on to visit both Timor-Leste and Brunei). And in the US, Obama met Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, who was allowed for the first time in two decades to visit the US, and was awarded Congress&apos;s highest medal. That meeting was followed by the easing of many of the travel restrictions and sanctions against the former pariah nation, and, just last week, the US military&apos;s invitation to Burma to participate in a joint Thai-American military drill involving south-east and east Asian nations. That invitation was the US&apos;s first such engagement with Burma since 1988. With some analysts expecting the region to be at the centre of any US-Chinese disagreements over shared geopolitical interests, such as the South China Sea, one may very well expect to hear more about south-east Asia in the near future.

The referees Howard Webb, Phil Dowd, Martin Atkinson, Michael Jones and Jon Moss pounded the roads of Yorkshire for charity and registered respectable times. Webb was quickest, striding home in 46min 41sec, with Jones narrowly behind in 47.34, followed by Atkinson at 47.45, a time matched by Moss, while Dowd brought up the rear in 50.04. Going the extra mile (or six) in October last year was the Swindon manager Paolo Di Canio, who ended up running the Swindon half-marathon by mistake. The former West Ham forward was the official starter of the race and successfully sounded the starting gun before heading off on the two-mile fun run. The Italian, though, took a wrong turn and ended up running the whole 13.1 miles in his full Swindon kit. &quot;I couldn&apos;t stop, there was a challenge,&quot; he said after finishing in 1hr 49min. &quot;There were three options, I thought I should start with the fun [run] marathon but unfortunately we changed direction, kept going and followed the first group.&quot; &quot;Unfortunately I ended up doing a full half marathon plus 800 metres. At the end I was very happy because I finished without stopping, even for one second. I wasn&apos;t ready but I never stopped running. I&apos;m very happy but it was very tough.&quot; At the full 26.2 mile distance, it tends to be former footballers running for charity rather than irascible Italian managers losing their way on a fun run. Some take it rather more seriously than others and the quickest time we&apos;ve been able to find in the record books is the scintillating 3hr 22min 36sec run of the former Leicester midfielder Muzzy Izzet in the 2011 London marathon. &quot;I think I was 12 minutes off the time needed for an elite start so that is really encouraging. I was pleased with the time although I&apos;d like to get to something like 3.08 or 3.09 if I do it again,&quot; he told the Leicester Mercury. &quot;I&apos;ve probably not done as much training as I thought I needed and I had a couple of weeks when I didn&apos;t do anything, so that wasn&apos;t ideal. But I was quite pleased with things. The last five or six miles were probably the hardest thing I&apos;ve ever had to do.&quot; Hot on Izzet&apos;s heals in the 2011 London race was Dwight Yorke, who came home in 3hr 31min 56sec (and still had the energy for a night on the tiles). The late Gary Speed was the only other footballer we&apos;ve discovered under the four-hour mark, running the 2010 edition in 3hr 49min 22sec. The former West Ham defender Steve Potts registered a 4hr 04min 07sec time in 2008, the former Wimbledon and Tottenham defender Chris Perry finished in 4hr 05min 09sec in 2011, Mark Bright came home in 4hr 55min 17sec in 2007, while Edwin van der Sar ran the 2011 New York Marathon in 4hr 19min 16sec. Know anyone quicker than Izzet, Di Canio or Webb? Let us know at the usual address PLAYERS WRITING NON-FOOTBALL BOOKS (2) Last week, we had a stab at answering Warren Hull&apos;s question about footballers writing books on subjects other than football. The examples were predominantly cookery-based (who doesn&apos;t need instruction on preparing chicken and pasta?), and there are more! &quot;A few years ago my girlfriend signed up for a cookery book club here in Sweden, the idea being that she could order one recipe book a month for a bargain price,&quot; writes Ed Rostron. &quot;After a couple of months she lost interest and they started sending her random books. One that turned up was &apos;Mitt Italien&apos;, by TV football pundit and former Atalanta midfielder Glenn Str\u00f6mberg. &quot;It&apos;s a selection of pasta and pizza recipes organised by region, with brief interviews and tips from other Swedes who&apos;ve played in Italy (Tomas Brolin, Kennet Andersson, Jesper Blomqvist, Sven etc). And it&apos;s actually rather good \u2013 the recipe for rigatoni with ragu bolognese is fantastic \u2013 though I don&apos;t imagine an English translation is available.&quot; Alas, we couldn&apos;t find one, but here&apos;s another for the Christmas list: Sebastian Csar emailed to let us know that the former Hertha Berlin captain Arne Friedrich, now playing for Chicago Fire, co-wrote the optimistically titled &quot;Foodball: Cook like a world champion&quot;. Set in soft focus photos of Friedrich chopping greens while the goateed celebrity chef Ralf Zacherl leans on a football close by, the foreword tells readers to &quot;Keep on rolling the football und keep on cooking!&quot; &quot;There is another bright example of a brilliant footballer writing about something completely different,&quot; writes Eberhard Spohd. &quot;Horst Hrubesch. The German international (21 caps, six goals), the three-times German champion, winner of the Champions Cup and the one to score both goals in the Euro final in 1980 against Belgium [are you chairman of the fan club, Eberhard?] is not only a horse breeder, he is also a great fisherman. &quot;His book Dorschangeln vom Boot und an den K\u00fcsten [Cod fishing from a boat and the coast], which he wrote together with Dieter Schicker, also from 1980, is a classic. The book teaches the reader everything he has to know if he wants to catch cod (and its relatives of the family Gadidae) with a fishing rod.&quot; And having faithfully translated the link Eberhard sent in, we can tell you that Der Spiegel called it &quot;a classic in the fishing literature&quot;, no less. &quot;Might I mention that famed Nobel-prize winning physicist, Niels Bohr, was a keen footballer and played in goal for his local Copenhagen team, Akademisk Boldclub.&quot; Yes, you might, Greg Jenner. &quot;His brother Harald, a noted mathematician, even represented Denmark as a footballing Olympian. Admittedly their books are not quite as readable as Carlos Puyol&apos;s culinary adventures, but they go some way to dispelling the myth that footballers are stupid.&quot; Indeed \u2013 unfortunately the Knowledge&apos;s usually excellent atomic physics is a little rusty, so no excerpts here. The same goes for The Road to Ithaca, a book by the former Barcelona defender Oleguer Presas. Tipping us off, Eoghan Kenny calls it &quot;wide-ranging and rather high-brow for a footballer&quot;; Wikipedia has it down as a series of recollections from his younger days, but the reviews describe a cross between a football story and a political manifesto, which likens Barcelona&apos;s 2005 title-winning side to Catalan fighters in the Spanish Civil War. We think. It certainly beats Arild Stavrum&apos;s efforts for imagination. &quot;I doubt they have been translated in to English,&quot; says Jostein Nygard, &quot;even with the recent flood of Scandinavian crime novels to the British market.&quot; Stavrum left Molde having just turned 32, and a few years later published &quot;31 years on the Pitch&quot;. Here&apos;s some of the blurb: &quot;Joachim learned to dribble at four years old. While growing up, he had three dreams: he wanted to be the top scorer in the Norwegian Premier League, a national team player and a pro. At 31, he has achieved his goals. He has lived well by playing football for many years, but he&apos;s getting to the end of his contract at Molde FK and fears that his career is nearing its end.&quot; Hmm. Thanks also to Alex Locatelli for pointing out the Fulham goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer&apos;s series of children&apos;s books, about young footballer Edward &quot;Megs&quot; Morrison&apos;s struggles to get a soccer team going after moving to Australia. &quot;Will the Vootball Kids band together in the face of adversity? Can Megs remain focused on football despite some spiky issues at home? And how will the Kids perform in their first season playing competitive football?&quot; We&apos;re hooked \u2013 which is more than can be said for our friend Eberhard Spohd, who only started reading about cod fishing after tiring of &quot;Everything: A fictional historical novel&quot;, by the former German goalkeeper Bodo Illgner. &quot;I couldn&apos;t read it long enough to find out what it&apos;s about,&quot; says Eberhard. &quot;Too many greasy soft-porn scenes make this book unreadable.&quot; If ever there was assurance of the merits of staying in one&apos;s comfort zone, however, it surely comes in the form of &quot;Unforgettable Fire, the story of U2&quot;: written by Eamon Dunphy, eviscerated by critics, and emailed to us by Dave Bruen. Dunphy, a former Millwall, Charlton and Republic of Ireland midfielder, had already written his Diary of a Professional Footballer when he was asked by U2&apos;s manager to write about the band&apos;s early years. Though plenty of U2 fans enjoyed it, the book was variously described as &quot;cloying and worshipful&quot; and &quot;full of breathtaking inaccuracies&quot;. After publication, Dunphy criticised the way the band had treated him, the band said he had failed to let them see the manuscript and sort out the mistakes; Dunphy called Bono a &quot;pompous git&quot;, Bono reportedly called Dunphy &quot;rat poison&quot;. Either way, the book took a panning. &quot;The catalogue of errors piles up until it&apos;s impossible to see beyond it,&quot; wrote Neil McCormack, for Hot Press. &quot;If what I know first-hand is so inaccurately represented (and these are not all the errors of which I&apos;m aware, not by a long shot), then I can have no faith in any of the rest of Dunphy&apos;s storytelling. There is simply nothing I can take at face value in this book. &quot;Dunphy&apos;s not only guilty of outrageous inaccuracy, he is also grossly ill-informed on the subject that should be at the story&apos;s core: music... I filled 18 pages of a small notebook with Dunphy&apos;s errors, misrepresentations, misunderstandings and misinformed comment. &quot;Sometimes, reading this book, I get the feeling somebody&apos;s been pulling Dunphy&apos;s leg.&quot; DELIBERATE OWN GOALS &quot;I was wondering if an own goal has ever been intentionally conceded by a player in protest or out of anger at his own club/fans/manager?&quot; writes Thomas Houghton. This is one of those bits where we find a few stories that don&apos;t quite fulfil the criteria so as to avoid leaving a blank space. There was talk that William Gallas had managed to force a move from Chelsea to Arsenal by threatening to score own goals if they made him stay but, though recent performances suggest sabotage is not beyond him, Gallas always denied the accusation. In the 1950s, Brian Clough accused his Middlesbrough team-mates of deliberately conceding goals in order to fleece the bookmakers. That (and the fact that he kept scoring enough goals to even matches up) made him an unpopular man in the dressing room. There have been plenty of protest own goals scored \u2013 149 in one game, in fact, but the target of the players&apos; ire was the referee. In 2002 AS Adema beat the reigning Madagascan champions Stade Olympique de L&apos;Emyrne 149-0 after SOE&apos;s players spent the whole game putting the ball into their own net during the final game of a round-robin title play-off. In the preceding game, SOE had been put out of the running for the title when the referee awarded a dubious late penalty with which DSA Antananarivo equalised. The coach and four players received suspensions and stadium bans, which at least spared them the agita of fans who wanted their money back.

Booksellers are back out on Columbus Avenue, the movie theaters are open, the nail salons are full. The New York City Marathon \u2013 which passes through the Upper East Side and Central Park \u2013 will go ahead on Sunday, because nobody has anything better to do than clean up millions of paper cups trampled underfoot by runners blocking the avenues. But a few miles south, it&apos;s another city. There is no power anywhere in lower Manhattan, cellphone service is spotty, and many buildings have no water or heat. Residents who&apos;d planned for a short blackout, as happened here for one day in 2003, are facing days without power \u2013 and, as a consequence, without food or supplies. Downtowners are streaming north to buy groceries or charge their phones, or else to work remotely when they can&apos;t do so from home. Outside the Ace Hotel, a few blocks north of the electricity cutoff point, people were huddled together at a station to recharge their devices, and in one coffee shop on Amsterdam Avenue no fewer than 20 Wi-Fi refugees were hunched over laptops. The gyms have been overloaded with downtowners taking showers, which has generated a strange economic divide: the tony Equinox chain sent out an email telling clients that no guests were allowed, while the less pricy New York Sports Club has swung open its doors to one and all. Herman Luk, who works at a startup tech company, was coming up Sixth Avenue from his apartment in Tribeca, where he lives on an upper floor of a high-rise.  &quot;Water ran out yesterday morning,&quot; he explained, &quot;and the emergency lights in the building died out. It&apos;s pitch black in the stairwell.&quot; He and his girlfriend made only moderate preparations; they filled their bathtub with water and bought a few supplies, but after last year&apos;s overhyped Hurricane Irene they decided not to stockpile. Now, Luk was coming uptown to buy provisions \u2013 everything near him is closed. &quot;Uptown it&apos;s like it never happened, just like Irene,&quot; he said. &quot;Downtown, with no power and no water, you feel like you&apos;re living in the south in hurricane season \u2013 except you live 14 floors up.&quot; Luk needed more than an hour to get uptown, first on a free bus and then on foot, and no wonder: the roads are choked with Bangkok-style traffic. On an average weekday the New York subway system logs 5.3m rides; push all of those onto the streets and this is what you get. Yellow cabs are permitted to take multiple fares, as they have during previous transit strikes, and thousands of interloping gypsy cabs are in the mix as well. But it takes ages to get anywhere, and even a bike won&apos;t help much; the avenues of midtown are glorified parking lots, and matters aren&apos;t helped by the closure of 57th Street, home to the half-destroyed crane alongside the most expensive residential project in town. You might as well walk. At the Museum of Modern Art, a queue of stir-crazy tourists snaked all the way through the lobby, out the front door, and halfway down 53rd Street. But the New Museum, down on the Bowery, is shut, while in Chelsea, home to the city&apos;s leading commercial art galleries, power remains out and flooding has destroyed untold millions of dollars in paintings and sculpture. The Metropolitan Opera is going back on tonight; Off-Broadway is dark for the foreseeable future. The big department stores along 5th Avenue are open, and doing a fair bit of business; the boutiques of Soho and Nolita are shuttered. The cutoff for electricity, at least on the west side, is 25th Street. At Seventh Avenue the stationery store on the north side of 25th is open for business, while the grocery store on the south side is shuttered, its inventory rotting away. Some of the busiest sites in the city are the delis and bodegas one or two blocks north of the power divide; hundreds and hundreds of downtowners stop at the first open business they see for coffee and the New York&apos;s traditional express breakfast of scrambled eggs on a bagel. The contrast is even starker when the sun goes down. &quot;Last night, it looks like an apocalypse happened,&quot; said Stephanie Lee, an attorney who lives in Stuyvesant Town, the massive residential development on the East River. The buildings there took on three feet of water; there&apos;s now no electricity, no heat, no internet access, and only intermittent water. She was headed back to her seventh-floor apartment to fetch clothes and food before moving in with a friend uptown. She doesn&apos;t feel unsafe, but the neighborhood is being abandoned; at night, without street lamps, &quot;it feels like Gotham in Batman.&quot; Tuesday night in the West Village, on the corner of Bleecker Street and 8th Avenue, a small grocery store that remained open had no power for its freezers or refrigerators, but was doing brisk flashlight-aided business in tuna fish and potato chips. The cashier didn&apos;t even flinch when a woman asked if she could pay with a credit card. A few bars were open, all lit by candles and with the predictable chalkboard outside advertising plenty of booze, but they weren&apos;t doing much business. The one activity that everyone seems to engage in: taking Instagram photos of felled trees. Not far from anyone&apos;s mind is that other disaster, 11 years ago, that cut downtown off from the rest of New York. But while the confusion and camaraderie of lower Manhattan reminds us of the days after 9/11, the mood remains reassuringly pleasant, at least so far.  &quot;There&apos;s a generator in Stuy Town, and one guy last night begged to use my phone charger,&quot; Lee said. &quot;I thought he had an emergency call to make. Turned out he&apos;d met some girl the night before and he wanted to see if she&apos;d texted him.&quot; But whether the mood downtown remains as light this evening, and in the unknown powerless days to come, is far less certain.", "publicationDate": "2012-10-31T20:06:00Z", "tags": ["New York", "Hurricane Sandy", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "US news", "World news", "US weather"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-news-blog/2012/oct/31/new-york-hurricane-sandy", "title": "A tale of two New Yorks: Sandy splits city but its residents band together", "sentences": ["&quot;Downtown, with no power and no water, you feel like you&apos;re living in the south in hurricane season \u2013 except you live 14 floors up.&quot; Luk needed more than an hour to get uptown, first on a free bus and then on foot, and no wonder: the roads are choked with Bangkok-style traffic."]}, {"article": "We could hear the children&apos;s excited voices as they approached through the darkened grounds of the lodge. Then they burst onto the terrace in a riot of bright colours and flashing silver, carrying a birthday cake. The candles were lit and everyone \u2013 men and women from local Lisu and Akha tribes, the voluble children, four thirtysomething Americans and me \u2013 sang Happy Birthday in a cacophony of languages. The shiny-eyed birthday girl, Monica from Chicago, was dragged into a circle of costumed Lisu as they began a complicated traditional dance to music from bamboo wind instruments called fulu jewlews. Gradually the rest of us joined in until there were more than 20 people holding hands in a ring, the westerners grinning with exhilaration as we attempted to copy the steps. This didn&apos;t feel intrusive or exploitative; it felt a bit like the best kind of family wedding, where by the end even grumpy uncles have been coaxed to their feet and everyone is on the dancefloor. Afterwards, Monica cut her cake and handed it round. A profound silence fell, broken only by spoons scraping on plates. These kids have never had cake before, said our guide, Sonny. Wanting to avoid the human safaris offered in some parts of the world, where tribespeople are seemingly bullied into performing for gawping tourists, I had been attracted by two lodges in northern Thailand run by a company called Asian Oasis. Far from &quot;using&quot; tribespeople to attract tourists, it &quot;uses&quot; tourists to bring income to remote hilly areas. At Lanjia Lodge in Chiang Rai province and Lisu Lodge closer to Chiang Mai, local people are directly involved in the lodges \u2014 as partners and planners on a profit-sharing basis, and as employees on above-average wages. My tour operator said this was the best example of community tourism it has ever seen in south-east Asia, and there is a lot of it around.     Batik-making at Lanjia Lodge. Photograph: Liz Boulter    The first lodge I went to, Lanjia, is the most remote. Two hours&apos; drive from Chiang Rai, it sits on the edge of Kiew Karn village with stupendous views of the Mekong valley and Laos beyond. Six four-roomed bungalows are scattered down the hillside, each with a generous terrace perfectly placed for enjoying those views. Village life was going on around it when I arrived: women of the Hmong and Lahu tribes plaiting bamboo for various uses, or embroidering handicrafts, children playing something that looked like rounders, with a ball made of screwed-up paper and old flip-flops for bases. I loved my room, with its walls of plaited bamboo, sliding shutters, and wide bed on a wooden platform with a stunning hand-embroidered bedspread and a mosquito net. It was a bit like sleeping in a very cosy basket, albeit one with electricity and a simple en\u00a0suite bathroom. All meals \u2013 bacon and eggs for breakfast if you want it, and delicious fresh Thai soups and curries for lunch and dinner \u2014 are taken on the terraces. You sit at low tables on triangular &quot;axe&quot; cushions. Eco-friendly, fair-minded tourists will also be pleased to learn that the lodges, built on land leased from local people, are made out of wood and bamboo purchased from villagers. Environmental damage is lessened with solar panels for the plentiful hot water, and drinking water in reusable glass bottles. And there&apos;s no aircon \u2013 not a problem as these hills are cool and airy compared with the stifling plains of Thailand. To maximise local involvement (and income) visits to the lodges come with a package of activities. And they were all designed, it seemed, to make tourists feel inadequate \u2013 in the nicest possible way. I opted for a half-day trek, plus a village tour with a stop at a batik workshop. The trek took us by some very narrow and slippery footpaths to a waterfall in hills to the west, passing wild banana trees so raggedy they looked like they were hung with old clothes. I was wearing sturdy trainers and thought I was managing the steep terrain pretty well, until I saw that Su Chin, our 17-year-old-guide (in tribal dress) was nimbly leaping up the rocky track in flip-flops.     The veranda at Lisu Lodge. Photograph: Liz Boulter    If he made me feel old, the smiley women at the batik workshop in the village made me feel five again. They sat me\u00a0down with a square of white\u00a0cotton and tried to guide my ham-fisted attempts to draw patterns in hot wax using a sort of stylus. &quot;Bless, she&apos;s doing her best,&quot; their looks said, then they tweaked my handiwork to make it worthy of being dipped three times in indigo, then in boiling water to remove the wax. It was easy to see how one intricate two-feet-square piece could take a Hmong woman a whole day. A young girl might spend a year making herself a festive outfit to catch the eye of a boy she fancies at the New Year courtship ceremony. The tour of the village had also included visiting shamans of both Hmong and Lahu tribes, with explanations of ceremonies for births, deaths, sickness and ill fortune. This, it has to be said, did have a whiff of human safari about it. Maybe these men (there are also female shamans, though I didn&apos;t meet one) are comfortable with camera-clicking westerners being shepherded into their homes each day. Maybe they don&apos;t care as long as they get a share of our tourist dollars. (They don&apos;t speak Thai, so interaction, via two interpreters, was minimal.) Or maybe I&apos;m just being oversensitive \u2026 Lisu Lodge is in lower, more undulating country, overlooking lush fields of rice and tobacco, and was Asian Oasis&apos;s first eco-lodge. In 1992 it opened a single village house offering visitors an authentic tribal experience, right down to very basic shared facilities, noise and stink from a pigsty next door, and single-layer bamboo lattice walls that afforded barely any privacy (sometimes a problem when with enthusiastic honeymooning couples were in residence). But tourist-kind cannot bear too much authenticity, so Lisu Lodge now comprises four six-bedroom guesthouses built in traditional style, but with windows and en\u00a0suite bathrooms. A huge veranda is the setting for meals, drinks \u2014 and impromptu birthday parties. In the early morning the air at the lodge smelt of coriander, with a\u00a0hint of woodsmoke from village cooking fires. At 8am the sound of young voices singing the Thai national anthem floated over from the primary school. The day&apos;s programme comprised fairly mainstream tourist stuff, but was no less exciting for that, and it was organised by the lodge, so at least our money would be doing some good. An elephant trek (be prompt delivering a banana treat when they curl their trunk back towards your seat, or risk having pachyderm snot &quot;huffed&quot; over you) was followed by white-water rafting on the Mae Tang river (which we shared at one point with more elephants taking an afternoon dip) and mountain biking to another Akha village, where we could buy handicrafts.     Local girls at Lisu Lodge. Photograph: Liz Boulter    But what I probably enjoyed most could hardly be called an &quot;activity&quot;. Returning to that lovely veranda, I\u00a0lay in loose cotton pyjamas while Seu Pha, a mother of three, treated me to a Thai massage. Using fingers and thumbs of steel, plus her elbows and the soles of her feet, she pushed, pulled and stretched my body into glorious floaty submission. Some of the positions she put my limbs into felt vaguely familiar, then it occurred to me: this was Pilates for the terminally lazy. Seu Pha&apos;s English was minimal but we managed friendly woman-to-woman exchanges about our ages, our children, and those problematic beings known as husbands. I was the only guest at Lisu that particular day so, the massage over, Seu Pha&apos;s young daughters took me in hand for the rest of the afternoon, exclaiming over my jewellery and make-up (&quot;mascara&quot; was, strangely, a word they knew well) and taking pictures with my camera. When they said they&apos;d dance for me I was expecting something tribal, so was surprised when 11-year-old Meeh and her friend launched into a modern pop routine, with moves any British tween would have recognised. Not particularly authentic or traditional then, but with the kids seemingly as pleased to have me there as I was to be entertained by them, this was something even more valuable: a\u00a0small slice of real village life.  Life boat: a river cruise with a conscience     The Mekhala on the Chao Phraya river in Bangkok    Asian Oasis, the company that runs Lisu and Lanjia lodges, also operates overnight cruises on the Chao Phraya river from Bangkok. But unlike some similar offerings, its trips on converted rice barges are designed to help bring wealth to poor rural areas, while preserving traditional ways of life by controlling visitor numbers. At a pier in central Bangkok I boarded the Mekhala, a boat of beautiful polished teak with six en suite cabins and a smiling staff of three. Nibbling rice crackers and sipping cold drinks we set off up into the steady traffic on this main artery of Thailand. Long-tail boats zipped past, and barges pulled by tugs carried everything from empty Pepsi bottles to sand and gravel for Bangkok&apos;s construction industry. The city finally gave way to villages of simple riverside houses on stilts. This area was under water for three months in 2011, and money from the Mekhala (the name means angel in Thai) had been used to help flood victims. We took in a food market in the village of Batum Thani before dinner on board. Dawn next day was cool and peaceful as we headed for another little-visited village, Baan Saladaeng, home to a minority Mon (ethnically Burmese) community. I watched monks paddling along the river collecting alms, and black and white storks launching their huge bodies into the air. People tended floating vegetable gardens and fished for freshwater prawns. At the market the day before we had stared in shock at buckets and washing up bowls of live fish, frogs and small turtles. No, they&apos;re not for eating, Eddie from the boat assured us. Devout Buddhists buy them to gain extra grace by releasing them back into the river. I was tempted to scoff that the creatures wouldn&apos;t have been taken from the water at all if there weren&apos;t ready buyers. But then I&apos;m not living on very little beside a river that could rise up and ruin my life with no notice. Any extra bit of good fortune must be worth grabbing with both hands.  \u2022 The trip was provided by Experience Travel Group (020-3627 6986, experiencesoutheastasia.com).

Joanne Calderwood gave up plans to qualify as a nurse to train full time as a fighter in mixed martial arts (MMA). Now she finds herself on the brink of fame after an emphatic victory in the United States. Calderwood knocked out opponent Ashley &quot;Smashley&quot; Cummins (YouTube footage here) in the first round of their fight in Kansas City in October. It took her unbeaten professional record to four straight wins, making her one of Britain&apos;s most successful international competitors in a sport its critics regard with wariness and distaste. While the inclusion of women&apos;s boxing in the 2012 Olympics has shone a spotlight on the likes of British gold medallist Nicola Adams, mixed martial arts fighters like Calderwood have remained largely out of the public eye. Yet in the United States, where women&apos;s MMA is &quot;really huge&quot;, she says, promoters are looking for her next opponent. Modest and quietly-voiced, with aspirations to become a nurse, Calderwood doesn&apos;t fit the stereotypical image of someone who fights for a living. But with three knockouts to her name, no one in her sport is doubting her credentials:   Everyone in America thought I was really quiet. But when I&apos;m in the cage I really come out of my shell.  Calderwood&apos;s first experience of combat sports came when she began training in Muay Thai kick-boxing aged 13.  My brother was meant to be going to a class with a friend.      Scottish female cage-fighter Joanne Calderwood. Photograph: Owen Duffy    The friend pulled out, so I went along to keep him company. He didn&apos;t keep it up, but I did. My mum was really supportive - she thought it would be good for my confidence. Calderwood excelled in training, eventually embarking on a competitive career and facing opponents from around the world, even travelling to fight in Bangkok. But while she racked up victories in the ring, the pressures of training while holding down a job were considerable.  I was working at Central Ayrshire hospital. It was tough because I was doing twelve hour shifts and working nights. I was planning to go to university and become a nurse, but it would have been hard to fit training around my studies. I decided that I really wanted to fight, and I&apos;m only going to have about ten years where I&apos;m able to do that, so while I&apos;d still like to go to uni, it&apos;s something that I can do later on.  The decision paid off. Calderwood&apos;s Muay Thai record stands at 19 wins and two losses. She has captured British, European and world championships. But when she saw a mixed martial arts training session, she realised that she wanted a new challenge. She was entering a controversial sport. Popularised by the success of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, mixed martial arts has been portrayed by critics as a brutal spectacle, and is opposed by the British Medical Association.  Competitors can attack with punches, kicks, knees and elbows or employ a range of chokes and joint locks to force an opponent to submit. The controversy over children as young as eight apparently encouraged to cage-fight in Preston in September 2011 added to its notoriety. MMA aficiondos insist the Preston incident was not cage-fighting, but a form of wrestling. Fans and fighters argue that MMA has a better safety record than other sports and requires high levels of technical skill and physical fitness. Calderwood has risen quickly in the sport, making her debut at Glasgow&apos;s Kelvin Hall, a venue long associated with top-level boxing matches \u2013 it hosts the UK Cage Warriors competition in December. She took a fight in India on four weeks&apos; notice before coming to the attention of the US promotion Invicta Fighting Championships, which showcases women&apos;s MMA. Calderwood&apos;s trainer, Guy Ramsay, said that her success was down to hard work and dedication.  If you were to sum her up in one word, it would be &apos;focus&apos;. There&apos;s no secret to it, she just trains incredibly hard.  A former international level Thai boxer, Ramsay set up his Glasgow Griphouse gym in 2005. He said that MMA had gained popularity in recent years.  The growth has been exponential. At the moment there&apos;s a show every two or three weeks. There are people putting on shows everywhere from Inverness right down to the Borders. And particularly in Glasgow I think there&apos;s been a transition from boxing to Muay Thai and now MMA is superseding everything.  Ramsay said people came to the sport for a variety of reasons.  There&apos;s about a fifty-fifty split between people who want to fight and people who train for fitness. But a lot of folks start out looking to get fit and find they really want to compete. Some people don&apos;t think of themselves as fighters at first because they don&apos;t fit a certain stereotype, but that stereotype doesn&apos;t really exist. We have doctors, nurses, lawyers, carpenters all training with us. The only thing that matters is your willingness to try.

Media coverage of the 2005 7/7 London bombings was notable for the way journalists used citizen mobile phone footage and social media commentary to help tell a fast moving and very confusing story. Since then, whenever a disaster occurs you can be sure someone will be close by, camera phone and connected social network account at the ready, to provide breaking news footage. Because of this new broadcast phenomenon we now know exactly what it looks like to be swept up in a tsunami, escape a terrorist attack, live through an earthquake and even be part of an emergency plane crash landing on New York&apos;s Hudson river. Indeed, the knowledge that everyday folk are likely to capture dramatic news moments has prompted major media organisations like the BBC to search for social media viewpoints for most of their breaking news stories. CNN has gone one better. It has set up iReport, an entire division on its website devoted to citizen journalism. So as Hurricane Sandy caused havoc across New York, Long Island and the Jersey shore it was natural that people went on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to post and share their images and reflections of the super storm. It was also natural, I suppose, for some in the media to be a bit complacent about the ubiquitous role social media now plays in our connected society. Sure it helps beleaguered, understaffed media operations capture eye-popping images but that&apos;s just scratching the surface of how social media can inform and help in and after a crisis. During the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami, as well as during New Zealand&apos;s Christchurch earthquake in 2010, crowdsourced, crisis mapping sites provided by the likes of Ushahidi and Google Maps proved crucial in helping local people and organisations identify communities that were crying out for relief. The two businesses were in action again last week, providing platforms for people around the tri-state area to map the flooding from Hurricane Sandy and helping news organisations like The Huffington Post cover the crisis. Local people also made use of another mapping site, Mappler, to create an up-to-the minute map of open gas stations. In all these examples, people were using social media sites and tools to connect, share and collaborate on core civic needs even as the region&apos;s own infrastructure was struggling or had failed. And the authorities themselves wasted no time using social media to show how hard they were working on the clean up; the Metropolitan Transit Authority posted hundreds of photos on its Flickr account, demonstrating how its workers were pumping out flooded tunnels and repairing mile upon mile of damaged subway tracks. All told it would probably take a small army of crisis analysts and researchers to sift through and make sense of all the created Sandy-related content and the information shared through social media over the past seven days. But that&apos;s exactly the project New York and New Jersey should be undertaking as those states make plans for future flood and hurricane protection. Too often we look at social media as an ephemeral medium. It&apos;s fast and noisy but also quite disposable in many ways. Yet from a research, data-crunching or mapping point of view, the social media &quot;story&quot; of Hurricane Sandy offers a treasure trove of information that can help us prepare for future storms. For years climate scientists and weather researchers have been projecting what could happen to New York if it was hit by a super storm. After Sandy, the authorities have a rich mix of scientific and emergency services data combined with thousands of first-hand social media accounts and maps of what went wrong and what went right during the storm. Establishing a collaborative, forward-thinking approach to learning from and using social media in a crisis isn&apos;t just important for New York&apos;s tri-state region. It&apos;s likely to be relevant for most major urban areas all over the world. By 2050, nearly 75% of the world&apos;s population are predicted to be living in cities. Most of those cities sit near the coast or on major lakes and rivers. But in an age of increasing extreme weather patterns \u2013 notably super storms \u2013 living so close to water becomes as much a liability as an aesthetic pleasure. Cities all over the world are at risk from extreme weather conditions and other infrastructure crises. That&apos;s one reason why, in recent years, a number of companies like Philips, Siemens and Ideo along with NGOs and groups like the C40 Cities have created dedicated research projects aimed at using big data and collaborative techniques (including crowdsourcing) to plan the future of sustainable cities. In one UN-funded project, researchers in Bangkok used a crowdsourcing mobile app to get local people to conduct real time flood monitoring. But perhaps the most advanced approach to using big data to tackle city infrastructure breakdown is IBM&apos;s smarter cities business offering. In Rio de Janeiro, IBM has worked with local authorities to create a new automated alert system that will notify city officials and emergency personnel when changes occur in the flood and landslide forecast for the city. The system uses algorithms to predict how much rain will fall in a given square kilometer. The company believes the system will drastically reduce the reaction times in emergency situations by using instantaneous mobile communications, including automated email notifications and instant messaging, to reach emergency personnel and local people. IBM, through its social business unit, is already becoming an expert at analysing social media conversations and using social technologies to create more effective business operations. Combine this expertise with the big data crunching that has made smarter cities a success and you begin to see how all that online chatter around disasters like Hurricane Sandy might offer valuable insight for building better, more sustainable cities and turn all that social media reaction into action.

One of those ideas has come along now. Ladies and gentlemen, there&apos;s probably going to be a Casablanca 2. No, really. It might be because this is Casablanca&apos;s 70th anniversary, or it might be because there&apos;s a carbon monoxide leak at Warner Bros and everyone is working at a noticeably reduced mental capacity, but the idea of a sequel to Casablanca is genuinely being entertained. A treatment entitled Return to Casablanca, written by Casablanca&apos;s co-writer Howard Koch in 1980, has been unearthed, and there are plans to use it as the building block for Casablanca 2. Koch&apos;s treatment is set in 1961, and involves Rick and Ilsa&apos;s son \u2013 currently rumoured to be played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt \u2013 heading to the Middle East to find his father, falling in love with a character based on Joan Baez, and hunting Nazi outlaws along the way. That&apos;s all well and good, but surely they can do better. This is 2012, after all. Times have changed, and Koch&apos;s treatment needs to change with it. Nowhere, for example, does it suggest that Rick&apos;s son is one of the world&apos;s greatest practitioners of parkour. That clearly needs to be rectified for the final version. And perhaps the young man could win back the love of his estranged father by roping in a ragtag gang of locals to perform an impromptu flashmob dance to the Magnum PI theme tune outside Rick&apos;s Cafe. And I can&apos;t help but notice that there aren&apos;t any animals, either. Everyone likes animals. Maybe one of the characters could have a dog. A kooky dog. A kooky dog that can speak English. No, wait, a kooky dog that can speak English and is also a robot. He could breakdance, too, because that&apos;d really pop in the 3D conversion. Brilliant. Now we&apos;re cooking. That&apos;s assuming Warner Bros will go with the Koch treatment for Casablanca 2. It might not, given that it&apos;s less of a sequel and more a separate story set within the same universe. Perhaps it&apos;d be more of a moneyspinner to take the Hangover 2 route and basically just remake Casablanca note for note under the pretense that it&apos;s a sequel. That could work. Having just watched Ilsa fly away, Rick could then meet another beautiful and mysterious Norwegian ex-lover with whom he&apos;d also previously had a torrid affair in Paris while she thought her imprisoned husband was dead, and the whole story could play out in a perfect replica of the original. Only, you know, this time it could be set in Bangkok. And why stop there? If Casablanca 2 turns out to be a success, belated and ill-advised sequels to untouchable golden age movies might just be the next big thing. Maybe next they could make a sequel to Citizen Kane, where Charles Foster Kane could magically come back to life and start a new career as a rapper. Or The Eighth Seal, where Max von Sydow challenges Death to a game of Just Dance 4 on the Nintendo Wii. Or maybe a sequel to Sunset Boulevard, where someone at Warner Bros in the present day finds Norma Desmond&apos;s long-forgotten screenplay in a pile and mistakenly believes that it&apos;d be a good idea to turn it into a movie, one that possibly stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Actually, maybe not that last one.

Preparations for the visit have dominated local news for the past week: with security agents on rooftops, sniffer dogs on the ground and a Thai military band learning The Star-Spangled Banner in readiness for the first stop in Obama&apos;s three-country tour of the region that underscores his interest in pivoting US foreign policy towards the Pacific. More than 1,000 American security guards and 500 Thai soldiers and police were on hand to protect the most powerful man on the planet as he toured Bangkok&apos;s most famous temple, Wat Pho, with secretary of state Hillary Clinton before meeting Thailand&apos;s ailing King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 84, and holding talks with Thailand&apos;s prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra. Obama said it was &quot;no accident&quot; that he chose south-east Asia as his first trip abroad since re-election and he played up the friendship between Thailand and America, which has lasted almost 180 years. &quot;The United States is and always will be a Pacific nation,&quot; he told a group of Thai and foreign reporters at a joint press conference with Yingluck. &quot;As the fastest growing region in the world, Asia-Pacific will shape much of our security and prosperity in the century ahead, and it is critical to creating jobs and opportunities for the American people.&quot; Many political analysts, however, see America&apos;s renewed interest in the region as a strategic game in holding off China&apos;s influence. Both superpowers consider Thailand to be the region&apos;s &quot;pivot country&quot;. &quot;If Obama is going to succeed in broadening and cementing the Asian pivot and rebalance, he needs the co-operation of allies and partners \u2026 [and] the most non-performing ally is Thailand,&quot; said Thitinan Ponsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies. &quot;Thailand has [recently] been leaning more towards Beijing, and the Chinese know it.&quot; Obama won giggles from the Thai media after saying &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot; in Thai, as well as acknowledging that Thai cuisine was one of his favourites. But he will have to work a bit harder at his Burmese before Monday&apos;s trip to Rangoon, as he mispronounced Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s name twice while discussing her role in promoting democracy in the former pariah nation. While Obama&apos;s talks with Yingluck were serious, the preparations were comical at times. Security agents inspecting Government House before the press conference mistook the giant water lizards that often wander the grounds for man-eating komodo dragons. And nearly 200 years of friendship between Thailand and America meant nothing to the Thai and American security dogs, which growled at one another like old enemies. At Wat Pho, the Temple of the Reclining Buddha (pictured), Obama was overheard jokingly telling the monk who served as his tour guide: &quot;We&apos;re working on this budget; we&apos;re going to need a lot of prayer for that.&quot; The news that Obama&apos;s drinking water was being imported \u2013 out of concerns over potential poisoning or contamination \u2013 became the topic of parody in the English-language daily newspaper, the Nation. Its political cartoonist Stephff sketched bald and beefy Secret Service agents with frothing mouths and guns in hand, readily assaulting innocent waiters offering glasses of water to the president. A Bangkok party on Sunday was Obama&apos;s last chance to let his hair down before his trip to Rangoon, followed by meetings at the East Asia summit in Cambodia. But fellow guest Thitinan Ponsudhirak said it was highly unlikely the closed gala would be &quot;anywhere near rockstar calibre&quot; even though the menu featured tom yum soup and grilled freshwater lobster prepared by chefs from the five-star Mandarin Oriental. &quot;It will be very official and very formal. The world is not always exciting \u2013 sometimes things are just formal and routine,&quot; Thitinan said.

Touring a Buddhist monastery in Bangkok, President Barack Obama was overheard discussing crucial talks to stave off the looming tax hikes and spending cuts with state secretary Hillary Clinton and their monk guide. &quot;We&apos;re working on this budget, we&apos;re going to need a lot of prayer for that,&quot; he joked, prompting laughter from all concerned. But back in the US, the mood was a little more optimistic. In a series of interviews Sunday, representatives of both parties appeared to acknowledge a willingness to find compromise, even if significant hurdles remain. Congress has until the end of the year to hammer out a compromise or risk triggering the so-called fiscal cliff \u2013 a toxic mix of swingeing cuts and tax increases that could derail the still delicate US economic recovery. Speaking on CNN&apos;s State of the Union on Sunday, Dick Durbin, the second highest ranking Democrat in the Senate, said: &quot;What I hear is a perceptible change in rhetoric from the other side.&quot; He added: &quot;And what it is is an invitation for our side to basically sit down and say: &apos;What can we do for this country?&apos;&quot; Likewise, senior Republican House representative Tom Price, appeared to suggest that progress had been made. He and his colleagues recognised the need to generate more in tax revenue, he told CNN. &quot;The two sides have identified the tax revenue that we&apos;re willing to discuss, and now it&apos;s time to talk about spending reductions,&quot; Price, a leading conservative, said. But the road ahead is unlikely to be easy. The gulf remains between the two parties when it comes to individual tax increases on the wealthy. Price stood by the argument that such a move would lead to job losses. Instead, the Republicans want to generate more revenue through the closing of loopholes. In addition, any uptake in tax needed to be paired with spending cuts. Meanwhile, Obama was repeatedly warned that he will not sign off on a deal that doesn&apos;t include a raise in the tax rate for America&apos;s super rich.

The 52-year-old is keen to see how state TV reports the historic visit by Barack Obama, who is the first sitting US president to come to Burma. But she is also hoping for an announcement that at least some of the 300 or so political prisoners held in Burmese prisons are to be freed. One of those detainees is her husband, a human rights activist called Myint Aye, who has been held since 2008 on his eighth stint in prison since they were married 30 years ago. &quot;When I saw him last, he was sure he would be released if the president came,&quot; Win said. Expectations for Obama&apos;s visit are high across this poor and troubled country. For the reformist president Thein Sein \u2013 who in under two years has led Burma from being a pariah nation to host of the most powerful man in the world \u2013 the visit is the most concrete sign yet that he has successfully brought his country in from the diplomatic cold. For pro-democracy campaigners such as Win Htein \u2013 who was elected to parliament in April for the National League of Democracy led by Nobel prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi \u2013 it will reinforce efforts to take on the still hugely powerful military. For the poor, such as Yi Yi Cho \u2013 who ekes out a living from a snack stall in Rangoon&apos;s Ahlone neighbourhood \u2013 Obama&apos;s arrival means a better economic future. &quot;Things should improve now. I hope so. It&apos;s tough these days and getting tougher. Rents, rice medicine \u2013 everything costs more and more and business is bad. Maybe that&apos;ll change,&quot; she said. The visit is also seen as critical outside Burma: in Washington, policymakers see the country as a key part of the US strategic &quot;pivot&quot;, which will privilege Asia over Europe or the Middle East. Obama&apos;s aides hope the intense diplomatic effort will yield dividends where similar attempts to engage other &quot;rogue states&quot; such as North Korea have failed. A key goal is to roll back Chinese influence. The trip is not without controversy. Many, particularly outside the country, say it has come too soon and rewards only partial reform. &quot;You squander some leverage by making this trip so early in the liberalisation process,&quot; said Michael Kugelman, an expert on South Asia at the Woodrow Wilson Centre in Washington. &quot;This very intense outreach to what is still a very repressive state \u2013 and, in terms of its military, a sadistic one \u2013 is fraught with risks.&quot; Speaking in Bangkok on Sunday, Obama said his visit was an acknowledgement of Burma&apos;s progress towards democracy, and not an endorsement of the government. &quot;I don&apos;t think anybody is under the illusion that Burma&apos;s arrived, that they&apos;re where they need to be,&quot; he said. &quot;On the other hand, if we waited to engage until they had achieved a perfect democracy, my suspicion is we&apos;d be waiting an awful long time. &quot;One of the goals of this trip is to highlight the progress that has been made and give voice to the much greater progress that needs to be made in the future.&quot; Obama is due to address hundreds of activists and parliamentarians at Rangoon University on Monday after meeting Aung San Suu Kyi and Thein Sein. But according to Phil Robertson, of campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW), even if the president&apos;s public comments make his hosts uncomfortable, the real question is, what will change on the ground when he is gone? &quot;The levers that are driving this policy are opaque and our concern is that human rights gets left behind,&quot; Robertson said. The impatience of businesses, in the US and elsewhere, to invest in Burma, which has vast natural resources and a population of about 60 million with few consumer goods, has fuelled suspicions that commercial interests are accelerating the engagement process. On Sunday, HRW released evidence of recent violence between ethnic minorities in the west, which has so far killed hundreds and displaced tens of thousands, largely Rohingya Muslims. In the north and east, ethnic minorities have long suffered human rights abuses at the hands of the military. Khun Htun Oo, a politician from the Shan ethnic minority, said Obama &quot;should have waited to see if Burma is on the right track&quot; before coming. &quot;It is still rather early,&quot; he said. &quot;Burma still has so many problems.&quot; Administration officials have worked hard to defuse such concerns, speaking of their intention to raise difficult issues with the Burmese authorities. Obama spent Sunday in Thailand, a long-term US ally in the region, and will fly on to Cambodia to attend a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) on Tuesday. The timetabling of the trip was in part determined by a busy domestic agenda with the president facing tough battles over economic policy at home and rolling crises elsewhere in the world, particularly the Middle East. &quot;Making this trip now makes sense,&quot; said Kugelman. One difference from many other trips undertaken by Obama in recent years elsewhere in the world is the depth of pro-American sentiment in Burma. The most senior US official to visit Burma previously was vice-president Richard Nixon in 1953. The Burmese military seized power in the former British colony nine years later, violently repressing any dissent and, over following decades, destroyed a once promising economy through mismanagement and graft. After an uprising in 1988, elections were held, but the results \u2013 a victory by Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s NLD \u2013 were ignored. Successive sanctions imposed by the US and the EU over the following 20 years were suspended in April in recognition of the changes since November 2010, when Aung San Suu Kyi was freed from house arrest. The result, said one diplomat in Yangon, was that as the US was seen as being absent through the bad times, there was a general belief that its return means good times. &quot;The US is also seen as having supported the democracy movement against the military. There&apos;s a huge fund of goodwill,&quot; he said. Popular culture also plays a role. In Rangoon, the pirated DVDs sold are of Hollywood films, not Chinese productions. English is still the most popular second language. Thi Ha Saw, a respected editor and vice-president of the new Association of Independent Journalists, said people were excited. &quot;Obama&apos;s coming indicates a much closer relationship in the future and that will be a boost for the reform process. It makes [the changes] seem real,&quot; he said. Thi Ha Saw believes most people see closer ties with the US as a way out of Chinese influence and towards better human rights \u2013 though he said the recent changes could still be reversed. The extent and speed of the reforms in Burma are still hotly debated by observers. Their impact is certainly yet to be felt by many in rural areas and the urban poor. Despite glimmerings of emerging democratic institutions, the old security apparatus is still potent. Before Obama&apos;s visit, activists say, security officials rang hundreds of pro-democracy campaigners asking them where they would be on the day the president was in Burma and what they planned to do. One recently released prisoner said she hoped Obama would not &quot;get the wrong impression&quot; during his short stay. But in Rangoon at least, the sense of change is inescapable.

The first great reckoning appeared in a 1983 issue of the American Journal of Surgery. Surgical Management of an Epidemic of Penile Amputations in Siam, by Kasian Bhanganada and four fellow physicians at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, introduces the subject: &quot;It became fashionable in the decade after 1970 for the humiliated Thai wife to wait until her [philandering] husband fell asleep so that she could quickly sever his penis with a kitchen knife. A traditional Thai home is elevated on pilings and the windows are open to allow for ventilation. The area under the house is the home of the family pigs, chickens, and ducks. Thus, it is quite usual that an amputated penis is tossed out of an open window, where it may be captured by a duck.&quot; The report explains, for readers in other countries: &quot;The Thai saying, &apos;I better get home or the ducks will have something to eat,&apos; is therefore a common joke and immediately understood at all levels of society&quot;. The bulk of the paper reports how the doctors and their colleagues learned, over the course of attempting 18 reimplantations, how to improve the necessary surgical techniques. Unambiguous photographs supplement the text. &quot;Interestingly&quot;, the physicians remark at the very end, &quot;none of our patients filed a criminal complaint against their attackers.&quot; An article called Factors Associated with Penile Amputation in Thailand, published in 1998 in the journal NursingConnections, explores the reasons behind that. Gregory Bechtel and Cecilia Tiller, from the Medical College of Georgia (in Atlanta), gathered data from three couples who had been part of the epidemic. The couples, by then divorced, discussed their experience calmly. Bechtel and Tiller report that in each case, three things had happened during the week prior to dismemberment: (1) a financial crisis; (2) &quot;ingestion of drugs or alcohol by the husband immediately prior to the event; and (3) public humiliation of the wife owing to the presence of a second &apos;wife&apos; or concubine&quot;. In 2008, the Journal of Urology carried a retrospective by Drs Genoa Ferguson and Steven Brandes of the Washington University in St Louis, called The Epidemic of Penile Amputation in Thailand in the 1970s. Ferguson and Brandes conclude that: &quot;Women publicly encouraging and inciting other scorned women to commit this act worsened the epidemic. The vast majority of worldwide reports of penile replantation, to this day, are a result of what became a trendy form of retribution in a country in which fidelity is a strongly appreciated value.&quot; \u2022 Marc Abrahams is editor of the bimonthly Annals of Improbable Research and organiser of the Ig Nobel prize", "publicationDate": "2012-11-19T16:30:00Z", "tags": ["Research", "Medical research", "Higher education", "Education", "Thailand", "World news", "Science"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/nov/19/improbable-research-thai-women-cut-off-penis", "title": "Why Thai women cut off their husbands' penises", "sentences": ["Surgical Management of an Epidemic of Penile Amputations in Siam, by Kasian Bhanganada and four fellow physicians at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, introduces the subject: &quot;It became fashionable in the decade after 1970 for the humiliated Thai wife to wait until her [philandering] husband fell asleep so that she could quickly sever his penis with a kitchen knife."]}, {"article": "Uncertainty is not good for a film&apos;s career, and there are plenty of unknowns surrounding Saudade (a particularly Portuguese form of longing). Directed by Katsuya Tomita, whose day job is driving trucks, it has recently released in France, where no one has ever heard of his two previous efforts. Saudade focuses on the problems of identity and social discontent of several groups of rootless youths. Its characters are unpredictable, alternately languid and enraged, erratic and evasive. The oppressive atmosphere is equally difficult to grasp. The setting in Kofu, population 200,000, the capital of Japan&apos;s Yamanashi prefecture, lacks distinctive features, apart perhaps from its vineyards. On the other hand there are very good reasons to see this uncompromising chronicle of social decay, largely at odds with current Japanese cinema. The way Tomita ties together his fragmented tale is highly original. He gives us the impression he is not paying any particular attention to what he is filming, just picking up the beat of the street and observing his characters with long fixed-frame shots. You may at first be fooled into thinking this is just a trivial, slightly incongruous account of a clash between the construction industry and several hip-hop groups. But gradually something more subtle unfolds. Times are hard in the building industry and a bunch of youths are hankering after a better life. Seiji, initiated by his mate Hosaka to the charms of Thai &quot;hostesses&quot;, becomes a regular in the bars where these migrant workers ply their trade. Predictably Seiji abandons his girlfriend, a beautician, and falls in love with a hostess. A third man, encountered on a building site, sometimes joins this group. He makes the connection to the hip-hop scene, where things are grim too. Takeru belongs to a hip-hop collective, Army Village, its opposition to the local council tainted by rampant nationalism. That sentiment drives them to defy the members of another group, who belong to Kofu&apos;s substantial Brazilian community. Large numbers of people who left Japan several generations ago to settle in Brazil came back in the 1990s to earn a better living until the crisis caught up with Japan and they were relegated to the status of an unwanted sub-class. What ties all this together in the film is the impossibility of integrating the various immigrant groups in a national community founded on exclusion. To make matters worse, the degraded state of society, where money rules, leaves no option for its poorest members, denied any form of solidarity, but to fight it out with one another. Saudade is well worth seeing just for this harsh conclusion, reminiscent of the Japanese new wave, but what makes it even more special is the extreme gentleness with which Tomita highlights the cruelty of social interaction and the urban poetry he deploys to depict the cosmopolitan beauty of these contemporary outcasts. His is a very melancholic take on globalisation. Katsuya Tomita: an unusual route into movie making It is easy enough to picture the slim, youthful-looking Katsuya Tomita as a film director. Seeing him as a truck driver, his bread-and-butter activity, is more difficult. Although he has now directed three feature films, he spends most of his time on the road between Tokyo and his native Yamanashi prefecture. It took two and a half years to make Saudade. &quot;We worked at weekends and during the [week-long] summer and winter holidays,&quot; he says. Much as Seiji and Hosaka in the film, the actors who portray them work on building sites in Kofu. Tomita says the region has been hard hit by the economic downturn. &quot;For the past 20 years people have been subjected to austerity measures, but commercial films don&apos;t deal with such topics.&quot; &quot;I didn&apos;t know how to enter the film industry, but I knew that the constraints of commercial cinema would prevent me from making the films I want,&quot; Tomita adds. For over 10 years he has been producing, directing and distributing guerrilla films with friends at the Kuzoku collective. Saudade is the biggest project so far. The aim was to describe the Kofu hip-hop scene and the increasingly difficult predicament of working people. &quot;But I added about 40 sequences while we were shooting,&quot; he explains. At the outset he had barely noticed that his birthplace was also home to a large Brazilian community, itself drawn from early 20th-century Japanese migrants to Brazil. Many of them are not really Brazilian and certainly not accepted as Japanese \u2013 some do not even speak the language. The length of the film (almost three hours) reflects this addition. This is the first Kozuku-produced film to reach a wider audience, both in Japan and at international festivals. Tomita now wants to make a film on Thai sex workers, but if the project works out, shooting in Bangkok will force him to leave his truck in the garage, for a while.

We have also been treated to some notable curiosities, such as The Notting Hill Mystery by Charles Warren Adams, an innovative collection of diary entries, letters, witness interviews and chemical analysis reports, which was first published in 1862-3 in serial form, and,\u00a0most recently, Andrew Forrester&apos;s 1864 collection of short stories featuring the first professional female detective in British fiction (The Female\u00a0Detective, British Library Publishing, \u00a38.99).     xx    Now comes The Return of the Thin Man by Dashiell Hammett (Head of Zeus, \u00a312.99), which contains two stories for the screen and an outline for a screenplay. The stories, written in 1935 and 1938, became the second and third in the series of six Thin Man films starring William Powell and Myra Loy as Nick and Nora Charles. While not as satisfying as Hammett&apos;s novels, The Return of the Thin Man is a must for enthusiasts, with plenty of his trademark snappy dialogue as well as a fascinating commentary by Hammett&apos;s granddaughter Julie M Rivett and biographer Richard Layman.     xx    Hard Twisted by C Joseph Greaves (Bloomsbury Circus, \u00a312.99) is a superb first novel, based on a true story from the depression-era US of rapist and former convict Clint Palmer, who effectively kidnapped 13-year-old Lucile Garret after \u2013 unbeknown to her \u2013 killing her father, and took off on a spree through Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado and Utah, which ended in a double murder. Written in a style that is the prose equivalent of a Dorothea Lange photograph, it is, as much as anything, a coming-of-age story. Garret has an instinct for survival, but the slow erosion of her hope for a better future in which she will be united with her missing father makes for extraordinarily moving reading.     xx    Another generation-spanning relationship \u2013 British this time, and set in an unnamed English seaside town \u2013 is detailed in Frances Fyfield&apos;s latest psychological thriller, Gold Digger (Sphere, \u00a312.99). Fyfield specialises in sympathetic portraits of social misfits and the misunderstood, and Gold Digger is the tale of the unlikely alliance and eventual marriage of 17-year-old burglar Di, from the local &quot;bad family&quot;, and wealthy pensioner Thomas Porteous. When Porteous dies, his daughters, poisoned against their father by the mother who left him before he got rich, try to get their hands on the loot, including the art collection that was the passion of his life. This is a subtle but razor-sharp dissection of a family at war, with parents who have no compunction about lying, cheating and using their children as emotional hostages in order to enrich themselves.     xx    Scratch Deeper by Chris Simms (Cr\u00e8me de la Crime, \u00a319.99) is the first in a new series featuring DC Iona Khan of Manchester&apos;s counter-terrorism unit. Days before the Labour party conference, the police get a tip-off from a group of cavers who have been exploring the network of long-disused tunnels beneath the city and are concerned that their latest recruit may not be all that he seems. As the case is regarded as being of low importance, tyro Khan is sent to investigate, and soon realises that there is more to it than meets the eye. Plenty of tension, a likeable heroine and some superb set-pieces in the claustrophobic subterranean tunnels add up to an exhilarating read.     xx    John Burdett&apos;s Bangkok-based series featuring Royal Thai police detective Sonchai Jitpleecheep is one of the genre&apos;s great pleasures, and his latest, Vulture Peak (Corsair, \u00a36.99), is well up to his usual high standard. Here, Jitpleecheep investigates beautiful but creepy Chinese twins Lilly and Polly Yip, who have taken capitalism to the extreme by trading in human organs, whether or not the donors are willing to part with them. It&apos;s a fascinating examination of the morality of treating\u00a0the body as a commodity, whether it&apos;s\u00a0for rent \u2013 as in the case of Jitpleecheep&apos;s mother and wife, both former prostitutes \u2013 or sale with no\u00a0return.     xx    Finally, still on the theme of body parts \u2013 in this case pickled sharks and decomposing calves&apos; heads \u2013 Killing the Emperors by Ruth Dudley Edwards (Allison &amp; Busby, \u00a319.99) is the latest in a comic crime series, which has, over the years, delivered hefty slaps to the rumps of various sacred cows. Here, she takes a swipe at the world of conceptual art, with her heroine, the magnificently monstrous reactionary libertarian Baroness &quot;Jack&quot; Troutbeck, on splendidly splenetic form when she is kidnapped and forced to take part in a lethal version of Big Brother, orchestrated by a ripped-off and very angry Russian oligarch. \u2022 Laura Wilson&apos;s A Capital Crime is published by Quercus.", "publicationDate": "2012-11-23T08:00:02Z", "tags": ["Crime fiction", "Fiction", "Books", "Culture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/23/laura-wilson-crime-roundup-reviews", "title": "Laura Wilson's crime fiction roundup \u2013 reviews", "sentences": ["xx    John Burdett&apos;s Bangkok-based series featuring Royal Thai police detective Sonchai Jitpleecheep is one of the genre&apos;s great pleasures, and his latest, Vulture Peak (Corsair, \u00a36.99), is well up to his usual high standard."]}, {"article": "     Police in Bangkok have fired teargas at thousands of anti-government protestors calling for the overthrow of the Thai government. At least 9,000 people attended the rally, organised by activists who believe the current prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, is the puppet of her brother, the deposed former PM Thaksin Shinawatra. Around 17,000 riot police were deployed to contain the protest, with officers firing tear gas at demonstrators who tried to climb over concrete and barbed wire barriers blocking entry to the rally site, Bangkok&apos;s Royal Plaza, near the parliament. The rally was organised by the royalist Pitak Siam group, led by retired military general Boonlert Kaewprasit, which accuses Yingluck&apos;s government of corruption. The group is supported by the &apos;yellow shirts&apos; of the People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy, who have been involved in destabilising or ousting governments led or backed by Thaksin in 2006 and 2008. Boonlert told supporters: &quot;The world will see this corrupted and cruel government. The world can see the government under a puppet.&quot; A police spokesman said five officers had been injured in the skirmishes, two of them seriously, and that 130 demonstrators had been detained, some of them carrying knives and bullets. At clashes near the UN Asia-Pacific headquarters, near the site of the main rally, least seven police were wounded and up to 132 protesters arrested. Yingluck&apos;s government has invoked the Internal Security Act, which gives police powers to detain protesters, to carry out security checks, and to set up roadblocks. The demonstration reflects the tensions that have destabilised the country since the army ousted Thaksin Shinawatra in military coup in 2006. Thaksin fled the country in 2008, shortly before being found guilty of abuse of power. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political analyst at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said the government&apos;s action against the protesters was heavy-handed and could prove counter-productive. He said: &quot;At this stage, the government is more a threat to itself.

While many of the 10,000 protestors gathered peacefully around a stage set up near the Royal plaza in Bangkok, others repeatedly tried and failed to charge past concrete police barricades and, at one point, attempted to drive a truck straight into the barricades as well. Protesters and riot police were seen throwing tear gas back and forth at one another in sometimes fierce standoff. Five officers were hurt, two of them seriously, and 130 protestors were detained by the rally&apos;s end at dusk. Around 45 protestors were treated in hospital, mainly for tear gas inhalation. Saturday&apos;s rally was organised by a pro-monarchy group called &quot;Patik Siam&quot; (Protect Thailand), led by retired army general Boonlert Kaewprasit, which denounces Yingluck&apos;s government as a corrupt puppet administration of her brother, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. From the central stage that faced the parliament building, Boonlert incited chants of &quot;Yingluck, get out!&quot; and told protestors: &quot;I promise that Pitak Siam will succeed in driving this government out.&quot; Thaksin&apos;s own administration was deposed in a 2006 army coup after rallies by the pro-monarchy &quot;yellow shirt&quot; movement ousted his administration. Four years later, mass protests led by pro-Thaksin supporters led to two months of violent political turmoil that saw around 2,000 wounded and 90 people killed in brutal clashes with security forces. While Yingluck won by a landslide in 2011 elections, simmering political tensions still run high. Pitak Siam is a new group in Thailand&apos;s protest scene, and is linked to the yellow-shirt movement \u2013 although it does not yet seem to be as popular as its leaders would like. Various rumours circulated ahead of Saturday&apos;s rally, among them a threat that Yingluck would be taken hostage and that as many as a million protestors would take to the streets to call for her resignation. Citing safety concerns, the government deployed some 17,000 police and invoked an internal security act that allowed for road closures, curfews and the ban of electronic devices in certain areas. Analysts said the protest did not seem an immediate threat to Yingluck&apos;s administration, but that it proved a thorn in the stability of Thai politics. &quot;Any time you have tens of thousands of people converging, assembling in a central Bangkok location, it becomes a government stability concern,&quot; said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist at Bangkok&apos;s Chulalongkorn University.

These exotic hideaways had infinity pools, their own gyms and waiting speedboats. They could be rented out for cash when not in use by their owners, and cost anything up to \u00a35m to buy. Britons commonly bought them through anonymous British Virgin Islands (BVI) offshore companies. A Bangkok law firm, Limcharoen Hughes and Glanville, employed a couple of expatriate British solicitors and were active with UK clients. When approached by the Guardian, the lawyers denied involvement. Their deputy chief executive officer, Desmond Hughes, said: &quot;Let me categorically correct your assertion that our law firm &apos;sets up&apos; BVI companies. We do not &apos;set up&apos; BVI companies.&quot; He called this a &quot;fundamental error&quot;. But his denial turned out to be more a matter of semantics. Records show the law firm in fact commissioned a specialist incorporation agency in the BVI on their British clients&apos; behalf, to do the detailed work of setting up a series of such offshore companies. One of the Britons who buys and develops villas, the former tennis player David Lloyd, pictured right, was willing to explain. Lloyd, who set up a profitable chain of UK gyms when he retired from sport, says the reason for his two BVI entities, Rise Bright Development and High Joy Group, was not tax avoidance. It was to circumvent Thai laws on land ownership. &quot;It&apos;s purely because in Thailand, you can&apos;t own the land if you&apos;re a foreigner. What you have to do is form a company to buy the land in which a Thai partner owns 51%. That company then gives a lease of the property to a BVI company which you do own. There are no tax advantages: it is purely because of the restrictions on land ownership&quot;. One buyer, Chris Sharp, a retired London shop-owner, told us he had been advised that his BVI company would also allow him to avoid Thai capital gains tax, if he sold the Phuket villa on. Another Thai villa owner is Ian Brimecome, the chairman of the Equitable Life insurance company. He and his wife, Charlotte, used an entity called Fortune Green Holdings in the BVI to buy a holiday home after visiting Phuket in 2007. He told us that another reason why local estate agents and lawyers used offshore companies was to avoid Thai legal problems on inheritance. &quot;Instead of having to change ownership of the property, you can simply transfer the shares in the existing company to the person who inherits.&quot; The British tax authorities depend on offshore villa owners volunteering the existence of their overseas assets and income. Brimecome said HMRC had mounted a detailed investigation in 2010 of such Thai villa purchases, and had given him a clean bill of health. The Guardian/ICIJ Offshore Register: Thailand Ian &amp; Charlotte Brimecome Company: Fortune Green Holdings Chairman of Equitable Life who used offshore entity to buy Phuket villa. Brimecome, who has a \u00a32m home in Pirbright, Surrey, joined the boards of Equitable Life and Axa in 2007. The same year the Brimecomes visited Phuket, the Thai beach resort, to buy a villa. The BVI company to own it was set up through a local law firm. Intermediary: Limcharoen Hughes &amp; Glanville, Bangkok. Brimecome: &quot;The local estate agents and lawyers arrange the sales this way. They say it is less cumbersome than using an on-shore company, and avoids the problems in Thailand of changing the property ownership to your heirs if you die. The shares in the company can simply be transferred instead.&quot; David Lloyd Company: Rise Bright Development; High Joy Group; David Lloyd Asia Co.

More than 800 people died and more than 3 million were affected in what was, for insurers, the most costly fresh water flood in history. More recently, an extreme storm in Beijing took 79 lives. And then hurricane Sandy showed us that even the most advanced cities cannot always protect themselves from the elements. According to reinsurance company Swiss Re, flooding affects 500 million people a year and the financial losses have risen from less than $2bn (\u00a31.3bn) to $15bn (\u00a39.4bn) per year in less than four decades. I&apos;ve previously written that sustainable cities&apos; principal goal is their long term economic competitiveness. Livability, good environmental stewardship and efficiency can help attract talent and investment. That talent and investment may not be deterred by vulnerable cities but it can be repelled by cities that fail to make themselves resilient. China may be especially exposed. A recent OECD report showed that six of the cities with the highest potential asset risk are Chinese, including Guangzhou, Shanghai, Tianjin and Hong Kong. Their combined population is 68.5 million, more than the total population of the UK. However, in Shanghai, where I moved earlier this year, investment in infrastructure and sustainable initiatives is impressive. Shanghai is making great progress in providing a more livable and attractive urban environment but its growth is putting its resources under strain and testing its infrastructure&apos;s ability to handle extreme weather. The scale of China&apos;s potential investment in urban resilience means that the rest of the world will be able to learn from their experience. That said, mature economies have led the way until now. London built its very effective flood barrier in the 1970s. Despite recent events, New York has a resilience strategy based on its nine-step adaptation assessment process to minimise the impact of climate change. Rotterdam has set itself the ambition to achieve 100% resilience by 2025. We also see good practice in Singapore, Copenhagen and elsewhere. But we do also see that legacy cities, in particular, often struggle to achieve best practice. And one challenge they face is how to combine resilience with social, environmental and economic sustainability \u2013 or as the Chinese would put it, harmonious urbanisation. I would argue that there are four key approaches cities should consider as a part of their efforts to combine resilience, sustainability and livability: \u2022 City governments should assume leadership to fully realise the value of resource efficiency, advanced technologies and solutions. That will result in an integrated master plan, which involves co-operation from various departments and agencies within government. The Rotterdam climate proof strategy, for example, comes under the direct responsibility of the mayor, Ahmed Aboutaleb. \u2022 Technological advancement. Take Boston, which responded to the recurrent problem of snow-buried fire hydrants delaying fire fighters in emergencies. The city developed an adopt a hydrant phone app that allows people to take photos of their community fire hydrants, name them and maintain them voluntarily.The app has gone viral. \u2022 Cities should align partnerships with various stakeholders to explore effective collaboration models. We have worked with the Amsterdam Innovation Motor and the city&apos;s utility provider, Alliander, to build a co-operation model to accommodate potential carbon reduction solutions proposed by both the private and public sectors. That partnership resulted in more than a dozen pilot projects deployed in two years. In Japan, Accenture and six other companies partnered with the Yokohama city government to build a collaborative intelligent city, which last year won the first Barcelona Smart City Award. There are now 31 corporate partners involved. \u2022 Cities should take a value-driven approach to infrastructure development and technology deployment. Technology is not an end in itself. The citizen&apos;s user experience must be at the heart of thinking. That&apos;s why it&apos;s important to invite creative app developers in to exploit public sector assets and data to create user friendly apps and services. I tend to look at many things through a Chinese lens these days. Here we expect 300 million people to move to cities in the next 15 years alone. In some ways, these cities have a relatively blank slate to get resilience right. The sheer challenge of coping with explosive growth gives the Chinese a unique approach to urban sustainability. But the more complex efforts of long standing mature market cities can teach Chinese cities lessons in improvisation, navigating constraints and accommodating the sensitivities of multiple interest groups. Both Beijing and New York have suffered similar natural disasters in the last few months. We are likely to make most progress by learning from each other.

In 2005 it reopened, run by two former surveyors who cared about beer and the environment in which to enjoy it. Today this is a friendly, comfortable, 21st-century take on the traditional English pub, selling mainly Norfolk beers and a selection of Belgian ales. With the exception of the odd free-range pork pie, there is no food, or music or entertainment. A bar billiards table sees a considerable amount of use.

There are no drinks menus, you just tell the suit-clad barmen what you like and they&apos;ll invent it for you.

Carrer dels Tallers 1kaysmythe Los Diamantes, Granada  Los Diamantes is a tiny, blink-and-you&apos;ll-miss-it watering hole and tapas bar on a bustling street full of touristy restaurants. The scrumptious smell of fried seafood, ubiquituous in Granada, is almost intoxicating on Calle Navas. The crowded, noisy, bar looked quite daunting at first but we boldly strode in and found a small space by the corner of the bar reasonably easily. As is the practice in Granada, we got a complimentary plate of tapas with our cervezas to start. It was a generous portion of pulpo (octopus) which my boyfriend, who does not like octopus, wolfed down faster than you could say &quot;I thought you didn&apos;t like octopus&quot;. Clams were small and sweet, prawns fresh and garlicky, cuttlefish juicy with crunch tentacles. We resolved to go there again the next night.

The Temple specialises in US ales (and I don&apos;t mean Budweiser or Coors) but also has a good selection of UK, Dutch and Belgian beers. On my visit they had all three Westvleteren Trappist beers in stock (some of the rarest and reportedly best beers in the world) and I was able to try all for the first time. Many of the American beers are also particularly rare (Three Floyds, Stone, etc) and Brewdog beers from the UK appear to be popular here.

The beers are also great and will be brought to your table by efficient bar staff who will mark your beer mat every time you have a new drink so you can tot them up when you pay.

To enter, you step through a doorway of stone piano keys. No English spoken, no beer from a glass, no smoking ban. The place is thick with jazz smoke and there are instruments littered against every wall. Sometimes the regulars pick up a sax or a guitar and jam, cigarettes hanging from their mouths, and the standard of the music is incredible.

Not only does it not really have a &quot;front&quot;, it doesn&apos;t even have road access. But if flash cars were your thing, you probably wouldn&apos;t want to stay here anyway, for the Bangkok Tree House seems to have decided to see how far it can push eco-friendliness and still offer a stylish welcome. A bit of green awareness doesn&apos;t go amiss in traffic-choked Bangkok. I fight my way to the Tree House through the city&apos;s seemingly permanent rot dtit (traffic jam). Leaving my taxi at Sanphawut Pier, a few miles from the centre (to be really green you could walk the mile or so from Bangna Skytrain station), I board a ferry full of schoolchildren, young commuters and old folk with shopping bags and cross the wide grey Chao Phraya river into a different world. Or perhaps a different century. Phra Pradaeng is a pear-shaped patch of land cut off by a meander in the Chao Phraya where, I&apos;m told, life goes on much as it did 200 years ago. Factory chimneys and high-rises are visible across the river but here all is semi-natural swampland, fruit plantations and fishermen&apos;s houses on stilts. Tong, a smiling young Thai from the hotel, meets me at the ferry. Walking past orchards of papaya and coconut, within five minutes we come to a set of small bamboo, steel and glass units. These are the rooms, linked by a raised wooden walkway to the restaurant and pool. One &quot;room&quot; has no walls or ceiling and guests sleep under the stars.     Wood and steel cubes make up the Bangkok Tree House    I am disorientated when first shown to my three-storey &quot;nest&quot;. The floor of the (doorless) loo is clear glass \u2013 giving a view of primordial mud and lush vegetation six feet below. I get my jet-lagged head around that and see that the shower is, oh, out there on the wooden balcony we&apos;ve just walked past (it&apos;s only later I spot the thick bamboo blind). Eventually I make it up a steep (space-saving) alternate-tread staircase to the bedroom, and then up steep outdoor steps to the sundeck. After a snooze on the huge and inviting bed, I can see that, provided you are nimble on your pins and not scared of heights, this is a perfect blend of stylish and environment-friendly. The bed&apos;s on a blond wood platform (the only part of the nest with aircon). The sundeck has a lounger for two and views of treetops and shipping. Fittings are of pleasing chunky wood, towels feel robust rather than fluffy. The hotel is the brainchild of 36-year-old Jirayu (Joey) Tulyanond, whose mother owns the delightful 10-room Old Bangkok Inn, in town. Though a Bangkok native, Joey hadn&apos;t heard of Phra Pradaeng until Time Magazine named it Asia&apos;s best urban oasis in 2006. Seeing the potential of this antidote to the car-clogged city, he put notes through doors across the peninsula asking if any land was likely to be for sale. Phra Pradaeng is green belt land, with no factories or major development, but Joey&apos;s 12-room boutique hotel, when he found a patch of land handy for the Skytrain, was small enough to count as a homestay.     Coconut for breakfast. Photograph: Liz Boulter    I sleep soundly in my bamboo eyrie, and at breakfast Joey starts my education in green but gorgeous hospitality. Sumalee, who works in the kitchen, takes a machete and leads us to a row of palms just outside. Choosing a ripe coconut, she detaches it from the tree and hacks away the green husk and the top of the shell to reveal an interior brimming with sweet juice. When I&apos;ve gorged on this, plus tea, toast, eggs and seven types of tropical fruit, Joey and I climb on bikes and set off into Phra Pradaeng. From 2013, any guest who arrives by bike gets a 15% discount, and use of a bike maintenance workshop. As we ride, he lists his hotel&apos;s green credentials: floors, walls and ceilings of reclaimed wood and local bamboo, insulated with old juice cartons; LED lighting powered by solar and wind energy; solar cookers in the organic meat-free kitchen; rainwater harvesting; and local sourcing of products not grown on site. I only take in so much of this, because the cycling, while fun, takes concentration. We&apos;re riding on elevated concrete walkways, passing simple wooden houses and banana, papaya and mango orchards. The pace of life is slow: the village headman nods as he passes on his moped, and when we reach a road, there&apos;s just one tuktuk in sight. A 250-year-old temple in Bang Namphueng Nok, where we stop for coffee, is mouldering away quietly, precious wall paintings unregarded in the gloom.     An open-air 'bedroom' at the hotel    Tourists do find their way to Phra Pradaeng \u2013 there is a popular floating market here at weekends, but with nowhere to stay, visitors always piled back into town afterwards. That is changing with, as well as the Tree House, a few cheap, atmospheric guesthouses, such as Phuengnang Homestay (+66 2461 38101, phuengnanghome.com, doubles from about \u00a320). But Joey&apos;s place is really cleaning up \u2013 literally. Sharing a river with 10 million people means plenty of rubbish finds its way downstream. The Tree House has pledged to remove a kilo of trash from the Chao Phraya for every booking it takes: as of last Novemberit had cleared 1,021kg. One eccentric feature is naming the rooms after insects. As justification, Joey likes to quote Jonas Salk, developer of the polio vaccine: &quot;If all the insects were to disappear from the earth, within 50 years all life on earth would end. If all human beings disappeared from the earth, within 50 years all forms of life would flourish.&quot; My room, with butterflies everywhere, is great, but there is one with giant ants \u2026 So my list of people the Tree House would not suit includes \u2013 along with petrolheads, families with toddlers, and anyone with vertigo \u2013 those with an aversion to creepy-crawlies.

The body of Patrick Molloy, from Cambridge, was recovered by a fisherman who said the man had been clutching the rope of an inflatable raft several metres from shore but had seemingly lost his grip and drowned. Molloy and Britons James Wilks, 29, and Jerry Robson, 30, had rushed into the water on Sunday morning after being chased out of a nightclub and through a beachside restaurant by five to six Thai men, some of whom had sticks and knives, witnesses told police. Wilks and Robson had swum in different directions from Molloy and were rescued separately in Pattaya Bay. Wills managed to swim to a yacht 500m from shore, while Robson was found by a search and rescue team in the water some 300m from shore, according to the Bangkok Post. According to comments on the local English-language website PattayaOne, seemingly made by friends of the deceased, Molloy was unable to swim. It is believed Molloy was on holiday in Thailand after having been released from an 18-week prison sentence for assault. Neither local police nor the British embassy were able to comment on the particulars of his case. A spokesman for the British embassy in Bangkok said: &quot;We are aware of the death of a British national on the second of December in Pattaya, Thailand. We are providing consular assistance to the family.&quot; Police were collecting statements from Wills and Robson and are still looking for the Thai gang.

Long seen as the arbiter of Thailand&apos;s often brutal political divisions and known as the &quot;father&quot; of the nation, King Bhumibol Adulyadej used his speech to stress stability and harmony. But with the visibly frail monarch having spent the past three years living in hospital and his words today halting and shaky, many Thais are wondering if that stability can survive his succession. In his 66 years on the throne \u2013 the most of any monarch in the world \u2013 King Bhumibol has seen his nation seesaw from democratically-elected government to military-backed coup and back again. One thing that has never waned, however, is his popularity. In a front-page editorial praising the king&apos;s stabilising effect in this nation of 69 million, the largely pro-establishment English-language newspaper the Nation said &quot;the king as the individual and the monarchy as the institution have merged to represent the ultimate symbol of unity of Thailand&quot;. Now facing both the king&apos;s ill health and the so-called &quot;threats of a civil war from within and a highly possible spillover from a regional, if not global, war in the South China Sea&quot;, the paper asked, &quot;Will Thailand survive?&quot; From his throne above a vibrant sea of 200,000-odd supporters clad in yellow, the colour of the monarchy, King Bhumibol stressed that political unity had to come from within. &quot;If Thai citizens still hold this harmony in their hearts, there is hope that in whatever the situation, Thailand will surely get through it safely and with stability,&quot; he said. The king has in recent years referred to stability in other speeches but it seemed particularly well- timed. Just last month a former army general tried to lure 1 million Thais to the same plaza to call for the resignation of the prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, alleging that her government was corrupt, anti-monarchy and a puppet to her brother Thaksin, the former prime minister ousted in 2006. Six years on, the country is still bitterly divided among yellow shirts, who support the monarchy, and red shirts, who support Thaksin and who blame the palace \u2013 though not so much the king \u2013 for supporting the coup. The divisions between the two sides are sometimes brutally violent: in 2010, some 2,000 were injured and roughly 100 killed in violent protests between the military and protesters calling for a dissolution of parliament. Discussing the future of Thai politics is no easy task. While the king&apos;s presence pervades many things Thai \u2013 his photos adorn homes and shops, his birthday serves as both a public holiday and Father&apos;s Day, and anecdotes about him filter into school curricula and government projects \u2013 his monarchy is protected by the harshest l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws in the world. Those accused of insulting or threatening the royal family face up to 15 years in prison, and a computer crimes law targets, among other things, those who click &quot;like&quot; or &quot;share&quot; on sites deemed offensive to the monarchy. The heir-apparent to Thailand&apos;s throne is the king&apos;s only son, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, 60, a career army officer who does not enjoy the same popularity as his father and is widely known abroad for his three marriages and spending sprees in Europe. Many Thais hesitate to discuss the subject of succession, though there are rumours that the king could possibly defer succession to the prince&apos;s son instead. This is unlikely, sayssaid a leading Thai academic, Pavin Chachavalpongpun, of Kyoto University&apos;s Centre for Southeast Asian Studies. &quot;If you look at what has happened in the past 100 years [in Thai history], I think it&apos;s quite unlikely that the king would skip the crown prince, because legally it has to be him. If he wants to skip [a generation], he has to give a reason for it, and whether the king would be willing to give that reason [is unclear].&quot; Instead, says Pavin, it seems the palace has been grooming both prince and media for his eventual succession. &quot;There have been attempts in recent years to recreate his image and make him an acceptable candidate, so you see him on television more and more doing royal obligations,&quot; he said. &quot;If he backed off, this would be discomforting.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2012-12-05T17:11:29Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Thaksin Shinawatra"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/05/thailand-unity-king-bhumibol-birthday", "title": "Thai king calls for unity in rare speech", "sentences": ["Hundreds of thousands of Thais armed with flags and cameras crowded around Bangkok&apos;s Royal Plaza to witness a rare public appearance by their revered and ailing king, who celebrated his 85th birthday with a brief speech on national unity from a balcony throne overlooking the cheering masses."]}, {"article": "From what might be music&apos;s least promising premise ever \u2013 Canadian power trio record 20-minute concept piece loosely based on the crackpot libertarianism of Ayn Rand \u2013 Rush somehow conjured their masterpiece.

By Wednesday, though, the current bitterly cold temperatures are expected to have risen to more tolerable levels. Several high-altitude resorts, such as Verbier, Obergurgl, Cervinia, Val Thorens, Val d&apos;Is\u00e8re and Tignes, are already open, along with Arinsal and Pas de la Casa in Andorra. In Courchevel and M\u00e9ribel there is now a metre-and-a-half of snow on Saulire \u2013 the highest point of their joint ski area.  Lifts in Val d&apos;Is\u00e8re and neighbouring Tignes were temporarily closed last week because of 70mph winds and the risk of avalanches. Nick Morgan, managing director of chalet operator Le Ski, said: &quot;A ridiculous amount of snow has fallen in Val d&apos;Is\u00e8re and in Courchevel. It&apos;s a dream start to the season.&quot; In Austria, St Anton, Kitzb\u00fchel, Lech and Saalbach are open, as is the Jungfrau region (Wengen, M\u00fcrren and Grindelwald) in Switzerland.

The torture takes place in an anonymous facility and I suppose you could call it generic in nature: the victim is deprived of sleep, beaten, confined in a small space and waterboarded. Eventually he gives up fragments of information that lead US Navy Seals to Bin Laden&apos;s compound. The obvious conclusion is that without this brutality Bin Laden would be alive and still free to attack the US. But there is a problem with the apparently unflinching realism of Kathryn Bigelow&apos;s film. Drawing on millions of pages of CIA documents, the US Senate intelligence committee has concluded that intelligence work, rather than torture, led to Bin Laden. So, it seems that scenes conceived with the same bent logic as the Fox network TV series 24, where torture was routinely shown to elicit vital information, were included for dramatic, political or even pornographic effect. The realism that Bigelow and her writer, Mark Boal, affect is false because of this inaccuracy about the hunt for Bin Laden, but more importantly because even this explicit scene does not touch the reality of what occurred in the &quot;war on terror&quot;. The reality is much harder to bear. Bigelow should try the story of Sami al-Saadi. Or better still, listen to his daughter Khadija, who gave the most chilling account to the BBC of his rendition to Libya as part of a deal struck with MI6&apos;s Mark Allen, for which the Saadi family is now in receipt of \u00a32.2m from the British government. Imagine the fear of the Saadi kids as they were separated from their parents and flown from Hong Kong to Bangkok, where the plane picked up five of Muammar Gaddafi&apos;s men. They didn&apos;t know their parents were on the plane until it landed at Tripoli and Khadija saw her father handcuffed and with a needle in his arm. Then they met Moussa Koussa, Gaddafi&apos;s intelligence chief, and the years of Saadi&apos;s imprisonment and torture began. Nothing in Bigelow and Boal&apos;s film could capture the terrible effects of rendition and torture on the victims and their families, nor, for that matter, the hypocrisy of western governments that outsourced brutality and whose representatives watched as people were sodomised and electrocuted and cut, while leaders reassured themselves that this was the grown-up world of\u00a0realpolitik. Tony Blair clinched the desert deal with Gaddafi that rendered two of the dictator&apos;s enemies \u2013 Saadi and Abdel Hakim Belhaj \u2013 but now he circles the world with his Faith Foundation. Sir Mark Allen, who apparently dined with Koussa at the Travellers Club and whose correspondence with Gaddafi&apos;s former intelligence chief allowed the two Libyans to bring a case against the British government, muses about the sacred mysteries of religion for the Catholic Herald. This is from Allen&apos;s recent article about the visit of a reliquary of St John Vianney, the Cur\u00e9 d&apos;Ars, to Britain. &quot;The visit of the heart of St John Vianney will reach out to many and touch them in comforting and wonderful ways. Thus, the mysterious power of the holy, its impact and influence, comes into our lives. And we are attracted by it. Our deepest nature responds.&quot; Hold that in your mind and read the note to Koussa after Belhaj and his pregnant wife were rendered to Tripoli. &quot;I congratulate you on the safe arrival of [Belhadj]. This was the least we could do for you and for Libya. I know I did not pay for the air cargo [but] the intelligence [on him] was British.&quot; In another note, Allen was specific about the kidnap of the Saadi children in Hong Kong. Neither I, in the espionage thrillers I have written, nor perhaps even the great John Le Carr\u00e9 could have dreamed up a spy that harbours this particularly ripe hypocrisy. It seems too unbelievable, yet the sanctimonious self-worth evident in Blair, Allen and the former foreign secretary Jack Straw, who, incidentally, seems to have misled the House of Commons on Labour&apos;s involvement with rendition, is precisely what allowed Britain to ignore torture treaties and render men to have their fingernails pulled out. &quot;I feel so angry and sad,&quot; said Khadija. &quot;A country like England is supposed [to] be [a] democracy and support the human rights.&quot; Perhaps Blair and the rest of them did not trouble themselves with visions of what might befall her family, or Belhaj and his wife, yet they let it happen nonetheless, despite their public piety. And that&apos;s the point \u2013 all governments panic and lose their way, and some ministers and civil servants, whatever they tell us about themselves, are capable of behaving very badly indeed. That&apos;s why any proper free society has systems of control and scrutiny, and insists on accountability, even of its intelligence services. It is essential to understand that none of what happened to the Saadis or Belhaj would have come to light had it not been for the chance discovery by Human Rights Watch of documents in Koussa&apos;s office, which established Allen&apos;s eager co-operation on behalf of the UK. The evidence was so strong that the government simply settled with Saadi, even though, of course, it did not have the guts to admit liability. But what would have happened if the justice and security bill, currently going through parliament, had already been passed and the system of secret court hearings was in force. The government would have ordered a &quot;closed material procedure&quot; and fought Saadi in camera, and all the evidence would have been secret, and remained so forever. If this bill passes, the public will be deprived of knowledge of any case that is remotely embarrassing to ministers and spies, and as a result people like Blair, Allen and Straw will be able to act with an absolute lack of public scrutiny \u2013 that is, with impunity. This is a very serious attack on our system of open justice, and what is absolutely without conscience is that the prime minister is now using the Saadi case to argue that secret courts will increase rather than diminish the justice available in Britain. As the campaign group Reprieve suggests, politicians are simply not to be trusted with a dangerous new power that closes off courts for their own convenience. In camera or on camera, the subject of torture is too serious for politicians to be allowed to hide in secret courts and for filmmakers to reduce the experience of endless pain and despair so that it seems just about justifiable.", "publicationDate": "2012-12-16T00:06:00Z", "tags": ["Rendition", "Justice and security act", "Law", "MI6", "Libya", "Moussa Koussa", "Foreign policy", "Politics", "US foreign policy", "UK news", "Zero Dark Thirty"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/16/rendition-zero-dark-thirty-secret-services", "title": "Rendition, Zero Dark Thirty and the brutal reality of Britain's secret services", "sentences": ["Imagine the fear of the Saadi kids as they were separated from their parents and flown from Hong Kong to Bangkok, where the plane picked up five of Muammar Gaddafi&apos;s men."]}, {"article": "Lotus have confirmed that Romain Grosjean will remain with Kimi Raikkonen for the 2013 Formula One season.

Sandiford also faces fines of 2bn rupiah (\u00a3127,000) or an additional six months in prison. Customs officials were said to have found almost 5kg of cocaine in her luggage when she landed at the island&apos;s Ngurah Rai airport in May. Some reports have put the amount lower, at 3.7kg. Paul Beales, another Briton, received a four-year sentence on Wednesday for the illegal possession of 3.1g of cannabis while Rachel Dougall was sentenced to one year in prison in a separate trial on Thursday for failing to report a crime to authorities. Her partner Julian Ponder, a former antiques restorer with whom she lives in a villa on the island, is charged with conspiring to import, smuggle and exchange drugs and being part of a drug syndicate, it has been reported. Dougall, Ponder and Beales were arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking at the end of May along with an Indian man. Dougall and Ponder, both from Brighton, West Sussex have claimed they were &quot;set up&quot; by Sandiford. A verdict on Sandiford, who comes from Redcar on Teesside and also lived in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, is expected to be handed down in early January. Indonesia has extremely strict drug laws; convicted smugglers often face the death sentence, although foreigners seldom receive it. Sandford, who has two adult sons, has become a grandmother since her arrest. Her supporters at human rights group Reprieve said she had never been in trouble with the police before but, in March 2012, she agreed to carry a suitcase from Bangkok, Thailand to Bali, because she was convinced her son would be in danger from criminal gangs if she refused. She also had mental health issues. Dr Jennifer Fleetwood, an expert on the drugs trade, submitted written testimony to the court that, in her professional opinion, Sandiford &quot;was subjected to coercion by one or more parties over a period of time&quot; and that her &quot;vulnerability will have made her an ideal target for drugs traffickers&quot;. Harriet McCulloch, an investigator at Reprieve, said: &quot;Lindsay has been through a terrible experience \u2013 she was exploited by drug traffickers, who targeted her because of her vulnerability and her fear for the safety of her children. She was interrogated by the Indonesian police without a translator, legal representation or the assistance of the British embassy for 10 days. It would have been unthinkable for the prosecution to demand her execution. We hope that the judges take all of this into consideration when handing down their verdict.&quot; Sentencing Dougall, judges said they had taken into consideration the fact that she was a mother and had co-operated with investigations.
