Stephen Ashton, 22, is said to have been shot as he danced with friends at a beach bar on the island of Koh Phangan. Colonel Kittakarn Kramomthong, chief of police at the island&apos;s station, said officers had arrested a 26-year-old Thai man and confiscated a gun. The man had apparently gone into hiding in the island&apos;s mountainous interior. He was expected to be charged with manslaughter, Kittakarn said. A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed the dead man was Ashton, and said: &quot;We are aware of the death of a British national in Thailand on New Year&apos;s Eve and we are providing consular assistance to the family.&quot; It was reported that Ashton&apos;s family had travelled to Thailand and were on the way to Koh Phangan to formally identify his body and make arrangements for his repatriation. Kittakarn told the Bangkok Post that Ashton was with a group of friends and 300 other tourists at the 2013 countdown party at the Zoom Bar on Haad Rin beach when he was shot by a homemade gun early on Tuesday. According to witnesses who spoke to police investigators, an argument broke out between two groups of locals at the Zoom Bar, one of the many beachside venues that line Haad Rin. As one of the men walked away from the bar he reportedly pulled out a gun and fired into the crowd, hitting Ashton in the chest. Ashton was taken to Bandon International hospital but could not be revived. The Bangkok Post said Ashton had been visiting the island with four or five friends and was staying at Pink Bungalow near the scene of the shooting. Koh Phangan has been a popular destination for British backpackers and hippies for decades, but in recent years it has established itself as a mainstream party venue with hundreds of thousands of tourists from around the world flocking to the island for its famous &quot;full moon&quot; parties. Locals had been bracing themselves for a deluge of extra tourists at the weekend because the full moon \u2013 which fell on Friday \u2013 coincided with the new year celebrations. According to tourism officials, 80,000 turned up for Friday&apos;s full moon party and tens of thousands more were expected to see in 2013 at Haad Rin. The island&apos;s growing popularity has led to increased wealth but also growing security fears. The Foreign Office says seven British nationals have been murdered in Thailand since January 2009, and it picks out Koh Phangan as a potential flashpoint. Its official travel advice states: &quot;Western tourists have been victims of vicious unprovoked attacks by gangs in Koh Phangan. These attacks are particularly common around the time of the full moon parties and generally occur late at night near bars in Haad Rin. Exercise caution when walking in this area at any time, especially after dark.&quot; Sophie Harwin, a graphics editor from Surrey who spent New Year&apos;s Eve nearby but had left the area by the time the shooting occurred, said. &quot;I just met someone who said that loads of people were trying to save him. Very sad.&quot; Tributes to Ashton were posted on social networking sites as news of the shooting spread. Aaron Kelly wrote on Facebook: &quot;Horrible news. Be good up there mate.&quot; Jaydon Gibbs said on Twitter: &quot;My heart is with his family. The nicest guy RIP Stephen Ashton xx.&quot; Another Twitter user, Dean DeRosa, said: &quot;Worst news for the start of 2013! R.I.P Stephen Ashton! Was a good lad!!&quot; Robbie-Cameron Gray posted a photograph of the two of them as young boys on Ashton&apos;s Facebook page. He said: &quot;Don&apos;t want to believe it. Still got photos of us on my wall from football and school. Will miss you mate.&quot; Neighbour Dawn Mason, 48, described Ashton as a &quot;very normal, likable young man&quot;. His family moved to Purley, south London, about three years ago, she said. &quot;They&apos;ve always been very nice neighbours. I went to the house and the family just seem in complete shock,&quot; she added. Ashton&apos;s mother, Diane, was flying back to Britain from a skiing trip following news of her son&apos;s death, Mason said.

Stephen Ashton, 22, was caught in the crossfire of a gun fight between two groups of locals at a crowded beach bar on the island of Koh Phangan. His family said they were &quot;completely devastated&quot; by his death. Ekkapan Kaewkla, 26, has been initially charged with premeditated murder and illegal possession of a weapon, according to the Bangkok Post, which said he confessed to the crime in a police interrogation. Police had earlier suggested he would likely be charged with manslaughter. Kaewkla was transferred to the larger neighbouring island of Koh Samui, where there is a court, and has been remanded in custody, according to the BBC. He was expected to spend the day in detention while the police prepared the charges against him. He can be detained for up to 84 days. Kaewkla was arrested on Tuesday while hiding in a makeshift hut on a mountain near the beach, police said. The British ambassador to Thailand, Mark Kent, is expected to visit the crime scene on Thursday. Footage emerged on Wednesday of Kaewkla and Thai police carrying out a reconstruction of events.

A fresh start suddenly seems possible. But is there any such thing? Most of\u00a0us have fantasies about starting again from scratch \u2013 particularly in our relationships. By the time you have been in a marriage for 10 years or so, it&apos;s like a taxi cab that has been working the streets of Bangkok \u2013 characterful, but beaten, battered, with\u00a0scratched paint and windows that get stuck. The fantasy of starting again is universal. The most potent words in the advertisers&apos; lexicon are New! and Improved! We talk of those New Year&apos;s favourites, &quot;purification&quot; and &quot;detoxification&quot; as if they could render\u00a0our organs, bones and muscles newly generated. But can relationships be renewed? Does even leaving them really give you a fresh start? No. There are no fresh starts \u2013 there are only inflections on patterns laid down long ago. This does not mean that we cannot\u00a0improve the relationship we are\u00a0in. But it&apos;s a slow, incremental process, usually with a two-steps-forward-one-step-back pattern. People are complex, creatures of habit, and reluctant to change. The closest I ever get to a fresh start,\u00a0strangely enough, is when someone close to me dies. Bereavement somehow cleans the windscreen of the soul, sieves out all the dreck, if only for a short time. You see straight. But the cold, glittering glass soon mists over again. The trouble is, just as we take ourselves with us wherever we travel, we always take ourselves with ourselves into the future. A new partner, a new resolution does not change us. We are too deeply ingrained in too many ways. This is not only true when we are old. I believe I&apos;m the same old slob at heart that I was when I was in my 20s. Dennis Potter always said that he spent\u00a0his life waiting for a revelation that was just round the corner that never arrived. I have often had the same feeling. I know that I am different to how I was 30 years ago \u2013 but I am, at some levels, exactly the same. And any changes I have been through have not come from resolutions or flexing of willpower, but through the hammering out of circumstance. And this is why even having been through two marriages, I face the same complaints from my partners \u2013 and to some extent, have the same complaints against them. Yet I am not despairing about this apparent intractability. People in relationships can amend, somewhat, long-established patterns of behaviour, so long is there is goodwill on both sides. And we tend to give the past rather too much power in our definition of the future. After all, it is not the past that purely creates the present \u2013 the present also creates the past. A real fresh start in a relationship would, in a sense, be to give up looking for fresh starts \u2013 to stop looking over your shoulder at the past, which needs to be escaped from, and the future, at which you are anxious to arrive. In reality, there is only now and this present moment, and it&apos;s a question of negotiating that moment \u2013 if negotiating is the right word. Perhaps live the moment is better. This is, of course, a Buddhist point of view (not that I am a Buddhist). Buddhists also say all authentic action is unmediated and spontaneous. This is where a fresh start lies \u2013 with the realisation that the past and the future are entirely artificial, not with goals and targets and the straining of sinews and tendons of your so-called will. This does not mean you can&apos;t change things \u2013 it just means that you can&apos;t change things by endlessly pontificating on how you&apos;re going to change things. The fresh start is inside. The only change you can really make is to realise that. \u2022 Follow Tim on Twitter @timlottwriter", "publicationDate": "2013-01-05T00:05:43Z", "tags": ["New year", "Buddhism", "Religion", "World news", "Family", "Life and style"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jan/05/tim-lott-contemplates-fresh-start", "title": "Man about the house", "sentences": ["By the time you have been in a marriage for 10 years or so, it&apos;s like a taxi cab that has been working the streets of Bangkok \u2013 characterful, but beaten, battered, with\u00a0scratched paint and windows that get stuck."]}, {"article": "So far our January online Q&amp;As have tackled Family Travel and Self-Catering Holidays in the UK and Europe \u2013\u00a0browse the comments sections in each article to see the advice.

Two years ago, ministers signed up to the Bangkok Rules \u2013 new UN standards for the treatment of women offenders. Yet the first analysis into how the UK has performed found that, contrary to its responsibilities, it is wrongly imprisoning large numbers of women who pose no threat to society and is not taking into account the human rights of children affected by their mothers&apos; imprisonment. The report also confirmed that &quot;shocking&quot; levels of self-harm persist among female inmates. Although monitoring of the UK&apos;s 15 women&apos;s prisons revealed almost 9,000 self-harm cases in 2011, a significant drop from more than 12,000 the previous year, the figure still remains too high, according to campaigners. The figures mean that women prisoners account for a fifth of self-harm cases across the UK penal estate despite making up only 5% of the prison population, although the number of female prisoners has fallen during the past year from 4,282 to 3,918. The report says that the approach to dealing with mental health among female inmates is inadequate and that those in control need to start discussing currently ignored themes including &quot;patriarchy, identity, shame, love, attachment, feminism, loss, abuse and equality of opportunity&quot;. Rachel Halford, director of campaign group Women in Prison, which compiled the report, said: &quot;There are still too many women unnecessarily imprisoned, too many women hurting themselves in prison and too many women reoffending on release.&quot; Prisons reformer Baroness Stern said the findings revealed that six years after the critical Corston report called for a &quot;distinct, radically different, visibly led, strategic, proportionate, holistic, woman-centred, integrated approach&quot;, in truth &quot;little has fundamentally changed.&quot; The chief inspector of prisons, Nick Hardwick, warned last year that the way women are treated in prisons will leave England and Wales &quot;aghast and ashamed&quot; in years to come. Hardwick described terrible levels of self-mutilation and admitted that the distressing sights he encountered in one women&apos;s unit had kept him awake at night. Among the inmates interviewed for the report were those who admitted they had contemplated suicide. Others said they felt isolated and that they had no one to turn to. One woman said that the attitude of prison officers &quot;stinks&quot; while another said that there was a &quot;lot of bullying, but staff don&apos;t always do anything&quot;. A government review of women&apos;s prisons is to be completed by the summer, following the announcement that seven public-sector prisons are to close by March and two more partially shut in England and Wales to help cut costs. Justice minister Helen Grant said: &quot;The government is committed to addressing women&apos;s offending and providing services for their specific needs, making sure they are rehabilitated whether they serve sentences in prison or the community. &quot;We are putting in place measures that ensure crimes are met with proportionate punishment that is both tough and meaningful in order to reduce reoffending and promote rehabilitation.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-01-27T00:07:52Z", "tags": ["Prisons and probation", "Law", "UK criminal justice", "Society", "Women", "Life and style", "UK news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jan/27/women-wrongly-imprisoned", "title": "Hundreds of women still wrongly imprisoned", "sentences": ["Two years ago, ministers signed up to the Bangkok Rules \u2013 new UN standards for the treatment of women offenders."]}, {"article": "Chefs don't make the best restaurateurs. I&nbsp;know, I know, hysterical overstatement, but many successful restaurants are all about the customer rather than the ego in the kitchen. They're run by strangers to the stoves: Chris Corbin and Jeremy King (the Delaunay, the Wolseley); Will Beckett (the Hawksmoor group); Leonid Shutov and Richard Howarth of my beloved Bob Bob Ricard. \nAnd Naamyaa's boss, Alan Yau, a&nbsp;man often described as visionary. With good reason: it's easy to forget that rabid restaurant queues weren't always for burgers; they were once for Yau's much imitated Wagamama and Busaba Eathai. One of his more inspired moves is an association with that least egotistical of chefs, David Thompson, world authority on Thai food and all-round lovely chap. Sadly, he's returned to Bangkok by the time I visit, but since this is clearly the prototype for a series of Naamyaas, it would be naive to expect his constant presence. \nThe mainly Thai-Malay menu is full of grainy photographs of set meals and bristles with curiosities: sadtor, or \"stink\", beans, bitter melon soup; they fly in kanom jin from Bangkok, fresh, marshmallowy-textured noodles made from fermented rice and the vehicle for curried fish sauce. There's an anomalous and unappealing parade of western junk favourites \u2013 chilli dogs and burgers \u2013 and, just in case you've drifted off, Puy lentil and feta salad. \nIt's meant to reference Bangkok's eclectic cafes \u2013 ones I clearly missed on my travels. For one thing, Naamyaa is beautiful in a brilliantly modern, sui generis way. Ziggurated rows of peachy Thai brick display row after row of golden Bodhisattvas. Vast windows illuminate a bustling open kitchen. And I'm properly in lust with the Thai-flavoured Toile de Jouy wall tiles, looking like France has gone drugged-up backpacking. \nService is equally enchanting. What does Yau put in staff meals? This is the kind of bushy-tailed love bombing you'd expect from a&nbsp;cult. They're so solicitous it makes me want to complain just to give them something to do. And I could: I'm not sure when the kanom jin were flown in, but these are a bit knackered and sticking to each other for support; their tomato and soybean \"naamyaa jay\", however, is wonderfully pungent and throbbing with aromatics, and I&nbsp;like its pickled morning glory and chocolate truffle-textured \"60 degree\" eggs, too. \nGrilled sirloin salad features tough, stringy meat and is uncompromisingly sour. And the som tam salad that comes with Isaarn chicken and sticky rice (a&nbsp;northern Thai classic) looks fresh and innocuous with its green papaya and string beans, but its quantities of bird's-eye chillies make me choke and glug my drink. Which is, alas, a&nbsp;Bloody Naamyaa featuring \"umami salt\" and \"smoked water\". (Me: \"How do you smoke water?\" Server: \"Um, there's a kind of gun.\") The definition of fighting fire with fire. \nNaamyaa does not fear the sting of capsaicin. The laksa is so ruthlessly fiery, it makes my ears rattle \u2013 and I&nbsp;get off on heat. This is a Thai take on the Malaysian staple, rich with coconut milk, more hefty curry than soup. It doesn't so much ride roughshod over its squid, prawns and pneumatic fishballs as stomp all over them with hobnailed boots. Thank goodness, then, for the salve of green melon soup \u2013 but, argh, oodles of white pepper. Pudding is kind of deliciously revolting: young coconut set firmly, like a stout pannacotta, and pocked with bouncy black tapioca balls. But soothing, so soothing: Germolene for the tortured palate. \nI genuinely believe Yau is some kind of genius. From that easily Google-able name to the faux-sleazy LED light display, Naamyaa is like nothing else in town. I'd be happy to&nbsp;eat beans on toast here, cosseted by beaming cult members and blessed by glittering Bodhisattvas, but you can get Hakkasan-style jasmine tea-smoked baby back ribs and Mekhong whisky and gr\u00fcner veltliner.

The new rules are intended to give local and foreign reporters greater access to government officials and will come into effect around mid-April, deputy minister for information and presidential spokesman U Ye Htut said told the Guardian. &quot;In the past, the government issued journalist visas to try to control the journalist&apos;s movements,&quot; he said. &quot;Now we are issuing the visa to allow the journalist access to the ministries \u2026 If he wants to interview a government official but doesn&apos;t have a journalist visa, he may not get access [to the official].&quot; The move, which means reporters will no longer have to fly in using tourist visas or file under pseudonyms, follows the recent dismantling of some, but not all, of Burma&apos;s draconian censorship laws and the seeming removal of most foreign journalists from the country&apos;s blacklists. It also follows training sessions overseen by Unesco and local media late last year aimed at teaching government ministers how to deal with the press, U Ye Htut said. &quot;In the past, many journalists would enter Myanmar [Burma] with tourist visas, so if [government officials] made the mistake of talking with journalists, they would lose their job. That is why they are very careful, and sometimes very reluctant, to talk with foreign journalists,&quot; he explained. Each ministry now has its own spokesperson to deal with media inquiries, as ordered by President Thein Sein. A former general who came to power in 2011, Thein Sein has initiated extensive political and economic reforms in a country formerly ruled for five decades by a military junta, which kept the news highly censored and the ministers tight-lipped. The new media regulations will require journalists to submit a CV and letter of recommendation from their media outlet for official approval. If granted, reporters will be issued with free press cards, as well as visas for the period of time they intend to work in Burma. Journalists travelling in and out of the country could be granted multi-entry visas of between three and six months, the minister said, while visas of up to one year will be given to those intending to open a foreign news bureau. Reporters who enter the country on tourist visas after the new rules come into effect and choose to report will not be penalised for doing so unofficially, U Ye Htut said, though they may have difficulty securing official interviews. He added that local reporters will be granted their own press cards through the Independent Press Council around April as well. Rights groups gave the news a cautious welcome, warning that it was still not known how visa criteria would be assessed, or whether journalists would be allowed to criticise the government and report freely. &quot;This could be a positive development towards greater media freedom in Burma because in the past, ministers and military officials would never speak with foreign journalists,&quot; said the Committee to Protect Journalists&apos; south-east Asian representative, Shawn Crispin. &quot;But we have some journalists here in Bangkok who were allowed [into Burma] last year and reported somewhat critically, and now they are seeing long delays in the processing of their next journalist visas, some for two or three months already.&quot; Another unknown was whether the country&apos;s new media censorship guidelines \u2013 released in August last year \u2013 would also apply to foreign journalists living and working in Burma, said Phil Robertson, of Human Rights Watch. They include regulations that &quot;the state, and economic policies of the state, will not be negatively criticised&quot;, among others. Local and foreign journalists reporting about Burma may also have been the target of a recent mass email hack by &quot;state-sponsored attackers&quot;, although it is not yet clear who or where those attackers may be. The email hacks follow a series of cyberattacks on various Burmese media outlets, including weekly journal The Voice and the Eleven media group, although the government&apos;s own website was also targeted three times last week, the Myanmar Times reported.", "publicationDate": "2013-02-11T18:29:41Z", "tags": ["Press freedom", "World news", "Newspapers & magazines", "Newspapers", "Media", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/11/burma-offers-visas-journalists", "title": "Burma offers visas to journalists", "sentences": ["&quot;But we have some journalists here in Bangkok who were allowed [into Burma] last year and reported somewhat critically, and now they are seeing long delays in the processing of their next journalist visas, some for two or three months already.&quot; Another unknown was whether the country&apos;s new media censorship guidelines \u2013 released in August last year \u2013 would also apply to foreign journalists living and working in Burma, said Phil Robertson, of Human Rights Watch."]}, {"article": "There are poppy fields above the city of Carcassonne in south-western France, and quiet houses with windows so tightly shuttered they appear to be in a permanent state of repose. The higher you get up the mountain, the closer the air becomes; there&apos;s a place where the road forks into two \u2013 a little scrap of fenced-off land in the middle planted with fruit trees and a hammock strung up in the shade. It is here, on an afternoon like this, that if you&apos;re lucky, you might catch a glimpse of Kevin Ayers. Ayers has been living in voluntary exile in France for longer than he can remember; something about England never sat right with him. Forty years ago, when Soft Machine released their first album and toured the world with Jimi Hendrix, Ayers \u2013 lead vocalist and bass player, then 24 \u2013 gave up and fled to Ibiza. There, he later said, he &quot;lived on nothing \u2013 fruit from the trees and the fish that I caught every day&quot;. His first solo album, Joy of a Toy, was a piece of psychedelic whimsy with songs such as Eleanor&apos;s Cake (Which Ate Her) and The Lady Rachel, while the demos for his first single Singing a Song in the Morning, originally featured Syd Barrett \u2013 although by the time it came to the final cut, the ex-Floyd frontman was too far into his mental meltdown to remember the chords. The Whole World, a band featuring a young Mike Oldfield on bass, was assembled for a second LP, Shooting At the Moon, and Ayers was back in the limelight, hailed as a new David Bowie. He cancelled the promotional tour after a few dates, though, and aborted the group just as it was taking off. The industry chased him, and the solo records kept coming through the 70s, with songs about bananas and girls in white dresses, eight-minute prog experiments and spoken-word tracks. Ayers slept with countless women \u2013 from Lady Aspinall to Nico, from the wife of John Cale to the girlfriend of Lou Reed. He lived with Brian Eno in Maida Vale, and it was at one of Ayers&apos; famous house parties in July 1973 that Robert Wyatt, drunk and caught with the wrong girl, fell out of an upstairs window and was permanently paralysed from the waist down. Later in the decade Ayers would once more head off in search of the sun, setting up home in Provence, Majorca and Minorca, and by the close of the 70s he had gone to ground completely. In 2007 he released a new album, The Unfairground, which reunited him with many from the old scene, including Wyatt, whom he claimed he hadn&apos;t seen for 30 years. It seemed to spell a new lease of life but a major tour of Europe and America, planned for that summer, has just been abruptly cancelled. Approaching the strange little pen in the mountains now \u2013 the hammock rounded with some human form and the tip of a fisherman&apos;s hat just visible through the trees \u2013 I&apos;m not quite sure what I&apos;m going to find. Kevin Ayers is perching rather uncomfortably on the edge of the hammock. He rises to meet me \u2013 6ft 2ins tall, dressed in a tattered velvet jacket and white trainers, and winces. He broke four ribs a few months back and has a fresh cut on the palm of his right hand from a fall he took earlier in the day. He removes his hat and scratches his messy blond hair, then covers up again self-consciously when he realises his face is exposed in the sun. I can&apos;t be sure, but I suspect that the ribs \u2013 broken in a barroom brawl \u2013 are an excuse to keep popping the tablets he carries around in a blue plastic carrier bag \u2013 &quot;my vitamin bag&quot;, as he calls it. Unsteady on his feet and mortally embarrassed to be seen or spoken to, Kevin Ayers is in several strange kinds of pain. &quot;Did you see the nunnery down in the village?&quot; he asks, fumbling a tiny roll-up. He sounds like a BBC broadcaster from the 1950s, his accent almost colonially refined, rich and sibilant, every T delicately crossed. &quot;It&apos;s very strange,&quot; he goes on. &quot;There are about 5,000 nuns in there but you never see any of them coming out.&quot; We&apos;re in surreal territory, and he&apos;s brightening up. &quot;I think they are fed into some kind of giant sausage machine,&quot; he says, &quot;or made into dog food perhaps.&quot; By the time we get into his car, he&apos;s drunk at least two bottles of wine and is winding down for a sedative-soaked siesta. For some reason I&apos;m optimistic about making it down the mountainside in one piece. At worst we&apos;ll end up with a couple of broken ribs, I tell myself, and besides, Kevin Ayers is probably still too much of a gentleman to crash me. Ayer&apos;s childhood was posh, lonely and miserable. His father was Rowan Ayers, the BBC broadcaster and creator of The Open Door and co-creator of The Old Grey Whistle Test, and when his parents&apos; marriage ended he was farmed out to live with his grandmother. His mother, &quot;a cold woman with a fierce Catholic guilt complex and a desire for self-improvement,&quot; set up home in Malaysia with a new husband, an army officer, and when they eventually sent for him he made the journey alone, at the age of six \u2013 a three-day trek to the far east with a stopover at Bangkok. &quot;I was the only white boy among 80 pupils at school, and I spoke no Malaysian. Then they put me in a Catholic boarding school full of homosexual priests who were always trying to get into my pants because I was blond and looked like an angel.&quot; Back in England, Ayers was sent to &quot;any school that would have me&quot;. Some expelled him, and some he escaped; the names and locations are of no interest to him now, but one of them was the Simon Langton grammar school in Canterbury, where he met future Soft Machine members Robert Wyatt and Mike Ratledge, whose friendship represented &quot;the first experience of intimacy, the first family I ever had&quot;. He tried to live with his father in Chelsea but it backfired and he ended up on the streets &quot;conning&quot;, which is basically taking money for sexual favours and then trying to run away. A car passes us by a hair&apos;s breadth and the French driver jabs a finger sideways to signal, &quot;get over the other side of the freaking road.&quot; Kevin Ayers checks whether I&apos;ve got my seatbelt on. We stop at his house for emergency supplies and he comes back to the car with seven bottles of wine.  Je suis un rock star \u2026 Je habiter la, dans la south of France \u2026  The Bill Wyman hit of the 80s conjures images of a mini-chateau, a trout farm and a recording studio, PRS cheques and a comfortable life of food, drink and real estate. The Ayers residence is a tall, shuttered place at the end of a narrow street, built into the side of a gorge. The garden is on three levels with lichen-covered balustrades descending steeply and all sorts of greenery jostling together. It&apos;s redolent of an old cemetery and there&apos;s a strange, tropical ozone smell, rich in neglect. Overripe peaches spill from paper bags on the kitchen table and bits of buddleia blossom, faded and brown, have blown in on to the floor. There&apos;s a small CD system on the dresser, half a dozen albums piled on top of it. One is by the Gaelic singer Julie Fowlis (&quot;yes, someone gave me that&quot;) and the others are by Kevin Ayers \u2013 The Unfairground, Whatevershebringswesing, Shooting at the Moon among them, all covered in dust. It looks as though they have been put there by someone else, to remind him who he is. Throughout the 80s, Kevin Ayers was a heroin addict. He once received an entire portable studio as a gift from Mike Oldfield, and sold it to support his habit. His musical partner, Ollie Halsall of Patto, another &quot;next big thing&quot; from the early 70s, was his drug buddy \u2013 until he died of an overdose in 1992. His death weaned Ayers off the stuff, but there is something about this house \u2013 dishevelled and unfurnished \u2013 that speaks of those former times. The bedrooms, and there are many, don&apos;t contain any bookshelves, or clothes, or clutter. He shows me his bed \u2013 green plush velvet \u2013 but each of the others appears to have been slept in too, the sure sign of an insomniac. He takes me to a room painted red, with the beginnings of a gold leaf design on one part of the wall. &quot;This is the room with the woman&apos;s touch,&quot; he says. He&apos;s referring to an American barmaid half his age who&apos;d lived there on and off until about five years ago. The house misses her. If there is one thing Kevin Ayers can talk about freely \u2013 needs to talk about \u2013 it&apos;s love. &quot;I can&apos;t write songs unless I am in love,&quot; he states. &quot;And I have always been that way. If I am not in love, nothing is meaningful to me. I have no energy.&quot; At the top of the house there is something that could once have been a nursery, &quot;where I put children if I have them.&quot; He has several, in fact, all grown up now, and he&apos;s in regular contact with Galen, his daughter by Richard Bransen&apos;s ex-wife Kirsten, a deal with Virgin Records in the 70s having proved fruitful in more ways than one. There is an old typewriter that no longer works up here, too, and a four-track tape-recorder that, over the course of three years, he used to put down songs for The Unfairground. There are no musical instruments and few other signs of his professional activity. I ask him how he writes his music now and feel instantly as though I&apos;ve embarrassed him. Out in the garden, a pint of neat Pernod in his hand, Kevin Ayers changes places with me so the sun is on my face and his is in the shade. I am bemused at his lack of physical confidence \u2013 he did a few small gigs in France two years ago and insisted that the venues were set in near-darkness. If he compared himself to other men in their mid 60s he&apos;d feel a lot better. But that&apos;s missing the point, really, because somewhere down the line, on the shores of Ibiza or Morocco 40 years ago, Kevin Ayers&apos;s mind seems to have been frozen in time. There is something unshakable about his attitude \u2013 his romanticism, his sedateness, the curious self-indulgence despite the impoverished circumstances \u2013 that sets him apart from those caricatures of the 60s bent on some kind of nostalgia trip. &quot;I have always denied that there was a Canterbury scene,&quot; he says matter-of-factly when I ask him about the early days. &quot;There were no more than half-a-dozen people doing what we were doing \u2013 in a cathedral city that had its quota of real wankers. People would hit on me because I had a posh accent. Mike Ratledge got a first in philosophy at Oxford and Robert Wyatt came from a literary background. That was the thing that drew us together, really.&quot; &quot;The thing about Soft Machine and me,&quot; he goes on slowly, &quot;was that I never considered another profession. My only other desire was to do as little as possible. Honestly, I just assume that whatever is going to happen to me is going to happen. There it goes: someone is there, someone isn&apos;t there. This girl is here. This food is here. I think the clever people are the ones who do a little as possible.&quot; In a strange kind of way, Kevin Ayers is living bang in the present \u2013 his present. If he were feeding off the memory of his early career, he would be doing more to keep it alive. In fact, as I learn later, when he saw the dates for his planned tour in the summer of 2008 \u2013 in Europe and the US \u2013 he broke down and hospitalised himself with alcohol and painkillers. It was 1969 when he first cancelled a tour. This is not a man who is &quot;past it&quot; but a man who has not changed a bit. The village is bedding down for the night and late in the evening, on the street outside his house, Kevin Ayers emerges carrying, to my surprise, an acoustic guitar. It&apos;s the first voluntary sign of his musical life that he has given me. No one dares look at him or make a fuss, anxious not to put him off, and sitting in a doorway, Ayers starts to play an old blues song. His voice rings out loud, confident and unmistakable on the cobbled street, lagging lazily just behind the beat. One by one, people creep up on the street to listen. A couple of old French people open their shutters and look down. He finishes. &quot;Play May I!&quot; someone calls, wanting to hear a Kevin Ayers composition. &quot;How about Lady Rachel?&quot; They just don&apos;t get it. &quot;I can&apos;t do those songs,&quot; he says quietly, with a waver of frustration. &quot;Because I don&apos;t know the words and the chords.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-02-21T10:43:52Z", "tags": ["Music", "Psychedelia", "Folk music", "Culture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/21/kevin-ayers-final-interview", "title": "Kevin Ayers: 'I never considered another profession' \u2013 one of his final interviews", "sentences": ["His mother, &quot;a cold woman with a fierce Catholic guilt complex and a desire for self-improvement,&quot; set up home in Malaysia with a new husband, an army officer, and when they eventually sent for him he made the journey alone, at the age of six \u2013 a three-day trek to the far east with a stopover at Bangkok."]}, {"article": "DKNY is to donate $25,000 to compensate a photographer whose photos the company was caught using without permission.  Brandon Stanton, a New York street photographer who runs Humans of New York, a popular photo blog detailing the lives of the city&apos;s most colourful residents, was approached several months ago by the fashion label, which was interested in buying 300 of his photos. According to Stanton, DKNY offered him $15,000 for 300 of his photos, which it wanted to hang in its storefronts worldwide.  &quot;A friend in the industry told me that $50 per photo was not nearly enough to receive from a company with hundreds of millions of dollars \u2026 So I asked for more money. [DKNY] said &apos;no&apos;,&quot; said Stanton in a statement posted on Humans of New York&apos;s Facebook page, which reaches over 562,000 people.  But on Monday, one of Stanton&apos;s fans sent him a picture of a DKNY store in Bangkok. &quot;The window is full of my photos. These photos were used without my knowledge and without compensation,&quot; said Stanton on Facebook.  Rather than immediately threatening DKNY with a lawsuit, Stanton posted on Facebook on Monday morning and asked his fans to &quot;share&quot; his post if they agreed with him that DKNY should donate $100,000 on his behalf to his local YMCA, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. Over 28,907 people shared his post in under 5 hours \u2013 which clearly got DKNY&apos;s attention. The company issued an apology, which Stanton reposted on Humans of New York&apos;s Facebook page, in which it pledged to donate $25,000 in Stanton&apos;s name to the YMCA. The company said it was a mistake, as the store in Bangkok used &quot;an internal mock up containing some of Mr Stanton&apos;s images, that was intended to merely show the direction of the spring visual program.&quot; Stanton told his Facebook fans: &quot;$25k will help a lot of kids at the YMCA \u2026 we are going to take them at their word that it was a mistake and be happy that this one had a happy ending.&quot; Fighting back against image theft is becoming a common trend among photographers who share their content online and via social media. Just this month, photographers complained that Instagram wasn&apos;t doing enough to prevent image theft and began publicizing instances of image theft in order to ask for proper compensation.  In the statement from DKNY, posted on Stanton&apos;s Facebook page, the company said: &quot;For our Spring 2013 store window visuals we decided to celebrate the city that is in our name by showcasing &apos;Only in NYC&apos; images.

Prajob Nao-opas, 43, was shot four times in broad daylight in Chacheongsao province, 20 miles east of Bangkok, after spending the past year fighting illegal toxic waste disposal by various industrial estates in the region. &quot;The cold-blooded killing of Prajob marks yet another example of the fundamental failure of Thai authorities to protect activists who risk their lives while defending their communities,&quot; said Human Rights Watch&apos;s Asia director, Brad Adams. More than 30 human rights defenders and environmentalists have been killed in Thailand since 2001, Adams said, with suspects charged in fewer than one in five cases. On Monday, Prajob was at a garage waiting for mechanics to finish work on his pickup truck when a gunman arrived at the scene, approached Prajob, fired four shots with an 11mm semi-automatic weapon and escaped. Prajob was rushed to hospital but died on the way. Local police said the murder was the mark of a professional hitman and that it was likely Prajob&apos;s activism had made him a target, the Bangkok Post reported. Prajob&apos;s campaigning had made national headlines over the exposed waterways and farmland full of industrial runoff in Chacheongsao, where carcinogens had been found at levels 30 times their legal limit, according to the provincial health office. Prajob had allegedly been warned by police in December that he might be in danger and in January purchased two pistols to protect himself. According to Human Rights Watch, he regularly reported that he was being shadowed by unknown men on motorcycles and in vehicles, including the same car that was allegedly used in his murder. An official overseeing the toxic disposal in Chacheongsao told the Associated Press that Prajob&apos;s murder &quot;only goes to show that the toxic waste dumping is a big issue that needs national and international attention, since there is likely something else the dumpers were trying to bury&quot;. Pongin Intarakhao added that his agency, the department of special investigations, would continue to fight the dumping and that investigators had already pressed charges against a Thai man accused of overseeing toxic disposal. But Adams warned that more needed to be done to bring the perpetrators to justice. &quot;Police investigations have been characterised by half-hearted, inconsistent and inefficient police work, and an unwillingness to tackle questions of collusion between political influences and interests and these killings of activists,&quot; he said.", "publicationDate": "2013-02-27T12:06:54Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Activism", "Protest", "Environment", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Human rights", "Law"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/27/murder-environmentalist-thailand-failure", "title": "Murder of environmentalist 'highlights Thailand's failure to protect activists'", "sentences": ["Prajob Nao-opas, 43, was shot four times in broad daylight in Chacheongsao province, 20 miles east of Bangkok, after spending the past year fighting illegal toxic waste disposal by various industrial estates in the region.", "Local police said the murder was the mark of a professional hitman and that it was likely Prajob&apos;s activism had made him a target, the Bangkok Post reported."]}, {"article": "Thailand has agreed for the first time to hold peace talks with Muslim militants in the south of the country, an apparent breakthrough towards ending a nearly decade-long conflict that has claimed more than 5,000 lives. Senior Thai government officials signed the deal on Thursday with members of the Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN) in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, where they agreed to launch a &quot;dialogue process&quot; in the southern border provinces. They gave no date for future meetings. The agreement was signed ahead of a meeting later on Thursday between Thailand&apos;s prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, and her Malaysian counterpart, Najib Razak, after which further details would be made public, Malaysian officials said.\u00a0 &quot;God willing we&apos;ll do our best to solve the problem,&quot; said BRN&apos;s Hassan Taib after a brief signing ceremony. &quot;We will tell our people to work together to solve the problem.&quot; Thai authorities have blamed BRN, or the National Revolution Front, for organising a bloody Islamic insurgency that has been a daily fact of life in Thailand&apos;s three southernmost provinces since 2004. The violence has ranged from beheadings and roadside bombings to teacher shootings in Buddhist schools, with most of the victims being civilian Buddhist Thais and Muslim Malays. It is believed security forces and teachers are singled out as they represent the Thai Buddhist government but the daily violence has prompted some locals to turn against the insurgents. In one of the most recent clashes Thai marines killed 16 insurgents who were attacking a military base in Narathiwat province. It was the deadliest toll the insurgency had seen since more than 100 died in a single day in April 2004. The base had been tipped off by local people that the insurgents were planning an attack. Thailand&apos;s deep south was an independent Islamic sultanate until it was annexed by Buddhist-majority Thailand in the early 20th century. Muslims living there have long complained of discrimination by the central government in Bangkok. Substantial anger towards the government flared up in October 2004 when the Thai army arrested scores of Muslim men, tied them up and piled them on top of each other in trucks, where 78 of them suffocated. The insurgency has no clear leader and no clear goals, and for the past decade has remained a murky, decentralised uprising with various factions. Both the BRN and another militant group, the Pattani United Liberation Organisation, have called for a separate state. It is unclear whether the other groups will follow the BRN&apos;s lead in Thursday&apos;s agreement, particularly as doubts persist over the desires of the &quot;old guard&quot; separatists versus their younger revolutionary counterparts. Malaysia \u2013 which has been brokering a peace deal between the Philippines government and the rebel Moro National Liberation Front \u2013 is currently acting as a facilitator in the potential Thai deal as its northern states border Thailand&apos;s south.

The law enforcement fightback must mirror the war against illegal drugs, said John Scanlon, secretary general of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), with undercover operations and harsh penalties. The warning comes as officials from 177 countries gather in Bangkok for the first Cites summit for three years, with major battles expected over protection for polar bears, ending &quot;trophy&quot; hunting for rhinos and the free trade in ivory in the host nation, Thailand. The vast trade in shark fins and turtles will also come under attack, as will the large-scale felling of tropical rosewood and sandalwood, as well as less well-known issues such as Indonesia&apos;s huge exports of frogs&apos; legs, and the trade in cheetahs and python skins. &quot;Illegal trade in wildlife has now reached a scale that poses an immediate risk to wildlife and to people,&quot; Scanlon wrote in the Guardian. &quot;It increasingly involves\u00a0organised crime\u00a0syndicates, and in some cases rebel militia. This poses a serious threat to the\u00a0stability and economy of affected countries and robs them of their natural resources. They must be stopped. &quot;The UN security council recently linked the Lord&apos;s Resistance Army to ivory smuggling in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, while al-Qaida&apos;s al-Shabaab group has been linked to illegal ivory in Somalia. Wildlife officers serving in the frontline are being outgunned and they need support from police, and sometimes the military, as well as the international community,&quot; said Scanlon, who will meet officials from Interpol and the UN office on drugs and crime. &quot;It is time to treat this as serious crime and to deploy the techniques used to combat illicit trade in narcotics, such as undercover operations. Bringing this destructive activity to an end will also require harsh penalties.&quot; The global black market in animal and plants, sold as food, traditional medicines and exotic pets, is worth billions and sees an estimated 350 million specimens traded every year. But while the profits are high, the penalties are often only fines. Drug smugglers often risk the death sentence. &quot;It is right up there with drug trafficking, illegal arms sales and people-trafficking,&quot; said the UK&apos;s wildlife minister, Richard Benyon. &quot;It is an appalling crime on a massive scale and it is a crime that affects people as well as animals. The parts traded [such as rhino horn] have a value greater than gold or heroin \u2013 it is an appalling incentive. &quot;Military-style action can kill it off but the real goal has to be to kill the demand,&quot; he said. &quot;That needs co-operation at the highest level and the UK is working hard towards that.&quot; China is the main market for elephant ivory ornaments and Vietnam, where the native rhino has been driven to extinction, is where most rhino horn is sold as medicine. Thailand will face calls for trade sanctions unless it outlaws its trade in domestic ivory, which is used by criminals to launder African ivory. &quot;This is an opportunity for Thailand to show what it is doing to drive out illegal trade,&quot; said Benyon. &quot;As few as 2,500 wild elephants are left in Thailand,&quot; said Janpai Ongsiriwittaya, of WWF-Thailand. &quot;That&apos;s as many elephants as were wiped out each month in Africa in 2012 to fuel demand for ivory trinkets. If Thailand fails to take bold action, its elephants could be next.&quot; Thailand is also seen as a hub for other illegal wildlife, with recent captures at Bangkok airport including live leopard cubs, pythons, gibbons, bear cubs and parrots in luggage. The UK leads the Cites working party on rhinos and will seek to force a ban on the export of &quot;trophy&quot; white rhinos shot in South Africa, where poaching has soared in the past year. The UK also backs a ban on the international trade in polar bears, hundreds of which are shot each year for export. The UK has legally imported more than 500 polar bear parts in the past decade. But the Canadian government will fight the proposal hard, claiming that the bears are not threatened with extinction. However, the species most affected by criminal plundering of millions of animals a year are not the largest animals, said Vincent Nijman, a wildlife trade expert at Oxford Brookes University. &quot;We often think about tigers or elephants, but the high volume is in species like frogs, snakes, turtles, lizards and sea horses. We have seen a huge increase in Asia in the exotic meat trade.&quot; The world&apos;s fast-rising human population and growing prosperity in countries such as China mean demand for exotic creatures, such as pangolins, has left &quot;ghost forests&quot; in places where all the wildlife has been stripped out. This also happens in the oceans, said Nijman, pointing to the dramatic fall in the tonnes of soft-shell turtles flown out of Sumatra every week to China in the early 2000s. &quot;That&apos;s not because the demand has fallen: basically the animals have gone,&quot; he said. The Cites convention is now 40 years old and has largely been successful, according to Nijman. &quot;It is by no means perfect, but it is much better than all the other conservation or environment-related conventions.&quot; But Will Travers, chief executive of the Born Free Foundation, said the meeting in Bangkok must be ambitious. &quot;The situation is now so bad that without a dramatic step-change in our efforts, we shall, in my view, end up with a handful of &apos;wildlife fortresses&apos; \u2013 heavily guarded national reserves and parks, protected by garrisons of armed rangers and wardens \u2013 and that&apos;s it.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-03-01T17:29:27Z", "tags": ["Wildlife", "Environment", "Endangered habitats", "Conservation", "Endangered species", "Animals", "World news", "Illegal wildlife trade"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/01/people-animals-wildlife-crime", "title": "People and animals at immediate risk from wildlife crime, Cites chief warns", "sentences": ["The warning comes as officials from 177 countries gather in Bangkok for the first Cites summit for three years, with major battles expected over protection for polar bears, ending &quot;trophy&quot; hunting for rhinos and the free trade in ivory in the host nation, Thailand.", "If Thailand fails to take bold action, its elephants could be next.&quot; Thailand is also seen as a hub for other illegal wildlife, with recent captures at Bangkok airport including live leopard cubs, pythons, gibbons, bear cubs and parrots in luggage.", "&quot;It is by no means perfect, but it is much better than all the other conservation or environment-related conventions.&quot; But Will Travers, chief executive of the Born Free Foundation, said the meeting in Bangkok must be ambitious."]}, {"article": "Illegal trade in wildlife has now reached a scale that poses an immediate risk to wildlife and to people. Over the past five years, we have seen a dramatic spike in the poaching and illegal trade in elephants and rhinos. In 2011 an estimated 25,000 elephants were poached across Africa and in South Africa alone 668 rhinos were lost to poachers in 2012. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) was born 40 years ago on 3 March, 1973 in Washington DC. It sets the global controls for trade in wildlife, and the 177 countries that have joined CITES will meet from Monday in Bangkok, Thailand to take stock of of the situation, step up enforcement efforts and send clear political signals on putting a stop to illegal wildlife trade.\u00a0\u00a0 Today&apos;s wildlife crime increasing involves\u00a0organised crime\u00a0syndicates, and in some cases rebel militia. These criminals operate across national borders and through international shipment routes; have significant financial support; understand and utilise new technologies, and are often well-armed. They do not hesitate to use violence or threats of violence against those who try to stand in their way, and constantly adapt their tactics to avoid detection and prosecution. In doing so, they exploit people in some of the poorest countries of the world, corrupt officials and kill and injure wildlife officers. This poses a serious threat to the\u00a0stability and economy of these countries, robs them of their natural resources and cultural heritage, and undermines good governance and the rule of law. These criminals are laundering their ill-gotten gains and in some instances, use them to finance armed conflicts and other criminal activities, with the UN Security Council recently linking the Lord&apos;s Resistance Army to the illicit trade in ivory in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They must be stopped.\u00a0 Wildlife crime can be attractive to criminal gangs due to the lower risk of detection and prosecution, and it often carries relatively low penalties. Wildlife officers serving in the frontline are being outgunned and they need support from police, and sometimes the military, as well as the international community. It is time to treat wildlife crime as serious crime and to deploy the techniques used to combat illicit trade in narcotics, such as undercover operations and &quot;controlled deliveries&quot; \u2013 meaning contraband is not seized but tracked to its destination. This will enable the masterminds in this illegal trade to be identified, prosecuted and convicted. Bringing this destructive activity to an end will require harsh penalties, including making sure these criminals do not profit from their crimes. These enforcement measures need to be coupled with well-targeted public awareness campaigns to help suppress demand for illegal goods. While the challenges we face today are real and serious they should not overshadow our conservation successes through ensuring legal, sustainable and traceable trade in some species - such as with the African cherry, the Latin American vicuna, crocodiles and the Queen conch, where their survival in the wild was assured when their bark, wool, skins and meat, respectively, became legally and sustainably managed, with tangible benefits for local communities. The recovery of the African elephant and the rhino over recent decades - and in particular the white rhino, has also been a great conservation success. White rhino population numbers in Africa have risen from about 2,000 in 1973 to over 19,000 in 2012, with South Africa having conserved more than 90% of this total. But these successes are now under grave threat, which serves to demonstrate that we cannot take anything for granted. With a combination of conservation measures, strong enforcement, public awareness and adequate resources we can reverse the current alarming trends. This is why CITES is working with Interpol, the UN Office of Drugs and Crime, the World Bank and the World Customs Organisation to support source, transit and destination countries in combatting this serious crime. We know the way, now we need the collective will. The CITES World Wildlife Conference opening next week in Bangkok is when we must come together to turn the tables on wildlife crime.

Ahead of the meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), which begins on Sunday in Bangkok, the authors of the study, published in the journal Marine Policy, warn that the rate of fishing for sharks, most of which grow slowly and reproduce late in life, is exceeding their ability to recover. &quot;Sharks simply can&apos;t keep up with the current rate of exploitation and demand,&quot; said Boris Worm, a marine biologist at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada. &quot;Protective measures must be scaled up significantly in order to avoid further depletion and the possible extinction of many species of shark in our lifetime,&quot; he said. Sharks are caught for their meat, liver oil, cartilage \u2013 and especially their fins. Shark finning has been banned by several countries but researchers have found no decline in the numbers of dead sharks, many of which are dumped at sea after their fins have been hacked off. &quot;Their numbers are crashing,&quot; said Elizabeth Wilson of the Pew Global Shark Conservation campaign. &quot;We are now the predators.&quot; Conservation charities including WWF are lobbying hard for this Cites meeting, the first since 2010, to take decisive action on the illicit wildlife trade, with rhino and elephant also under threat. The UK Border Force&apos;s specialist Cites team finds illegal items &quot;every day&quot;. Recent seizures include a box of ivory bracelets, a stuffed snow leopard and four rhino horns worth more than \u00a31m. Officer Tim Luffman says shark fin and medicines made from tiger are common finds. Ivory, worth around \u00a31,000 a kilo, has been outpriced by rhino horn at \u00a340,000 to \u00a360,000 a kilo on the black market. Border Force officials are also finding rare orchids, endangered live fish, coral and birds of prey. Luffman said: &quot;Logically if you have a heavy weight of ivory you&apos;ll put it on a shipping container but every plane that lands here at Heathrow carries freight and as soon as the wheels of a plane touch down on our soil, or a vessel enters our waters, then the cargo is in our country and it&apos;s our responsibility. &quot;It&apos;s not the case, as it once was, of rogue traders so much as organised crime, although of course we still get the tourists and holidaymakers trying to bring in souvenirs they&apos;ve bought that they shouldn&apos;t have.&quot; The team now has specially trained wildlife sniffer dogs who regularly patrol the baggage areas and can pick out ivory and other illicit items just by smell. Heather Sohl, a chief adviser on species at WWF, said the UK was leading the world in taking wildlife crime seriously. &quot;At Cites we will be calling for all countries to be held accountable and for sanctions to be brought to bear if they are not,&quot; she said. International wildlife trade is diverse. At the moment rhino horn, already popular in traditional Asian medicine, has become hugely trendy in Vietnam in &quot;health&quot; drinks, after a rumour took hold that a government minister was cured of cancer after drinking it. Some 668 rhinos were slaughtered in South Africa in 2012 \u2013 up from just 13 in 2007. The trafficking of rhino horn to Asia, where it is prized in traditional medicine, &quot;continues to be one of the most structured criminal activities currently faced by Cites&quot;, experts say. WWF has launched a petition to ban all trade in ivory in Thailand, collecting half a million signatures that were presented to prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra this week. The charity is also calling for sanctions against Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Thailand, which it says have flouted the law for years. Delegates to the Cites meeting are expected to strengthen protection for multiple plant species, including Madagascan ebony and rosewood. Proposals to protect sharks, which failed in 2010 in the face of opposition from Asian countries, will be considered before the meeting ends on 14 March and may bring in limited export permits.", "publicationDate": "2013-03-02T16:58:08Z", "tags": ["Fishing", "Illegal wildlife trade", "WWF"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/02/shark-killings-humans-become-predators", "title": "Shark killings exceed 100m every year as humans become the predators", "sentences": ["Ahead of the meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), which begins on Sunday in Bangkok, the authors of the study, published in the journal Marine Policy, warn that the rate of fishing for sharks, most of which grow slowly and reproduce late in life, is exceeding their ability to recover."]}, {"article": "When Brandon Stanton found out last week that DKNY had used his photographs in a Bangkok storefront without his permission, he was understandably upset. &quot;I had a very strong emotional reaction,&quot; the 29-year-old New York City street photographer told the Guardian. &quot;I felt disrespected and stepped on&quot;. Stanton, who runs Humans Of New York, a popular photo blog with over 500,000 followers on social media, decided not to pursue compensation through legal action for &quot;personal reasons&quot;, even though his photography is his sole source of income. Rather, he took to social media to ask DKNY to donate $100,000 to his local YMCA instead. &quot;I&apos;ve been going almost every day to the YMCA to work out for two and a half years,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ve gotten to know the staff and the kids that hang out there, and I see how important the YMCA is to their lives.&quot; Five hours and nearly 30,000 &quot;shares&quot; of his Facebook post later, DKNY issued an apology \u2013 appropriately, via its various social-media outlets. It also pledged to donate $25,000 to the YMCA in Stanton&apos;s name. The photographer was pleased with the donation. &quot;I thought, $25,000 would help a lot of kids,&quot; he said. &quot;But the next day I woke up and thought, &apos;Well, why not try and raise the rest of the $75,000? That way, we can help a lot more kids at the YMCA and help them go to summer camp.&quot; Stanton set up a fundraising campaign on Wednesday, via the crowdfunding website Indiegogo, and urged his online community to support his cause. The photographer set Friday 1 March as the deadline and $75,000 as the target sum. Within two days, his fundraiser had surpassed that goal and the donations were still pouring in. The fundraiser closed on Friday night with 3,145 backers pledging a total of $103,710. &quot;Today is my birthday, and I couldn&apos;t imagine a better gift than passing $100,000 and helping those kids,&quot; Stanton said. Stanton had engaged his Humans of New York community before, when he launched a crowdfunding campaign for Hurricane Sandy relief. He offered donors signed photographs in return for donations, something he felt he couldn&apos;t do this time around, due to his current financial circumstances. &quot;I was unsure how the community would react this time without me offering signed photographs or anything,&quot; he said. &quot;This is a strong testament to my fans&apos; generosity, to how much a community managed to raise compared to a giant company.&quot; In the statement posted on Stanton&apos;s facebook page, DKNY said the Bangkok store had inadvertently used an internal mockup containing Stanton&apos;s images, after the photographer had turned down DKNY&apos;s offer to buy 300 of his photographs. &quot;They wanted me to track down all 300 of my models and have them sign model releases, which would have been monstrous work,&quot; he said. &quot;It wouldn&apos;t have been worth $50 per photo.&quot; &quot;I&apos;ve had over a hundred lawyers send me messages telling me what my rights are, how I should sue DKNY,&quot; he said. &quot;But I spend a lot of time on the street taking photographs.

Thailand is the key place where illegal ivory from Africa is laundered into products destined for the world&apos;s biggest market in China. Yingluck Shinawatra&apos;s announcement on Sunday came on the opening day of the world&apos;s biggest wildlife summit in Bangkok. The two-week meeting of the 178 nations that form the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) faces bitter battles over improved protection for polar bears and ending &quot;trophy&quot; hunting for rhinos. It aims to tackle the trade in shark fins, in which 100m sharks are killed each year. &quot;Elephants are very important for Thai culture,&quot; said Shinawatra, who made the statement after she received a petition from 1.5 million people around the world. &quot;Unfortunately, many have used Thailand as a transit country for the illegal international ivory trade. &quot;We will work towards amending the national legislation with the goal of putting an end to ivory trade. This will help protect all forms of elephants including Thailand&apos;s wild and domestic elephants and those from Africa.&quot; Selling trinkets produced from ivory from Thailand&apos;s 2,500 remaining elephants is legal. There are 67 authorised ivory vendors, but market surveys have found ivory in more than 250 shops, where African ivory is passed off as Thai. There were 1.3m African elephants in 1979, but poaching has reduced the population to as few as 400,000. Officially there is a total ban on international trade in ivory, but there is a rampant black market, fuelled in places by organised crime and terrorist groups including the Lord&apos;s Resistance Army in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and al-Qaida&apos;s al-Shabaab in Somalia. &quot;We&apos;re thrilled that Prime Minister Shinawatra has pledged to end ivory trade in her country. But she now needs to ensure that it takes place as a matter of urgency, because the slaughter of elephants continues,&quot; said Carlos Drews, the head of WWF&apos;s delegation to Cites. Philip Mansbridge, the CEO of Care for the Wild, was more cautious in his welcome. &quot;We were disappointed by the lack of a clear commitment to banning the domestic trade. We don&apos;t feel it has gone far enough.&quot; He added: &quot;Poaching isn&apos;t just a problem for Kenya, South Africa or wherever the animals are. It&apos;s a problem for the rest of the world because the scale of poaching means that it has become a national security issue.&quot; Thailand, along with Nigeria and Congo, may face trade sanctions if Cites member nations do not feel they are doing enough to tackle the illegal ivory trade.", "publicationDate": "2013-03-03T16:03:15Z", "tags": ["Illegal wildlife trade", "Conservation", "Animals", "Environment", "Wildlife", "Endangered species", "Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Africa"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/03/thailand-outlaw-ivory-trade", "title": "Thailand's prime minister pledges to outlaw domestic ivory trade", "sentences": ["Yingluck Shinawatra&apos;s announcement on Sunday came on the opening day of the world&apos;s biggest wildlife summit in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "A Libyan politician who is suing the former foreign secretary Jack Straw and the British government for damages after being kidnapped and taken to one of Gaddafi&apos;s jails has offered to settle the case for just \u00a33, providing he also receives an unreserved apology. In a challenge to British government claims that a new generation of secret courts is needed to prevent large payouts to claimants in national security cases, Abdel Hakim Belhaj says he will settle the action \u2013 through which one other dissident received a \u00a32.2m pay-out \u2013 for a pound each from the government, Straw, and Sir Mark Allen, former head of counter-terrorism at MI6. Belhaj was leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, opposing the Libyan dictator, when he and his wife were detained by American intelligence officers at Bangkok airport in March 2004. Allegedly he was tortured for several days while his wife, who was five months&apos; pregnant, was chained to a wall at a secret prison at the airport. The couple were then flown to Tripoli, where Belhaj spent the next six years in jail. Now leader of the Libyan Al-Watan party, Belhaj launched proceedings after a number of previously secret documents, discovered in a Tripoli office building during the 2011 revolution, showed that Allen had written to Musa Kusa, Gaddafi&apos;s intelligence chief at the time, to claim credit for providing the tip-off that led to the couple&apos;s detention. Belhaj says he was repeatedly tortured in Gaddafi&apos;s prisons, and that he was interrogated by UK intelligence officers who knew how he was being treated. His wife, Fatima Bouchar, who had been taped to a stretcher for the 17-hour flight to Tripoli, was detained for four months, being released shortly before giving birth. Belhaj wrote to David Cameron last week to say that he would settle for just a pound from each defendant, providing each of them unreservedly apologised to his wife and himself. In his letter, Belhaj says he will &quot;forever be grateful to Britain&quot; for helping the Libyan people topple Gaddafi, and that he is anxious to see good relations between the two countries. He writes: &quot;For this reason, I am making an open offer to settle our litigation. My wife and I are willing to end our case against the UK government and Messrs Straw and Allen in exchange for a token compensation of a British pound from each defendant, an apology and an admission of liability for what was done to us.&quot; He added that he wanted to lay to rest all claims that he and his wife were bringing the claim to enrich themselves. &quot;My wife and I suffered deeply during our kidnap and in Libya, and \u2026 continue to suffer. My wife may never be the same again. But we have come to court in Britain because we believe your courts can deliver justice. We are primarily bringing this claim to secure a public judgment, recognising the wrongs we have suffered.&quot; His lawyers at Leigh Day and Co, along with Reprieve, the legal charity, say the offer contradicts UK government claims that the controversial secret courts provisions of the justice and security bill, upon which MPs are due to vote on Monday, are needed partly to save the government from making substantial payments to individuals alleging UK complicity in their abduction and torture. Ken Clarke, the minister responsible steering the bill through parliament, has said the payments are being made not because the claims have merit but because the government needs to protect secret intelligence material. Clarke has also claimed that this could lead to taxpayers&apos; money being used to fund terrorism, a claim that was dismissed at the weekend as &quot;thoroughly misleading&quot; by the former director of public prosecutions Ken Macdonald. Macdonald said: &quot;The sad truth is Clarke&apos;s comments look like a smokescreen for plans which are aimed not at keeping the British people safe but at sparing the embarrassment of the security services when they get mixed up in wrongdoing.&quot; The bill is also opposed by civil rights and journalists&apos; groups, and hundreds of leading lawyers, who have denounced its provisions as &quot;dangerous and unnecessary&quot; and say it is intended not to protect secret intelligence but to cover up evidence of the British government&apos;s involvement in serious crimes after 9/11. Belhaj says he has no wish to see his case enter the secret court system, which the justice and security bill seeks to introduce. &quot;I have been a victim of a secret trial before, in Gaddafi&apos;s Libya. I did not get to see any evidence or to question any witnesses against me. For all I know there were no witnesses. I was then sentenced to death.&quot; With Scotland Yard inquiring into two UK-Libyan rendition operations, however, it remains to be seen whether any of the defendants in the Belhaj civil claim will admit liability. Sami al-Saadi, another Libyan dissident, has accepted \u00a32.2m from the British government after he and his wife and four children, the youngest a girl aged six, were abducted in Hong Kong and flown to Tripoli, three days after Tony Blair made his first visit to Libya, embraced Gaddafi for the cameras and announced that they planned to make &quot;common cause&quot; in counter-terrorism operations. Among the documents discovered in Tripoli was a fax the CIA sent to the Gaddafi government offering to assist Libya and the UK with the &quot;rendition&quot; of the family. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: &quot;We can confirm we have received a letter from Mr Belhaj. [The government] is co-operating fully with investigations into allegations made by former Libyan detainees about UK involvement in their mistreatment by the [Gaddafi] regime. A police investigation is underway so we are unable to comment further.

Yingluck Shinawatra&apos;s announcement at the opening of wildlife trade meeting Cites in Bangkok comes as African elephants are again on a dramatic trajectory towards extinction. Many conservationists believe that this time the crisis can only be halted by addressing the demand for ivory in Asian countries, especially China which accounts for more than 50% of the world&apos;s consumption of ivory. Ivory was once only affordable to the very rich, and it conferred great prestige to its owner. Now, the possibility of owning ivory is real for hundreds of millions of newly rich Chinese people. This lust for elephants&apos; teeth in China has driven up the price to more than $1,000 per kilogram, up from $150/kg just six years ago. So much money can be made that it has turned elephant ranges into devastating killing fields across Africa. It&apos;s not just the consumers back home in the motherland \u2013 the presence of hundreds of thousands of Chinese expatriates in Africa has created opportunities to short circuit some of the traditional middle men. Now Chinese nationals can place orders directly from poachers themselves. In 2011 more than 150 Chinese citizens were arrested across Africa and according to the Kenya Wildlife Service, 90% of ivory seized at Kenya&apos;s airports involves Chinese citizens. China is reeling under the implications of its role in this deadly trade, especially after persuading the Cites authority in 2007 that the country had adequate controls in place to manage legal ivory trade. That is when China won status as a trading partner for ivory which allowed it to import 67 tonnes of ivory from southern African countries. That trust was badly misplaced and it sent such a confusing message to Chinese consumers that it triggered a massive renewed interest in ivory. In response to the findings of independent research which show that more than half of the ivory on the streets of China is illegal, the Chinese government has made impressive efforts to clean things up. A crackdown on wildlife crime dubbed Cobra was initiated and has resulted in hundreds of arrests and seizures of wildlife specimens, including 6.5 tonnes of elephant ivory. The illegal online trade in wildlife on websites like Alibaba, Taobao, and Tencent was shut down in June 2012. But it&apos;s too little and it&apos;s too late. The damage has been done, a message has been sent that ivory is legal and the average Chinese person would like to own a piece. Most Chinese ivory consumers say that they believe ivory is produced in a sustainable way, but in a National Geographic special titled Battle for the Elephants, researcher Bryan Christy shows that perhaps the problem is not awareness, but lack of compassion. The Chinese appear not to care about the slaughter that is going on in Africa as a result of their consumption of ivory. The conservation community has responded with massive education and awareness campaigns that target young people in an attempt to reduce the demand. Organisations like Wild Aid and WWF are conducting appeals to consumers via celebrities like basketball star Yao Ming. Changing cultures through appeals could take years, and in the meantime tens of thousands of elephants will die. China has responded in a predictable way to accusations that it is responsible for the ongoing the killing of elephants, accusing African countries of failing to implement good policies and for weak enforcement. But even extreme efforts to hold back poachers are not working. Kenya has invested millions in saving elephants, and more than 40 poachers have been killed. The amount of money at stake is so huge that it is driving impunity and corruption and poaching is now being conducted by armed cartels. The government of Kenya has declared the situation a national crisis and has agreed to apply anti corruption and organised crime legislation to combat the problem. Solving the crisis requires much more than Cites. To those who have studied the crisis, the solution is simple, it lies with the messages that China releases. As a world superpower, key influencer in the far east, and a major economic partner for Africa, China has what it takes to make the difference for elephants and halt the extinction of the world&apos;s largest land mammal. African governments have realised this and are now appealing to China to act as a leader. In a speech at the United Nations, Patrick Omondi, representing the Kenyan government said:  &quot;People in China do not need ivory. They can live without it. We need our elephants. We appeal to the Chinese government to ban the legal domestic ivory trade and shut down all ivory markets&quot;.  This Kenya believes, would send the crystal clear message to consumers around the world.

A trade in their gills worth just $5-10m a year is devastating their populations which, in the places where it is developed, supports a tourist trade worth well over $100m a year.  It is not hard to see why tourists will pay to see them. They are extraordinary creatures, up to 7m in wingspan, living for 50 years and unafraid of people. But their curiosity makes them very easy to catch and in Indonesia and Sri Lanka, populations have plummeted by 56% to 86%, according to a report by Wild Aid and Shark Savers.  The rays are killed for their sets of gill-rakers, the frilly plates that filter their food from the ocean. The local fishermen might receive as little as $40 for one ray, but by the time the dried gills have reached their market in China, the price will have risen by as much as 50 times. But even that inflated price is far below the value of a live manta ray, which the report estimates at $1m over its lifetime.  The gills are purported to clean impurities, although Guy Stevens, a scientist at the Manta Ray of Hope campaign told me: &quot;There is no evidence that the gills were ever a traditional Chinese medicine.&quot; At least 3,500 manta ray kills are recorded each year, according the wildlife trade group Traffic, but the real total is likely to be nearer 5,000. The key problem is that manta rays reproduce very slowly, meaning the killing places their survival on the line. It takes 8-10 years for a female to become sexually mature and then only one pup is born every 2-5 years. Stevens, who is based in the Maldives, told me: &quot;We have 5,000 manta rays, the biggest population in the world, but we have not had a single female give birth in the last three years, probably due to a weakening of the monsoon.&quot; The summit of the Convention on the Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), being held in Bangkok, will vote on whether to place manta rays on a list of species for which international trade is regulated. At present, the manta ray haul is completely unmanaged. &quot;That would be just the first hurdle,&quot; said Stevens. &quot;Right now the trade is completely unsustainable.&quot;  Businessman Sir Richard Branson is supporting the campaign for greater protection. &quot;While the gills are valuable, the trade is also robbing local economies and the environment of one of the most charismatic creatures in the ocean that could draw millions of dollars each year for those communities.&quot; Stevens has seen how crucial protecting manta rays and other sea life has been to the Maldivian tourist trade. He hopes the same can happen in places like Sri Lanka, which is emerging from the aftermath of a civil war. The key, he says, is that tourism is sustainable year after year.  The manta ray story is the story of Cites in microcosm: a choice between a destructive export trade that eats its own lunch by driving species to extinction or a sustainable, domestic trade that can survive indefinitely, not just preserving the glories of the natural world but also providing livelihoods for people all over the world.", "publicationDate": "2013-03-05T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Environment", "Illegal wildlife trade", "Wildlife", "Oceans", "Fishing"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/mar/05/manta-rays-cites-illegal-wildlife-trade", "title": "Manta rays: how illegal trade eats its own lunch | Damian Carrington", "sentences": ["Stevens, who is based in the Maldives, told me: &quot;We have 5,000 manta rays, the biggest population in the world, but we have not had a single female give birth in the last three years, probably due to a weakening of the monsoon.&quot; The summit of the Convention on the Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), being held in Bangkok, will vote on whether to place manta rays on a list of species for which international trade is regulated."]}, {"article": "The forest elephants of Africa have lost almost two-thirds of their number in the past decade due to poaching for ivory, a landmark new study revealed on Tuesday. The research was released at an international wildlife summit in Bangkok where the eight key ivory-trading nations, including the host nation Thailand and biggest market China, have been put on notice of sweeping trade sanctions if they fail to crack down on the trade. &quot;The analysis confirms what conservationists have feared: the rapid trend towards extinction \u2013 potentially within the next decade \u2013 of the forest elephant,&quot; said Samantha Strindberg of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), one of 60 scientists on the research team. There are about 100,000 forest elephants remaining in the forests of central Africa, compared with about 400,000 of the slightly larger savannah elephants. The total elephant population was over 1 million 30 years ago, but has been devastated by poaching driven by the rising demand for ivory ornaments in Asia. Prof Lee White, head of the National Parks Service in Gabon, once home to the largest forest elephant population, said: &quot;A rainforest without elephants is a barren place. They bring it to life, they create the trails and keep open the forest clearings other animals use; they disperse the seeds of many of the rainforest trees \u2013 elephants are forest gardeners at a vast scale.&quot; Forest elephants have suffered particularly badly because they range across central Africa, which has been left lawless in large areas by war, and where poachers have ready access to guns. Furthermore, the tusks of forest elephants are longer, straighter and harder than savannah elephants, making them particularly sought after. &quot;A lot of carvers prefer forest elephant tusks,&quot; said WCS&apos;s vice president, Elizabeth Bennett. Although deforestation is taking place, loss of habitat is not the principal problem for the elephants, according to another of the scientific team, John Hart of the Lukuru Foundation. &quot;Historically, elephants ranged right across the forests of this vast region of over 2m sq km, but they now cower in just a quarter of that area. Although the forest cover remains, it is empty of elephants, demonstrating that this is not a habitat degradation issue. This is almost entirely due to poaching.&quot; The new study, published in the journal Plos One, took nine years to complete and the team spent over 90,000 person-days in the field, walking over 13,000 km and taking 11,000 samples. They found the population fell by 62% between 2002 and 2011 and was now less than 10% of its potential size. Last month, Gabon announced the death of about 11,000 forest elephants in the Mink\u00e9b\u00e9 national park between 2004 and 2012. Gabon&apos;s president, Ali Bongo Ondimba, says: &quot;Our elephants are under siege because of an illegal international market that has driven ivory prices in the region up significantly. I call upon the international community to join us in this fight. If we do not reverse the tide fast the African elephant will be exterminated.&quot; The 178-nation summit of the Convention on the Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) began in Bangkok on Monday and has already seen the eight countries identified as key to the ivory trade threatened with trade sanctions if they do not tackle failures in protection against poaching in Africa and failures in seizing illegal ivory along trade routes to China. The nations, including the states which most ivory passes through \u2013 Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Malaysia, Philippines and Vietnam \u2013 and where most ivory is bought \u2013 China and Thailand - must come up with concrete action plans or face a ban on millions of dollars of trade in animals and plants, including crocodile skins and orchids. The Thai prime minister opened the Cites summit by pledging to outlaw Thailand&apos;s domestic ivory trade which is currently legal. But she was criticised for failing to set a deadline. Proposals to the Cites summit supporting and opposing more &quot;one-off&quot; sales of ivory will not succeed, the Guardian has been told. A previous &quot;one-off&quot; sale in 2008 was criticised by some as driving up demand, but defended by others as providing funds for elephant protection. Cutting the demand for ivory, as well as fighting poaching, is seen as crucial, with African elephant deaths running at 25,000 a year. Bennett said better education programmes in China would be a vital part of the action plans: &quot;A lot of people don&apos;t actually know that you have to kill elephants to get ivory.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-03-05T11:23:02Z", "tags": ["Illegal wildlife trade", "Wildlife", "Conservation", "Animals", "Environment", "Endangered species", "Africa", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/05/two-thirds-forest-elephants-killed", "title": "Two-thirds of forest elephants killed by ivory poachers in past decade", "sentences": ["The research was released at an international wildlife summit in Bangkok where the eight key ivory-trading nations, including the host nation Thailand and biggest market China, have been put on notice of sweeping trade sanctions if they fail to crack down on the trade.", "If we do not reverse the tide fast the African elephant will be exterminated.&quot; The 178-nation summit of the Convention on the Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) began in Bangkok on Monday and has already seen the eight countries identified as key to the ivory trade threatened with trade sanctions if they do not tackle failures in protection against poaching in Africa and failures in seizing illegal ivory along trade routes to China."]}, {"article": "Chelsea have denied reports that they are in discussions with Frank Lampard over extending his contract past this summer. The club&apos;s chief executive, Ron Gourlay, had been quoted as saying that contract negotiations were &quot;ongoing&quot;, raising hopes that the veteran England midfielder might prolong his career at Stamford Bridge. Lampard, 34, is out of contract at the end of June, with the reigning European champions having initially decreed that the summer would be a suitable time for his 12-year spell at the club to draw to a close. However, no formal offer has been made to the midfielder and on Tuesday Chelsea quickly refuted the reports, adding that any talks with their players &quot;remain confidential&quot;. A number of clubs, including Los Angeles Galaxy and teams in China, had expressed an interest in securing his services when he became a free agent. However, Lampard is reluctant to sign a pre-contract agreement elsewhere in the hope that his prolific recent form \u2013 he has scored 11 goals in his last 19 appearances for club and country \u2013 might prompt Chelsea into a rethink. Talks of some kind had been anticipated late last month, a reflection of his form and vociferous calls from the fan base to offer the vice-captain a new deal, though it remains to be seen what offer, if any, the Premier League club deliver. &quot;Obviously conversations must remain confidential between the club and the players at all times so that is as much as I can say,&quot; confirmed Gourlay at a press conference at the Renaissance Hotel in Bangkok, where the chief executive was formally announcing the details of Chelsea&apos;s pre-season tour for the summer. That at least suggested there remains a chance Lampard could prolong his stay at Stamford Bridge. The player currently boasts 199 goals for the London club, three shy of the club record currently held by Bobby Tambling, and remains a key member of the current squad. Gourlay reiterated there were no plans afoot to remove the interim first-team manager, Rafael Ben\u00edtez, as the team seek to recover their place in the Premier League&apos;s top three. Chelsea are currently fourth, two points behind Tottenham Hotspur but five clear of Arsenal following Saturday&apos;s much needed victory over West Bromwich Albion. &quot;It was the club&apos;s plan to have Ben\u00edtez as interim manager with the aim of securing a Champions League position at the end of the Premier League season,&quot; said Gourlay. &quot;We&apos;ll assess the situation then. We can still win the Europa League and the FA Cup, but make no mistake, our priority lies with a Champions League spot.&quot; Ben\u00edtez will take his side to Romania for a Europa League last-16 tie against Steaua Bucharest on Thursday before a trip to Old Trafford for Sunday&apos;s FA Cup quarter-final against Manchester United. The Spaniard has already confirmed he will have left the club by the time Chelsea depart for Thailand on 11 July for pre-season, where they will play a Singha Selection XI at Rajamangala Stadium six days later.

In a speech to the UN human rights council in Geneva introducing a report on the issue, Ben Emmerson, a British barrister who is the UN&apos;s special rapporteur on protecting human rights within efforts to combat terrorism, demanded that Britain publish the interim findings of a report by a retired judge, Sir Peter Gibson, into the involvement of MI5 and MI6 in the removal and mistreatment of terrorist suspects. In a response delivered at the council, British officials said the government was &quot;looking carefully at the contents of the report by the Gibson inquiry on its preparatory work, with a view to publishing as much of it as possible&quot;. There was no word on when this might happen. Emmerson also asked the US to release a similar report by the Senate&apos;s select committee on intelligence into the CIA&apos;s secret detention and interrogation programme. Failure to do so showed a seeming unwillingness by both governments to face up to serious international crimes and &quot;a policy of de facto immunity for public officials who engaged in acts of torture, rendition and secret detention, and their superiors and political masters who authorised these acts&quot;, Emmerson said. &quot;Words are not enough. Platitudinous repetition of statements affirming opposition to torture ring hollow to many in those parts of the Middle East and North Africa that have undergone, or are undergoing, major upheaval, since they have first-hand experience of living under repressive regimes that used torture in private whilst making similar statements in public,&quot; he added. &quot;The scepticism of these communities can only be reinforced if western governments continue to demonstrate resolute indifference to the crimes committed by their predecessor administrations.&quot; Britain and the US have come under increasing pressure as details emerge of the so-called secret rendition programme, in which terrorism suspects \u2013 some wrongly identified \u2013 were often snatched off the streets and flown to either secret CIA prisons or detention centres operated by other countries, for example Egypt, where many complained of torture and other mistreatment. On Monday, a Libyan politician suing the former foreign secretary, Jack Straw, and the British government for damages after being kidnapped at Bangkok airport and sent to jail in Tripoli, where he was tortured and also interrogated by UK intelligence officers, offered to settle the case for \u00a33, so long as he receives an unreserved apology. Despite government efforts to keep such acts secret, Emmerson said, more and more details had emerged, &quot;and calls for accountability are fast approaching a critical mass&quot;. He makes a series of specific recommendations in the associated report, including a call for 35 countries that had failed to respond to questions from a UN study on secret detention to do so, and that Britain and the US should release their reports. Shortly before the speech, Emmerson told the Guardian it was time for &quot;a reckoning with the past&quot;. He said: &quot;In South America it took up to 30 years before the officials responsible for crimes like these were held fully accountable. With the conspiracy organised by the Bush-era CIA it has taken a decade, but the campaign for securing the right to truth has now reached a critical point. &quot;The British and American governments are sitting on reports that reveal the extent of the involvement of former governments in these crimes. If William Hague is serious about pursuing a policy of ethical counter-terrorism, as he says he is, then the first thing the British government needs to do is to release the interim report of the Gibson Inquiry immediately.&quot; The Gibson report was announced by David Cameron in July 2010. However, rights groups and victims&apos; lawyers decided not to take part when it emerged the inquiry would have no power to compel official cooperation or evidence. In January 2012, the government said the inquiry was being scrapped owing to police investigations into alleged crimes. However, Emmerson said, there were no prosecutions pending and the government should publish an interim version of the report handed to them by Gibson in July last year. Emmerson&apos;s report into the issue goes into greater details about what has so far been uncovered about the US network of secret detention facilities for terrorism suspects and other countries&apos; complicity in the process. It says: &quot;There is now credible evidence to show that CIA &apos;black sites&apos; were located on the territory of Lithuania, Morocco, Poland, Romania and Thailand and that the officials of at least 49 other states allowed their airspace or airports to be used for rendition flights.&quot; Despite the scale of this, the report notes, just one criminal case has been brought, when an Italian court in 2009 convicted 22 CIA agents in absentia along with Italian intelligence service officials over the case of an Egyptian-Italian national kidnapped in Milan and sent to Cairo, where he was tortured.", "publicationDate": "2013-03-05T14:48:00Z", "tags": ["Torture", "US foreign policy", "World news", "Counter-terrorism policy", "Foreign policy", "Politics", "Law"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/mar/05/britain-us-secret-torture-reports", "title": "Britain and US asked to release secret torture reports", "sentences": ["On Monday, a Libyan politician suing the former foreign secretary, Jack Straw, and the British government for damages after being kidnapped at Bangkok airport and sent to jail in Tripoli, where he was tortured and also interrogated by UK intelligence officers, offered to settle the case for \u00a33, so long as he receives an unreserved apology."]}, {"article": "The &quot;gang of eight&quot; nations at the heart of an unprecedented surge in African elephant killing must be hit with heavy trade sanctions, according to the world&apos;s top illegal ivory official. The countries, including Kenya, Thailand and China, could be banned from all wildlife trade, including hugely lucrative orchid and crocodile skin exports. Tom Milliken, who runs the official global project that tracks illegal ivory, said every report his group, the Elephant Trade Information System, had made since it started in 1998 had identified the eight nations as the major players in the trade, but to no effect. &quot;There has been no discernible impact from previous Cites measures,&quot; he said at the 178-nation summit of the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) in Bangkok. &quot;Unless Cites scales up and takes this seriously, we are not going to win this thing.&quot; This Cites meeting should be the time sanctions should be used, he said. Tom de Meulenaer, a senior Cites official, said the body&apos;s ruling committee had finally lost patience over the issue, and if the eight countries did not produce hard action plans for the next 12 months, it was &quot;not unlikely&quot; that sanctions would be implemented. Milliken said: &quot;Can you imagine the effect on Thailand, Vietnam and China? The orchid and crocodile skin trades alone are massive.&quot; It was revealed on Wednesday that the slaughter of elephants for their ivory has doubled in a decade, while ivory seizures have tripled to an all-time high, according to a new report from Cites, the UN environment programme and others. There were 17 large-scale seizures \u2013 hundreds of tusks each \u2013 in 2011, the last full year for which data is available, when previously eight seizures was considered a very bad year. The report examined 60 sites in Africa, representing about 40% of the half million or so elephants remaining and recorded 17,000 deaths in 2011. &quot;That is above the capacity of the elephant population to replace itself,&quot; said Julian Blanc, who heads the monitoring of illegal killing of elephants project. The so-called gang of eight includes the source countries Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, countries through which ivory is smuggled, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines, and destination countries, Thailand and China. A particular problem is Thailand&apos;s legal domestic market in ivory, which allows illegal African ivory to be laundered. Yingluck Shinawatra, the Thai prime minister, opened the Cites conference by pledging to outlaw the domestic market at some point. But Ben Janse van Rensburg, chief of enforcement at Cites, cast doubt on the pledge on Wednesday: &quot;If there is any phasing out of their domestic market, it is likely to be a very long process.&quot; Cites is run by a standing committee of 20 nations which has demanded the gang of eight deliver action plans with concrete goals and timelines for the next 12 months. If these are not delivered or adhered to, Cites can ban its 178 member nations from importing any wildlife products from offending nations. Last week, it imposed this penalty on Guinea, for persistent violation of a ban on the export of great apes. Cites is seeking stronger powers to sanction at the Bangkok summit. It is also seeking funding to pay for anti-poaching and smuggling measures: a fund set up in August 2012 aiming to raise $100m has so far received only $640,000. The task faced by law enforcement authorities is formidable, said Milliken. The scale of seizures, for example 6.3 tonnes in Malaysia in November, showed the illegal trade was the work of major organised crime syndicates. &quot;They are operating with relative impunity and with little fear of prosecution,&quot; he said. Van Rensburg said the criminal &quot;kingpins&quot; needed to be targeted, that tougher penalties were needed and that officers need to also &quot;follow the money&quot; using money laundering laws. Milliken said the lack of a system for reporting ivory stockpiles, from which tusks were disappearing every year, meant it was very hard to track illegal activity: &quot;Did someone just mow down a herd of elephants, or did someone just open a door?&quot; He also criticised the lack of mandatory forensic testing of seized ivory to determine where it had come from. &quot;It is very disappointing to know that 40, 50, 70 tonnes of ivory can be seized, but we have no idea of where it is from.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-03-06T11:12:40Z", "tags": ["Illegal wildlife trade", "Wildlife", "Conservation", "Animals", "Environment", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/06/ivory-poaching-sanctions-cites", "title": "Stop ivory poaching or face sanctions, nations warned at Cites", "sentences": ["&quot;There has been no discernible impact from previous Cites measures,&quot; he said at the 178-nation summit of the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) in Bangkok.", "Cites is seeking stronger powers to sanction at the Bangkok summit."]}, {"article": "A smuggled chimp hidden between two sacks of marijuana sounds like the first line of a joke. But this monkey business, uncovered in Cameroon, is in fact only the most lurid detail from a distinctly unfunny report from the UN Environment Programme that estimates 3,000 great apes a year are illegally captured each year in forests, often to be sold as pets or tourist attractions. Moreover, the chimp-dope contraband graphically illustrates a recurring theme at the summit of the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species here in Bangkok: that major organised crimes syndicates control big parts of the illegal trade. And why wouldn&apos;t they? The profits are just as high as for smuggling drugs and guns, but the chances of getting convicted are far lower and, even if they are, the penalties are often mere fines. The UNEP report, produced by its Great Apes Survival Partnership (Grasp), estimates that a minimum of 22,218 great apes have been lost from the wild since 2005 \u2013 either sold, killed during the hunt, or dying in captivity. In the same time, only 27 arrests were made in Africa and Asia in connection with the great apes trade. A quarter were never even prosecuted. The profits margins are high, the report found. Chimps and orangutans, the most common live-traded apes, sell for hundreds or thousands of dollars. Gorillas can fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars. But a minimal amount of this goes to poor local communities. &quot;The illegal trade in\u00a0apes\u00a0has little to do with poverty,&quot; said Ofir Drori, founder of the Last Great Ape Organization in Cameroon. &quot;It is instead generated by the rich and powerful.&quot; It also has a damaging knock-on effect on the forests, which often provide food and wood for local people. &quot;Great\u00a0apes\u00a0are extremely important for the health of forests in Africa and Asia, and even the loss of 10 or 20 at a time can have a deep impact on biodiversity,&quot; said Doug Cress, coordinator of Grasp.  The apes traded alive \u2013 as opposed to those killed for bushmeat \u2013 face cruel futures, as attractions in seedy zoos or casinos, status symbols for the bored and stupid rich, or even staging boxing matches in Asian safari parks. All of this is despite the fact that, because they are all endangered, every great ape has the greatest protection offered by Cites: a ban on international trade. The continuation of the trade demonstrates the failure of implementation that undermines Cites. But Cites is starting to bare its teeth. Since 2007, orders from zoos and private owners in Asia have spurred the export of over 130 chimpanzees and 10 gorillas under falsified permits from Guinea. In response, this week, the nations on the governing committee of Cites hit Guinea with its ultimate sanction: a ban on trading any wild products at all. A far more incendiary move, in response to the continued and increasing slaughter of African elephants for their ivory, would be to cripple the vast trade in orchids, crocodile leather and other goods from China, Thailand and Vietnam, where the ivory ends up. That is now being talked about seriously at least. In the end enforcement depends on funding and that replies on political will at the top level.

The US, strongly supported by former cold war foe Russia, had argued that while climate change and the increasing loss of the Arctic sea ice on which polar bears hunt was the greatest threat to the 20,000 remaining in the wild, hunting was an intolerable additional pressure. The US delegation leader told the 178-nation meeting of the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species in Bangkok: &quot;Science paints a stark future for the polar bear. An [export ban] will give the polar bear a better chance to persist in the world until we can deal with climate change.&quot; But Canada \u2013 home to two-thirds of the world&apos;s polar bears and the only nation allowing exports \u2013 argued there is not enough scientific evidence to show they are in danger of population collapse. Canada says it already has strict rules to ensure hunting is sustainable, and the Canadian delegation leader has dismissed the US proposal as &quot;based more on emotion than science&quot;. The result was that 38 countries voted in favour of the US proposal, with 42 against, and 46 abstaining. Some countries did not attend to vote. Inuit delegates appealed to emotion in their own speeches. Terry Audla, president of the national organisation representing indigenous peoples of Arctic Canada, said: &quot;A ban would affect our ability to buy the necessities of life, to clothe our children. We have to protect our means of putting food on the table and selling polar bear hides enables us to support ourselves.&quot; About 600 polar bears bears are killed each year in Canada, some in traditional hunts by Inuit people and some as trophies for foreign hunters. Half the bears are then exported as skins or other body parts. The debate was acrimonious, with Audla accusing conservation groups of telling lies. Some nations complained that directly contradictory claims on how polar bear populations were faring had been put forward on each side. The controversy also split conservation groups, with WWF supporting Canada, saying that making political decisions without enough scientific evidence would severely undermined the Cites system, which controls all wildlife trade. But others including IFAW and NRDC said the science was clear that two-thirds of the 20,000-25,000 existing polar bears would be extinct by 2050. Most nations accept that the polar bear population is declining. But Cites rules require the projected decline to be more than 50% over three generations \u2013 45 years in the polar bear case. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature, an official adviser on science to Cites, said it was most likely polar bear populations would decline by 30% in the next 45 years and noted other predictions were more extreme. &quot;The world has once again had a chance to take action to safeguard polar bears and failed,&quot; said Jeffrey Flocken, North America director for the International Fund for Animal Welfare. &quot;Each year that this iconic species is not protected to the fullest is another year closer to losing the polar bear forever.&quot; Some delegates, from both nations supporting and opposing the ban, suggested the US move had been to compensate for a perceived lack of action on climate change in other areas and to help raise awareness of global warming with a sceptical US public. Audla said: &quot;The US is using the polar bear as a blunt tool to bring about climate change concerns \u2013 it is the perfect poster child.&quot; Sarah Uhlemann, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, said the US should take unilateral action against Canada: &quot;The world failed polar bears today. But the US has other avenues to pressure Canada to curtail its unsustainable hunt. We urge the Obama administration to act quickly to impose trade sanctions as required by US law.&quot; The UK, Germany and a significant number of other EU nations had supported the ban proposed by the US, but the Guardian understands that Denmark, with its historic links to Greenland, had not. This meant the EU, which votes as a bloc, abstained. Denmark broke ranks and voted no, as it is entitled to when also representing Greenland. A spokeswoman for Greenland, which has had a voluntary ban on polar bear exports since 2008, said: &quot;If we want to ensure the long term conservation of the polar bear, the focus should be directed to the countries which are emitters and polluters. Climate change is the real threat.&quot; An intended EU compromise, asking Canada to publish its export quotas and requesting Cites do an urgent review of polar bears, was opposed by both the US as being toothless and by Canada as casting doubt on its existing rules. The head of the EU delegation, Ireland&apos;s Feargal O&apos;Coigligh, denied the bloc&apos;s move had caused confusion and blamed the fact that polar bears received no new protection on the &quot;absolutist positions&quot; take by Canada on one side and the US and Russia on the other. Russia&apos;s delegate, Nikita Ovsyanikov, who is a leading polar bear expert, said: &quot;Polar bears are struggling for survival already and exposing them to hunting will drive them to extinction.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-03-07T06:18:00Z", "tags": ["Endangered species", "Endangered habitats", "Animals", "Environment", "World news", "Illegal wildlife trade", "Wildlife", "Conservation", "Polar regions"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/07/halt-polar-bear-trade-fails", "title": "Bid to halt polar bear trade fails", "sentences": ["The US delegation leader told the 178-nation meeting of the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species in Bangkok: &quot;Science paints a stark future for the polar bear."]}, {"article": "It all comes down, once again, to our old friend the precautionary principle. And, once again, the world has told our old friend to get stuffed. The 178 nations who make up the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species summit in Bangkok were essentially asked this question: is the future threat to polar bears from the rapid melting of sea ice by global warming so great that the additional pressure of hunting for rugs should be outlawed? The US, allied with Russia, argued yes, absolutely. They said the science showed two-thirds of the 20,000-25,000 polar bears will disappear by 2050. In fact, since that work was done, it has got even worse, they said: 2012 saw record low Arctic ice. Canada was diametrically opposed. It said &quot;the relationship between sea ice loss and polar bear declines is subject to uncertainty&quot;, a feeble line perfectly in sync with a government that abandoned the Kyoto protocol on climate change and relentlessly promotes filthy oil from tar sands. It said its export trade \u2013 300-400 polar bears a year as skins, teeth and paws - has no effect on populations. As the debate raged, national delegates from other countries got confused by the strident but conflicting claims. &quot;Where is the truth? Is it true that the polar bear is declining. Is it true that trade is increasing? We need to know,&quot; said the Egyptian delegate. An underlying scandal here is the astonishing conditions that need to be met before Canada&apos;s polar bear exports could meet Cites guidelines to be banned. For a species to be eligible for &quot;appendix one&apos; listing \u2013 the top level of protection which forbids international sales \u2013 Cites says it requires a devastated population, which will continue to plummet and in a habitat that is shrinking. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which provides official advice to Cites, examined these criteria. It found that to qualify, the polar bear population would have to crash to 5,000 animals and would have to be on course to lose 50% of its number in three generations \u2013 45 years. The IUCN said the &quot;most likely decline&quot; in that time would be &quot;more than 30%, but less than 50%&quot;. It added that the polar bear&apos;s range was several million square kilometres and &quot;clearly not restricted&quot;, not making any mention of the fast shrinking sea ice on which the bears rely to hunt seals. Allow me to sum that up: because the polar bear is not on the very brink of extinction, hanging on to an icy ledge by its claws alone, the 178 nations gathered here in Bangkok had a fig leaf for deciding to do nothing at all. Even Canada accepted the vanishing of a third of all polar bears is most likely. But it gets worse. In a subsequent vote, on protecting the West African manatee, the same nations decided throw that same fig leaf - IUCN opposition on technical grounds - to the floor and, as a precaution, back a ban on trade in manatee meat and oil. The European Union nations, pathetically in my view, abstained in the vote to ban Canada&apos;s polar bear exports. It was caught between the wishes of the UK, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and more who wanted to back the export ban and the intransigent opposition of Denmark and its satellite state Greenland. An EU &quot;compromise&quot; - which would not have banned the polar bear skin trade - failed too. That left the bloc blaming the total inaction, not on itself, but the &quot;absolutist positions&quot; of the US and Russia on one side and Canada on the other. In this festering mess of claim, counter-claim, emotional appeals and blame, it was ultimately shabby politics that prevented better protection for polar bears. There appears to be no issue that can shame Canada into behaving as an environmental good citizen, while the grandstanding of the US was no help in the end. No-one comes out of this well.

At the 178-nation Convention in Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) meeting, Burkina Faso and Kenya cited the &quot;merciless slaughter of elephants&quot; in their attempt to extend to a wider group of nations a pledge from some countries not to sell ivory stockpiles before 2016. But the proposal was seen as legally flawed by many delegates and failed to get support. But Tom Milliken, head of the elephant and rhino team at wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic, , said he was more optimistic than ever that tough action would still be taken. &quot;This time people are listening because everything is pointing in the same direction: poaching is up to a record high, as is illegal ivory trading and elephants seem to be down,&quot; he said. About 25,000 elephants were killed by poachers in 2012. At the Cites talks, 19 nations face bans on all wildlife trade unless they crack down on the poaching, smuggling or sale of illegal ivory. The summit is also considering compulsory forensic testing of seized tusks, so the criminal chain can be traced and compulsory reporting of stockpiles of ivory, to prevent corruption or thefts. Separately, Kenya attempted to prevent the export of trophy-hunted rhino horns from South Africa. Vietnamese and east European gangs use the practice as a cover to feed the illegal Vietnamese market with the 1,000 horns a year it is demanding. But Milliken said that South Africa had already put an end to the &quot;pseudo-hunting&quot;. There are 20,000 white rhinos at present, he said, and despite more than 600 being poached in 2012, the population is rising. Milliken said: &quot;It is probably a good idea to keep these [trophy-hunting] incentives for private wildlife reserve owners at a time when they are having to spend more on protection from poachers.&quot; He said, in contrast, Vietnam was doing extremely little to tackle rhino sales. The Cites meeting did, however, unanimously raise the protection of the west African manatee to the highest level, overriding advice from officials that &quot;scant&quot; scientific data did not support the move. The slow-moving creature, which can measure up to 4.5m long and weigh 350kg, is found in the coastal lagoons and rivers of 21 states, and can reach as far inland as Mali, Niger and Chad. Illegal kills can raise $4,500 per animal and less than 10,000 remain. They are hunted for meat and oil, killed as by bycatch by fishermen and also suffer as their habitat is destroyed by mangrove harvesting, pollution and dams. The Cites conference also bid farewell to a series of extinct animals by removing them from protection lists, including Australia&apos;s dusky flying fox, crescent nail-tail wallaby, buff-nosed rat-kangaroo and the pig-footed- and rabbit-eared bandicoots.", "publicationDate": "2013-03-07T16:57:18Z", "tags": ["Illegal wildlife trade", "Wildlife", "Conservation", "Animals", "Environment", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/07/cites-sale-ivory-rhino-horn-voted-down", "title": "Cites: bid to curb sale of ivory and rhino horn voted down", "sentences": ["Efforts to curb the sale of ivory and rhino horns were voted down on Thursday at an international wildlife summit in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Nearly 200 countries on Friday voted for tougher trade rules to protect dozens of species of turtles, in a day that saw the US and China joining forces for the first time ever, at an international wildlife summit in Thailand. Millions of turtles are targeted by obsessive western collectors, seekers of tonics for long life and as food for diners across Asia. Turtles have already been all but wiped out in the wild in east Asia, driven by the food and traditional medicine markets. Demand has grown at the same fast pace as economies have grown, especially in China, bringing millions more consumers into the market. The new rules discussed at the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species in Bangkok have come just in time for many species, said Dr Sandra Altherr, a biologist at German wildlife group, Pro Wildlife. &quot;Many of the turtles discussed today will be on sale tomorrow, at the world&apos;s biggest reptile fair in Germany, and fetching prices up to \u20ac10,000,&quot; she said. &quot;Their life strategy is to live for a long time, so their reproduction is slow and they just can&apos;t stand this exploitation.&quot; Turtles&apos; famed longevity has been double-edged, with the animals reputed to extend life and therefore sought after for traditional medicine and prized dishes. The variety and beauty of their shells also makes them highly attractive to collectors, which drives some turtles into a death spiral as the last remaining specimens become ever more valuable. Much of the trade is illegal, and many turtles die in transit to their market, but it continues on a massive scale due to lack of enforcement. The US told the Cites summit that the &quot;boom-and-bust&quot; pattern of the trade \u2013 in which traders hunt one species to near extinction before moving on to another \u2013 was spreading out from south-east Asia to the rest of the world. Turtles, also suffering the rapid loss of their habitats in rivers, lakes and coasts, are now the most endangered vertebrates in the world. China and the US, joining forces for the first time ever at Cites, led the way in boosting protection for 30 species of freshwater box turtles, small animals used for traditional medicine and food in Asia. The same duo also backed new restrictions on the trade of eight species of soft-shelled turtles, some of which are over a metre in length. Soft-shell turtles are considered to be the tastiest by Asian consumers, but many species are headed towards extinction in the wild. Biologists from 45 nations had backed the ban. Hundreds of millions of soft-shelled turtles are now farmed in China, but wild turtles have remained under heavy pressure. Among the turtles benefiting from new restrictions on trade is Indonesia&apos;s Roti Island snake-necked turtle, whose population has been decimated by the pet trade. At the German reptile fair, this species is listed for sale at \u20ac2,000 per animal. But Indonesia resisted US attempts at even tougher rules, saying highlighting its rarity would only encourage collectors. &quot;It would lead to increased hunting and more hunting in the wild,&quot; said Indonesia&apos;s delegate, adding it was attempting to reintroduce the turtle into the wild. All international trade in this turtle has now effectively been banned, as has trade in Vietnam&apos;s very colourful Indochinese box turtle, Annam leaf turtle and big-headed turtles, the latter being found only in high mountain streams. The Burmese star tortoise, whose unfortunate beauty has driven prices to $1,500 per animal in the pet trade, is now one of the rarest in the world. It was also banned from exports. The international trade in other turtles was not banned but regulated for the first time, ending a damaging free-for-all. The spotted turtle and Blanding&apos;s turtle gained this protection, as did the diamond back terrapin, all of which live in the US and Canada. The export of these turtles from the US has tripled in the last decade, with thousands being shipped out each year. Japan, often seen as a block on increased protection of wildlife, made a little Cites history. For the first time for any species, it asked the world&apos;s governments to help protect the rare Ryukyu black-breasted leaf turtle, which has suffered from the loss of its forest habitat and the poaching for the pet trade. &quot;For the pet trade, this new protection is a really big help,&quot; said Altherr, noting that western pet markets were quite closely monitored. &quot;But for food trade it may not have so much of an effect. It is very hard to control and additionally some of the turtles are very hard to tell apart.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-03-08T12:09:41Z", "tags": ["Illegal wildlife trade", "Endangered species", "Environment", "China", "US news", "Animals", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/08/tougher-trade-rules-turtles-cites", "title": "Tougher trade rules to protect turtles win support of nearly 200 nations", "sentences": ["The new rules discussed at the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species in Bangkok have come just in time for many species, said Dr Sandra Altherr, a biologist at German wildlife group, Pro Wildlife."]}, {"article": "The millions of sharks killed every year to feed the vast appetite for shark-fin soup in Asia now have greater protection, after the 178 nations at the world&apos;s biggest wildlife summit voted to crack down on the trade. Those fishing for oceanic whitetip, porbeagle and three species of hammerhead shark will now require strictly controlled permits to export the fins. The move is a landmark moment for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) because many previous attempts to protect marine species \u2013 including these sharks \u2013 have failed, largely due to opposition from Japan and China. Those nations argued other bodies have responsibility for fisheries, but their opponents, including the EU, US and Brazil, said Cites is far more effective and conservation campaigners were delighted. Manta rays also won new protection. &quot;Dealing with fisheries is always hard due the huge economic and political interests involved,&quot; said a delegate from one of the world&apos;s top fin-exporting nations. She added the cultural attachment to serving shark fin soup at weddings in China \u2013 now affordable for millions more in the country&apos;s swelling middle class \u2013 was very strong and very hard to break: &quot;It would be like telling the French not to have champagne at their wedding.&quot; Sharks are highly sought after but are slow to mature and have few offspring, making them extremely vulnerable to overfishing. The culling of 1 million oceanic whitetip sharks every year has resulted, for example, in its Pacific population crashing by 93% between 1995 and 2010. Today the species was given protection in a close vote that just achieved the two-thirds majority required. The porbeagle, once sought for its valuable meat especially for European markets, also saw a population crash, dropping 85% from 1981 to 2005 in the north and west Atlantic. In 2010, the EU had to halt fishing due to the tiny numbers left. The porbeagle shark lost out on protection in 2010 at Cites by one vote, but this summit, being held in Bangkok, saw a much wider coalition of 37 nations backing the shark proposals. The fins of the scalloped hammerhead are among the most valuable of all and it is estimated that 2 million a year are killed. They are one of the rare sharks to school together, making it easy to catch large numbers. The Cites summit also voted to protect the great and smooth hammerhead sharks, because their fins are very similar and could have been targeted if only the scalloped hammerhead was protected. Previous Cites meetings had seen similar protection proposals for sharks rejected, but new support from Latin American and west African countries, and the promise of cash from the European Union to help change fishing practices, won the day. The decisions could be reopened for debate at the final plenary session of the summit and potentially overturned. If, not all the measures will be implemented after an 18-month period in which enforcement measures can be set up. Scientists estimate that about 100m sharks are killed by humans every year, representing 6-8% of all sharks and far above a sustainable level. The shark fin trade is a global one, with Hong Kong at its hub, where 50% of all fins end up. Ten million kilogrammes of shark fins are shipped to its port every year, from 83 countries. Spain and Indonesia the leading sources, but other top 10 nations include countries such as Argentina, Nigeria, New Zealand and Iran. One-third of the 450 known species of shark are endangered by overfishing, but the species protected on Monday are the most valuable and sought after. Vessels are often officially fishing for tuna or swordfish but can in fact catch far more sharks, particularly the oceanic whitetip shark. By finning the fish at sea and throwing the bodies back, single trips can results in many thousands of dead sharks. The impact of the huge fishing fleets of Spain and France has been particularly severe on the porbeagle shark, whose meat is sold for a high price, and it has fallen by more than 95% in the Mediterranean an 90% in the north-east Atlantic. Prof Nick Dulvy of Simon Fraser University in Canada and a member of the International Union for Conservation of Nature expert panel on sharks, said wiping out populations of the fish often plays havoc with the ecosystem: &quot;When we remove the top predator, their prey can burgeon and affect the food chain all the way down.&quot; This can affect seafood prized by people, as happened off North Carolina when commercial fishing destroyed the big shark population, leaving rays to thrive which in turn destroyed bay scallops. &quot;We are thrilled that the tide is now turning for shark conservation, with governments listening to the science and acting in the interests of sustainability,&quot; said Elizabeth Wilson, manager of Pew&apos;s global shark campaign. &quot;With these new protections, they will have the chance to recover and once again fulfil their role as top predators.&quot; Manta rays, known by divers as friendly and inquisitive gentle giants with a seven-metre wingspan, also got new protection against exports at the Cites summit, backed by 80% of the voting nations. They are easy to catch but extremely slow to reproduce, delivering just one pup every two to five years. Their populations are being devastated off Sri Lanka and Indonesia to feed a newly created Chinese medicine market in which their gill plates, used to filter food from the ocean, are sold as a purifying tonic. Around 5,000 a year are killed, generating $5m for traders, but where protected they bring in $140m from tourism. Finally, the nations at the Cites summit chose unanimously to ban all international trade in a species of freshwater sawfish that is now restricted to northern Australia. They are virtually extinct over much of their former west Pacific range, and have not been seen for decades in Indonesia and Thailand. They were sought for their highly valuable fins ($4,000), their saws ($1,500) and by aquariums. Monday&apos;s vote means all sawfish species have been banned from international trade. Carlos Drews, head of WWF&apos;s Cites delegation, called the shark votes &quot;a landmark moment&quot;. Ralf Sonntag, shark specialist for the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said: &quot;This is a bold move by Cites. These sharks are worth far more alive than dead to local communities.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-03-11T12:07:00Z", "tags": ["Illegal wildlife trade", "Wildlife", "Conservation", "Animals", "Environment", "Marine life", "Oceans", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/11/shark-species-greater-protection-finning", "title": "Five shark species win protection against finning trade", "sentences": ["The porbeagle shark lost out on protection in 2010 at Cites by one vote, but this summit, being held in Bangkok, saw a much wider coalition of 37 nations backing the shark proposals."]}, {"article": "Every species of mahogany and rosewood tree in Madagascar gained new protection on Tuesday against a rampant logging trade that threatens to wipe out some species before they are even discovered. The 178 nations at the world&apos;s biggest wildlife summit agreed unanimously to strictly regulate the international trade in mahogany timber. The Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), taking place in Bangkok, also gave new protection to rosewood in Central America, Thailand and Vietnam. Ebony and rosewoods are targeted to make high-price furniture, musical instruments, chess pieces and flooring. &quot;There are 80 ebony species known in Madagascar but they are literally identifying more right now and there may be as many as 240 species in all,&quot; said Noel McGough, a botanist at Kew Botanical Gardens in London and a member of the UK delegation. He said the new protection, aimed at ensuring harvests are sustainable, had been urgently needed: &quot;We need to move quickly.&quot; &quot;Regulating the international trade will give the chance to feed money back to the poor local communities,&quot; he added. &quot;Illegal trade just drains money away from them.&quot; Recent years have seen a sharp rise in the exploitation of ebony in Madagascar, with much of the wood destined for Asian markets. For some species, no large trees remain in the wild, posing a serious threat to trees that take decades to produce the hard, dense, black wood that is sought after. The number of rosewood trees in Thailand is estimated to have declined as much as 70%, from around 300,000 in 2005 to 80,000-100,000 trees in 2011. Achim Steiner, the executive director of the UN Environment Programme (Unep), said Interpol and Unep estimated that 50-90% of logging in the key tropical countries around the world is being carried out by organised crime gangs. &quot;Illegal logging is worth well over $30bn annually to the criminals, whereas many of the poor people enlisted into these illegal activities get a pittance in return,&quot; he said. There were many ways criminals dealt in illegal timber, Steiner said, including falsifying logging permits, bribing officials to obtain permits, logging beyond concessions and hacking government websites to obtain or change electronic permits. In all, 135 species of Madagascan ebony and rosewoods were protected. John Scanlon, secretary-general of Cites, praised the achievement of the 178 member states, noting that previous discussions of valuable timber had been difficult. McGough said the tone of the debate on Tuesday was very different to that of recent decades: &quot;There were very divisive debates that set range states [where the trees grow] against importing countries and saw many proposals defeated or withdrawn in the face of mass opposition.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-03-12T13:19:30Z", "tags": ["Trees and forests", "Environment", "Madagascar", "Africa", "World news", "Illegal wildlife trade", "Wildlife", "Conservation", "Animals", "Deforestation", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/12/protection-madagascar-trees-logging-trade", "title": "New protection for endangered trees against rampant logging trade", "sentences": ["The Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), taking place in Bangkok, also gave new protection to rosewood in Central America, Thailand and Vietnam."]}, {"article": "If the American dream of the 21st century has relocated to China, Shanghai is today&apos;s New York. That, at least, is the vibrant impression created by Tash Aw&apos;s third novel, set in a frenetic megacity of 20 million people, where fortunes are made and lost with vertiginous speed against the highrise Pudong skyline. &quot;When you&apos;re in Shanghai, you feel an energy so blinding that you get swept up,&quot; Aw says. &quot;It&apos;s only when you leave that it feels unreal.&quot; Five Star Billionaire depicts the Chinese dream in a snakes-and-ladders universe of opportunity and ruin, through the eyes of Chinese Malaysians \u2013 from tycoons to factory girls \u2013 trying their luck in the new China. For Aw, whose own ancestors made the reverse journey out of southern China to Malaya, and who moved to England as a student in\u00a0the early 1990s, this novel is about the people he grew up with, and is his &quot;most personal&quot; book. His 2005 debut, The Harmony Silk Factory, set in 1940s British Malaya on the brink of Japanese invasion, won the Costa (Whitbread) first novel award and a Commonwealth Writers prize. It was on various longlists, including the Man Booker and the International Impac Dublin prize, and has been translated into more than 20 languages. The Indonesian setting of his second novel, Map of the Invisible World, published four years later, marked Aw, now 41, as part of a rising generation of south-east-Asian-born writers who are remapping the region with little heed to existing national frontiers. Aw, who has a kinship with Tan Twan Eng, author of the Booker-shortlisted The Garden of Evening Mists, casts one\u00a0eye on the past in a place whose full-throttle growth leaves scant time for the backward glance. &quot;I&apos;m not naturally nostalgic for a cosy, bygone era,&quot; he says, &quot;but a lot of my work is concerned with what we give up in the march forwards.&quot; He lives alone in a basement flat near Old Street in east London, with a tiny garden in which he grows bamboo and banana palms. Bashful about being there for 12 years, he murmurs: &quot;There&apos;s a lack of momentum.&quot; He visits Asia &quot;several times a year&quot;, and\u00a0can reel off the merits of its cities and street food from Bali to Penang. Compared with Bangkok, Manila and Jakarta, he says, &quot;Shanghai is the only big city where you can go for a stroll. It&apos;s slower and very seductive, with real soul and romance.&quot; A Malaysian national, and now teaching in Singapore for part of the year, he launched his new novel in the city-state last month, and in Malaysia, both of which he sees as &quot;home territory&quot;. Twenty years ago, he says, &quot;people of my generation would gravitate towards the great cities of the west,&quot; but he began travelling to China a decade ago because he &quot;was struck that more and more people seeking a better life abroad seemed to be heading to China&quot;. The new novel was sparked by some &quot;weird coincidences&quot;, he says. &quot;I kept bumping into people who knew people who knew me from childhood. I&apos;d hear Malaysian accents across a restaurant, then actively search them out.&quot; Glancing connections emerge between five main characters, including a &quot;philanthropist&quot; who writes self-help books, and a spa receptionist who devours them. There is a pop idol who disgraced himself in a brawl, a political radical turned businesswoman and a\u00a0real estate dealer who burns out, his own desires subordinate to crushing family duty. As Aw sees it, &quot;his secure place comes at a price. One sees that a\u00a0lot in Asia.&quot; The chapter headings, such as &quot;Move to Where the Money Is&quot;, borrow from Chengyu \u2013 Chinese idioms of parental advice \u2013 that have been hijacked within contemporary culture to serve a ruthless self-advancement. He read over people&apos;s shoulders on the Shanghai Metro. &quot;Eight out of 10 bestsellers in Asian bookshops are self-help books. They&apos;ve adopted the worst American excesses and run with them.&quot; That may be most evident in advice to women on &quot;How to snare a rich husband&quot;. He laments the &quot;culture of\u00a0&apos;remaindered women&apos;, who are still single after the age of 26 \u2013 which is every woman I know in Shanghai. They have the outward trappings of modern, feminist success, but their lives are geared to despairingly searching for a husband. It&apos;s atavistic.&quot; In a novel of missed connections, characters can prove as fake as the handbags in Shanghai&apos;s markets. &quot;People are incredibly lonely in this huge city, twice the size of London,&quot; Aw says. &quot;They&apos;re swept up by the tide of energy and forget what they&apos;re looking for. The don&apos;t just want money or a business deal, but something deeper.&quot; Two writer&apos;s residencies in Shanghai between 2009 and 2011 helped him shed some prejudices, on internet censorship, for example: &quot;People think\u00a0the Chinese must live in total ignorance, but Chinese my age are so skilled, they have access to everything they want. There are blogs and Twitter \u2013 but in Chinese, so most people don&apos;t read them. I saw more freedom of speech in Shanghai than I see in Singapore or Thailand.&quot; China &quot;exists on so many levels. The official level is\u00a0incredibly chauvinist, and the patriarchal system drives me nuts \u2013\u00a0it\u00a0reminds me of my upbringing. But\u00a0when you get past that it&apos;s like any\u00a0other Asian city: there&apos;s a colour, vitality, local and regional identities.&quot; When in Shanghai, he lived in a block where the average age was over 70, and people had endured China&apos;s cultural revolution of 1966-76. &quot;But even though they&apos;ve been through such a lot, I was the recipient of so many acts\u00a0of kindness every day.&quot; His understanding has another source. &quot;I\u00a0have first cousins from a branch that didn&apos;t make it out of rural Malaysia, from a horrible little village. My parents were lucky \u2013 they went to college and moved to Kuala Lumpur, so\u00a0I had a suburban childhood. To them, China represents opportunity. When I see it through their eyes, it&apos;s a\u00a0marvellous thing.&quot; He was born in 1971 in Taipei, to Malaysian parents working in the Taiwanese capital. His father was an electrical engineer, and his mother a quantity surveyor. By the time he came back to Malaysia he already felt like an\u00a0outsider. He grew up in ethnic Chinese neighbourhoods. His\u00a0parents were from &quot;very poor backgrounds&quot;, their families part of the large-scale migration from China to Malaya from the 19th century to the 1930s. Aw, who grew up speaking Malay, Mandarin, Cantonese and English, regrets that he\u00a0never learned his father&apos;s Hainanese dialect, a &quot;magical, warm, rich and unsual language. It wasn&apos;t considered an educated dialect so he didn&apos;t speak to us in it.&quot; Nor did he know his mother&apos;s Hokkien dialect, so he found it\u00a0hard to communicate with his cousins, which reinforced his sense of\u00a0being an outsider. All his grandparents lived &quot;deep in\u00a0the heart of the Malaysian jungle&quot;, in the Kinta valley, the setting for his first novel. He recalls &quot;terrifying and exciting&quot; school holidays in his grandmother&apos;s house on the banks of a &quot;big muddy river&quot;, where his uncle still lives. &quot;Big extended Chinese families can be warm and enveloping, not just ghastly structures. But the house was rudimentary, with monitor lizards eating shit off the outside toilets, and rats in the rooms.&quot; During the second world war, the area had been a support base for Chinese communist guerrilla resistance to the Japanese occupation of 1942-45. &quot;So entire villages were singled out for brutal treatment by the Japanese army. I&apos;m not sure if my maternal grandfather was tortured, but I know that behind the silence there were untold stories.&quot; While, to his own generation, &quot;Japan meant cool, electronic gadgets,&quot; his\u00a0parents grew up with\u00a0&quot;anti-Japanese sentiment in their blood&quot;. That animosity might have been behind their perverse choice of a\u00a0Ford Cortina when Malaysia&apos;s prime minister Mahathir Mohamad launched his &quot;Buy British Last&quot; campaign in 1981,\u00a0and urged the country to look east\u00a0towards Japan. &quot;The wave of nationalism was strange,&quot; Aw recalls. &quot;The street names were changed to Malaysian ones, but the middle classes were still speaking to each other in English.&quot; In the late 1970s and 80s, &quot;we were distracted because we were all getting richer. I was only a teenager, but I knew something was not right; that we should be thinking more about where we came from and who we were. Who\u00a0are the indigenous people, the bumiputra or &apos;sons of the earth&apos;? There\u00a0have been immigrant Chinese families in Malaysia for 200 years. Where do they fit, if not as part of the fabric of the country?&quot; One cost of what Aw terms &quot;this crazy march forward&quot; was the &quot;gleeful destruction of old buildings in the name of anti-colonialism. It&apos;s only now, when we&apos;re settled and affluent, that we think: &apos;Oh my God, what did we do?&apos; Old mansions have been replaced by giant, soulless shopping malls.&quot; In his ambitions as a writer, Aw had\u00a0&quot;zero role models. My parents encouraged reading, but to pass exams.&quot; He came to Cambridge to study law in 1991. Writing his first novel, he worked as an auction-house porter and a Chinese-language tutor, before the need for money drove him into a law firm for four years. He quit in 2002 to enrol at the University of East Anglia&apos;s creative writing school (&quot;very cutthroat&quot;) and sold his debut novel by the end of the academic year. Though keen on Conrad, he found much writing about his native region, from Anthony Burgess to JG Farrell, &quot;unsatisfactory \u2013 it didn&apos;t speak to me&quot;. Somerset Maugham was &quot;invariably writing about white people \u2013 except for\u00a0coolies or servants, who were slightly shifty&quot;. Though he admires the\u00a0Malaysian writer KS Maniam, he felt, along with Tan, that &quot;we had to reinvent the south-east Asian novel&quot;. His narratives circle events, viewing the\u00a0same scenes through different eyes \u2013 reflecting his quarrel with &quot;how history is rewritten in a country like Malaysia. A lot of modern Asian narratives seek refuge in homogeneity. But we know it\u00a0doesn&apos;t exist.&quot; He grew up with TV dramas and music from the giant neighbour, Indonesia. Map of the Invisible World is\u00a0a tale of two separated orphans during President Sukarno&apos;s &quot;year of living dangerously&quot;, a time of anti-communist purges. The two countries, Aw says, are spoken of as brothers, united by a common language and religion. &quot;We were supposed to bond against the Zionist-supporting Singapore, with its pork-eating Chinese population. But people forget Malaysia was Sukarno&apos;s arch enemy&quot;, during Konfrontasi \u2013 Indonesia&apos;s undeclared war against Malaysia. Aw&apos;s impulse was the &quot;sense of losing our past. My parents&apos; generation lived through it, but mine had no idea.&quot; Countries are &quot;absurdly retreating into the security of borders&quot;, he says, &quot;but coming from a small country, you can&apos;t help but see Malaysia&apos;s place in a wider world&quot;. That vision may chime with a growing readership in Asia&apos;s burgeoning leisured classes, with the new-found time to look back.

In fact every week of the year, somewhere on the planet, a fashion week takes place beneath the radar: this month alone, Beirut, Bangkok and Reykjavik will welcome models, buyers and the fashion press to their catwalks. As recently as two years ago, many of these events didn&apos;t exist. Now you can see bare shoulders on catwalks in Islamabad and shows that address religious and social divides in Tel Aviv; even hard-up Haiti delighted onlookers by hosting its first fashion week in November. It&apos;s not just a measure of economic progress in the developing world \u2013 it&apos;s proof that, as fashion goes global, countries that were seen as the cheap labour to which the west outsourced its dirty work are claiming back their industry. These fledgling events are fast evolving. At the first-ever fashion week in Cambodia, I was roped into modelling when resources were scarce: now Vogue and FashionTV are bumping shoulderpads in the front rows. That these showcases of local talent are starting to turn heads \u2013 influential fashion bloggers and international press now pay close attention to the designs \u2013 is hardly surprising.

And while it&apos;s unlikely that next season Burberry will reinvent the trench in traditional Ankara textiles, in a nod to the self-taught designers of Gabon there are other trends that have the power to change the industry for the better \u2013 you can&apos;t argue with the healthy curves of the models striding down Latin American catwalks, and Israel has passed a law banning the use of models with an unhealthily low body mass index.

Click here to view video South Korea is investigating a suspected cyber-attack that paralysed systems at major media and banks on Wednesday, amid speculation that the North could be responsible.\u00a0  The computer networks of three broadcasters\u00a0- KBS, MBC and YTN - and two banks, Shinhan and Nonghyup, froze at around 2pm local time. Shinhan said its ATMs, payment terminals and mobile banking in the South were affected. TV broadcasts were not affected.  Warnings reportedly appeared on some computer screens from a previously unknown group calling itself the &quot;WhoisTeam&quot;, showing skulls and a message stating it was only the beginning of &quot;our movement&quot;. A presidential aide said it had not been determined whether North Korea was involved, state news agency Yonhap reported.  The South&apos;s communications watchdog raised its alert level on cyber-attacks to level three on a five-tier scale, tripling the number of staff monitoring the situation. A police official told Reuters: &quot;We sent down teams to all affected sites. We are now assessing the situation. This incident is pretty massive and will take a few days to collect evidence.&quot; Defence minister Kim Kwan-jin covened an emergency security meeting and raised the military&apos;s cyberattack readiness level from three to four on the five-tier system, Yonhap reported.  The banks have since restored their operations, but the television stations could not say when they would be able to get their systems back up. Some workers at the stations could not boot their computers. The development comes amid high tensions on the Korean peninsula. Pyongyang reacted furiously after the United Nations Security Council tightened sanctions earlier this month because of its latest nuclear test.  Last week it accused the United States and South Korea of staging cyber attacks against it\u00a0following a two day internet outage that disrupted its main news services and websites.\u00a0Access to the internet is restricted to a tiny proportion of the North&apos;s population, perhaps a few thousand. A spokesman for Bangkok-based Loxley Pacific, the broadband internet provider for North Korea, told the Associated Press on Friday that the origin of that attack was unclear. The South denied involvement and the US military declined to comment. Daniel Pinkston, north east Asia project director for the International Crisis Group, said the timing of today&apos;s problems was interesting given Pyongyang&apos;s accusations of US cyber-attacks, and said that there were ongoing concerns about North Korea developing its hacking capabilities. Last year the top US commander in the region told a Congressional hearing: &quot;North Korea employs sophisticated computer hackers trained to launch cyber infiltration and cyber attacks.&quot;  James Thurman, the commander of US Forces Korea, suggested they were &quot;increasingly employed against a variety of targets including military, governmental, educational and commercial institutions.&quot; Experts believe the South has been previously targeted by hackers from the North. Anti-virus firm McAfee said it believed a 10-day denial of service attack in 2011 originated from the North and suggested it was an attempt to test the South&apos;s computer defences in preparation for potential future conflicts. Another attack on a newspaper last year was also blamed on North Korean hackers.  &quot;It&apos;s got to be a hacking attack,&quot; Lim Jong-in, dean of Korea University&apos;s Graduate School of Information Security, told the Associated Press. &quot;Such simultaneous shutdowns cannot be caused by technical glitches.&quot; He warned that it would take months to determine the source of the attacks.", "publicationDate": "2013-03-20T10:00:00Z", "tags": ["South Korea", "Cybercrime", "North Korea", "Hacking", "US foreign policy", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Technology"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/20/south-korea-under-cyber-attack", "title": "South Korea on alert for cyber-attacks after major network goes down", "sentences": ["A spokesman for Bangkok-based Loxley Pacific, the broadband internet provider for North Korea, told the Associated Press on Friday that the origin of that attack was unclear."]}, {"article": "South Africa&apos;s environmental affairs minister has backed a radical proposal to legalise the international trade in rhino horn as a means of neutralising the black market and saving the threatened species. Edna Molewa said she believes legalisation could be a solution to the scourge of rhino poaching, which saw a record 668 of the animals killed in South Africa last year, fuelled by demand for horn in south-east Asia. But her stand is likely to be met with fierce opposition from conservationists. &quot;We believe it is the right direction as one of the measures,&quot; Molewa told South Africa&apos;s Mail &amp; Guardian newspaper during a recent Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) meeting in Bangkok. &quot;The model that we have is based on pure law of supply and demand. Economics 101. &quot;Our rhinos are killed every day and the numbers are going up. The reality is that we have done all in our power and doing the same thing every day isn&apos;t working. We do think that we need to address this issue of trade in a controlled manner so that we can at least begin to push down this pressure.&quot; South Africa is likely to support legalisation at the next Cites conference in Cape Town in 2016, the Mail &amp; Guardian reported. Rhino horn sales have been banned for more than 30 years under Cites. Poaching has escalated in recent years despite countless initiatives including armed patrols and aerial surveillance. At least 158 rhinos have been slaughtered already this year, most in the celebrated Kruger national park. At the current rate, deaths will outstrip births by 2016, described by conservationists as a tipping point. Molewa joins a vocal minority who have been lobbying hard for legalisation as a necessary step. Among them is John Hume, South Africa&apos;s biggest private owner with more than 800 rhinos, who argues that the animals could be periodically dehorned safely and humanely. Hume acknowledges that he would be one of the main financial beneficiaries. &quot;I am very pleased with the ministers&apos;s response and feel that it is high time that the government adopted this stance,&quot; Hume said on Monday. &quot;I sincerely hope that our government makes a decision to trade in rhino horn very soon and that they take such a proposal forward vigorously and intensively.&quot; He added: &quot;Our rhinos are rapidly running out of time and the current poaching onslaught is truly devastating. We strongly feel that legalising the trade in rhino horn is the only way to go in order to save the rhino.&quot; But the move has long been opposed by groups such as Traffic and the WWF. There are fears that a legitimate supply of horn would send mixed messages to consumer markets that are little understood and lack regulation. It could potentially stimulate more demand in countries such as Vietnam, where horn is seen as a delicacy or of medicinal value by the expanding middle class. Will Travers, chief executive of the Born Free Foundation, was quoted by the Mail &amp; Guardian as saying: &quot;So what are they saying by legalising the rhino horn trade? Here is a product that every sensible scientist says has no significant impact and they are going to sell it at huge cost to a public that is ill-informed. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t go to sleep at night if I thought I was selling something like that to a Vietnamese family who have scrimped and saved every cent to buy rhino horn for their dying grandmother, who then goes and dies.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-03-25T15:23:54Z", "tags": ["Endangered species", "South Africa", "Wildlife", "Conservation", "Animals", "Environment", "Africa", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/25/south-africa-rhino-horn-trade", "title": "South African minister backs legalisation of rhino horn trade", "sentences": ["&quot;We believe it is the right direction as one of the measures,&quot; Molewa told South Africa&apos;s Mail &amp; Guardian newspaper during a recent Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) meeting in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Merlin Entertainments, the owner of Madame Tussauds, Legoland and Alton Towers, is hoping to take a ride on a stock market flotation after revenues topped \u00a31bn last year. Analysts said the company could list with a valuation of up to \u00a33.5bn, three years after it walked away from a planned \u00a3bn initial public offering (IPO). Expansion in the US and Asia helped offset tougher times in Europe last year \u2013 where it was hit by miserable weather and competition from the London Olympics \u2013 lifting revenues by 15% to \u00a31.07bn in the year to December. Operating profits rose 16.5% to \u00a3258m as visitor numbers to the group&apos;s 94 international theme parks and attractions rose 16% to 54m. Nick Varney, the chief executive, said: &quot;We are currently giving active consideration to potential options for an IPO which preferably, but not definitely, would be in the UK.&quot; He said Merlin, which pulled plans for a public listing in 2010, was talking to potential investors and weighing up whether to list in London or the US some time in this year or next. &quot;We are well invested with a strong brand, world-class quality product and the City is familiar with us as a company,&quot; he said. Analysts agreed that Merlin would be an attractive proposition for investors, if priced correctly. They said they would like the level of debt, which is about 3.5 times underlying earnings, to come down slightly but that would not stand in the way of a successful flotation. Merlin ended 2012 with \u00a31.27bn of debt, broadly the same as a year before, after spending \u00a392m on improving its existing sites and \u00a371m on new businesses. &quot;IPO markets are open again in the UK and Merlin is a very good business that has been well run. Despite the recession, people continue to spend money on leisure and Merlin has some great assets that it would be difficult to replicate,&quot; said Nick Batram, an analyst at Peel Hunt. Visitor numbers at Merlin&apos;s UK attractions were flat last year as the weather hit outdoor parks such as Alton Towers but benefited indoor attractions such as the London Dungeon. Legoland Windsor, boasting a new themed hotel, was one of the few outdoor parks to see a rise. The group&apos;s top performers were overseas ventures such as its Madame Tussauds attractions in Asia and Legoland in California. A fifth of turnover now comes from North America and 14% from Asia and the Pacific region, which accounted for just 2% of sales two years ago. Varney said he expected a bounce back in the UK this year as there would be no competition from the Olympics, which drew 10m visitors away from alternative days out. Elsewhere, Merlin is opening Legoland Discovery Centres in Canada, Germany and Westchester, New York; a new Madame Tussauds in Tokyo; a Dungeon in Berlin and a Sea Life Centre in Manchester. It will also open a 250-bedroom Legoland hotel at its California park, as it continues its strategy of adding themed accommodation at its parks. The scariest new ride will be The Smiler at Alton Towers, which is still under construction. &quot;It&apos;s the first ride I&apos;ve looked at and wondered if I could go on it,&quot; said Varney. &quot;It&apos;s a spaghetti of twists and turns and loops and we&apos;ve been adding psychological tricks that make you feel like you&apos;ve been hypnotised.&quot; Merlin worldwide: Numbers of attractions \u2022 44 Sea Life centres, including the UK, Germany, Spain, Italy and Germany \u2022 14 Madame Tussauds, including Bangkok, Shanghai and Las Vegas \u2022 10 Legoland discovery centres, including Manchester, Tokyo and Chicago \u2022 8 Dungeons, including The London Dungeon and Hamburg Dungeon \u2022 6 Legoland parks, including Windsor and California \u2022 5 theme parks, including Alton Towers and Chessington World of Adventures \u2022 It also owns two ski resorts, The London Eye, Blackpool Tower \u2022 Tree Top adventure parks based in Australia and Warwick Castle", "publicationDate": "2013-03-27T20:20:21Z", "tags": ["Travel & leisure", "Business", "Stock markets", "Investing", "Financial sector", "UK news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/27/madame-tussauds-owner-stock-market-flotation", "title": "Legoland owner eyes move on to stock market", "sentences": ["&quot;It&apos;s a spaghetti of twists and turns and loops and we&apos;ve been adding psychological tricks that make you feel like you&apos;ve been hypnotised.&quot; Merlin worldwide: Numbers of attractions \u2022 44 Sea Life centres, including the UK, Germany, Spain, Italy and Germany \u2022 14 Madame Tussauds, including Bangkok, Shanghai and Las Vegas \u2022 10 Legoland discovery centres, including Manchester, Tokyo and Chicago \u2022 8 Dungeons, including The London Dungeon and Hamburg Dungeon \u2022 6 Legoland parks, including Windsor and California \u2022 5 theme parks, including Alton Towers and Chessington World of Adventures \u2022 It also owns two ski resorts, The London Eye, Blackpool Tower \u2022 Tree Top adventure parks based in Australia and Warwick Castle"]}, {"article": "A few years ago, Rana Dasgupta wrote an eye-opening article in Granta about India&apos;s new rich, in which he explained that the country&apos;s economic growth had\u00a0been far too explosive for the small English-speaking upper class to monopolise its rewards. The old cosmopolitan elite have done well enough, with their degrees from Berkeley and Cambridge, and their jobs in banking and management consulting: &quot;But they are surrounded by very different people \u2013 private businessmen, entrepreneurs, estate agents, retailers and general wheeler-dealers \u2013 who are making far more money than they are, and wielding more political power. These people may come from smaller cities, they may be less worldly, and they may speak only poor English. But they are skilled in the realm of opportunity and profit, and they are at home in the booming world of overlords, connections, bribes, political loopholes, sweeteners \u2013 and occasional violence \u2013 that sends their anglicised peers running for the nearest cappuccino.&quot; In Mohsin Hamid&apos;s dazzling third novel, we follow the rise and fall of one of these wheeler-dealers, these new lords of opportunity and profit. How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia is set in Pakistan, not India, in a &quot;megalopolis&quot; that mostly resembles Hamid&apos;s home town, Lahore (though neither the country nor the city is named \u2013 in fact there&apos;s hardly a proper noun in sight). This might come as a surprise in Britain, where we hear a lot about the &quot;new India&quot;, while Pakistan \u2013 which has seen a comparable, if more limited, boom \u2013 is generally portrayed as the poor, backward neighbour, afflicted by Islamist terrorism, insurgency and floods. But this is a novel that aims to strip resaders of their preconceptions. Hamid shows us the same powerful forces are at work in a Pakistani megacity as in Bombay or Delhi or Bangkok. And\u00a0while the new breed of entrepreneurs are often portrayed as unscrupulous or grotesque, like the murderous taxi tycoon in Aravind Adiga&apos;s scabrous The\u00a0White Tiger, Hamid asks us to consider that they might in fact be rational, honourable people responding as best they can to their environment \u2013 just like you or me. Or, more specifically, like you, since the book is written in the second person, in the style of Jay McInerney&apos;s 1984 Bright Lights, Big City or a role-playing story. At first sight, it poses as a\u00a0self-help book. The chapter titles take the form of instructions to the reader: &quot;Move to the city&quot;, &quot;Get an education&quot;, &quot;Work for yourself&quot;, &quot;Befriend a bureaucrat&quot;, and so on. But\u00a0after a couple of paragraphs of ironic motivational talk, each chapter moves into a narrative mode: &quot;you&quot; are a poor village boy, first seen &quot;huddled, shivering, on the packed earth under your mother&apos;s cot one cold, dewy morning&quot;. At your mother&apos;s insistence, your family moves from the village to the city to join your father, who works as a\u00a0domestic chef: &quot;As you and your parents dismount [from the bus], you embody one of the great changes of your time.&quot; Thereafter, you are seen going to school, while earning money for the family on the side as a pirate-DVD delivery boy; then working as a &quot;non-expired-labeled expired goods salesman&quot; (knocking off out-of-date cans of tuna with new labels). Step by step, you find your true calling, in the fake bottled-water trade. You start off with a back-room operation: a donkey pump, a water tank, a gas-burner, a filter and a pile of old mineral water bottles. But soon you hit the big time, and before long you have your own semi-legit factory out in the ballooning industrial suburbs. Hamid&apos;s debut, Moth Smoke, was formally conventional, though its subject matter caused a stir \u2013 imagine a McInerney party novel, set in Lahore, with bootleg whisky, cheap heroin and nuclear neighbours. But these days he seems to specialise in ambitious, highly compressed novellas, which address the reader in an unusual and slightly tricksy fashion. He&apos;s best known in this country for The Reluctant Fundamentalist, a 9/11 novel about a Pakistani financial worker falling out of love with America. Like Camus&apos;s The Fall, it was written in the form of a monologue, from one man in a caf\u00e9 to another. How to Get Filthy Rich also pulls a few fairly complex moves. Initially, it seems to be a satire powered by a cool, rational fury about the conditions of life in Pakistan \u2013 from the landlords whose gaze the villagers are not permitted to meet, to the place-holders and rent-seekers who run schools and politics alike, to the undrinkable water: &quot;Your city&apos;s neglected pipes are cracking, the contents of underground water mains and sewers mingling, with the result that taps in locales rich and poor alike disgorge fluids that, while for the most part clear and odourless, reliably contain trace levels of feces and microorganisms capable of causing diarrhea, hepatitis, dysentery and typhoid.&quot; At another level, the book is a love story disguised as a satire. &quot;You&quot; fall in\u00a0love, with a woman known as &quot;the pretty girl&quot;, who comes from the same city slum, and works her way up into modelling and acting. The lovers are driven apart by circumstance, but re-enter each other&apos;s lives at significant moments. Finally, in its later stages, How to Get Filthy Rich becomes a meditation on mortality in the form of\u00a0a love story. Furthermore, it becomes clear as the book proceeds that each chapter corresponds to a significant span of &quot;your&quot; life, and is set in the historical present. If, like me, you don&apos;t know Pakistan, then this only gradually becomes clear, when the technology stays the same though decades pass in the lives of the characters; and when the few news incidents alluded to, such as\u00a0the 2008 truck-bombing of the Marriott hotel in Islamabad, don&apos;t seem to fit into any comprehensible time scheme. In short, there&apos;s a hell of\u00a0a lot going on in the 200 or so widely spaced pages of How to Get Filthy Rich. Some readers might find that the novel trips up from time to\u00a0time on its own conceits; but it is\u00a0an\u00a0addictive, muscular piece of storytelling, and the few moments of clumsiness and archness that Hamid&apos;s formal experiments produce are a price well worth paying. Hamid is a great admirer of Pereira Maintains by Antonio Tabucchi, a 1994 novella written in the form of a testimony given, we are led to believe by its amiable Portuguese hero, to a secret policeman. In his introduction, Hamid writes that he likes this device, because &quot;we are unsettled and given more to do. An unexpected interpretative space opens up before us, nags at us, seduces us. We feel more like characters than we are used to.&quot; Similarly, his chosen form of address in How to Get Filthy Rich co-opts the reader as a character (&quot;So you have grown a beard and joined a religious organisation,&quot; Hamid writes, and indeed makes it seem like a sensible career move.) It also allows him to move between a very intimate perspective and an objective, generalising one. Similarly, the compression of the book&apos;s time zones enables him to portray a dozen different levels of Pakistani society at once, giving a sense of people inhabiting entirely different worlds at the same time. The\u00a0bus ride from village to city appears &quot;to\u00a0span millennia&quot;; &quot;buildings go from mud to brick to concrete, then shoot up to an unimaginable four stories, even five&quot;. Perhaps all this makes How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia sound a little complicated. It isn&apos;t, really. In fact, it is quite a simple proposition: it shows a writer at the height of his powers, with a hell of a story to tell. Like most good novels, it is in one sense archetypal \u2013 rags-to-riches, boy-meets-girl \u2013 while in another, it is highly specific to the society in which it is set: feudalism, the clan system, radical Islam and water shortages are all there, woven into the fabric of the story. Unlike The\u00a0Reluctant Fundamentalist, it&apos;s not\u00a0decorous and elegant. It&apos;s rude and\u00a0gaudy, loaded with sentences that positively bulge with their desire to bear witness, whether to the construction boom (&quot;a ribbon of convenience stores, auto garages, scrap-metal dealers, unregistered educational institutes, fly-by-night dental clinics, and mobile-phone top-up and repair points\u2026&quot;) or to certain sharply drawn social types (the\u00a0&quot;cocaine-snorting man-child too chronically insecure to appear in his father&apos;s head office much earlier than 11 or to stay much later than three, prone to picking up teenage girls at parties in his muscular European limousine and to sobbing unpredictably when drunk&quot;).

Relocation into wild habitats has been achieved in many cases already. True, it requires great care and a lot of ongoing effort. What makes the process now an impossibility for many species is nothing to do with the genes of the captive-bred animals. It is to do with the state of the wild. Wild habitats are being reduced at alarming rates, over-populating what is left. The short-term prospect, until such time as our own species stops trashing the planet by its own gross over-population, is bleak, but it is not hopeless. The problem facing all wild species is that our species has yet to readjust itself in balance with the limited resources available to it. When that happens, as we must all hope, it will be the time to repopulate the wild with those species which, without captive breeding, would otherwise have become extinct.Dr Michael BrambellDirector of Chester Zoo, 1978-95 \u2022 The new Tiger Territory at London Zoo, following hard on the heels of the zoo&apos;s Gorilla Kingdom (almost \u00a310m between the two) and Edinburgh Zoo&apos;s dalliance with captive giant pandas (another \u00a36m) does surely call into question whether endangered species are getting the best possible support when the challenges of survival in the wild are so pressing. Having just returned from the Cites conference in Bangkok, where the global zoo community (10,000 zoos and hundreds of thousands if not millions of zoo professionals) were largely conspicuous by their absence, it seemed clear to me and the Born Free team that the impact of this multi-billion pound global industry on the future of species and their habitats is largely negligible. The handful that try to make a meaningful contribution provide barely a fig leaf to cover the zoo body-corporate but they cannot conceal the paucity of what zoos actually deliver compared with the conservation and education rhetoric they espouse. Time is short. Species need help now. As you say in your editorial, &quot;It doesn&apos;t stack up&quot;. Will TraversCEO, Born Free Foundation \u2022 Ruth Padel whose article on the importance of modern zoos (Review, 23 March) offsets your leader. Rearing animals in captivity for wild release is a specialist process quite different from keeping them in zoos, but there&apos;s every reason for zoo animals to be the parents if the endangered species are extinct in the wild or too rare to capture. As Padel points out, zoos are an important means to educate the public about the problems and to gain funding. Keeping some in captivity is the lesser of two evils.Anthony ChekeOxford", "publicationDate": "2013-03-29T21:00:31Z", "tags": ["Endangered species", "Zoology", "Biology", "Wildlife", "Conservation", "Animals", "Environment", "Endangered habitats"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/29/animals-free-captivity-saving-species", "title": "Letters: Are animals born free or in captivity the key to saving species?", "sentences": ["Having just returned from the Cites conference in Bangkok, where the global zoo community (10,000 zoos and hundreds of thousands if not millions of zoo professionals) were largely conspicuous by their absence, it seemed clear to me and the Born Free team that the impact of this multi-billion pound global industry on the future of species and their habitats is largely negligible."]}, {"article": "She&apos;s played Gertrude to Ben Whishaw&apos;s Hamlet, and a superlative Duchess of Malfi \u2013 not to mention more leading theatre roles than almost anyone of her generation. The last time she was on stage, in Tennessee Williams&apos;s remarkable Orpheus Descending last October, my colleague Lyn Gardner compared her grippingly tense performance to &quot;a pan of boiling water with the lid tight&quot;.  Though she&apos;s only a few nights away from opening her latest London show, Dermot Canavan&apos;s Third Finger, Left Hand, Imogen Stubbs has gamely volunteered out to break out from final rehearsals and pop into the Guardian to answer your questions \u2013 so here&apos;s your chance to ask her anything you want.  Perhaps you want to find out what&apos;s kept her going through nearly 30 years on stage and screen \u2013 and whether there really are enough parts for female actors over the age of 30. Maybe you want to know what it was like to play Desdemona to Willard White&apos;s Othello. It could be you want to tease out what she most regrets (she once said &quot;it would be indiscreet to share it with Guardian readers&quot;). Or perhaps you&apos;re simply curious about what her saxophone playing is like these days. Whatever it is, ask away! Imogen will be arriving (London traffic allowing) to go live on the site at 1.30pm BST on Wednesday 3 April, and will be here for about 45 minutes. So get in early and post your questions below, then come back tomorrow lunchtime to follow the action. We&apos;ve posted the questions and answers here to make it easier to follow: alanwskinner asks: I have to play fan for a moment. I first saw you on stage at the Haymarket in Shaw&apos;s own Cherry Orchard, Heartbreak House with Paul Scofield, Vanessa Redgrave and Felicity Kendall. Great performances from you and the other cast members. The balance of the plays you&apos;ve been in seems to favour classic drama. Is this deliberate? Do you feel more in tune with that than, say, the plays of Caryl Churchill or even David Hare? And only one Pinter, I think, and no Stoppard - though I think you&apos;d be perfect for the role of Dorothy in Jumpers, or Hannah Jarvis in Arcadia. ImogenStubbs answers: You&apos;re right, I do love classical theatre. I have done a Stoppard, The Real Thing on the radio, and the workshop of The Coast of Utopia, and I decided not to do the play at the NT because I didn&apos;t want to take my clothes off! I&apos;d love to do more Stoppard, glad you saw Heartbreak House, was so lucky to be working with such great actors, and to be be there when Vanessa Redgrave fascinatingly chose to black up as Hesione Hushabye! sjpf asks: Hi Imogen, Rumour has it that your new play is comedy but is also about the big C. what drew you to the part? and how do you find it balancing both comedy and tragedy? ImogenStubbs answers: Third Finger Left Hand is about cancer, but it&apos;s also about lots of other things. I love trying to balance comedy and tragedy, that&apos;s partly what drew me to the part, but also wanting to take on a role that frightens me. It is very different from my obvious self, and that makes it both a challenge and very intimidating. Also it&apos;s a two-hander, and Amanda Daniels is a fabulous actress! DominicVulliamy asks: Hi Imogen, As a big fan of both your work, and the work of the Royal Exchange, what is it about the Theatre space/company that appeals to you as an actress, and would you consider a return to the space? ImogenStubbs answers: I love the Royal Exchange; it&apos;s a tremendously intimate space with a wonderfully loyal and exciting audience. I would happily go back there, especially if they wouldn&apos;t mind rehearsing in London ... Snotfairy asks: Loved you in Trevor Nunn&apos;s &apos;Twelfth Night&apos;You looked as though you were enjoying yourself as &apos;Cesario&apos; in a tongue in cheek kind of way, was it as much fun as it looked? ImogenStubbs answers: I love your name. Sounds like the bolshy fairy you want to play in Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream ... I did enjoy playing a boy in Twelfth Night (a sort-of boy). But to be honest I was between four and seven months pregnant during the shoot, which made playing a boy and a twin something of a challenge ... JenniferL1952 asks: Saw you in Orpheus Descending and loved it. I&apos;m really hoping to get to Third Finger, Left Hand too. How does your character in this play compare to previous people you&apos;ve played? ImogenStubbs answers: We play lots of different characters in Third Finger Left Hand; usually I only get to play one, and I&apos;m playing someone tougher and from a very different background from me, and in an outfit that I wouldn&apos;t be seen dead in (the tank top and kilt look is great if you&apos;re 17, or Jennifer Aniston, who looks good in anything). Onlinepixie asks: What draws you to a character? How do you pick your roles? Is there a particular role you&apos;ve yet to play but would like to? And how does one cope with the emotional demands of roles like St Joan? ImogenStubbs answers: are you related to Snotfairy ...? Picking roles -- recently I&apos;ve been choosing roles that I hope are very different, slightly out of fear that I have a small, loyal audience and I&apos;m terrified of boring them with the same old stuff. I&apos;ve played Welsh, Italian, bereaved, cynical, and now I get to dance to Northern Soul. selfishjean asks: Ah, yes, that Twelfth Night : I usually hate heavily cut Shakepeare films, but the atmosphere of pleasure and intelligence in that one was irresistible.A silly question, probably. A few years ago you gamely returned to Oxford to appear in a &apos;revival&apos; of a production of Three Sisters from the early 80s, of which I saw the original - and several other OUDS productions involving much the same team. I remember you and Jonathan Cullen, but who else was involved and what happened to them? I&apos;ve been trying to remember for years... ImogenStubbs answers: How lovely you saw Three Sisters. We were all so proud of that. It really was magical, largely thanks to Stephen Pickles, who was the creative team. I still see Jonathan Cullen, in fact we did Little Eyolf together last year. Jenny Walderman is devastatingly impressive in the arts, and everyone else is doing wonderfully. I&apos;ve never since been in a production where people didn&apos;t clap at the end because it was so sad. (I&apos;ve been in productions where people barely clapped, for other reasons ...) adriansmole asks: What was it like transitioning from an academic environment like Oxford to one like RADA? Were there many surprising similarities, or disparities? And you may tire of hearing it, but your Viola/Cesario in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; was really great - - - spontaneous with the speech and totally convincing as a young, nervous but charismatic adolescent boy. It&apos;s a fun movie, and one that I loved growing up - - - the story is able to maintain its farcicality while being filmed and performed in a more natural, plausible style. Thanks for all your great work! ImogenStubbs answers: It&apos;s hard moving from academia to acting, because to act well you need to really listen to instinct, and that can be knocked on head by your critical, analysing mind. I had done a lot of revue shows at Oxford, and was hoping to become Emma Thompson. Somehow I ended up being cast as simpering blonde girls who cry a lot. PabloLuis asks: Why i haven&apos;t seen enough of you in the cinema screens ImogenStubbs answers: I&apos;ve always been very shy in front of a camera. I like rehearsing, and I like the distance of an audience. I think when I have done stuff on screen, my self-consciousness shows, especially if I don&apos;t think the scripts are any good. Then it looks as though I have &quot;I&apos;m really sorry for the unutterable bilge that&apos;s coming out of my mouth&quot; taped across my forehead. alwhit asks: I&apos;m sorry.I just want to talk to you.But I don&apos;t know how to break the ice.I thought humour might help.But I was wrong.Sorry.Do you have any amusing theatrical anecdotes? ImogenStubbs answers: anecdotes. It&apos;s not a funny anecdote, but when we first did Two Noble Kinsmen to a privileged audience of patrons, by the end of what had been a total car-crash of a performance, there wasn&apos;t a single member of the audience left. I think it was 1.07am ... It was before the theatre was complete, and no one could find their way on or off, and three people fell off the stage. People kept shouting: &quot;Barry!&quot;, who was the director. Which isn&apos;t one of the lines in the script. TravellingFay asks: Imogen, you seem like a lovely woman, and you&apos;re a fiercely talented actor. If you&apos;re ever in Bangkok, I&apos;d love to buy you afternoon tea or a mojito. In the meanwhile, I was wondering, all things being equal, which Shakespearean role you most covet? (In that lovely abstract world where you could be cast as ANYONE, regardless of gender, age, ethnicity &amp; all that jazz.) ImogenStubbs answers: I&apos;m there next week! (Sorry, that&apos;s not quite true.) But if I am there, please buy me at least a mojito. Covetable roles: Richard II says some fabulous things, as does Henry V. I&apos;d love to play Juliet again, and I&apos;d love to play Portia in Merchant of Venice. I turned down most of these roles when I was the right age, in the hope of doing something trendier than Shakespeare. I&apos;m an idiot. Dartnall asks: Thinking of plays like The Duchess of Malfi, is it sometimes hard to resist the sheer beauty of the lines and remain in character? Do you have to distance yourself from the beauty or does embracing it help authenticity? ImogenStubbs answers: It&apos;s good to embrace the beauty of the lines. To be honest the Duchess of Malfi is bonkers as a play, and she herself is the lady mayoress of bonkersville. That&apos;s the hardest part, the madness, and to speak the beautiful lines at the same time. It&apos;s not a play where you can forget your lines (as happened to me one night -- I challenge anyone to make up a speech in the right style). BrightonClaire asks: Do you prefer the relatively fleeting nature of a theatrical performance and the chance to adjust it compared to the &apos;set in stone&apos; nature of film and tv? ImogenStubbs answers: Yes, I do enjoy live performance. It&apos;s so out of your hands, TV and film, that if it&apos;s good it tends to be thanks to someone else. And if it&apos;s bad it&apos;s your face up there. I&apos;m going to have to dash, sorry -- thank you so much for all your questions. Please come and see the show if you&apos;re in London! Even if you hate the show, you may get to see James McAvoy, who&apos;s in the theatre at the same time ...

Starring Gosling as an exiled American running a Bangkok boxing club as a front for a drug business, the film has been described by its star as &quot;much more extreme&quot; than its predecessor, which won Refn the best director prize at Cannes 2011 and went on to be one of the year&apos;s best-reviewed genre films. Drive was noted for the juxtaposition of Gosling&apos;s insouciant delivery with Winding Refn&apos;s penchant for stylish ultra-violence and the follow-up has a similar look. The trailer sees the Canadian actor coolly wandering through Lynchian corridors, burlesque hotel rooms, sleazy bars and sumptuous restaurants, pausing to mete out some pugilistic justice from time to time. He utters but two words: &quot;Wanna fight?&quot; Meanwhile Kristin Scott Thomas, who plays Gosling&apos;s &quot;merciless and terrifying mafia godmother&quot; mum, provides the voiceover. She tells her son he was always &quot;different&quot; and &quot;strange&quot;, even during her pregnancy. &quot;They wanted me to terminate, but I wouldn&apos;t. I don&apos;t understand you, and I never will.&quot; The arrival of the trailer will provide solace for fans struggling to cope with Gosling&apos;s recent announcement that he plans a break from acting. The Oscar nominee, who recently signed up to make his debut as a director on the dark fantasy How to Catch a Monster, said last month that he needed to step away from his current profession for the sake of his own artistic equilibrium. &quot;I&apos;ve lost perspective on what I&apos;m doing,&quot; he told the Associated Press. &quot;I think it&apos;s good for me to take a break and reassess why I&apos;m doing it and how I&apos;m doing it. And I think this is probably a good way to learn about that. I need a break from myself as much as I imagine the audience does.&quot; Only God Forgives is being tipped by the Hollywood Reporter to return Winding Refn and Gosling to Cannes, where Drive won so much praise two years ago. Other films rumoured to be gracing the Croisette include Joel and Ethan Coen&apos;s Inside Llewyn Davis, Steven Soderbergh&apos;s Liberace biopic Behind the Candelabra (despite the HBO-funded film debuting on the small screen), Sofia Coppola&apos;s The Bling Ring and Asghar Farhadi&apos;s French language drama The Past. Outside bets are Alexander Payne drama Nebraska and JC Chandor&apos;s All is Lost, which stars Robert Redford. Also mentioned as potential fodder for this year&apos;s festival are James Gray&apos;s Lowlife, Guillaume Canet&apos;s Blood Ties, Jim Jarmusch&apos;s Only Lovers Left Alive and Jonathan Glazer&apos;s Under the Skin.

Sadly, forecasters say we have another fairly grim week ahead before things pick up again. If this feels like it&apos;s too little, too late, don&apos;t despair. On a brighter note, there are deals out there that will help you overcome your vitamin D deficiency. Here&apos;s our pick of 10 of the best escapes over the next month. Morocco  In Mirleft, a coastal village south of Agadir and 30km or so from the pleasant seaside town of Sidi Ifni, the temperature this week will average 23C. Attracting visitors in search of peace and quiet and excellent beaches, the village is a dusty and slightly bohemian place, with a few simple restaurants and cafes. The Kasbah Tabelkoukt is a stylish guesthouse, just south of the village on a cliff overlooking (and with direct access to) a wild, secluded beach where you can surf. The hotel is decorated in an African style and has a small spa, plus rooms in a main house (the &quot;Kasbah&quot;) and some stone cottages set amid gardens. Rooms cost \u00a385 per night B&amp;B for a stay of four nights, an exclusive offer available from Epic Morocco (epicmorocco.co.uk, 020 8150 6131). Fly to Agadir, a 1.5hr drive away, with easyJet for \u00a3193 return, departing on April 23. Pelion peninsula, Greece The Pelion peninsula on mainland Greece is where forested mountains plunge into clear blue sea; inland sleepy mountain villages, little changed in centuries, are said to be among the most beautiful in the country. Go at the end of April when temperatures should be around 20C-24C and you&apos;ll catch the Greek Easter celebrations. The most important celebration in the Greek Orthodox calendar is marked with street processions and fireworks. Ionian &amp; Aegean Holidays is offering seven nights in a small off-the-beaten-track hotel, set among olive trees and overlooking the Pagasitic Gulf, from \u00a3402pp B&amp;B, a saving of 35%, departing on 3 May. The price includes flights from Gatwick (or Manchester for a supplement of \u00a325 per person) and transfers. Mykonos, Greece If you prefer more of a buzz, this deal to Mykonos could be the ticket. Travelzoo (travelzoo.com) is offering a week at the luxury, adults-only Pietra e Mare Beach Hotel, from \u00a3399pp, a saving of \u00a3350 on the original price. Available on selected dates during May and June, the price includes return flights from Gatwick, Luton or Manchester; seven nights&apos; B&amp;B; a welcome drink and food on arrival. Must book by 16 April. Southern Spain     Conil de la Frontera, Spain. Photograph: Alamy    The rain&apos;s been a pain in Spain lately but, in the south at least, it is expected to brighten up from this week. Go Learn To (golearnto.com) has reduced the price of its week-long surf and yoga holiday, from \u00a3331 to \u00a3216. Based in Conil de la Frontera on the Costa de la Luz, the trip includes daily surf lessons and three yoga classes. Price is based on two sharing and doesn&apos;t include flights. For arrival between 21 and 28 April, when the temperature is forecast to be up in the early 20s, you can fly to nearby Jerez from Stansted from \u00a387 return with Ryanair (Ryanair.com). Sicily How about swapping hot porridge in the morning for an Italian breakfast in a Sicilian garden, featuring homemade crostata di mele (apple tart)? It&apos;s indulgent but you can burn off some of those extra calories with a walk along the white marlstone cliffs in the island&apos;s southern region of Scala Dei Turchi, which translates as Stairway of the Turks. La Bianca Scogliera (realmonte-bb.it +39 09 2281 4554) is a homely, cliff-top B&amp;B in the area, with rooms at \u00a342 per night and plenty of home cooking by your host, Signora Graziella. EasyJet (easyjet.com) has flights from Gatwick to Palermo, in the island&apos;s north-west, from \u00a3107 return this month. Anguilla, Caribbean While it has its share of luxury hotels, sleepy Anguilla has escaped much of the development that has blighted some of the Caribbean. Even while staying in a slick and stylish resort, such as the Viceroy, it&apos;s easy to dip into the island&apos;s local culture, finding cold beers, reggae beats and gatherings around smoky barbecues. Virgin Holidays and Hip Hotels are offering five nights in Anguilla from \u00a31,299pp \u2013 saving up to \u00a3280pp \u2013 including flights from Gatwick, transfers and B&amp;B accommodation. Prices are based on select departures from 13 April to 30 June, and must be booked by 15 April (vhiphotels.co.uk, 0844 573 2460). Malaysia More tropical beaches ... this time the powder-white sands of Malaysia. The Andaman resort on the tropical island of Langkawi sits between rainforest and coral reef and offers an array of activities, including bird watching, kayaking, swimming and jungle trekking, guided eco-trails, plus there&apos;s a spa to unwind in afterwards. Trailfinders is currently offering a seven-night stay for \u00a31,249pp (originally \u00a31,749), including flights from Heathrow and transfers, for departures between 15 April and 30 May (trailfinders.com, 020 7368 1200). Brazil     Bossa in Rio, a 'boutique hostel' within easy reach of the beach    Prices of flights to Brazil \u2013 or, indeed, anywhere in South America \u2013 are usually pretty steep. But Portuguese airline TAP is currently offering flights from Heathrow or Gatwick to Rio, via Lisbon or Porto, from \u00a3526, including taxes. The sale \u2013 which runs until 15 April for travel until 31 May \u2013 covers Rio (\u00a3526), S\u00e3o Paulo (\u00a3546), Salvador (\u00a3546) and Recife (\u00a3661), including taxes and surcharges. Hotels can be pricey, too, so save some cash by booking into Bossa, a smart hostel in an old mansion within the atmospheric and boho neighbourhood of Santa Teresa, which is all winding streets, art galleries and independent cafes. At the end of April the larger dorms start from \u00a312pp, but there are private rooms too. A week in a junior suite from 27 April costs around \u00a357 per night, based on two sharing. South-east Asia Malaysia Airlines (malaysiaairlines.com, 0871 423 9090) is offering savings on flights to south-east Asia for bookings made by 19 April for travel up until 31 May. Return economy fares from Heathrow cost from \u00a3579 to Phuket, Manila and Ho Chi Minh City; from \u00a3589 to Bangkok and Singapore; and from \u00a3599 to Kuala Lumpur, saving up to \u00a3300 on the usual fares. In Thailand, an hour or so north of Phuket, on the Andaman Sea, Kantary Beach (kantarycollection.com, +66 7658 4700, rooms from \u00a340) is one of the best resorts. The contemporary designer rooms are massive \u2013 each comes with separate living area, sofa bed, mini-kitchen and balcony \u2013 and the 11km of palm-fringed beach means plenty of space for you to find the perfect spot to sate your need for tropical heat. Florida Skyscanner.net has deals to Florida from \u00a3279, including return flights from Gatwick to Orlando Sanford with Thomson Airways for travel in mid April. East of Orlando, Florida&apos;s Space Coast stretches for 72 miles along the Atlantic. It&apos;s home to the Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral, but it also boasts some of Florida&apos;s best surfing beaches. The closest to Orlando (an hour&apos;s drive) is Cocoa Beach, where you&apos;ll find Surf Studio Beach Resort (surf-studio.com, +1 321 783 7100, rooms from \u00a370), a popular family-owned motel with a 125ft sun deck, where you can hear the crash of the Atlantic waves.", "publicationDate": "2013-04-08T12:02:27Z", "tags": ["Late offers", "Travel", "Morocco holidays", "Africa holidays", "Italy holidays", "Europe holidays", "Sicily holidays", "Greece holidays", "Brazil holidays", "South America holidays", "Caribbean holidays", "Florida holidays", "Malaysia holidays"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/apr/08/last-minute-sunny-holiday-escapes", "title": "10 beach holiday deals: escape to the sun", "sentences": ["Return economy fares from Heathrow cost from \u00a3579 to Phuket, Manila and Ho Chi Minh City; from \u00a3589 to Bangkok and Singapore; and from \u00a3599 to Kuala Lumpur, saving up to \u00a3300 on the usual fares."]}, {"article": "The seaside road was throttled by traffic heading towards Dog Temple, and cars were parked for several kilometres along the coastal highway. Unlike most shrines, where deities are worshipped during the day, worshipping ghosts is best done after midnight, when they are more likely to respond positively. At midnight, tough guys who had rolled up in their Mercedes and BMWs, sauntered to the altar to pray on their knees. Young women in miniskirts and low-cut blouses, accompanied by bodyguards in leather jackets, placed incense in sacrificial urns and mumbled prayers, perhaps against the risks of their profession. The old prayed for the return of lovers long gone over the seas. It was 1988, and I&apos;d learned that a federal grand jury indictment had been issued against me, and the US was seeking my extradition on the grounds of my being the ringleader of the biggest cannabis smuggling organisation in the world. I&apos;d never been to Taiwan, but I headed straight there. No one had ever been extradited from there to anywhere. I&apos;d be safe. My first few days confirmed my optimism. I loved the place \u2013 there was no evidence of any law or regulation. Scooters and motorbikes carrying several passengers with no crash helmets careered through streets with no traffic signals and parked wherever they wished. Forgery was a respected profession. But I missed my kids desperately and kept thinking I should go home and wriggle out of the problem. I heard tell of a Buddhist shrine \u2013 the Temple of the 18 Kings \u2013 patronised by lawbreakers seeking advice on criminal matters. I took a taxi there to resolve my quandary, and the driver explained that during the late 1800s, a boat carrying 17 fishermen and their communal dog capsized in the Taiwan Strait. The fishermen drowned, but the dog survived. In accordance with tradition, the locals prepared a collective grave and ghost temple on a cliff overlooking the shore. The dog jumped into the grave with the bodies, refused to leave, was buried alive, and became the 18th of the kings of the temple. Eighteen is the number of hells in Chinese folk religion. The temple was shrouded in safety, mystery, and danger.     Feeling hounded \u2026 Howard Marks and his daughter Amber visit the Dog Temple    Thick clouds of eye-stinging incense swirled around the temple&apos;s red columns. Altar candles burned in honour of a dog that signified luck and good fortune as well as loyalty and friendship. Worshippers lit cigarettes instead of incense sticks, symbolising the friendship between dog-spirit and man. They stroked and rubbed images of the dog. I made an offering of cash, cigars, and a Cartier lighter, bought a charm necklace, and asked the dog should I stay or should I go. The monk in charge gave me one of 64 possible answer slips. The taxi driver translated: I had to go home. A few days later, I was in Madrid&apos;s terrorist prison trying to avoid extradition. I failed and spent the first few years of my possible 40-year incarceration vowing that should I ever get released, I would go back to Taiwan and kick that dog up its arse. Now, more than 24 years later, my daughter, Amber, was accompanying me there. During the journey, I had scoured travel guides and brochures offering bungee jumping, trekking, shopping, fishing, cookery lessons, health spas and monasteries. But I know, through my decades of travelling, that the benefits of any action vacation become distant memories once you&apos;re back at work. Even worse are anti-vacations, with lean vegetarian diets, meditation, chanting and 5am alarm calls, where drinking alcohol is discouraged. I find such holidays vexing, mind-draining, and expensive. I would settle my score with the dog, eat and drink. We checked-in to Hotel Quote in the centre of the capital, Taipei, an extremely efficiently run boutique hotel that was a finalist last year in the coveted Taipei&apos;s Best Hotel Bar after Dark award. Dawn broke after what seemed like a few minutes, and I caught a fleeting glance of Amber tip-toeing out of the room. She was off to Sun Moon Lake, about 250km away in the centre of the country, for some peace and tranquillity. I fell back asleep and missed breakfast by at least eight hours. Amber had left a note asking me not to go to the Dog Temple until she returned. As night fell, I took a taxi to the nearby Combat Zone, the only night-life area I remembered from my first visit. Almost identical to Bangkok&apos;s Patpong, the zone was a neon-lit concentration camp of more than 50 girlie bars and strip joints in a grid of small streets behind the Imperial Hotel. The zone got its start during the Vietnam war, when American soldiers partied there on their way to and from the killing fields.     Nightlife in Taipei's Yongkang Street. Photograph: Justin Guariglia/Corbis    Its boozy legacy survived, but it had aged considerably, and the tired no\u2011smoking bars and clientele lacked their previous libidinous lustre. I had a few interesting chats with some veterans who had never had any reason to go back home, while the wind picked up, howling like a flock of owls, and the pitch-black sky emptied. It was typhoon season, and one was hovering off the coast, threatening to visit. I, too, was feeling my age, and went back to the hotel to carry on sleeping off my jetlag. At breakfast the next morning, I met an American, David Frazier, who wrote for the Taipei Times. He was an endless source of information on all Taiwanese matters, knew of the Dog Temple, but had never visited it. He offered to drive us there. Daytime is never the most appropriate period to communicate with ghosts anywhere, so Amber and I were not surprised to find the Dog Temple, which I instantly recognised, almost deserted. But I was astonished to see that the temple lay next to Taiwan&apos;s first nuclear power station. David explained that the power station enclosure had been designed originally to encompass the area of the sacred tomb, but the heavy machinery broke down whenever it neared the shrine. The engineers had to abandon their original plan and the nuclear station&apos;s outer wall simply borders the tomb. This helped transform the hitherto local cult into an island-wide craze. The shrine became a focal point for successful anti-nuclear demonstrations, eventually becoming one of Taiwan&apos;s most popular temples. The cult of the dog in the 18\u00a0Kings temple is paradigmatic of the coexistence of tradition and modernity in Taiwan. The power generated by a nuclear reactor could not diminish that of a dog worshipped in a nearby temple. On the contrary, the reactor itself was incorporated into the legends\u00a0celebrating the dog-spirit, and\u00a0the modern media spread the legends throughout the island. There were simply too many visitors to cast them all as underworld types: many were simply ordinary people unconcerned about issues of morality. Bus and taxi drivers suspend temple amulets from their rear-view mirrors and place small statues of the robed dog-spirit on their dashboards. But the carnival atmosphere for which this seaside temple was so famous had inexplicably faded. It looked a bit shabby, with just two food vendors in front selling unappetising bamboo-leaf-wrapped rice and meat dumplings, braised stuffed snails, and some worryingly unrecognisable roasted animal parts. However, a pack of stray dogs loitered knowingly. Shaking with the trepidation of uncertainty, we walked slowly into the shrine. The six-foot high grey stone dog that had haunted me during my years of solitary confinement was no longer there. It had been replaced by two smaller bronze dogs, each baring their teeth savagely. I had already more or less decided not to give the big dog a hefty kick and fool around with a humbling power I did not understand, and in any event, the smaller dogs&apos; arses were inaccessible. Their ferocious mouths turned into loving smiles. I put my right hand into one of their mouths. I was here, alive, healthy, and with my wonderful daughter. I could not imagine being happier. Behind the altar, David and I climbed a hidden stairwell to a small, dark room above the temple, where we discovered a cabinet with 64 small draws, each containing a pile of small pink paper slips bearing a fortune. David, fluent in Mandarin, searched through the 64 different possible answers the dog spirit could give. One stated: &quot;Travellers will find benefit in returning home. If burdened by legal affairs, settle them peaceably.&quot; Clearly, that was the one I had received in 1988. We looked at the pink slip again. Printed in smaller type next to the larger fortune was the following: &quot;This sacred word will bring luck to one of noble heart. But for a scoundrel it will bode ill fortune. Many contradictions are apparent. The return of good fortune cannot be determined.&quot; David burst out laughing: &quot;You obviously didn&apos;t read the fine print, Howard.&quot;Later, at the end of our trip, he phoned me minutes before we boarded the plane to London: &quot;I&apos;ve found out that a second temple has just been built the other side of the nuclear power station.&quot; &quot;Don&apos;t tell me that&apos;s where the six-foot grey dog statue is,&quot; I said. &quot;No. This one is two storeys high. I don&apos;t know how we missed it.&quot;     Taipei has developed a 24-hour a day snacking culture, fed by its numerous street vendors and cafes. Photograph: Justin Guariglia/Corbis    The hotel concierge had suggested I eat at a typically Taiwanese restaurant with the unlikely name of 21\u00a0Goose &amp; Seafood, on\u00a0Jinzou Street, a road that was full of bars and restaurants heaving with rowdy clients. Every table was occupied, but a table for two had a vacant chair to which I was directed. The lone diner stood up, shook my hand, and in stuttering English introduced himself as Li. No smoking signs blazed from every wall, but everyone without exception, including the chefs, was smoking. A betel-nut vendor passed from table to table offering his wares. The set menu was the same each night, first course: goose, second course: seafood. Li and I small-talked for a while as more people crowded into the restaurant and somehow found space. He suggested we go to the bar next door for a drink. The street activity had increased even further when we went outside. Wasn&apos;t Taiwan supposed to be suffering in recession like the rest of us? Over the past few years, I had read several uninviting headlines about unemployment being at an all-time high, economic growth at an all-time low, a severely battered stock market, Sars viruses replacing visiting businessmen, and more bad news. Yet here they were spending money all night, eating jovially, exchanging phone numbers, and drinking with ebullient enthusiasm in crammed bars and restaurants filled with an atmosphere of revelry, intoxication, and fun. &quot;Taipei busier than ever,&quot; said Li, noting my looks of astonishment at the dynamic chaos. &quot;When Taipei people worry, they drink. But rest of Taiwan, bars and restaurants struggling. Sales no good. Places closing, pushing each other out of business with bargain price and happy hour. Even here in Taipei, must sell entertainment, too. Not just booze.&quot; I looked at the four Chinese women dancing on the bar, caught his drift, and nodded over to them. &quot;Like paying that lot to do their thing?&quot; &quot;No. They just office girls having good time. Bar pay for music, lights, smoke vapour, and beautiful girls for customer. Technique simple. Girls surround customer. He buys them drink. They come closer. He buys more. Chinese have special name for feeling of being surrounded by seduction, to be lost in company of beautiful women \u2013 mi huen zhen. Room next door, karaoke. Upstairs different entertainment.&quot; Upstairs housed an open-air smoking area. Several satellite dishes fed enormous plasma screens, showing a\u00a0steady stream of football games, Formula One races, and tap dances to a crowd of foreigners playing table football, pool, and darts. There was no dartboard, just punctured pictures of Karl Marx, and Fidel Castro. The male foreigners were outnumbered by Chinese of both genders looking on in noisy amazement and occasionally throwing a dart and drinking a yard of beer. Peanut shells, dog ends, and sawdust covered the floor. &quot;This new in Taipei,&quot; said Li. &quot;Taiwanese like new.&quot; Another evening, pulling up alongside a heavily populated pavement, we were greeted by immaculately dressed waiters bringing us menu cards to fill in. They would find us when our table was ready. Din Tai Fung is the most famous restaurant in Taipei. There are dozens of cooks looking like surgeons, heaps of bamboo steamers, and great piles of pork and dough rolled and wrapped into its signature dish \u2013 the dumpling \u2013 thin and fresh, never soggy or doughy, and served immediately after it is steamed.     Food for thought \u2026 tucking into dishes at Modern Toilet    The most popular is also the most basic, made with green onion, ginger, pork, soy sauce and sesame oil. The floors and furniture were cleaner than any I have ever experienced, including those of top-end private hospitals and clinics. After taking our seats, we were politely but thoroughly instructed which dumpling went with which sauce and the order in which to eat them. The bright lights helped ensure a quick turnover. One comes here to eat, not for romance. Taipei has an advanced 24-hour snacking culture enabled by street vendors, who will show up wherever people gather, whether at temples or cinemas. Simplicity and freshness are the hallmarks of Taiwanese street food. It&apos;s fresh because the turnover is high, and simple because each stand concentrates on a single dish.Most of the stalls are basic set-ups with a few stools, a generator, a tank of cooking gas, and a grill, pot, or steamer. Although grilled sausages and squid, with their smoke and flame, are the most visible street food, a Taipei night market will also have stands selling fried rice, congee, grilled beef, oyster omelettes, wheat gluten, onion pancake, barbecued pork, roast chestnuts, fresh juice, and dumplings. Some of the street food comes from\u00a0extreme ends of the food chain and looks more like a biology field trip than dinner: entrails, innards, wings, knuckles, feet, tongues and congealed blood are common. Wafting down every alley and byway in Taipei is the\u00a0unmistakable and often appalling odour of stinky tofu, best eaten when smothered in soy, vinegar, garlic and chilli sauce. Most Taipei restaurants, however, no matter how good, are featureless, except for those that concentrate on one feature: Tai\u00a0G, in the Shipai night market, serves just medicinal chicken soup, tailored to the customer&apos;s particular ailment. Jail (37 Dunhua South Road) is decorated like a prison and the waiters dress like inmates. Visitors can put on manacles and have their photo taken in a cell. I gave both of those a miss, but did try Snake Alley \u2013 which is a narrow covered passageway where writhing snakes are skinned alive so that people\u00a0can drink their warm blood while scoffing snake stew \u2013 and Modern Toilet (Lane 50, Xining S Road), which has seats and serving dishes shaped like toilets. The food in each was disgusting. I found the Taiwanese very friendly and relaxed. One can occasionally think Taipei has been far too busy making things to offer anything at all to visitors. But what it does have is genuine, and everything you do see is for the daily lives of the Taiwanese. There is nothing fake for tourists, mainly because there are so few of them. \u2022 The trip was provided by Cox &amp; Kings (0845 154 8941, coxandkings.co.uk).

But it&apos;s not the sole player around. At the end of March Thai audiences flocked to see horror comedy Pee Mak Phrakanong \u2013 based on the Mae Nak folktale about a man who returns from war and unwittingly settles back in with the ghost of his wife, who has died in childbirth. It had the second biggest opening (21.2m baht/\u00a3478,000) ever for a Thai film, and with over 300m baht to date, it is closing on the all-time box-office record (550m baht) held by 2001&apos;s war epic The Legend of Suriyothai. Thai audiences seem to love their history: their domestic all-time top 10 is dominated by it, including Suriyothai, the King Naresuan series \u2013 about to get its fifth instalment \u2013 and the 1999 version of the Mae Nak legend (set in the late 18th/early 19th centuries). But it&apos;s an irreverent take on tradition that has pulled people in for this one. Pee Mak Phrakanong, directed by Banjong Pisanthanakun (also responsible for 2004 global horror hit Shutter), has been transformed from a lovelorn, nostalgic fable to a slick comedy that affectionately teases source material deeply embedded in the Thai collective consciousness. There have been about 30 film adaptations of the story \u2013 including animation, porn and, last year, a 3D version. As well as making the most of photogenic soap stars Mario Maurer and Davika Horne, Pisanthanakun&apos;s version adds copious pop-culture references \u2013 to the likes of The Last Samurai and David Blaine \u2013 and 21st-century snark, making fun of ineffectual monks. It&apos;s that injection of attitude that sets Pee Mak Phrakanong on a nimble contemporary tangent to the country&apos;s history-obsessed box office: it&apos;s easily outpaced second world war love story Khu Kam, another national favourite that has seen multiple adaptations, which was released at the same time. &quot;The reason Pee Mak makes crazy money is because it&apos;s loose and funny,&quot; writes the Bangkok Post&apos;s Kong Rithdee, &quot;and perhaps because it triggers this cool, shallow belief in the star-crossed lovers overcoming the odds set by ideology and death.&quot; The film also seems to be a leap in quality for an industry that has struggled commercially over the last few years and only has a global presence thanks to its arthouse branch, led by Apitchatpong Weerasethakul and Pen-Ek Ratanaruang. &quot;The real good news is that Pee Mak is actually pretty good,&quot; writes Wise Kwai, for Thai newspaper the Nation, &quot;Distinguishing itself from most other Thai horror comedies, this one follows an actual script, which is smartly co-written by the director.&quot; Thailand could make horror comedy \u2013 compared to the more baleful Japanese spookers, or the bloodier Korean variants \u2013 its speciality: Kao Krian, about ghosts scuppering a property developer, and Countdown, by Pee Mak&apos;s youth-focused studio GTH, are just two of the recent films. And it&apos;s a good time to export horror comedy, with a steady flow of it \u2013 especially from the zombie contingent \u2013 having carved out a significant market for it in the last decade. Pee Mak could be too geared to Thai palates to travel all the way around the globe, but judging by a tight south-east Asian release schedule (Indonesia, 5 April; Hong Kong, 16 May; Cambodia, 23 May; Malaysia, 6 June; Singapore, 13 June; Taiwan, 6 August), it fancies its chance in the neighbourhood. So it should: it draws on the vein of wronged-woman folklore that recurs throughout Asia (Ringu drew similarly on Japan&apos;s Yotsuya Kaidan story), and there seems to be a strong appetite for horror in that part of the world. Indonesia is a prolific producer of films with the same fetid perfume of tropical morbidity that underlines the Pee Mak legend; Malaysia has been banging horror films out since a three-decade ban on the genre, for being contrary to Islam, was lifted in 2003. If Pee Mak can secure a release in the massive Chinese market, and stake a claim for the Thai industry, that would be fine news for film diversity in the eastern hemisphere. \u2022 Next week&apos;s After Hollywood will ask whether it&apos;s crunch-time at the Chinese box office for Hollywood.

Shoppers are no longer keen on the large hypermarkets that Tesco has done so much to develop, so it was forced to write off \u00a3804m of property assets and admit that nearly half of its long-famed pipeline of development land was now surplus to requirements. Profits slid 8.3% in the UK last year as Tesco focused on opening its local convenience stores and tried to tempt shoppers back to its biggest outlets with price cuts and investment in warmer, brighter interiors. This year it plans up to 160 new convenience stores and will continue to revamp bigger stores after years of under-investment, partly with the help of eateries such as recent acquisition Giraffe and coffee chain Harris + Hoole. Online The internet is important to Tesco as one of the few areas of retail enjoying rapid growth. Online grocery sales rose 12.8% to \u00a33.2bn last year and Philip Clarke was keen to stress how important a multi-channel presence is for the business. Tesco now has five &quot;dark stores&quot;, where employees assemble customers&apos; online orders, to serve its web business. A sixth opens later this year. However, the non-food website Tesco Direct suffered as sales of electrical products were squeezed by competition from the likes of Amazon, while Clarke admitted that Tesco&apos;s in-store displays of electricals were not up to scratch. Bank Tesco began trialling banks in its stores in 2006 and said it hoped to offer current accounts from 2009. It has since expanded into mortgages, insurance and credit cards, but the current account is not set to arrive until 2014. Meanwhile, revenues at the bank slid 2.2% to \u00a31bn and profits dived 15.1% last year as Tesco took a \u00a3115m hit from PPI mis-selling. Tesco&apos;s overseas ventures China Launched 2004 Number of stores: 131( incl 117 hypermarkets)  Revenues: \u00a31.4bn Three years ago Tesco said it wanted to open 80 shopping mall developments in China by 2016, amounting to 40m sq ft of floorspace- bigger than its UK estate. Today it has just over 10m sq ft and recently announced the closure of five under-performing hypermarkets.Its plan for shopping malls has not proved as popular as it hoped and it aims to &quot;refocus on a more profitable approach&quot; in the country. Still, China remains &quot;strategically important&quot; to Tesco. It opened 12 new hypermarkets last year and will launch online groceries in Shanghai later this year, with ambitions to go to up to 50 cities. India Launched 2008 Number of stores: 0  Revenues: \u00a357m Tesco set up a wholesale business and provides 70% of the products used in the Star Bazaar hypermarket chain owned by the Tata group. It had planned to be in the country when law changes allowed foreign retailers to open up \u2013 but a change in government strategy continues to face delays and the business is tiny. Total sales growth fell back to 25%, in local currency, from 40% last year. Tesco says it wants to &quot;refocus on a more profitable approach to growth&quot; Malaysia Launched 2002 Number of stores: 47 Revenues: \u00a3937m (up 6%) Tesco is Malaysia&apos;s biggest operator with 11% market share via a partnership with local group Sime Darby. It is one of only three countries where Tesco saw underlying sales growth last year (0.5%). South Korea (Homeplus)  Launched 1999 Number of stores: 520 (inc 133 hypermarkets) Revenues: \u00a35.3bn (no growth) Tesco is the second largest grocer in South Korea, its biggest and most successful overseas business. Its Homeplus chain, has proved a hotbed of innovation, developing &apos;virtual&apos; stores which allow shoppers to buy items displayed on subway walls via their phones and cultural centres where locals can take classes in everything from the cello to French. Korea is one of three countries where Tesco plans to focus capital investment, but sales have taken a battering since the South Korean government restricted Sunday trading hours in a bid to protect small stores. Tesco said the new laws cost \u00a3100m of profits last year and expects a \u00a330m-\u00a340m hit this year as restrictions continue. Thailand (Tesco Lotus)  Launched 1998 Number of stores: 1,433 (inc 149 hypermarkets) Revenues: \u00a33.7bn Thailand was Tesco&apos;s fastest growing market in 2012 with sales up 16% in total and 3.1% when the impact of new store openings is stripped out. The supermarket controls 15% of Thailand&apos;s grocery market making it the country&apos;s biggest player. Online groceries launched in Bangkok in February and the company says this is one of three international markets where it will focus international investment. Japan Launched 2003 Number of stores: was 121 \u2013 all now sold One of chief executive Philip Clarke&apos;s first major decisions on starting work was to pull out of Japan where the British grocer had struggled to compete in the notoriously tricky market. Tesco was forced to pay local group Aeon \u00a340m to take its loss-making Japanese business off its hands last year and only managed to finally extract itself earlier this year. Czech Republic Launched 1996 Number of stores: 376 Revenues: \u00a31.35bn Tesco is focusing on the internet and almost halting new store openings. Last year it launched an online grocery service and snapped up the Zabka and Koruna chains three years ago. It has begun reducing the size of its largest stores by renting out space to retailers like C&amp;A and Sports Direct. One of the markets worst affected by the economic crisis with four consecutive quarters of declining GDP. Sales fell back 2% last year or 7%. Still Tesco opened seven hypermarkets there last year, and 40 other shops. Hungary Launched 1995 Number of stores: 216 Revenues: \u00a31.8bn Growth stalled completely last year and profits were held back after the government imposed a crisis spending tax three years ago. It was Tesco&apos;s first international business . The supermarket is now market leader but opened just one new hypermarket last year and plans for more are on hold. Poland Launched 1996 Number of stores: 446 Revenues: \u00a32.2bn Tesco says it has no plans for more hypermarkets and is focusing on expanding its online business. Sales slipped back 4% once the impact of new store openings is stripped out. Poland as a whole saw consumer spending slip back in the fourth quarter. Republic of Ireland Launched 1997 Number of stores: 139 Revenues: \u00a32.4bn Tesco now claims to be Ireland&apos;s leading grocer. No major new stores are planned as consumer spending has been hit by austerity measures. Tesco didn&apos;t open any hypermarkets there last year and only five small stores. Underlying sales slipped back 1% as austerity measures continue to bite. Slovakia Launched 1996 Number of stores: 126 Revenues \u00a31.1bn Slovakia is now home to Tesco&apos;s international clothing division, providing non-food stock to all the supermarket&apos;s central European stores. Tesco says it sees Slovakia as one of its strongest positions. Sales rose 6% last year but underlying sales fell 1%. The country is facing serious economic difficulties and is a small market. Turkey (Kipa) Launched 2003 Number of stores: 191 (inc 56 hypermarkets) Revenues \u00a3745m After 10 years in Europe&apos;s most eastern country, Tesco has been forced to scale back its ambitions dramatically. It has dropped plans to open large stores in the East of the country amid intense cost inflation and tough competition. Total sales rose 13% last year but underlying sales were flat and the business made a loss amid high cost price increases. USA (Fresh &amp; Easy) Launched 2007 Number of stores: 199 Revenues: \u00a3700m Tesco said it wanted 1,000 stores across the west coast of the US when it launched its Californian offshoot in November 2007. It booked a loss of \u00a31.2bn on the business, including trading losses for the current year of \u00a3169m, as Tesco confirmed it was quitting the country.

Their latest collaboration, Only God Forgives, which sees Gosling as a taciturn gangster in Bangkok (and Kristin Scott Thomas as his mother) is the most mainstream entry in the eclectic lineup for this year&apos;s competition. Also rolling onto the grid are new films from the Coen brothers, Alexander Payne, Steven Soderbergh and Roman Polanski. Joel and Ethan Coen present Inside Llewyn Davis, set in the folk scene of 1960s New York, while Soderbergh&apos;s Liberace biopic Behind the Candelabra will also vie for the Palme d&apos;Or. The film, which stars Michael Douglas as the pianist, with Matt Damon as his long-time partner, was rejected for funding by multiple studios before finally finding backing from TV studio HBO. Payne, who took a seven-year hiatus between Sideways and The Descendants, his drama starring George Clooney, released a couple of years ago, returns with Nebraska, a father/son road trip starring Bruce Dern. The other US director in the running is James Gray, whose 1920s set drama The Immigrant stars Joaquin Phoenix and Marion Cotillard. Gray also wrote the screenplay for Blood Ties, a drama starring Cotillard and Mila Kunis, which marks the English-language debut of Guillaume Canet, the director of Tell No One (and the partner of Cotillard). That film plays out of competition, as does the only British film to feature this year: Muhammad Ali&apos;s Greatest Fight, directed by Stephen Frears, about the boxer&apos;s refusal to fight in the Vietnam war and the revenge apparently taken on him by the US government. Ali himself will only be shown in archive footage; Christopher Plummer, Danny Glover and Frank Langella play various senior officials. Also out of competition is JC Chandor&apos;s followup to Margin Call, All Is Lost, with a lead role for Robert Redford. Roman Polanski returns to the festival with two films: Venus in Fur, adapted from an off-Broadway play, which is in competition, and Weekend of a Champion, a previously unseen documentary about Formula One racer Jackie Stewart, which isn&apos;t. Surprise omissions on the list include Rush, Ron Howard&apos;s film set in the world of motor-racing, and either of the upcoming films from Terrence Malick, who won the Palme d&apos;Or two years ago with The Tree of Life. New films from Claire Denis (The Bastards, with Vincent Lindon and Chiara Mastrioanni) and Sofia Coppola (The Bling Ring, with Emma Watson) have been relegated to the Un Certain Regard sidebar, while Cannes perennial Fran\u00e7ois Ozon gets an upgrade to the competition lineup this year with Jeune et jolie, about an upper-class teen who becomes a prostitute. Other films hoping to catch the eye of jury president Steven Spielberg include La grande bellezza from Paolo Sorrentino, Wara no tate by Takashi Miike, Grisgris, directed by Mahamat-Saleh Haroun, and the latest film from Asghar Farhadi, who won the foreign language Oscar two years ago for A Separation. Le Pass\u00e9 stars B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo, Oscar-nominated in 2011 for her role in The Artist.

The Uruguay international has missed only one Premier League game this season, making 43 appearances so far, and will begin preparations for the Confederations Cup once the campaign ends. The eight-team tournament starts in Brazil on 15 June, with the final and third-place play-off on 30 June, leaving Su\u00e1rez little recuperation time before next season should Uruguay progress. Liverpool play A-League side Melbourne Victory on 24 July and have a friendly in Bangkok four days later. A third game on the pre-season tour has yet to be confirmed. Su\u00e1rez could be given four weeks off in the summer, so would miss the tour should it start after the final day of the Confederations Cup. Rodgers has given the Premier League&apos;s leading goalscorer short breaks this season to reduce the risk of fatigue. The manager admits an extended holiday for Su\u00e1rez is a priority after a campaign in which he carried the Liverpool attack almost single-handed until the arrival of Daniel Sturridge in January. Rodgers said: &quot;We are finalising all their dates and when they&apos;re away. They will need blocks of rest. If Luis is playing in that tournament, he may not be back at the start of pre-season for us because he needs to have a recovery period. There will be an individual pattern for every player.

Not Lionel Shriver. Her latest novel, Big Brother, out next month, is about a sister trying to rescue a man who is eating himself to death. Topical? Sure. In the UK, health problems associated with being overweight cost the NHS \u00a35bn a year. But a bit too close to the bone? Shriver&apos;s own &quot;big brother&quot;, Greg, died of obesity-related causes four years ago at the age of 55. Ever since Shriver won the Orange prize for We Need to Talk About Kevin in 2005, her name has been synonymous with brutal honesty in fiction and mesmerising eccentricity in real life. But with her latest one, is this self-examination through fiction taken a step too far? Without any knowledge of Shriver&apos;s own life, Big Brother is an entertaining, gripping, intelligent story. But just before the end, it has an astonishing, jaw-dropping moment when the novelist pulls away the curtains and\u00a0lets\u00a0you see right into something that looks dangerously like her own life.\u00a0It&apos;s a shockingly frank and bold move, one that has already divided early readers. For Shriver, 55, this book surely represents some kind of wish-fulfilment \u00a0in novel form. Shriver says she did not have the chance to &quot;save&quot; her brother. By the time she realised that she could have staged an intervention, it was too late. She wrote of her older brother: &quot;He&apos;s topping 330lb: 24 stone. He was once 5ft 7in tall, but his vertebrae have compressed and, at 5ft 3in, I now look him straight in the eye. I used to look up to him in every sense. I ended our last two visits in tears. My brother breaks my heart. He&apos;s obscenely smart ... but he&apos;s also, sadly, a good test case for the claim that one can be &apos;healthy at every size&apos;.&quot; Within hours of her filing that article in 2009, she learned that her brother had died of cardiac arrest in New York, following a sudden respiratory crisis. But this novel is also something of a mid-career test for Shriver. Her recent novels have had mixed reviews. So Much For That, a story of one family&apos;s struggle with the American healthcare system, was judged preachy. The New Republic, a novel about terrorism written before 9/11 but published many years later, was slammed (&quot;...flails ineffectually, never quite finding a juicy enough target&quot;). But Big Brother, like Kevin, can only serve to fuel the cult of personality that has grown up around Shriver, a figure of fascination whose makeup-free complexion has become the female equivalent of Tom Wolfe&apos;s statement white suit. Shriver is a person of iron will and self-discipline, especially over food, exercise and her daily writing schedule. She let herself go once in the past, she has said, when she was 18. &quot;I basically did the pastry tour of Britain. It&apos;s amazing how much weight you can put on if you just eat cream puffs. That was cautionary: &apos;Oh, I see, you&apos;re not immune.&apos; That has not happened again.&quot; Shriver comes across as bizarre in interviews. She has said that this is because she is female. Male authors are not painted as eccentric. She wears gloves and a coat indoors to save on heating bills. She cycles everywhere, runs nine miles at night, every other day, and performs a series of exercises (&quot;130 press-ups in two sets, 200 side crunches, 500 sit-ups and 3,000 star jumps&quot;). She has coffee for breakfast and then eats nothing until 11pm. She writes standing up. Philip Roth does this too, however, and everyone reads it\u00a0as a mark of genius. And no one teases\u00a0Haruki Murakami about his running. So is she really that weird? Or just a woman? She wears the gloves because she suffers from a circulatory condition called Raynaud&apos;s phenomenon. An ascetic lifestyle seems naturally to feed her writing output. Even her frugality seems born of habit rather than of oddness. Before We Need to Talk about Kevin, she was a struggling, unknown writer who published six novels over a period of three decades, which were more or less completely ignored. Kevin was rejected by 30 publishers. You might be wary about success if that had happened to you. Fans of Shriver \u2013 as a person as well as an author \u2013 love her because she is uncompromising, genuine and refuses to be &quot;nice&quot; for the sake of it. Her detractors find her pretentious, difficult, &quot;self-obsessed&quot;. &quot;This is the other word that follows me, that I&apos;m &apos;scary&apos;. I don&apos;t attempt to be scary,&quot; she once said. A lot of the evaluation of her is, arguably, misogynist: she has been described as having a &quot;mannish intellect&quot;, chastised for not being sufficiently modest about her literary success and made to feel, in her\u00a0own words, that she is &quot;a bitch for not having children&quot;. She has many\u00a0traits that would be seen as laudable in a man: &quot;Whereas if it&apos;s a woman, it&apos;s neurotic.&quot; The thing about Shriver is that she is bold and funny. When describing herself in advance to an interviewer so that she would be recognisable, Shriver told the journalist she would arrive looking &quot;short and badly dressed with dirty blond hair&quot;. She says she is a hermit and &quot;culturally lazy&quot;, but also speaks of a passion for Downton Abbey, Desperate Housewives and Mad Men. Not very many people \u2013 least of all, award-winning American writers \u2013 would publish a novel that is basically about snooker (The Post-Birthday World) and references, as a recurring motif, the 1986 Chas &amp; Dave hit Snooker Loopy, quoting it with relish: &quot;Snooker loopy, nuts are we, we&apos;re all snooker loopy.&quot; Shriver was born and raised in North Carolina. Her father was a Presbyterian minister and, later, a theology professor and president of the Union Theological Seminary in New York. The middle of three children (she also has a surviving younger brother), there were family prayers and Bible readings over dinner. At the age of eight, she decided that she\u00a0did not want to have children of her\u00a0own. When she was 12, she announced she would not be going to church any more. Her father dragged her into the car by her hair. &quot;I have a rebellious streak a mile wide,&quot; she says,\u00a0&quot;and admire people who get away with things.&quot; She changed her birth name Margaret Ann to Lionel when she was 15: &quot;I was a tomboy. I grew up with brothers. So I chose a boy&apos;s name.&quot; She does at least have a sense of humour about this too. &quot;A friend tells me that if I am so perverse as to change my name to Lionel, then I deserve the tedium of having to explain it to everyone I meet.&quot; She has said that it is &quot;moderately true&quot; that &quot;maybe&quot; she wanted to be a boy. &quot;Not because, as British papers have crudely abbreviated, &apos;I thought men lead better lives&apos;, but because I hated wearing dresses as a kid.&quot; She regards it as a point of pride that she has been an American expat since 1985, but she returns to New York every summer. Before settling in London 14 years ago, she spent time in Nairobi, Bangkok and Tel Aviv, before living in Belfast for 12 years. In recent years, she has permitted herself to buy a house in south-east London. (She had previously said that owning a house goes against her frugal nature.) She married Jeff Williams, seven years her senior, in Las Vegas in 2003. He is a jazz drummer, which must have come in handy when she was researching the obese brother in the novel (Big Brother&apos;s Edison is a jazz pianist). Amusingly, Williams&apos;s ex-wife was the agent who used the word &quot;evil&quot; when rejecting We Need to Talk about Kevin. As a protagonist, Kevin was, the agent wrote to Shriver, &quot;one kid from hell who will make people sick just reading about the things he does. Don&apos;t make him a mass murderer.&quot; Shriver was instructed to pay her photocopying bill and rewrite the novel &quot;with a lot more humour&quot;. (Shriver dumped this agent before she met Williams.) One of her greatest joys in life is sitting down to dinner with her husband and shouting at Jeremy Paxman on the television after a long day&apos;s writing. As she recently explained in an interview: &quot;Our idea of celebration is to sit down with our bowl of popcorn and watch Newsnight, and we have a very nice dinner with a bottle of wine and often talk at the table until two in the morning. What more do you want? To me, this is\u00a0great.&quot; Whatever you think of Shriver, perhaps the best thing about her is that\u00a0she\u00a0really doesn&apos;t care. &quot;I have not\u00a0had British or American male authors make any effort to include me in their social circle,&quot; she explained. &quot;I should add that this is hardly keeping me up nights.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-04-20T23:06:11Z", "tags": ["Lionel Shriver", "Fiction", "Books", "UK news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/apr/21/lionel-shriver-profile-big-brother", "title": "Lionel Shriver: time to talk about  her big brother | Observer profile", "sentences": ["Before settling in London 14 years ago, she spent time in Nairobi, Bangkok and Tel Aviv, before living in Belfast for 12 years."]}, {"article": "The claim that two terror suspects in Canada received guidance from &quot;al-Qaida elements&quot; in Iran will give new prominence to a debate among analysts over the exact relationship between the Sunni extremist group and the Shia Muslim state. Claims of links between the two date back to the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and the inclusion of Iran on George Bush&apos;s axis of evil. There is no evidence of any contact between al-Qaida elements and any parts of the opaque and fragmented Iranian security establishment before 2002. The nearest thing is possible meetings between Osama bin Laden and senior figures in the Lebanese Hezbollah organisation, sponsored by Iran, in Sudan in the early 1990s. But as the Taliban regime collapsed in Afghanistan in December 2001, many of the foreign extremists who had been in the country fled west into Iran. Some carried on to Iraq where they organised and led attacks on US forces and, later, Shia Muslims. Others, however, including members of Bin Laden&apos;s close family and veteran militants such as the Egyptian Saif al-Adel, stayed in Iran. It appears to have taken local security forces some time to find and corral the new arrivals. Most appear to have been placed under house arrest, confined to compounds scattered around the country. Quite who was holding them, and why, has never been entirely clear but most analysts believe elements within the hardline Revolutionary Guards took charge of them. Nor was it clear why they were being held. Bargaining chips? An insurance policy? Potential assets? Analysts disagreed. There was little information and much speculation. Occasional arrests of logistics operatives linked to al-Qaida in Iran \u2013 but almost certainly operating illegally \u2013 clarified nothing. Recently there has been more movement. Many of the relatives of militants, including those of Bin Laden, have been released. Some of the senior militants have been freed too, including, it is generally believed, Adel, who may have found his way to Pakistan&apos;s restive tribal areas. But the claim of aid from al-Qaida in Iran for a plot in the west is new. Is the Iranian state likely to have been involved? Canadian police have said there is no indication that the plot was sponsored by the Iranian state, with which Canada severed diplomatic relations last year. Nevertheless, Iran has reacted angrily. &quot;No shred of evidence regarding those who have been arrested and stand accused has been provided,&quot; said a foreign ministry spokesman, Ramin Mehmanparast, according to the Mehr news agency. He said al-Qaida&apos;s beliefs were in no way consistent with those of the Islamic Republic, and that Iran opposed &quot;any kind of violent action that endangers lives&quot;. It is true that Iranian state elements have been convincingly linked to attacks overseas such as in Bangkok, Baku and Delhi last year, and have a history of aiding terrorist organisations. But nothing indicates any working relationship with al-Qaida or its various offshoots. More details may emerge in coming days, but leaping to the conclusion that such a relationship now exists seems premature.", "publicationDate": "2013-04-23T11:36:11Z", "tags": ["Iran", "Al-Qaida", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Canada", "Americas"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/23/iran-al-qaida", "title": "What is the relationship between Iran and al-Qaida?", "sentences": ["It is true that Iranian state elements have been convincingly linked to attacks overseas such as in Bangkok, Baku and Delhi last year, and have a history of aiding terrorist organisations."]}, {"article": "A Thai documentary that examines recent political protests and a border spat with Cambodia has been banned by the country&apos;s government as &quot;a threat to national security and international relations&quot;. Nontawat Numbenchapol&apos;s documentary Boundary zeroes in on a soldier caught up in the 2011 &quot;red shirt&quot; protests that paralysed Bangkok and led to the deaths of almost 100 people, before following him to his hometown on the Thai-Cambodian border. The two countries have long been engaged in a row over the 1,000-year-old Hindu Preah Vihear temple in the D\u00e2ngr\u00eak mountains region, occasionally entering into armed conflict. A series of skirmishes in April 2011 left 18 people dead and thousands of villagers displaced. The area is currently the subject of a UN International Court of Justice probe to decide its future. Numbenchapol&apos;s decision to flag up two of the most contentious flashpoints in his country&apos;s recent history has not gone down well with the Thai authorities, however. On 23 April, the Thai ministry of culture announced a countrywide ban on the film, which premiered at the Berlin film festival in February. Boundary&apos;s director said he was disappointed and surprised by the move. &quot;I really didn&apos;t expect this film to be banned,&quot; Numbenchapol told the Hollywood Reporter. &quot;Everyone I&apos;ve spoken with who&apos;s seen it says the film shows the point of view of every side, and that the film is neutral. My intention was to let the film be a space for the people in the troubled territories to voice their views and feelings to the outside world \u2013 which they haven&apos;t had a chance to express in other Thai media.&quot; A statement from the ministry of culture reads: &quot;The film presents some information on incidents that are still being deliberated by the Thai court and that have not yet been officially concluded.&quot; Few films are banned outright in Thailand, which has no official age-based cinema ratings system. Recent exceptions to that rule have included Palme d&apos;Or winner Apichatpong Weerasethakul&apos;s Syndromes and a Century in 2007, Tanwarin Sukkhapisit&apos;s transexual-themed Insects in the Backyard in 2010 and Ing K&apos;s politically charged Macbeth adaptation Shakespeare Must Die last year. Numbenchapol said he hoped to appeal to the National Film Board over the decision to ban Boundary, but was not holding out much hope of a positive outcome. &quot;Before Boundary, Insects in the Backyard and Shakespeare Must Die were banned, and they both went to the administrative court, but they still haven&apos;t gotten an answer,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it&apos;s useless to appeal, but what else can I do?&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-04-24T11:45:34Z", "tags": ["Documentary", "Apichatpong Weerasethakul", "Film", "Culture", "Protest", "Thailand", "Cambodia", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/24/thailand-bans-documentary-boundary", "title": "Thailand bans documentary about Thai-Cambodia boundary dispute", "sentences": ["Nontawat Numbenchapol&apos;s documentary Boundary zeroes in on a soldier caught up in the 2011 &quot;red shirt&quot; protests that paralysed Bangkok and led to the deaths of almost 100 people, before following him to his hometown on the Thai-Cambodian border."]}, {"article": "It was the Michael Jackson his fans love to remember: a creative genius, a lean, muscular athlete and a doting father. A court case which is expected to shred his reputation took a detour into the positive this week with testimony about the singer&apos;s talent and kindness. A makeup artist and a former dancer depicted Jackson as a hardworking &quot;magical&quot; star who inspired those around him, softening the tone of a trial set to scrutinise his darker side. &quot;He was a gentleman. He was elegant. He was brilliant,&quot; Karen Faye, who did the king of pop&apos;s hair and makeup for nearly 30 years, told a packed Los Angeles superior court on Thursday. &quot;I found myself working with this magical person.&quot; Faye said she had never seen another performer with such energy or drive. &quot;Michael would do five songs to the dancers&apos; one. I never saw anything like it.&quot; On Wednesday Alif Sankey, a dancer and associate producer, said she yearned to recreate Jackson&apos;s magic. &quot;Michael&apos;s imagination was endless. He would visualise it, and it happened. It was amazing \u2026 It was like living a dream of working with an artist like that, and I will treasure it and have it in my memory forever.&quot; The glowing recollections followed grim testimony last week from a police officer and a paramedic who detailed circumstances of Jackson&apos;s death in June 2009 at the age of 50 while preparing for This Is It, a series of comeback shows. His doctor, Conrad Murray, was convicted in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter for giving him the surgical anaesthetic propofol as a sleep aid at his rented home in Los Angeles. Jackson&apos;s family is suing the concert promoter AEG Live for wrongful death on the grounds that it negligently hired Murray and pushed the singer to breaking point. Lawyers for both sides have said they will detail his addiction to drugs. AEG&apos;s legal team warned of &quot;ugly stuff&quot; to come, a reference to revisiting Jackson&apos;s child molestation trial in 2005. In a separate development it emerged that Wade Robson, an Australian choreographer who testified in 2005 that Jackson did not molest him during sleepovers at the singer&apos;s Neverland ranch, now claims he was abused, according to court documents filed on 1 May and reported this week by the Los Angeles Times. Allegations of sex abuse are expected later in the trial, which may last all summer. But this week a sunnier image of Jackson emerged. Faye hugged Jackson&apos;s mother, Katherine, 82, and on occasion joked with Brian Panish, the family&apos;s attorney, as she related the singer&apos;s creativity and popularity. She also recalled the pain and anguish he suffered from two accidents during a 1984 Pepsi advert and a 1999 Munich concert. She told the court about an incident before a concert in Bangkok where Jackson was dazed and stumbling in his dressing room. She told a doctor \u2013 a man she knew as &quot;Dr Forecast&quot; \u2013 he should not go on stage. &quot;I put my arms around Michael and said, &apos;You can&apos;t take him.&apos; &quot; &quot;Forecast replied, &apos;Yes I can,&apos; &quot; she testified. Faye said the man pushed her against a wall and put his hands on her neck, choking her until she couldn&apos;t breathe. &quot;He said, &apos;You don&apos;t know what you&apos;re up against,&apos; &quot; Faye testified. On Wednesday Sankey described Jackson as being indomitable during a 1987 recording of his Smooth Criminal video. &quot;That was my first time as a dancer, as an artist, that I was completely inspired by his craft and inspired by his attention to every detail. He was so detailed and he never missed a thing.&quot; Sankey said his three children would visit him during rehearsals, clearly adoring their father. By the time Jackson was rehearsing for the 2009 comeback tour, however, he was a gaunt, enfeebled figure who said he could hear God&apos;s voice, said Sankey. She and Kenny Ortega, the tour director, were so distressed by his condition during a costume fitting that they cried after he left, she testified. On her way home Sankey stopped her car to call Ortega. &quot;I was screaming into the phone at that point. I said he needs to be put in the hospital now. I kept saying that Michael is dying, he&apos;s dying, he&apos;s leaving us, he needs to be put in a hospital.&quot; Ortega organised an emergency meeting with Jackson, Murray, the physician, and Randy Phillips, the head of AEG Live. In an email after the meeting Phillips wrote of his &quot;immense respect&quot; for Murray. &quot;This doctor is extremely successful (we check everyone out) and does not need this gig, so he (is) totally unbiased and ethical,&quot; Phillips&apos;s email said. The lawsuit claims AEG did not, in fact, investigate Murray, who was in debt and allegedly felt pressured to keep Jackson performing at all costs.", "publicationDate": "2013-05-10T09:06:31Z", "tags": ["Michael Jackson", "US news", "Music", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/10/michael-jackson-magical-aeg-lawsuit", "title": "Michael Jackson praised as 'magical person' in AEG lawsuit", "sentences": ["She told the court about an incident before a concert in Bangkok where Jackson was dazed and stumbling in his dressing room."]}, {"article": "As the British summer falls flat on its face with yet another false start, a new fashion trend is on the rise. The midi-length skirt \u2013 with a hemline which falls below the knee and is most often written off as dowdy \u2013 is on course to be the sleeper fashion hit of the summer. Thanks to an unlikely trio of factors including the blustery weather throughout the spring, Victoria Beckham&apos;s much-photographed personal wardrobe and a glut of hipster pop stars pictured at the Coachella festival, in California the midiskirt is being hailed as the skirt of the season. The shape even scored a red carpet success earlier in the week. Fashion commentators praised the actor Carey Mulligan&apos;s appearance at the Met Ball in New York wearing a midi-length dress by Balenciaga at fashion&apos;s most high-profile event. &quot;The midi is grownup but slightly subversive,&quot; says Katherine Ormerod, senior fashion news and features editor at the magazine Grazia, &quot;and that is a winning combination.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s a length that has been ignored for some time but women are rediscovering it,&quot; says Jane Shepherdson, chief executive of high street fashion retailer Whistles. Retailers across the price spectrum are seeing a steady increase in sales. At the high-end e-tailer net-a-porter.com, sales of the midi length are 10% faster than other skirt shapes. Meanwhile, insiders at the online fashion retailer Asos report that sales of the midi, which is on the front page of the site as a &quot;right now piece&quot;, are up at least 200% on last year. Part of the midi&apos;s success lies in its appeal across the fashion generations. Women in their 20s who are tuned into the celebrity aesthetic of Solange Knowles and Rita Ora are wearing the hemline, as are fortysomething women looking for a more grown-up look for the coming summer. &quot;It&apos;s an elegant length,&quot; says Sarah Curren of mywardrobe.com &quot;I think you would be surprised as to who is buying them. It&apos;s as much twentysomething women as fortysomething women. The younger women see it on Victoria Beckham as her length of choice and for slightly older women it&apos;s a really flattering shape and length.&quot; Fashion commentators agree that the midi trend will outlive the summer. &quot;Fashion at the moment is completely polarised between a hip, street aesthetic, and a minimal ultra-luxe stealth look \u2013 both of which have a place for the midiskirt,&quot; says Ormerod. Shepherdson, in common with many retailers, has a vested interest in the look lasting. In the autumn Whistles will stock a midi-length leather skirt which has already attracted a waiting list of fashion insiders. Who is wearing them? Molly Richards, 21, student     Molly Richards    I got this skirtfrom a stall in Camdenfor \u00a310. Midi length is the only length for ablustery English summer because it doesn&apos;t blow up inthe wind. It&apos;s the perfect length when you don&apos;t want show off too much flesh and when you wear your socks with them you don&apos;t have to flash any leg at all.     Ting Zhi, 21, student     Ting Zhi    I got this from Bangkok. It&apos;s actually a school skirt. I think midi-length skirts are popular because they are really easy to match with anything and much more suited to the freezing British weather.            Aija Koke, 20, student     Aija Koke    I got this dress from H&amp;M. I love that these lengths are in fashion because they are the most flattering cut on figures and can be worn with anything. You don&apos;t feel too body-conscious in them either.              Anastasia Achilleos, 37, facialist     Anastasia Achilleos    I got this dress from Zara last year. I&apos;m glad there are midi-length skirts in all the shops right now because they are so elegant and easy to dress up. You can wear them in the day without feeling overdressed and dress them up for night-time too.         Kuzivakwashe Punungwe-Mutandiro, 23, administrator     Kuzivakwashe Punungwe-Mutandiro    The dress I&apos;m wearing is from Asos. Midi-length dresses are just easier to function in. I think with the whole 60s Mad Men revival there&apos;s a lot of these styles available on the high street. Also, crop tops are in fashion right now and they go really well with midi-length skirts and dresses.", "publicationDate": "2013-05-10T15:15:41Z", "tags": ["Skirts", "Fashion", "Life and style", "UK news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/may/10/midi-skirt-fashion-hit-summer", "title": "Midi skirt is hailed as unexpected fashion hit of summer", "sentences": ["Ting Zhi, 21, student     Ting Zhi    I got this from Bangkok."]}, {"article": "There&apos;s this observation I keep boring other journalists with at the moment. When I went to my first E3 in 2000, magazines were still the dominant format for games coverage. Sure, there were websites emerging, but they were rather limited in scope, and the internet was not yet set up to allow much in the way of multimedia presentation. There were no miniature film crews running about the place with cameras and microphones; there was no Twitter, no 24-hour news agenda. Writers wandered the vast exhibition spaces, playing games, chatting with developers; then we would get home and a few days later file 3000 words on the entire event. It was\u2026 fun.  Everything is different now. Websites like GameSpot and IGN have taken over, pumping out an endless daily quota of news stories, reviews and previews, all looking to satisfy the vast appetites of a global audience. E3 is a panic zone of instant response; journalists litter the hallways bashing barely considered observations onto laptops, then tweeting the results. And every hotel within 30 miles of the LA convention centre is filled with video editors frantically cutting footage into digestible ten-minute reports. Their audiences want to know about games now \u2013 right NOW \u2013 not in a week&apos;s time when the journalist has had chance to think about what he or she has seen. This is an industry of immediate consumption, and news is a commodity that deteriorates at lightning speed.  But forget the issue of turnaround for a second. The biggest thing is video. Five years ago, most of the major game sites were limiting themselves largely to trailers and developer interviews, all spliced in with nuggets of b-roll games footage. But since then the medium has exploded. YouTube has revolutionised video journalism, allowing the fast, easy global distribution \u2013 and crucially monetisation \u2013 of content; and most sites have also developed their own powerful video platforms, allowing them to explore new avenues of content creation. Look at a gaming website today and it&apos;s the video content, not the written word, that leaps out of the front page. While the web continually batters print journalism, video threatens words altogether. &quot;We have a greater focus on video creation than ever before and we are increasingly using video to complement our written coverage,&quot; says Alex Simmons, the UK editor-in-chief at IGN. &quot;We can now cover the same stories as video in a different way that appeals to a broader audience\u2026 Our IGN News videos are increasingly influenced by broadcast news channels, as we aim to bring our audience the news at it happens with rapid turnaround.&quot; For a while, this evolution of games reporting worried me. As a veteran print journalist, I saw not only my own career in jeopardy, but a whole way of thinking about games \u2013 and game reporting. After all, the need to respond instantly and continuously to the news agenda has \u2013 for many industry observers \u2013 tainted broadcast journalism. Nick Davies&apos; book Flat Earth News is a damning indictment of this culture in which depiction is valued over observation and interpretation.  But the thing is, this isn&apos;t really what&apos;s happening, or at least, it&apos;s not the only way that video is being used and presented \u2013 not at IGN, nor anywhere else. &quot;Most of the large sites have dedicated video resources,&quot; says Pat Garratt, editor of VG247, which has made video an integral part of its offering over the last year. &quot;People are now getting more creative in the way they&apos;re approaching video content, trying to find different angles on games in order to make their content work on YouTube. You&apos;re looking for something to go viral, really.&quot; Indeed, increasingly, video is allowing journalists some space to think about and discuss games in interesting ways. Last year, games writer and video maker Matt Lees joined VideoGamer with a remit to create content that challenged the accepted norms of the format. His lengthy video analysis of Bioshock Infinite was one of the most thoughtful and perceptive interrogations of the game I saw.  &quot;That video was a strange one,&quot; he says. &quot;In many ways the structure was identical to a lengthy written article. I planned each point out well in advance, and ordered them in a way that would maintain good pacing and a sensible argument. I&apos;ve always rolled my eyes at lengthy op-ed pieces, but really this was just that in video form. The difference between written pieces and video is YouTube Analytics: 40 percent of people who watched it stayed with the video right up until the end, with the audience retention only dropping below 50 percent at the eight-minute mark. Knowing exactly when people are wandering off gives you much better feedback for the quality of pacing in your work, which is something that long-form written work often lacks.  &quot;What I found fascinating in the aftermath was how few opinion round-ups I read even contained a mention of video as a medium. I wouldn&apos;t call it a stigma, but there&apos;s a definite sense from those within the industry that intelligent analysis is still the reserve of traditional written pieces. Most sites don&apos;t use video in an intelligent way because they&apos;ve become obsessed with churning out regular content. And most professionally created gaming videos don&apos;t rock the boat or ask tough questions, they just provide something that you can briefly gawp at. It&apos;s a throwback to the passive TV generation; a relic of broadcasting that deserves to be obsolete.&quot; But the use of video as a more expressive medium is growing. Gamespot&apos;s Escape From Mount Stupid, Polygon&apos;s Human Angle and OXM&apos;s sublime Breakdowns were name checked by several of the people I spoke to while writing this feature. All of these series&apos; take time to study the culture of games and game development, and all seek to place newsworthy titles and incidents in a wider context \u2013 Breakdown&apos;s look at industry sexism is a masterpiece. Partly, this rise of long form content is about improvements in streaming technology and faster broadband, but it is also about the maturation of the medium. There is a growing understanding that games are of cultural importance and can be considered and explored in the same way as movies and music. As game spaces become more intricate and authentic, they open themselves to new forms of investigation \u2013 hence the lovely PlayStation Access video of reporter Nathan Ditum cycling around LA discovering the real-life locations behind key Grand Theft Auto settings. And with this growing sense of confidence we&apos;re seeing some really engrossing and mature documentary-style pieces appearing. In February, GameSpot UK&apos;s video editor Danny O&apos;Dwyer live streamed about Depression Quest, an interactive fiction game which seeks to help participants understand the condition. There was such a huge response to the piece that O&apos;Dwyer made his own emotionally wrenching video interviewing people who felt that playing games had helped with their own depression. &quot;I felt like being in my position I had a responsibility to highlight the issue,&quot; he explains. &quot;So I got sign off for the project instantly and was interviewing folks within a week. From those interviews the narrative of the video emerged. We have a really creative atmosphere here, so if we have an idea, our Director of Video Chris Beaumont encourages us to dive right in and see what happens. I believe it&apos;s known as &apos;fail fast&apos;. Thankfully those interviews turned out really well. Clare&apos;s in particular. Such an interesting woman, I could edit an entire documentary about her from that one interview alone.&quot; Importantly, video journalism is also beginning to understand and mimic the format of games. When Inside Xbox was dropped by Microsoft last year, co-presenter Dan Maher went on to set up his own production company, Explosive Alan, with the idea of doing games video in new ways. Recently, his team developed Thank You For Playing, an interactive video game show that works almost like an RPG, using linear content as locations within an explorable environment. The technology had to be built from scratch by one coder working from a Bangkok apartment, and has proved a technical nightmare to produce \u2013 but the result is a genuinely relevant and intuitive way of exploring games. It allows viewers to really explore the content, to provide their own parallels.  &quot;If any audience is going to instinctively understand an attempt to add a layer of interaction to a traditionally passive experience, it&apos;s gamers,&quot; says Maher. &quot;We were very keen for whatever we produced to avoid being directly comparable with anything else, and figured the most effective way of doing that wasn&apos;t just to devise great content \u2013 I hate that word, but it&apos;s a convenient catch-all \u2013 but to present it in a way that nobody had seen or thought of before. Judging by the response we&apos;ve received to date, we&apos;ve succeeded on both counts - and that is tremendous relief. We certainly didn&apos;t want the presentation to be perceived as a gimmick, or as something designed to distract from sub-standard videos.&quot; While interrogating Dan about his new video though, the subject inevitably strayed to Inside Xbox, which was hugely influential in its approach to game video \u2013 bringing in charm and great dollops of sardonic wit to its coverage. But Maher says that a major element in its success was the show&apos;s inclusiveness \u2013 the way it took ideas and input from viewers. &quot;It&apos;s easy for a corporation to assume that they know what the audience wants or, worse, don&apos;t actually care in favour of delivering &apos;the message&apos;,&quot; he says. &quot;My favourite mags, sites and, er, Teletext pages were always the ones that had a deep community element - I very rarely got involved personally, but I loved the idea that I could if I wanted.&quot; And here&apos;s the irony. Video is actually doing what old school game magazines used to do so brilliantly: it is creating a sense of community. Through video, sites are able to immediately react to ongoing industry discussions, and they can do it in an amenable and accessible way. &quot;Being light on our feet means some of our best ideas come out of nowhere,&quot; says O&apos;Dwyer. &quot;When Sony live-streamed their PlayStation 4 announcement myself and my colleague Martin Gaston decided to grab the regular stream and commentate over the entire show in the style of Terry Wogan doing the Eurovision. We had a few drinks, played press conference bingo with the viewers and basically just messed about. In the end around 65,000 viewers had tuned in over the two hours.&quot;  A whole range of funny and engaging shows have moved into this area. The likes of Mechagamezilla, Chuckie Dregs and Jontron are talking about games in the same way as we discuss them with our friends - but with even more sex jokes. &quot;Writing for video can completely change the way you think about the game you&apos;ve just played,&quot; says Scott White, co-presenter of the wonderful Bitsocket. &quot;Writing a review for a website, there&apos;s so much more detail you feel the need to pack in, mostly due to the lack of images and space available. Writing a review to be recorded in front of a camera means pouring more of your personality into it. It becomes a discussion between you and the viewer, and when it&apos;s pitched just right, that rapport can build a wee fanbase and help establish your &apos;voice&apos; in further videos. It&apos;s also a far better way to get more than one person&apos;s opinion across, and we&apos;ve found that we love doing joint reviews just for those reasons.&quot;\u00a0  For White, Bitsocket and its contemporaries have the advantage in that they can bring across a sense of personality more easily than the big sites. But the major players are catching up, and devising their own ways of engaging with audiences in more personal ways. IGN, for example, is embracing the concept of user-generated content. &quot;We are championing our All Stars initiative,&quot; says Simmons. &quot;This encourages and rewards readers who contribute expertly generated content on their favourite games, which we then showcase alongside content of our own. We&apos;ve also pioneered the IGN Live format \u2013 a global initiative that streams the biggest exclusive content reveals and major events in gaming, allowing users to voice their opinions with our editors and an audience of fellow enthusiasts around the world as they happen.&quot; And of course, this is vital because YouTube hasn&apos;t just made video distribution more convenient for established news sites, it has also given rise to a new generation of superstar gamers. The likes of Syndicate and Yogscast are now drawing huge global audiences of dedicated gamers \u2013 and they represent merely the tip of a gigantic iceberg that may well sink the traditional media if it doesn&apos;t keep up.  Is that traditional media concerned? &quot;There&apos;s always going to be a place for the expert voice,&quot; argues Simmons. &quot;In the same way as people turn to the BBC for in-depth coverage after reading about breaking news on Twitter, traditional media and online stars will always co-exist.&quot; But then, it&apos;s up to the major sites to create content that really, truly is in-depth. At the moment, that&apos;s more about having better access to content than the YouTube amateurs, but the power ratio is changing. Most publishers now have community representatives who work closely with YouTube stars. When EA held its Battlefield 4 event in Stockholm recently, it didn&apos;t just invite journalists from established media sites, it also had a large contingent of bloggers and YouTube presenters. This is becoming the norm rather than the exception. The outsiders are breaking in \u2013 but they&apos;re still outside enough to occasionally bite the hand that feeds them. And for Lees, making good videos is about maintaining a little distance from the game publishers. Industry giants will always seek to control the dialogue, mostly through the distribution of their own trailers, footage and developer interviews \u2013 all designed to be slotted conveniently into news channels. That stuff has to be employed with caution. &quot;Many of these YouTube superstars have talent, but it feels like a lot of their success is derived from our industry&apos;s failings,&quot; he says. &quot;We talk about games that are being promoted, they talk about games that people actually play. Most media outlets try to tick all of the boxes, while these guys are unashamedly niche - they do what they want, and that&apos;s it.  &quot;There&apos;s a huge amount we can learn from what these guys are doing, but the measures that need to be taken are frightening if you&apos;re running a bigger business. The only way we can compete with talent like this is by giving ourselves an equal footing: They exist outside of the industry, but we have to actively distance ourselves from it.&quot; These issues are only going to become more complex in the next generation era. The PlayStation 4 &apos;Share&apos; function will put videocasting tools into the hands of every gamer, ratcheting up the pressure on the mainstream sites. Meanwhile, the rise of live streaming is opening new avenues to both amateur and professional reporters. Amid all this, there is a growing dichotomy between video reports put together with publisher-approved content, and more investigative or satirical pieces exploring and criticising the industry. Sooner or later, a line will be drawn in the sand: Nintendo&apos;s recent decision to claim ad revenue on user-generated content showing Nintendo game footage reveals that the big publishers are ready to tighten their grip on the medium \u2013 if not yet the message. But what happens when that happens \u2013 when sites start coming into conflict with major companies over fair use of gameplay footage? Written games journalism has recently been through a major period of doubt and self-assessment over its relationships with publishers; it looks like video content may well soon get its turn in the spotlight of media ethics. But I realise that, as an old-timer who once stalked the showfloor of E3 with a notebook and pen rather than a camera and video editing suite, I am of a passing generation. Video reportage isn&apos;t just growing because it&apos;s convenient to watch, it&apos;s growing because it can portray and analyse games in new and innovative ways.  Games are, after all, a visual medium, and they are inclusive. Video journalism taps into these qualities. When I started out in this industry, all I wanted was to be like Julian Rignall, Gary Penn or Stuart Campbell, great writers who managed, through the printed medium, to exert personality and personal affinity with readers; they made their magazines into clubs. It&apos;s the video makers who are doing that now, who are filling that space between viewer and reporter. That is a space in which great entertainment and great journalism occur. And that is why I am wrong to feel nostalgia for the E3 of 2000.  Here&apos;s the thing. The games media industry is different now, but it is not better and it is certainly no worse. The voices have changed, but they are good, interesting and passionate voices. We need to listen \u2013 and to watch. People like Matt and Danny and Scott are forging ahead. I have to face that \u2013 and somehow (God, I don&apos;t know how), I have to keep up.", "publicationDate": "2013-05-17T12:36:00Z", "tags": ["Games", "Media", "Technology", "Game culture", "E3", "Events", "Culture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/may/17/print-is-dead-video-journalism-games", "title": "Writing is history?

Abdel Hakim Belhaj is suing the former foreign secretary Jack Straw and Sir Mark Allen, former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, as well as the British government and its intelligence agencies, over the so-called extraordinary rendition operation from 2004. The high court in London heard on Tuesday that ministers would probably move to have the case heard under the secrecy provisions of the controversial Justice and Security Act, which comes into force in July. &quot;The new act will apply to these proceedings,&quot; Rory Phillips QC, representing the government, told the court at a preliminary hearing. &quot;It is likely that such an application will be made.&quot;     Jack Straw, former foreign secretary, faces damages claims. Photograph: Andy Hall    The act has faced criticism from lawyers and human rights groups who argue that its primary intention is not to protect intelligence-sharing arrangements with foreign states \u2013 as ministers argued when it was passing through parliament \u2013 but to conceal evidence of government wrongdoing in cases such as that brought by Belhaj. Straw, Allen and the government face claims for damages from Belhaj and his wife, Fatima Bouchar, who accuse them of false imprisonment, conspiracy to injure and trespass to person, misfeasance in public office and negligence. Richard Hermer QC, for the couple, predicted that there was &quot;likely to be a lively debate&quot; between the two sides over the circumstances in which the secrecy provisions of the act could be relied upon by the government. Phillips made clear, however, that the defendants were keen to reach a negotiated settlement with Belhaj. &quot;They would be pleased to enter into a settlement process to draw a line under this case,&quot; he said.     Documents in Moussa Koussa's offices. Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex Features    &quot;The defendants would like to reiterate \u2026 their willingness to sit down with Mr Belhaj and his representatives, face to face, in order to see if we can reach a settlement.&quot; Belhaj and Bouchar&apos;s lawyers believe the pair has a strong case, based in part on a secret intelligence file discovered by the New York-based NGO Human Rights Watch during the revolution that toppled Gaddafi. The file contained a number of letters from Allen to the dictator&apos;s intelligence chief, Moussa Koussa, including one in which the MI6 officer made clear that although he did not pay for what he described as &quot;the air cargo&quot;, the intelligence that had led to the couple being detained and &quot;rendered&quot; had originated with his agency. Other documents discovered at the time showed that MI6 was involved in a second operation in which another Libyan dissident, Sami al-Saadi, was kidnapped and flown to Tripoli along with his wife and four children, the youngest a six-year-old girl. Al-Saadi settled his claim against the British government with a payment of \u00a32.2m. Belhaj has offered to settle his claim with a payment of just \u00a31 from each of the defendants, but insists that they must admit their guilt and apologise to him, and particularly to his wife. Despite being visibly pregnant, Bouchar was allegedly chained to a wall when detained by the CIA in Bangkok before being taped head and foot to a stretcher for the 17-hour flight to Tripoli. She was then held for several months while her husband was being interrogated and allegedly tortured nearby. Such an apology is unlikely to be forthcoming, however, as the two UK-Libyan rendition operations are the subject of a Scotland Yard investigation \u2013 one of four police investigations into the activities of British intelligence officers in the years after 9/11. The high court case was adjourned until October, when the government will argue that the case cannot be tried in an English court, as the events took place outside the UK, and involved foreign intelligence officers. Were this to be accepted by the courts, Hermer argued, &quot;then whenever agents of the British state are involved in joint operations with agents of a foreign state, they enjoy complete immunity&quot;. The kidnap, torture and arbitrary detention that the couple suffered were offences not only in English law, but &quot;fundamental breaches of international law&quot;. Straw and Allen are also arguing that they are unable to respond to the allegations because of the restraints of the Official Secrets Act.", "publicationDate": "2013-05-21T19:46:54Z", "tags": ["Jack Straw", "Politics", "MI6", "UK news", "Human rights", "Law", "Torture", "Official Secrets Act", "Libya", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa", "Muammar Gaddafi", "Rendition", "World news", "Abdel Hakim Belhaj"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/21/abdel-hakim-belhaj-torture-secret-court", "title": "Abdel Hakim Belhaj torture case may be heard in secret court", "sentences": ["Despite being visibly pregnant, Bouchar was allegedly chained to a wall when detained by the CIA in Bangkok before being taped head and foot to a stretcher for the 17-hour flight to Tripoli."]}, {"article": "     It may not win the Palme D&apos;Or, but it could win the Walkout D&apos;Or, a gold trophy of a cinema-seat banged up into the upright position. Nicolas Winding Refn&apos;s Only God Forgives is a glitteringly strange, mesmeric and mad film set among American criminal expatriates in Bangkok. It is ultraviolent, creepy and scary, an enriched-uranium cake of pulp, with a neon sheen. The first scenes made me think that Wong Kar-wai had made a new film called In the Mood for Fear or In the Mood for Hate. Ryan Gosling plays Julian, the co-owner of a Muay Thai boxing club with his brother Billy (Tom Burke): an operation which is a front for selling drugs. Both brothers are naturally angry and violent, though in keeping his feelings in check, Julian is of course by far the more unsettling.            When Billy indulges his taste for violence and misogynist hate one night, and is himself murdered by his victim&apos;s father, Julian realises that he is expected to discharge the gangster&apos;s ultimate responsibility: revenge. But a twinge of conscience, or a twist of pain at the memory of those misdeeds which drove him from America in the first place, won&apos;t let him kill. This inability brings two terrifying people into his life and into the movie: one is Julian&apos;s mother Crystal, played by Kristin Scott Thomas, enraged at Julian&apos;s pathetic disloyalty. The other is the mysterious plainclothes police officer Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm), who roams the streets armed with a sword: a sharia-samurai of justice. It is the impassive Chang who first discovered Billy&apos;s victim and for enigmatic reasons of his own, created the situation in which Julian found himself agonisingly incapable of that payback his mother expects.Chang could be a Zen master, whose vocation is to proselytise for the futility of revenge. He could be that god who insists that vengeance is solely his and only he will repay. Or he could be the ultimate sadist and tyrant, a Machiavel with a telepathic sense of how his victims are to be drawn into his power. Either way, Julian \u2014 clenched and unhappy in the three-piece suit he has put on for a dinner date with his mother, and never takes off \u2014 realises he has to challenge Chang to a fight. The film exerts an eerie and woozy grip from the outset, with many nightmarish scenes of people walking down long, claustrophobic corridors, somehow always pulsing with dark red and green light, like the subway in Gaspar No\u00e9&apos;s Irr\u00e9versible or the tenement corridor in Scorsese&apos;s Taxi Driver. There are some deeply disturbing karaoke club scenes, with crooning songs about unrequited love. (Winding Refn may also have taken something from the British film-maker Thomas Clay, and his Bangkok-set film Soi Cowboy.) Larry Smith&apos;s cinematography, Beth Mickle&apos;s production design, and the art direction by Russell Barnes and Witoon Suanyai are staggeringly good. And however incredible this sounds, Only God Forgives has moments of great subtlety. When Julian has to go for dinner with his mother, he clearly anticipates it will be an occasion in which Crystal will pitilessly humiliate him about his cowardice and the size of his penis. So he brings along as his date the prostitute for whom he is a regular: Ma\u00ef (Yayaying Rhatha Phongam).            Ma\u00ef&apos;s face shows how touched and moved she is when she realises Julian wants him to meet his mother \u2014 and then quietly, deeply wounded when Julian says that they must &quot;pretend to be a couple&quot;. It is only Ma\u00ef who emerges from the dinner, and indeed the movie, with any dignity and self-respect. There is another fascinating touch: when Chang is himself under threat, and must hit back against those tormentors employed by Crystal, he finds himself in what appears to be a cinema storeroom surrounded by reels of film, and will impose his violent authority on the manager, who is there with his boy. It is this boy who makes a strange, almost involuntary gesture with his hand towards his back, and a fraction of a second later we realise what is happening: Chang is about to unsling his sword. For some reason, I thought of the scene from Macbeth in which Banquo is slain in front of his child.            Only God Forgives will, understandably, have people running for the exits, and running for the hills. It is very violent, but Winding Refn&apos;s bizarre infernal creation, an entire created world of fear, really is gripping. Every scene, every frame, is executed with pure formal brilliance.

One American woman exclaimed loudly as she exited: &quot;This is shit.&quot; Even its British co-star, Kristin Scott Thomas, said: &quot;Films where this kind of violence happens I don&apos;t enjoy watching at all&quot; and joked that as the film was made &quot;it got more and more despicable&quot;. But its director, Nicolas Winding Refn, said that he approached filmmaking &quot;like a pornographer: it&apos;s about what arouses me. Certain things turn me on more than other stuff and I can&apos;t suppress that.&quot; He added: &quot;I have surely a fetish for violent emotions and images.&quot; Only God Forgives, which reunites Winding Refn with Drive star Ryan Gosling, is the first great schismatic movie at Cannes, with critics either panning its violence or dazzled by its stylised brilliance \u2013 or else wildly vacillating between the two positions. Challenged on the film&apos;s violence, Winding Refn said: &quot;Well, art is an act of violence. It is about penetration, about speaking to our subconscious and our moods at different levels.&quot; He added: &quot;I don&apos;t consider myself a very violent man \u2026 but I have surely a fetish for violent emotions and images and I just can&apos;t explain where it comes from. But I do believe it&apos;s a way to exorcise various things. Let&apos;s not forget that humans were created very violent: our body parts are created for violence, it is our instinctual need to survive. But over the years we no longer need violence but we still have an urge from when we are born \u2013 which itself can be an act of violence.&quot; Set in a Thai underground world of fight clubs, prostitutes and seedy American crooks, it is a visual feast, with little dialogue and the Wagner-influenced score taking a prominent role \u2013 more in harmony with the director&apos;s earlier, more recherch\u00e9 work than the commercial hit that was Drive. It stars Ryan Gosling as owner of a Bangkok boxing club, and Scott Thomas as his mother. She is a peroxided Clytemnestra of a character \u2013 trashy, American and emphatically nothing like the cut-glass-accented aristocrats she is most famous for playing. She had given such roles a &quot;kick in the teeth&quot; with this part, she said.           At one point she is required to say a deeply offensive and misogynist phrase that Gosling told Winding Refn was &quot;the worst thing you can say to a woman in America&quot;. She struggled with the line (&quot;cum dumpster&quot;). &quot;It took me about eight takes to pronounce the words&quot;, she said. Asked by Winding Refn if she would repeat it there and then, she said, &quot;No.&quot; According to Winding Refn, Scott Thomas &quot;had no problem turning on the bitch witch&quot;. She added: &quot;It wasn&apos;t like I need to find a part that means I can break the terrible shell I have been trapped in: it wasn&apos;t like that at all. It was more organic than that. Every day we would get braver. &quot;When I first read the script I was excited about playing someone far away from the upper-class thing that English people seem to love seeing me in.

The coughing on one side sparks a response in the other and before long everyone appears to be at it and the whole place sounds like New Year&apos;s Eve at the TB sanatorium. I seem to remember the same thing happening last year; it&apos;s like some weird Cannes tradition. By this point of the festival, the delegates are breaking down. Already the first cardboard boxes have appeared in the marche, the first sign that the sellers are packing up and moving on. The Salle Bu\u00f1uel at the top of the Palais is more than half-empty for the late morning screening. It gives the place a morbid air. Logic tells me that these absentees can all be accounted for. They are off riding trains, sitting in departure lounges or securely back in their own feather beds. And yet I can&apos;t shake the sneaking sense that they are really being murdered, one by one, right under my nose. That&apos;s what comes of watching too much Nicolas Winding Refn. Only God Forgives prompts early exits and a chorus of boos. Refn&apos;s film is bloated, corpulent and borderline repulsive \u2013 yet there&apos;s something magnificent about it just the same. Ryan Gosling is Julian, a jittery, oppressed drug dealer at large in Bangkok, while Kristin Scott Thomas co-stars as his profane, blonde-tressed, tragic-eyed mum.

You&apos;d hesitate to describe Only God Forgives as a thriller, exactly. It lacks the hard thrust and steely chassis of Refn and Gosling&apos;s last film, Drive, opting instead for a kind of rolling thunder of ambient violence. Even so, it casts a spell. The director leads us through the Bangkok underworld as though it&apos;s the belly of the beast. The interiors are variously pitch-black and blood-red. The walls are tacky, moist to the touch, while the turbulent electronic soundtrack could be roaring indigestion or whistling gas. Refn&apos;s beast is sick and corroded and all set to die.

First came La Grande Bellezza, Paolo Sorrentino&apos;s swooning fresco of Italian high society, in which an exacting cosmetic surgeon dispenses Botox injections as though he&apos;s offering holy sacrament. Then, not 24 hours later, came the sight of Rob Lowe&apos;s smirking little Frankenstein, resplendent in a Farrah Fawcett hairdo, in Behind the Candelabra. Lowe&apos;s character is tender, wise and knows what is right. He comes to make Matt Damon&apos;s chauffeur into Liberace&apos;s own image. It&apos;s what the man upstairs demands.

A real human being who&apos;ll hesitate and crumble under pressure. Nowhere is this clearer than in the climatic scene of Nicolas Winding Refn&apos;s bloody Bangkok-set thriller, in which tall, handsome Gozzle fights a stumpy, chubby, fiftysomething and loses, horribly. He swings and misses. Turns to find a fist in his face. He doesn&apos;t land a punch, but as the blows rain down and the bruises well up, he still manages to make defeat look sexy. Henry Barnes It&apos;s tough to be rich           Film after film has glittered with diamonds, gilt and rhinestones this Cannes: The Great Gatsby, The Bling Ring, Grande Bellezza, peopled by the decadent, luxurious Roman party set; Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi&apos;s A Castle in Italy, a tale of ennui among the Franco-Italian gentry; and the blissful Liberace biopic Behind the Candelabra, which positively vibrates with fox furs, vintage champagne and stretch limos. These scenarios are so out of sync with the reality of the current economic crisis it&apos;s hard to know what to make of all this cinematic dosh. But, you know what? Not one of the super-rich characters in these films is happy. Doesn&apos;t that make you feel better already? Charlotte\u00a0Higgins Hollywood&apos;s &apos;too gay&apos; threshold is really, really low             &quot;Oh GOD!&quot; screams Michael Douglas as he rolls off Matt Damon in a moment of post-coital ecstasy. The pair \u2013 who play Liberace and his lover, Scott Thorson, in Behind the Candelabra, have been at it for a while \u2013 it&apos;s their fourth time that day, in fact. But we have to take their word for it, because there&apos;s little actual sex in Steven Soderbergh&apos;s film. The director \u2013 who took the film to HBO after it was rejected by the studios \u2013 has said the story was &quot;too gay&quot; for Hollywood. Hollywood, it turns out, is even more prudish than you imagined. Henry Barnes Hotel safes, well, ain&apos;t           Spare a thought for the Chopard employee returning to a reasonably priced Suite Novotel room after a hard day&apos;s jewellerising the rich and famous at Cannes. Perhaps he popped his trousers in the press and ordered a croque monsieur from room service before settling down to idly wonder where all that dust could have come from. And why he can see into the room next door. Through the hole in the wall. The hole in the wall where the safe used to be. The safe that contained a million dollars&apos; worth of jewellery to loan to the rich and famous at Cannes. Time, perhaps, to investigate the minibar. Elliot Smith Tarts with hearts aren&apos;t just on screen           &quot;Hookers stand out at Cannes,&quot; wrote Roger Ebert back in 2010. &quot;They&apos;re the ones who are well-dressed and not smoking.&quot; This year they appear to be standing out more than ever, positioning themselves at millionaire yacht parties and in the lobbies of swish hotels. Cannes, explains an escort quoted by the Hollywood Reporter, is &quot;the biggest pay-day of the year&quot; and some sex workers can reputedly earn nearly $40,000 a night. But the profile has caused concern at this event, drawing attention to the shady satellite industry that accompanies the Cannes high-rollers. &quot;Can anyone explain how the elegant Carlton hotel&apos;s lobby has become hooker central?&quot; tweeted Steven Gaydos, executive editor of Variety, last week. &quot;It&apos;s weird, disconcerting, tacky.&quot; Xan Brooks Novelty pop rocks           Real folkies (and the Coen brothers) will look down on us, but \u2013 for all the beautiful versions of traditional songs played during Inside Llewyn Davis \u2013 we can&apos;t stop singing the corniest of the lot.

All together now \u2026 &quot;Please Mr Kennedy (Uh-oh!)/ Please don&apos;t send me into outer space.&quot; Perhaps the Cheeky Girls deserve a re-analysis? Henry Barnes Dogs die in cool movies           Not a great year to be man&apos;s best friend. Mexican crime thriller Heli saw a cute puppy have its neck snapped by a drug-hungry thug. Fruitvale Station had a staffie bleed out on the road after being hit by a speeding car. Neither fate was as terrible as the pooch who got dog-napped by the shallow kids of The Bling Ring \u2013 Sofia Coppola&apos;s film about a gang of dumb label-slaves who rob the rich to give to themselves. That poor mutt will never walk again. He&apos;ll be stuffed in a handbag and carried to the mall. Sometimes death&apos;s the preferable option. Henry Barnes It&apos;s the year of the cat           This year&apos;s Palme Dog \u2013 awarded to the best canine actor in Cannes \u2013 may need to go to a cat. Ulysses, the moggie in the Coens&apos; Inside Llewyn Davis (in fact &quot;four to six&quot; animals were used, according to Ethan Coen) carries much of the story. &quot;We threw the cat in,&quot; says Joel, who is not, it seems, much of an ailurophile, because the film &quot;didn&apos;t really have a plot&quot;. He adds that the moggie, which summons to mind the ginger cat in Breakfast at Tiffany&apos;s (made in 1961, the year Inside Llewyn Davis is set), was &quot;not easy to direct&quot; and the whole thing was &quot;a pain in the ass&quot;. Fortunately feline film\u00a0stars don&apos;t answer back. Charlotte Higgins Film is dead (ish)           Jane Campion&apos;s six-hour crime telly drama enjoyed a deluxe screening plus Q&amp;A. Alec Baldwin sang the praises of the small screen. HBO backed a slate of premieres, including Stephen Frears&apos;s latest, Muhammad Ali&apos;s Greatest Fight, as well as Soderbergh&apos;s last, final, this-time-he-really-means-it (for now) film Behind the Candelabra. Soderbergh was happy about the US gogglebox premiere, he said, as this way &quot;more people would get to see it&quot;. It&apos;s unfortunate that won&apos;t include Academy voters who might otherwise have been able to spare the film some of their beady-eyed consideration in time for the Oscars.

Only God Forgives!&quot; They might have been members of a doomsday cult, one with an imperious dress code, but no: a Ryan Gosling film was about to premiere in the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lumi\u00e8re and this lot were ticketless, hoping by dressing smartly to pick up last-minute invites. They looked on while several hundred of us filed in for 90 minutes of early-morning ultra-violence. Moviegoing at the festival runs round the clock. There are marquee screenings not long after dawn and teatime premieres; four-hour Holocaust documentaries for supper and Asian gumshoe flicks at midnight. The Gosling film, Only God Forgives, directed by Drive&apos;s Nicolas Winding Refn, made extremely strange breakfast viewing. In the back row an usher discreetly napped while Refn&apos;s tense, brutal movie unfurled. Gosling plays Julian, a taciturn hood who, with his brother Billy (Tom Burke), runs a drugs cartel in Bangkok. Billy, the volatile one, murders a teenage prostitute which brings on the wrath of a local police chief, Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm). Dumpy and balding, a karaoke fiend who dresses in a short-sleeved shirt, Chang makes an unlikely avenger but with a sharp little sword he takes decisive action against the brothers. Further killings bring in Julian&apos;s mother Crystal (played by Kristin Scott Thomas, almost unrecognisable as a gravy-tanned blonde) and then things really get messy. Creative use is made of whisky tumblers, woks, hair pins. I quite enjoyed it. On every newsstand in Cannes there&apos;s a magazine with Gosling on its cover, alongside the headline: L&apos;art du cool. The Canadian actor clearly has it, and in Only God Forgives he&apos;s a magnetic presence \u2013 unblinking, unhurried, outfitted for Refn&apos;s gruesome finale in buttondown shirt and waistcoat, the costume as wonderfully inappropriate as those early-birds wearing bow-ties and high heels outside. However, as Cannes entered its second week, I began to fear for the industry&apos;s wardrobe professionals. The thumbs that must have been twiddling on film sets around the world\u2026 Nakedness has been very big this year. &quot;The nudiest festival I can remember,&quot; said one Cannes regular after a run of screenings including Rebecca Zlotowski&apos;s Grand Central, Alain Guiraudie&apos;s Stranger by the Lake, Fran\u00e7ois Ozon&apos;s Young and Beautiful and Abdellatif Kechiche&apos;s Blue Is the Warmest Colour, the leads in all spending as much time in the buff as not. Even Paolo Sorrentino&apos;s The Great Beauty, about growing old in despair, has its share of skin \u2013 the introduction of a major character via lengthy striptease, for instance. But the Italian director&apos;s surreal, beguiling film has plenty besides to recommend it. We meet Jep (Toni Servillo, who starred in Sorrentino&apos;s 2008 hit Il Divo), a suave Italian novelist who turns 65 and realises he&apos;s wasted his life carousing and party-hopping around high-society Rome. &quot;I didn&apos;t just go to parties,&quot; Jep muses, &quot;I had to have the power to make them a failure.&quot; For all its stranger whimsies (a full-cast opening dance sequence, a CGI giraffe, the unremarked death of a major character), Sorrentino&apos;s script is packed with terrifically precise one-liners. You&apos;re a misogynist, Jep is told, to which he replies that he&apos;s a misanthrope: &quot;Where hate&apos;s involved you must aim high.&quot; Later, at a plastic surgeon&apos;s clinic, a woman trying to lose weight tells her doctor: &quot;I&apos;ve just been to India. I had amazing dysentery.&quot; The bleak humour of plastic surgery \u2013 expensive, hubristic, its results so often cruelly comical \u2013 is embraced by Steven Soderbergh in his satisfying new work, Behind the Candelabra. A biopic about Liberace (played by Michael Douglas), it is for the most part the tale of a relationship in the late 1970s between the pianist, known to his friends as Lee, and long-term boyfriend Scott (Matt Damon). Their money-nourished romance is tender at first then fractious and unhappy. Beneath the love story Soderbergh and his team of make-up artists tell a fascinating visual story about facial reconstruction. And re-reconstruction. And re-re-reconstruction. With the aid of an alcoholic surgeon (Rob Lowe), Lee and Scott work on themselves tirelessly, getting smoother, shinier, sharper and finally so surgery-wrecked that Scott is afraid to show his face to his family. Lee, for a stretch, has to sleep with his eyes open. The two leads are tremendous, and Douglas is the popular choice to win a best actor award at festival&apos;s end. But it&apos;s the sense of invited physical ruin that lingers. It certainly made it harder, post-credits, to stroll out into Cannes, where the pinched lips and harassed foreheads are a depressingly familiar sight. Saturday night inside the festival&apos;s giant screening room, the Salle Debussy, had the feel of a party. It was the first showing of the new Coen brothers film, and once every seat had gone people flopped down on stairs and sat crossed-legged in the aisles. It was worth the cram. Inside Llewyn Davis is a hoot. It follows a fortnight in the life of luckless Llewyn (Oscar Isaac), a throaty folk singer in 1960s Manhattan who has begun to feel that jumper-wearing harmony groups are making his rootsier, uncommercial music redundant. In Big Lebowski fashion the Coens launch Llewyn on a meandering quest involving cats, a Chicago impresario and several memorable cameos, including John Goodman&apos;s jazzman (a heroin addict and practitioner of black magic) and Stark Sands&apos;s rising strummer, a private in the army who cheerfully announces: &quot;Armaments are not my thing.&quot; Carey Mulligan has fun in her supporting role as the foul-mouthed folkie, Jean. &quot;Everything you touch turns to shit,&quot; she tells Llewyn. &quot;You&apos;re like King Midas&apos;s idiot brother.&quot; This, though, is Oscar Isaac&apos;s movie. An actor with a strange CV (he was the bearded bad guy in Ridley Scott&apos;s Robin Hood\u2026 and not a lot else), Isaac wrestles a place alongside the best of the Coens&apos; unorthodox heroes. In scattered musical interludes he performs convincing and anguished folk songs which, unusually, are given the space to play out from start to finish. Quipping through Llewyn&apos;s layered misfortune \u2013 Woody Allen with a guitar case \u2013 Isaac never lets pathos squash the humour in the Coens&apos; superb script. &quot;Don&apos;t you ever think about the future?&quot; asks an exasperated Jean, to which Llewyn can only reply, after a think, &quot;Like flying cars?&quot; Guillaume Canet, the French actor-turned-director who made 2011&apos;s Little White Lies, is a great favourite here at Cannes. His picture is on a bus stop in the centre of town \u2013 not an advert, just a big blow-up of his face: have a bit of Guillaume while you wait. I worry that picture might have to be taken down after his new film, Blood Ties, premiered last week. This is Canet&apos;s first English-language work, a 70s-set cop thriller co-scripted with James Gray, and it&apos;s a lolloping, two-and-a-half hour dud \u2013 terribly paced, and boring enough for someone in the audience to flip open his phone and text for a good half-hour in the middle. It said much about the general malaise, at the screening I attended, that nobody told him not to. Clive Owen plays a crook, Chris, new out of jail. His brother Frank (Billy Crudup) is a cop, charged to keep Chris out of trouble. Do events come to a head? Over a heist? A heist that involves crashed Cadillacs and stubby pistols and calls for back-up and crim-on-crim betrayal? Check, check, check. Little White Lies had a marathon running time that was justified, I think, by a well-meant effort to give room to a large group of central characters. No such excuse for Blood Ties, which is lifeless from Chris and Frank&apos;s first encounter, and finds poor James Caan and Marion Cotillard lost in fuzzy supporting roles. The trouble is that Blood Ties has none of the flinty, worked-on little lines that enliven the best thrillers and help distract from implausibilities of plot. By the end, exhausted by clich\u00e9, I&apos;d resorted to simply writing down the worst: &quot;You&apos;re a fine officer but this looks bad, Frank\u2026&quot; &quot;Trust me, this is just the beginning\u2026&quot; &quot;I&apos;ve never been more sane in my life!&quot; After its premiere, one of the local Cannes newspapers panned the film, writing of Canet, &quot;alt mal int\u00e9gr\u00e9 la difference entre hommage et caricature&quot;. Although I can&apos;t translate that precisely I&apos;m pretty sure I agree. Better, brighter, sharper was Valeria Bruni Tedeschi&apos;s comedy A Castle in Italy. It tells of retired screen actor Louise (played by the director, who also co-wrote the script) and her family, once very wealthy and now in decline. Louise, in her 40s, wants a baby with her younger boyfriend, Nathan (Louis Garrel). Meanwhile her brother (Fillipo Timi) copes with a degenerative illness and her mother (Marisa Borini) ponders selling the family Breughel to settle debts. Scenes between Louise and Nathan are the nimblest, benefiting from great economy of storytelling. In conversation with a minor character, Louise is seized mid-sentence by an impulse to see Nathan and literally sprints across Paris to meet him. That&apos;s how you keep things moving! (Canet, let&apos;s guess, would have had her ease upright, muse over a route, tie her shoelaces, choose a coat\u2026) This is a strongly autobiographical work, based on Bruni Tedeschi&apos;s recent real-life experiences and in which she cast both her own mother and her only-just-ex-boyfriend to play their fictional counterparts. (Alas no role for Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, the director&apos;s sister.) Plenty of people I spoke to in Cannes found A Castle in Italy too pleased with itself, even a bit offensive, given that its central thrust is the story of family learning to cope with being slightly less than ultra-rich. Still, I found it funny and touching, a close study of the fussy relationships between family members. It was also notable as the only film by a female director in competition for the Palme d&apos;Or. Will it get the prize? Probably not. Cannes regulars have been having trouble picking a winner this year, resorting to rumour, second-guessing, everything but tea leaves. Didn&apos;t somebody see Nicole Kidman, one of the judges, well up while watching Like Father, Like Son, the Hirokazu Kore-eda film about cute kids? Alexander Payne&apos;s latest, Nebraska, another of his comedy-dramas about an ageing man adrift, went down well but there&apos;s a feeling Steven Spielberg, chairing the jury, won&apos;t want to toss the prize to an American peer. The arthouse crowd adored Blue Is the Warmest Colour, a three-hour epic about a lesbian love affair; my choice would be Sorrentino. At the time of writing, there&apos;s still a Jim Jarmusch (Only Lovers Left Alive) and a Roman Polanski (Venus in Fur) to come. The winner will be announced on Sunday night.

Expats claim to use it as a bellwether for the quality of a restaurant: if the kitchen gets the pad thai right, they probably know how to cook. Quite a claim for a dish that&apos;s not neither very Thai nor very traditional \u2013 the dish&apos;s full name, kway teow pad thai, or &quot;stir-fried rice noodles, Thai-style&quot; hints at its probable southern Chinese origins (kway teow apparently means rice noodles in the Hokkien dialect), and it&apos;s thought to have been popularised, and possibly invented, by Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram in the 1940s as part of his campaign to foster a sense of national identity. According to an article in the journal Gastromica, Thais were supposed to unite behind this noodle dish \u2013 and unite they did, for good reason. It&apos;s quick street food, a little spicy, a little sweet, and utterly delicious. Who would have thought your takeaway favourite had such an interesting history? Like many apparently simple dishes, pad thai is quick, but not necessarily easy. Indeed, Leela Punyaratabandhu has a whole series on the basics of pad thai on her excellent blog, She Simmers, starting with picking the appropriate pan. So, this is clearly a recipe that deserves some careful attention. The pan     Pim Techamuanvivit's pad thai    Punyaratabandhu recommends a large, flat pan for optimal results: the larger surface area encourages evaporation, which is &quot;key to creating noodle strands that are well-seasoned and entirely cooked through while retaining a bit of chewiness&quot;. Everyone else uses a wok, which, in the absence of a such a large flat pan seems a good bet: the steep sides make it easier to keep the noodles off the heat while cooking the eggs and prawns on the base. Bangkok-born Pim Techamuanvivit gives more useful advice when she breaks the news that it&apos;s pointless to try to make more than two portions at the same time: any more will: &quot;I can guarantee \u2026 result in clumps of oily, sticky noodle unfit for human consumption.&quot; This is certainly true: it&apos;s hard enough to cook everything at the same time as it is without struggling to shift it around the pan. Noodles     Leela Punyaratabandhu's pad thai    These are of paramount importance \u2013 pad thai is a noodle dish, after all, and as Punyaratabandhu observes: &quot;When the noodles are badly cooked, they invariably drag everything else down with them.&quot; You need what are often called &quot;rice sticks&quot; \u2013 dried thin, flat noodles known as sen lek, 3-5mm wide. Which, it turns out, are incredibly difficult to cook properly. First of all, they require soaking before use. Rick Stein uses boiling water, which counts as cooking in my view. Any kind of hot water is apparently a no-no where the purists are concerned, even blanching the soaked noodles as David Thompson suggests in Thai Street Food. He reckons it prevents them from clumping together, but Punyaratabandhu claims this is the &quot;most guaranteed way of getting [them] to clump up&quot;, and I agree. (They&apos;re prone to clumping whatever you do. The best way to stop them doing this is to keep them moving, and make sure they don&apos;t dry out in the pan.) Soak the noodles in cold water until, as Punyaratabandhu says, they&apos;re soft enough to wind easily around your finger \u2013 &quot;like very al dente pasta&quot; as Techamuanvivit puts it. The problem I have, however, is cooking the noodles: three or four attempts end up inedibly chewy. The best solution seems to be to add a splash of water to the pan before adding the sauce, as Rosemary Brissenden suggests in South East Asian Food. It&apos;s vitally important to test one before deciding the dish is done. Experts may be able to feel the change through their spatulas, according to Punyaratabandhu, but I&apos;m assuming that, like me, you&apos;re at the beginner stage here. Stein tosses his noodles with sesame oil in what&apos;s presumably another attempt to forestall the clumping problem. Not only is the flavour out of place here, but it stops the noodles absorbing the pad thai sauce. The sauce     David Thompson's pad thai    Strictly speaking, there&apos;s no such thing as &quot;pad thai sauce&quot; \u2013 at least, you&apos;re unlikely to find one in an oriental supermarket, but in Thailand, you will see many vendors using a pre-prepared brown sludge. Punyaratabandhu, Techamuanvivit and Thompson all recommend doing likewise: as Techamuanvivit says, for an amateur, seasoning the dish in the wok dooms you to failure, because by the time you have added the tamarind, then the fish sauce, then the palm sugar, &quot;your noodle turns gooey, your protein done to the texture of a rubber eraser&quot;. That&apos;s just what Stein and Brissenden do however, and, apart from the stress of tipping in three separate bowls while keeping everything moving in the wok, it&apos;s impossible to adjust the flavour. It&apos;s also best to heat the three principle ingredients, tamarind, palm sugar and fish sauce, together as Punyaratabandhu and Techamuanvivit do, to melt the sugar. You can then taste it and adjust until you achieve your perfect balance of sweet, salty and sour.     Rosemary Brissenden's pad thai    To be fair, Brissenden has other fish to fry: her pad thai has a base of pureed shallot, garlic and chilli, which gives it a sweet heat. I find the shallots and chillis too dominant though. Such condiments are not unusual: Punyaratabandhu uses a vivid red shrimp paste in oil, which, she says, is common, though not entirely traditional in Thailand. It&apos;s too much for my timid tastes: the fish sauce and the volley of tiny dried shrimp are quite enough seafood for me. Stein, who has taken his recipe from a vendor at Bangkok&apos;s Ghost Gate, adds sweet chilli sauce. It&apos;s too sweet and too gloopy. Better to do as Techamuanvivit suggests and add a pinch of chilli powder to the sauce until it suits your palate. The protein     Rick Stein's pad thai    It&apos;s possible to customise pad thai with whatever you like, but prawns and firm tofu seem to be the most popular choice. According to Techamuanvivit, in some parts of Bangkok tiny dried shrimp are the only protein some customers can afford, and they feature in every single recipe I try, whatever else is in there. They add a subtle fishy savouriness. Stein sautees his prawn heads and shells in oil before cooking the dish, but I can&apos;t taste the difference: probably because everything tastes of sweet chilli sauce. Eggs are also near ubiquitous: Thompson suggests duck eggs for authenticity, but again, once they&apos;re scrambled, I defy anyone to taste the difference. Extras and garnishes Garlic is always welcome, but I don&apos;t think the shallots some use are necessary \u2013 the crunchy Chinese chives offer enough onion flavour, and a more interesting texture. Punyaratabandhu is very keen on ripe banana blossoms as well, but I draw a blank on that one.

Gay Pride parades have endured disruption, while a 2010 study found that Polish people were overwhelmingly against gay marriage.     Anna Grodzka, from Poland, is Europe\u2019s first transsexual MP.    Coming out takes courage, but even more so in a country where the Catholic church continues to dominate politics and societal attitudes. It makes the political career of Anna Grodzka \u2013 an MP in the Polish parliament \u2013 all the more remarkable. Elected in 2011 as a member of the Palikot&apos;s Movement party (her constituency is in Krakow), Anna is currently the world&apos;s only transsexual MP. She is the second transsexual MP in world history \u2013 after the former New Zealand MP, Georgina Beyer \u2013 and the third transgender MP after Beyer and the former Italian MP, Vladimir Luxuria. A vocal spokesperson for LGBT rights, Grodzka, aged 59, was recently invited by the LGBT campaigning group, The Kaleidoscope Trust, to give a lecture in London to mark IDAHO (International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia). It was during this visit that I was able to meet her and, with the aid of a translator, find out more about her remarkable story. Born in 1954, in the central Polish town of Otwock, Grodzka&apos;s political activism dates back to her student days. She became involved with the Polish United Workers&apos; Party, while pursuing an entrepreneurial career in publishing and film-making. She also married, and became father to a son. She says that she realised that she was transgender in her 20s, but because of her marriage, made the decision to present herself to the outside world as a man. Grodzka began to live life as a woman in 2007. In 2008, she founded a non-governmental organisation, Trans-Fuzja, devoted to the transgender community and advancement of LGBTQ rights in Poland. She underwent male-to-female surgery in 2010 in Bangkok, although she is quick to correct my terminology: &quot;I never changed my biological sex, I have only undergone adjustment surgery, because I don&apos;t believe you can change your sex. The surgery that trans people go through are adjustment procedures.&quot; Shortly afterwards, the party of which she is now a member, the Palikot&apos;s Movement, asked if she would stand as an MP. At first she declined, stating during her Kaleidoscope Trust appearance that standing would mean that she would never again &quot;be able to hide&quot;. Upon reflection, however, she decided to accept the invitation. Her elevation to MP indicates that Poland may well be making progress in its attitude towards LGBT people. Indeed, she is quick to defend her fellow countrymen when I suggest that Poland lags behind other nations in respect to LGBT rights, saying that it is impossible to make generalisations about the whole country. &quot;The real issue is a lot more complicated and Polish people are a lot more divided on the issue.&quot; Indeed, she says that she is &quot;100% confident that civil partnerships will become available in Poland at some stage. It&apos;s even possible that it could happen this year. In July, the draft bill on civil partnerships that was submitted by the ruling party will be debated in the Parliament. So, I&apos;m pretty sure it&apos;s going to happen \u2013 it&apos;s just a matter of time.&quot; She also acknowledges, however, that there is much work to be done. Only in February this year, former Polish president, Lech Walesa, disappointed many with his comments about gay politicians. He said, &quot;gay people belonged on the back benches of parliament\u2026 or even &apos;behind the wall&apos;.&quot; In response, Grodzka \u2013 and her fellow Palikot MP, Robert Biedron, Poland&apos;s only openly gay MP \u2013 purposefully placed themselves in the front row of the Parliamentary benches at the next available opportunity \u2013 an elegant and dignified protest. &quot;What I found striking in what he [Walesa] said was his whole philosophy and understanding of social fairness, because what he said meant that the majority can decide for everyone else, so minorities don&apos;t count.&quot; The Palikot&apos;s Movement is the third biggest party in the Polish parliament, which is currently dominated by the Liberal-Conservative Civic Platform party (PO), and the Conservative Law and Justice party (PiS). Some have claimed that the church&apos;s grip over the country is weakening, but Grodzka is not so sure. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t say the influence was weakening. I would say the influence remains strong because the political elite use the church as a tool in political propaganda, particularly in Conservative circles, and this is why the influence remains so stable.&quot; Since becoming an MP, despite being a member of the minority party, Grodzka has \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 become well-known in Poland. Has she received abuse? &quot;Definitely. I have been through unpleasant situations when I have met people who have shown contempt or displeasure,&quot; she says. Nevertheless, she says she has received less abuse than she anticipated. &quot;Because I am very well-recognised in Poland now, it gives me a lot of opportunity to observe reactions to me, and there are a lot more positive reactions than negative reactions.&quot; Her elevated profile in public life may now work in her favour, and help to break down public prejudices towards transgender people, but she is the first to admit that it has not always been so. Like most transgender people, explaining to friends and loved ones that she was transsexual, did not always elicit a supportive response. &quot;As you may suspect, this is the hardest part of the procedure. A lot of people, even those close to you, do not understand the change, and this is therefore the most difficult part. I would say that about half my friends \u2013 my fair-weather friends \u2013 have been lost.&quot; &quot;I have no relationship with my ex wife. She has taken that decision, and I am not surprised that she has taken that decision after I split on these grounds. If I could, I would have maintained a relationship with her \u2013 some sort of relationship. With my son, however, I have a very good, very strong and warm relationship.&quot; The 6&apos;2&quot; Grodzka says that she is currently single, and that she thinks it would be very difficult to now enter into a relationship. &quot;I don&apos;t have a partner, and it would be very difficult for me to have a partner now because of the fact that I am well-recognised in Poland, so it might be difficult for someone to accept,&quot; before adding with a mischievous smile, &quot;And where am I going to find a man taller than me?&quot; That answers my final question about how Grodzka would define her sexuality \u2013 whether she is attracted to men or women \u2013 but she once again resists being pigeon-holed, replying: &quot;You should be partnered with somebody who loves you, and who you love, and I have no idea who will fall in love with me, or who I will fall in love with.&quot; Having been on such an incredible and unexpected life journey, Grodzka is wise enough to know that one can rarely, reliably predict what might happen in the future.

I like to slow down so that I can know a place inside out, smell it, feel its heartbeat. That is why, when my partner, Ivan, and I set off for a long getaway, we pinpointed a single destination. Koh Tao, a tiny speck in the Gulf of Thailand, is known for its inexpensive Padi scuba training, and since Ivan had always wanted to become an expert diver, this was enough of a reason to call this island home for a while. On the surface, the main town of Koh Tao looks like any Thai holiday hotspot: palms, turquoise water, beach bums sipping Chang beers and charring their skin pink. Hawkers pace the beach with a selection of Ray-Bans; baby-faced backpackers in string bikinis flirt in beachside bars, drinking cocktails from buckets. But zipping past palm forests, monks and burning incense on our cheap hired scooter, we discovered a much lovelier beach in the south of the island called Chalok Baan Kao. With only a few hotels, restaurants and bars, this side of the island felt like a private retreat. A walk around the bay took us to a secluded beach with basic bungalows right on the sand, called Taraporn. For 500 baht a night (around \u00a311), we could fall asleep to a warm breeze off the water, and wake to lapping waves. After a while we decided to search for a property to rent for several months. The thrill of house hunting turned to frustration after six weeks, but finally Ivan returned from a solo hunt and declared: &quot;I found us a place at the top of a hill!&quot;     Million-dollar views over Koh Tao. Photograph: Torre DeRoche    It was in a breathtaking location \u2013 mostly in what it did to my lungs every time I had to hike up to it. The cottage was magnificently ugly, with a well-loved mattress, a rickety fan, a\u00a0kitchen devoid of cooking facilities, a cold dribble of water for a shower, a hand-flush toilet, a cast of giant geckos poised in attack-crouches (yes, they bite) and snakeskins left on the doorstep each morning. But its centrepiece made up for all that: French windows opening on to a panorama of sea, sky and beach encased by palm-covered hills. We paid a month&apos;s rent in cash, and Casa de Reptile was ours. We decorated it with goods from Bangkok&apos;s hellish Chatuchak weekend market, and had some of our own possessions sent over. While Ivan was off diving, I drilled holes, hung curtains and smoothed sheets to create a cottage worthy of a magazine spread. We clinked two cold beers at sunset, celebrating our luxurious retreat with its million-dollar view. The rent? Five dollars a night. When we weren&apos;t exploring, Ivan studied diving while I worked on my book. The island&apos;s internet connection was generally solid enough to keep a line of communication between me and my book editor in New York. However, upholding professional standards while living on a Thai island was not without its challenges. One evening, while I was in the middle of an interview booked months earlier, a thunderstorm cut off the power supply. My interviewer was silenced mid-question, and I felt embarrassed at my lack of professionalism until the connection returned \u2026 five days later.     Torre de Roche outside her bungalow     We found plenty of other things to do, including yoga, sunset beach runs, and diving. Even for me, with my morbid fear of deep water, the island&apos;s collective enthusiasm for underwater exploration became impossible to resist. After a few days of instruction, I got my open water licence and then did something I thought I&apos;d never do: a night dive in pitch-black water. So much for that phobia. With more than 40 dive schools, the island sends home around 50,000 certified open water divers a year, and instructors pour in from all over the world to teach them. Environmental initiatives including underwater clean-up days, long-distance swims for shark conservation, and sustainability meetings brought the diving community together. In the evenings we&apos;d gather at a bar for &quot;big Chang&quot; beers and excited chat about who&apos;d spotted a turtle or a whale shark that day. Babaloo beachside bar in Chalok Baan Kao became our favourite nightspot. Just outside, along the shore, svelte fire-twirlers would throw their flaming sticks into the air, never missing a catch or losing an eyebrow ... To renew our visas for a longer stay, we were required to leave Thailand, so we took a train to Vientiane, capital of Laos, and explored the picturesque Bolaven plateau by scooter before returning to Koh Tao. I&apos;ve travelled in many different ways: from whirlwind trips to meditative, immersive travel. I&apos;ve learned that there is more richness in getting to know one place intimately than many places superficially. Every country has a heart and a soul that you can&apos;t find in a guidebook. Like with any relationship, getting to know a place intimately takes patience, mindfulness and time.

Speaking in a more mellow, less provocative manner than during his previous incarnation as Chelsea troll-in-chief, Mourinho delivered two key points: firstly, that he is back at Stamford Bridge because it is where he wants to be, not because no one else wanted him; and secondly, that what he and Chelsea are all about now is \u2026 stability. So more mellow and less provocative, but Mourinho clearly still has a sense of humour. Mourinho, of course, had already billed his return as the continuation of an enduring love for Chelsea but there was a suspicion that it is not so much the depth of his devotion to that club that has brought him back as the lack of love from anyone else. Nonsense, insisted the Special One, suggesting we must have imagined all that eye-lid fluttering in the direction of Old Trafford prior to Manchester United&apos;s plumping for David Moyes. &quot;No,&quot; insisted the Special One when asked whether he would prefer to have been named United manager. &quot;This is where I want to be.&quot; He declared that if he arrived as the Special One last time, now he is &quot;the Happy One. Time flies. It feels like it was a couple of days ago but it was nine years ago. Since then, a lot of things have happened in my professional life. I have the same nature, I am the same person, I have the same heart and I have the same emotions relating to my passion and my job but I am a different person.&quot; There persists a suspicion that this is not a triumphant return of an all-conquering hero, more like the resigned repatriation of a chastened young backpacker who ran out of money and pals in Bangkok and had to ring his parents for a plane ticket home. But Mourinho is having none of that: instead he insists that after years of wandering Europe sowing his wild seeds and savouring other experiences, he realised it was time to settle down in the place he likes best. Stability is what he wants. &quot;Now I am prepared for stability because, to be fair, before I wasn&apos;t,&quot; he said. &quot;I was in a position [at the end of the season just gone] to say which league I prefer, which mentality I prefer ... so now it&apos;s up to me to work hard and show my club that I deserve to be here for a long time. I have a contract for four years and I hope to go to the last day of that and if the club then wants to keep me, I&apos;ll be happy.&quot; Mourinho denied that a clash with Roman Abramovich was what led to his downfall last time and declared that the pair are set for a long and happy working relationship in a new era of stability \u2013 did we mention he wants to stability? \u2013 at the Bridge. &quot;I read and I kept listening I was fired, I was sacked, we had a complete break of relationships. That was not true. Many people didn&apos;t believe in that, but it was mutual agreement. . It wouldn&apos;t be possible being here if we&apos;d had real problems, no relations. I&apos;m back because we feel we are in a moment of my professional life ... where we are probably in the best moment of our careers, and ready to work together again and with much better conditions this time to succeed and have what this club wants: which is stability.&quot; It is going to be interesting seeing how long Mourinho remains the Happy One.

But two British wildlife parks have been accused of unethical practices for breeding white lions taken from a farm linked to &quot;canned hunting&quot; in South Africa and allowing cubs to be petted for \u00a3250 a time. Despite zoo associations in Europe and America ordering zoos not to breed white lions because they are already inbred and suffer severe health problems, Paradise wildlife park in Hertfordshire and its sister zoo, the Wildlife Heritage Foundation in Kent produced five white cubs in 2013. Paradise wildlife park initially charged \u00a3999 to cuddle its latest cub before amending its offer to \u00a3250. &quot;It is a scandal,&quot; said Pieter Kat, founder of LionAid. &quot;It is an unethical process from so many different angles. They are bringing these animals from someone associated with canned lion hunting. They continue to inbreed them and they allow petting which is unethical.&quot; The European Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums is currently investigating the matter. Lynn Whitnall, director of Paradise wildlife park and a member of the family that own both parks, said: &quot;The white lions are extremely well looked after.&quot; She added: &quot;They are good as ambassadors. They are good for education. They are good for raising funds, not just for our business but to do the conservation work we do.&quot; White lions were first spotted on a game reserve near the Kruger national park in South Africa. Since 1995, the captive population has exploded from just 10 to around 500, driven by a number of South African breeders. Most of these animals are sold for up to \u00a360,000 to trophy hunters, who shoot them in fenced areas \u2013 the controversial but currently legal practice called canned hunting. White lions have a rare recessive gene and the only way to guarantee a white cub is to breed two white lions, producing extremely inbred animals that suffer from deformities and high mortality. A scientific study found 17 of 19 white lion cubs born in an Italian zoo were stillborn or died within a month of birth. Another was euthanised after six months because it could not bite its food and the sole survivor at 30 months was malformed. The British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA), of which Paradise Wildlife Park and the Wildlife Heritage Foundation are members, has ruled there is no conservation value in keeping white lions. &quot;Inbreeding practices as necessary to produce white lions impair the ability to develop and maintain sustainable captive populations and to deliver the appropriate animal welfare and conservation educational messages,&quot; it said in recently published guidelines. The European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) and the American Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums (AZA) have also both instructed their members not to deliberately breed white lions. In 2006, Paradise wildlife park obtained two white lion cubs from Wiets Botes, a South African lion breeder who also offers trophy hunts where captive-bred lions can be shot. The Wildlife Heritage Foundation acquired two more white lions from Botes in 2012. &quot;The lions we&apos;ve taken from there have a very good home,&quot; said Whitnall. She said her park was not aware that Botes also offered to arrange canned hunting. Paradise wildlife park and the Wildlife Heritage Foundation help fund projects to conserve endangered big cats such as Amur leopards and tigers in Russia and Bangladesh. Marita du Plessis, manager of Wiets Safaris, confirmed that Botes could arrange lion hunting but said they never conducted the hunts on their own land or with the animals they bred. According to du Plessis, Botes only sold his white lions to zoos and not for canned hunting. Petting lion cubs was condemned by the Captive Animals Protection Society (Caps) for causing unnecessary stress when the youngster was separated from its mother. &quot;We&apos;re very concerned about the lion cubs&apos; welfare,&quot; said Liz Tyson, director of Caps. &quot;We are also concerned about the message \u2013 if you pay enough money you can come and cuddle these animals. That&apos;s completely against zoos&apos; supposed purpose to educate people about wild animals. &quot; But Whitnall defended the zoos&apos; &quot;meet the cub&quot; sessions saying the white lion cub sessions were only held for a short period this spring when the cubs had routine health checks and were &quot;under a cub&apos;s terms&quot; so the animal would decide if it wanted to sit on someone&apos;s lap. &quot;Nine out of 10 times the cub wants to sit with them,&quot; she said. Animal welfare charities criticised BIAZA for failing to take action against the zoos but BIAZA said it was awaiting the outcome of the EAZA investigation. Whitnall said both parks were liaising with BIAZA and EAZA over their white lions and currently had no plans to breed any more. Kirsten Pullen, chief executive of BIAZA, said: &quot;We do not encourage the breeding of white lions or tigers. We work with zoos to continuously improve animal welfare standards in tandem with research developments, and to phase out any undesirable activities before taking more extreme action such as expelling members.&quot; According to Pullen, zoos are expected to &quot;show due diligence with regards to where our animals have been sourced from&quot; and new regulations are being drafted to tackle acquiring animals from dealers and canned hunters.

The manager will tell all-comers they must impress him first-hand in pre-season if they are to earn a key role in the side, having made it clear there will be &quot;no privileges&quot; afforded to any of a party which includes a quintet of players who featured under him during his first spell at Stamford Bridge. All will be expected to buy into Mourinho&apos;s approach and meet the demands he places on them, as the manager considers his options with 27 fringe players and youngsters due to return from loan spells seeking involvement in the senior set-up. The bulk of the squad is due to report to Cobham on 8 July, before the side&apos;s departure for a three-match tour of Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia that week. Chelsea have six players \u2013 David Luiz, Oscar, Mikel John Obi, C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, Juan Mata and Fernando Torres \u2013 preparing for the Confederations Cup, which begins on Saturday in Brazil, and that contingent are likely to be granted more time off before linking up with their team-mates in Bangkok. That means it may be mid-July or later before Mourinho has spoken personally to them all and subsequently puts the finishing touches to his squad. The Portuguese said that &quot;one or two&quot; additions will be made, with interest retained in Edinson Cavani at Napoli \u2013 though Chelsea will be reluctant to meet the \u20ac63m (\u00a354m) buy-out clause in the Uruguayan&apos;s contract \u2013 and, more realistically, a deal understood to be close for Fiorentina&apos;s Steven Jovetic at around \u00a325m. The Italian club hope to secure Bayern Munich&apos;s Mario Gomez as a replacement. There have been suggestions in Poland that Robert Lewandowski&apos;s agent, Cezary Kucharski, will visit London on Friday as Borussia Dortmund continue to resist the forward&apos;s desire to move to Bayern, though the Pole&apos;s preference remains forcing through a move to the Allianz Arena. Mourinho could yet have to generate more funds for incoming transfers through sales should he decide the squad is particularly short in some areas, with David Luiz \u2013 who has attracted tentative interest from Barcelona \u2013 arguably the most saleable asset. His sale, however, would be politically delicate given the favourable impression the Brazilian made last season. Torres, who has three years to run on his contract, may also be moved on, though it seems unlikely that a rival club would come in with an acceptable offer for the Spaniard and then be willing to offer him an equivalent salary. Regardless, the manager will discuss the situation with the striker before any decision is made having made great play of his desire to operate &quot;by meritocracy&quot; at his first press conference on Monday. &quot;There are still a few boys from my time, and it is always good to go back and see these people who gave absolutely everything to me when I was here before,&quot; he said. &quot;But it&apos;s important to tell you \u2013 not them, because they know \u2013 that [there will be] no privilege for them. They know my nature. They don&apos;t have an advantage in relation to the other people.&quot; Mikel has controversially declared himself available to play for Nigeria against Namibia on Wednesday \u2013 before his side&apos;s departure for Brazil \u2013 in a World Cup qualifier to be staged on an artificial surface.

After working as a secondary teacher in Britain and abroad, she joined the team developing the Nuffield Primary Mathematics programme in 1960. The resulting course, which focused on understanding rather than rote learning, was used in about half of all primary schools in England. In the 1970s Kath worked as a teacher-training lecturer and a Unesco adviser before joining a research team at Chelsea College, London, where she led the mathematics part of the influential Concepts in Secondary Mathematics and Science. This, and similar projects she directed, produced substantial new insights into how mathematical ideas were understood by secondary pupils. It brought her international recognition and a visiting professorship at King&apos;s College London. The resulting book, Children&apos;s Understanding of Mathematics: 11-16, became a bestseller with significant influence on educational practice and research. An early member and later president (1990-92) of the International Group for the Psychology of Mathematics Education, she promoted rigorous standards of research in mathematics education and touched the lives of children and teachers around the world. She was born to working-class parents in Whitechapel, east London. Her primary schooling was fragmented by the second world war, but, as a beneficiary of the 1944 Education Act, she went to Hull University. Kath&apos;s ability to talk in clear English, her empathy and her hard work ensured that she was highly regarded worldwide in the field of education. She became professor of mathematics education at Nottingham University in the 1990s and colleagues valued her support, effectiveness at fundraising and commitment in supervising overseas students. Her deeply held Catholic faith and socialist principles informed everything she did and many students were helped by her, practically as well as academically. Even after retirement, Kath worked and travelled; two months before her death, and in the late stages of cancer, she gave seminars in Bangkok. She was a governor of her local primary school, looked after her mother in the last years of her life and introduced her nephews (and many others) to world travel. Kath was a loyal friend, over decades and continents; she loved opera, theatre, a glass of wine or a G&amp;T and talking.

A travel alert, dated Monday 10 June on a Home Office letterhead, said carriers should not allow Snowden to board because &quot;the individual is highly likely to be refused entry to the UK&quot;. The Associated Press news agency saw a photograph of the document taken on Friday at a Thai airport. A British diplomat confirmed to AP that the document was genuine and was sent to airlines around the world. A Thai airline official also confirmed the alert had been issued. The official said such alerts were issued to carriers that flew into the UK, adding that any carrier bringing in Snowden would be liable to a \u00a32,000 fine. He said it was likely the Home Office had deemed Snowden&apos;s presence in the UK to be detrimental to the &quot;public good&quot;. The Home Office refused to confirm or deny the report, saying only: &quot;We do not comment on individual cases.&quot; Snowden, 29, has revealed himself as the source of top-secret documents about American NSA surveillance programmes that were reported earlier by the Guardian and Washington Post. He is believed to be in Hong Kong. The US citizen has not been charged with any crime and no warrants have been issued for his arrest. The alert was issued by the Risk and Liaison Overseas Network, part of the UK Border Agency, which has staff in several countries identified as major transit points for inadequately documented passengers. The document, titled &quot;RALON Carrier Alert 15/13&quot;, had a photograph of Snowden and gave his date of birth and passport number. It said: &quot;If this individual attempts to travel the UK: Carriers should deny boarding.&quot; Airlines allowing him to travel would &quot;be liable to costs relating to the individual&apos;s detention and removal&quot;, it said. According to the diplomat, carrier alerts are issued when the UK government wants to deny entry to people who don&apos;t normally need visas to enter the country, or whose visas were issued before something happened. He said the alerts were sometimes issued to deny convicted sex offenders entry to the UK. A Bangkok Airways officer said the airline was notified on Thursday about the alert by the Airports of Thailand, which operates national airports throughout the country. She said the notice was not intended to be seen by the public. British Airways was unable to comment on the alert. A member of staff referred the Guardian to the Home Office, adding: &quot;We comply with government requirements.&quot; Virgin Atlantic, which flies direct to London from Hong Kong, said it would not comment on security issues. It was not clear if governments in other countries had issued similar documents. However, Air France KLM, which connects China to Britain via the hubs in Paris and Amsterdam, said it had not received any alerts regarding Snowden. The WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange criticised the move, describing Snowden as a hero. &quot;The British government should be offering Mr Snowden asylum, not excluding him from their borders. Edward Snowden is a hero \u2013 his revelations disclose something that is important to almost everyone in the world,&quot; said Assange, who has been inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London for almost a year. He is wanted in Sweden for questioning about allegations of sexual offences and has expressed fears that if returned to Sweden he could also face extradition to the US over the leaking of secret US logs on the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. In Hong Kong, where a &quot;Support Snowden&quot; rally organised by human rights and other groups will march past the US consulate on Saturday afternoon, two pan-democratic lawmakers urged the US president to stop legal action against Snowden and consider letting him go. &quot;I&apos;m actually asking the United States not to even try to charge [Snowden],&quot; Claudia Mo Man-ching of the Civic party told the South China Morning Post on Friday. Mo and Gary Fan Kwok-wai of the NeoDemocrats have written an open letter to Barack Obama urging him to ensure &quot;national security&quot; claims are not used to justify abuse of state power. It argues: &quot;While we accept that Mr Snowden may be deemed to have contravened US law, we believe he may have done liberal democracy a service by stimulating serious discussion in many countries of the extent to which surveillance is acceptable in liberal, democratic societies \u2026 We urge you to tread very carefully and take account of the views of America&apos;s democratic friends around the world.&quot; Mo told the Guardian: &quot;The government should not keep secrets from the people. People should be able to keep some secrets from the government.&quot; Hong Kong&apos;s legislative council has said it will discuss the case at a meeting next Wednesday, following a request from lawmaker Ma Fung-kwok, who said the public needed more information on a possible surrender request from the US and Snowden&apos;s claims that the US hacked Hong Kong targets.

One such moment is at the luggage information desk at Dubai&apos;s colossal, soul-sucking airport where, after the third overnight flight, the inevitable has happened and our bags have finally gone astray. Atherton has just done a full cooking shift at 22 Ships, his inspired tapas bar in the heart of Hong Kong&apos;s old red light district, while simultaneously checking in with staff about the lunch service at his Michelin-starred London home, Pollen Street Social, and fielding emails about his new ventures in Sydney and Shanghai. He&apos;s due at a meeting with a developer working with the InterContinental hotel group in Dubai at 9am to sign off on a deal to open a new waterfront property worth several million dollars. He is in the jeans and T-shirt he has tried to sleep in on the plane, and unshowered. At 7am the glum manager of the luggage information desk, at which we are the sole customers, is showing little interest in our missing bags. After extensive walkie-talkie conversations and a languid, fruitless search for a pen with which to take our details, a long hour or so has passed before he relays the information that &quot;I think your bags are somewhere in the system&quot;. At which point you might imagine Gordon or Marco, testosterone pumping, jetlag jagging, would have taken some selfish relief in reducing the manager, his system and the entire luggage information operation at Dubai International to a lightly astringent jus. Atherton, who worked for Ramsay for 10 years, creating the highly successful Maze, and who has, as I have witnessed in various time zones, an obsessive interest in the efficiencies of service, remains courteous. &quot;I tell you what,&quot; he says, &quot;I wanted to have a look at the fish market this morning before the meeting, so we&apos;ll head out there, and perhaps if our bags turn up we can pay for them to be sent on to the hotel?&quot;     Jason Atherton at Deira Fish Market in Dubai. Photograph: Richard Saker    We head to the fish market, a dockside hangar in which an extraordinary variety of sea creatures have been dredged from the Gulf to be vigorously descaled, chopped and then examined by some of the desert city&apos;s army of chefs. Atherton is in his element, enthused by the idea that &quot;there are probably 30 species here I&apos;ve never cooked&quot; and therefore further excited by the prospect of his Dubai kitchen, which might be open by the autumn, if he makes his InterContinental meeting. We head to the hotel to find the bags have been delivered, testament to Atherton&apos;s patience and local knowledge (&quot;I worked here for Gordon for four years and I know if you start shouting the odds to locals you are screwed&quot;). The chef makes his meeting, signs his deal, does a walking tour of the first-floor shell of a skyscraper fronting the marina in which his restaurant will take shape, and is still smiling at lunchtime when he sits down at the waterside opposite the building site, and celebrates the contract with a carrot juice. &quot;The thing is,&quot; he says of our morning, &quot;if I start to get annoyed about a lost bag or whatever, I just make sure I immediately give myself a kick up the butt. You know, I&apos;ve had more difficult days than these\u2026&quot; Atherton&apos;s journey to this particular waterfront began at a seaside about as far from the glass-fronted fantasy of Dubai&apos;s marina as you can imagine. Born in Sheffield, he moved with his mother to Skegness after his parents separated when he was three. He lived with his mum and his sister in a caravan, &quot;quite cosy but frigging cold in the winter&quot;, and got his first taste of kitchens and hotels at a guesthouse, the Maryland, that his mother set up on Skegness&apos;s North Sea coast. &quot;Even in the holidays we always had to work,&quot; Atherton, now 41, recalls. &quot;I would get up early to help do the breakfasts, then go out and be a donkey boy, doing rides for kids on the beach all day, then come back, help with the evening meal. My stepdad Dave was a joiner. He would be out first thing on building sites, then come back and put a dickie bow and a white shirt on and work the bar until midnight. On a Friday, the treat for my sister and me was to watch the telly, plugged into the cigarette lighter of the car, with pop and crisps, for an hour before the battery ran down.&quot;     Jason Atherton's quote which is on the wall of his 22 Ships restaurant in Hong Kong. Photograph: Richard Saker    This work ethic has clearly never left Atherton. After &quot;24 years busting my nuts in other people&apos;s kitchens&quot;, he invested every last penny of his savings into Pollen Street Social in Mayfair only two years ago; with the help of partners he now has eight restaurants and counting across the world (two others opened earlier this year in London, Little Social, over the road from the original, and the Social Eating House, in Soho). All have quickly won praise and awards and, more to the point, customers. &quot;We have two kinds of restaurants, extremely successful ones and successful ones, but they all make money,&quot; he says and shows me the daily incoming texts of takings to prove it. Esquina, for example, has paid back its investment in just 10 months. Atherton, who is married to Ihra, a Filipina who worked with him in Dubai, and has two daughters, aged seven and two, is about to start filming a TV series for Sky, My Kitchen Rules, in which couples compete to create pop-up restaurants in their front rooms; he has three cookbooks in the works. It is, you might say, his moment; but having seen casualties of previous such moments up close, he is anxious, desperate, not to let it go to his head. One of the fascinations of Atherton&apos;s rise \u2013 White singled him out recently as one of only three or four &quot;proper&quot; British cooks \u2013 is that he is very much a second-generation figure; he has learned from the excesses of the celebrity fathers. He won&apos;t say a bad word about Ramsay but they don&apos;t see each other now \u2013 &quot;his choice not mine&quot;; the Scot was characteristically annoyed that his protege eventually left Maze, but still Atherton has learned, he says, from his old boss, &quot;both what to do and what not to do&quot;. Much of this is detail. In his autobiography, Ramsay reveals that when he started out he was in the habit of chucking any complaints from customers in the bin. The chef was always right. In the course of our travels, Atherton has any complaints made in any of his outposts immediately texted over to him. In Hong Kong he discovers that a lunch party in Singapore had to wait 20 minutes for dessert, while one of 100 diners in Soho at lunchtime thought his steak a little fatty. Atherton immediately responds with questions to sous chefs and maitre d&apos;s, and apologies to customers. He talks in passing, &quot;don&apos;t quote me&quot;, of memorably truculent guests over the years but prides himself on never losing his rag. &quot;I&apos;ve never chucked anyone out,&quot; he says, &quot;and I don&apos;t imagine I ever will. I have had people in Pollen Street say &apos;there is not a single thing on this menu I like&apos;. But I kill them with kindness. I go out and say, tell me what you want and I will happily cook it for you. I&apos;m not interested in &apos;chef knows best&apos; bullshit.&quot; When Atherton worked for Nico Ladenis in London in the early 90s they weren&apos;t allowed to put salt and pepper on the table. &quot;If people asked for pepper, Nico would likely ask them to leave. To me, if someone likes a lot of pepper, it&apos;s not a problem. He has paid for it, he can do what he likes.&quot; It&apos;s tempting to think that some of this spirit is a legacy from Skegness. He agrees that there was probably no tougher crowd to please. &quot;We had busloads every week from Doncaster, Barnsley, Rotherham, Nottingham,&quot; Atherton recalls. &quot;We would have Leicester week, in which the only question you ever heard was &apos;Ow much is it, duck?&apos; I&apos;d have to check with my mum but I think to start with it was about \u00a33.50 for the weekend, bed and board, so it wasn&apos;t bad value.&quot; Atherton brought a good deal of that can-do possibility down to London with him. At 16, he wrote to the top 20 chefs in the country, from Raymond Blanc down, and asked if they might find a space for him. He received a positive reply from one, Boyd Gilmour, who had left the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra to set up Boyd&apos;s in Covent Garden. Atherton came down with his knives and his whites, said he could start tomorrow and that was that. He lived in the youth hostel in Earl&apos;s Court for two years with about a tenner a week to spend and &quot;loved every second of it&quot;. He didn&apos;t travel abroad until he was 22, working a season at the three-star Auberge de L&apos;Ill in Alsace. Five years after that he became the first non-Spanish speaker to work with Ferran Adri\u00e0 at El Bulli having turned up with a backpack and refused to leave until he got a trial in the world&apos;s best kitchen. In between times he cooked with White in his heyday at Harvey&apos;s and then at the Hyde Park hotel. His time in Spain perhaps gives most clues to the kind of cooking Ahterton aspires to now \u2013 smart, witty plates, with intense flavours, made with sharing in mind. &quot;You stepped into that kitchen and it was like you were in a different world,&quot; he says of El Bulli. From White, the original el bully, he learned something about man management. &quot;You&apos;d try not to catch Marco&apos;s eye at midnight when he was off hunting with his mates, otherwise you would be up making bacon sandwiches for them when they got back at five in the morning and then straight on to prepping,&quot; he says. He put up with that, and even, he hesitates to suggest, the occasional physical confrontation, because &quot;Marco was the best chef working in Britain. He was so fast and so perfect, all out of this complete chaos.&quot;     Jason Atherton and staff outside his Pollen restaurant at Gardens by the Bay in downtown Singapore. Photograph: Richard Saker    As I witness a few times, watching him at work, at the futuristic Pollen in Singapore, which is housed in a glass-domed botanical gardens on the bay, or at Esquina, his tapas bar in that heart of that city, Atherton is hardly reticent when imposing his standards on his chefs. He is only here for a day or two, so each observation has to count. &quot;When I do give someone a hard time it&apos;s usually if they disrespect ingredients, or if the veg is not packed away properly in the morning. I know it sounds OCD but my organic carrots, I don&apos;t want them tossed in a scruffy container: they are laid down nicely all facing the right way and treated with respect. I get angry if stuff like that is not done, but not madman angry.&quot; A running theme of our travels is the fact that Atherton only ever gets asked two questions by journalists: &quot;How did you survive working with Gordon?&quot; and &quot;Aren&apos;t you in danger of spreading yourself too thin?&quot; In a sense one of the questions answers the other. Atherton eventually left Maze not because of Ramsay, &quot;but because I couldn&apos;t work with his father-in-law [Chris Hutcheson, Ramsay&apos;s then business partner]. I tried for years. But it was time to move on.&quot; Atherton has so far been luckier with his own business partners. His principal backer is Mrs Mavis Oei, owner of the Goodwood Park group of hotels and daughter of the late Khoo Teck Puat, once Singapore&apos;s richest man. Oei was seduced by Atherton&apos;s food \u2013 he cooked for her first at Maze and then at her homes in Bray and in the Far East. Having invited him over to discuss a business proposition in 2011, she refused to let him return to the UK until he had signed a deal by which she offered an initial \u00a33m as finance for a 25% stake in what became Pollen Street Social. The rest of the opportunities have flowed from there.     In a meeting with business partner Peng Loh.  Photograph: Richard Saker    In Singapore, Atherton has breakfast with Peng Loh, a former lawyer who has hotel and restaurant interests throughout the world, including London&apos;s Viajante and One Leicester Street. Their plans for the former Foster&apos;s brewery building in Sydney are laid out on the table. &quot;What do the Australians eat for breakfast?&quot; Peng wonders. &quot;Well, I do this great kind of mini-English breakfast on a proper pizza,&quot; Atherton suggests, which sounds about right. In Hong Kong he meets Yenn Wong, perhaps the most immaculately groomed woman I have ever encountered, with whom he is renovating PMQ, the former colonial police barracks in the middle of town, with a casual &quot;bread oven-type place&quot; downstairs and a &quot;farm-to-table eating&quot; restaurant upstairs. There is talk of tracking down &quot;the only properly organic farmer in China&quot; for the veg. Yenn takes a precise note. She helped to design 22 Ships and they have plans for a speakeasy across the street. All of which begs an answer to the second of the two questions Atherton is perennially asked: is he in danger of spreading himself too thin? Inevitably, I guess, but the trick is to find chefs who instinctively know what he wants, for each of his satellites, and to keep them happy. He has a scheme for Andy Walsh, a young Irish chef doing precise wonders at Esquina, which gives him a 10% profit share. His chefs in Hong Kong and London are on the same incentive once the restaurants have earned back their investment. &quot;I feel like the bloke who did Dolly the Sheep,&quot; he says at one point. &quot;We clone them and we put them in a box and we ship them out. It&apos;s like Madagascar 3, crates of chefs marked fragile.&quot;            Atherton will have to find a few more crates yet. Three other London properties are planned for this year or next. A collaboration with the ultimate concept man Ian Schrager in the now defunct Berners Hotel; a City Social satellite of his deconstructed Pollen Street concept in Tower 42; and perhaps something in the old Bow Street Magistrates building in Covent Garden. Only a few places are beyond the pale. He was recently approached to do something in Moscow. (&quot;I have no desire even to visit.&quot;) Likewise Tokyo: too many great restaurants already. Otherwise, the world still seems a newly shucked oyster. Looking at that world through the eyes of a chef like Atherton is a curious thing. Cities become not so much multi-faceted metropolises as the home to places you can buy food. &quot;When we are not working in restaurants we are eating in restaurants,&quot; Atherton says, and in my time with him this seems literally true. In Singapore he takes his chefs for spicy crab at the beach on their Sunday lunch off; in Hong Kong we visit the cheapest Michelin-starred restaurant in the world, the dim sum canteen Tim Ho Wan. In Dubai he checks out, and loves, La Petite Maison, and puts his head round the door of the outpost of Wheelers, to which Marco Pierre White has given his name, which is all but empty. And all the time he seems to be thinking, sniffing, tasting opportunities. In his efforts to coolly colonise the world, one site-sensitive neighbourhood tapas bar at a time \u2013 &quot;we are not into concepts, we are not fucking TGI Friday&apos;s&quot; \u2013 it seems he is not alone. One night, on our way between Esquina in Singapore and his bar over the road (which requires a password to enter, and in which a Buddhist cocktail impresario serves drinks in miniature wooden dhows), Atherton meets Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, another graduate of El Bulli. Andr\u00e9s is puffing on a big cigar, and also covertly looking for new opportunities. Outside 22 Ships in Hong Kong, Atherton runs into Alvin Leung, the so-called Demon Chef, who has just exported his &quot;extreme fusion&quot; cooking to London. They talk of cities not yet on the international restaurant radar, Rangoon, Bangkok, Manila. There is, Atherton suggests later as we wait for a plane, hardly a departure lounge in which he does not meet one Michelin star or another, all scenting possibilities in the global foodie air. A few days after we return, I look in on Atherton in Pollen Street Social. After the spin of the previous week he seems relieved to be grounded. Before an impeccable lunch he shows me around with pride and joy. The kitchen in which all the carrots, and everything else, are facing the right way, the dessert bar, and the Buccleuch beef ageing behind glass. Downstairs is his office, in a corner of the prepping kitchen, no bigger than a Skegness caravan bedroom. He doesn&apos;t have a PA, so he runs his mini-empire from here by email. What you&apos;ve got to remember, he says, not for the first time, is that, &quot;we are just a bunch of guys cooking food and having fun&quot;; and the thing is, he still just about believes it.

Her inquest was held last month. Married and working part-time as a financial assistant at Citizens Advice in Portsmouth, she had been left in debt over a slimming franchise. Over several months, she embezzled \u00a319,000 from her employers. It was her first offence and she received a nine-month sentence. The judge said at the time: &quot;This woman is a suicide risk and she is to be watched carefully.&quot; Melanie&apos;s death is one of 100 women&apos;s deaths in custody over the past decade. Her case will be highlighted in a report published on Monday by the charity Inquest, a free advice service for bereaved people after contentious deaths. Thirty-eight deaths have occurred since Baroness Jean Corston&apos;s ground-breaking review of vulnerable women in the prison system in 2007. Her proposals received cross-party support. They included the closure of 14 women&apos;s prisons in England by 2017 to be replaced with small custodial units closer to the prisoners&apos; homes, intensive community punishments and preventive support for women leading highly chaotic lives to prevent them from entering prison in the first place, which often results in losing children into care. &quot;The criminal justice system continues to sentence vulnerable women to custody in unsafe institutions that are ill-equipped and under-resourced to deal with their complex needs,&quot; says Deborah Coles, co-director of Inquest. &quot;Fundamental questions need to be addressed: why are demonstrably vulnerable women still being sent to prison? And why has the government not built on the Corston review?&quot; The reconviction rate for women is 58% and women in prison usually serve six months or less, convicted of non-violent crimes such as theft and handling stolen goods. Around 17,000 children a year are affected by mothers going to prison. Under the United Nations&apos; Bangkok rules and the Human Rights Act, the courts should weigh the seriousness of a woman&apos;s crime with the fact that she has dependant children. This rarely happens. Up to 80% of women in prison suffer from one or more mental health disorders linked to childhood abuse, homelessness, domestic violence and drug dependency. Self-harming is rife. As the judge acknowledged, Melanie Beswick was fragile but was still sent to a woefully inadequate prison. Poor conditions included lack of staff training, bullying, long hours of lock-up for suicidal women, punitive management of self-harming, systemic neglect of women&apos;s physical and mental health, and unsafe cells. Justice minister Helen Grant says she intends to divert more women from prison into &quot;robust&quot; and cheaper alternatives in the community. While her commitment has been welcomed, inadequate funding and the widespread lack of community alternatives, plus the privatisation of much of probation and changes to legal aid and rehabilitation, may mean more not fewer women going to prison at a huge cost to the public purse. Rachel Halford, director of the charity Women in Prison, said: &quot;The action on the ground doesn&apos;t match Helen Grant&apos;s words. At the same time, the Ministry of Justice is no longer involved in work with women at risk of offending. That&apos;s alarming.&quot; A further concern is that a review of the female penal establishment, due in the summer, may propose smaller units attached to men&apos;s prisons to bring women \u2014 often in prisons up to 100 miles away \u2014 closer to home. Baroness Corston describes this proposal as &quot;a disaster&quot;. &quot;The culture of a men&apos;s prison is very different,&quot; she said. &quot;This &apos;add on&apos; approach is setting back progress by 10 years. &quot;In New York, strong community support and early intervention mean women have a chance of turning their lives around. Prisons are emptying and crime is falling. Here, that whole strategy is at risk. Why redesign services that are shown to work?&quot; Andrew Neilson of the Howard League for Penal Reform says under the government&apos;s Transforming Rehabilitation agenda, a woman who has served a two-week prison sentence will now be on supervision for a further 12 months. Any breach of that supervision could mean a return to jail, swelling rather than reducing the prison population. The Prison Governors Association says 80% of imprisoned women could safely serve their time in the community. In Melanie&apos;s case, she was ordered on release to repay the money in six months or return to prison. She went back to prison rather than make her family homeless by selling their house for the necessary funds. The jury at her inquest found that failures in communication between the prison and the hospital, and internally in the prison, contributed to her death. Speaking from her home, Melanie&apos;s mother Margery Davies fights off the tears. &quot;She was a devout Catholic. She&apos;d never been in trouble before. Nobody knows where the money went. If she had been punished in the community, she would have worked hard to pay it all back over time and the girls would still have their mum.&quot; Mrs Davies shows Melanie&apos;s notebook of religious quotations she kept in jail. In it she wrote: &quot;I am not what I have done \u2026 but what I can do.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-06-15T23:04:21Z", "tags": ["Prisons and probation", "Law", "UK criminal justice", "Mental health", "UK news", "Women"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jun/16/vulnerable-women-still-being-jailed", "title": "Why are vulnerable women still being jailed?", "sentences": ["Under the United Nations&apos; Bangkok rules and the Human Rights Act, the courts should weigh the seriousness of a woman&apos;s crime with the fact that she has dependant children."]}, {"article": "Holger Osieck is the man For 48 hours before the game, a major Sydney road was rechristened as the Tim Cahill Expressway. This was a man who had scored his country&apos;s first ever World Cup goal and at times had dragged the team through qualification. For years, he has been the source of goals when all others had run dry. Yet with 13 minutes remaining and Australia starting to come to terms with the realisation that they may not actually secure a place at Brazil, Holger Osieck changed things around. And boy, did he make a change. In a stadium packed with more than 80,000 fans, Cahill was far from alone in looking nonplussed and annoyed to see his number up. In came Josh Kennedy. Within minutes Mark Bresciano, who did not see enough of the ball until the last quarter, sent over a perfect cross for Kennedy to head home. The striker known as Jesus may not walk on water but he does float through the air.  In the trilogy of games in June, the German really took charge of the team in the 78th minute of game three, as decisively as when Darth Vader threw the Emperor into the core of the Death Star. Osieck has turned around his reputation almost as quickly as the Vader and deserves huge credit. The criticism would have been vicious. It was a big call that took big balls. Pretty it wasn&apos;t So often was it said before the game that three points was all that mattered, and not the performance, that it perhaps became a self-fulfilling prophecy. After the game, it was, all agreed, including captain Lucas Neill, &quot;not pretty&quot;. After the spit and polish of Japan and the sparkle of Jordan this was all a bit huff and puff on a wet night in Sydney. Australia gave the ball away too easily and when chances were created, they were wasted. Brett Holman was running into dead ends, Robbie Kruse just was not able to repeat his antics of a week previously when he got behind the defence almost at will, and the two full-backs were ineffective. There were mitigating circumstances. The pitch was poor and not helped by the pouring rain. In the end though, it provided a dramatic backdrop to celebrations as Australia qualified for a third successive appearance on the global stage. Now the Socceroos are World Cup regulars. Iraq don&apos;t deserve to finish last With five teenagers in the starting XI, the average Iraq player was a full decade younger than his green and gold equivalent. Their performance was impressive \u2013 doubly so when you consider the following: they play home games away; their federation, coach (apt to change quite often) and players spend as much time arguing with each other as they do focusing on the opposition; and their two biggest stars retired just last week. And then there was the fact that they were playing in front of over 80,000 fans against a highly experienced and hugely committed opponent as well as already being eliminated. And yet Iraq showed what they were made of. After a shaky start, they started to pass their way out of defence in the first half. In the second they started to trouble Mark Schwarzer. Much more than Jordan last week, Iraq, whose players showed some delightful touches, made a game of it. In the end, their weakness in the air was punished but there was much to be pleased about. The experience will serve the players well in their Under-20 World Cup campaign next week and for much further into the future.  Australia like to leave it late Late goals have been something of a specialty for Australia. The scene was set in the third round of qualification when all but three of the 13 goals scored came in the second half but the trend intensified in the final stage. Of the 12 goals scored in these eight games, just one has come before the break and just one more has come before the hour. Seven of the 12 scored have come in the last 10 minutes. For a team supposedly full of wheezing veterans, it suggests impressive stamina levels and a determination to keep going until the end.           This was Australia&apos;s first real World Cup campaign Brazil&apos;s a hell of a long way from Asia. It is possible for an Asian nation to play 22 games in order to qualify for the World Cup and Australia&apos;s 14 almost pales into insignificance.  But while the Socceroos have not always provided inspiration, there&apos;s been plenty of perspiration. They have played in the 45 degree celsius heat of the Middle East, the humidity of Bangkok and the cauldron of Saitama in Japan. They have slogged it out on training grounds in Oman, Qatar, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Japan and Thailand. And they have sweated at home at times against opposition that have caused serious problems.  Tuesday was the culmination of almost two years on the road. And it all rested on 90 minutes in Sydney and then \u2026 45 minutes \u2026 then 20 minutes \u2026 then 15 minutes \u2026 then seven \u2026 and then it happened. And then came squeaky-bum time.

With a whole host of issues grouped under one umbrella and a variety of NGO activities (from grassroots awareness raising to lobbying policymakers on the international stage) happening across the world simultaneously, it has traditionally been very difficult for organisations to collaborate, share information or resources. These are the views of the heads of several agencies, all working to combat modern-day slavery. Dave Batstone, president of\u00a0Not For Sale, summed up the challenges and their costs, saying: &quot;Collaboration is hard work because it runs counter to an agency&apos;s instinct to think first of its own need for money and other resources. But cocooning your work in a social cause will prove even more costly because you will miss out on dynamic opportunities to grow your network and your influence.&quot; But, by their own admission, it seems that attitudes are finally changing \u2013 and there are successes to prove it. The Alliance to End Slavery and Trafficking\u00a0(Atest) is just one example of successful collaboration. The coalition is made of 12 US-based human rights organisations with anti-slavery programmes. These organisations differ significantly in size, geographical reach \u2013 and it can be assumed funding and supporter base \u2013 yet Atest has six jointly-defined policy objectives and has been praised for its work surrounding the Trafficking victims protection act. Results that might have been difficult for any one organisation to see on its own. Some within the sector are suggesting that social media can be credited, at least in part, for the rise in collaborative working. Tim Waldron, chief executive of\u00a0Love146, a UK-based anti-trafficking charity says: &quot;Social media and increasing recognition of anti-slavery and trafficking efforts by the private sector and public at large is certainly helping push this along. We&apos;re beginning to see a more strategic approach to\u00a0partnership\u00a0working, with strategic thinking that is putting collaboration at the core of more long-term planning, which are all very positive signs.&quot; So what are the lessons from successful alliances such as Atest?

Wealthier, Healthier Cities - how climate change action is giving us wealthier, healthier cities. Is the latest CDP Cities report, based on data from 110 cities around the world, really saying that climate change is having positive effects? &quot;No, we&apos;re seeing this very much as a co-benefit of climate change action&quot;, explained Claire Bonham-Carter, director of Sustainable Development at global technical and management services provider AECOM, who conducted the report analysis for CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project). &quot;It&apos;s not climate change that is giving us this, but the action that cities are taking to mitigate or adapt to it are not only helping to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or make the cities more resilient, but also they are having these other positive co-benefits.&quot; What has long been argued now has some very solid data. 110 cities is a significant increase from 73 in 2012 and 48 when the CDP Cities first reported in 2011. With the central aim of asking cities to measure and report on their GHG emissions, the survey also covers in-depth questions about the specific actions cities are taking. It is the economic side of this year&apos;s responses that prove most interesting. The cities reported over $40m (\u00a326.2m) in savings per year from tackling climate change. The vast majority, 91%, also believe that working to combat climate change will lead to economic opportunities. Conor Riffle, CDP head of cities, believes &quot;this is changing the nature of the argument from climate change being the sole driver (of emissions reduction), to saying actually if you want to be a competitive, healthier city, you have to make these changes.&quot; In addition, said Bonham-Carter, &quot;more and more cities are thinking and talking about climate change related actions in terms of job generation, cleaner air, decreased congestion, better public services, rather than GHG emissions reductions, just because it&apos;s much more tangible for people.&quot; The most popular actions cities are taking to reduce emissions are reducing energy demand in buildings, improving fuel efficiency in municipal fleets and lowering energy consumption and maintenance costs of outdoor lighting. For example Sydney will replace 6,450 conventional lights with LED technology, reducing its GHG emissions from lighting by 70% and saving the city $800,000 per year on its electricity bill. Terri Wills, director of global initiatives for the CDP&apos;s report partner C40 Cities, said the findings, &quot;help to build the political case for implementation...if cities want to pass an expensive Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) system, or like Tokyo undertake a cap-and-trade programme where they are requiring buildings to undertake energy efficiency \u2013 some of those policies get push-back...So by being able to quantify the benefits, city governments are able to bring these stakeholders along. If you go back to Tokyo, all those building owners have surpassed the initial emissions reductions requirements because in making efficiencies they discovered that they saved money too.&quot; The Greater London Authority&apos;s Matthew Pencharz, environment advisor to the Mayor of London, goes further. He said: &quot;We must fight the rhetoric that... taking climate action inevitably leads to a reduction in living standards or even a complete change in our way of life. We must say that there is no contradiction between being resource efficient and fostering economic growth and jobs... financial incentives will provide a much more persuasive message than reductions in GHG emissions.&quot; Of the 110 CDP respondents, 62% of actions taken to reduce GHG emissions have the potential to attract new business investment and grow the economy. These include, said Bonham-Carter, activities to &quot;help businesses operate more efficiently, make their buildings cheaper and easier to run. Less congestion allows their workers to get to the office more easily, they are nicer places to live and so can attract and retain the staff that they want.&quot; From London&apos;s perspective, said Matthew Pencharz, &quot;when a company wants to locate its international HQ...one of the indicators they look at is quality of life, and if we keep on improving on quality of life, for example by showing that the air quality is getting better, that&apos;s going to attract businesses. It&apos;s the same with parks and trees, green infrastructure...it&apos;s amazing how land value increases when it is a more pleasing, pleasant space.&quot; However there is a danger that all this talk of booming wealth and health masks the vast amount of work still to be done. The report also includes &quot;some sobering facts&quot;, said Bonham-Carter. &quot;98% of cities report climate change as a risk. Most of them are reporting risks from temperature increases, heat waves and storms or intense periods of rainfall. On the whole this is right now \u2013 this isn&apos;t something they are looking at for their children or grandchildren, it is current, in 2013.&quot; In New York, direct and indirect losses from Super-storm Sandy amounted to around $19bn in damages. Bangkok, Thailand, expects the economic damage of flooding to rise four-fold by 2050. &quot;An increasing number of cities are putting resiliency and adaptation plans in place \u2013 up from 63% in 2011 to 71% this year&quot;, said Bonham-Carter. &quot;San Francisco is already looking at a full triple-bottom line assessment of alternative storm infrastructure, because they are already seeing impacts of sea levels on sewer outflows.&quot; However she argues that if done well, and done now, such adaptation plans can again improve the attractiveness of a city to investors and businesses. Albeit on a smaller scale, she points to how Blackpool in the UK has utilised AECOM-designed coastal defences that also regenerated the city&apos;s public realm and sea front. A question also remains as to how far-reaching the CDP report is. Not even all the vanguard group of C40 Cities&apos; members report their GHG emissions, with 53 out of 63 currently doing so. National restrictions and ability to capture and collate the data remain barriers, explained Wills, butsaid &quot;we are actually going to roll out a protocol to give guidance to cities to say this is how you can capture and measure GHG emissions...that 53 will increase next year significantly.&quot; Meanwhile the central message of the CDP report is to be welcomed, said Matthew Pencharz: &quot;It is hard to overstate how useful reports such as (CDP Cities) are to city governments in working out how to take action... all of us working in this space must speak up clearly and say taking climate action saves money, and delivers jobs and economic growth.&quot; This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Now HIV prevalence among female sex workers is largely stable and low: an estimated 1.8% in 2011 compared to 28% in 1996. Thailand is also proving successful in reaching HIV-positive pregnant women and is on the verge of virtually eliminating mother-to-child transmission. However, the picture is less rosy for other parts of the Thai population: an estimated 39% of people who inject drugs are HIV-positive, and a 2010 survey in Bangkok found that 31% of men who have sex with men (MSM) are infected with the virus. &quot;Since the mid-1990s the Thai government has really dropped the ball quite significantly in terms of legal and policy reform and also in terms of support for people living with HIV,&quot; said Scott Berry, executive director of the HIV Foundation Thailand. &quot;According to Bangkok government figures 50% of newly diagnosed cases of HIV in Bangkok are gay men.&quot; The two high-risk populations are being targeted with large-scale projects funded by the Global Fund to Fights AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and United States Agency for International Development (USAid) . As with the much-hailed condom campaign, it is hoped that lessons learned in Thailand trying out innovative approaches to reach MSM and drug users will help neighbouring countries to tackle their own HIV epidemics more effectively. The HIV Foundation Thailand is one of the beneficiaries of USAid funding with the recently launched the Good Life Project, which reaches out to gay men, encourages them to get tested and then shepherds those who test positive through the public health system, the only source of free HIV care in the country. &quot;What we&apos;ve found when we talked to MSM is that they said they&apos;d rather wait until they were really sick before getting tested because the health system is so poor. They are treated so badly that it&apos;s simply not worth engaging with,&quot; explained Berry. &quot;We go out and talk to gay men at clinics and we guarantee support for the first three to six months. &quot;The normal model is a big bubble of testing and prevention, and within that a smaller bubble of care and support. Our project flips that around so the big bubble is care and support and testing and prevention is the smaller.&quot; Funding for the Good Life Project is provided through the USAid&apos;s US$36m CAP-3D project. The project also covers tuberculosis and malaria in Burma but $30m of the total is for HIV programmes in Burma, China, Laos and Thailand. &quot;Key populations at risk of HIV are not necessarily reached by the public health system and you need community-based groups to reach them,&quot; said Aye Aye Thwin, director of the Office of Pubic Health at USAid&apos;s regional development mission to Asia in Bangkok. Population Services International (PSI) manages the CAP-3D project, which runs from 2011 to 2016. &quot;Through groups like PSI we are involved with building the capacity of lots of local groups,&quot; said Thwin. &quot;We&apos;re finding creative and cost-effective ways to get MSM and transgenders into testing, treatment and care,&quot; explained Andrew Boner, PSI Thailand country representative and CAP-3D chief of party. Apart from projects like Good Life, PSI is also working with other members of the CAP-3D consortium, such as Save the Children on using online social networks to reach high-risk members of key populations that are not easily reached through peer-based outreach in venue settings. &quot;The highest HIV prevalence is among the general MSM population in Bangkok, and it&apos;s not necessarily transactional sex that is feeding the epidemic,&quot; said Boner. &quot;We need to find out where the high-risk behaviour is happening and encourage people to get tested. If you can catch people early and get them onto treatment then the treatment as prevention benefits kick in.&quot; PSI is also managing a $16.5 million Global Fund grant for HIV prevention among injecting drug users. The Champion-IDU programme, now in its fourth year, operates peer-led harm reduction services out of drop-in centres and offices in 19 provinces. Promoting the concept of harm reduction to law enforcement agencies is an uphill battle. The project is operating in a hostile legal environment that puts its outreach workers at the same risks as its client group, said Pascal Tanguay PSI&apos;s programme director for harm reduction. &quot;Law enforcement agencies will use needles as evidence of drug use. Anyone found with a needle can be forced to undergo a urine test. Ifit&apos;s positive, they can be forced into a compulsory drug treatment centre. If they have drugs on them, then it&apos;s straight to prison,&quot; he said. Despite these obstacles, the project has succeeded in distributing safe injecting kits directly, with outreach workers trained in how to respond when confronted by beat police officers. Kits are also distributed via commercial pharmacies participating in the Champion-IDU project using a voucher system and training for pharmacists to ensure they do not discriminate against drug users. The Champion-IDU projects holds valuable lessons for other engaged in harm reduction in a hostile environment, said Tanguay. &quot;Getting the donor to understand the situation we&apos;re working in has been critical to the project&apos;s success. The Global Fund has provided tremendous flexibility and has been very supportive, of the measures we have taken to protect our staff.&quot; The drop-in centres have also added other health services beyond those supported by the Global Fund, such as an overdose prevention to increase the attractiveness of their services to clients. He added:&quot;Clients are often more afraid of the police than they are of getting HIV. We&apos;ve been able to understand that dynamic and use it to our advantage and focus on the law enforcement challenge.&quot; This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

All over Britain, the festival \u2013 indeed the cultural \u2013 scene is changing. Last weekend I drove westwards to attend the Chalke Valley History festival. When it started, three years ago, this clever, offbeat book festival, the brain-child of former bookseller James Heneage, was confined to a marquee, a cricket pavilion, and a field in the middle of nowhere (actually, just outside Salisbury). Despite, or perhaps because of, the recession, Chalke Valley is still in the middle of nowhere, though I hear it&apos;s negotiating to come closer to civilisation next year. But, at the same time \u2013 with enhanced sponsorship, and Heneage&apos;s manic enthusiasm \u2013 it&apos;s rocking. More speakers than ever, attendances booming, and book readers from across the south-west flocking to its fluttering standard. Chalke Valley offers a mixture of books, authors, food and drink, celebrity and ideas, but its bedrock is the extraordinary boom in reading that&apos;s been detonated by the digital revolution. The age of the laptop, the iPad, and the Kindle has sponsored, among many changes, a phenomenon that can only be described as a golden age of reading. We are now consuming more print, in more formats, than ever before. Moreover, this unprecedented appetite for print is having an impact not just on literary festivals. The individual formerly known as &quot;the common reader&quot;, now enfranchised by the world wide web, has begun to demand access to the once closed world of books. Last week, in a sign of the times, the Asia-Pacific Writers and Translators Association launched a new book prize in which ordinary readers will have a dominant voice. &quot;Everyone is fed up with book prizes where professors of literature choose books which are great reads, but only for professors of literature,&quot; said Nury Vittachi, chairman of the Asia-Pacific Writers&apos; and Translators&apos; Association. &quot;What about books for the rest of us?&quot; The idea for the World Readers&apos; award came from a noisy meeting of writers and translators in Bangkok last October, when participants from all over the world, including North Korea, expressed their dismay at the unimaginative way book prize panels made predictable choices. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Vittachi and his colleagues decided to organise a prize in which the narrow format that underpins most book awards would be broken open. &quot;As the world becomes a more level playing field, the next JRR Tolkien or Ian Fleming will likely be a female from Asia,&quot; said Jane Camens, executive director of the Asia Pacific Writers and Translators Association. &quot;This prize gives her a chance.&quot; The World Readers&apos; Award will have new criteria for entry. While you need a US passport to win the Pulitzer, and a British or Commonwealth passport to win the Man Booker, judges of this new prize won&apos;t consider your nationality at all. The idea is to encourage writing set at least partly outside global literature&apos;s Anglo-American heartland. Now, this departure could be a recipe for the worst kind of literary populism. Involving ordinary readers is no guarantee that the final verdict will be &quot;better&quot;, however you choose to define that \u2013 possibly the reverse. But one thing is certain: Mr Vittachi and his co-conspirators have served notice on the literary prize world. In the golden age of the reader, Pulitzer, Booker, Costa and the rest will have to acknowledge that the borders of the literary world can no longer be policed in the traditional way.", "publicationDate": "2013-07-01T12:11:03Z", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Festivals"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/jul/01/readers-control-new-age-of-print", "title": "Readers take control in a new age of print", "sentences": ["&quot;What about books for the rest of us?&quot; The idea for the World Readers&apos; award came from a noisy meeting of writers and translators in Bangkok last October, when participants from all over the world, including North Korea, expressed their dismay at the unimaginative way book prize panels made predictable choices."]}, {"article": "&quot;Life is like playing the violin in public and learning the instrument as one goes on.&quot; Samuel Butler. Replace &quot;life&quot; with &quot;managing Manchester United&quot; and consider the daunting challenge on David Moyes&apos;s mind as he drove into Carrington on Monday morning. He may have experienced some jitters. He would have done well not to feel overwhelmed. Moyes started his first official day in charge trying to continue the dynasty built by Sir Alex Ferguson over 27 gilded years, with Wayne Rooney&apos;s future at the head of the perpetually increasing, always-morphing list of issues he is expected to control. Since being handed the job on 9 May as Ferguson&apos;s successor Moyes has been on a United crash course, attempting to gain some kind of working handle on arguably the world&apos;s biggest football club. Seven weeks before the whirl of another pre-season begins is as much any new manager of United could be granted. For this Moyes can be grateful to the executive who ensured the ending of Ferguson&apos;s reign and the start of his was handled slickly and swiftly. In this near two-month period the pressing business for Moyes has been how best to handle the unsettled Rooney before meeting him this week, assembling his own backroom staff and the decision to make an opening bid for Everton&apos;s Leighton Baines \u2013 all moves that could well have significant impact on his hopes of success. Two hours after arriving at United&apos;s training base came confirmation that Steve Round, as assistant manager, Jimmy Lumsden (coach) and Chris Woods (goalkeeping coach) have all been appointed to follow him from Everton as replacements for Mike Phelan, Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen and Eric Steele. &quot;I have worked with Steve, Chris and Jimmy for a number of years and I am delighted they have decided to join me at this great club,&quot; said Moyes. &quot;They bring great qualities in their respective fields and I know that, like me, they feel that this is a challenge to relish. I have great faith that together, we can build upon the success this club has enjoyed over many years.&quot; In ensuring he has an inner circle of trusted lieutenants Moyes states that United will be his club now, a message continued with the bid for Baines. This tells Patrice Evra his status as United&apos;s first-choice left-back is threatened, which in turn shakes up the dressing-room dynamic. The Frenchman has been the de facto captain over the past two seasons due to Nemanja Vidic&apos;s ongoing injury struggles, an important figure for Ferguson and a key shop steward for the squad. Not any more it would seem. After Moyes&apos;s opening offer of about \u00a312m for Baines was rejected, he will return with an increased bid and hope eventually to sign him. Evra now understands he may have to find a new club. Given that Vidic&apos;s future is yet to be clarified, he could be next. No fresh contract has been forthcoming for the centre-back, who will be 32 in October and has entered the final 12 months of his current deal. Contrast this with how the first transaction Moyes signed off as manager was to grant Rio Ferdinand \u2013 three years Vidic&apos;s senior \u2013 another 12 months at United. To cull the entire backroom staff plus (potentially) captain and vice-captain would send a jolt through the club and players, some of whom may already feel bemused at the Moyes approach. He is about to get a sense of whether they do. On Tuesday and Wednesday his new group start filtering back to Carrington to undergo tests to ensure they are fit enough to embark on pre-season. On Thursday he addresses them before a first training session under his guidance. Then comes a debut press conference as United&apos;s manager which, though to be confirmed, should be on Friday. There, Moyes will comprehend how much his profile has grown in the heat of an unveiling packed with journalists and TV crews and broadcast globally. Next Wednesday Moyes, his squad and the United entourage jet out on a customised plane for a three-week tour that is the longest in club history. A week on Saturday in Bangkok the Singha All Stars present the first opposition of his tenure. The tour then moves to Sydney where the A-League All Stars await on 20 July before stops in Japan (for matches versus Yokohama F Marinos and Cerezo Osaka, on 23 and 26 July) and Hong Kong (29 July to play Kitchee FC), before the squad return home. The United circus then flies back out again on 6 August to Sweden to face AIK; Ferdinand&apos;s testimonial \u2013 against Sevilla \u2013 is Moyes&apos;s first match at Old Trafford on 9 August; then two days later the 50-year-old will be desperate to win his first trophy when Wigan Athletic are the opposition in the Community Shield at Wembley before the season finally begins at Swansea City on 17 August. When Manchester City host United on 21 Septembe, Moyes will have already sent a team out to try to beat Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&apos;s Chelsea (his first home league game) and Liverpool at Anfield. That date at the Etihad Stadium can stand for the end of the first chapter of United under Moyes. Between now and then the Scot can start to understand how successful he might be in his new role. At times the demands of being manager may feel to Moyes like juggling while counting continually from 100 backwards as a marble balances on his head. If it sounds impossible that&apos;s because only the very best can pull the act off.", "publicationDate": "2013-07-01T14:21:55Z", "tags": ["Manchester United", "David Moyes", "Sport", "Football"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/jul/01/david-moyes-manchester-united", "title": "David Moyes begins Manchester United reign \u2013 and faces big decisions already | Jamie Jackson", "sentences": ["A week on Saturday in Bangkok the Singha All Stars present the first opposition of his tenure."]}, {"article": "David Moyes could meet with Wayne Rooney on Wednesday for crucial discussions over the forward&apos;s future, as the Manchester United manager speaks to his squad individually for the first time before Thursday&apos;s opening day of pre-season training. Moyes met Rooney around a month ago, before their respective summer breaks. During those talks the 27-year-old described to Moyes the reasoning for his discontent last season, pointing to how Sir Alex Ferguson played him out of position, dropped him at times, and questioned his fitness. Rooney also made clear his unhappiness at Ferguson&apos;s claim that he had asked for a transfer, which United accept he did not. Moyes and Rooney agreed to meet again after their holidays to decide the best way forward. As Moyes plans to address his squad collectively at United&apos;s Carrington training ground on Wednesday, he may see Rooney then, before the club&apos;s busy pre-season begins. On Friday Moyes may hold his first press conference as manager, though this is yet to be confirmed, before United fly to Bangkok next Wednesday to start a three-week tour that takes in Thailand, Australia, Japan and Hong Kong. With the Singha All Stars on Saturday week providing the first opposition of Moyes&apos;s tenure and a chance for him to assess his squad in match conditions, his players will be keen to impress. Rafael da Silva said: &quot;The pre-season tours are a big part of preparation work for the new season. If you play well, you can put a thought in the manager&apos;s mind and maybe change his mind if you perhaps weren&apos;t in his plans for the first few games. The tour is a great experience for the young players and the older players like Ryan Giggs and Rio Ferdinand are always really encouraging when we&apos;re away and help us a lot.&quot; Tom Cleverley believes the champions will only be stronger for the three weeks away. &quot;We have a great team spirit in the squad and I&apos;d be surprised if there is a club with a better team spirit than ours,&quot; he said. &quot;Everyone gets on and I think the tours can only help that. &quot;I&apos;ve managed to score a few goals on tour [before]. It shows the manager what you can do and the fans also get to know your name. Most of all, being away with the squad helps you become comfortable around the first-team lads. For a few weeks, you change from being a reserve-team player to a first-teamer and you feel more comfortable. &quot;As a young player it can really help your development. I don&apos;t think any game is seen as not being important at this club. There&apos;s competition for places and, not only that, the rest of the players and the staff set such high standards that you constantly have to try and meet. Every game is taken really seriously and you&apos;re always trying to impress so you give it your all.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-07-02T21:06:31Z", "tags": ["Wayne Rooney", "Manchester United", "David Moyes", "Transfer window", "Football", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jul/02/manchester-united-wayne-rooney-david-moyes", "title": "Manchester United's David Moyes and Wayne Rooney prepare for showdown", "sentences": ["On Friday Moyes may hold his first press conference as manager, though this is yet to be confirmed, before United fly to Bangkok next Wednesday to start a three-week tour that takes in Thailand, Australia, Japan and Hong Kong."]}, {"article": "For over 10 years, the Human Development Foundation \u2013 Mercy Centre&apos;s Aids hospice was the first, largest and only free Aids hospice in Bangkok, Thailand. At first, Mercy was known as a dumping ground for dying people. Then we changed our general policy and, apart from the truly indigent, only accepted patients with their relatives&apos; involvement. Over the years as the treatments improved, our hospice became a place of hope for the future where people could recover and go back to the community and their family. We learned that HIV is not about one person, it&apos;s about the whole family. We created three-way partnerships between our hospice staff, patients and their families. We asked the families to share in the hospice care of their family members, and in return, we provided counselling to the families and taught them home-care skills. The patients also agreed that they would contribute to the maintenance of the hospice as much as they were able to. It often took several months of counselling, sometimes even years, to unite families and patients and bring them home. It was rarely easy. As our home-care programme expanded, we were able to close our hospice in 2012 and now all our Aids care is done in the community. Our clients come to us through the communities, often via our 20-plus schools and kindergartens in the slums. The teachers know the whole community. We are also well-known and trusted because of our other outreach activities, including elderly care and legal aid. Government clinics, hospitals and the temples also refer people to us. Currently we care for 323 families. Every month we make over 90 visits to 50 people living with HIV. Our team comprises five homecare staff, two phone counsellors and a database manager, all of whom are people living with HIV. When we first started the home care programme in 2002, many families we visited asked: &quot;Are you HIV-positive? If not, how can you know what I&apos;m living with?&quot; In response, in 2004 we introduced a team of caregivers living with HIV. Then Family Health International and USAid got involved. FHI is very good at capacity-building and with their support we were able to develop a home-based care programme that assesses our beneficiaries&apos; physical and psychological state and ensures they have access to anti-viral medications and proper healthcare. We don&apos;t just look after a poor person who has HIV, we assess their whole family situation, what they eat, where they live, their jobs, whether they are facing discrimination, and how we can assist their partner or children. If they are anxious about going to the hospital, we go with them. We offer both practical and emotional support. By 2011 we were able to start sharing what we had learned. We&apos;d done a lot of train-the-trainer work with FHI and were keen to share our knowledge and experience of working with people living with HIV, their families and communities. Our first home-care workshop was at the Thai-Burmese border with Mae Tao Clinic in Mae Sot. We worked closely with Dr Cynthia Maung (the clinic&apos;s founder) to understand their needs and design a programme that met them. Before we conduct our workshops, we make on-site visits and evaluations. We always meet local organisations already doing HIV programmes to show our respect and ask for their assistance. In 2011, Princess Ashi Kesang Wangmo Wangchuck of Bhutan visited our Mercy Centre for two weeks to learn about our approach to HIV/Aids community-based care. Later she invited us to run a community home-based care workshop for the first HIV/Aids group in Bhutan. Since then we have also worked with Population Services International in Pattaya, Thailand to run workshops for transgender groups, and most recently with the Lao Network of People Living with HIV and Aids. Our on-site workshops are tailored to the needs of each organisation, and they are always interactive, with a lot of role-play. Then we go on home visits with participants to make sure they know how to conduct the visit and keep proper records. We help them understand that each visit needs to provide all-inclusive support \u2013 from therapeutic support for their illness to total caring within their home and family environment. Today our greatest homecare challenge remains in trying to unite patients and families. We have learned a lot from our experience, but there is still much road to travel and also much to be hopeful for.

A match report may mention the sweet smell of the freshly watered pitch as it&apos;s warmed by a sultry late-summer sun; an advert might pan across a crowd as they bounce up and down while singing their song. It&apos;s all, needless to say, an entirely disingenuous affair. That&apos;s partly because crowds are mainly silent these days, partly because the top notes of eau de Premier League are less redolent of well-manicured turf, more stale lager, soupy urine and the overwhelming stench of existential despair. But mainly it&apos;s because most of us have been sh@fted by capitalism, and we simply can&apos;t afford to attend top-flight football these days, instead condemned to spending our weekends sitting hunched in front of the computer in a string vest and suspiciously stained jeggings squinting at a dodgy feed and straining our ears so we can cobble together the West Bromwich Albion team news from Egyptian Arabic. We&apos;re pretty sure it&apos;s not just the Fiver who spends each and every weekend doing exactly that. So for those of us who consume the game solely through television, via proxy servers also loaded up with the finest premium bongo, today was an important day, as the opening tranche of live fixtures for this year&apos;s Premier League was announced. And that announcement brought bad news for Liverpool fans, whose season will be over before anyone else has even kicked a ball. They get the 2013-14 campaign started early doors on 17 August with a disappointing lunchtime draw at Anfield against Stoke City, the first match to be transmitted on the new BT Sport service, and simulcast on www.glamourandillegalsubscriptionsoccer.com. A very super Super Saturday continues over on the more established Sky Sports, who later in the evening transmit a fixture between Swansea City and Manchester United that&apos;ll also be broadcast on www.contrabandsmut.eu/bootlegfitba. The first stellar clash of the televised season comes 10 days into the new campaign as Manchester United host Chelsea on Sky (and also at www.indecencies-u-like.co.uk/flagrantcopyrightviolation), a match which will chart the beginning of David Moyes&apos;s rapid descent into raging paranoia and jabbering madness, or the beginning of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&apos;s rapid descent into raging paranoia and jabbering madness. Before then, all three promoted sides will have already had their fresh-faced phizogs on the telly: Crystal Palace hosting Tottenham Hotspur and Hull City travelling to Chelsea on the first Sunday, then Cardiff City and Manchester City putting on a joint production of The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus a week later. The big TV events keep coming thick and fast, though the Fiver doesn&apos;t have the time, room or inclination to go through every one up until December. A quick scout around on Google should bring up a comprehensive list, though be careful kids, the internet is a wild frontier containing some very dubious content; it&apos;s not all innocent stuff like live football, clips of cats and dogs peering out of toilet bowls, and retro grot.

Speaking at Bangkok&apos;s Rajamangala National Stadium where Moyes takes charge of United&apos;s opening pre-season tour match on Saturday against the Singha All Star XI, the Scot was asked about Mourinho&apos;s comments. &quot;Unless I was speaking double Dutch last week, we said Wayne Rooney is not for sale,&quot; said Moyes. Earlier Mourinho, talking at the team hotel in Bangkok where Chelsea are also embarking on their own tour, the Portuguese was asked if Rooney would become a Chelsea player this summer. &quot;It&apos;s a funny, tricky question from an ethical point of view as I can&apos;t talk about players from other teams,&quot; he said. &quot;But it is not my character to speak with hypocrisy, I always tell what I see.

I&apos;m getting asked plenty of questions about Wayne,&quot; he said. &quot;Jos\u00e9 has been asked about players as well. It&apos;s hard to keep repeating myself but I will \u2013 Wayne is a Manchester United player and it will remain that way. I think Jos\u00e9 said, in his comments, that he doesn&apos;t normally talk about other players. But it does happen.&quot; When it was put to Moyes that, as Rooney has said nothing publicly regarding his future, he should do so then the matter would close, the 50-year-old said: &quot;I think I&apos;ve covered all of the things on Wayne. I&apos;ve given you everything about his injury. What you must remember is that Manchester United is a football club and I&apos;ve got a team, and this is not about any one individual. In many ways, I&apos;m only interested in the team. I will answer questions on Wayne, but some of them are just reverting back to things I&apos;ve covered.&quot; Rooney was sent home from the tour after a scan revealed a slight tear to his hamstring, with the Liverpudlian having complained of it being tight in the final training session before United flew to Thailand. Writing on Facebook, Rooney said: &quot;Gutted to have picked up a niggling injury especially as training was going so well, heading back to Manchester to have it assessed fully but early indications are nothing to worry about.&quot; Moyes said: &quot;It&apos;s a blow that we&apos;ve lost him because he&apos;s been training well and looking very good. But unfortunately he just felt something in his hamstring. &quot;We did a check and found a slight grade one injury there, which will probably keep him out for about two to three weeks. So I don&apos;t foresee any problem with Wayne starting the season and being fit for then. &quot;He didn&apos;t train the last little bit [in Manchester]. He just felt his hamstring tighten, so we pulled him out and didn&apos;t think anything of it. It was only when we got here we knew we weren&apos;t going to train him yesterday, and we thought, as a precaution, we would check it out. &quot;When we went to check it we saw a small grade one [tear]. We could maybe have taken him on to all the other places, but he couldn&apos;t have played the games. So for the benefit of the player the best thing to do was to get him home straight away and quickly into his rehabilitation. We didn&apos;t expect it. But what would be the point in taking any risks? There&apos;s no point in taking any risks.&quot; Moyes is not concerned that Rooney, who benefits most from a hard pre-season, will lose valuable time training. &quot;Remember, when we return from this tour we&apos;ve still got games in Stockholm, Rio&apos;s testimonial and the Community Shield, so he can play in those games,&quot; the manager said. &quot;It&apos;s important we get players fit for those games. We&apos;ll keep his work up. We&apos;ll keep his work up back in Manchester. With a hamstring injury he can do lots of work in the swimming pool, some work in the gym. And I have to say he was in really good shape when he came back. He was at a good fighting weight.&quot; Moyes would not be drawn on Barcelona&apos;s Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara, to whom Bayern Munich appear to have beaten United for his signature. &quot;I never said at any time that he was [a target],&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re on with targets that we are chasing at this moment in time. At this moment in time and there are people we are actively chasing. At this moment in time we&apos;re happy with how things are going.&quot; Regarding Nemanja Vidic who is not on tour due to a back problem, Moyes said: &quot;He&apos;s doing fine. He&apos;s having an injection and he&apos;s on a course of injections to help his sciatica. If he improves then we&apos;d consider bringing him out later on. The one thing we don&apos;t want to do is make it any worse by flying him halfway around the world. So we have to consider that. Nani had an operation on his nose to clear a bit of breathing. At the moment we&apos;re not sure if flying is allowed so that&apos;s the one downside.

Wayne Rooney, who had to fly home on Thursday due to a torn hamstring, is the biggest loss, with his departure meaning that Moyes has only one recognised striker, Danny Welbeck, to choose from. Whereas Javier Hern\u00e1ndez has been given the whole tour off, Robin van Persie joins up next week in Sydney after international commitments, as does David de Gea, the first-choice goalkeeper and Antonio Valencia. Shinji Kagawa will not take part until the Japan leg of the tour, in a fortnight. Nemanja Vidic (sciatica), Nani (nose operation), Chris Smalling (foot) and Ashley Young (ankle rehabilitation) are all missing through injury. Although the Singha All Stars will not provide the sternest of opposition, Moyes recognises the disruption is not ideal. &quot;What it&apos;s going to do is give some of the younger players an opportunity to get games, some playing time,&quot; he said. &quot;Some of the missing ones have had games for their national teams. One or two are injured but not far away. The likes of Chris Smalling and Ashley Young are not too far away. &quot;[It&apos;s] my first opportunity to manage the team and it will take a little bit of time to get used to each other, but that&apos;s what the games are for. We&apos;ll try and give as many people as we can an opportunity to play. We&apos;ll see some young players as well. Obviously, we&apos;ll use all the games to prepare for the start of the season.&quot; Given the number of players missing, it will be interesting to see how Moyes sets out his first ever United team, with the Scot perhaps having to field Welbeck as a lone striker. Regarding the 22-year-old he said: &quot;I&apos;ve only seen him for a short time but I&apos;ve been impressed. He looks a very good player. A lot of the things he&apos;s done have been excellent. If we can add some goals to his tally from last year it will make a big difference. From what I&apos;ve seen so far he&apos;s an exciting player and someone I&apos;m looking forward to working with.&quot; Of his debut as manager, Moyes said: &quot;When I first got the job I was very much aware of tour of Asia and that my first game would be in Thailand. I didn&apos;t think an awful lot about it [the game] at the time but I&apos;m really excited about it now. I know the stadium has been sold out, you go see the amount of Manchester United supporters in Thailand so I&apos;m looking forward to being here and hopefully it&apos;s just the first of many games to come as being Manchester United manager.&quot; Moyes can call on Ryan Giggs, and the veteran is again excited about playing again. &quot;Things have been going great to so far and everyone is working hard. Personally, I feel good. I shut down for about three weeks after the season finished but then started going in the gym a couple of times on holiday after that and also did a bit of swimming and a few runs. I was also in Turkey doing my coaching badges with Gary [Neville], so we were training partners, which was good. &quot;I enjoyed the summer and if you compare it to last year they&apos;re like chalk and cheese. It&apos;s obviously great to win the league and you can enjoy your summer knowing you&apos;re champions, but as it goes on you&apos;re itching to get back; you want that challenge again and you can&apos;t wait for the season to start. Of course, you need that rest after a tough season but two or three weeks into your holiday you&apos;re already thinking about coming back and achieving more.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-07-13T10:11:52Z", "tags": ["Manchester United", "David Moyes", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jul/13/david-moyes-first-manchester-united-game", "title": "David Moyes faced with depleted squad for first Manchester United game", "sentences": ["David Moyes takes charge of his first game as the Manchester United manager on Saturday evening, against the Singha All Star XI in Bangkok, with the Scot forced to draw from a squad that is severely depleted by injury and rest requirements."]}, {"article": "1. No more injuries, please By the close of this defeat to the Singha All-Star XI in Bangkok the absentee list had risen to double figures as Alexander B\u00fcttner limped off to make it 10 of David Moyes&apos;s first-team squad who are either crocked or still away resting following international commitments. While the left-back has a tight hamstring and might recover soon, the manager could do without any more headaches in this department. 2. Opportunity knocks for Wilfried Zaha The flipside of so many being not available to Moyes is that a clutch of young players headed by Zaha have chance to shine. Moyes needs to see far more of Zaha as he joined up with United only on Monday but following a bright display when entering as a second-half replacement he could end this three-week marathon as a promising member of the new manager&apos;s squad. 3. Ben Amos stakes a claim as David de Gea&apos;s understudy With Anders Lindegaard&apos;s future uncertain as the Danish goalkeeper continues to consider a move away from Old Trafford, Amos was given a chance in Moyes&apos;s first outing as manager. Amos conceded the sole goal of the game but this was hardly his fault, later tweeting: &quot;Thanks to everyone who came to watch our game tonight! Happy to get a game! Shame about deflected goal but that&apos;s football! #OnToTheNextOne.&quot; The rest of his display was assured, stopping the score being greater as the Singha All Star captain, Teeratep Winothai, continually broke clear only to be repelled by Amos. 4. Danny Welbeck could use a goal The statistic the 22-year-old will use as motivation is the just two strikes he managed last season in United colours. But given that many of his appearances were as a substitute or when being fielded out of position by Sir Alex Ferguson there were mitigating circumstances. Against the All Star XI Welbeck had chances yet failed to find the finish that would have boosted his confidence.

What was the first thought that went through your mind?&quot; Not only is this a reversal of the traditional interview roles, it&apos;s also a tricky question. The film under review is Only God Forgives, the follow-up to Refn&apos;s critically acclaimed and commercially successful Drive. Imagine a Quentin Tarantino homage to oriental slasher movies but directed by David Lynch at his most elliptical and unsettling, and you might get some idea of the strangeness of Only God Forgives. It features Ryan Gosling as a boxing promoter and drug dealer with impotence issues, Kristin Scott Thomas as his blond, American psycho-mother, and some of the most horrific torture scenes committed to a cinema-release film. Like Drive, Only God Forgives is not exactly overburdened with dialogue and, like the earlier film, it also takes an unblinking approach to violence. But that&apos;s where the comparisons come to an end. Drive was an existential hymn to urban alienation LA-style, a film about a rootless getaway driver, directed by a man who doesn&apos;t drive. Only God Forgives is set in the seedier areas of Bangkok and what it lacks in plot, it makes up for in blood. Unlike Drive, which won him the 2011 best director award at Cannes, Only God Forgives was booed at the festival screening and, in many quarters, critically savaged. Sight &amp; Sound designated it the worst film shown at Cannes. And even Scott Thomas admitted that it was the type of film that she found impossible to watch. What then was my first reaction? I thought it was pretentious, slow, repetitive, sickeningly violent and absurd. But I don&apos;t tell Refn any of that for several reasons. Obviously it would be a bit of conversation stopper, and more than a little rude. The key reason, though, is that I had a similarly negative reaction to an earlier Refn film, Bronson, yet found that images from it kept revisiting me unbidden for weeks afterwards. So, while I have some sympathy with the critic for Hollywood Elsewhere, who said: &quot;I felt violated, shat upon, sedated, narcotised, appalled and bored stiff&quot;, I also have respect for the Guardian&apos;s Peter Bradshaw, whose five-star review declared that Only God Forgives was &quot;emotionally breathtaking, aesthetically brilliant&quot;. Thus I tell Refn that it left me in a state of confusion. He seems satisfied with this response, although he claims he&apos;s unbothered by harsh criticism. &quot;People have called me everything,&quot; he says with what turns out to be characteristic overstatement. &quot;Every word in the dictionary I&apos;ve been called at one point or another.&quot;     Carey Mulligan and Ryan Gosling in Drive. Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar    His manner is languorous, teasing, almost camp. He speaks English with an Americanised drawl in which he tends to stretch vowels to a point that perhaps only Loyd Grossman has previously reached. &quot;I wanted to drop the atomic baawwmb on society,&quot; he tells me, in reference to his youthful artistic nihilism. But for all the extremity of his language, there&apos;s nothing macho or intimidating about his presence. He&apos;s not one of those directors like, say, Ridley Scott or Abel Ferrara, who bristle with a threatening sense of self. When I initially meet Refn, he is being photographed in a darkly atmospheric boxing gym a few minutes&apos; walk from the Observer offices. It&apos;s not the only time he&apos;s adopted a pugilistic pose for promotional purposes. Given his track record of cinematic brutality, it&apos;s an obvious visual reference. But it also remains a striking irony, because the first thing you notice about Refn is that he&apos;s a bit of a wuss, in the nicest possible way. A few minutes into our chat, he tells me how much he loves Sylvanian Families, the tiny plastic anthropomorphic animal dolls beloved by young children. &quot;Denmark is like a Sylvanian world, but one thing it breeds is malady. The malady is generally in good taste. Opinions are correct. That is the chief enemy of creativity.&quot; His personal war on good taste began precociously early. As a child he had dyslexia and didn&apos;t learn to read until he was 13. Instead, he immersed himself in film, but not the European arthouse cinema his parents worked in. His mother was a cinematographer and his father a leading film editor in Denmark. When they split, his mother moved to New York, where Refn lived between the ages of eight and 17. It was in America that he saw The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. &quot;The only thing that would really make my mother angry would be if I liked horror movies or violence or Ronald Reagan,&quot; he recalls. &quot;And very violent films were a way for me to rebel. You have to rebel against your parents.&quot; But it was a very Scandinavian rebellion, because his parents remained utterly supportive, financing his first video efforts. In his early 20s, he turned down a place at the Danish film school to make his debut feature, Pusher, a gritty drama that brought a documentary-style immediacy to the Copenhagen drug scene.

Although the film wasn&apos;t released until 1996, Mads Mikkelsen, who launched his career in Pusher, insists that it influenced von Trier and Vinterberg. &quot;The whole Dogme concept was inspired by Pusher, even though they will never admit it,&quot; Mikkelsen has said. Refn claims to have had nothing to do with the Dogme gang, because they were film school and he was a genuine independent. But he retains a spiky rivalry with Von Trier, whom he likes to wind up at every opportunity. He has been known to read out their text messages on Danish television \u2013 in one Von Trier said that Refn would stab him in the back and take his crown. When Von Trier ran into trouble at Cannes a couple of years back for jokingly suggesting that he &quot;understood&quot; Hitler, Refn couldn&apos;t resist joining in. &quot;Everyone asked me about it and I said, &apos;Of course he&apos;s a Nazi. I&apos;m horrified. How can he say things like that?&apos; I even found a poster of The Boys from Brazil, framed it and sent it to him.&quot;           All the same, he maintains that his taunting of Von Trier is a sign of respect. &quot; I say all those things out of admiration for him as well. Because I think he&apos;s an incredible force of nature and inspiring to be around. Danish culture because of socialism and our mindset, everything is generally in good taste, except Lars. That&apos;s what I like about him.&quot; Denmark has become rather fashionable of late, partly due to the success of TV programmes such as The Killing and Borgen. But Refn has mixed feelings about his homeland. He pays homage to its magnificently efficient welfare system, its excellent state schools and hospitals. &quot;It has all those great things which from a family and moral standpoint make it one of the best places to live in the world. But not the best creatively. It&apos;s very claustrophobic.&quot; He speaks a lot about the disjunction between his moral needs and his aesthetic tastes. At one stage he even suggests that he has &quot;got a lot more conservative about violent entertainment since having children&quot;. When I say that this new conservatism hadn&apos;t appeared to cramp his style in Only God Forgives \u2013 where a scene of limb amputation is a long way from the most stomach-churning \u2013 he concedes the point, but argues that his moral self exercises little control over his aesthetic choices. &quot;It&apos;s like pornography. I&apos;m a pornographer. I make films about what arouses me. What I want to see. Very rarely to understand why I want to see it and I&apos;ve learned not to become obsessed with that part of it.&quot; It&apos;s not an answer that is likely to satisfy those critics who saw an almost misogynistic glee in the sexual brutality visited on women. Not only does Refn vacate moral responsibility for the grisly scenes he depicts, but he also compares himself to a pornographer. There&apos;s a kind of provocative flippancy in some of his replies, a punkish temptation to shock; but there&apos;s also a disarming candour, a willingness to look at himself critically. He says that experience has taught him humility. After Pusher and the equally well received Bleeder, Refn could do no wrong in Denmark. So he moved to Los Angeles to crack Hollywood. Working with the novelist Hubert Selby on a screenplay, he developed Fear X over several years and at great personal expense. But the film flopped, leaving him with large personal debts and his production company bankrupt. &quot;It was a massive failure,&quot; he says, &quot;which still haunts me to this day because it was a failure on all levels: financially, commercially, artistically, creatively, personally.&quot; He had no choice but to return to Denmark where he made two sequels to Pusher. Pusher II was semi-autobiographical insofar as Mads Mikkelsen played a film nerd. Originally Mikkelsen&apos;s character was a bit of a cool dude, but Mikkelsen complained that it was nothing like Refn. &quot;I had to talk to him,&quot; Mikkelsen has joked, &quot;and say, &apos;Listen Nic, you&apos;re not that cool. We have to take that out.&apos;&quot; He managed to make enough money out of the Pusher trilogy to pay off his debts, but it also involved him turning to hack work. He even directed an episode of Miss Marple, whose genteel pleasures one struggles to reconcile with, for example, the interaction of an eyeball and a meat skewer in Only God Forgives. &quot;Extremely degrading&quot;, is how Refn recalls the experience. &quot;But it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I got slapped around and I needed to be slapped around. Knock some sense into me. Because I realised that you can&apos;t walk on water and vanity and ego are more destructive than drugs.&quot; He says it was the transformation wrought by his failure with Fear X that made him decide to direct Bronson, a film about the long-term violent prisoner Charles Bronson (real name Michael Peterson) as a kind of autobiography. On the face of it, there seems to be little personal or experiential overlap between a slightly effete Danish film-maker and a career-criminal hard man. But Refn could see the shared theme of salvation. Both men had to accept the fact that life had consequences. In Bronson&apos;s case \u2013 he was played by Tom Hardy in the film \u2013 repeatedly beating people up, meant solitary confinement. In Refn&apos;s, believing his own myth led to bankruptcy. &quot;You cannot go through life without cause and effect,&quot; he says ruefully. It was Bronson that brought Refn to Gosling&apos;s attention. The actor was looking for a director for Drive and, impressed by Refn&apos;s work, he arranged a meeting. Unfortunately, Refn had flu and was feeling upset because he&apos;d been unable to persuade Harrison Ford that his character should die in a thriller they were planning to work on. After an awkward dinner, Gosling drove Refn home in a tensely silent car journey. But then REO Speedwagon&apos;s I Can&apos;t Fight This Feeling Anymore came on the radio and Gosling began singing. Suddenly Refn announced that he knew how to make the film. Gosling had to be a taciturn loner. From that moment a collaborative friendship grew. Refn is reluctant to talk about it, presumably because he doesn&apos;t want to run the risk of saying anything that might jeopardise an important, as well as lucrative, relationship. &quot;We&apos;re very similar in many ways,&quot; he says. &quot;We have shared values and understanding. We&apos;re both mama&apos;s boys. We both worship women as goddessses. We like electronic music.&quot; He says that he has worked with the three best actors in the world. &quot;I went from Mads Mikkelsen to Tom Hardy to Ryan Gosling. Those are the three best male leads.&quot;     Kristin Scott Thomas in Only God Forgives. Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar    He clearly elicits a strong sense of loyalty from the actors he works closely with. But I wonder if Gosling will stick around if Only God Forgives bombs and the reviews are less than favourable. Had he given Refn any feedback on the film? &quot;Oh yeah,&quot; he drawls. &quot;He likes these kinds of films. He likes this kind of cinema. And he&apos;s a very brave actor who makes very interesting choices. He goes against all conventions. I have a lot of affection for him.&quot; Refn also seems to have an affection for Kristin Scott Thomas and Carey Mulligan, both British actors who have appeared in his films. He calls Scott Thomas &quot;KST&quot;. Cast against type, she&apos;s the best thing in Only God Forgives, delivering a performance that&apos;s both disturbing and darkly amusing. He didn&apos;t think she would be interested in the part, but then he flew to Paris and had dinner with her. &quot;I very quickly realised that this woman has no problem turning on the bitch switch,&quot; he says, giving me a look as if to suggest he&apos;s pretty dexterous himself with that particular switch. As for Mulligan, who appeared opposite Gosling in Drive, he wants to cast her in a thriller or a horror film. &quot;I think she needs to be slapped around a little bit,&quot; he says. &quot;I don&apos;t mean physically, but mentally. She&apos;s up for it.&quot; Originally he was not interested in casting her in Drive, because he thought she &quot;was a bit chubby, a bit fat. So I was like, why meet her?&quot; Mulligan, a veritable waif, fat? What was he thinking? But he says he changed his mind after 10 seconds in her company. &quot;First of all, she was extremely beautiful and petite and I realised she had what I was looking for, which is I want to protect her. That&apos;s what I have with Liv my wife, I want to protect. Drive is about a man who protects purity. Drive was about needing to show the love and devotion I have for my wife.&quot; Given that Drive is also about beating the shit out of people who threaten that &quot;purity&quot;, it&apos;s perhaps a revealing statement. He&apos;s been with his wife for 17 years. She is, he says, the only girlfriend he&apos;s ever had. You get a sense of Refn as a man who uses film to act out his personal fantasies and fetishes. That gives his work a distinctive edge but it also leads to some weird places that are not always reconcilable with old-fashioned ideas such as narrative cohesion and character motivation. Never has that conflict been starker or more polarising than in Only God Forgives. The good news for the kind of Gosling fans that see the actor as some sort of feminist icon is that the next project Refn plans with him won&apos;t involve the slaughter or sexual exploitation of women. &quot;We agreed, having done these films back to back, that what we need to do next is a comedy with a lot of talking.&quot; Refn doing a romcom. Now that might turn out to be the strangest of all his films.

The barking dogs. The hovering helicopter. The crack of splintered wood as the metal &quot;enforcer&quot; smashes its way into the villa. The garish four-poster bed. The hidden pistol. The bolted &quot;panic room&quot;. Yes, it must be the latest flashy crime procedural to hit our screens, wearing all its cliches as proudly as a freshly inked tattoo. But no, this film was made by the Spanish police and it showed  the arrest last weekend of a fugitive British criminal. Mark Lilley, aka &quot;Fatboy&quot;, &quot;Mandy&quot; and &quot;Big Vern&quot;, a 41-year-old drug dealer from Merseyside, was arrested after more than 12 years on the run. The whole operation, from the scaling of the front gates of his villa in Alhaur\u00edn de la Torre near M\u00e1laga, to the exposure of his en suite lair, was captured on film. Although trained in the Brazilian martial art of vale tudo (which means &quot;anything goes&quot;), and guarded by three large dogs, Lilley went quietly. The arrest came two months after another Briton on the run, Andrew Moran, was grabbed by his pool in Calpe on Spain&apos;s Costa Blanca. That arrest was also filmed, although Moran disobligingly spoiled his close-up by vaulting over a wall and pulling his T-shirt over his head before he was finally caught. He had escaped four years earlier from Burnley crown court, where he was convicted in his absence of conspiring to commit armed robbery. Lilley was the 51st criminal on the 65-strong Operation Captura wanted list \u2013 drawn up by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) \u2013 to have his collar felt on the Costas. But to some it seems strange that British criminals still opt for Spanish hideaways. Have they never seen Sexy Beast? &quot;The attraction for Spain is still there, as there is a huge expat British population,&quot; said Dave Allen, head of the fugitives unit at Soca. But there are other European options. &quot;The language is not too much of an issue in the Netherlands either \u2013 the Dutch speak very good English and are culturally similar to the British, so it&apos;s easy to fit in.&quot; But some are now looking further afield: &quot;The places we&apos;re seeing them go to now are Thailand, certainly, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates.&quot; He said that 133 fugitives were arrested abroad at the request of the UK last year. &quot;The people we put on the Crimestoppers website \u2013 it&apos;s not a top 10 &apos;most wanted&apos; list; that&apos;s an American thing \u2013 are the ones seen to be the most dangerous. They are wanted for violent crimes, predatory sex offences and the like.&quot; The arrests of Lilley and Moran represent something of a coup for Soca, helped by the fact that they were filmed and thus received maximum publicity. Another high-profile fugitive was apprehended in Athens on the same day as Lilley, but the Greek police did not film it, so it received less coverage. Kevin Hanley, from Fulham, west London, wanted in connection with drug dealing, was caught as he tucked into sausage, eggs and soda bread in front of the Lions v Wallabies game at Molly Malone&apos;s pub in the suburb of Glyfada. The police knew he was a rugby fan and had staked out the limited number of places in Athens where the big game could be watched. Jason Coghlan, a former armed robber from Manchester who served time with Lilley as a category A prisoner in Strangeways, now runs a Marbella law firm, JaCogLaw, which advises ex-pats who are in trouble with the authorities. Its website boasts an impressive series of quotations from Aristotle to Gladstone, although the one probably most likely to catch the eye of potential clients is from 18th-century jurist William Blackstone: &quot;Better that 10 guilty men escape justice than that one innocent man goes to prison.&quot; Coghlan, who is setting up a similar outfit in Bangkok, thinks that Spain is a daft place to hide. &quot;If you&apos;re a villain on the run in Spain, you&apos;re just in a queue waiting to get nicked. What a lot of them don&apos;t realise is that the Spanish police can even trace where your emails are coming from. Being on the run is no life \u2013 and it&apos;s no life for the family of someone on the run. Some of them think that, with the passage of time, their sentences will be reduced. But the sentences don&apos;t go away.&quot; He said that if he were on the run himself, he would probably head for eastern Europe, either Albania or Romania. &quot;A lot of the armed robbers come to Spain because they can go into drug smuggling \u2013 it&apos;s the number one place, not just because of the hashish from Morocco but because of cocaine coming in from Mexico.&quot; Coghlan said he thought the tip-offs that led to the arrests of Britons generally came not from sharp-eyed members of the public but from other members of the underground: &quot;If someone throws their weight around and makes a nuisance of themselves, that might lead to a tip-off.&quot; And he&apos;s sceptical about the idea of villains now having a panic room along with the pool and the four-poster. &quot;I think that was just a hidey-hole \u2013 people call it a panic room because of the film.&quot; But take a virtual stroll through the English-language estate agents&apos; websites in Spain and you will be amazed how many homes offer &quot;bullet-proof glass&quot; as a special feature along with the spa bath and barbecue area. In a brief window between 1978 and 1985 when extradition agreements between Spain and the UK broke down, a number of wanted men settled on the &quot;Costa del Crime&quot;. Ronnie Knight, the former husband of Barbara Windsor, is credited with establishing Spain as a getaway destination. But his Costa days are over; he now lives in sheltered accommodation near Cambridge and told magistrates, when he was charged with drink-driving last year, that he mainly uses his car to help fellow residents with their shopping. The Spanish authorities are less tolerant these days of the expat criminals who land on their doorstep: there were 1,599 arrests of Britons there last year. But by no means all of them are on a par with the likes of Lilley and Moran. &quot;Most of the foreign nationals arrested in Spain don&apos;t fit the stereotype of the &apos;Mr Big&apos; of the crime world,&quot; said Jago Russell of UK charity Fair Trials International. &quot;Many of the dozens of people we help each year are arrested for minor crimes, and many of these are ultimately cleared, often after months or years in pre-trial detention.&quot; Another charity, Prisoners Abroad, which looks after Britons held overseas, says Spain is top of its list in Europe, with 95 clients there. So if not Spain, where? Turkish-occupied Northern Cyprus, which has no extradition arrangement with the UK because it is not recognised as a country, became popular for a while \u2013 as Asil Nadir&apos;s long exile showed. But last year Soca launched Operation Zygos, which covers the whole of island, with nine fugitives in its sights. The northern government now stresses that it does not want to become a haven for Brits fleeing justice. Lee Murray, the half-Moroccan cage-fighter and ringleader of the gang that stole \u00a353m cash from a Securitas depot in Kent in 2006, headed for Morocco when he fled, holing up in Rabat with another member of his gang. But he ignored the first rule for criminals on the run: blend in. The locals thought the pair must be gay, because it was so unusual for single men to be living together, and this attracted attention which eventually led to their arrests. Murray also could not resist splashing his money around. As Howard Sounes describes it, in Heist, his book about the crime, his villa was furnished with &quot;cream leather sofas, an elephant tusk lamp-stand, a harp-shaped bookshelf and gold chairs in the shape of giant sea shells.&quot; Thailand remains a popular criminal hideout. Bogus identity documents are easy to come by, corruption is still rife and, just like Spain, it provides the prerequisites for the Brit-on-the-run: full English breakfast, access to satellite coverage of the Premier League, and sunshine. One final tip for runaways, apart from avoiding televised rugby matches in Greece: get rid of the tattoos. One of those recently nabbed in Spain had a tattoo of a pit bull terrier and the motto &quot;only the strong survive&quot;.

Now, despite United going down 1-0 to the Singha All Star XI in their opening pre-season tour game in Bangkok, Giggs is enthused about his career progression and youngsters headed by Wilfried Zaha, Adnan Januzaj and Jesse Lingard, who were the brightest lights here in the Rajamangala National Stadium. &quot;I am excited. Adnan did well \u2013 he looks a really good prospect,&quot; said Giggs of the 18-year-old Belgian debutant who stepped into the injured Wayne Rooney&apos;s No10 berth and sparkled with his quick feet and willingness to find space before fading in the sultry heat after the interval. &quot;He has trained with us quite a bit in pre-season and did well again. Now it is just about having that experience and learning from the older players and doing what he does best. You don&apos;t want to get ahead of yourself. He is only young.&quot; With Moyes shepherding a squad that has an absentee list which could rise to 10 following the tight hamstring suffered by Alexander Buttner in the opening period, the chance to shine was also seized by Zaha and Lingard, both 20, when they came on alongside Phil Jones on 63 minutes. Giggs said: &quot;Wilfried came on and was unlucky not to score and Jesse got some shots off as well. It was good experience for these lads to come on the tour, play in front of big crowds and get that experience. All the players I mentioned, not just Wilfried, are tremendous prospects. They are all exciting and will gain experience from games like this.&quot; Zaha&apos;s shot came back off Narit Taweekul&apos;s right-hand post after the winger had smoothly made space for his left boot to unload. Giggs has not yet reached a fortnight as Moyes&apos;s on-field lieutenant but already the 39-year-old&apos;s eyes have been opened. &quot;It has worked well so far. I am excited about it personally. It is about getting the balancing act right because I am still playing. I have enjoyed it so far,&quot; he said. &quot;Regarding coaching, the manager likes to coach. There is Jim Lumsden, Steve Round, Phil Neville. There is not a big emphasis on that [for me] at the moment. It is looking behind the scenes and seeing how everything works. I am enjoying it so far. &quot;It is completely different from playing. Even though I have been playing for 20-odd years you are seeing the other side of it. You are seeing how you prepare for games. It is something I had not experienced as a player. Some things I knew, others I didn&apos;t. It has been a real education.&quot; A 65,000 sell-out crowd filled almost completely with fans in United red saw Teeratep Winothai&apos;s 50th-minute strike consign Moyes&apos;s team to a defeat in their inaugural outing. But as Giggs, who operated alongside Michael Carrick in central midfield in United&apos;s familiar 4-2-3-1, said: &quot;It is about more than the result. We trained quite hard [on Friday]. You have to give credit to the team we played. They were good tonight. The result is disappointing but we are building for four or five weeks&apos; time. &quot;It is always good to get the first game out of the way. We have had all the travelling. I have had 10 hours&apos; sleep over the last three days. It is always good to get it out of the way. We will be better for it.&quot; So, too, Zaha, making his debut after starting training with the club only last Monday. &quot;It was an incredible feeling really, to come on and play with the likes of Rio [Ferdinand], Ryan Giggs, Anderson \u2013 knowing I was on the pitch with them was good enough for me,&quot; he said. Of the strike that came close to making it a dream start, Zaha said: &quot;I really just put my head down and tried to connect with the ball properly. It would have been a different story if it had gone in. I&apos;m glad I had a go and it would have been a great day for me if I&apos;d scored one.

With Rooney not for sale and Woodward insisting there are no plans to open contract talks despite the England international entering the last two years of a deal that pays \u00a3250,000 a week, Moyes urged Rooney to prove his worth. &quot;Wayne can play up on his own, he can play dropped in. Overall my thought on Wayne is, if for any reason we had an injury to Robin van Persie, we&apos;ll need him,&quot; said Moyes, speaking in Bangkok before United flew to Sydney for the next leg of their tour. &quot;I want to be able to play the two of them, I want to use Danny Welbeck and Javier Hern\u00e1ndez as well. I want to give myself as many options as possible.&quot; As reported in the Observer last week, United are relaxed about Rooney not signing a new deal. Woodward said: &quot;There are no contract renewals that are being discussed. I am not sitting down with any player on an extension and there is no trigger date in the diary.

Maybe in a year&apos;s time we might have to look at something else. The first year, I have to get a chance to see the players and how best to use them.

There was brighter news for United as Van Persie joined up with the squad in Sydney, along with the goalkeeper David de Gea. Smalling had a first operation in May that left him on crutches, though it is thought the second surgery was relatively minor, with Moyes stating that the 23-year-old is back in light training. &quot;You&apos;re always likely to pick up one or two knocks and niggles,&quot; he said, speaking at Sydney&apos;s Museum of Contemporary Art. &quot;But we&apos;ve got players who are starting some training back home in the UK. Ashley Young&apos;s started some training, Chris Smalling has started some light training and Nemanja Vidic [who has sciatica] has started. So we do know that if we do need them we can probably call on them. &quot;My preference was to come with a smaller squad because I wanted to make sure I got as many players playing minutes as possible. I didn&apos;t want to bring players who would travel halfway around the world for three weeks and end up not playing enough games.&quot; Regarding Van Persie, Moyes said: &quot;Fortunately, Robin will join us here in Sydney, which will help us a lot.

Speaking in Sydney, where United have begun a seven-day training camp as part of their pre-season tour, Carrick said: &quot;This week, it&apos;s important because then we go on to quite a bit of flying after that \u2013 it&apos;s huge the start of the season we have.

By then David Moyes will have had his most intense spell with his new squad since taking over, with the players having undergone a full training session on Monday. Moyes was very much in the middle of the session, an approach that differs to his predecessor, Sir Alex Ferguson. &quot;The tour has been really good so far and there is a great atmosphere around the place,&quot; Carrick said. &quot;The manager has brought that in. He&apos;s enthusiastic and energetic and intense with his work, and that&apos;s rubbed off on everyone. Training has been good and there is a huge focus and a good feel around the place. I&apos;m looking forward to this week especially, it&apos;s a big week really [for] training, because without the flying this week we&apos;ve got a bit of time to prepare and get the work in. &quot;The actual training itself, there&apos;s only so many things you can do, and variations of playing football in that respect. The manager is hands-on in training. He&apos;s a lot different to Sir Alex in that sense \u2013 he tended to take a step back and let the coaches deal with it, whereas David Moyes tends to be right in the thick of it, which is good.

Moyes has identified the need for two midfielders, at least one of whom must be able to contribute goals, which F\u00e1bregas has proved he can do in the Premier League when at his former club, Arsenal. Fellaini also has an eye for goal; he scored 12 times for Everton last season. Moyes considered Real Madrid&apos;s Luka Modric before deciding on lodging an official offer for the former Arsenal captain. The deal hinges on whether Barcelona \u2013 who purchased the player from Arsenal for \u20ac29m (\u00a325m) in 2011 \u2013 are willing to sell. Arsenal have a first-option clause on F\u00e1bregas should Barcelona make him available but this depends on him wanting to return there, which is unlikely. Publicly Barcelona have maintained the midfielder is not for sale \u2013 &quot;the player is not transferable,&quot; a source said \u2013 but any indication that they would consider allowing him to leave would force F\u00e1bregas&apos;s hand as it would be clear that he is not considered central to the plans of Tito Vilanova, the Barcelona coach. However the news of United&apos;s bid came as a surprise to F\u00e1bregas, so the player&apos;s thoughts are not yet known. Moyes has turned his attention to the 26-year-old after Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara joined Bayern Munich from Barcelona for \u00a321.6m. Yet it is thought that Moyes could have signed Thiago over the course of the past weeks, with the delay in his finally leaving for Bayern being down to United&apos;s manager not being completely convinced by the 22-year-old. Although it is understood Thiago was keen on joining United, there were suggestions from some at the club that he might struggle on occasion to cope with the physicality of the Premier League. Last month F\u00e1bregas said he wanted to stay at Camp Nou. &quot;I&apos;ve always said that I&apos;m happy at Bar\u00e7a. Whoever says that I&apos;m leaving doesn&apos;t know me and has never spoken with me,&quot; he said. &quot;Nor with my agent, because he knows that I don&apos;t want him to talk with other people about me. I&apos;m very private and I don&apos;t even talk about these things with my family. If someone says anything that isn&apos;t that I want to play at Bar\u00e7a, it&apos;s completely absurd.&quot; As first reported in the Guardian two months ago Moyes has long retained an interest in Fellaini, the Belgian he took to Goodison Park in 2008 for \u00a315m from Standard Li\u00e8ge. Although no official bid has yet been made, the 25-year-old falls into the category of being is a genuine option for Moyes, who is now considering returning to his old club with an offer. Fellaini, whose contract runs until 2016, has a release clause of around \u00a323m and a portion of any fee received by Everton would have to be paid to Li\u00e8ge. It is thought the release clause expires in mid-August. Although Fellaini is far from the finished article, Moyes believes if he were to move to United he could become a high-class operator. The 6ft 4in Belgian would offer a physical presence currently lacking in United&apos;s midfield and, having operated in a deep-lying position and further advanced, is also versatile. As with F\u00e1bregas, Fellaini carries a goal threat from midfield, an area the Scot is keen to address. Following Everton&apos;s first pre-season tour game, a 2-1 defeat by Austria Vienna in which Fellaini was captain for the second half, Roberto Mart\u00ednez, the manager, talked up the prospect of him remaining at the club. &quot;He&apos;s still a very young man but I am really looking forward to seeing Marouane working hard and making sure that he sets really good standards,&quot; he said. &quot;Marouane is an international footballer and he&apos;s going to be involved, if all goes well, in a World Cup next year.&quot; Adnan Januzaj, United&apos;s 18-year-old attacking midfielder, is in talks with the club over a fresh contract, with the Belgian attracting interest from Barcelona and Juventus. Januzaj was United&apos;s stand-out player in the first half of Saturday&apos;s 1-0 defeat by the Singha All Star XI in the club&apos;s opening pre-season tour game in Bangkok, before he faded. Moyes&apos;s predecessor, Sir Alex Ferguson, initiated the discussions with Januzaj, who was signed from Anderlecht two summers ago.

Arsenal have already seen a \u00a330m inquiry knocked back and are preparing an improved \u00a335m offer for the prolific striker.

And when I see Terry, Cole, Lampard, the way they are working at 32, 32, 35, it&apos;s easy for me to control the group and demand the same from the other guys.

And, because they know me, from the first day they never questioned that situation and just worked hard. It&apos;s good for me because they are ready, all of them.

Yet any signing would apparently not jeopardise Fernando Torres&apos; standing with the manager reluctant to part with any of his senior squad. &quot;First of all I don&apos;t want the club to sell,&quot; he said. &quot;We are very much on board and connected, me and the board and the owner, and we don&apos;t need to sell players. We are happy with the group we have. We are not on this market pressure. If something happens it will happen naturally but we are in a position where we are not worried.&quot; He intends to tweak his favoured 4-3-3 formation for particular matches, occasionally using two defensive-minded deep-lying midfielders while retaining the flexibility to be more expansive. Juan Mata \u2013 who is still on leave along with Torres, C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, Mikel John Obi, David Luiz and Oscar \u2013 could operate as a playmaker or even be utilised on the right of an attacking three behind a forward, though the manager admitted he needed &quot;to get to know him better&quot;. &quot;We will play 4-2-3-1 in the first game, my favourite system, though sometimes I change the triangle and play with one in front of the defenders and two players up,&quot; Mourinho said. &quot;Other times I play with double midfielders and a No10. This is a team where we have not one or two but three or four players who like very much to be a No10: [Kevin] De Bruyne likes it, Oscar likes it, Mata likes it, [Eden] Hazard likes it. It is a natural system for all these players to play. &quot;But in another match I could change it. If we are losing, we might need to have two pure strikers. It is something we will work on because I would like to have this capacity to have it ready to play, independent of the players we have. Naturally, we will have four at the back and in my team, the attackers are attackers. Some guys say we play 4-2-3-1, blah blah blah blah, and sometimes the attackers have a defensive job so it is more like 4-5-1. But it is not 4-5-1, it is 4-3-3. &quot;With Mata, I need to get to know him better. I like sometimes to play with what I call &apos;wingers with the wrong foot&apos; \u2013 right-footed men on the left and left-footed men on the right. He is the only left-footed player we have when we want to play with a winger on the right side, but the competition is hard. We will have Schurrle, De Bruyne, Mata, Oscar, Hazard and Moses for these three positions and so we have many more options than Chelsea had in the last year. These are crucial positions for me. I like these players to play with high intensity so to have five players for three positions is, I think, brilliant for me.

With it being understood that Rooney had long-standing issues with Sir Alex Ferguson, the Scot&apos;s predecessor, and now Moyes over their stance regarding his fallen status, there seems little way back for the striker at United. According to sources close to the player, Rooney is fuming after Moyes stated that &quot;overall my thought on Wayne is, if for any reason we had an injury to Robin van Persie, we&apos;ll need him&quot;, with the 27-year-old also unhappy at statements from Ed Woodward, the executive vice-president. Rooney has entered the final two years of his contract but Woodward said that United would not &quot;be afraid to run a contract down&quot;. United refused to comment on Rooney&apos;s anger, though their official position remains that he is not for sale. Despite that, the remark from Woodward effectively signalled that serious offers for the England international would be considered this summer as the club&apos;s policy is always to open talks on a new deal for anyone in the Liverpudlian&apos;s contractual situation to protect that player&apos;s value. Chelsea head the list of potential destinations. Arsenal are the only club to have made a formal bid but Rooney would hope to join a team that would seriously challenge for honours so he may yet move abroad, where Paris Saint-Germain retain an interest. According to the sources, Rooney believes he is at the peak of his career and is clear that he will not countenance becoming a squad player under Moyes which would allow his career to slide in the season in which England hope to qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Rooney&apos;s further view, it is understood, is that he has nothing to prove at United after nine successful years there but feels he has now been put on trial by Moyes. This comes after the Scot said: &quot;It&apos;s going to be a time to see how I work with Wayne. Maybe in a year&apos;s time we might have to look at something else. The first year I have to get a chance to see the players and how best to use them. I&apos;ve got to ensure it&apos;s not just him and we don&apos;t concentrate on him. Manchester United isn&apos;t about Wayne; Manchester United is about the team, the club.&quot; All this moved Rooney to call Moyes this week to let him know his discontent at the manager&apos;s and Woodward&apos;s stance. With Rooney&apos;s long-running unhappiness with Ferguson followed by this schism with Moyes and the club, it would be a major surprise if he plays for United again. Rooney&apos;s issues at United derive in part from last season when Ferguson failed to select him regularly, played him out of position and then stated the forward had made a transfer request. United now accept the latter did not happen but the claim from Ferguson has left Rooney particularly unhappy. Neither United nor Rooney are currently willing to voice publicly that he will leave. For the club this is because they wish to retain his highest transfer price, while Rooney does not wish to concede any bonuses or other monies by making a formal transfer request. Yet each party&apos;s desire to move on means pragmatism will ultimately reign and Rooney is almost certain to depart before the end of the summer transfer window. Chelsea&apos;s interest was signalled again by their manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, in Bangkok on Friday. He said: &quot;He&apos;s a player that I like very much. Being fast and direct I like him very much but he&apos;s a Manchester United player.&quot; Mourinho has subsequently sent another clear message to Rooney in a BBC interview, saying: &quot;If Wayne is second-choice at Man United, then the national team will be affected.&quot; One stumbling block may be whether Moyes would want to sell to a serious rival and face the prospect of a reinvigorated Rooney preventing United from retaining the title in the Scot&apos;s debut season as manager. Barcelona, meanwhile, are willing to sell Cesc F\u00e1bregas to United because the Spanish champions need the money, according to a highly placed source in Spain. Although United have yet to hear back from Barcelona regarding their \u00a326m bid, they believe F\u00e1bregas wants to leave Camp Nou owing to a number of factors that have made the midfielder discontented since joining from Arsenal in the summer of 2011.

That would appeal to the Arsenal manager&apos;s innate sense of financial prudence. It would not, however, appeal to the club&apos;s supporters or some of the players, who want to see a statement signing this summer. Giroud was the big buy last time out, even though at \u00a313m from Montpellier, he has come to feel relatively cheap in terms of the figures being touted for Luis Su\u00e1rez, Wayne Rooney and Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, Arsenal&apos;s three current striker targets. Giroud was generally solid in his debut Premier League season; sometimes outstanding, sometimes frustrating. His 17-goal return was respectable. There is the hope that he could improve this season. He was outstanding here, as Arsenal created a piece of history by becoming the first Premier League team to play in Vietnam. His first-half hat-trick bristled with the kind of instinctive and ruthless finishing that everybody connected to the club craves. His second was the most eye-catching, thumped into the top corner after an assured first touch and the third was an ice-cool dink over the goalkeeper when one-on-one. Yet the quality of the opposing defence, or the lack of it, had to be considered. Arsenal overwhelmed Vietnam in the second-half, with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain sweeping home a fine shot into the far top corner; the young striker Chuba Akpom showing composure for his goals and Ignasi Miquel shooting through a crowd for seven. It was, though, to Vietnam&apos;s credit that they continued to fight and Tran Manh Dung&apos;s close-range finish sparked wild scenes in the sold-out crowd. Even Wenger said he enjoyed the reaction to the goal. It was unfortunate that Dong was booked for removing his shirt in the celebrations. There was also a late red card for the home goalkeeper Tran Buu Ngoc, who handled outside his area when confronted by Jack Wilshere, who got his first pre-season action as a 67th-minute substitute. Wenger had started with a stronger line-up than the eleven he had selected in Jakarta for the 7-0 win over the Indonesia Dream Team against opponents who were the Vietnamese national team in all but name. The game&apos;s authorities frown upon club versus country friendlies and so a little semantic wriggling has been required on behalf of the hosts. The opposition in such pre-season matches must be carefully chosen, balancing the need for them to provide a competitive workout but nothing that might cross any line into the risk of injuries. There was a brief scare when Kieran Gibbs twisted awkwardly on his way down in the first-half and held his lower back but he was able to continue without treatment.     Arsenal's Olivier Giroud, right, on the way to a first-half hat-trick during a friendly against a Vietnam XI in Hanoi. Photograph: Luong Thai Linh/EPA    The bottom line is that Arsenal do not want to be losing fixtures early in their preparations. They noted the defeat that David Moyes suffered in Bangkok in his first match in charge of Manchester United and it is not the sort of hiccup they could entertain, however trivial it might appear. Vietnam were a much tidier team than their Indonesian counterparts and the home crowd got behind them, willing them to inflict some famous damage. But no team at any level can defend like they did. This was an occasion that will be remembered by the 40,000 crowd, which revelled in Mexican waves and every forward thrust from their team. The Arsenal defence, in which Bacary Sagna started at centre-half, was tested in the first-half. Giroud made his mark in the early running. He had scored upon his second-half introduction in Jakarta and once again wasted little time, taking a pass from the busy Tomas Rosicky and shooting into the far corner. Vietnam carried the game to Arsenal in the first half, but Wenger&apos;s team had the chances and might have led before Giroud completed his hat-trick just before the interval. Lukas Podolski tricked past two defenders only to pass rather than shoot and he also shuddered the far post after being played in by Rosicky. From the rebound, Oxlade-Chamberlain&apos;s shot was cleared off the line.

His voice remains hushed, his words whispered through the kind of broad grin that lifts any mood, with the tree trunk legs and barrel chest still such a daunting obstacle to intimidate any opponent. &quot;My style hasn&apos;t changed,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m still the same. When you bump into me you can tell I am still as strong as before.&quot; Cleiton Silva, a Brazilian striker at Tero Sasana, discovered as much when guesting for Singha All Stars on Wednesday, the forward&apos;s body presumably still as bruised now as his ego. Yet bouncing a journeyman striker to the turf in a pre-season friendly in Bangkok is one thing; convincing all-comers he is the same dynamic presence who can thrive in the Premier League once again is quite another. Essien has not played for Chelsea in a competitive fixture since the final game of the 2011-12 campaign and even that was a meaningless victory over relegated Blackburn Rovers claimed by a shadow team with Bayern Munich in mind. A player who had once felt so integral watched the Champions League final six days later from the substitutes&apos; bench, his game undermined by three cruel knee injuries suffered in four years. The cruciate and medial ligaments had been shredded in his left leg in separate twists, the anterior cruciate in his right leg going the same way in virtually the first training session overseen by Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas two years ago. His successor, Roberto Di Matteo, clearly doubted Essien would be the same powerhouse of a player ever again and, as his team prepared to take on Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in last season&apos;s Uefa SuperCup, loaned him to Real Madrid for the season. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho still refers to the player as his &quot;son&quot;, Essien returning the compliment in Malaysia on Thursday by calling Chelsea&apos;s returning manager &quot;Daddy&quot;. The pair have been doing that for years. Each finds reassurance in the other&apos;s presence. Essien will go into the new campaign a two-times Premier League title winner who once cost \u00a324m with a point to prove and a reputation to restore. There were times last season, when Chelsea were short of numbers in central midfield with Oriol Romeu crocked and David Luiz thrust up out of defence, when the logic in loaning out the 30-year-old felt as flimsy as his medical history. He ended up featuring in 20 Primera Liga games and seven times in the Champions League, filling in everywhere from central midfield to left- and right-back. His was admittedly a tidy rather than explosive presence but he offered Mourinho familiarity as well as an ally in increasingly difficult times. &quot;He&apos;s a great man, he is loyal to me, he is loyal to Chelsea, he was loyal to Madrid, he is loyal to everybody,&quot; said the manager. &quot;He is a great man, a very good player and I see him now with special motivation. He went to Madrid because he was in a difficult situation here. He recovered his happiness and condition and played very important matches there, in Champions League semi-finals and finals in the Copa del Rey, and to a good level. We all know that he is not a 20-year-old boy any more, and we know the injuries were difficult for him, but he&apos;s the kind of player that will benefit a squad of many, many talented kids. He has big experience so he will be useful for us. He gives us balance and I know Michael better than anybody else.&quot; The game at the Rajamangala national stadium was no real occasion to judge whether the recovery is nearing completion but Essien was aggressive in the tackle, energetic at each end of the pitch and gave his markers a buffeting. The key question, inevitably, centred on those knees. &quot;They are fine now,&quot; he said. &quot;They are not giving me any problems. When you have injuries like those three it&apos;s hard to get back into a rhythm: I&apos;ve had eight or nine operations on my knees now. I never thought I should stop playing \u2013 it never crossed my mind \u2013 but you just relax then start working hard to come back. &quot;I don&apos;t know if people gave up on me but I never had any fear. I don&apos;t have doubts when it comes to my career. I know that, wherever I go, I&apos;ll be happy. You&apos;ll never see me sad and I even enjoyed my time with the physios and the doctors, always kept smiling. I have two years left on my contract at Chelsea and we&apos;ll see what happens.&quot; That takes an optimistic outlook to new outlandish levels but the sentiment is clear. Essien is not one for defeatism. It was heartening to see him back on Thursday, operating in partnership with Ramires and offering his team-mate \u2013 a younger model in all but frame \u2013 opportunities to spring upfield in attack. &quot;Going out on loan was a great thing for him, to enjoy a great season with Real Madrid after the unlucky injuries,&quot; said Petr Cech. &quot;That loan made sure he played more than he could have played [for Chelsea] and, as you can see, he seems to be back to the real Michael Essien. That&apos;s thanks to the fact he&apos;s fit. It&apos;s the only secret because he&apos;s always been a fantastic player and the only unlucky things were the injuries.&quot; Cleiton would verify, at the very least, that the strength of old remains. The Brazilian had been flattened and sent sprawling over the touchline, Mourinho holding out a hand to haul the All Stars&apos; player back to his feet. &quot;He had hit the wall,&quot; said the manager.

We lost in Thailand the other day and Manchester United have to win every game we play in.

Following last weekend&apos;s 1-0 defeat to Singha All Stars in Bangkok in Moyes&apos;s inaugural outing in charge, the goal settled his side down, and with Wilfried Zaha starting sharp, United were slicker, quicker and more incisive as the contest unfolded. Welbeck, who previously finished in a United shirt on 13 February at Real Madrid, was the man with his side&apos;s second. This time Lingard found Ryan Giggs, whose weighted pass was slotted confidently by the striker beyond Ante Covic. As with last weekend&apos;s defeat, United were vulnerable to being turned. An illustration came when Besart Berisha fed Thomas Broich in a move that too easily split the tourists&apos; defence. The forward&apos;s shot missed Anders Lindegaard&apos;s goal by mere inches, flying beyond the Dane and over. Within moments of the second half starting, this time Berisha was the player clear though he could only spoon an effort from the left that went close to being a throw-in on the other side. United had switched off. Berisha, an Albanian, was allowed too much room by Michael Keane, who had replaced Rio Ferdinand at half-time, and he rolled the finish beyond Lindegaard who should have got closer to the ball. Lingard, who hails from Warrington and is yet to make a senior appearance, quickly restored United&apos;s two-goal cushion with a piledriver that flew past Michael Theo, on for Covic at the break, from the angle on the left. On 63 minutes and after taking instructions from Phil Neville, one of Moyes&apos;s coaches, Robin van Persie entered, having joined the tour in Sydney. It was the Dutchman&apos;s corner that was placed perfectly on Welbeck&apos;s head as he doubled his tally for the evening before a bumper 83,127 crowd. Van Persie, on whom much depends when United begin their title defence, offered one flash of his brilliance, twisting to make room inside the All Stars&apos; area to play in Anderson but the Brazilian was offside. The Dutchman made no mistake as the match neared 90 minutes. After being put clean through he dawdled and appeared to have missed the chance to score. But when the ball was returned to him, the striker&apos;s lesser-trusted right boot did the business. Zaha closed the game with some dancing feet that should have allowed Adnan Januzaj to make it 6-1 but from near-in he missed.

Lukaku, who spent last season on loan at West Bromwich Albion, scoring 17 goals, followed up his match-winning penalty in last week&apos;s victory over Singha All Stars in Bangkok with another reward and assist in the 4-1 win over a Malaysian XI on Sunday. The 19-year-old had initially envisaged spending the forthcoming campaign gaining experience via regular football elsewhere in the division but Mourinho has since made it clear he wishes to retain the forward in spite of his on-going pursuit of Manchester United&apos;s Wayne Rooney. The teenager has started each of the pre-season games to date \u2013 Demba Ba will begin against an Indonesian XI in Jakarta on Thursday \u2013 with Mourinho encouraged by his desire to learn. &quot;Lukaku had a fantastic manager last season but Steve [Clarke] is Steve, I am me and West Brom is not Chelsea,&quot; said the Portuguese. &quot;It&apos;s up to the kid but he&apos;s open and intelligent to learn the kind of movement we want. &quot;The role he played tonight was the right movement. We don&apos;t want the striker just aiming between the central defenders but making movements, sometimes between the midfield or moving wide. People compare him to Didier Drogba but we have to respect Didier, because he is unique in Chelsea&apos;s history, and we have to respect Lukaku. The best way to do that is not compare him to a legend in Chelsea&apos;s history. Leave Didier where he is, at the top of Chelsea&apos;s history, and leave Lukaku to work hard. The kid is good.&quot; Chelsea&apos;s interest in Rooney is maintained and an improved offer is to be lodged at around \u00a325m, though there is an acceptance they may have to be patient to secure the player, particularly with Chelsea due to play at United on 26 August. Asked if Lukaku could challenge Fernando Torres for a starting place, regardless of the Rooney situation, Mourinho merely added: &quot;Of course.&quot; Another Belgian hoping to be in contention against Hull on 18 August is the midfielder Kevin de Bruyne, who hurt his right knee while volleying Chelsea&apos;s second goal against the Malaysians. The \u00a38m signing from Genk left the field on a stretcher with the club doctor in close attendance but he was able to hobble back to the dug-out in the second half. He will be assessed again on Monday \u2013 the team travel to Jakarta 24 hours later \u2013 but will remain with the touring party and expects to return to training later in the week. &quot;When he was on the floor and asking for a change, everyone on the bench thought the worst,&quot; said Mourinho. &quot;The first assessment by the doctor is that it&apos;s not ligaments, that&apos;s for sure, and if it&apos;s something in the meniscus it has to be a very small injury. So we believe it&apos;s not an important injury. Hopefully it isn&apos;t because the kid is a fantastic player and showing match after match, and in training, that he&apos;s going to be a key man on the pitch.&quot; Chelsea&apos;s other goals were scored by Victor Moses and Bertrand Traor\u00e9, the latter a 17-year-old triallist who will sign a professional deal at the club when he turns 18. Chelsea have been unable to secure the eight-time Burkina Faso international on a professional deal up to now because he holds only a student visa, despite spending a similar six-week period on trial at Cobham last season. He will most likely then be loaned out to a club in Europe with Chelsea unlikely to be granted a work permit to continue his footballing education in England. &quot;Those are the rules in England and we have to accept them,&quot; Mourinho said. &quot;They have justification. Now we want to keep him. We&apos;ll have to wait until he becomes 18 to try to get the permit for him to stay in England. If it&apos;s not possible we have to let him go on loan somewhere but we have the guarantee that he plays for his national team. &quot;For a 17-year-old boy, sooner or later, the committee has to give him a permit to play in England. If he goes on loan somewhere, he has to go but, if he&apos;s playing for his country at the same time \u2013 one of the most important countries in African football \u2013 he&apos;ll get his deserved permit. So no dramas with it.

David Moyes also had to swallow a second defeat from those games when Jin Hanato created the later winner for Yoshihito Fujita, who slotted calmly past David de Gea. Kagawa, who joined up with United this week in his homeland, had drawn a roar from the sold-out venue of the 2002 World Cup final when racing clear following his entrance. But it faded as he spooned the shot straight at Yuji Rokutan. It was that kind of evening for Moyes&apos;s new side, with 27 seconds all Yokohama F-Marinos needed to make the champions look soporific, and the score 1-0. From the kick-off United managed a few touches but when the ball came to Marquinhos, the Brazilian forced De Gea into an excellent save from a 25-yard bullet. The striker continued into the area and was rewarded with a second opportunity, from which he allowed De Gea no chance. Perhaps affected by a muggy heat that felt as stifling as in Bangkok when United went down to the Singha All Stars, rhythm was awry. A further factor to consider was that in De Gea, Robin van Persie, Patrice Evra, Jonny Evans, Tom Cleverley and Phil Jones, the Scot started with only six A-listers, the remainder of the XI a fringe player \u2013 Anderson \u2013 and young hopefuls Adnan Januzaj, F\u00e1bio da Silva, Wilfried Zaha and Jesse Lingard. Yokohama might have doubled their lead soon after Marquinhos&apos;s opener. Januzaj, asked to play behind Van Persie, had to head off the line from a corner delivered by Shunsuke Nakamura. Later, Marquinhos drew another fine save from De Gea, who this time used his legs. By half-time United led 2-1 but were fortunate to hold the advantage. Before Lingard&apos;s equaliser on 19 minutes, only a missed Evans header from a Cleverley corner posed a threat. Lingard, who scored twice in Saturday&apos;s 5-1 win over the A-League All Stars in Sydney, added his third of the tour thanks to Zaha. The winger skipped down the right then played the ball towards Lingard. Masakazu Tashiro&apos;s block came back to the 20-year-old who made no mistake. It was a Tashiro own goal that handed United the lead. Januzaj floated in a free-kick from the left and in the mix-up the central defender turned the ball home. At the break Van Persie was replaced by Danny Welbeck who would overrun the ball when clear in on Rotan. Before that sequence the J-League champions of 2004 drew level, F\u00e1bio heading home from a 50th-minute corner.

Until injury time Liverpool led by a solitary goal, scored by Steven Gerrard in the 32nd minute. The second \u2013 a tap-in by summer signing Iago Aspas \u2013 did not arrive until the final seconds and much to the delight of the majority of the 95,446 spectators it was Luis Su\u00e1rez who served it up on a platter. A day after Arsenal put in a second bid \u2013 \u00a340m plus \u00a31 \u2013 for his services, Su\u00e1rez, playing his first match for Liverpool since biting Chelsea&apos;s Branislav Ivanovic&apos;s arm in April, played an 18-minute cameo, and in that brief period he linked well with Aspas. But the game appeared set to end 1-0 before the Uruguayan slipped his man on the byline then threaded a ball to the feet of the Spaniard. It was the highlight of a rather pedestrian second half. In the 66th minute, sections of the crowd had begun chanting: &quot;We want Su\u00e1rez,&quot; and in the 72nd minute the Liverpool manager, Brendan Rodgers, obliged, sending the Uruguayan forward on, along with nine other substitutes. With some of Victory&apos;s best players either injured or, such as Archie Thompson and Mark Milligan, on duty with the Socceroos at the East Asian Cup, there was a feeling before the match that Victory \u2013 still 11 weeks away\u00a0from the start of the A-League season \u2013 would be exposed by the Premier League side. But, amid an overwhelming sea of red in the stands, it hardly played out that way once the game began, and to their credit, Victory&apos;s back four played high up the pitch, and the Melbourne side, through the midfielder Billy Celeski, often found space down the centre of Liverpool&apos;s midfield. For the first 20 minutes both sides had been content to pass and probe without any real menace, with the only decent chance falling to the busy and threatening Raheem Sterling in the sixth minute, following a long ball from Gerrard. But, pressured by Jason Geria, Sterling&apos;s first-time shot looped wide of the right hand post. Liverpool then had a scare in the 10th minute when the Victory winger Connor Pain forced his way to the byline before cutting back dangerously, only for Liverpool to clear. Ten minutes later the Victory forward Andrew Nabbout drifted inside Andre Wisdom and forced a diving save from Brad Jones. Content to sit back until this point, Gerrard fired a warning shot from outside the penalty area moments later, which Nathan Coe pushed wide. That was to prove a warning sign, as Liverpool opened the scoring with Gerrard&apos;s goal shortly afterwards. A clever dummy from the Liverpool captain in the centre of the pitch allowed the ball to run to Joe Allen, who dribbled to the edge of the area before squaring for an unmarked Gerrard to shoot low to the keeper&apos;s left. Liverpool dominated possession for the remainder of the half, Gerrard going close again after Jordon Ibe, scooting down the right flank, turned Leigh Broxham inside out and his cross was parried by Coe, but the skipper&apos;s hurried volley sailed wide. Though his team struggled at times, Rodgers was happy with Liverpool&apos;s win, saying they were tactically sound and showed &quot;lots of moments of quality&quot;. Rodgers also praised Melbourne Victory and their coach, Ange Postecoglou, saying they had a similar footballing ethos. &quot;They can be very proud of what they put on tonight. [The singing of] You&apos;ll Never Walk Alone at the beginning was a real tear-jerker. There&apos;s not many clubs in the world can do what we&apos;ve done in the last week or so. Over 80,000 in Jakarta, over 90,000 here. &quot;It&apos;s a day that hopefully many of the supporters over here in Australia will never forget.&quot; Liverpool will now travel to Bangkok for the final match of their international tour.

More mature. Less combustible. A manager with responsibilities who, it seemed, had been affected by that tempestuous departure from Real Madrid. It is worth reserving definitive judgment for a while \u2013 this is the same man who had claimed to be &quot;the mellow one&quot; back in Los Angeles in 2007 only for his relationship with Roman Abramovich to disintegrate two months later \u2013 but, at least before competition exposes the streetfighter in him, early signs suggest he is re-energised and enjoying life. Mourinho has been a breath of fresh air on this tour. His energy and enthusiasm have been infectious, his excitement obvious at the prospect of a different kind of challenge this time around: working with a largely youthful squad to mould them into something special, all long-term vision combined with a recognition things must be won in the short term. &quot;It&apos;s a different job, a different profile,&quot; he had said. &quot;Probably leadership has to be different too. I am enjoying it. After three years at Real Madrid, this profile of job comes at a good moment for me.&quot; Mourinho has been jovial on the training pitch. He creased up in fits of laughter back in Bangkok when one of his staff produced a lightning detector as the humidity built, the manager spying his colleague&apos;s baffled expression as he pawed at the device and asked why he had brought a breathalyser out on to the turf. He has strolled around the training pitch with a cone on his head, and suggested a journalist who mentioned &quot;the forbidden word&quot; (Rooney) should go and stand facing the wall &quot;for two minutes&quot; in mock disgrace. The notion that he might now be a Godfather figure in the Premier League, as the only European Cup winner and one of only two managers in the top flight who have won the title, seemed to leave him rather tickled, yet he intends to embrace the &quot;responsibility&quot; that his position brings him. This is not the same scowling Mourinho who departed the club so abruptly six years ago after a 1-1 home draw with Rosenborg in the Champions League. Admittedly, things may change once the adrenaline kicks in but the early signs are promising. He continues to massage the egos of his key players, and everything about Mourinho, with his assistants Silvino Louro a calming influence at his side and Rui Faria an enforcer if required, suggests he is a man at home again. This feels far more than a marriage of convenience. 2 The Rooney pursuit is likely to prove protracted Chelsea&apos;s desire to secure Wayne Rooney from Manchester United was exposed for the world to see as the team prepared for their game against the Singha All Stars in Bangkok. News of their bid leaked and the Premier League champions have insisted that the England forward will not be permitted to leave. A second bid will be made to test that resolve, although Chelsea may choose to time that submission either after the player has handed in a written transfer request, or once United have secured a replacement. But the offer will come and there is an increasing belief behind the scenes at Chelsea that Rooney will be their player when the transfer window closes on 2 September. He is apparently their sole remaining target, a player to complete the jigsaw and a different kind of forward to those already at the club. Fernando Torres&apos;s forte is charging into space behind defenders. Romelu Lukaku is strong, quick but raw. Demba Ba has always felt like a stop-gap. None of that trio, Mourinho believes, would naturally thrive when defenders are tight and seek to suffocate. &quot;That quality they don&apos;t have,&quot; he said. &quot;I will work on it with them.&quot; The implication was Rooney might provide that pedigree. There will be issues to resolve in the weeks ahead. Torres is due to join the squad at Cobham on Sunday before they fly to the United States next week for a four-match tour. The Spain striker will want to know where he stands given Mourinho is unlikely to want to play two out-and-out forwards regularly. Lukaku and Ba, too, will be anxious for first-team football. All must be appeased somehow to maintain harmony even though Rooney, if they are successful, would surely be first choice. Chelsea visit United on 26 August, David Moyes&apos; first home fixture in charge of the champions. If a deal is to be struck, it seems logical it may not be completed until after that occasion. Chelsea may have to wait to complete their strengthening. 3 The manager&apos;s system offers some flexibility Those players who have been at the club over the past few years will be readily familiar with the formation Mourinho will implement. The Portuguese will play varieties of 4-3-3, sometimes using two defensive midfielders in the centre to shield his back line, sometimes using only one and asking those on either side \u2013 it was Marco van Ginkel and Ramires off Nathaniel Chalobah in Jakarta \u2013 to bustle upfield in support of the attack. The intrigue lies less in his deep-lying midfield but in the composition of the three free-spirited players he utilises when 4-3-3 becomes 4-2-3-1. Last year&apos;s initial plan, under Roberto Di Matteo, had been to use Eden Hazard, Juan Mata and Oscar in those roles. Rafael Ben\u00edtez, aware that Chelsea could be rendered defensively vulnerable with all three mavericks in the team, often opted for Victor Moses or even Ramires in one of the slots. Mourinho has already pointed to Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle \u2013 an \u00a318.7m signing who will expect to play \u2013 and Kevin De Bruyne as contenders, the latter having impressed here until injury curtailed his tour. All will be craving the No10 role enjoyed, largely, by Mata last season but each may actually end up featuring on the flank. Indeed, the Spaniard may be destined for the right wing as Mourinho asks his wide men to cut inside on to their stronger foot. &quot;I need to get to know him better,&quot; said the manager of Mata, another one of the six players granted extra time off after the Confederations Cup and who will report back on Sunday. &quot;I like sometimes to play with what I like to call wingers with the wrong foot \u2013 right-footed men on the left and left-footed men on the right. He is the only left-footed player we have when we want to play with a winger on the right side, so I will play him there.&quot; Theirs is a relationship that has still to be gauged. 4 But the kids do look decent ... The games played in Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta were, as Mourinho stressed, merely public training sessions for Chelsea, opportunities to build up fitness after the short summer break even if an opportunity to instil that &quot;winning culture&quot; of which the management had spoken was to be grasped. Yet, even against substandard opponents, there were players on the tour who were desperate to make their mark, and some did. De Bruyne was arguably the most impressive performer in Bangkok, drifting from centre to the wings and conjuring clever passes en route. The Belgian enjoyed a productive spell on loan at Werder Bremen last season and has been told he has a role to play in the campaign ahead. First impressions suggest he has the quality to make waves. Certainly, his understanding with Hazard and, in particular, Lukaku seems well established. The battering ram of a striker scored in all three games and is already demonstrating better vision and understanding of where he should be making his runs. Centre-backs will be bullied in the season ahead, but so might opposing full-backs and even those in central midfield. Lukaku returned to Chelsea a player encouraged by an excellent season under Steve Clarke at West Bromwich Albion and will be anxious to secure a place in Belgium&apos;s World Cup squad for next summer&apos;s tournament in Brazil. He will feature, with Mourinho having already suggested he would have no qualms about flinging the teenager into the fray for the opening fixture against Hull City, when Torres may still be jet-lagged having played a midweek friendly for Spain in Ecuador. Van Ginkel, too, has been a steadying influence in midfield, albeit with the odd wild challenge thrown in, and offered glimpses of his huge promise. He will benefit from working alongside Frank Lampard and Michael Essien this season, experienced campaigners eager to pass on their knowledge to the next generation. Others will have to wait for their chance. Chalobah has played in defence and midfield on the tour, impressing in the latter role, but will spend the season out on loan, most likely at another Premier League club. Josh McEachran will also make a temporary move, while Bertrand Traor\u00e9 and Wallace \u2013 each of whom having shown flashes of excellence in the Far East, with Traor\u00e9 a revelation \u2013 will need to find loan moves to European clubs with neither likely to secure a work permit to play in England. Islam Feruz will drop back into the Under-21s, and Jamal Blackman will spend the season as a No3 goalkeeper behind Petr Cech and Mark Schwarzer. That, in itself, will be an education for the youngster. 5 Economics take precedence over practicalities on these pre-season tours These summer schleps around the Far East have become the norm these days. Chelsea joined Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool in hopping around the region, the quartet playing in Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Japan between them. Sunderland, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City are in Hong Kong at the moment playing in the Barclays Asia Trophy, with these all being exercises in growing the brand. The pitches have not been great \u2013 Lampard&apos;s achilles was not risked at any of the venues \u2013 and the humidity stifling, but the Asia market made up 50% of the most recent overseas television deal struck by the Premier League, worth more than \u00a31.4bn last season alone. Those figures will keep rising, and there is the motivation to visit. All this must understandably feel rather alien to the rank and file back in the Matthew Harding upper or Shed end, but in an age of financial fair play, these revenue streams may be critical. Chelsea continue to engage and lay roots with their new fan base in distant lands \u2013 &quot;Here to play, here to stay&quot; was the tour logo \u2013 with the Blue Pitches laid in Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur soon to be followed by one in Jakarta. There have been open training and signing sessions, the players mobbed wherever they go, with the stadia nearly always full and replica shirts out in abundance. The atmosphere in Jakarta where 80,106 crammed into the Gelora Bung Karno stadium was deafening, as it had been for Liverpool&apos;s visit. This still feels like an opportunity, and it is one this club is taking. &quot;Chelsea is a big club that wants to be even bigger,&quot; said Mourinho on arrival in Indonesia. &quot;You can&apos;t do that by just winning trophies. One of the things is you need a big fan base. One of the reasons Chelsea travels a lot this pre-season is that objective. We must feed the passion we feel that is growing up around this club. I was here in 2004. I&apos;m back in 2013 and this is great fun for me, and provokes some pride too, to feel the differences in this club&apos;s evolution here.

Su\u00e1rez held talks over his future with the Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers and the chief executive Ian Ayre on Thursday. The club&apos;s refusal to discuss how the meeting went has been interpreted by Arsenal as a positive sign for them. If Su\u00e1rez had indicated any willingness to stay at Anfield, then Liverpool would have been expected to publicise it. Arsenal&apos;s strategy when they made their second offer for Su\u00e1rez of one pound over \u00a340m on Tuesday was to put pressure on a clause in the Uruguayan&apos;s contract, which they were led to believe would permit him to open negotiations with them and, effectively, force the player&apos;s hand. They would love to see him agitate for the move, although a written transfer request may be too much for them to hope for. Liverpool have refused to confirm whether Su\u00e1rez asked to speak to Arsenal in the talks with Rodgers and Ayre since the \u00a340,000,001 offer was received and rejected. However, they remain adamant that the disputed clause in Su\u00e1rez&apos;s contract does not allow him to meet or open negotiations with Arsenal now that a bid of more than \u00a340m has been made. Liverpool have not granted Su\u00e1rez permission to speak to Arsenal officials. The clause in the contract he signed last August, they insist, entitles Su\u00e1rez to be informed of any bid over \u00a340m and for Liverpool to enter into discussions over his transfer should they wish to do so. Arsenal, whose opening offer for Su\u00e1rez was worth \u00a330m plus \u00a35m in add-ons, are now ready to go higher, as they seek what would be a stunning coup. They have never previously paid more than \u00a315m for a player. They are aware, though, that Liverpool will not countenance Su\u00e1rez&apos;s sale unless there is a bid of more than \u00a350m. Su\u00e1rez scored 30 goals in Rodgers&apos; debut season in charge and Liverpool&apos;s hopes of returning to the Champions League rest on him. Real Madrid continue to lurk in the background, and they have indicated to Su\u00e1rez&apos;s representatives that they have an interest in signing him. Their bank balance has been boosted by the \u00a332m that they received from Napoli for the striker Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, who was previously a target for Arsenal. Arsenal, though, believe that they are in the driving seat for Su\u00e1rez as Real are preoccupied by their pursuit of the Tottenham Hotspur winger Gareth Bale. Tottenham maintain that Bale is not for sale.

The club are hoping to sign the teenager, a revelation on the side&apos;s pre-season tour of south-east Asia, on his 18th birthday in September. Traor\u00e9 was introduced as a substitute in the matches in Bangkok and Jakarta, and started the victory over Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur, scoring accomplished goals in the last two games. The club had taken him on the tour as a triallist, at least the second such spell he has enjoyed with Chelsea in the last two years. The 17-year-old has apparently been in the United Kingdom on a student visa and it is unclear when that visa is due to expire. Under Fifa regulations Traor\u00e9 cannot sign a professional deal until 6 September, when he turns 18, though Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has already indicated that the player, a full Burkina Faso international with eight caps, may still fail to secure a work permit. This means he will most likely have to be loaned to a club on the continent in the hope that clearance can be gained in the future. His regular appearances for his country, with Burkina Faso ranked 42nd in the world, suggest he might eventually meet the work permit criteria. The concern at the south-west London club is that a foreign rival \u2013 potentially one in France where his elder brother Alain, a French passport holder, plays for Lorient \u2013 who are not hamstrung by the same stringent work permit restrictions \u2013 could offer the teenager a deal in September and fast-track him immediately into their first team. Certainly, a crowd of over 80,000 were dazzled by his display in Jakarta. Chelsea will hope the faith they have shown in the player, not least by selecting him for the three-match tour, will persuade Traor\u00e9 to remain with them even if he has to seek a loan move elsewhere for at least a season. Mourinho had been shown DVD footage of the attacking midfielder playing in friendly fixtures at the club&apos;s youth academy last season and decided on the basis of those clips alone that the youngster, who made his full international debut in a friendly against Equatorial Guinea three days before his 16th birthday in 2011, should travel with the seniors to Thailand. His form on the tour justified that faith, with a smartly taken goal against Malaysia being followed by an exquisitely curled reward in Jakarta on Thursday. &quot;He&apos;s been working well with the manager for two weeks and scored a fantastic goal,&quot; said the centre-half Gary Cahill. &quot;He&apos;s composed on the ball and has great confidence for such a young lad. &quot;I don&apos;t know the ins and outs of his situation, but he&apos;s certainly done himself no harm in the two weeks we were in the Far East. It&apos;s too early to say he&apos;s ready to do this and that, and we don&apos;t want to get carried away, but he&apos;s certainly not looked out of place in training alongside some top international players. He&apos;s slotted in nicely. He&apos;s a young lad, but I&apos;m sure he&apos;s got a bright future at Chelsea.&quot; While Traor\u00e9 has not been permitted to feature in competitive fixtures during his time at Cobham, the London club&apos;s interest in his services is long-standing. There were reports in 2009 that the midfielder, aged 14, had alerted Chelsea scouts to his abilities while playing at the Under-17s World Cup in Nigeria. Manchester United and Marseille were also linked with moves for the Burkinab\u00e9. The Burkina Faso sports minister had announced in August 2010, clearly somewhat prematurely, that the player would be joining Chelsea. Traor\u00e9 was subsequently quoted in local media enthusing about the welcome afforded him by Didier Drogba and Salomon Kalou at the club in September 2011. &quot;They have taken me into their little group and we all speak French together,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;They are always there to offer me advice, and they treat me like a younger brother.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-07-26T22:00:01Z", "tags": ["Chelsea", "Football", "Transfer window", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jul/26/chelsea-bertrand-traore-sign", "title": "Chelsea eager to harness obvious talents of young Bertrand Traor\u00e9", "sentences": ["Traor\u00e9 was introduced as a substitute in the matches in Bangkok and Jakarta, and started the victory over Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur, scoring accomplished goals in the last two games."]}, {"article": "Traor\u00e9 Chelsea   Chelsea face an anxious wait to discover whether they will be able to secure Bertrand Traor\u00e9 on a full-time professional contract, with the club hoping to sign the teenager, a revelation on the side&apos;s pre-season tour of the Far East, on his 18th birthday in September.

Julian&apos;s vile crime-lord mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) arrives seeking vengeance, arrayed in all the lurid vestments of the Real Housewives Of Miami Vice, and berates Julian endlessly on matters of cock size and spinelessness. Here, the movie briefly rouses itself from its soporific torpor \u2013 picture Penelope Keith locked inside Caligula \u2013 but thereafter falls back like a predictable recidivist into the sin of tedium, which I cannot forgive; never mind what God thinks.            Those who encountered Refn through his hyper-stylised LA thriller Drive might bridle at Only God Forgives, whose fugue-state narrative style, amnesiac and futureless, has more in common with Valhalla Rising, the hallucinatory but only intermittently engaging Viking movie he made before Drive (though parts of it were magnificent, including Gary Lewis&apos;s Scottish pagan talking of the barbaric Christians: &quot;They eat their own god; eat his flesh, drink his blood. Abominable!&quot;). And Only God Forgives is dedicated to Argentinian director Alejandro Jodorowsky, whose 1970 acid-western-cum-vision-quest El Topo offered the direct inspiration for Valhalla Rising. The result is akin to Gaspar No\u00e9&apos;s simultaneously brilliant and moronic Enter The Void or Harmony Korine&apos;s candy-coloured Spring Breakers, filtered through way-out-easterns like Pollack and Schrader&apos;s The Yakuza or Terence Young&apos;s Red Sun. Which may be the problem with Refn: I feel the ghosts of other movies \u2013 his influences, his inspirations \u2013 crowding in on his own work, suffocating him, and somehow leaving less of him on screen.", "publicationDate": "2013-07-29T05:00:00Z", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Nicolas Winding Refn", "Ryan Gosling", "Kristin Scott Thomas"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/29/patterson-only-god-forgives", "title": "Only God Forgives this level of tedium", "sentences": ["Somewhere in here is a story that Refn can hardly be bothered to tell: the psychotic brother of Bangkok-dwelling American Julian (Ryan Gosling) murders a girl, is murdered for it in his turn by the girl&apos;s father, who is acting reluctantly under the aegis of a karaoke-loving samurai-cop (Vithaya Pansringarm), an angel of vengeance figure who then subtracts arm number one from the father as punishment for pimping out his late daughter."]}, {"article": "Only God Forgives is a 2013 French-Danish co-production crime thriller film written and directed by Nicolas Winding Refn.

With United yet to make a major signing this summer, Moyes&apos;s first business in the transfer market may involve losing a player rather than acquiring one. Monaco&apos;s sporting director, Vadim Vasilyev, claimed in the French newspaper L&apos;Equipe that the Portuguese winger, who was not on the tour because of a nose operation, &quot;has been offered to us&quot;. Vasilyev added: &quot;He is a very good player but at the moment there have been no talks. We have already changed our group quite a bit and we also want to offer opportunities to our young players.&quot; Nani has only a year left on his contract and Moyes is yet to have the chance to assess his worth, which will happen when the squad return to their Carrington training base this week. Regarding F\u00e1bregas, Woodward flew back to Europe early from Sydney during the second leg of the tour, with the pursuit of F\u00e1bregas high on his agenda. With Moyes leading the squad on the 21-day trip, this week will be a first chance for the manager to give the potential purchase of F\u00e1bregas his complete focus. Following the win over Kitchee in United&apos;s final pre-season tour game, Moyes was asked if Woodward had made any progress on F\u00e1bregas. &quot;No. I&apos;ve got no other updates to report just now,&quot; he said. With Barcelona rejecting \u00a326m and \u00a330m bids and stating categorically that the former Arsenal captain is not for sale whatever the price, Moyes is taking encouragement from the knowledge that F\u00e1bregas is open to the move. Moyes and Woodward will consider whether to make a third bid, which is likely to be in the region of \u00a335m, while F\u00e1bregas also has the option of putting in an official transfer request to try to force his way out of the club. But, given that Barcelona are his boyhood team, that is not thought to be a ploy he is likely to utilise.     The French club Monaco have claimed that they were offered the chance to sign Nani from Manchester United.  Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian    The goalkeeper David De Gea has an injured finger that could make him a doubt for United&apos;s next friendly, the trip to AIK in Stockholm on 6 August, and he was rested for the game against Kitchee. &quot;David De Gea has got a finger [problem], so we just didn&apos;t risk him in the last games,&quot; said the manager, who a month into succeeding Sir Alex Ferguson is beginning to settle in. &quot;I&apos;m a bit more relaxed because of being around the players and them getting to know me and I think they&apos;ll feel a wee bit the same way, a new manager coming in, and I&apos;ve enjoyed being with them,&quot; he said. &quot;They&apos;ve been really good to work with and I think the work we&apos;ve asked them to do has been very good. &quot;They were already very good players. I&apos;m just taking on the baton and keeping it going, if I can. &quot;This was going to be a daunting job for anyone who takes it. For whoever was going to replace Sir Alex it was going to be a hard task. So it was always going to be daunting but certainly you grow into it and, as the days go on, you start to feel a bit more comfortable.&quot; After stops in Bangkok, Sydney, Tokyo, Osaka and Hong Kong Moyes conceded that the tour was not the best preparation for the title defence. &quot;I don&apos;t know if it would be ideal preparation. I don&apos;t think it is what every team would certainly choose,&quot; he said. &quot;I think in football now if you&apos;re one of the big clubs, you have to take your club to the supporters around the world. It means the extra money you earn from your marketing and from your sponsors is going to play a big part in the future. So I think it&apos;s something we&apos;re going to have to come to terms with and it is going to happen \u2013 and maybe even more so in the future.&quot; Moyes also stated that letting in nine goals in the five tour matches is a worry. &quot;We&apos;re concerned about conceding the goals,&quot; he said. &quot;But I think United were a bit like that at the start of last season and what they tended to do was score more than the opposition.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-07-29T21:39:38Z", "tags": ["Manchester United", "David Moyes", "Transfer window", "Cesc F\u00e0bregas", "Football", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jul/29/david-moyes-cesc-fabregas-nani-united", "title": "David Moyes returns to urgent talks over Cesc F\u00e1bregas and Nani", "sentences": ["So it was always going to be daunting but certainly you grow into it and, as the days go on, you start to feel a bit more comfortable.&quot; After stops in Bangkok, Sydney, Tokyo, Osaka and Hong Kong Moyes conceded that the tour was not the best preparation for the title defence."]}, {"article": "Rio Ferdinand believes he and other senior Manchester United players can help David Moyes become a better manager as the manager begins his first season as Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s successor. United returned home on Tuesday after the club&apos;s three-week pre-season tour, which took in games in Bangkok, Sydney, Tokyo, Osaka and Hong Kong, two of which were won, two lost and one drawn. But after only a month with his new squad, Moyes, according to Ferdinand, can draw on the experience of the players around him. &quot;I just look at it as if I was taking the job on,&quot; said Ferdinand. &quot;Would you lean on players who have been here for many years, for their experience and ask questions and to better yourself? Of course you would. You&apos;d do the same in any job, so you expect that.&quot; Ferdinand identified himself, Ryan Giggs and Michael Carrick as players who could make a valuable contribution. &quot;I think the manager is fortunate he&apos;s got someone like Giggsy, among others, like myself and Carras, who have been here for many years and know the fabric of the club. If there&apos;s anything we can pass on, with our experiences, to help him to become a better manager and to help us win more trophies, then that&apos;s fantastic.&quot; Moyes has been in the job for only three weeks and has yet to manage a competitive match, and Ferdinand thinks it is premature to compare the styles of Moyes and Ferguson. &quot;I think it&apos;s still too early to talk about stuff like that between the two of them,&quot; he added. &quot;The manager before was a one-off, there won&apos;t be anyone like him ever again and you can&apos;t expect anyone to fill his boots exactly the same way. &quot;And with this manager, I don&apos;t think you can start drawing comparisons yet with them both. You&apos;ve got to give the manager time and hopefully the manager is at a club where he will get that.&quot; Jesse Lingard was among United&apos;s best performers on tour, finishing as top scorer with four goals, and Ferdinand said the winger was one of the younger players who could establish himself in the squad this season. &quot;If you asked anyone else in the club they&apos;d tell you the same thing about him \u2013 that he is a great little player. On the last tour he was one of our best players but it didn&apos;t work out for him last season,&quot; the defender said. &quot;This season it remains to be seen but he couldn&apos;t have done any more to put himself in the shop window in terms of the manager.&quot; Ferdinand said. The centre-back has also been heartened by the displays of the other young players, Wilfried Zaha, Adnan Januzaj and Michael Keane. &quot;The best part of the tour has been seeing the young lads come through,&quot; he said. &quot;Fitness is the most important thing but the young lads have come through and shown they have the right qualities. &quot;He [Zaha] came with a big price tag for a young player [\u00a315m] but he&apos;s come in here, he&apos;s got a great personality, he&apos;s fitted in straight away as a lad [and] you can see he has the potential to become a really good player and this is the best place to do that.&quot; Despite Moyes not yet having made a major signing, Ferdinand is bullish about United&apos;s prospects of retaining the championship. &quot;We&apos;re confident. If we had to go into the new season with the players we&apos;ve got now, I&apos;d be more than confident of doing well and winning trophies but if the manager can add to that and chooses to add to that, then great. But that remains to be seen. &quot;Winning the league last season, I don&apos;t think that&apos;s going to change massively from this season, in terms of the way we play and things like that. The new manager is going to try to implement parts of his own style into our team but he&apos;s not silly.

But it was, for me, surprising to find that one of the very best movies at Cannes this year had such a shrill and hostile reception. Nicolas Winding Refn's brilliant, macabre and ultraviolent anti-revenge movie Only God Forgives \u2013 his most interesting work since the Pusher trilogy in the Mads Mikkelsen era \u2013 was deafeningly denounced at its first screening. Some booed from their seats, cupping their hands around their mouths so that the sound carried that vital few yards further. Then came the nervy, brushfire social-media consensus \u2013 a new feature of criticism at festivals \u2013&nbsp;as insecure pundits checked their Twitter feeds and committed themselves to derision, evidently taking Refn's supposed failure to be the \"story\", and in any case believing that something has to be seen to take a pasting if the praise-economy is not to go bankrupt. And all the while, middleweight products and franchise mediocrities are cordially waved&nbsp;through. \nI can only say that Refn's movie is entirely gripping, put together with lethal, formal brilliance, with bizarre setpieces of sentimentality and nauseous black comedy. It has its own miasma of anxiety and evil, taking place in a universe of fear, a place of deep-sea unreality in which you need to breathe through special gills \u2013 and through which the action swims at about 90% of normal speed through to&nbsp;its chilling conclusion. It is a kind of&nbsp;hallucinated tragi-exploitation shocker, an enriched uranium cake of pulp with a neon sheen. \n \n  \n  \n  A paragraph of dialogue \u2026 Ryan&nbsp;Gosling in Only God Forgives. Photograph: AP \n  \n \n The subject is expatriate American gangsters in a nightmarishly imagined Bangkok, self-exiled by traumatic family memories. Ryan Gosling plays Julian, a laconic tough guy who speaks hardly more than a paragraph's worth of dialogue throughout the whole film. He runs a drug business under the cover of&nbsp;a Muay Thai boxing club, co-managed with his brother, Billy (Tom Burke), a violent and hate-filled misogynist whose grisly fate is to involve Julian in&nbsp;a strange metaphysical duel with Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm), an enigmatic, samurai sword-wielding cop. The situation is made even more eerie and grotesque with the arrival of Julian's exasperated mother, Crystal (Kristin Scott Thomas), demanding acts of retributive violence. She is a widowed mob matriarch who knows very well what Julian can do: she is at&nbsp;once grateful and resentful and contemptuous, for reasons that emerge towards the end of the film, and which will make sense of Julian's behaviour. He seems paralysed by something that can't exactly be called conscience. With her icy-blue eyes ablaze \u2013 Julian's eyes are the same \u2013 Crystal taunts and denounces him, like some mix of Gertrude and Lady Macbeth. \n \n  \n  \n  Kristin Scott Thomas as widowed mob matriarch Crystal. Photograph: AP \n  \n \nIt is Chang who glides through the film with mysterious precision and ambiguity, calm and ruthless in his capacity for aggression, and for enforcing his own kind of natural justice on his own turf. Is he an avenger who punishes people \u2013 for seeking revenge? He could be a Zen master whose lifelong vocation is payback against payback, and whose students graduate with the loss of a limb. He could be a kind of black&nbsp;hole, drawing violent people in, nullifying them, cauterising them. Or perhaps he is just a Machiavellian figure with an instinctive gift for attracting and manipulating violence itself. \nEither way, Chang utterly upends what we might expect of a violent movie, and certainly what we might expect of a violent movie starring sexy&nbsp;Ryan Gosling. The winners and losers in straight physical combat are not obvious. And for all the director's mischievous public pronouncements about being a \"pornographer\", the violence here, though sometimes almost unwatchable, is effectively questioned far more than in many another straight action film. \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n Refn's direction, Larry Smith's cinematography and Beth Mickle's production design are all superb. The disturbing tracking shots down infernal corridors brought to mind Travis Bickle's final descent in Scorsese's Taxi Driver. The queasily presented Bangkok, in which daylight looks like just another kind of neon, is a little like that in Thomas Clay's Soi Cowboy (2008) or the Tokyo of Gaspar No\u00e9's Enter the Void (2009), but a closer comparison might well be with a Thai director, Wisit Sasanatieng, and his deadpan genre comedy Tears of the Black Tiger (2000), which had the same trope: the desolate singing of songs about lost love. Chang is a karaoke enthusiast, taking to the stage with his microphone, to sing impassively of heartache while his fellow officers sit around, their caps placed on tables, as respectful and alert as if at a debriefing.

Then came a pre-season tour taking in Seattle, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. Chelsea strutted across the US, building their brand and flinging banknotes. The club spent \u00a350m on Didier Drogba, Ricardo Carvalho and Tiago in the space of a week. At the dawn of Mourinho&apos;s second coming, Chelsea have returned to America. They faced one of his former teams, Internazionale, in Indianapolis on Wednesday night, dominating and winning 2-0 with first-half goals from Oscar and Eden Hazard, from a penalty, in front of 41,983 at Lucas Oil Stadium. Chelsea are now more familiar with the US than Oxfordshire: this is their eighth visit since 2004. It is only 69 days since they faced Manchester City at Yankee Stadium as part of a post-season tour. And it is only 10 months until the 2014 World Cup finals, with the former England manager, Fabio Capello, once again blaming tiredness for England&apos;s grim time in South Africa last time out.  Chelsea are in the middle of a stretch of seven matches in seven cities across two continents in 24 days: Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Indianapolis, New York, Miami, Washington. They arrive back in England a week before they start their Barclays Premier League campaign, against Hull City on 18 August. Chelsea are one of eight clubs taking part in the Guinness International Champions Cup, which is among the biggest, most sprawling and ambitious pre-season tournaments to date. Aiming to put the glory into &quot;glorified friendly&quot;, with a trophy, a knockout system of sorts and a defined path to the final, it is designed to be a more formal and prestigious successor to the nebulous World Football Challenge (WFC), which was held in the US and Canada between 2009 and 2012. The Champions Cup includes the best of MLS, the Los Angeles Galaxy, and some of Europe&apos;s elite teams, with Everton (champions of England as recently as 1987) acting as the control group in this particular experiment. Bizarrely, the opening match was in Spain \u2013 Milan beat Valencia 2-1 last Saturday at the Mestalla. Equally strangely, two baseball stadiums are host venues, though both Busch and Yankee Stadiums attracted excellent crowds back in May, for Chelsea and City. Everton beat Juventus 6-5 on penalties after a 1-1 draw on Wednesday, in front of 22,208 at AT&amp;T Park, the home of the San Francisco Giants. The same night, Major League Soccer hosted its All-Star Game in Kansas City, before a sell-out crowd of 21,175. So the domestic league&apos;s second-highest-profile match of the season had to compete for attention with a tricked-out exhibition game between foreign clubs in a ballpark. And with baseball-related publicity stunts involving Cristiano Ronaldo.      LA Galaxy forward Jack McBean, left, contests a header against Real Madrid. Photograph: Rick Scuteri/AP Images for Guinness International Champions Cup    The Galaxy are like travellers straddling the parallel universes of MLS and the Champions Cup. Bruce Arena&apos;s team did not even play in their own state in the first round. They met Real Madrid in a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona, on Wednesday night \u2013 the fourth summer fixture between the clubs in four years. Real outclassed the Galaxy 3-1, in front of 38,922. On Saturday, both teams head to Dodger Stadium, which has never before hosted football.  Despite all the league&apos;s shiny new soccer-specific venues, no MLS stadiums are being used \u2013 they are mostly too small. Arena described the scheduling as &quot;odd&quot;. The Europe-focused Fox Soccer is showing 11 of the 12 matches live, with another on Fox Sports \u2013 a last hurrah, since the channel lost its Premier League rights to NBC Sports and will soon close, with its content shifting to the incoming Fox Sports 1. The plan is for the new channel to televise next year&apos;s tournament. Friendly rivalries \u2013 a history Tours are innocuous moneyspinners and bonding exercises for overseas clubs but in North America they are touchstones for key questions. Who controls the sport in the US? Who profits? Does the annual arrival of glamorous and superior foreign teams in the middle of its season help or hurt MLS? More than a decade ago, Charlie Stillitano, a former general manager of the New York/New Jersey Metrostars, spied an opportunity to woo European clubs to the US to play friendlies in the summer on an organised basis. MLS was young and struggling but memories of the attendances and interest at the 1994 World Cup finals were still fresh. The US offers excellent training facilities, large crowds for matches against high-calibre opponents and relative anonymity for the players, who can step out of their hotels without being mobbed, unlike in Asia. And imagine the potential profits and business opportunities for clubs in a rich and untapped nation of more than 300 million people. Increasingly, through ownership or sponsorship, some of America&apos;s most powerful corporations and individuals have strong financial incentives for European clubs to prosper.     Manchester United take on Celtic in a ChampionsWorld game in Philadelphia, in 2004. Photograph: Jamie Squire/Getty Images    Stillitano launched ChampionsWorld, which in 2003 persuaded the dream draw, Manchester United, to cross the Atlantic to play very popular friendlies against Celtic, Club America, Barcelona and Juventus. United and Celtic returned the following year and were joined by the likes of Liverpool, Milan, Bayern Munich and Chelsea. It was a spectacular roster, but ChampionsWorld was in debt and costs were high \u2013 top clubs do not play for free. Hiring Manchester United reportedly costs up to $2m per match. And the organisers had to pay the US Soccer Federation more than $3m for the right to stage the games. In 2005, ChampionsWorld filed for bankruptcy; in 2006, its creditors sued MLS and the US Soccer Federation, alleging that the two authorities had conspired to make life impossible because they feared that private promoters staging international matches were undermining MLS. The league has its own promotions arm, Soccer United Marketing (SUM), which has organised exhibition games in recent years. Legal arguments ensued as to whether under US law and Fifa rules, the Federation had the right to control all professional matches under its jurisdiction, even if they were organised privately and involved foreign teams. Last August, a US district judge ruled in favour of US Soccer in the antitrust lawsuit but said that it only had authority over Olympic-related events according to US law. Not important, said US Soccer, as its lawyers did whatever the legal equivalent of a goal celebration is: our stranglehold derives from powers given to us by Fifa.  Stillitano rebounded to run the WFC with a colleague, Jon Sheiman \u2013 partnering with SUM/MLS and Creative Artists Agency, the massive Hollywood talent agency. Last year Sheiman and Stillitano agreed to join a new sports and entertainment company called RSE Ventures, which has lots of clever ideas about how to part fans from their cash. It acquired the rights to the WFC and formed a New York-based, spellcheck-defying division called Relevent Sports. Last year&apos;s WFC featured four MLS teams and nine fixtures and was heavily promoted on the official MLS website. There were no matches within three days either side of the All-Star Game. This year, though, MLS has no involvement in the Champions Cup beyond the Galaxy&apos;s participation and its website has largely ignored it. The showpiece games are in South Florida&apos;s ageing Sun Life Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins. RSE&apos;s joint-founder, the real-estate billionaire Stephen Ross, owns the Dolphins and the stadium. Since Miami is trying to win a new MLS franchise that would most likely have David Beckham as a figurehead, packed stands for this orgy of international star power would help bolster its claim to be a football hotbed. The Miami Herald reported this week that the games on 6 and 7 August are expected to sell out. Two-day, four-game passes cost from a reasonable $72.20 to a ridiculous $1,126.90, through Ticketmaster. Logically enough, SI.com&apos;s Grant Wahl reported earlier this year that Ross is a contender to own any future Miami club.

His new film as writer-director, Only God Forgives, exhibits both these elements but is set far from Denmark in a stylised, present-day Bangkok, almost entirely at night in underpopulated, garishly neon-lit streets and dark interiors, though there&apos;s one memorable, downbeat shot of the oppressive, smog-ridden city in the early morning. The film&apos;s central character is an American expatriate played by Ryan Gosling, who made a serious impression as a getaway driver in Refn&apos;s Los Angeles-set Drive. More recently he appeared as a sad fairground performer and criminal in Derek Cianfrance&apos;s A Place Beyond the Pines, one of this year&apos;s best movies, which he dominates from first to last despite saying little and dying a third of the way through. Gosling is even more taciturn here as Julian Thompson, the owner of a kickboxing club and stadium, but he&apos;s no romantic expatriate with a colourful past in the traditional manner of Humphrey Bogart&apos;s Rick Blaine. Julian&apos;s establishment is the front for a big-time drug-dealing operation, in which he&apos;s assisted by his headstrong older brother Billy (Tom Burke), a true lowlife. In the first few minutes, a drunken Billy murders an underage prostitute and appears to surrender to the local police.           From this fairly conventional beginning a variety of police procedural and noir options offer themselves, but nothing remotely like what ensues. The story unfolds in a series of carefully composed tableaux accompanied by a mixture of western and oriental music, and what is enacted is a dreamlike fable of revenge and retribution. The violence is graphic, daring the viewer to watch without flinching. All but one of the characters appear to be engaging in, and submitting to, bizarre rituals that derive from some mutually understood criminal code or religious system. A Thai policeman of formidable presence (Vithaya Pansringarm) arrives to work on the case. He&apos;s called Chang in the film&apos;s production notes but remains unnamed in the movie. Considering himself to be God&apos;s representative on Earth, he&apos;s dressed all in black and believed by everyone around him to be an avenging angel. He first encourages the young prostitute&apos;s elderly father to beat Billy to death and then cuts off the old man&apos;s right arm with an executioner&apos;s sword as punishment for allowing his daughter to work as a prostitute. A succession of executions and torture sessions follows, using swords, guns and other instruments, all according to some perceived sense of moral logic. From time to time the Chang figure takes to the stage in various nightclubs to entertain fellow cops and military men with sentimental popular songs. Does a modern oriental god relax from his labours by becoming a karaoke performer? I don&apos;t know whether &quot;only God forgives&quot; is an old saying or a quotation, but the same phrase figured last week in Everardo Gout&apos;s Mexican crime movie Days of Grace. The person who doesn&apos;t quite fit in is Julian&apos;s mother, Crystal (Kristin Scott Thomas in her most radical piece of casting to date), a grotesque American mafia matriarch who&apos;s come halfway round the world to attend her elder son&apos;s funeral. Thickly applied kohl and mascara make her eyes look like volcanoes about to erupt; she has the nose of an anteater that&apos;s been sniffing coke and a face that has been abandoned after a lift too many. She&apos;s both funny and frightening and her principal reaction to Billy&apos;s death is to remark: &quot;I&apos;m sure he had his reasons&quot;, a jokey reference to Renoir&apos;s explanation for all human behaviour in La R\u00e8gle du jeu. She&apos;s outrageous, an affront to society, and at dinner with the subdued Julian and his Thai mistress she insists on ordering for all three of them before insulting both her guests and throwing herself into the deadly game of revenge. She later fills in some useful background by telling Chang that Julian was responsible for her widowhood and suspected her of incest. Only God Forgives is in some ways reminiscent of the fashionable obsession with eastern religions, rituals and colourful social practices that some American film-makers exhibited a few years ago in films such as Paul Schrader&apos;s Mishima, Steven Spielberg&apos;s Empire of the Sun, Martin Scorsese&apos;s Kundun and Jim Jarmusch&apos;s Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai. Peter Greenaway&apos;s The Pillow Book was in a similar vein. Only God Forgives might even be seen as a parody of those pictures, except that Refn is clearly deadly serious. He dedicates his film to the Chilean-born Russian surrealist Alejandro Jodorowsky, a cult director of the 1970s and 80s whose violent fables El Topo and Santa Sangre, which once outraged critics and pleased midnight movie enthusiasts, were infamous for their scenes of mutilation. Moreover he&apos;s presenting what is in fact a Franco-Danish co-production as if it were an Asian movie: the credits are printed in elegant Thai followed by the English translations as if they&apos;re subsidiary. Anyway, one way and another, Only God Forgives is a provocative oddity that like Lars von Trier&apos;s recent movies looks back nostalgically to a time when it was still possible to stir up jaded audiences and \u00e9pater le bourgeois. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 August 2013.", "publicationDate": "2013-08-03T23:06:00Z", "tags": ["Crime", "Nicolas Winding Refn", "Film", "Ryan Gosling", "Culture", "Kristin Scott Thomas"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/04/only-god-forgives-review", "title": "Only God Forgives \u2013 review", "sentences": ["His new film as writer-director, Only God Forgives, exhibits both these elements but is set far from Denmark in a stylised, present-day Bangkok, almost entirely at night in underpopulated, garishly neon-lit streets and dark interiors, though there&apos;s one memorable, downbeat shot of the oppressive, smog-ridden city in the early morning."]}, {"article": "Ariel Siegel, programme manager, Somaly Mam Foundation, New York, US. @arielsiegel  Ethical businesses can play a double role in combating slavery: By following ethical labour practices especially in developing countries, businesses can create more jobs that pay living wages, which in turn reduces poverty rates. Businesses in these situations can play a great role in economic development in some of these regions where slavery is rife. Rehabilitation efforts must be co-ordinated, and governed by a central body: Countries need national action plans and referral mechanisms to support survivors of slavery and help them move through the proper channels to receive assistance. Service providers need to focus on vocational training and work closely with communities to ensure successful rehabilitation when a survivor is ready. Learn from survivors: Survivors have first hand experience of the tactics used by slave traders and what it takes to escape slavery. Using their experience and wisdom, anti-slavery groups can improve their services across disciplines, from rescue tactics and rehabilitation to identifying root causes of vulnerability and situations where risk for abuse increases. Resources: The UN Inter-Agency Project on Human Trafficking&apos;s Commit project is a great way of uniting anti-slavery organisations in Cambodia. A good example of the anti-slavery community uniting on an issue was when groups campaigned against Backpage.com, a website hosted by Village Voice Media that sold minors into the sex trade in America. There&apos;s also a piece of legislation to establish an advisory council on human trafficking in America, made up of male and female survivors of both labour and sex trafficking. Learn more about the bill here. Annick Febrey, legislative affairs manager, International Justice Mission, Washington DC, United States. @ijm  Don&apos;t force collaboration if your priorities don&apos;t overlap: It&apos;s crucial for anti-slavery groups to focus on common priorities and support each other in addressing them. The alliance to end slavery and trafficking has goals that it comes to as a group, but has a separate support system for organisations with priorities that aren&apos;t complimentary. Sandhya Lakshmi Chellapilla, senior manager, ActionAid India, New Delhi, India. @ActionAidIndia Tackle the complex causes of slavery at their roots: Bonded labour can be reduced by addressing structural problems, like a lack of education and employment opportunities, and responding quickly to environmental disasters, such as drought. Keep track of those you rescue to avoid them falling back into slavery: For effective action it is essential to understand the changing dynamics of bonded labour. It would be extremely helpful if organisations created information databases to trace back bonded labourers well after their rescue and followed up on their wellbeing. This is something we are trying to do in India, as many fall back into slavery once rescued. Nick Grono, CEO, Walk Free, Perth, Australia. @nickgrono New NGOs should bring unique approaches: The anti-slavery sector has a lot of highly experienced, but relatively small NGOs active in the field. There is therefore room for innovative new efforts that bring different, not duplicate approaches and dimensions to the response. Ruici Tio, head of strategic partnerships, MTV Exit, Bangkok, Thailand. @rtio Regardless of your sector, improve your data collection: Arguably, all agencies, whether private corporations, governments, NGOs or international organisations, need to have better sustained systems of data collection and management in place. Ultimately, this will better ensure that there is regular, reliable information about what trafficking trends actually look like and therefore inform strategic, targeted interventions. Groups should learn more from each other&apos;s projects: Various forms of evidence can inform programme design and implementation. Something that all organisations can learn from, especially those on the frontlines, is experiential evidence. Implementers would benefit from interviewing each other at various stages of programme delivery. This ties back to partnerships: while many organisations are not equipped with the capacity to do primary research on the incidence of trafficking in particular locations, they are able to collect and share evidence based on their own interventions. Resources: Knowledge sharing between organisations is crucial to keeping tabs on often unpredictable traffickers. In Thailand, the UN Inter-Agency Project on Human Trafficking and organisations like the Anti-Trafficking Co-ordination Unit of Northern Thailand may assist in providing forums to promote this type of knowledge sharing. MTV Exit has hosted stakeholder meetings to facilitate this. Feel free to contact our head of development, Tara Dermott for more information. Rasha Hammad, senior manager \u2013 advocacy and communications, End Human Trafficking Now, Geneva, Switzerland. @EHTN_org Share your data to avoid replication: Information-sharing avoids unnecessary replication where organisations can join forces to fight against a common cause. This in turn increases the credibility of associations who need the attention and resources to fight slavery and trafficking. Resources: End Human Trafficking Now provides corporations with tools to address human trafficking in their supply chains. Aidan McQuade, director of Anti-Slavery International, London, UK. @the_mcquade Anti-slavery organisations cannot achieve much without engaging with other sectors: Slavery will only be tackled through collaborations between governments, business, and civil society, including trade unions and development agencies. All the anti-slavery organisations in the world could be working together in perfect harmony (and many of us do), but its impact would be limited without that broader engagement. Engaging corporations is key, so long as they address their faults: Before the necessary collaboration with the corporate sector can occur, firms will have to confront any exploitation that occurs in their supply chains. Resources: The Anti-Trafficking Monitoring Group is an excellent example of a group of disparate agencies coming together to monitor the UK&apos;s trafficking policy. Patricia Toquica, Americas region communications manager, ChildFund International, Panama City, Panama. @PatriciaToquica  Media platforms are powerful tools, but outputs must be well-balanced: Social media has a key role to play in combating slavery, especially when resources and funding for other types of campaigns are scarce. However, communications on slavery issues must be balanced. Corporations often publicise their corporate social responsibility efforts, but human interest angles must be covered and victims and survivors must be portrayed with dignity and respect. Rola Abimourched, programme co-ordinator, Kafa (enough) Violence &amp; Exploitation, Beirut, Lebanon. @KAFA_Lebanon Identify common ground by forming working groups: Before the anti-trafficking law was passed in Lebanon, we formed an NGO working group to review the proposed draft law, provide comments, suggest revisions and lobby for their uptake. This resulted in a better anti-trafficking law, and should be replicated in other countries. Werawan Mosby, director, Hug Project, Chiang Mai, Thailand. @BoomBean1 Resources: In Chiang Mai government bodies and NGO sectors are working very closely together under &apos;the Multidisciplinary Team approach&apos; to victim protection.

The bill, proposed by the ruling Pheu Thai party, is highly contentious as it would broadly absolve those arrested, charged and prosecuted for political activities after the 2006 military coup that overthrew Thaksin. It would not provide amnesty to protest leaders or government authorities, but opponents fear that it could be stretched to clear the return of Thaksin, who was charged with conflict of interest after his ousting and sentenced to two years&apos; imprisonment. Thaksin has avoided the charges by living in self-exile abroad, although it is widely believed that he still leads the country by proxy through his sister Yingluck, the current prime minister. On Sunday about 1,000 people turned out in Bangkok for a peaceful protest organised by a group known as the People&apos;s Army against the Thaksin Regime. Organisers hope for a far greater turnout on Wednesday. Police deployed 30,000 officers at key locations around the city, including parliament and the prime minister&apos;s office compound. An internal security act has been invoked until 10 August, allowing the government to impose curfews, close roads and ban the use of electronic devices in designated areas. Tul Sittisomwong, a Thaksin opponent who will be protesting on Wednesday, said: &quot;At the end of the day, at the end of this deadlock, Thaksin will be set free. To set Thaksin free they have to set everybody free \u2026 Pheu Thai says it&apos;s to put peace back into the country but it&apos;s not, it&apos;s just to put Thaksin back into power. That&apos;s the plan.&quot; Six versions of the amnesty bill are being circulated, but only one has been tabled for discussion in parliament on Wednesday. The bill is intended to help stoke political reconciliation after the 2006 coup. In 2008 Thaksin opponents occupied the prime minister&apos;s compound for three months and Bangkok&apos;s two airports for a week. In 2010 90 people were killed and 2,000 injured when Thaksin supporters occupied downtown Bangkok before being bloodily ousted by the army. Amnesty International has called the bill &quot;an insult to the victims and families of the 2010 violence&quot;, as it would also exonerate soldiers and army commanders involved in the deaths or injuries of protesters. The political tension and threat of possible violence during this week&apos;s protests have stoked rumours of a potential coup against Yingluck&apos;s government \u2013 claims the army has denied. The government has clamped down on those spreading such rumours, with four Facebook users \u2013 among them the political editor of a public TV channel \u2013 under investigation by police for allegedly spreading false information. They could face up to five years&apos; imprisonment and a heavy fine if charged and convicted. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist at Bangkok&apos;s Chulalongkorn University, said the protests demonstrated a disenchantment&quot; with the government but it was highly unlikely that they would overthrow it. &quot;The protest really is designed to unseat the government. But the anti-Thaksin coalition is not united, there is unlikely to be any intervention by the military or the judiciary, and there is not enough traction, not enough numbers [from the protesters], for them to really succeed,&quot; he said.", "publicationDate": "2013-08-06T16:46:33Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Thaksin Shinawatra", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/06/bangkok-anti-thaksin-protests-thailand", "title": "Bangkok braces for anti-Thaksin protests", "sentences": ["On Sunday about 1,000 people turned out in Bangkok for a peaceful protest organised by a group known as the People&apos;s Army against the Thaksin Regime.", "In 2008 Thaksin opponents occupied the prime minister&apos;s compound for three months and Bangkok&apos;s two airports for a week.", "In 2010 90 people were killed and 2,000 injured when Thaksin supporters occupied downtown Bangkok before being bloodily ousted by the army.", "Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist at Bangkok&apos;s Chulalongkorn University, said the protests demonstrated a disenchantment&quot; with the government but it was highly unlikely that they would overthrow it."]}, {"article": "Krystle v Alexis in the lily pond, Krystle v Alexis in the mud spa, Krystle v Alexis with the pillows, Krystle v Alexis in the fashion closet, Alexis v Sable at the cocktail party, Alexis v Dominique in the apricot guest suite, Sammy Jo v Fallon in the horse trough, Sammy Jo v Amanda in the pool, Krystle v Evil Krystle in the cellar, Bill Giles v Michael Fish in the BBC weather office. To the canon of television&apos;s most edifying catfights must be added another chapter, as former Beeb weatherman Bill Giles breaks another 15-minute silence about that forecast, and claims his more junior colleague Michael Fish was always bitter about Bill&apos;s meteoric meteorological rise. Fish formed an alliance with fellow Met Office A-lister John Kettley, apparently, with the aim of overthrowing Giles, who seems to fancy himself as having seen off this assassination attempt much in the manner of Albert Finney tommy-gunning his way out of his house and down the street in Miller&apos;s Crossing. Yeah, turns out Bill&apos;s still an artist with a Thompson. Not like &quot;bitter&quot; Ian McCaskill, who once dismissed him as acting like &quot;a prefect at a minor public school&quot;. You have to say, Bill really does seem like a lovely man. He&apos;s got a book coming out, if this lively teaser campaign contrives to secure a publisher \u2013 a searing backstage portrait of BBC weather forecasting 1983-2000, which would make the perfect present for someone to whom you wished to deliver a calculated insult. A large shipment of the audio version is believed to be on its way for use in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Written with his longtime editor John Teather \u2013 another one his rival forecasters were always said to have loathed \u2013 the book is racily entitled You Have Wives?, which is sure to secure the services of Clooney and DiCaprio for the inevitable film version. The oddest thing said about the opus thus far is that it has &quot;reignited&quot; the feud between the forecasting division of the era, when in truth that one has been burning longer than the Springfield Tyre Fire (est 1989). Perhaps the only Beeb department of the period that could have rivalled it as a hotbed of seething resentment was Radio 1, whose disc jockeys were locked in such rabid internecine conflict that John Peel later confessed to having once formed a posse with Kid Jensen and Paul Burnett, left the station Christmas party, &quot;and waited in the underground car park for the opportunity to beat up Simon Bates&quot;. Happily \u2013 HAPPILY \u2013 Bates didn&apos;t show, just as attempts to dethrone Giles were thwarted down the years. In 1999, he survived a drive-by bullying tribunal. As Teather observes mildly: &quot;The animals were baying for blood.&quot; And so to the meat of You Have Wives?, whose Partridgean dedication page reads: &quot;Written at the Villa Francia, Lanzarote, Canaries. The authors would like to thank Villa Plus for helping with the difficult internet connections.&quot; It&apos;s all there: the plot to overthrow them; the road trips, where they admire the beautiful air hostesses whispering the offer of breakfast in their ears; the night they got aroused by a Bangkok stripper only to discover with the removal of the final garment that she was a ladyboy. The book is unabashed in stating its purpose \u2013 it is designed &quot;to help future generations of weather forecasters&quot;, in order that they may safeguard the &quot;lives and property&quot; of an otherwise benighted people. A gift to the nation that is almost beyond price. Needless to say, though, the standout line in the excerpts published has been Bill&apos;s return to a certain fateful night in 1987. &quot;I understand it was put in the Guinness Book of Records as the worst forecast in the history of the universe,&quot; declares Bill of Michael Fish&apos;s famous cock-up, &quot;and it if wasn&apos;t, it should have been.&quot; Man alive, that bloody hurricane ... I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve heard nearly enough about it, do you? At the time, it seemed like an almost unfathomably massive event, given that the lengthy power cut it caused prevented my 13-year-old self from watching telly at half term. But nearly 26 years later, with the apparent insistence of thrice-annual, angst-ridden media memorials to the Fish broadcast, I have come to realise that it was bigger even than that. It was a defining psychological event in the life of the nation. In fact, if you wanted to pinpoint the precise historical moment at which Britain realised we had been admitted to the twilight home of international life, that erroneous weather report was it. For what other possible reason could we still be talking about it, and with such masochistic frequency? For a country as self-consciously obsessed with the weather as this one is, the failure to be able to predict even a hurricane evidently represented the most savage of epiphanies. Whatever figleaf of national dignity was left to us after Suez was ripped away that very night, and we have been shivering in the waste spaces ever since, clinging to our nuclear weapons and our seat on the security council as if they in any way make up for our greybeards&apos; inability to spot a whole hurricane on their radar. I say &quot;radar&quot;, but of course, few genuinely believe the Met office to hold faith with such new-fangled technology, when the old ways have seen our tribe right for millennia. The instruments of their craft have long been suspected to be entrails, with whichever haruspex is in charge of foretelling things that day poking through them with a stick, simulating a hypnotic trance, and deploying a stagily guttural groan to communicate the prediction &quot;a bit unsettled&quot;. Not for us the hi-tech, cutthroat world of American weather wars, with even local news stations locked in an arms race to acquire the latest eleventy billion dollar Doppler radar system, and the very real sense that viewers expect something other than quasi-genial incompetence.

Escaping poverty can difficult if markets don&apos;t offer poor people what they need to raise their incomes - opportunities, jobs, goods and services. So M4P programmes set out to improve market systems, making them work better for society&apos;s worst-off. Sounds sensible enough, but how do you identify markets that don&apos;t work, and how do you improve them? M4P projects target markets that exclude the poorest, and make them more inclusive. They do this in many different ways, from supporting cooperatives to sell high quality hay to farmers in Kenya to planning and designing accessible urban spaces in Libya. Because all markets are complex, M4P approaches have to be adapted to suit each one. An implementation guide (pdf) from development agencies DfID and Sida stresses that programmes &quot;cannot be reduced to blueprints or formulae&quot;, and that &quot;flexibility and creativity are essential&quot;. So what practical guidance is there for implementing M4P programmes effectively? In its advice on the approach, American development agency USAid advises against taking a direct role, in favour of supporting existing groups or institutions to create &apos;systemic change&apos;. But the question remains: how do you decide which groups to support? Do organisations that promote M4P run the risk of simply &apos;backing the winning horse&apos;? Critics say the approach can focus on supporting existing private sector enterprises, rather than the poorest, or prioritising growth over equitable access to wealth. In a recent debate on the online forum M4P Hub, Social Development Direct chief, Sarah Maguire, stressed that &quot;the most obvious participants in economic activity will be those who are out in public. If consultation is limited to these visible actors, it risks perpetuating the invisibility and marginalisation of women or marginalised groups.&quot; So how should M4P programmes adapt to different contexts, cultures and communities? How can they achieve inclusivity without compromising sustainability, or scale - two of the five core principles? Join us to discuss these questions and more on Thursday, 15 August, from 1-3pm BST.

The first time it happened, the CD was called The Wheels on the Bus and Other Songs. The second time, when we should have known better, we were trapped in a hire car with nothing to listen to but a collection called Songs From Around the World (32 kids songs). At first I thought the repetition might make me insane, but by the end of the week I came to believe that you haven&apos;t really understood Yellow Bird until you&apos;ve heard it sung by a chorus of schoolchildren from the Midlands. We bought a case that holds about 20 CDs, but it only served to keep our carefully selected music together on the kitchen table, where we left it. Then a search of the car would turn up one mildly damaged disc that had to serve as our holiday listening. We once spent a fortnight in Cornwall with nothing but Scouting for Girls&apos; eponymous debut for company. I recently met the band; it was like being reintroduced to one&apos;s captors. After a while this consistent failure was recast as an intentional practice, part of a larger scheme to travel light. We took nothing but Now That&apos;s What I Call Music 61 (disc 2 only) to the south of France for 10 days. It has Crazy Frog on it, so that should give you an idea of my state of mind by day eight. One summer I burned a playlist of crowd-pleasing, inoffensive standards on to a disc and christened it the &quot;Cool Fun CD&quot;. Unfortunately, I was the only person in the family who thought it either cool or fun. We had the Arctic Monkeys instead, all the way to Scotland and back.Restriction of choice, we discovered, is the key to in-car harmony: there is nothing to argue about, and even if nobody likes an album at the beginning, everybody has memorised it by the end. Last year, after earnest deliberation, the oldest child selected the Felice Brothers&apos; God Bless You, Amigo for our fortnight in Spain. We played it several dozen times, learned it off by heart, and sang it all the way to the airport at the end. For me, it will always be associated with that time and place, because I couldn&apos;t listen to it for almost a year afterwards. Emma Kennedy: the Cornish pasty rules     Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    When I was a child, one rule was stamped into the core of my being: you only eat Cornish pasties in Cornwall. In the 1970s this didn&apos;t seem preposterous. I&apos;d never seen a croissant before going to France, let alone eaten one, so it seemed logical that foods associated with a region could and should only be eaten on their home turf. We went to Cornwall repeatedly as a family, and it is now my go-to UK destination. In the 1970s we would always camp, but after my father killed our tent by setting it on fire in a glorious Up Yours Camping moment in our back garden, we upgraded to the glorious holiday cottage rental. The rules of arrival were always thus: bagsy a room, dump overpacked suitcase, find the nearest Cornish pasty dispensary, buy one, sit on any available sea wall, and eat while hot. For a pasty that comes pretty near to perfection, I recommend Aunty May&apos;s in Newlyn (but you&apos;ll need to be quick: they fly off the shelves in no time). I have never eaten a Cornish pasty outside of Cornwall. It is so ingrained in me that pasties mean holiday that the thought of eating one in London, or anywhere else, feels as wrong as suddenly growing gills. And because of that, every time I go, and every time I tuck into one, I am transported back to when I was 10, sitting with my dad and grinning. Glorious. Dixe Wills: hiding in churches When I&apos;m travelling, I love a good poke about in an old church. I love to read the inscriptions and I love the kneeler covers stitched by the Women&apos;s Wednesday Prayer Group. Most of all, though, I love finding potential places to hide. I imagine that I&apos;m on the run: sometimes for an offence of which I&apos;m wholly innocent, or at least largely innocent; sometimes from an oppressive regime. It depends on my mood. To outwit my pursuers, I decide to sleep in churches at night. In order to effect this, I must first evade any casual inspection by whoever locks up at dusk \u2013 hence the need for a place to hide. I don&apos;t want to give away the secrets of my decades of research, but I can reveal that often the only feasible location is behind the altar. Just make sure the cloth reaches all the way down to the floor or they&apos;ll see your feet. Top tip. Laurie Graham: Venetian haircuts          We used to live in Venice and now, on our occasional return to our old Dorsoduro neighbourhood, we go through a three-part re-entry routine. First my husband gets his hair cut by Silent Barber, on Campiello Mosca. For 10 years he cut my husband&apos;s hair regularly, so you&apos;d think he might be jolted out of his silence by someone&apos;s sudden reappearance. But no: on he snips, unfazed. I go ahead, over the bridge into Campo Santa Margherita, to the Soveco minimarket. Soveco is a kind of Tardis of cheap goods: socks, talcum powder, canary food, bottle stoppers, plastic champagne glasses. I don&apos;t feel I&apos;m back in Venice until I&apos;ve spent at least \u20ac20 on things I never knew I needed. Then it&apos;s on to a cafe to reconvene with my shorn husband; it&apos;s our old haunt near the Carmini church, a nameless and charmingly dilapidated joint that serves very fine apple sfoglie (pastries). As with Silent Barber, our return goes unremarked by the padrone. It&apos;s like we never went away. \u2022 Laurie Graham&apos;s latest novel, A Humble Companion (Quercus, \u00a37.99) is out on 29 August.

But since I was a massively attractive and popular teenager, I have had a passion for Shakespeare. No. As I was not, in fact, anywhere near cool as a teenager, I embraced the beauty and life and so forth in Shakespeare with more than average warmth, and a school trip led me to believe that Stratford-upon-Avon was the place to score high-grade performances. I therefore saved up each year to afford one summer week in Stratford, seeing as much of the RSC&apos;s repertoire as I could. In the early 1980s that was still a rewarding and wonderful thing, and tickets were either side of \u00a35. I established a pattern which persists even now. I walk by the river \u2013 which is bloody lovely, and will offer kingfishers if you follow it far enough. I consider hiring a boat and then don&apos;t \u2013 although it is the best way to enjoy the banks. I head down Bridge Street with a hippity-hoppity heart, and expect to come to the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, though it has been replaced by a pretend-industrial-conversion. I walk along Waterside, past the Black Swan/Dirty Duck (the only pub I know with a stage name), where the ploughman&apos;s lunch would choke a horse, or leave a human very full for a good while, and head for Holy Trinity church, where I will maunder about near Bill&apos;s bones and hope to be a better typist. It&apos;s fun all the way with me. \u2022 A L Kennedy&apos;s latest novel is The Blue Book (Vintage, \u00a38.99).

Friends had an island off the coast, which was less glamorous than it sounds; it was a few acres of rock and trees surrounded by icy water. Yet it had an unforgettable magic, with glorious views over a sea in which boats and surf sparkled in dazzling sunlight. A short launch trip took us to the mainland and Stonington, then a modest fishing village. No posh restaurants, but a diner serving classic American breakfasts (plus lobster rolls, the perfect New England delicacy), and chandlers&apos; shop rather than boutiques selling Peruvian wind chimes. There&apos;s a small theatre, offering good amateur productions all summer. You can still buy lobsters at sheds on the shore, though world prices are now so high the lobstermen tend to live in large houses inland. Stonington has been discovered by folk from Boston, New York and further away. We live in Britain now, but go back every few years. There is a fine wine shop, and the old general store is now a pretty fancy restaurant. But it still exerts a tremendous charm. And last year we learned sea kayaking. Howard Marks: travel essentials/Pakistan I have drawers full of useless travel accessories and so-called requisites: a Swiss Army knife, radio alarms, currency converters, pocket translators, adapters, SIM cards, chargers and more, most of which either never worked, have stopped working, or have been condemned to the graveyard of style. My first holiday tradition is to ensure I have none of those on me, in order to save space and avoid mindless encounters with airport security. I am neither particularly promiscuous nor fastidiously fussy about my teeth, but I regard dental floss and condoms as essential items for any trip abroad. Floss is ideal for hanging mosquito nets and assembling clothes lines in hotel bathrooms. Condoms I use as a defence against the army of fire alarms unleashed on smokers in hotel rooms and loos in trains, airports and elsewhere \u2013 condoms fit snugly over most of them. Most years I go to Pakistan. My love of the country began during my initial cannabis smuggling days, in the early 1970s, and the main reason for my continuing visits is to see my first connection for procuring hashish, Salim Malik. We might reminisce about the old days, but he is in his late eighties, and each of our profiles is far too high to revert to that trade now. Nevertheless, we have formed an enduring friendship, and he is my son&apos;s godfather. I always try to visit the Kalash Valley. Despite its association with Islamic fundamentalists, freedom of religion is a pillar of the Pakistan constitution. There are churches, synagogues, Hindu temples, and pagan sacrificial altars. The Valleys of the Black Infidels, inaccessible during the snowy months, straddle the Pakistan/Afghan border and were once part of Kafiristan \u2013 setting for Rudyard Kipling&apos;s The Man Who Would Be King. A century ago, Afghan Kafirs were forcibly converted to Islam, but the Pakistan Kafirs retain their own pagan religion, culture and habits. Men and women indulge heavily in their surprisingly palatable and strong red wines and spirits and get completely bladdered at a bewildering series of full-on dance festivals. The women wear dresses tied with black sashes. Countless strings of multi-coloured beads hang from their necks, and rows of cowrie shells and bright buttons adorn their hair. They dance by stomping and shuffling through an intricate series of cartwheels and polka dance-step circles to drums, handclaps, flutes, penny whistles and catcalls. Either gender may marry or divorce a spouse of any nationality or religion. There are no police, no prisons, no written law, no written language, no word for &quot;goodbye.&quot; Nowhere else worth going. Phil Daoust: Lac de Longemer, Vosges, France     Photograph: Jean-Christophe Verhaegen/AFP    I used to live in the Vosges, a thickly forested, mountainous corner of eastern France. Now I just go there on holiday. There is one spot I&apos;ve just visited for the hundredthandwhatever time: the Lac de Longemer, just outside the town of G\u00e9rardmer. This long, narrow stretch of water, bordered by campsites and spruce forests, is too cold to swim in for nine months of the year, but since I first stepped into its clear, clean waters five years ago, I haven&apos;t looked at another lake. What&apos;s special about it? Well, the snack bar at the northern end does a lovely, salty saucisse-frites \u2013 just what you need after a few hours of back- and breaststroke. But it&apos;s mostly the quiet. Motor boats are banned, and no one seems to sail or windsurf, so the only vessels you&apos;re likely to encounter are pedalos. There&apos;s not a single lifeguard or supervised bathing spot on its 2km length. It would be easy to drown here, unseen and unaided. That&apos;s part of the charm too. Every time you strike out across the lake, you are on your own. Except \u2013 if you are lucky \u2013 for the swallows wheeling overhead. Sophie Cooke: Sutherland, Scotland Braelangwell Lodge sits on an impossibly pretty stretch of the Carron river. My grandparents rented it every year, not for the scenery but for the salmon. I came as a child and a teenager. I recall reading novels on the lawn, gossiping with cousins I didn&apos;t see from one year to the next, swimming in the amber pools just beyond the garden, lazing on riverbanks. Now and then we would be hauled off to tramp through heather, raising grouse for the guns, or to accompany our parents on fishing trips. I wasn&apos;t much of a sportswoman; I just loved the countryside, the river, the company, and the comfy sprawling house. Braelangwell is near the village of Ardgay, which has a train station. Up the narrow road a few miles in the other direction \u2013 upriver \u2013 is the point where the Blackwater flows into the Carron. Sandy-bottomed, slow and safe, the Blackwater is a great place for children to swim. A bit further on is Croick Kirk, a pretty white church with a peaceful appearance and a troubled history. More than 80 displaced crofters were forced to camp as refugees in this graveyard during the highland clearances: a situation that caused a scandal as far away as London. Time unwinds further if you walk through Amat Forest, where the great pines are one of the last remains of the ancient Caledonian Forest. The old quietness wraps itself around you: nothing but the sound of the wind in the trees and calling wood pigeons. I still go back to Sutherland. There is something very grave about its beauty that draws me again and again, though these days I stay in artists&apos; studios rather than fishing lodges. \u2022 Sophie Cooke&apos;s novels The Glass House and Under The Mountain are both set in the Scottish Highlands. The Amat Estate has three self-catering cottages  Pico Iyer: internet cafe culture The point of a holiday for me is to get away from the temptation to check emails more than once a day. Yet I step into an internet cafe in Bangkok, at 3.16am, and a door to surprise and a distinctive culture swings open. The proprietress curtseys to me as I hand over the equivalent of 30p. The other customers are ladies of the night, giggling over love letters from admirers in Dusseldorf or Berkhamsted. I log on at the &quot;Cyber-Caf\u00e9&quot; in Dharamsala, India, and am greeted by an intimate confession in Hebrew. I visit an internet salon in Paris and face an inscrutable keyboard. In Hiroshima I push the wrong button and my message to my boss comes out in alien characters. In southern Yemen, six weeks before 9/11, I walk into an internet cafe to find veiled women in front of all 11 terminals, accessing images of dreamed-of New York. And in Kashmir, where I write this, a heavy wooden door, locked from the inside, guards my cubicle. Two pairs of shoes are visible under another door. Cinemas are too raucous, streets too crowded \u2026 in the shadow of the Shalimar Gardens, an internet cafe is the one place where Kashmiri lovers can conspire behind closed doors. \u2022 Pico Iyer is the author, most recently, of The Man Within My Head, price \u00a316.99.

Since then I cannot keep away, returning sometimes more than once a year and in all seasons, often alone. I am lured back by a quality of light and air that I have never found elsewhere. I have written parts of three novels in a beachfront apartment there, in bursts of inspiration that seem to rise out of the magnificent surf, or the scatter of seabirds at the water&apos;s edge or the afternoon sun that tints the sand orange and purple and finally sets in a glittering pink. I have tramped for miles in sun and rain, day and night, looping along across the dunes and along the winding road into Clonakilty. And when I&apos;m not there, I sometimes visit the beach cam online and dream that I am perched on the grassy cliffs watching the wetsuited surfers face down the horizon, arched like black lizards on their boards, waiting for the transforming wave. The Inchydoney Island Lodge and Spa is an easy hour&apos;s drive from Cork airport and on first glance seems like an architectural insult to the coastline. But you can forgive it all for the warm welcome, the jets in the seawater pool that batter you senseless, the thalassotherapy that unravels you, the crab cakes and the relaxed and friendly atmosphere that makes it so hard to leave. And these days, as Ireland creaks under economic strain, it&apos;s all so much cheaper than it used to be, with great value to be found in the apartments attached to the hotel. \u2022 Aifric Campbell&apos;s novel On the Floor is published by Serpent&apos;s Tail, \u00a37.99. to buy a copy for \u00a36.39 with free UK p&amp;p go to guardianbookshop.co.uk Jeremy Strong: Kalkan, Turkey     Photograph: Alamy    I have been coming here to unwind for years. Kalkan, at the foot of the Taurus mountains on Turkey&apos;s south-west coast, gives me the perfect mix of sun, sea, beach, town, ruins, history, fabulous food and, above all, some of the nicest people I have met. Kalkan started as a sleepy fishing village and has now embraced tourism in a welcoming but careful manner. High-rise buildings are not permitted, and the peaceful old heart of Kalkan town, bursting with bougainvillea, remains. The roads and paths wind down into the pretty harbour, big enough for a couple of two-masted gulets but mostly filled with smaller converted fishing boats that will take you out for a day&apos;s swimming and snorkelling around the islands and further beaches. There are plenty of delightful shops and, even better, restaurants \u2013 around 100 or so of them. Turkey is famed for its food, and Kalkan excels. Behind lie the green mountains, staggeringly landscapes and Turkey&apos;s ancient history. We love it. \u2022 Jeremy Strong is a children&apos;s author.

Every holiday since my mid-teens has been spent in the mountain village of Deia. Perched above the Mediterranean, it has continually drawn me back over the past two decades with its stunning views and free accommodation. That latter comes courtesy of my mum, who now lives there full-time. Her presence, and that of so many pivotal memories, means that I tend to regress to my 16-year-old grumpy self. I&apos;m sure she doesn&apos;t enjoy my return to a state of one-word answers and eye-rolling churlishness, and who knows what the hell my wife and three kids make of it. My personality is constantly flip-flopping, and it can be difficult remembering which role I&apos;m meant to be playing at any given moment: responsible, loving dad or selfish immature mutterer, like my father. The saint, aka my wife, has become used to my Jekyll-and-Hyde act. It must also be strange for her to holiday among my entire sexual history, though she gets on pretty well with both of them. We first met, and I later proposed, among the rocks on Deia&apos;s beach \u2013 she guessed something was up after I didn&apos;t split the lunch bill \u2013 so playing there with our children feels like a natural and privileged continuation. I must admit, I do sometimes stare with longing and jealousy at the rocks at the far end of the cove. It&apos;s a place I no longer belong, where the non-balding, thin, carefree teenagers that replaced my generation congregate. Drinking in the town&apos;s one real bar, Cafe Sa Fonda, among rich and poor, famous and non-famous, young and old, there are moments I almost feel as though I&apos;ve travelled back in time. Though now if I&apos;m up all night, it&apos;s because the baby has colic. \u2022 Stand-up comedian Josh Howie is currently on tour in the UK (ents24.com)", "publicationDate": "2013-08-09T20:00:00Z", "tags": ["Summer holidays", "Family holidays", "Travel"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/aug/09/travel-writers-summer-holiday-traditions", "title": "Holiday traditions: writers reveal their rituals and the places they return to", "sentences": ["Yet I step into an internet cafe in Bangkok, at 3.16am, and a door to surprise and a distinctive culture swings open."]}, {"article": "In the two weeks since he\u00a0left for Vietnam, the\u00a0oldest has offered up\u00a0a single fragment of\u00a0communication \u2013 a\u00a0Facebook message consisting, in its entirety, of the word &quot;YO&quot;. This was to be expected \u2013 I\u00a0remember being his age well enough to understand that to experience independence from one&apos;s parents they must, at least temporarily, be dead to you \u2013 but I\u00a0also knew my wife would not leave\u00a0it at that. &quot;I&apos;ve found him,&quot; she says one morning, prodding me awake. &quot;He&apos;s\u00a0in Laos.&quot; It&apos;s clear that she has\u00a0been up for some time, possibly all night. What she has actually found is the blog of a twentysomething Australian IT consultant called John.\u00a0John is from Bondi Beach and likes running, wine, movies and opera singing. His favourite films include Star Wars, Alien and Whistle\u00a0Down The Wind. He has travelled extensively through south-east Asia, and it is a mere coincidence that he finds himself on the same five-day guided tour of\u00a0Laos as my oldest son. I&apos;m not sure how my wife found the blog, but when I went looking for it later all I had to do was type the oldest one&apos;s name and &quot;Laos&quot; into Google. It&apos;s a fairly exhaustive chronicle \u2013 part travelogue, part potted history, part food diary \u2013 with plenty of pictures: landscapes, temples, John sampling a glass from a clear jug of rice wine in which several bear paws are steeping. The middle section includes a long account of a boat trip up the muddy Mekong river. It&apos;s a bit like the screenplay for Apocalypse Now, but with more exclamation marks and the prices of all the drinks listed in Australian dollars. My wife and I pore over each new upload with a combination of fascination and frustration. Our son is a very minor character in John&apos;s narrative. He occasionally turns up in a picture, one of 20 tourists seated round a restaurant table, or at the far left of a posed group in a\u00a0cave, smiling, with a torch strapped to his forehead. &quot;He&apos;s changing his shirt,&quot; I say. &quot;That&apos;s good.&quot; &quot;Are you sure that&apos;s the back of his head?&quot; my wife says. He&apos;s name-checked on one or two occasions, but in the most recent entries he doesn&apos;t figure at all, unless you count oblique references to &quot;the rest of the group&quot;. We know he&apos;s seen a jug of rice wine with bear paws floating in it, but we don&apos;t know if he had any. &quot;At least we know he&apos;s OK,&quot; I say. &quot;How do we know that?&quot; my wife\u00a0says. &quot;Because if anything terrible happened, it would definitely be interesting enough to earn a\u00a0mention from John.&quot; Sadly the day comes when the tour ends and the oldest one and John part company.

Her husband chips in, &quot;What time does the bingo start?&quot;  This is the Dare Protoplay festival in Dundee, an annual celebration of game development, held in and around the town&apos;s historic Caird Hall. Usually, this grand building is a concert venue (forthcoming attractions include Jayne MacDonald and the Ladyboys of Bangkok - sadly not performing together), but last week it was filled with stands showing off new game titles developed by local studios. Entry is always free and open to all \u2013 some visitors are enthusiastic gamers, others have come in out of curiosity or to escape the persistent drizzle. All will have learned something about the state of the Scottish games industry. How different would E3 be if it were visited, not just by industry insiders deadened to the homogenous banality of it all, but also by mums with prams, and kids, and grandparents?  But this is not the main draw. Each year, the University of Abertay&apos;s Dare to be Digital competition challenges students from all over the world to make a game in nine weeks. Teams must submit their concepts in January, and from all the entries, a panel of industry veterans selects 15 finalists \u2013 these small groups of youngsters then spend a couple of months in Dundee, writing their games from scratch, aided by a coterie of experienced mentors. The resulting entries are then shown off in a huge marquee erected on the town square. Anyone can come in, play games, and vote on their favourites - however, the three titles favoured by the official judges go on to compete for a Bafta award.  This year&apos;s selection was admirably diverse and accomplished. There were puzzlers, shooters, experiential flying games, and of course, augmented reality dinosaur fast food simulations. Most have been written using the cross-platform development engine Unity, which now seems almost ubiquitous in the indie games community. It allows very fast prototyping of ideas, and also ports easily, so the same code will run on smartphones, consoles and tablets with minimal tweaking. As a result, developers can spend more time on ideas and gameplay and less on technical groundwork. According to one of the judges I spoke to, most of these teams had their games up and running within two weeks \u2013 the rest of the time has been spent on iteration and polish.     Milkshake Rush    There were plenty of ideas on show at Dare 2013. Escape from Dr Nomerac&apos;s Lair is a chaotic co-op platformer with decent cartoon visuals and some intriguing competitive elements \u2013 another co-operative title, The Deep features gorgeous aquatic environments, where fish swoop for plankton and tentacled monsters lurk in hidden caves. Milkshake Rush is a enjoyably effervescent combination of Diner Dash, Cooking Mama and Fruit Ninja, with visuals heavily inspired, says artist Jane Barrie, by Pendelton Ward.  Then there are the augmented reality games. DinerSaur has you serving snacks to prehistoric creatures while zapping food thieves, while the impressive Pygmy Panic is a tower defense game in which a diminutive creature must be protected from hordes of invading monsters. Here, the AR element provides you with a really tactile overview of your battle arena, bringing a new UI/UX element to a familiar genre. Throughout each day, the stands were swarming with enthusiastic kids and competitive teens, hustling for highscores and grabbing at the bowls of sweets that several teams had sensibly placed next to their monitors and demo tablets. As with Nottingham&apos;s similarly egalitarian GameCity, there was mutual respect and enthusiasm between visitors and exhibitors. On Saturday, iKnow, the team behind rotating platformer The Unknown, tweeted that one young girl had spent over an hour completing their game, before returning the next day with a picture she&apos;d drawn of the lead character. &quot;Our first fan art!&quot; they joyously proclaimed.            The best entry, though, was Size Dos Matter, a fiendishly addictive combination of Tetris and Guitar Hero in which players navigate an expandable block through a series barriers, changing its size to fit the gap available. It&apos;s an intense twitch core treat, with an interesting rhythm action element (you have to re-size your shape in time to the music) and lovely, minimalistic visuals. The Norwegian development team excitedly namecheck Super Hexagon as an inspiration, and their title has that same sense of compulsion and purity. it&apos;s very much designed for tablets, but Sony should snap this up for Vita. Team Dos is also planning a PC version, which will allow gamers to use their own music to provide the interactive soundtrack. Meanwhile, back in Caird Hall, a selection of local professional studios were also drawing in hundreds of gamers. I liked the Pilot Wings-style tablet game Wee Paper Planes from Pixel Blimp, a simple flight sim with intuitive motion controls and quaintly drawn environments.             Coolson&apos;s Artisanal Chocolate Factory, meanwhile, is a beautifully stylised word game in which players have to package chocolates with letters on top into differently shaped boxes. Naturally, all the letters have to spell out words, and with the production line of chocs moving ceaselessly on, quick spelling is a must. Developed by husband and wife team Things Made Out of Other Things, the game is out now on the App Store.      Glitchspace    Elsewhere, there was the minimalist cyberpunk strategy sim Wetware from Reality Council, in which you control a global mega-corp hacking into rival systems to steal secrets and crash their info nodes. I also liked the bright, abstract aesthetic of Glitchspace by burgeoning studio Space Budgie, which looks like an ambitious combination of Portal, Minecraft and Mirror&apos;s Edge. The central conceit seems to be that the player must learn a visual programming language in order to manipulate and explore the environment, but the title is so early in development the team seems unsure of exactly how it&apos;ll work. We&apos;ll keep an eye on it. For me, the highlight of the indie hall was Dungeon Run, a hugely compelling combination of Grim Joggers, Cannon Fodder and a rogue-like RPG. At the start of the game, you control a small squad of treasure seekers, tapping the screen to guide the whole bunch of them. The procedurally generated environments are filled with chests, monsters and traps, and the idea is to explore as far as possible before all the tomb raiders are killed.      Dungeon Run    There&apos;s a twist to the permadeath set-up though. At the end of each bout, the player earns XP, which can be used to level-up the next batch of disposable explorers before starting again \u2013 it&apos;s a smart way of adding depth and encouraging immediate re-play. Set to launch on iOS and Android later this year, Dungeon Run is developed by indie coder Stew Hogarth who came up with the concept during a freelance stint at Dundee-based developer Proper Games. &quot;I was working on a game called Tile Temple Tactics, when they did a company game jam,&quot; explains Hogarth. &quot;I participated \u2013 because I love jams \u2013 and came up with Dungeon Run. Proper Games loved the concept, and wanted to fund the full development. I agreed for a percentage of the revenue. It&apos;s a win win win situation really!&quot; As part of the festival, Abertay university also arranged a series of interesting talks and panel sessions. For young developers looking for industry advice, there was Sony XDEV producer Neil McPhillips and DMA old boy Colin MacDonald now the games commissioner at Channel 4. There was Ian Livingstone reminiscing over his life in games of all sorts, there was Philip Long, director of the forthcoming V&amp;A at Dundee, talking about the museum&apos;s creative outreach ambitions.  Flying in from the States on Saturday, veteran game designer Jessie Schell provided the highlight \u2013 an engrossing rumination on the power of Touch interfaces. Schell theorised that, via a combination of virtual reality and robotics, the future of gaming could well be interfaces that reach out to touch us right back. He also demonstrated the unconscious power of touch by skilfully spinning a metal tray on one finger for several minutes \u2013 which in itself drew a hearty appal use from the audience. It was fascinating stuff \u2013 and Schell will be staying in Scotland to attend Edinburgh&apos;s hugely promising Turing Festival. On Sunday afternoon, the three finalists of the Dare to be Digital competition were announced. Team Dos, Team iKnow and Mazhlele (with their multiplayer maze game, Project Heera) will all be competing for the Ones to watch award at the next video game Baftas. There were other awards too: Kaleidoscope Games won the audience vote with The Deep; Lunavark claimed the artistic achievement and team awards for its surreal vertical scroller, Cosmic Couch; and Team Dos got the Channel 4 award. All will no doubt attract the attention of companies like Sony, Sega, Jagex and Ubisoft who sent mentors and judges. On the first day of the festival, I chatted briefly with Professor Louis Natanson of Abertay uni. Twenty years ago, he taught Dave Jones, the found of DMA design and co-creator of Lemmings, how to code. I asked him why dare to be Digital was important to the university, and to the Scottish games industry in general. &quot;It&apos;s about the reputation of the University, of course,&quot; he explained. &quot;But it is also about opening the minds of young people to the fact that they can make games. It is about demonstrating to society and to parents \u2013 who are a key influencers on their children \u2013 that the games industry is a serious thing.&quot;  It is a serious thing, but over the last four days, the 10,000 people who wandered through the Caird Hall and the Dare marquee, also revelled in the fun and creativity of the industry. Even the ones too worried about technology to touch an iPad will have seen their children and grandchildren enthusiastically taking part, and they will have spoken to the smart approachable students and indie coders who made these games. This is a festival all about beginnings; there is potential in all of them.", "publicationDate": "2013-08-12T07:27:00Z", "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Game culture", "Events", "Indie games", "Culture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/aug/12/dare-protoplay-2013", "title": "Dare Protoplay 2013 \u2013 the event, the games and the winners", "sentences": ["Usually, this grand building is a concert venue (forthcoming attractions include Jayne MacDonald and the Ladyboys of Bangkok - sadly not performing together), but last week it was filled with stands showing off new game titles developed by local studios."]}, {"article": "For a growing number of Australians backpacking around Asia, visiting Angkor Wat or buying a Bintang T-shirt is being supplemented with a less conventional activity: defrauding people back in Australia via a hothouse-style call centre. The Australian Crime Commission has warned that &quot;boiler room&apos;&apos; scam networks across Asia are becoming increasingly sophisticated, employing Australian backpackers and expats to add credibility to nefarious cold calls. The ACC said that it aided Thai authorities in the raid of a network in Bangkok in April that was responsible for stealing more than $50m from Australians. Police discovered nine Australians with lists of their compatriots to call with carefully crafted scripts. Last year, the ACC said 2,600 Australians had lost at least $113m from offshore cold call scams in the previous five years, although it said this estimate was conservative. &quot;There&apos;s real diversity in these boiler rooms and some Australians are now making careers out of it because they know there are profits to be made from the commissions if they are good at it,&quot; Warren Gray, NSW manager at the ACC, told Guardian Australia. &quot;The difficulty is that in offshore jurisdictions it&apos;s hard for us to prosecute. Some of those higher up the chain are Australian and think it&apos;s far less risky for them to operate overseas. But we are certainly trying to deter and disrupt this activity. &quot;These places use people from Australia, Canada and Britain because the people who get the calls are far less wary if they hear a familiar accent. They use VOIP to hide where they are calling from, too.&quot; Gray said that the scams, which emanated from call centres across Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, were increasingly sophisticated and chose their targets carefully. Australia had become a bigger target due to its relative economic stability. &quot;Baby boomers are often the targets, especially those who have already invested and may have lost a bit of money in the global financial crisis,&quot; he said. &quot;Our psychological people have looked at the scripts and it&apos;s clear that they have been honed over many years. These scripts have a number of very clever hooks to get people involved. &quot;People are sold fictitious shares in businesses and can then log onto a website to see the shares go up and down. Some of the sites even have links to fake corporate regulators.&quot; Gray said the average loss from such scams was $130,000, with one person handing over $4m. The ACC advises people to hang up on cold calls offering overseas investments. ASIC also has a list of known unlicensed cold callers and other scam-related information that the public can check.

I glance up. The band have reached the bit in the choreography where they whip their backsides. The programme isn&apos;t kidding. Whatever I was expecting from the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo, it wasn&apos;t this. For me and many festivalgoers, the Tattoo is an obscure ritual that takes place in a vast steel beer crate perched on top of Edinburgh Castle. The closest most of us get to it is remembering to avoid the Royal Mile between the hours of 8pm and 11pm, because of the queue (this goes with remembering to avoid the Royal Mile between the hours of midnight and 7.59pm, because of everything else). I&apos;ve seen glimpses of it on TV, even wangled a ticket years ago, but promptly decamped in confusion. Who knows what dreadful things the full event involves? Marching bands and gun salutes? Mock rendition flights? Simulated waterboarding? If the weather isn&apos;t awful, watching the culminating fireworks from Princes Street is pretty. The nightly teeth-rattling flypast by RAF fast jets is somewhat less so. During the Edinburgh festivals season, though, there might as well only be one show in town. The Tattoo has a cast of almost 1,000. It&apos;s seen by about 8,800 people a night, totalling 220,000 each year, 30% of them travelling from overseas for the occasion. Another 100m worldwide are expected to tune in to the BBC&apos;s annual broadcast. And 95% of tickets are gone months in advance (the Tattoo sold out earlier this week). These are figures to make a comedy promoter weep hot tears of envy; Puppetry of the Penis and Lady Boys of Bangkok could retire, on a tiny fraction of the proceeds, and set up rival golf franchises in the Highlands. So perhaps it is time that I, despite my mistrust of military spectacle, my reactionary republicanism, my dislike of uniforms, guns, loud bangs, being on time, see what all the fuss is about. This year, in the name of art, the Guardian can go to the Tattoo. 102.2m people a year can&apos;t be wrong. Can they? So, instead of avoiding the queue, I join it. We are a peaceable and stoutly shod crowd, beneath skies the colour and texture of three-day-old porridge. Everyone apart from me looks equipped for a picnic in February, or perhaps a modest Arctic expedition. There is a skittish north-westerly breeze starting to whip down the Royal Mile, carrying with it the sweet smell of the brewery. Nina and her daughter Sigrid have travelled from Obernau in Germany; they bought their tickets six months ago, having watched the Tattoo for many years on television. A little further up the line, Ann from Rotherham is suffering from having waited for an hour (&quot;I&apos;ll be honest with you, love,&quot; she says, &quot;I&apos;m in agony&quot;), but is soldiering on courageously regardless, wearing a purple tartan cap with orange pigtails. This evening is her Christmas present. Suddenly the stewards lift the barriers, and we all surge towards the castle gates. There is a holiday atmosphere, or as much of one as can be summoned in a medieval bull-run guarded by military police next to the Scotch Whisky Experience. The man at the centre of it all, Brigadier David Allfrey, has run the Tattoo since 2010. Tonight Allfrey is in civvies (if you count tomato-red tartan trousers and a dinner jacket as civvies), but has the kind of crisp bearing that makes you immediately notice the slouch in your shoulders. His rounded forehead gleams beneath the castle braziers. His Sandhurst vowels scythe cheerfully through the wind. I sense him scrutinising my trainers. So what actually is the Tattoo? &quot;An extraordinary blend of the values and standards of our military, the constitution, and popular taste.&quot; He switches his gaze from my trainers to my notepad. &quot;Is it high art? No, it&apos;s not. But there are elements of this that you will find, I hope, really artistic. The youngest member of the cast is about six, the oldest is just short of 80, and that matches the demographic of the audience. We&apos;re trying to give a little bit of everything to everybody.&quot;     Horsing around \u2026 the equine puppet from the West End show War Horse makes an appearance. Photograph: Katie-Lee Arrowsmith / Hemedia    That includes, this year, military bands from as far afield as South Korea, Mexico and the Mongolian armed forces. Even the hornet buzz of the massed pipes and drums has a globalised feel: marching alongside the Irish Guards, the Scots Guards and the Black Watch are pipers from Oman and Malta (the last sporting vermilion tartans that fluoresce wantonly beneath the spotlights). After a motorcycle display team composed \u2013 hair-raisingly \u2013 of crimson-jacketed young boys, the arena is given over to the Gangnam-loving New Zealanders, who are soon joined by a phalanx of scissor-kicking girls, with gleaming boots the hue of their teeth. Together they make an audacious assault on the theme from Star Wars. I&apos;m interested, to put it mildly, by the cost \u2013 partly because, as a UK taxpayer, I am footing part of the bill. Production expenses are about \u00a32.5m, says Allfrey, but the Tattoo receives no direct funding; other governments lend their forces, the Ministry of Defence pays in kind, with loans of people and materiel (not insubstantial: three military bands for a month, pipers from across the army, a full regiment in support). I&apos;m guessing the fighter jets don&apos;t come cheap. &quot;They&apos;re returning from a training sortie,&quot; insists Allfrey. &quot;We just persuade the RAF to slingshot them in across the Bass Rock at the required time.&quot; But isn&apos;t this just shameless military PR, a way of brainwashing a complaisant public about the need for new aircraft carriers and a permanent nuclear deterrent? Allfrey doesn&apos;t exactly deny it, but the Tattoo, he adds, is non-profit-making, and proceeds are ploughed back into the Scottish economy. Along with military charities, the Edinburgh international festival and Scottish Opera received about \u00a3300,000 last year \u2013 raising the intriguing thought that the Taiwanese adaptation of Kafka I watched immediately beforehand was part-funded by the MoD. The thing Allfrey is proudest of is his concept, which has been deployed with an exactness the most unbending European director would admire. This year, for the 64th Tattoo, the theme is Our Wonderful World, which fits alongside the tourist board&apos;s Year of Natural Scotland. Placed within the overarching theme is a journey through the seasons, night and day, even featuring the creation of the universe and the forging of the Castle Mound from molten lava. (Scottish historians will be pleased to note that the dawn of geological time was attended by pipers.) Isn&apos;t it all a bit touchy-feely? Allfrey looks almost offended. &quot;You take the philosophy of 8,800 people, all from different places, and by the end of the evening they&apos;re all holding hands, singing Auld Lang Syne. That is actually quite&quot; \u2013 he rummages for a word that will resonate with a suspicious Guardian journalist \u2013 &quot;cool.&quot; Is it theatre, I wonder. &quot;Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely it is theatre. Many people believe that military people are brutish things that either live on the ground or fly in the air or wallow about in the oceans, but actually all servicemen have to be artistic, because if you approach an enemy in a cloddish way, you will not win.&quot; &quot;Most servicemen,&quot; he adds, &quot;have quite a lot of artistry about them.&quot; If this talk is more showbiz than I&apos;m expecting, perhaps it&apos;s the temporary injection of some genuine West End glitz. This year the National Theatre has lent one of the full-size equine puppets from War Horse; canny PR, no doubt, but impressively done all the same. At the climax of the evening, the puppet noses its way down the assembled soldiers, before rearing on its hind legs before the audience: a ghost from the military past saluting the present. I meet the three puppeteers in a Portakabin after the show; they seem enjoyably bewildered by the whole experience \u2013 even if, one admits, it wasn&apos;t exactly how he expected to make his Edinburgh festival debut. Overall, there are fewer whizz-bangs than I&apos;d feared; in fact, the only weapons I glimpse \u2013 if you discount the jets \u2013 are clutched by the Black Watch, who proffer them during the final salute. The concluding note is of solemn remembrance. Perhaps, given that British forces have been bogged down in a series of controversial conflicts for over a decade now, the time for war games has passed. &quot;Almost all of us have lost friends and comrades,&quot; says Allfrey. &quot;There&apos;s an opportunity to reflect.&quot; Next year, with the centenary of the beginning of the first world war, there will be even more reflection; Allfrey hints that they&apos;re working on something big with the international festival, so far under wraps. By the time it&apos;s all over, once I have detached the pen from my frozen and cramped fingers, I&apos;m not exactly racing to take the Queen&apos;s shilling. I am not yearning to march with the drums and the trumpets. But I am surprised \u2013 a little alarmed \u2013 to find I enjoyed myself. Perhaps it&apos;s simply the setting, or the exhilaration of a huge mass event. You could even blame the Kiwis and their Gangnam style. But was there a momentary moistness in my eye at the sight of a lone piper, spotlit high on the castle ramparts next to Scotland&apos;s national war memorial, surrounded by countless glimmering tiny screens? Could be.

Blair will instead see only his travel and accommodation costs covered, Thailand&apos;s ministry of foreign affairs told the Guardian, in keeping with most other speakers. The former British prime minister is one of a number of high-profile leaders to be invited to discuss peace and negotiation at the Uniting for the Future forum in September. Joining him on stage will be Priscilla Hayner, an expert in truth commissions and transitional justice, and Martti Ahtisaari, the former Finnish president and Nobel laureate who is noted for his international peace work. The former UN secretary general Kofi Annan declined the invitation. The Thai prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, has said the forum, which is to include local and foreign leaders, could help &quot;introduce a positive and forward-looking climate&quot; to Thailand, which deeply divided between those who support her government and those who fear her party is merely attempting to bring back her brother and former premier Thaksin. Thaksin is a deeply divisive figure who has been living in self-imposed exile since he was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and charged with conflict of interest. A recent amnesty bill absolving those arrested, charged and prosecuted for any political activities after the coup triggered thousands to protest in the streets in Bangkok last week, amid fears that the legislation would pave the way for Thaksin&apos;s return.

Good old Leighton Baines, still doing the right things, quietly going about his business, despite having known for pretty much the entire summer he has the chance to go to Manchester United but Everton are doing all they can to put the shutters down. No complaining, no scams, no injuries of convenience, even though it is probably safe to assume he is quite intrigued by the idea of joining David Moyes and everything that comes with the upgrade. There&apos;s an element of educated guesswork here, on the basis that Baines has kept his feelings to himself, but he could hardly not be interested when Old Trafford presents so many attractions. A huge jump in salary is only one of them. A move to Manchester means playing in the Champions League, challenging for trophies and working, again, for a manager who clearly gets the best out of him. It also offers a much better chance of ousting Ashley Cole from the England team on a permanent basis, with a World\u00a0Cup to come next summer. Yet he has not forced the issue. He does not have a team of people working in the shadows to put pressure on Everton, planting stories, kicking up a stink. Baines has just carried on as he was: head down, working hard, reminding us it is possible to be a great footballer and a great football man. It is a different set of principles he is applying to some of his peers, absolutely refusing to take on his own club when you just know there will be people in his profession looking his way and wondering why on earth he is being so old-fashioned and naive. Robbie Savage blew whatever remained of their cover with his handy 11-point guide, published under the title &quot;Footballers&apos; Tricks to Engineer a Transfer&quot; on the BBC website and well worth a read if you want a crash course in the kind of professional spin, bluff and counter-bluff that has been served up this summer. The different headings \u2014 Sulk, Stop Communicating, Fake Injury, Use the Media and Undermine the Manager and the like \u2013 will give you a pretty good idea about what to expect. You may not be keen on Savage, and you may not like what he writes, but I actually quite appreciate a bit of truth\u2011telling. It is the system that stinks. Gareth Bale, like Baines, has not said anything this summer. That, however, is where the similarities end. Bale, we are told, is &quot;distraught&quot; and &quot;horrified&quot; he is still waiting for Tottenham to accept Real Madrid&apos;s gold. Spurs claim he has a genuine injury, while various newspapers have been informed he is not particularly interested in playing anyway and already thinking about Tottenham in the past tense. All we can say for certain is that he will not play before the transfer window closes. He has a &quot;pain in his foot,&quot; according to Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, and &quot;doesn&apos;t speak&quot;. Bale is learning Spanish and his agent, Jonathan Barnett, suddenly appears to have Marca TV on speed-dial. Put it all together and it is not difficult to see what is going on. In fact, it is about as transparent as it gets. This, increasingly, seems to be the modern-day strategy when a player wants to get his own way: back the club into a corner, then sit tight, play a clever game with the media and hope the chairman eventually caves in. Baines stands out simply because he does not go in for all the politics and games. But the fact he is the exception, rather than the norm, probably does not say a great deal for footballers at this level. Or the people waiting for their five or 10% commission and telling their clients what to do next. Wayne Rooney is a case in point. His agent, Paul Stretford, to use Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s description, is &quot;not the most popular man&quot; at Old Trafford. Yet Rooney sometimes appears to be in thrall of him. &quot;It&apos;s like dad and son,&quot; as someone closely involved put it a few days ago. &quot;It&apos;s nothing like the usual player and agent relationship.&quot; And Stretford, for the most part, is clearly used to getting his own way. He is not someone I know well but I have been flicking through Stan Collymore&apos;s autobiography over the past few days and it offers his own insight into what it is like being a Stretford client. Published in 2004, shortly after Rooney moved to United, it also has some advice for the teenager. &quot;I hope Rooney knows what kind of animal Stretford is,&quot; he writes. &quot;I hope he doesn&apos;t fall for all the emotional shit.&quot; Collymore remembers Stretford going from being &quot;a thorough, professional, understated guy to this horrible parody of an agent&quot;, wearing a long Gucci coat and sunglasses and christened, behind his back, as &quot;Toad&quot; by the player&apos;s mates, because he reminded them of the character from The Wind in the Willows. That may sound fairly inconsequential. Yet Collymore also came to think of himself as &quot;a doormat&quot; as far as Stretford was concerned and, explaining why he eventually severed all ties, depicts him as a deeply manipulative character.\u00a0&quot;I had always done whatever he said. I said yes to all sorts of things, often without looking at them. I allowed the line between him being my surrogate father and my agent to become blurred. And he played on that big-time. He abused it. My relationship with him was unhealthily dependent and he milked it for all it was worth.&quot; One time, shortly after Collymore had moved from Liverpool to Aston Villa, he says he took a telephone call from Stretford begging for money. &quot;His business was expanding and he had calculated I owed him \u00a380,000.&quot; Collymore says he ran some checks and worked out he did not owe a penny. &quot;A couple of days later Stretford rang again. This time he was near enough in tears. He said: &apos;You do love me, don&apos;t you Stan?&apos;&quot; Collymore wrote a cheque because &quot;that was the kind of hold he had over me&quot;. This time, however, Stretford is not going to get what he and his client want. United, as the Guardian revealed last week, are not going to let Rooney join Chelsea, no matter how many roubles Roman Abramovich chucks at it or what the player and his agent cook up next. Hopefully Liverpool will stick to what they say regarding Luis Su\u00e1rez and, between them, the two clubs can show that sometimes it does not matter how much a player stamps his feet. It is not going to change the culture but it would be a break from the norm \u2013 and that is not a bad thing at all. Bale is a slightly different situation because of the sheer amount of money involved and the fact Spurs would not be selling to a direct rival. On that basis, it is going to be extremely hard for Daniel Levy to turn down a world-record transfer (a friend of mine, with connections to the Bernab\u00e9u, reports back that Madrid have already pre\u2011ordered 50,000 shirts with Bale&apos;s name emblazoned across the back). Yet the Spurs chairman, just like his counterparts at Old Trafford and Anfield, is entitled to be aggrieved given the way the player and his Mr Fixit have gone about it and it is not totally out of the question Bale, Su\u00e1rez and Rooney will all discover that player-power isn&apos;t this season&apos;s fashion. Maybe \u2013 and this would be an irony \u2013 Baines will be the only one of the lot to go. One thing&apos;s for certain: it is a shame there are not more like him. Club tours, jet lag and the 2014 World Cup That was a poor piece of defending from Gary Cahill for Scotland&apos;s second goal at Wembley, even if it was a wonderfully taken shot from Kenny Miller, but it is no real surprise the England centre\u2011half was not at his best, considering he had flown in from Chelsea&apos;s pre-season trip to the US the day before and was probably still trying to shake his head clear of jet lag. Chelsea were based in Washington, playing one game there and then making round trips to Indianapolis, New York and Miami for their other tour matches. Before that, they spent 15\u00a0days on their first summer tour, playing in Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and\u00a0Jakarta. In total, they reckon they have flown something like 24,600 air miles. Or, to put it another way, just short of the world&apos;s circumference. That is a long pre-season any year but especially if you remember they played 69 games last season then, in Cahill&apos;s case, he went straight into England&apos;s friendly against Republic of Ireland and then the four\u2011day trip to Brazil. It all part of the modern game \u2013 Manchester United, for example, have played in Bangkok, Sydney, Yokohama, Osaka and Stockholm \u2013 but it does make you wonder what kind of condition these players are going to be in if England actually qualify for the 2014 World Cup. On their knees, you would imagine. Saga of West Ham shirt &apos;sweetener&apos;Futre refused to just make up the numOnly 10 was perfect for furious Futre Antonio Valencia&apos;s decision to abandon the number 7 at Manchester United this season, directly linking the pressure of taking Cristiano Ronaldo&apos;s old shirt to his deterioration in form last season, reminds me of a story Harry Redknapp used to tell about when he was managing West Ham and had just brought Paulo Futre to the club. Futre was allocated the No16 shirt when he turned up for his debut, at Arsenal, but regarded it as insult and refused to get changed. &quot;Futre,&quot; he started shouting, pointing to his chest. &quot;Futre, No10.&quot; Redknapp tried to talk him round but it turned into an argument and Futre was having none of it. &quot;No fucking 16,&quot; he carried on. &quot;Fuck off. No 10, no play.&quot; True to his word, he then stormed out of Highbury and took a cab back to his hotel. The following Monday he turned up (with a lawyer) at Upton Park and offered to pay \u00a3100,000 for his favourite number. Redknapp, by his own admission, was on the point of throttling him by that stage but eventually agreed to talk to John Moncur to see if he was willing to give it up. So Futre offered another sweetener. &quot;He owned a villa, reportedly one of the most luxurious in Portugal, on a cliff-top on the coast and offered Moncur a fortnight there free if he handed over his shirt,&quot; Redknapp recalls. &quot;To be honest, I don&apos;t think Moncur gave a monkey&apos;s what number he wore but he took the free holiday.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-08-17T21:00:03Z", "tags": ["Transfer window", "David Moyes", "Luis Su\u00e1rez", "Gareth Bale", "Paul Stretford", "Stan Collymore", "Football"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/aug/17/leighton-baines-transfer-window", "title": "Leighton Baines is the Premier League role model for transfer window | Daniel Taylor", "sentences": ["Before that, they spent 15\u00a0days on their first summer tour, playing in Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and\u00a0Jakarta.", "It all part of the modern game \u2013 Manchester United, for example, have played in Bangkok, Sydney, Yokohama, Osaka and Stockholm \u2013 but it does make you wonder what kind of condition these players are going to be in if England actually qualify for the 2014 World Cup."]}, {"article": "Under the Dome10pm, Channel 5 Stephen King is behind this new mystery drama, in which an unexplained event cuts off the remote town of Chester&apos;s Mill from the outside world, from airspace down.

Within the first few minutes there is the sneaky cigarette during morning register, the bathroom quickie during break time, the mindless chatter about who likes whom, the agony of a boring lecture, and the impending suspension of a handsome bad boy. Day-to-day life in Thailand is still largely conservative, with programming revolving around game shows and anodyne soap operas, and sex education\u00a0premised on abstinence over birth control. Which is why, much like Skins did in Britain, Hormones has struck a nerve in Thailand, where fans appreciate its honesty and critics lambast its &quot;reckless&quot; scenes of youths smoking and kissing on-screen. Officials have even called for outright censorship, but its director, Songyos Sugmakanan, says the series plays an integral part in Thailand&apos;s culture, primarily because the issues it touches upon \u2013 teenage sex, drugs and general hormonal confusion \u2013 are not usually discussed at home or in school. &quot;Thai society has been closed for a long time,&quot; said Sugmakanan, 39. &quot;In my day adults chose not to teach us about sex in the classroom because they feared it would lead to us having sex, when actually it just forced kids to go out and learn on their own.&quot; Thailand has the second-highest number of teen pregnancies in the world, year-on-year increasing rates of STD infection among its youth, and the highest rate of HIV/Aids in Asia. While sex education is mandatory, teaching the subject is limited to eight hours a year, with campaigners claiming that conservative teachers often fail to address essential issues such as how to practise safe sex, preferring to focus on abstinence. Hormones portrays this modern-day dilemma through contrasting characters. In one episode the self-aware, sexually advanced Sprite storms off after a boy refuses to produce a condom during a classroom-based rendezvous, while later the mollycoddled, naive Dow is forced to visit an illegal abortion clinic after losing her virginity. Such scenes have angered the National Broadcast and Telecommunication Committee, which wants them censored for being too &quot;obscene&quot;. But Sugmakanan says avoiding such subjects would be another example of &quot;adults closing their eyes&quot; to reality. &quot;The abortion rate here is so high \u2013 the teenage figure is around 100,000 every year. It&apos;s impossible not to talk about safe sex,&quot; he argues. The series, which is the first of its kind in Thailand, has proven hugely popular, ranking third behind two major terrestrial channels during its Saturday night slot. A second series is slated for air next year. Non-cable viewers are able to catch each week&apos;s episode on YouTube the next day, where some episodes have reached more than 9m views. Sugmakanan says that parents often watch with their teens to get an idea of what school life may entail. With each episode themed around a particular hormone \u2013 such as testosterone or oestrogen \u2013 the series follows nine characters, from heartthrobs and goody-two-shoes to wannabe musicians and tomboys. As topical issues are woven neatly into the script, including single parenthood, abortion, homosexuality and class bullying, the series has been lauded as &quot;quality, thought-provoking programming&quot; that could change not only the way Thais see TV, but their own culture as well. &quot;Hormones is based on real-life problems in Thailand, but that&apos;s scary to most people,&quot; said Jaded Chaowilai of the Women and Men Progressive Movement Foundation, which campaigns for greater sex education in\u00a0schools. &quot;We cannot talk openly about sex education in Thai society, so most of the\u00a0youth don&apos;t know what they&apos;re doing when they have sex. Most of the young women have abortions because they don&apos;t know how to protect themselves \u2013 they don&apos;t even know how to use condoms.&quot; Unsumalin Sirasakpatharamaetha, 22, who plays class president Khwan in the series, says most of the characters are based on real people, with many of the actors incorporating their own life experiences into the series. &quot;The aim is to provoke the audience to think, and because it acts like a mirror\u00a0for teens, they know what can happen with each path they might take, and from that learn what to do,&quot; she\u00a0says. &quot;Censorship is really only to protect those who can&apos;t think for themselves.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-08-19T13:28:11Z", "tags": ["The news on TV", "Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Sex education", "Schools", "Education", "Sex", "Life and style", "Television", "Culture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/aug/19/hormones-thailand-school-tv-drama-sex-drugs", "title": "Thailand's answer to Skins shocks some, thrills others", "sentences": ["     From the opening episode it becomes clear why Hormones, a drama of daily life at a Bangkok high school, has become the most talked about programme on Thai television."]}, {"article": "India&apos;s rupee hit another record low against the dollar on Wednesday, despite policymakers taking fresh measures to try to put a floor under the sliding currency and stave off a full-blown financial crisis. Until recently, India was constantly bracketed with China as an inexorably rising economic power; but with growth slowing sharply, the country is now among the hardest-hit of a string of developing countries that look dangerously exposed to violent swings in global markets. When central bankers embarked on the drastic policy of quantitative easing \u2013 untested on such a large scale \u2013 they always knew it was extremely risky but judged that the price of a prolonged slump across the rich world was greater than the threat of inflating unsustainable bubbles in the world&apos;s financial markets. That judgment is about to be put to the test. The Federal Reserve&apos;s $85bn (\u00a354.2bn)-a-month bond-buying spree unleashed a global tidal wave of cheap money, which flooded into emerging markets. Since May, when Fed chairman Ben Bernanke announced his plans to &quot;taper&quot;, and eventually halt, QE as the US recovers, these investment flows have gone into reverse. Governments in developing countries face plunging currencies and stock markets together with rising borrowing costs and some analysts are even starting to draw comparisons with the devastating Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. India Raghuram Rajan, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, faces a baptism of fire when he starts his new job as governor of the Indian central bank next month. With the rupee plunging to record lows against the dollar, the authorities in New Delhi face a severe test, trying to control the likely surge in inflation, as imports become more expensive, without clobbering growth. As Leif Eskesen of HSBC puts it, &quot;the balancing act between currency stabilisation and growth protection is not easy&quot;. So far, the authorities have merely stoked the rising sense of panic in financial markets. Their latest batch of policies, announced on Tuesday night, included a promise to inject liquidity into financial markets by buying $1.2bn-worth of bonds but brought only a brief period of calm before the sell-off resumed. If investors lose confidence in India&apos;s ability to fund its growing current account deficits, they could pile out of government bonds, pushing up interest rates across the board and squeezing the life out of the economy. Thailand Bangkok was the crucible of the Asian financial crisis that struck in 1997, as Thailand became the first country to call for help from the International Monetary Fund after a doomed (and costly) effort to defend its currency, the baht, against speculators. Few analysts believe the country faces a repeat of that chaotic period but fears about the outlook for Thailand were exacerbated earlier this week by news that its economy has slipped into recession. The 0.3% decline in GDP in the second quarter, following a 1.7% contraction between January and March, marked a dramatic turnaround from 6% growth last year. Bangkok&apos;s stock market saw a run-up of 50% between early 2011 and May; but even before investors&apos; &quot;taper tantrum&quot;, there had been doubts about the sustainability of its economic model, which has become increasingly reliant on rapid credit growth, with household debt rising to a worrying 80% of GDP. The Set index of leading Thai shares has dropped by more than 15% since May. Indonesia Indonesia&apos;s currency, the rupiah, has slipped to its lowest level against the dollar for four years, and share prices have plunged by more than 10% in the past week alone, as investors digest the risks that the Fed could soon start phasing out QE. As well as a reversal of investment flows, Indonesia is also being hit by falling commodity prices, sparked by concerns that China&apos;s economy is slowing. That helped the country&apos;s current account deficit to increase to 4.4% of GDP in the second quarter of this year \u2014 close to levels last seen in 1996, before the Asian financial crisis, and raising the alarming prospect of a balance of payments crisis if interest rates continue to rise. Indonesia looks particularly vulnerable to what economists call a &quot;sudden stop&quot; in capital flows, since as much as a third of its government bonds are owned by foreigners. During the late-90s crisis, Indonesia was forced to seek a $40bn bailout from the IMF. The controversial policies imposed in exchange for the rescue package sparked widespread protests, and led to the overthrow of the Suharto regime. Brazil Brazil came through the Great Recession of 2008-09 in relatively good shape, helping to feed market euphoria about a &quot;decoupling&quot; between the struggling West and fast-growing developing countries. Foreign investors poured $350bn into the country between 2003 and the end of last year in direct investments alone. But growth has slowed sharply in the past couple of years and the risks of a downturn have been exacerbated by the tremors rocking global markets. Dilma Rousseff&apos;s government has faced its own domestic political problems, including a spate of protests in June and July. But investors&apos; worries over the Fed&apos;s plans to withdraw QE \u2013 and fears of a slowdown in China, a major market for Brazil&apos;s critical commodity exports, have left analysts scrambling to downgrade their growth forecasts. Many expect growth of little more than 2% this year, and the Brazilian real has hit a four year low. A depreciation may be good news in the long term, helping to improve the country&apos;s trade performance; but in the short term, it will boost inflation, adding to the problems of the central bank, which has already been tightening policy to try and bring wage rises under control. China After a decade in which it joined the ranks of the world&apos;s economic superpowers, China&apos;s future growth path looks increasingly in doubt. Unlike many of its fellow emerging market players, China&apos;s financial markets remain only partially open to foreign investors, so it may be less at risk from a reversal in capital flows as a result of QE coming to an end. However, Beijing has plenty of problems of its own, not least an alarming legacy of bad loans from the credit boom that was deliberately unleashed to cushion the Chinese economy against the knock on effects of the global financial crisis. Chinese authorities have repeatedly made clear their intention to try and switch from an export-dependent model of growth, to a more balanced, consumer-led pattern. Even if that switch is managed smoothly, it will hit exporters of the commodities and investment goods, such as machine tools, for which the country has been so hungry in recent years. But there are growing fears of a &quot;hard landing&quot;, if this radical transition goes awry. Analysts at HSBC argue that a China crash, rather than the end of the Fed&apos;s QE programme, actually presents the greatest risk of a sudden and damaging reversal in global capital flows, from the emerging world back to the safe haven of developed countries.", "publicationDate": "2013-08-21T17:57:12Z", "tags": ["Global economy", "Currencies", "Economics", "Business", "India", "World news", "Financial crisis", "Global development"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/21/india-rupee-record-low-us-dollar", "title": "India's rupee hits another record low against US dollar", "sentences": ["Thailand Bangkok was the crucible of the Asian financial crisis that struck in 1997, as Thailand became the first country to call for help from the International Monetary Fund after a doomed (and costly) effort to defend its currency, the baht, against speculators.", "Bangkok&apos;s stock market saw a run-up of 50% between early 2011 and May; but even before investors&apos; &quot;taper tantrum&quot;, there had been doubts about the sustainability of its economic model, which has become increasingly reliant on rapid credit growth, with household debt rising to a worrying 80% of GDP."]}, {"article": "Two Iranian men have been convicted by a Thai court for their role in a bomb plot last year that officials believe was an attempt to assassinate Israeli diplomats in Bangkok. Saeid Moradi, 29, whose legs were blown off when a bomb he attempted to throw at police detonated at his feet, was sentenced to life in prison for carrying explosives as well as for attempted murder. Mohammad Kharzei, 43, was jailed for 15 years for possessing explosives. The men were detained after a cache of homemade explosives destroyed the roof of their house in an upscale neighbourhood in of the Thai capital on 14 February last year. Moradi attempted to hail a taxi after fleeing the building, but when the driver refused to stop, he threw a bomb at the vehicle and another at police, injuring himself and five other people. Kharzei fled to Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport, where he was arrested while trying to board a flight. The defendants maintained their innocence throughout their trial and insisted that they were unaware of the explosives in their home. Investigators said the DIY explosives found at their property \u2013 which had round, coin-like magnets on them \u2013 were similar to the &quot;sticky&quot; bombs that had been used against Israeli embassy targets in India and Georgia the day before the Bangkok explosion. Neither Moradi nor Kharzei were charged with terrorism or attempted murder, however, and Iran has staunchly denied any involvement in any of the attacks. The attempted bombings in Delhi, Tbilisi and Bangkok followed increasing tensions between Israel, Iran and the west over Tehran&apos;s nuclear weapons programme after nuclear scientist Majid Shahriari was killed in the Iranian capital by an explosive device stuck to the window of his car by the passenger of a passing motorcycle Two other people survived a similar attack a few miles away the same morning. Iran claimed it was the work of the Israeli intelligence agency the Mossad and later executed a so-called Israeli spy after he allegedly confessed to receiving training in Tel Aviv. The resulting attacks against Israeli targets in India, Georgia and Thailand were widely believed to be retaliatory in nature. A Guardian investigation scoured witness statements, police evidence and court documents, and found the bomb plots to be the work of a co-ordinated group of roughly 12 Iranians, with preparations involving reconnaissance missions, house and transport rentals and target surveillance over a period of at least 10 months. Who orchestrated the attacks remains unclear. Test runs seem to have been carried out as early as April 2011, when five Iranians implicated in the bombings travelled to Thailand and India for reconnaissance. One of them, Leila Rohani, 31, visited Thailand twice in 2012 and rented the Ekkamai house shared by Moradi and Kharzei. Rohani is still at large, having returned to Tehran via Kuala Lumpur. Another Iranian, Masoud Sedaghatzadeh, 31, believed to be the mastermind behind the international operation, met Moradi and Kharzei in the Thai beach town of Pattaya and was with them when the house in Bangkok exploded. A day later he fled to Malaysia. In is now detained in prison in Kuala Lumpur, appealing against an extradition order to Thailand over his alleged role in the plot. Moradi, a former factory worker from Tehran, said during his trial that he was carrying the explosives out of his house in order to dispose of them and that he was unaware of their similarity to the bombs used to target Israeli diplomats in Delhi and Tbilisi. Kharzei told the court that he is not a militant but had met Moradi in Tehran airport before they boarded the flight to Thailand in February last year, and had nothing to do with the explosions. Their lawyer, Kittipong Kiattanapoom, said he would ask them if they wanted to appeal against their sentence.", "publicationDate": "2013-08-22T10:17:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Iran", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/22/thai-court-convicts-iranians-bomb-plot", "title": "Iranians convicted over Bangkok bomb plot", "sentences": ["Two Iranian men have been convicted by a Thai court for their role in a bomb plot last year that officials believe was an attempt to assassinate Israeli diplomats in Bangkok.", "Kharzei fled to Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport, where he was arrested while trying to board a flight.", "Investigators said the DIY explosives found at their property \u2013 which had round, coin-like magnets on them \u2013 were similar to the &quot;sticky&quot; bombs that had been used against Israeli embassy targets in India and Georgia the day before the Bangkok explosion.", "The attempted bombings in Delhi, Tbilisi and Bangkok followed increasing tensions between Israel, Iran and the west over Tehran&apos;s nuclear weapons programme after nuclear scientist Majid Shahriari was killed in the Iranian capital by an explosive device stuck to the window of his car by the passenger of a passing motorcycle Two other people survived a similar attack a few miles away the same morning.", "Another Iranian, Masoud Sedaghatzadeh, 31, believed to be the mastermind behind the international operation, met Moradi and Kharzei in the Thai beach town of Pattaya and was with them when the house in Bangkok exploded."]}, {"article": "Kingly Court, off Carnaby Street, London W1 (020 3747 9820).

There are exceptions: the whole roast poulet de bresse at L&apos;Ami Louis in Paris, which is so expensive it won&apos;t so much empty your wallet as pillage it; the chicken at Tonkotsu, which makes every other deep-fried hen look like a waste of corn-fed biomass.

The free-range birds we are eating may get to romp about in lush fields; we get industrial vents to eat them under, and bare floorboards. Hidden beneath all of this is some reasonably solid cooking, though it never quite matches the greatness of the crisp chicken shards with which it begins. Whoever came up with the notion of serving slabs of seasoned, deep-fried chicken skin has a filthy mind. It&apos;s \u00a31.75 of glorious, salty artery blocker. Other starters have flowery 15-word descriptions but amount to dippers and wings. A Bangkok scotch egg sounds like something a\u00a0businessman in Thailand might pay to witness late at night. It&apos;s a fine scotch egg with a soft yolk, but without the fire or punch that the Thai reference implies. A\u00a0bruschetta of soft salty ricotta cheese, whipped through with peas and pea shoots and topped with a poached egg, is fresh and lush but unbalanced by a\u00a0pillow of cheese mix large enough for a child to rest their head upon. It&apos;s unfinishable. The brick chicken for \u00a312.95 is, I\u00a0suppose, the reason for being here: half a roast hen, &quot;steeped&quot; \u2013 oh do please stop \u2013 in lemon, thyme and garlic, with gravy. It&apos;s roast chicken with crisp skin and moist meat. It functions. And I do also own an Ikea shelving unit which has been holding up books for years. By the time we get to the perfectly serviceable roast chicken breast with pancetta and clams in more sticky-salty chicken gravy, we&apos;re getting quite bored of, y&apos;know, chicken. Thank God we ordered the chicken Caesar salad, without the chicken. The dessert menu is noticeable for not offering a souffl\u00e9, which would strike me as an easy win for an egg and chicken restaurant. It does have a passionfruit mousse tart with a very soggy biscuit base, and a much better Eton mess, because it seems to be the law right now that every menu must. Whyte &amp; Brown is not bad. It&apos;s just a little odd. The curious thing is that by attempting to stand out in\u00a0a\u00a0crowded market, it fails to make an\u00a0argument for itself.", "publicationDate": "2013-08-25T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Restaurants", "Restaurants", "Life and style", "Travel", "Chicken", "Eggs"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/25/whyte-and-brown-restaurant-review", "title": "Whyte & Brown: restaurant review", "sentences": ["'Sounds like something a businessman in Thailand might pay to witness late at night': Bangkok scotch egg.", "A Bangkok scotch egg sounds like something a\u00a0businessman in Thailand might pay to witness late at night."]}, {"article": "There was a moment \u2013 classic Jos\u00e9 Mourinho \u2013 when someone in the room asked whether it was true, after all the fluttering of eyelashes and full-on charm offensive, that he had wanted to manage Manchester United before Sir Alex Ferguson decided David Moyes was the better man for the job. Mourinho has always attempted to deny it. Now he tried to find another way of expressing himself and it came out in the form of song. Blue Day is the title, written by Suggs for the 1997 FA Cup final and still pumped around Stamford Bridge before Chelsea&apos;s home games. Mourinho offered only a few words but enough to make his point. &quot;Chelsea! Chelsea!&quot; He has always been a dab hand at deflecting awkward questions. Someone pointed out that a man of his achievement would have been an ideal fit for the &quot;biggest club in the world&quot; and he smiled at that description. &quot;Chelsea,&quot; he said, cutting off the question. Not United? &quot;Chelsea,&quot; he repeated. Mourinho, of course, could hardly be expected to lose face with a sudden confession. He did also admit recently there was a culture of mistruths in football club press conferences (&quot;we lie&quot;). There was a beauty earlier in the summer when he claimed never to have had a single disagreement with Roman Abramovich or Andriy Shevchenko. Just as intriguing was his assertion, repeated again this weekend, that Ferguson had confided in him &quot;many months ago&quot; that he was retiring. Or, to run through that one again, that Ferguson decided to pass the biggest secret of his professional life to the then Real Madrid manager before his family or anyone from Old Trafford. Let&apos;s maybe wait to see what Ferguson makes of that in his latest book. Alex Ferguson, My Autobiography comes out on 24 October. Two weeks before Mourinho on Football is published. Once again, we should probably expect a few claims and counter-claims, lots of positioning and some obligatory points-scoring. Both men speak of one another so glowingly these days it can feel like a trick of the mind that, in their last year as rival Premier League managers, Ferguson suggested Mourinho &quot;should button his lip&quot; at one stage. Mourinho, Ferguson said, had &quot;no respect for anyone but himself&quot;. The response was classic Mourinho: &quot;Alex is an intelligent man but the problem is he thinks other people are stupid. They are not and can only laugh.&quot; Ferguson, on one Champions League trip, effectively declared the relationship dead. Mourinho shrugged and smiled some more. Different rules now, of course. Mourinho&apos;s relationship with Moyes is probably best filed as &quot;one to watch&quot;. There was a brief spat in 2006 when Mourinho accused Andy Johnson of diving and Everton threatened to report Chelsea&apos;s manager to the Football Association. Yet Mourinho backed down on that one and Moyes sent him a letter wishing him good luck when he left Chelsea the following year. Beyond that, there isn&apos;t a great deal more in terms of history \u2013 quite possibly because Mourinho never had too much trouble against Everton. In eight games, Chelsea won five and drew three, pretty much in keeping with the rest of Moyes&apos;s general performance against the major clubs. The man Ferguson picked to replace him, despite an admirable record at Goodison and some impressive results, in particular against Manchester City, did not win a single game at Old Trafford, Stamford Bridge, Anfield or the Emirates in 44 attempts. How seriously Mourinho wanted the United job, or whether it actually matters now, is another point, and there are people at Chelsea who consider it irrelevant now he is winning matches again for their club. It does, however, offer some insight into the Mourinho-Moyes dynamic. Take the story Paddy Crerand tells about United&apos;s Champions League tie against Real Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u in February. Crerard, a member of United&apos;s 1968 European Cup-winning side and now a pundit on their in-house television station, was greeted with a bear-hug when he arrived at Mourinho&apos;s press conference. Mourinho told him he was an MUTV subscriber and watched Crerand&apos;s phone-in every Monday night. He also asked if he could go on for an exclusive interview (a promise he subsequently kept). Crerand, by his own admission, was bemused. &quot;We had never met before,&quot; the 74-year-old says. &quot;I was surprised he knew all about me.&quot; If Mourinho was aggrieved to be overlooked by Ferguson, he has never admitted it. Equally, it is not the biggest leap of logic to think someone with his ego would be put out, to say the least, when he puts his CV against the man Ferguson and United considered superior. Or that it is any surprise we are starting to see the first barbs aimed at Moyes. If anything, the only surprise is that we have had to wait until the second weekend of the season. At Mourinho&apos;s latest conference he was asked whether, after trying to lure Wayne Rooney to Chelsea, he expected a hostile reception from the Old Trafford crowd. &quot;Why?&quot; he replied, with that shocked expression and exaggerated innocence he does so well. &quot;They are against me? But I didn&apos;t say [to Rooney] you will be a second choice for me.&quot; A pause. &quot;And they are against me?&quot; Mourinho was just warming up. &quot;We are trying to get a player that a manager told: &apos;You will be a second option.&apos; We are not going for [Robin] van Persie! They don&apos;t have to be against me. If I say Ramires is a second option for me and he plays when Lampard is tired or injured, if someone comes here to get Ramires, nobody is upset.&quot; Sometimes with Mourinho it is best to ask him directly what he is getting at. Was he actually saying it was Moyes&apos;s fault Rooney wanted to leave? &quot;Of course,&quot; he replied. The headlines were written. It was a fairly transparent attempt to undermine Moyes. A distortion of real events, too, when everyone involved in the process knows Rooney&apos;s exit strategy pre-dates the arrival of the new manager. What happened was Moyes made a slightly naive remark during an interview on United&apos;s pre-season visit to Bangkok. &quot;Overall, my thought on Wayne is, if for any reasons we had an injury to Robin van Persie, we&apos;ll need him,&quot; he said. That quote, in isolation, looks pretty damning, whereas the rest of the interview made it clear that Rooney was still a key component of the team. The quote was picked out, the damage was done and the Rooney camp saw their chance. That was the point it was leaked that Rooney was &quot;angry and confused&quot;. Behind the scenes, Moyes&apos;s irritation is spread several different ways \u2013 with Chelsea, the player&apos;s agent, Paul Stretford, the headline-writers, maybe even a little with himself. He hasn&apos;t bitten, though. Even when Mourinho has apparently been trying to get inside Rooney&apos;s head, Moyes has never complained in the way he did at Everton when Manchester City were trying to sign Joleon Lescott. His strategy appears to be: don&apos;t get wound up, don&apos;t let it show if something has got under your skin. Moyes is a streetwise, experienced operator but you would fear for him if he started trying to take on Mourinho in the way Ferguson once did. The new United manager simply does not have the presence of his predecessor. Far better to keep schtum, let the compliments flow, and at Old Trafford on Monday the red wine, too. If there is one thing Mourinho hates, it is not getting a reaction. Mourinho was asked how he saw himself getting on with the man three months his junior. &quot;The difference is the routine of being friends, of being relaxed together, before the match and after the match, being together again and having a laugh,&quot; he said, bringing Ferguson back into it. &quot;With David, we don&apos;t have that kind of relationship. But we have a good relationship. We can start the kind of relationship I had with Sir Alex.&quot; There were compliments as well. Of course there were. Mourinho often decorates his best verbal swipes with kind words around the edges. He did the same in his first press conference back at Stamford Bridge in June, full of welcoming praise for Moyes, then following it up by questioning how a manager with no Champions League experience or trophy background would do in Europe&apos;s premier club competition. &quot;People can&apos;t expect him to be a fish in water,&quot; the man who has won the European Cup with Porto and Internazionale concluded. In the next sentence Mourinho remembered he had managed &quot;I think, 108 matches&quot; at that level. Moyes, one suspects, is going to need a thick skin.", "publicationDate": "2013-08-25T22:00:02Z", "tags": ["Jos\u00e9 Mourinho", "David Moyes", "Chelsea", "Manchester United", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/aug/25/jose-mourinho-david-moyes", "title": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho aims compliments and verbal swipes at David Moyes | Daniel Taylor", "sentences": ["What happened was Moyes made a slightly naive remark during an interview on United&apos;s pre-season visit to Bangkok."]}, {"article": "There is almost nothing I would rather do than sit around a restaurant table with people I like. It&apos;s always a thrill, every bit as fizzy as the contents of the chilled coupes we&apos;ve just been upsold. But it&apos;s not all bonhomie and bubbles: there are things that buzzkill as effectively as a sign that says &quot;prop: Gregg Wallace&quot;. Here are my worst culprits, the grit in the mussel of restaurant-going. Tipping and double tipping The bill has had its 12.5% duly levied, but the card machine starts hectoring you for more cash like a crusty with a dog on a string. There is a school of thought that says you should bung a tenner on top of service if you&apos;ve been properly schmoozed, but with a meal for two in London routinely costing well over a ton, I fret that if I do they&apos;ll think I haven&apos;t spotted the charge and undertipped. No matter how often I eat out, tipping remains a minefield. I like it when service isn&apos;t included: I sing hallelujah and tip properly. Alas, there are way too many who don&apos;t: when I worked in restaurants, people would sometimes furtively cache a 50p coin under their saucers. My tactic was to run after them bellowing: &quot;Excuse me, sir, you&apos;ve left your bus fare on the table.&quot; These days I pay the service charge, hope and pray it gets to the staff and scuttle off into the night, suffused with some vague sense of guilt and shame. No reservations Yes, I know all about the financial imperatives behind this, the necessity for businesses to keep the tills ringing in the face of recession. And I&apos;m aware that for some there&apos;s nothing sexier than a long, hot, hard queueing session. But it&apos;s not for me: the idea that I might not end up with a table at my chosen restaurant fills me with a nameless, black panic. I&apos;ve been known to sidle into the likes of Spuntino or Pitt Cue Co at unpopular hours, noon or 10.30 at night, but this is evidence of solitary vice rather than sociable interaction. Stop muttering &quot;get a life&quot; at the back there, and hashtagging #firstworldproblems. This is my life. Waiters who act like your best pal &quot;Hey guys, how you doin&apos;?&quot; beams our new best pal, as though he were Joey from the Lower East Side rather than Jeremy from Swindon. He hunkers, comfy-like. There is no evidence of an order pad or new techno thingie on which to commit our order. All of which makes me want to hurtle, screaming, straight to the nearest chippie. Nobody admires front-of-house practitioners more than I do, but when I&apos;m with my actual friends, I don&apos;t need a new, temporary one for the evening. I do not want to be called &quot;laydeez&quot; or be told that the pudding course is &quot;what you&apos;ve been waiting for&quot;. I really do not want to be led to the actual Ladies and have the door held open for me with a knowing grin. Once, in Babylon, Kensington (now owned by Richard Branson), the waiter ushered me into the Gents to show me a kind of peephole into the Ladies. While I&apos;m assured it&apos;s no longer there, there is such a thing as being overserved. Wineglass-filling fascism There are restaurants where they deliberately leave your wine at a remove from the table so you have no control over your booze intake. Just typing that sends a chill through my marrow: an empty glass during dinner dismays almost as much as begging to have it filled. But worse is one that&apos;s relentlessly topped up, a waiter or sommelier permanently at your elbow, destroying anecdotes and galumphing over confidences. To your horror, you discover that the bottle is magically empty and you&apos;ve only just finished your starters. You order another bottle, trying not to think about the already stratospheric bill. Top relaxing evening guaranteed. Restaurant websites These are almost universally awful: clubby music, &quot;clever&quot; flash animation (&quot;please wait while we load&quot; \u2026 Next!), the chef&apos;s &quot;philosophy&quot;, stock photography of random food and a lot of waffling about seasonal and local gleaned from watching Gordon&apos;s Kitchen Nightmares. Even worse are those designed for Continental Big Names whose idea of fun is making you chase the cursor around a tableau of dancing hams. All I is want is the menu with prices, maybe some nice photos of the interior, opening hours and contact details. How hard can it be? Almost impossible, apparently. A nice chat with the chef When I see the chef looming over to my table, I do not think, &quot;Goody \u2013 here&apos;s a chap who will love to hear my constructive overview of his cooking,&quot; and settle in for a nice t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate. Unless you&apos;re prepared to toe the party line of everything&apos;s-bloody-marvellous-you&apos;re-a-genius-how-do-you-do-it?, chefs are not interested in your feedback. Try telling them that the duck was overcooked, the chips tasted frozen and the asparagus wasn&apos;t local. Go on, I dare you. &apos;High concept&apos; An email arrives announcing a new &quot;free-range chicken and egg&quot; restaurant. Menu items include the Bangkok scotch egg made with minced thigh meat and Thai herbs. There&apos;s a risotto scotch egg too. I&apos;m not making this up. I long to try these dishes almost as much as I long to swallow my own tongue. Here are words to strike fear into any food-obsessed heart: &quot;Prezzo opens chicken, burgers and rib concept, Cleaver.&quot; That is like telling hardcore musos that the new act is a Bieber-Swift mashup with topnotes of Perry. Or how about Tanner &amp; Co in Bermondsey, which imagines we&apos;d like to eat our dinner in an environment designed to reference school gymnasiums? School gyms only make me think of sweat and despair, not all of it mine. These are &quot;concept&quot; restaurants, only ever the work of gym-conditioned Justin and almost-anorexic Amanda in the &quot;ideas room&quot; of a catering conglomerate; Apprentice candidates who have somehow escaped into the real world. People who love food and enjoy restaurants don&apos;t open &quot;concepts&quot;. Nor should we eat in them. Tasting menus of more than 12 courses I have never finished one of these things sober. By course nine or so, it&apos;s all gone blurry. Because, believe me, you need that Elysium muscat to help ram down the artichoke and foraged elderberry caramelised earth. These menus are all about the chef. For the diner, they&apos;re not about pleasure, they&apos;re about macho endurance \u2013 yes, even for the gals. It&apos;s wallet-flexing, every bit as subtle as driving up in a liveried Ferrari wearing head-to-toe Burberry check. Multiple-course aficionados consider themselves way superior to someone stuffing themselves with 97 hotdogs. But by the time you&apos;re nibbling course 11, even if it is eel-skin crackers with cherry-smoked backfat, it still amounts to eating as a competitive sport. &apos;That table is booked&apos; This is my very favourite. So I&apos;ve studied the hotshot new openings and booked at the first portentous &quot;booking lines now open&quot; tweet, pecking at my phone like a demented budgie. And still I&apos;m led to the worst table in the house, the one facing into a corner or squashed next to the lavs. As I point tentatively to an empty table in a part of the restaurant that doesn&apos;t scream &quot;Hahaha Siberia you loser&quot;, the reply comes: &quot;I&apos;m sorry, madam, that table is booked.&quot; It makes me shrieky. How is it booked, how? Who are these people so clued-up that they not only book before anyone even knows it&apos;s open, they can specify an actual table? Of course, the truth isn&apos;t &quot;that table is booked&quot;, but &quot;we&apos;re keeping it for someone better designed to exemplify the brand values of our new white-hot establishment, someone with tattoos, a beard and an artisan salami company. Or some hedge-funders.&apos;&quot; 77%* of restaurants outside major cities The menu riddled with &quot;jus&quot; and &quot;medley&quot; and &quot;symphony of&quot;; the crescent moon side dishes of mangetout and baby corn; the salad bristling with raw green pepper; those high-backed leather dining chairs you find in the back pages of Restaurant magazine; the staff who have no idea what they&apos;re serving. Yep, we&apos;re in the provinces. And before you rage and froth and call me all kinds of obnoxious scenester consumerist chimpanzee, I too live in Not London, where I routinely put up with crooked-pinkie culinary pretentions \u2013 tomatoes carved into roses, &quot;fennel and gnocchi salad&quot; (truly), crabmeat packed into a lovely plastic crabshell, or, if the chef has ambitions, a dome of smoke over something that once tasted of fish \u2013 because there is little alternative. And that&apos;s before I start to rant about &quot;food service&quot; companies that knock up that lovely boeuf bourguignon in faceless industrial estate kitchens. No, I don&apos;t mean you, you 23%* who are brilliant, who bake all your own bread and pay your staff properly.

But far from being the confectionery it is designed to resemble, yaba \u2013 which translates to &quot;crazy medicine&quot; \u2013 is a mix of methamphetamine, better known as crystal meth, and caffeine that can leave users awake for days. Long the drug of choice for adults in Thailand, yaba producers are now trying to sell it to children through Facebook, Thai authorities say. &quot;Yaba [producers] are trying to change their product to meet the demands [of] targeted groups,&quot; Dr Viroj Verachai, of the Princess Mother National Institute on Drug Abuse Treatment, recently told the English-language daily The Nation. &quot;These flavours help the users take the drug more easily, but it could severely affect their [central] nervous systems.&quot; Yaba tablets are small enough to fit into a straw and are generally swallowed, or crushed into powder and snorted, smoked or injected. As the drug has gained popularity over the years, so has its potency \u2013 increasing in its methamphetamine concentration from 20% to as much as 95% for yaba&apos;s more pure, crystalline form, &quot;ice&quot;. Verachai said that roughly 75% of those seeking treatment at drug rehabilitation centres in Thailand were yaba users, with the remainder seeking help for ice. Doctors warn that chronic use can lead to hallucinations, anxiety and psychosis. As individual yaba tablets are sold for up to only 200 baht (\u00a34) each, the drug is easily accessible and highly popular with various social classes in Thailand. It is said to help factory workers toil long hours and socialites party all night long. In May, a 41-year-old monk told police he took the drug to help him lose weight, while in July one of the stars of the popular teen series Hormones caused a scandal when photographs of her using yaba went viral. The drug is produced predominantly in the Golden Triangle, a remote, jungle-studded area where Thailand, Burma and Laos join and ethnic armed militias rule a trade estimated to be worth $8.5bn (\u00a35.5bn). Data from the UN&apos;s Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that about 1.4bn yaba tablets are produced there each year; a 2011 report stated yaba was the drug of choice in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Brunei, the Philippines, Japan and South Korea. Yaba has made its way to North Korea, where it is reported to be mass-produced in government factories to be sold in China then traded back from there and consumed by up to 50% of adults in northern areas, replacing conventional medicine. While the Golden Triangle has long been a centre for opium production and smuggling \u2013 it is the world&apos;s second-largest opium producer after Afghanistan \u2013 yaba production is now spiralling there as well. Made in isolated factories and labs that can be easily abandoned or dismantled, the drug is mainly created in the forested hills of Shan state in the Burmese corner of the triangle, where policing is minimal and labs difficult to find. Crackdowns have had varying success. A 2003 war on drugs by the then Thai prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, led to more than 2,500 people being killed in three months as police followed orders to act &quot;decisively and without mercy&quot; against suspected dealers. While popular, the campaign raised questions over just how sure police were that many of those killed were actually involved in the drug trade and by 2011, the authorities estimated that nearly one in 60 Thais was a methamphetamine user. Just one year later, the public health minister estimated that nearly 7,000 children aged seven to 17 had been rehabilitated for methamphetamine use within the first half of the year alone. A second crackdown took place between April and June last year, when a joint operation between China, Thailand, Burma and Laos called Mekong Safe seized almost 10 tonnes of drugs, and more than 2,500 suspects were arrested. But a year on, the trade is far from stemmed. Just last week, police seized 1m yaba tablets stashed in the roof of a pickup truck in Chiang Rai, while in May several people were arrested after 400,000 yaba pills, and 7kg of ice were seized in Bangkok. Porous borders and corrupt officials mean that the trade requires massive cross-participation from various governments, as well as various and government agencies. On a recent visit to That Phanom, in Thailand&apos;s Nakhon Phanom province bordering Laos, the naval commander of the regional Mekong river patrol unit, Captain Surasak Suwanakesa, told the Guardian that his force regularly intercepted illegal shipments of rosewood, cannabis, yaba and dogs destined for dogmeat in Vietnam and China on the 155 miles of river borders his unit patrolled. But bribes are so common, he added, &quot;you could make millions on this border if you wanted to&quot;. Pushing yaba Bangladesh is the latest country in Asia to report a surge in use of a methamphetamine pill known as yaba, with research suggesting that criminal syndicates in Burma are targeting users in the country. The number of methamphetamine pills seized by police each year grew from 36,000 in 2008 to nearly 2 million in 2012, according to Bangladesh&apos;s Department of Narcotics Control. Research by the Jane&apos;s Intelligence Review journal suggested that &quot;the trafficking organisation inside Myanmar [Burma] is deliberately providing a promotional rate for exports to Bangladesh&quot;. The surge is reflected in rehab centres in Dhaka. Tarun Kanti Gayen, a clinical psychologist and director of CREA (Centre for Rehabilitation of Drug Addiction), said that until around 2011 80% of clients were heroin addicts, but now yaba users account for up to 70% of the centre&apos;s clients. Gayen says it is &quot;drug peddlers or dealers who fuel the demand, they bring yaba and young people rush into it and they get hooked&quot;. Tarique, 24, is a client of CREA in Dhaka, and has been using the drug for 10 years. This is his second spell in rehab; said: &quot;Nowadays everybody is selling yaba, you can find it across the street.

The blurb states that &quot;he persists in defining himself as &apos;underground&apos;&quot;, even though he is well known in his country and the Pacific region in general. He has yet to make a name in France, but the Manila Vice exhibition currently in S\u00e8te in southern France, will certainly help. Here Lee occupies an entire wall of the vast international museum of lowbrow art (Mus\u00e9e International des Arts Modestes, or MIAM) established in 2000 by Herv\u00e9 Di Rosa and Pascal Saumade. The wall is black and Lee has covered it with white drooling dragons, giant snails, laughing vampires and owls on dead trees. The drawings are highly skilled yet simplistic, doubtless a reference to some of the sources of this nightmare bestiary: cartoons, horror film posters, graffiti and tattoos. Above this vast mural, Lee has hung a dozen or so paintings that date between 2005 and 2012.They are so high up that you have to twist your neck to see them or climb a metal staircase in this strange museum to get a better view. There it becomes clear that Lee does not have one specific painting style but varies effects and techniques, alternating between powerful representational and expressionistic extremes. Most of these paintings are remarkable, and one or two are quite outstanding. Some would not be out of place next to a Basquiat; others would stand up easily in the company of a Kirchner or a Dix. The first Filipino punk is the most visible revelation in the Manila Vice exhibition, but not the only one. This is the first time we have had an opportunity to explore Filipino art in France, and of the 23 Filipino artists whose works are on display, Lee is the oldest while the youngest were born in the 80s. They have studied in the Philippines but some also in the US: for instance, Armando Flores and Gerardo Tan. They have held exhibitions in Manila as well as in Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, Taipei and San Francisco. In other words, these artists are familiar with the international contemporary art scene, but rather than work in New York or Berlin, most of these artists prefer to stay in and around their hometown of Manila. The life of that megalopolis \u2013 its cultures and iconographic traditions, the blend of religions, and the social and economic situation, where ostentatious wealth is juxtaposed with extreme poverty \u2013 is omnipresent in these works. The way the works are hung triggers many allusions to pre- and post-colonial Philippines, with display cases of figurines of Christ and Christian saints, toys inspired by Hollywood movies and their spinoffs, and primitive statuettes of rice deities. In addition to utilitarian objects made using the same aesthetic principles, here are also lifesize statues, realistic down to the details of the clothing. They resemble those by Maurizio Cattelan but are created by artisans from the Baguio region, who carve them with chainsaws before sculpting the details, painting them in a range of bright colours and varnishing them. There is no transition between the various works. Scenes with a Christian inspiration are placed side-by-side with paintings of monsters and zombies, and the Lamentation of Christ may be reinterpreted in the style of a rather less Catholic Night of the Living Dead. That is how things are in the Philippines, a country of hybrid culture, which has assimilated its indigenous roots, the Spanish, and later the American colonists, in addition to the influence of its relations with Asia. The unity of the exhibition lies in the artists&apos; total lack of hierarchy or prohibitions concerning their country&apos;s stock of references. Dina Gadia and Katwo Puertollano have made use of low-grade and Disney films, while Maria Jeona Zoleta consumes vast quantities of TV series and tabloids. Jayson Oliveria&apos;s smoking-and-pissing King Kong is fairly explicit, and Pow Martinez does not go in for nuance in his bloody neo-primitive genre.     Manuel Ocampo \u2026 'His paintings fill the entire vast exhibition space, each one swarming with monsters and demons'    The works echo each other from one wall to the next, clashing and finally mutually explaining each other since they all lead to the same pictorial chaos of names and myths. Most of the invited artists are painters and flow effortlessly, and perhaps mockingly, between references to the history of art and art markets. Jayson Oliveria happily shifts from his pissing King Kong to a richly coloured Richer-type abstract, demonstrating that he is quite as much at ease with one style as the other. The predominance of paintings may be due to the show&apos;s curator, Manuel Ocampo, who is a painter himself, born in the Philippines in 1965. He trained in Los Angeles and now lives in Seville. Ocampo&apos;s reputation has been established for more than a decade, spanning the Venice Biennale, the Lyon Contemporary Art Biennale and Documenta IX in Kassel, Germany. A number of scandals certainly contributed to his fame, but he has kept in the background for the Manila Vice exhibition, with only a mural drawing at the entrance (but a fairly shocking one), and a small painting of a narcissistic fish. However, in an exhibition of his works in Montpellier&apos;s Carr\u00e9 Sainte-Anne, a former church, Ocampo is far less restrained. Baroque might best describe it. His paintings fill the entire vast exhibition space, each one swarming with monsters and demons, religious or cabalistic signs, symbols and historic quotations. His still-lifes abound with axes, empty bottles and branches. He often writes on his canvases (in French or English) and assembles such a large variety of pictorial pastiches that it is impossible to keep track of them. One might tire of this verbosity and overabundance if Ocampo&apos;s principal aim were to demonstrate that he is a virtuoso of such hybrid forms. But there is far more to his works than that. They convey a deep, genuine anguish and a rage against religion and globalisation. The two exhibitions, in S\u00e8te and in Montpellier, are inseparable because Ocampo has played a key role in the formation and recognition of Filipino art through his own work and, as in these exhibitions, by his actions. Manila Vice, is at the Mus\u00e9e International des Arts Modestes, S\u00e8te, until 22 September Manuel Ocampo is at the Carr\u00e9 Sainte-Anne, Montpellier, until 15 September \u2022 This article was published in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde", "publicationDate": "2013-09-03T13:00:54Z", "tags": ["Art and design", "Art", "Culture", "Philippines", "Asia Pacific", "France", "World news", "Europe"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/03/filipino-art-manila-vice-ocampo", "title": "Art from the Philippines showcases global influences anchored in Manila", "sentences": ["They have held exhibitions in Manila as well as in Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, Taipei and San Francisco."]}, {"article": "For the first time, most of the world&apos;s populations live in cities. Rapid growth in air travel means even more people will be visiting them in the future. So where does the world want to visit, do business, or live? Ipsos Mori has surveyed more than 18,000 people in 24 countries, to find out. The most striking finding from the Ipsos Top Cities research is that there are a handful of &quot;superbrand&quot; cities. New York is the clear leader, but London and Paris, in joint second place, do very well indeed, chosen by large numbers of people as places they want to go. But the world&apos;s public don&apos;t just think about America and Europe. The United Arab Emirates may be home to the tiniest fraction of the world&apos;s population, but punches far above its weight in terms of profile, as witnessed by Abu Dhabi&apos;s fourth place as somewhere to visit. Meanwhile, Sydney&apos;s claims to truly be a &quot;world city&quot; are confirmed. It&apos;s clear that the global public is quite discerning and knows the cities well enough to avoid having to make hasty generalisations. New York is the place to make money. Paris is the best place to spend it. But for us, the surprise star is Zurich, which beats all its rivals in being the place the world&apos;s public would most like to live. London receives a global vote of confidence. It is a genuine all-rounder, appearing in the top five for each question, an achievement only matched by New York. If we restrict our focus to the young, it is London, along with New York, which is the most popular place to live for under-35s all over the world. And when we look at the views of the 11 European countries, London is the continent&apos;s most important city. Together with positive signs for the UK economy generally and in the wake of London 2012, this is both a sign for celebration by Boris Johnson and a prompt: what now needs to be done to ensure London continues to punch above its weight? Will all the people who want to move to London be welcomed or even housed? Three hundred miles away from London, Paris will not be too downbeat. The capital of the world&apos;s most visited country is the clear winner as the world&apos;s favourite place to visit, whether respondents are from Argentina, Australia or Canada. But Paris falls down on its reputation as somewhere to do business, and this will surely worry French policy-makers as they debate what needs to happen to get France&apos;s economy moving more quickly. Just 7% see France as one of the world&apos;s top business locations. It is beaten by Washington, a city not normally associated with the commercial world, as well as Mexico City, Kuala Lumpur, Beijing and Shanghai. Rome is in a similar position, with just 2% seeing it as a business centre, only a tenth the number who rate it a top place to visit on holiday. At the other end of the spectrum are Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, which perform strongly as places for business, but are not seen as attractive places to live. There are also questions to be asked in those cities which, despite their status, size, history and other attributes, have a relatively low profile, at least when looked at on the world stage. Cities in this cohort include Madrid, Istanbul (fieldwork was conducted before this summer&apos;s protests) and Bangkok. President Putin may be disappointed to see Moscow ranked alongside Brussels, in 31st place \u2013 if he wants more tourists he has lots to do. Finally, there are the cities that are just not popular at all. Tel Aviv, Tehran and Karachi are anchored to the foot of the table, and barely trouble the scorer. Some will be surprised to see Budapest, Casablanca and Warsaw occupying the places just above them. What of the future? Well, this is the first survey Ipsos has conducted of this kind, and we look forward to tracking our cities&apos; progress, perhaps adding a few more (such as Dubai) to the field as well. One thing to watch will be the perspectives of different generations, and how they evolve. At the moment, there is a broad consensus between younger and older people on the best places for business and best to visit. But on the best place to live we have an entirely different pattern: for the world&apos;s 50- to 64-year-olds, it&apos;s Zurich, Sydney and Toronto which occupy the top three places. But among the under-35s, it&apos;s London, New York and Paris. Can London hold on to its top slot as this younger generation get older?

The three, who included the minister for women and child development, had initially insisted they were not &quot;enjoying&quot; the video so did not need to step down, while one said he was trying to turn the phone off at the time. Similarly implausible excuses abound.

Just hours after a Thai Airways jet skidded off a Bangkok runway last night, leading to the frantic evacuation of 288 passengers, workers painted over the plane&apos;s distinctive purple and gold logo with black paint. Concealing the logo may seem a somewhat futile move, considering the plane spent the morning resting in the grass next to the runway with evacuation slides hanging out, but it is thought to be a damage limitation move by the airline, hoping to protect its reputation just two weeks after 20 passengers were injured after another Thai Airways plane hit heavy turbulence near Hong Kong. Yet, in an area of protocol designed to manage one of our most feared occurrences, the airline is not the first to engage in one of the more bizarre examples of post-plane-crash etiquette \u2026 Why do airlines paint over the logo? Described by a Thai Airways official following yesterday&apos;s incident as the &quot;crisis communication rule&quot;, there have been several occasions in the past when airlines have rushed to paint over a plane&apos;s livery following a crash. Take the Alitalia crash in February this year, when the ATR-72 plane veered off the runway in Rome, injuring 16 people. Giancarlo Schisano, Alitalia&apos;s director of operations, described the scramble to black out the airline logo as a &quot;routine practice used all over the world&quot;. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, he said: &quot;Blocking out a carrier&apos;s livery is a normal way of protecting a company&apos;s reputation, and even more in this case, because it is not an Alitalia plane.&quot; Indeed, despite being originally coated in red, white and green , the plane was leased from a Romanian budget airline, Carpatair. No surprise then, that the only marking left on the plane by workmen was a small Romanian flag. What happens to the black box? Black boxes (which are actually bright orange with reflective strips) are officially known as flight data recorders. They are thought to have picked up the nickname due to the original 1939 design being a photographic based system, that recorded using a piece of film and required the inside of the box to be pitch black in the same way as a dark room. Black boxes are mandatory on any commercial or corporate jet; as well as collecting data, they record all crew conversations and sounds from the cockpit. Crucial to finding out the cause of an accident, the box can withstand a fire of 1,100C for up to an hour and is sometimes the only device to survive. To minimise the damage done to them, black boxes are always installed in the tail of the plane \u2013 which is usually the last section to impact. After a crash, investigators will race to find the box to analyse its contents for clues. What happens to the pilots? Unless vandalism or terrorism is suspected, the site of a plane crash is not considered to be a crime scene and should the pilots have survived, they are free to go to their hotel. However, air crash investigators will rigorously interview the crew and compare this with recordings on the black box. The human performance team will conduct interviews, toxicology tests, speak to family and friends of the crew and even assess the airline&apos;s corporate culture. Questions can include anything from what major personal life changes the pilots have experienced, to what the mood of the crew was before the flight.   What happens to your luggage?   Anyone who has had the pleasure of listening to the in-flight safety guidance will know that in the event of an emergency, one should not rush back to their seat in order to grab the Cointreau and Toblerone you picked up in duty free. This didn&apos;t stop traumatised passengers back in July, who calmly collected their luggage while exiting, as their Asiana Airlines Flight 214 burned on the runway of San Francisco airport. They might be forgiven if they knew the official process; airlines are usually unable to access luggage while the crash is still being investigated and usually end up just compensating passengers for the loss of belongings instead, in accordance with the standard contract of carriage. How are passengers compensated? Compared to other compensation claims, getting a payment after a plane crash is relatively straightforward. This is because it is not necessary for the person seeking damages to prove that any negligence has occurred. The Montreal Convention, which was adopted in 1999 by the International Civil Aviation Organisation and brought into UK law in 2002, sets out the terms of compensation for international flights and holds airlines under strict liability in the event of any injury to a passenger. However, despite this international treaty, passengers from different countries may still receive different payouts as they have the choice to seek compensation where they live, at their final destination, where the ticket was issued, where the air carrier is based, or the location where the air carrier mainly operates. Payouts for the death of a child in a plane crash in the US could be up to $10m, while past cases in South Korea have seen payouts closer to $500,000. What happens to the flight number? Despite three passengers losing their lives as a result of the Asiana Flight 214 crash, the plane continued to &quot;fly&quot; between Seoul and San Francisco for over a month before the airline officially retired the flight number this August, renaming it Flight 212. While, for obvious reasons, airlines usually do retire flight numbers after a crash, it is not a given and nor does it relate to the severity of the accident. For example, the US Airways Flight 1549, which was famously landed into the Hudson river, saving all passengers, is no longer in use, while the Delta Flight 723 which crashed in Boston in 1973 killing everyone on board is now back in use, albeit on a different route. Despite the numbers of the United Airlines flights involved in the 9/11 attacks being permanently retired, an apparent computer error led to them being reassigned in 2011 \u2013 much to the shock of prospective passengers. The union that represents United&apos;s flight attendants described this as a &quot;terrible misstep&quot;, while an airline spokesman said the glitch &quot;should not have happened&quot;.

It proclaims on its website that it is &quot;run on conservative principles and imperiously heedless of fashions and trend \u2026 untouched by pop culture and post-modern primitivism&quot;, which has also gained it a deserved reputation for eccentricity. The cheaper rooms can look a bit tired and are very simple, with fans, some period modernist furniture and en suites. The pricier &quot;suites&quot; come with a separate living room. Excellent location just off Sukhumvit Road, a &quot;no sex tourist&quot; door policy, fantastic Thai restaurant, library and a policy of only taking bookings by fax add to the enigma.\u00a0\u2022 +66 22526069/fax\u00a0+66 26568123, theatlantahotelbangkok.com, doubles from \u00a320 AS Cape House          Cape House, in the heart of one of Bangkok&apos;s most salubrious districts, close to the Chitlom Skytrain BTS station on Soi Lang Suan, is one of the Thai capital&apos;s best-run small serviced-apartment blocks. Like with most &quot;rooms&quot; in this sector of the market, what you actually get is a mini-apartment, with separate bedroom, kitchen, washing machine and dining area. Service is excellent, and the rooms are pleasantly decorated, with huge sofas, TVs, large bathtubs and Wi-Fi.

It&apos;s also a highly sought-after spot and can get booked months ahead in high season (November to February). The airy, arty wooden-shuttered rooms are as homely as a quirkily crafted doll&apos;s house while the beautiful rooftop views and garden cafe add to the relaxed atmosphere.

As for this golden teak house, it&apos;s a King Rama V-era (late-19th-century) charmer with a beige paint job, most of its original details intact, and nine snug, spotless rooms.

One room is inspired by the bird&apos;s nest (eclectic found furniture), another by old Thai movie houses (cinema seats, B-movie posters).

When it comes to climate change, cities are where the most exciting progress is being made,&quot; said Michael Bloomberg, mayor of New York, speaking by videolink to the City Climate Leadership Awards in London this month. He added pointedly that, &quot;mayors do not have the luxury of just talking about problems. They have to deliver results.&quot; Partly, this is a matter of necessity \u2013 more than half the world&apos;s people live in cities, they consume two-thirds of the world&apos;s energy and generate 70% of carbon emissions. &quot;If we want to win the war against climate change, it has to be won in cities,&quot; said Roland Busch, head of Cities and Infrastructure at Siemens, sponsors of the awards. Many of the world&apos;s megacities are situated on the coast and their vulnerability to sea level rise and the effects of extreme weather events has been highlighted in recent years by disasters such as Superstorm Sandy, which devastated New York last year and Hurricane Katrina, which had a similar effect on New Orleans. But it&apos;s not just rising seas \u2013 each city has its own challenges, from the wildfires that threatened Melbourne in 2009 to the floods that deluged Bangkok in 2011, severely disrupting the entire Thai economy, to the choking smog that afflicts Beijing, New Delhi and Los Angeles. But equally, the world&apos;s urban areas are where the opportunities lie \u2013 they generate more than 70% of global GDP and cities are growing faster than other parts of the economy. &quot;If you want to provide infrastructure for people in the most cost-efficient and effective way, you do it in cities,&quot; said Busch. Perhaps the fact that people in urban environments are &quot;squished together&quot; makes them more accepting of the need to take action, said Matthew Pencharz, an adviser on energy and environment to London&apos;s mayor Boris Johnson. While national politicians&apos; pronouncements can sometimes seem too vague for people to get to grips with, &quot;mayors have found a way to take action that is accountable to the population and brings them visible, tangible benefits that improve their quality of life.&quot; Mayors have a lot of the right power, argues Rohit Aggarwala, special adviser to the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and former director of planning and sustainability in New York. &quot;The politics align well and, in addition, many of the interest groups that are most opposed to climate action are simply not as prominent in cities.&quot; The consultants McKinsey argue in a new report entitled How to make a city great, &quot;that leaders who make important strides in improving their cities do three things really well: They achieve smart growth. They do more with less. And they win support for change.&quot;     Bogota transport Photograph: Alcadia Mayor de Bogota    These improvements do not need to cost a lot of money if they are imaginative enough \u2013 McKinsey reports that the former mayor of Bogot\u00e1, Antanas Mockus, &quot;famously hired 420 mimes to make fun of traffic violators: this entertaining public ridicule reduced traffic fatalities by more than 50%.&quot; Robert Doyle, Lord Mayor of Melbourne, explained how his city has a plan to double the number of trees in the city by planting an extra 30,000 saplings, which he said would cut temperatures in the centre by 4\u00b0C, as well as making the city more liveable and sustainable. Other initiatives are more complex and all-encompassing \u2013 Tokyo won the finance and economic development prize at the awards for introducing the world&apos;s first city-based carbon trading programme, which since its introduction in 2010 has cut the Japanese capital&apos;s emissions by 7m tonnes by focusing on emissions from buildings.     Sinagore transport Photograph: Land Transport Authority of Singapore    Meanwhile, Singapore&apos;s Intelligent Transport System, which incorporates a range of smart transportation technologies and allow the city state to enjoy one of the lowest congestion rates of a city its size anywhere in the world, was awarded the Intelligent Infrastructure Prize. The old days, when the various aspects of city life were tackled separately, are gone, according to Busch. &quot;A city is like a human organism \u2013 everything has to work together. A comprehensive view of infrastructure, disregarding silos, is the key to the future development of cities.&quot; And while every city is different, they can learn a lot from each other about what works best \u2013 and they are prepared to do so, in a way that national governments do not seem to be. That is why Boris Johnson, opening the awards, said that whoever won the awards, &quot;you can be sure that we in London will shamelessly nick your ideas&quot;. One of the lessons cities have learned is the importance of measuring their impacts. &quot;If you know where to start, then you know where to go,&quot; said Busch. One example of this is the decidedly chilly city of Oslo in Norway, which discovered that along with heating in the winter, cooling buildings in summer was a significant source of emissions. &quot;We were surprised,&quot; said mayor Stian Berger R\u00f8sland, &quot;but it enabled us to look at using seawater for both heating and cooling.&quot; By refusing to wait for action from national governments and international bodies, cities are leading the way in addressing the risks posed by climate change, said Bloomberg. &quot;Using innovative local approaches, cities are having an impact on climate change globally.&quot; This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Yuthapoom Martnok, 36, was indicted last year under Thailand&apos;s tough l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law, article 112 \u2013 the crime of violating majesty \u2013 and spent nearly a year behind bars without bail on national security grounds. The case sparked controversy in Thailand \u2013 where l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 charges are punishable by up to 15 years in prison \u2013 not only because the defamation allegedly happened behind closed doors at the family home the two brothers shared, but also because it involved one person&apos;s word against another&apos;s. Analysts called the case absurd and said it proved just how easy it was for the law to be abused. In the past, cases have revolved around defamation in the public domain, such as on the internet, in speeches or, in one case, over a translation of a banned biography of the king. This case was different. The defendant, Yuthapoom, claimed that he and his older brother Thanawat, 38, argued frequently and vehemently over subjects ranging from how to run the business they shared to national politics and their dogs. Some fights had turned into near-deadly brawls, with Yuthapoom once brandishing a knife at his brother and police being called to their house. Thanawat said he and his brother fought all the time and that Yuthapoom never listened. He moved out of the house just after the knife incident in 2009, and a month later filed an official l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 charge, claiming that Yuthapoom had made insulting comments about the king as they watched him on television, and that he later wrote offensive comments about him on a video CD. King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 85, is a much-loved figure in Thailand, and his portrait hangs in many homes and shops. The country&apos;s pro-monarchy laws are among the toughest in the world and punish those who &quot;defame, insult or threaten the king, the queen or the heir to the throne or regent&quot;. Critics claim the laws are used to silence dissent and healthy dialogue in an effort to maintain national security. The number of charges filed has jumped since the military coup in 2006 that ousted the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was widely criticised for attempting to undermine the monarchy, charges he denied. In an interview while he was still in prison, Yuthapoom said his brother had accused him in order to squeeze him out of their car-cleaning liquid business, and described the case as a &quot;family feud that has been blown way out of proportion&quot;. &quot;I can&apos;t believe my own brother would do this to me,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m still trying to grasp how it came to this.&quot; Yuthapoom&apos;s brother was the only person who claimed to have seen or heard the defendant make the comments, and other relatives including his mother testified that Yuthapoom would often light candles at home to commemorate the king&apos;s birthday. The mother said she had never heard or seen her son defame the crown. The judge at a Bangkok criminal court who read out the verdict on Friday cited lack of evidence and conflicting testimony from the sole accuser and said: &quot;The brothers fought bitterly in the past so it is possible that the law was used by one brother to get back at the other.&quot; After the verdict was read, Yuthapoom said justice had been served and added: &quot;I can now get on with living my life.&quot; David Streckfuss, an expert in l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 cases, said the acquittal was an &quot;encouraging sign&quot;. He said: &quot;It would have been worrying had the court decided to try the case because it would have set a precedent for a whole new level of invasion of privacy for things related to l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9.&quot; Yuthapoom&apos;s lawyer, Saouvalux Pongam, who worked on the case pro bono, said that in spite of the case&apos;s dismissal, &quot;the core problem of the 112 law remains&quot;. She added: &quot;Anyone can sue anyone [else] and police have to pursue the case. It&apos;s so easy to accuse anyone of this crime.&quot; Human rights groups along with the US, EU and UN have expressed concern over the way article 112 is used. In a recent letter to the UN human rights council, the Hong Kong-based Asian Legal Resource Centre called into question the routine denial of bail to those accused, the substandard medical care provided in prison and the secrecy with which the courts operated. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University, called the case an absurdity but said the result showed that the judiciary had at least &quot;set some parameters around this absurd law&quot;. &quot;This acquittal will just add to the pressure to [revise] article 112 so that it becomes more practical and siblings in the same family can&apos;t simply accuse each other like that,&quot; he said. &quot;[In the future perhaps] the accused can be granted bail and not spend one year of his life in jail.&quot; Relations between the two brothers are now understandably strained. &quot;There was no other way to talk sense into him,&quot; Thanawat said when asked why he had levelled the charge against his brother. &quot;He had to be taught a lesson.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-09-13T14:04:13Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/13/thai-brother-cleared-insulting-king", "title": "Thai man accused by brother of insulting king cleared after year in jail", "sentences": ["The judge at a Bangkok criminal court who read out the verdict on Friday cited lack of evidence and conflicting testimony from the sole accuser and said: &quot;The brothers fought bitterly in the past so it is possible that the law was used by one brother to get back at the other.&quot; After the verdict was read, Yuthapoom said justice had been served and added: &quot;I can now get on with living my life.&quot; David Streckfuss, an expert in l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 cases, said the acquittal was an &quot;encouraging sign&quot;."]}, {"article": "Where to stay For old town charm, check into canalside B&amp;B The Asadang (+66 8 5180 7100, B&amp;B from \u00a366); in Chinatown, Shanghai Mansion (+66 2221 2121, B&amp;B from \u00a350) has a courtyard dripping with coloured lanterns and nightly Thai jazz; while in hip Thong Lor, Salil Hotels (doubles from \u00a335) is handy for getting anywhere on Sukhumvit Road.

The reigning Wimbledon champion still wants to play in the ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena in Greenwich in November but that is unlikely. He has already wiped out his Asian schedule and his medium-term aim is to recover from treatment to be in shape for his annual winter training block in Miami during December. If his recovery goes to plan, he hopes to be fully fit for Melbourne. &quot;Next week Andy is set to undergo minor back surgery in an effort to clear up a long-standing back problem,&quot; a statement from Murray&apos;s team said on Thursday. &quot;He will definitely miss tournaments in Bangkok, Tokyo and Shanghai. The problem flared up during the Italian Open this year when Andy was forced to retire and he sought advice from a range of specialists. After recently playing on hard courts and clay Andy once again sought medical advice about solving the issue once and for all. The aim is to be fully fit for the new season.&quot; A Murray insider described his chances of playing in Greenwich as &quot;touch and go&quot;. Although the surgery will be &quot;non-invasive&quot;, according to a source, it would seem inadvisable to risk aggravating the injury. The Scot, who has been troubled with persistent back pain since the season-ending tournament final in 2011, decided in the past few days that stitch-and-mend treatment is proving detrimental, even though he has won the US Open and Wimbledon titles since. He said in a tweet on Thursday night that he would be &quot;back stronger&quot; and also wrote: &quot;Thanks so much for all the nice messages today... Will let everyone know how it goes.&quot; He was struck down midway through the Rome Open this summer and pulled out of the French Open, a wise choice given his storming performance at Wimbledon, where he beat the world No1, Novak Djokovic, in three sets in the final. However, Murray&apos;s form fell away a little after Wimbledon, in Montreal and Cincinnati, and he lost to a resurgent Stanislas Wawrinka in the quarter-finals at Flushing Meadows, where he had gone with high hopes of retaining the US Open title. Murray handled the physical pressure of leading Great Britain&apos;s Davis Cup tie against Croatia last weekend, winning both his singles and partnering Colin Fleming to take the doubles in a 4-1 triumph that put the team back in the elite world group for the first time since 2008. He later declared his commitment to remain in the squad for Great Britain&apos;s opening away match against the United States, straight after the Australian Open. It is clear that Murray and his coach Ivan Lendl look at the Melbourne tournament as the priority now. The option was to manage the injury with pain killers but it became increasingly obvious that strategy would have to be revised once his mobility in big matches made him vulnerable, most obvious in his loss to Wawrinka. The specialist physio Mark Bender accompanied him in New York, in the absence of the recently departed Andy Ireland, but he was not able to play with the fluency he showed earlier in the summer. It is thought the struggle of coming through three matches on the demanding clay of Umag last weekend convinced him he should seek a more radical and lasting solution. He was buoyed by the experience of lifting Great Britain back to the top of world team tennis, but the effort clearly took its toll. The nature of Murray&apos;s injury remains a minor mystery. He has refused in the past to confirm if it is disc-related, and, if it were, he might have to contemplate an extended absence from the game, much the same as Rafael Nadal did when he took seven months out to ease the long-term pain in his knees. It is thought Nadal&apos;s spectacular comeback, which he crowned with victory in the US Open final over Djokovic, convinced Murray to opt for a more drastic solution to his problem. There is no guarantee of surgical success with such an injury but Murray was tiring of the constant reliance on pain killers to get through tough matches. Although he has long insisted it is not a priority for him to reach the No1 world ranking, that quest will take a serious hit as he withdraws from key tournaments over the next two months. It is a brave call by Murray, but a judicious one. It is pointless playing on in pain that can only exacerbate the underlying complaint and, if he returns strong and fitter in January, he will be able to launch a more convincing assault on the major titles in 2014. He is still only 26 and has plenty of time to rebuild. Were he to carry on playing, he could only continue to store up trouble for the future. The increased physicality of the modern game has stretched all players to their limits and the new challenge for those in the top 10, who regularly go deeper in tournaments, is to managed those demands on their bodies.", "publicationDate": "2013-09-19T18:10:43Z", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Sport", "Australian Open", "Tennis", "Australia sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/19/andy-murray-surgery-back", "title": "Andy Murray to undergo minor surgery in bid to solve back problem", "sentences": ["&quot;He will definitely miss tournaments in Bangkok, Tokyo and Shanghai."]}, {"article": "Miyake, Portland Impeccable sushi is a really a thing of splendour, and it can take a lifetime, or longer, to master the preparation, even with access to the best-quality fish.

For his exploits during the second world war he was appointed OBE, and after it he led the abortive communist campaign to take over Malaya. Chin was the last of the major guerrilla commanders who fought colonialism in Asia after 1945, a group including Sukarno in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, Norodom Sihanouk in Cambodia and Aung San in Burma. When Malaya gained independence from Britain in 1957, and six years later merged into today&apos;s Malaysia, Chin continued his struggle for communist control of the new state from exile until a peace agreement was signed in 1989. At this point the Malaysian government flatly refused to allow him to return, a ban which has been extended to his remains. Chin Peng (his nom de guerre) is said to have been born in 1924 in the Malayan state of Perak. His birth name was Ong Boon Hua and his father was an immigrant from China who set up a bicycle business. He took to politics at the age of 13, joining a new ethnic-Chinese society set up to send aid to China in its fight against Japanese aggression. His first role was to lead anti-Japanese activity at his school. At 16 he became a communist. In 1939 he transferred from his Chinese-language school to a British Methodist one, but left after six months to escape British domination and become a full-time revolutionary. To evade local British authorities he moved to Kuala Lumpur, the Malayan capital, in July 1940. When he attained full membership of the Communist party a year later, he was already serving on a number of party committees in Perak as well as party labour organisations. The Japanese invaded Malaya in December 1941, when he was the junior member of the triumvirate running the Perak state committee. His two senior colleagues were arrested by the Japanese early in 1943, leaving Chin in charge. He went back to Kuala Lumpur in a bid to contact the CP central committee, which appointed a new state secretary for Perak in his place \u2013 but the new man was arrested as well, leaving Chin in charge at the age of 19. It was down to him to make contact with a British commando unit operating in Perak in September 1943. Japan was now the enemy and Chin adopted the view that my enemy&apos;s enemy is my friend; but the easy defeat of the British in Malaya, culminating in their worst-ever surrender in Singapore in February 1942, had convinced him that they could be driven out in their turn. For his dangerous work for British forces he was not only appointed OBE (later rescinded), but received two mentions in dispatches. When Lai Tek, secretary general of the Malayan CP, was unmasked as a double agent for the Japanese and the British, Chin was elected to replace him: he was the senior survivor of the party leadership after Lai had betrayed it to the Japanese. He was now 20. After the Japanese defeat in August 1945, the British colonial administration returned and Chin began plotting against it. A state of emergency was declared in June 1948 after the murders of three European planters, allegedly by Malayan CP members. Chin denied foreknowledge but the party was banned, and thousands of British servicemen fought his guerrillas in the jungle. Peace talks at Baling, near the border with Thailand, in the final days of 1955 foundered on the legal recognition of the Malayan CP and an amnesty for insurgents, and fighting continued. Uniquely, the harsh British counter-insurgency campaign prevailed and by 1960 Chin withdrew, first to Thailand and at the end of the year to Beijing. The subsequent &quot;confrontation&quot; by Indonesia against the new state and local British forces also failed and was abandoned in 1966. Urged on by the communist Chinese under Mao Zedong, Chin kept up the campaign against independent Malaya and then Malaysia, in which many thousands died. In 1970 and after, the guerrilla bases in Thailand succumbed to murderous factionalism and paranoia, with a succession of spy trials and executions over which the distant Chin in Beijing could not achieve control. The 1989 peace agreement included a provision for Chin and his comrades to return to his native country, which was never honoured. He went into exile in southern Thailand, travelling to Singapore to lecture at the university. His application in 2000 to return was rejected by the Malaysian high court after five years; his appeal failed in 2008, on the grounds that he was unable to prove his citizenship through documents long lost. Chin died in a Bangkok hospital on the 50th anniversary of the creation of Malaysia. His wife Khoon Wah predeceased him; they had two sons. \u2022 Chin Peng (Ong Boon Hua), political activist and guerrilla leader, born 21 October 1924; died 16 September 2013 \u2022 This obituary was amended on 30 September 2013.

Along with elephants and orang-utans, however, the loris is often peddled by touts as a photo opportunity for tourists.

A report by the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) claims many workers have been trafficked, held in bonded labour and subjected to abusive conditions. Thailand is the world&apos;s largest exporter of shrimp. It exports about 90% of its seafood, mainly to the US, Japan and EU countries. Once considered a delicacy, shrimp has become increasingly popular in the west. On average, every American consumed nearly 2kg of the crustacean in 2011; in the same year, Thailand was the UK&apos;s largest supplier of shrimp, with Britain snapping up an estimated $195m-worth. The executive director of EJF, Steve Trent, says the abuse of workers in the shrimp business is key to the industry&apos;s success. &quot;If you look at the economic model [in Thailand], this kind of labour abuse forms an inherent part of it \u2013 it&apos;s what drives down costs,&quot; says Trent. &quot;Everyone in Thailand knows this is going on, for them it&apos;s good business.&quot; &quot;We would ideally like to see Thailand take action against the bad guys, but if that&apos;s not going to happen, the European Union, as the world&apos;s largest seafood market, should introduce trade embargos. There is a reality here that we are eating products in the EU that have been produced by forced labour, on occasion slave labour, coming cheaply and easily from Thailand.&quot; The report bases its claims on evidence collected in two trips, in October 2012 and March 2013, focusing mainly on one fishing town, Mahachai in Samut Sakhon province, about 25 miles south-west of Bangkok. The port is a major part of the Thai shrimp infrastructure, supplying 31.5% of exports. One of the girls quoted in the report, Aung Aye, told investigators: &quot;I am 11 years old. I had to peel the shrimp shells and extract excrement. I hope that I will never be in such trouble again. I think peeling shrimp is the most difficult task I have ever done. I think [people in the west] eat shrimp because they don&apos;t know how it is produced at the factory. If they knew, they wouldn&apos;t eat it.&quot; The EJF investigated claims of human trafficking and labour abuses, with a particular focus on pre-processing facilities, known as peeling sheds. It claims that some of the country&apos;s largest exporting companies are using shrimp produced under &quot;exploitative, abusive and even violent conditions&quot;. The informal nature of the work, which is sub-contracted and highly labour intensive, means it is the least regulated aspect of the supply chain. Once peeled, the shrimp is passed to much larger processing facilities where it is prepared for export to the US, Japan and the EU, Thailand&apos;s main markets. Much of the alleged abuse is suffered by migrant workers who have to undertake arduous journeys to get to the shrimp factories. Workers from the neighbouring countries of Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia make up 90% of the workforce in the seafood processing industry, according to a 2010 Human Rights Watch report. One migrant reported: &quot;If we started work on the night shift at 4pm, we worked until 6-7am. As for the day shift, we have to wake up at 3am and start work at 4am. If there are lots of shrimps I have to work till 7-8 pm. Those who have debt bondage are not allowed to leave. Security is at the gate who stop them.&quot; Trade experts representing the EU do not believe that import bans are the answer to alleged mistreatment. John Clancy, the EU spokesperson for trade, says the EU is working with the Thai authorities to help fight child labour and human trafficking by monitoring and sponsoring development projects aimed at tackling abuse. But he stressed the importance of trade as a key tool for development. &quot;Our trade and development policy is based on the assumption that more and more sustainable trade can help boost economic growth, create jobs and eradicate poverty. &quot;Throughout history there is no country that has moved from a developing state to an emerging economy without trade. Trade is the driver of development.&quot; Trent, however, says responsibility lies not only with the Thai government but also with European officials and, eventually, the consumer. &quot;There isn&apos;t a reasonable person in the EU or UK who would happily eat a product that was fed with fish caught by a slave, peeled and prepared by people working for 14 hour days for less than you would earn in an hour, people with their rights denied, their documentation taken away. &quot;Relatively small increases in the price of this product could transform lives; this doesn&apos;t mean going from a \u00a32 bag to a \u00a310 bag, it&apos;s a difference of pennies.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-09-26T17:14:38Z", "tags": ["Global development", "Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "UK news", "US news", "European Union", "Europe"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/sep/26/thai-shrimp-forced-labour", "title": "Thai shrimp produced by forced labour reaching EU and US, warn campaigners", "sentences": ["There is a reality here that we are eating products in the EU that have been produced by forced labour, on occasion slave labour, coming cheaply and easily from Thailand.&quot; The report bases its claims on evidence collected in two trips, in October 2012 and March 2013, focusing mainly on one fishing town, Mahachai in Samut Sakhon province, about 25 miles south-west of Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Image one Harmandir Sahib, better known as the Golden Temple, in Amritsar, India, has entrances on all four sides, signifying the openness of Sikhdom towards all peoples and religions.Fancy a trip to India?

Hunched over his metal stall, between two hanging carcasses and an oversized tobacco pipe, the 42-year-old is surveying his killing station \u2013 an open-air concrete patio leading on to a busy road lined with industrial supply shops. Two skinless carcasses, glistening pure white in the hot morning sun, are being rinsed down by one of Nguyen&apos;s cousins. Just two steps away are holding pens containing five dogs each, all roughly the same size, some still sporting collars. Nguyen reaches into one cage and caresses the dog closest to the door. As it starts wagging its tail, he grabs a\u00a0heavy metal pipe, hits the dog across the head, then, laughing loudly, slams the cage door closed. Down the leafy streets of north Hanoi&apos;s Cau Giay district, not far from Nguyen&apos;s family business, sits one of the city&apos;s most famous restaurants, Quan Thit Cho Chieu Hoa, which has only one thing on the menu. There&apos;s dog stew, served warm in a soup of blood; barbecued dog with lemongrass and ginger; steamed dog with shrimp-paste sauce; dog entrails sliced thin like sausage; and skewered dog, marinated in chilli and coriander. This is just one of a\u00a0number of dogmeat restaurants in Cau Giay, but it is arguably the most revered, offering traditional dishes in a quiet setting along a canal. &quot;I know it seems weird for me to eat here when I have my own dogs at home and would never consider eating them,&quot; says Duc Cuong, a 29-year-old doctor, as he wraps a sliver of entrails in a basil leaf and takes a bite. &quot;But I don&apos;t mind eating other people&apos;s dogs.&quot; He swallows and clears his throat. &quot;Dog tastes good and it&apos;s good for you.&quot; No one knows exactly when the Vietnamese started eating dog, but its consumption \u2013 primarily in the north \u2013 underlines a long tradition. And it is increasingly popular: activists claim up to 5 million of the animals are now eaten every year. Dog is the go-to dish for drinking parties, family reunions and special occasions. It is said to increase a man&apos;s virility, warm the blood on cold winter nights and help provide medicinal cures, and is considered a widely available, protein-rich, healthy alternative to the pork, chicken and beef that the Vietnamese consume every day. Some diners believe the more an animal suffers before it dies, the tastier its meat, which may explain the brutal way dogs are killed in Vietnam \u2013 usually by being bludgeoned to death with a\u00a0heavy metal pipe (this can take 10 to 12 blows), having their throats slit, being stabbed in the chest with a large knife, or being burned alive. &quot;I&apos;ve got footage of dogs being force-fed when they get to Vietnam, a bit like foie gras,&quot; says John Dalley, a\u00a0lanky British retiree who heads the Thailand-based Soi Dog Foundation, which works to stop the dogmeat trade in south-east Asia. &quot;They shove a tube into their stomach and pump solid rice and water in them to increase their weight for sale.&quot; Nguyen has a simpler method for bumping profits: &quot;When we want to increase the weight, we just put a stone in the dog&apos;s mouth.&quot; He shrugs, before opening up his cage for another kill.\u00a0 The government estimates that there are 10 million dogs in Vietnam, where dogmeat is more expensive than pork and can be sold for up to \u00a330 a dish in high-end restaurants. Ever-increasing demand has forced suppliers to look beyond the villages where dogs have traditionally been farmed and out to towns and cities all over Vietnam. Dog-snatching \u2013 of strays and pets \u2013 is so common now that thieves are increasingly beaten, sometimes to death, by enraged citizens. Demand has also spread beyond the country, sparking a\u00a0multimillion-pound trade that sees 300,000 dogs packed every year into tight metal cages in Thailand, floated across the Mekong to Laos, then shuttled for hundreds of miles through porous jungle borders, without food or water, before being killed in Vietnamese slaughterhouses. This is a black-market industry, managed by an international mafia and facilitated by corrupt officials, so it is little wonder activists have struggled to curb it. &quot;At first it was just a handful of small traders wanting to make a small profit,&quot; says Roger Lohanan of the Bangkok-based Thai Animal Guardians Association, which has been investigating the dogmeat trade since 1995. &quot;But now this business has become a fundamental export. The trade is tax-free and the profit 300-500%, so everybody wants a piece of the cake.&quot; Tha Rae is a sleepy little town in Thailand&apos;s paddy-filled north-eastern state of Sakon Nakhon. But Butcher Village, as it is known, earned its name trading dogs 150 years ago, when a group of Vietnamese Catholics fled persecution at home. Today, locals say at least 5,000 people \u2013 one-third of the population \u2013 supplement their meagre farming incomes by snatching, selling or killing dogs for local and foreign consumption. It&apos;s a\u00a0profitable hobby that can fetch up to \u00a36 a mutt. Transporting dogs without proper vaccination papers is illegal in Thailand, as is smuggling them into Laos without customs and tax documents. Eating them is not illegal, but it is not popular with locals, most of whom strongly oppose it. Yet here in Tha Rae, roadside stalls close to the town&apos;s main government building proffer sesame-cured, maroon-coloured slabs of sinewy dogmeat at 300 baht (\u00a36) a kilo. Inside the large blue coolers that separate the stalls are the pale white carcasses of frozen dog parts: heads, torsos, haunches. &quot;People use the heads and legs in tom yum soup,&quot; explains a stallkeeper, nursing her baby, &quot;but you could make any kind of dish you want with it.&quot; Despite the large numbers of dogs they smuggle out of the country every year, only a\u00a0handful of people run the Thai operation, claims Edwin Wiek, cofounder of the Animal Activist Alliance, a Thai-based charity pushing to stop the trade. &quot;We know these people: we know where they live, we know their names, we even have photographs,&quot; says Wiek, whose alliance relies on full-time informants in Thailand and Laos. &quot;Some of the photographs show their cars \u2013 their numberplates could be easily traced \u2013 but they get away with it because they pay a lot of money [in bribes]. And as long as they keep paying, there will be people in the system who accept it and turn a blind eye.&quot; Activists claim that one such person is the mayor of Tha Rae, Saithong Lalun, who lives in a\u00a0newly built mansion with colonnaded balconies and is said to profit directly from the industry. While he declined to be interviewed, citing past media interviews as causing the &quot;suffering&quot; of his constituents, a disgruntled politician who works closely with him will speak on condition of anonymity. &quot;Of course the mayor knows the trade is going on: he&apos;s involved in it,&quot; he says. &quot;The police and governor of Sakon Nakhon also have the capacity to end the trade, but they haven&apos;t.&quot; Crackdowns have increased, however, thanks to a large network of informants working primarily with the Royal Thai Navy, which intercepted a\u00a0shipment of nearly 2,000 dogs in April and another 3,000 in May, as they were being stacked on to boats and shipped to Laos. Leading the busts was Captain Surasak Suwanakesa, 45, naval commander of the regional Mekong Riverine Patrol Unit, who oversees 253km of the Thai-Laos river border crossing. His desire is to end the dogmeat trade once and for all. &quot;It really is a point of shame for this country,&quot; he says, shaking his head. But Surasak, who has been in this post for only nine months, has much larger and more pressing illegal substances to contend with on his waterways, such as yaba (crystal meth), cannabis and rosewood. On his iPad, he runs through images of previous raids, in which naval officers pose in front of their &quot;bounty&quot;, then outlines a map to highlight the dog smugglers&apos; route. &quot;There are two major strategic crossings,&quot; he says. &quot;The dogs are collected from village households, or stolen, sold for 200 baht [\u00a34] each, then sent to Tha Rae. From there, the bigger dogs are sent to a northern district, Baan Pheng, to go to China, while the smaller ones go to Vietnam. Five minutes across the river and the price of the dogs can go up 10 times. That&apos;s why the incentive is so high.&quot; The naval team depends on tipoffs from locals to crack down on the trade, but arrests are few and far between, activists say, with most smugglers paying only small fines and going back into business within days. Those orchestrating the deals are never pursued, and the men truly at risk are those trying to stop the trade: in an industry that Wiek claims could earn the Thai mafia more than \u00a31.25m every year, people such as Surasak are costing the smugglers a big drop in profit. &quot;The commander before me had a price of 4m baht [\u00a380,000] on his\u00a0head. I don&apos;t know what mine is.&quot; He smiles. &quot;The thing is, they&apos;re the same people, in the same cars, who do this again and again. When I catch them, I get them on as many counts of the law as I\u00a0can: customs tax, vaccination and transportation permits, and so on. This is unusual. It hasn&apos;t been done before. Normally every relevant government office would get 1m baht [\u00a320,000, in bribes]. It&apos;s a good thing this job is only three years long: you can make millions on this border if you want to.&quot; The route the smugglers take to reach Vietnam is Highway 8, a two-lane ribbon of road that cuts through Laos&apos;s limestone mountain passes, past wooden shacks and the large, modern mansions of the wealthy elite. While still in Thailand, the dogs will have been crammed into poultry carriers or heavy metal cages, 12 to 15 dogs in each, six to eight cages per truck, every convoy worth around 160,000 baht (\u00a33,200). They are driven, at night, to the border, before being floated across the Mekong and loaded on to other trucks. Using informants, fake numberplates and GPS to ensure their routes are clear and their cargo protected, the smugglers face nothing but open road from here on. &quot;Once they hit Laos, there&apos;s no stopping them,&quot; one Thai informant says with a sigh. &quot;They&apos;re home free.&quot; The smugglers, if they stop for a break, generally do so in Lak Sao, the last city in Laos before the Vietnamese border. &quot;You hear the trucks before you see them,&quot; the locals joke, as the convoys stream along these dusty roads almost every night, the howls of their cargo echoing through the cool mountain air. Following the route by public bus, I spot a lone dog truck travelling with empty cages on its way back to the Thai border.     A dogmeat restaurant in Hanoi. Dog is the go-to dish in Vietnam for drinking parties, family reunions and special occasions. Photograph: Luke Duggleby    &quot;My friend&apos;s uncle helps load the dogs on to the trucks sometimes when he&apos;s not working in the rice field,&quot; says the student sitting next to me, who has just begun to describe the tradition of eating dogmeat in Laos when our bus stops in front of a\u00a0cafe. Inside, two policemen are bundling a dog into an empty rice sack, which they twist quickly, then tie shut with a rope. The bag shakes violently as the dog squirms, trying to get out. &quot;Maybe they&apos;re having a party tonight,&quot; the student says, as we watch the officers sit down at a table, light up cigarettes and go back to drinking coffee. The Vietnamese border crossing is a remote mountain post manned by officers who ask for dollars in exchange for a passport stamp. It would be easy to get anything through here, it seems: the road is full of logging trucks carrying what looks like protected rosewood, and the officials who aren&apos;t asleep are openly demanding bribes. The road continues down towards the central city of Vinh, past French colonial schools and new houses with fairytale turrets. The number of dog-laden trucks passing through is endless, says Zuong Nguyen, 38, a wild-eyed bus driver who makes the six-hour journey from Vinh to Hanoi every other night. &quot;Those trucks, they always have dogs, but lately I&apos;ve seen cats, too.&quot; In Hanoi, dog restaurants generally huddle together, with signs bearing a dog&apos;s head, or a\u00a0roasted dog&apos;s torso hanging from a large metal hook. Along Tam Trinh, a stretch of road south of the city, dozens of roadside stalls sell roasted dog to customers arriving by motorbike and on foot, with lines sometimes 10 deep. Teenagers in basketball shorts chop up the dogmeat with heavy butchers&apos; knives, sprinkling on a potent seasoning of curry powder, chilli, coriander, dill and shrimp paste, before skewering the meat to be barbecued. In the shop run by Hoa Mo \u2013 a 63-year-old woman who has spent her entire life selling dogmeat \u2013 a man is handed a plastic bag containing 12 dog paws. &quot;My wife just gave birth but she&apos;s having trouble lactating,&quot; he explains. &quot;There&apos;s an old recipe that calls for boiling the paws in a\u00a0soup; we&apos;ll use that to help get her going again.&quot; Each stall owner buys from suppliers who provide as many as 100 dogs a day, yet none of them knows where or how the dogs are sourced. Only one worker, Sy Le Vanh, a boyish 18-year-old slicing up carcasses at a family-run stall, says the dogs &quot;must be Vietnamese&quot;. &quot;I&apos;m pretty sure our supplier used to get dogs from Thailand and Laos,&quot; he says, &quot;but they were always so scrawny.&quot; Pet ownership is still relatively new in Vietnam \u2013 dogs here have traditionally been reared for either food or security purposes \u2013 so campaigners have chosen to scrap the &quot;cruelty&quot; argument in favour of emphasising dogmeat&apos;s effect on people&apos;s health. It has been linked to regional outbreaks of trichinosis, cholera and rabies, a point activists underscore as the region looks to eradicate rabies by 2020. At the first international meeting on the dogmeat trade in Hanoi in late August, lawmakers and campaigners from Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam agreed on a five-point plan, including a five-year moratorium on the cross-border transportation of\u00a0dogs for commercial purposes, in order to\u00a0research the impact on rabies transmission. The agreement might represent a significant policy shift, Dalley says, but may do little to wipe out the trade. &quot;Through undercover investigators, we know the smugglers are already looking at alternative measures, including slaughtering dogs in Thailand and shipping carcasses as opposed to live animals.&quot; His foundation will be employing a\u00a0full-time agent to monitor the border between Laos and Vietnam, he adds. &quot;There will\u00a0be a follow-up meeting in Bangkok, probably\u00a0in the new year, and it will be embarrassing if they are still allowing dogs in.&quot; Of the nations involved in the dogmeat trade, it is Thailand that is taking most action to curtail it. Once shipments are intercepted by Surasak&apos;s team, the dogs are sent to a government-run shelter in Nakhon Phanom, an hour north of the naval base, to be numbered, treated for infectious diseases such as parvo, distemper and pneumonia, and sent to one of the nation&apos;s four other shelters. Nearly 5,000 dogs, most rescued from the dogmeat trade, now live in these centres, according to Thailand&apos;s livestock department. Yet only a very small percentage will ever be rehomed, and around 30 dogs die every day from infection or disease. Alarmed by this high death rate, Dalley has been working with the Thai government to supplement the shelters&apos; supplies with injections of food, medicine and volunteer western vets. But the going is tough, in large part because these dogs will now end up being shuttled from cage to cage, waiting out the rest of their lives in a concrete pen, fighting for food, water and space. &quot;The majority of these dogs will never get adopted,&quot; Dalley says as we tour the shelter, overwhelmed by the barks, yelps, yowls and stench of 1,800 dogs crowded into cages separated by sex and medical status. We stop by the largest and healthiest pen, A, and a group of dogs rushes over, tails wagging. Some are still wearing their collars, underscoring theories that 90% are most likely pets. &quot;There are some beautiful dogs in there, but the Thais want the pedigree ones. A\u00a0couple of golden retrievers were recently adopted, but finding homes for 1,000-odd dogs that are basically Thai mutts is just not going to happen.&quot; It is impossible to imagine any of these animals as a potential food source, not because they are dogs, but because they are abysmally thin and desperately unhealthy. There are bony puppies with broken legs; mangy mutts oozing mucus from their eyes and noses; dogs covered in their own vomit and faeces; and the carcasses of those that have already died, in plastic bags, waiting to be buried. With only 12 staff and nearly 2,000 dogs to care for, survival here is a gamble, and as the shelter&apos;s Buddhist vets do not believe in &quot;playing God&quot;, staff might administer medicine to a dying dog for months on end, until finally it is no longer able to move. Many of those rescued from the dogmeat trade never even make it to Nakhon Phanom, Dalley says. &quot;Of 1,965 dogs intercepted in January 2012 from a\u00a0holding centre in Tha Rae and documented as being sent to [a shelter in] Buriram, 600 never arrived. We were told they&apos;d died or run away, but\u00a0they&apos;d been sold back into the trade.&quot; The navy&apos;s success in intercepting the traders has had the unintended effect of pushing the trade farther afield and underground, says Wiek, whose activist alliance has turned to alternative methods of surveillance \u2013 including drones and jetskis \u2013 the better to audit the business. &quot;In the past few years, since the navy and other units have started to arrest more and more dog traders, and carry out raids on slaughterhouses, the trade has spread like a cancer,&quot; he says. It now extends from Tha Rae all across the north-east of Thailand. Activists in Thailand are pushing for a new animal welfare law that would protect pets such as dogs and cats from being consumed or traded for consumption. But the law has little chance of making a real difference, Lohanan says. What may work instead is the opposite approach. Few in the Thai government openly oppose the trade, but one MP, Bhumiphat Phacharasap, has suggested that regulating dogmeat would stave off corruption and ensure that animals traded are fit for food. &quot;We could treat dogs the same way we treat cows and pigs, by ensuring they were free of disease, had been vaccinated and had export licences, and hadn&apos;t been tortured or harmed in transportation,&quot; he says. &quot;In Vietnam, they farm dogs just like they farm pigs and cows. I could accept that: you do it right, you eat it right. The problem is, we would be perceived as a culture that tortures animals because dogs are &apos;not for consumption&apos;. We would be criticised. We&apos;d be boycotted. We&apos;d lose our trade rights [with the rest of the world].&quot; His worry is legitimate, at least for a culture dealing with the west, where researchers stress the historical human-dog bond and point to dogs&apos; intelligence, using examples such as Chaser \u2013 a\u00a0border collie whose vocabulary includes more than 1,000 English words \u2013 to prove their mental capacities are comparable to those of two-year-old children. But apologists say it is hypocritical for a\u00a0culture that eats sheep, cows, pigs and chickens to draw the line at dogs. Pigs, for instance, do as well as primates in certain tests and are said by some scientists to be more advanced than dogs, yet many of us eat bacon without a second thought. This is circuitous reasoning, as Jonathan Safran Foer has argued in his book Eating Animals. He points to dogs as a plentiful and protein\u2011rich food source, and asks: &quot;Can&apos;t we get over our sentimentality?&quot; He continues: &quot;Unlike all farmed meat, which requires the creation and maintenance of animals, dogs are practically begging to be eaten. If we let dogs be dogs, and breed without interference, we would create a\u00a0sustainable, local meat supply with low energy inputs that would put even the most efficient grass-based farming to shame.&quot; His is an argument unlikely to win over many fans in the UK, the world&apos;s first country, in 1822, to make laws protecting animals from cruelty. It is a confounding issue, in part because it involves comparing cross-cultural mores with no clear answer. As the Australian philosopher Peter Singer put it in his 1975 work Animal Liberation: &quot;To protest about bullfighting in Spain, the eating of dogs in South Korea, or the slaughter of baby seals in Canada while continuing to eat eggs from hens who have spent their lives crammed into cages, or veal from calves who have been deprived of their mothers, their proper diet and the freedom to lie down with their legs extended, is like denouncing apartheid in South Africa while asking your neighbours not to sell their houses to blacks.&quot; Curious as to how this philosophy might play in Vietnam, I ask Duc Cuong, the doctor eating at the dogmeat restaurant, if it makes any difference to him that his meal could be someone&apos;s pet. &quot;No,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s not my pet, so I don&apos;t really care.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-09-27T17:00:00Z", "tags": ["Animal welfare", "Animals", "Dogs", "Pets", "Food & drink", "Meat", "Vietnamese food and drink", "Vietnam", "Thailand"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/27/eating-dog-vietnam-thailand-kate-hodal", "title": "How eating dog became big business in Vietnam", "sentences": ["&quot;At first it was just a handful of small traders wanting to make a small profit,&quot; says Roger Lohanan of the Bangkok-based Thai Animal Guardians Association, which has been investigating the dogmeat trade since 1995.", "&quot;There will\u00a0be a follow-up meeting in Bangkok, probably\u00a0in the new year, and it will be embarrassing if they are still allowing dogs in.&quot; Of the nations involved in the dogmeat trade, it is Thailand that is taking most action to curtail it."]}, {"article": "Best festival Trash was born at Cannes in 1999, when the idea struck me that the best way to cover this polymorphously perverse festival was through a diary. So it&apos;s probably in that environment that my column has thrived most. It coincided with the rise of the &quot;festival circuit&quot;, and I was fortunate to have the willing co-operation of the Observer and the festivals themselves in getting to cover so many of them. I still recall the jolt of a morning vodka with Alan Parker in Moscow where, because his Pink Floyd film The Wall was the most famous bootleg of the Soviet era, he is some kind of deity. Marrakech is a wonderful setting for a film festival and I shall cherish an afternoon with Martin Scorsese there, even though he spilt my mint tea as he crossed his little legs under one of those low tray tables. Bangkok briefly held a terrific festival, where I began a friendship with Olivier Assayas, although I mostly remember it for the food. San Sebasti\u00e1n has the best food, of course, and the biggest drinks, although I also saw some fabulous South American films there at the height of the continent&apos;s new wave (such as Bomb\u00f3n el Perro) and had my first interview with Woody Allen and the neurotic cast of Melinda and Melinda.     Martin Scorsese: 'He once spilt my mint tea.' Photograph: Paul Buck/EPA    The saddest festival has to be Edinburgh, which has ineluctably withered since moving outside the rest of the summer festivities there. It&apos;s also the worst walk, along that stinky road to the multiplex. Give me Venice&apos;s smelly canals. Although it too is &quot;at risk&quot; from the Toronto and Telluride festivals, I&apos;ve had some lovely times there and seen some memorable films (When the Levees Broke, Children of Men, Couscous). A moonlit swim in the Cipriani pool with Keira Knightley after the Atonement premiere; a bottle of champagne on the Excelsior beach with Samantha Morton and Laetita Casta; a dance with Spike Lee to Michael Jackson&apos;s Bad. At Shanghai there was a dinner with the late, lovely Anthony Minghella after we&apos;d spent an afternoon talking to students at a gigantic university, followed by my DJing at the Chinese premiere of Woody Allen&apos;s Match Point and getting Maggie Cheung, Andy Lau and Zhang Ziyi on the dancefloor. That&apos;s not to mention Taormina, Locarno, Dublin (I love Dublin) and our own brilliant LFF. But the winner will always be Cannes, where for 12 days \u2013 and nights \u2013 in May of every year this century, I have been at my happiest and Trashiest. Best party The lavish MTV Cannes parties at Pierre Cardin&apos;s bubble house are no longer. Gone are the private villas and the snows of yesteryear. Now there are more PR people than stars and journalists. They have us all by the balls. But the best things happen without pricey VIP rooms and clipboards. AmfAR&apos;s Cinema against Aids gala at Cannes is always spectacular. I went when it was at the Moulin in Mougins and Sharon Stone did the auction \u2013 a lady to whom you couldn&apos;t say no. But now it&apos;s at my favourite hotel in the world, the Hotel du Cap in Antibes. I danced with Chlo\u00eb Sevigny and Cameron Diaz there once, and then gave generously to charity. The Vanity Fair party at the Oscars is ridiculously fabulous, but I prefer the unruly old bashes from the early days of the Bifas, when Ray Winstone lead the way. His daughter, Jaime, upholds his legacy. It sometimes goes the other way too \u2013 one of the worst parties was when Vera Drake opened the LFF in 2004: amazing venue, great film, but such a downer that everyone walked around the Great Court in the British Museum in sepulchral silence. However, a key party that sticks in my mind was in 2002, when the Bafta awards ceremony first moved from a slow berth in April to become a vital part of the awards season. Suddenly I was at the Sanderson hotel with Nicole Kidman, Dustin Hoffman, Russell Crowe, Salma Hayek and Julia Roberts all milling around Harvey Weinstein. Madonna popped in later and Anna Friel fell over on the dancefloor. I remember the injection of glamour that it brought to a cold February, helping to re-establish London as the world destination for such things during the next decade. Best star Anna Friel and Samantha Morton were very good value at parties. Michael Fassbender&apos;s an impressive sight in full swing too, and a properly good bloke. Sally Hawkins is really, really funny. George Clooney is a giggle \u2013 he showed me how to tie a windsor knot \u2013 and Tilda Swinton is as passionate as she is hilarious and witty. Obviously at parties and dinners, and off the record, you get the best bits of a person. I was fortunate enough to host 350 episodes of the Film Weekly podcast for the Observer too, and had some wonderful guests giving amazing insights. Sometimes it was the least expected who were the richest voices. Ray Harryhausen was a delight; ditto Bruce Robinson recalling making Withnail and I, Terence Davies getting so excited he turned red, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd on his friend Lars von Trier&apos;s infamous Hitler gag, Sir Norman Foster at the top of the Gherkin and Werner Herzog discussing The Simpsons. My favourite male guests were David Thewlis, Vincent Cassel, John Sayles, Danny Boyle, Jacques Audiard and Denzel Washington. Of the women, it must be Lynne Ramsay, Naomie Harris, B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo, Mira Nair, Mila Kunis and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz.

Would like to thank\u2026 I have measured out my life in Trash. I met my wife on a one-night, 15-hour &quot;assignment&quot; in Ibiza, there and back to the premiere of It&apos;s All Gone Pete Tong; we had a La Dolce Vita-themed wedding (lucky I found a girl who didn&apos;t mind being up to her thighs in a fountain); I wrote of the birth of my first son Cy and his impending diet of black-and-white movies (how hopeful I was, before Dora the Explorer and Fireman Sam); my mother and grandmother have both made it into these pages. And to my dear cousin Amiee, with whom I stayed in LA while covering the Oscars and who was gutted she didn&apos;t get a mention next to Shirley Bassey in dispatches: hello Amiee! Thanks to the stars, directors, writers, execs and PRs who all gamely helped create and sustain 14 years of gossip on and off screen. Thanks to the editors, subs and lawyers who let me reveal the whispers from the other side of the red carpets and velvet ropes. My revels now are ended, at the Observer at least.

Though the Asian Development Bank referred to the concept around the turn of the century as &quot;growth that the poor and disadvantaged share in&quot;, it wasn&apos;t until the mid-noughties that it became common currency. In April 2004, as part of a wider drive to meet the millennium development goals, a joint committee of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) urged an acceleration in the rate of inclusive growth in poor countries. What they meant by that is hard to tell, however: nearly a decade on, the IMF still hasn&apos;t included a definition of inclusive growth in its online glossary, while the World Bank didn&apos;t offer an explanation of the term (pdf) until February 2009. That looks a trifle tardy when you consider that the broader evolution of the concept (pdf) has been linked with physiocracy, an economic theory dating back to the 18th century. Appearance: Indistinct, on account of extreme velocity; a towering, musclebound, green-and-gold blur. Known for striking lightning bolt poses. Are you describing Usain Bolt by any chance? Well spotted. Why so? Because, like Jamaica&apos;s six-time Olympic sprint champion, inclusive growth has a distinct character that&apos;s all about pace and pattern. And also because, as the jargon concept du jour, it leaves other development theories trailing in its wake.  Why, what&apos;s so special about inclusive growth? Well, for starters it&apos;s got its own dedicated policy centre. The UN Development Programme&apos;s International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth (IPC-IG), based in Brazil, is dedicated to helping policymakers devise strategies and programmes that will achieve high inclusive growth.  Wow. So presumably there&apos;s no problem defining the term, for a change? On the contrary, what inclusive growth entails is anyone&apos;s guess \u2013 although if the IPC-IG can&apos;t find out, no one can. Hang on, you mean there&apos;s an entire policy centre devoted to a development term that hasn&apos;t yet been properly defined? That&apos;s right. Although it&apos;s not so much that the term hasn&apos;t been defined, more that no two definitions seem to match (pdf). Some see inclusive growth as pro-poor growth \u2013 economic growth that benefits poor people \u2013 in another guise. The World Bank, however, makes the important distinction that while pro-poor growth focuses on the welfare of the poor, inclusive growth is &quot;concerned with opportunities for the majority of the labour force&quot; (pdf). And while some argue inclusive growth is about &quot;a growth pattern that includes all income strata&quot;, others believe it encompasses factors ranging beyond income, including participation in the growth process, living conditions and empowerment. Still, if the UN Development Programme has bothered to give inclusive growth its own policy centre, shouldn&apos;t they also have made more of an effort to, you know, find out what inclusive growth means? Believe me, their quest for enlightenment knows no bounds. They even convened a special two-day workshop at the five-star Claridges hotel in New Delhi \u2013 renowned for its &quot;swaying palm trees&quot; and &quot;seamless blend of old-world charm and [the] contemporary&quot; \u2013 just to &quot;conceptualise&quot; inclusive growth (pdf).  Really? Call me naive, but isn&apos;t a five-star hotel a slightly incongruous setting in which to discuss a development strategy? You&apos;re naive. It&apos;s not called &quot;inclusive&quot; growth for nothing; swanky venues are all part of the deal. In January, the IMF and Japan International Co-operation Agency hosted a conference on economic transformation and inclusive growth in frontier economies (pdf) at the deluxe Grand Hyatt Erawan in Bangkok, site of an award-winning spa offering &quot;a rejuvenating retreat from the rigours of urban living&quot;. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&apos;s spring workshop on inclusive growth (pdf) was held at the Ch\u00e2teau de la Muette, their plush headquarters on the edge of the Bois de Boulogne in Paris. And when the Clinton Global Initiative held a session entitled &quot;Myanmar: a frontier for inclusive growth&quot; at their annual meeting last month, it was to the Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel \u2013 which modestly proclaims itself &quot;one of the most iconic buildings in the Big Apple&quot; \u2013 that keynote speakers Tony Blair and Wunna Maung Lwin, the Myanmarese foreign minister, were summoned.  And there was I thinking inclusive growth was about tackling poverty and inequality. Not for nothing did Professor Stephan Klasen of the University of G\u00f6ttingen point out that inclusive growth is supposed to benefit &quot;all stripes of society, including the poor, the near-poor, middle-income groups, and even the rich&quot; (pdf). But you&apos;re right about the inequality bit. The final report of the high-level panel (pdf) on the post-2015 development agenda noted that the millennium development goals failed to address &quot;the need for inclusive growth to provide jobs&quot;, urging the international community to &quot;transform economies for jobs and inclusive growth&quot;. Notably, though, the panel did not propose a standalone goal on inequality. Why not? Were they a bit pressed for time? Given that they had enough time to hold meetings in New York, London, Monrovia and Bali \u2013 where the conference venue was described as &quot;more a palace than a hotel&quot; \u2013 probably not. A palace?!? When they talk about pattern and pace, do they mean a pattern of opulence and fast living? To rule out that possibility would run counter to the spirit of inclusiveness.  Do say: &quot;Inclusive growth is economic growth that results in a wider access to sustainable socioeconomic opportunities for a broader number of people, regions or countries, while protecting the vulnerable, all being done in an environment of fairness, equal justice, and political plurality&quot; (pdf). Don&apos;t say: &quot;I&apos;m feeling a bit left out, can someone please remind me what we&apos;re trying to do here?&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-10-03T13:45:00Z", "tags": ["Global development"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/oct/03/development-jargon-decoded-inclusive-growth", "title": "Development jargon decoded: inclusive growth | Les Roopanarine", "sentences": ["In January, the IMF and Japan International Co-operation Agency hosted a conference on economic transformation and inclusive growth in frontier economies (pdf) at the deluxe Grand Hyatt Erawan in Bangkok, site of an award-winning spa offering &quot;a rejuvenating retreat from the rigours of urban living&quot;."]}, {"article": "A political activist convicted of defaming the Thai monarchy was freed from prison after being granted a royal pardon in the same week that two others were jailed for similar offences despite their cases previously being dismissed by a criminal court. The recent sentences further highlight the &quot;unconditional taboo&quot; of speaking out against the Thai monarchy, human rights activists say, in a nation with some of the harshest lese-majesty laws in the world. Surachai Danwattananusorn, 71, a former communist insurgent who went on to lead a branch of the redshirt movement, was sentenced last year to 7.5 years imprisonment for remarks he made in three political speeches during redshirt protests in 2010. Almost 100 people were killed and more than 200 others injured during clashes with the Thai military. Surachai filed for a royal pardon last year and was expected to be released from a Bangkok prison within hours. His release follows the appeals court decision this week to overturn previous acquittals made by a lower court in two other lese-majesty cases. In one case a royalist yellowshirt leader was sentenced to two years&apos; imprisonment for repeating allegedly offensive remarks made by a political rival during a 2008 protest. Media mogul Sondhi Limthongkul, 65, was a senior figure in the pro-monarchy People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD) movement, whose mass protests in Bangkok helped trigger the 2006 coup that forced the then prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, out of office and led to an extended period of political upheaval. The yellowshirts went on to lead further protests in 2008 occupying the prime minister&apos;s office and Bangkok&apos;s two airports. It was during one of the 2008 rallies that Sondhi repeated allegedly &quot;anti-monarchy&quot; remarks made by a pro-Thaksin activist, Daranee Charnchoengsilpakul, known as Da Torpedo. Daranee was sentenced in 2011 to 15 years in jail for her comments, while Sondhi&apos;s case was initially thrown out on the grounds that the PAD leader was merely repeating her words to stress that she be prosecuted for those comments. On Tuesday, however, an appeals court overturned that dismissal on the grounds that, by repeating her comments in public, Sondhi was &quot;[making] those words known to an even wider audience&quot;. Sondhi was released after paying 500,000 baht (\u00a39,865) bail and is expected to appeal to the supreme court. On Wednesday, the appeals court overturned another previous dismissal, this one concerning online comments posted by a Thai woman to a web board in 2008. While a criminal court initially ruled that there was insufficient evidence to convict Noppawan Tangudomsuk of breaching Thailand&apos;s Computer Crimes Act, a judge ruled this week that an investigation had &quot;determined the computer&apos;s IP address and showed that the messages posted originated form the defendant&apos;s computer&quot;. Thailand&apos;s lese-majesty laws punish those found guilty of &quot;defaming, insulting or threatening the king, queen or heir to the throne or regent&quot;. Each offence carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in jail. Critics claim the laws are used to silence debate and dissent, with the number of charges filed having greatly increased since the 2006 military coup. Although King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 85, is considered a popular figure in Thailand, the law protecting the royal institution has been repeatedly condemned by human rights groups, pointing to the infrequency of bail being granted to those accused and the fact that anyone can bring a complaint against anyone else. Critics say a recent case in which a man accused his brother of anti-monarchy comments for reasons appearing to be nothing more than sibling rivalry shows that the laws are in urgent need of review. Lese-majesty expert David Streckfuss said that although many of the recent court verdicts were from cases launched under previous governments, there was no indication that the current administration \u2013 led by Thaksin&apos;s sister Yingluck Shinawatra \u2013 would review the laws. &quot;We cannot point the finger solely at Yingluck and her administration,&quot; Streckfuss said. &quot;On the other hand, sentences are not getting any lighter and Yingluck&apos;s government certainly hasn&apos;t tried to alter the public discourse on this topic.&quot; Sunai Phasuk of Human Rights Watch said the recent cases reaffirmed the &quot;unconditional taboo&quot; of making critical comments about Thailand&apos;s monarchy and added: &quot;There seems to be no limit to who can be targeted by lese-majeste laws and it doesn&apos;t matter which side of the political equation the person belongs to.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-10-03T15:09:04Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Law"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/thai-monarchy-lese-majesty-laws", "title": "Thai monarchy laws need reviewing, say critics pointing to recent cases", "sentences": ["Surachai filed for a royal pardon last year and was expected to be released from a Bangkok prison within hours.", "Media mogul Sondhi Limthongkul, 65, was a senior figure in the pro-monarchy People&apos;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD) movement, whose mass protests in Bangkok helped trigger the 2006 coup that forced the then prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, out of office and led to an extended period of political upheaval.", "The yellowshirts went on to lead further protests in 2008 occupying the prime minister&apos;s office and Bangkok&apos;s two airports."]}, {"article": "Many years ago, a friend of mine was queuing to see David Bowie when somebody sidled up alongside her and offered her \u00a31,000 for her ticket there and then. She later justified declining the offer by saying: &quot;What price genius?&quot; Well, it was only the Glass Spider tour \u2013 but hey, such steadfast devotion in the face of overwhelmingly inflated profit is to be admired. Those heading to Glastonbury this year will be looking at spending a figure in the same postcode. Two tickets for the event, which sold out in 87 minutes, would have set you back in excess of \u00a3400 \u2013 nearer \u00a3500 with the booking fee. Then there&apos;s the petrol, the extortionate price of beer you&apos;ll no doubt be drinking all day, festival food (which tastes a little bit like real food and costs twice as much), ponchos, wellies, the dubious tablets that never quite kicked in, bought from the wiry guy in a cricket hat \u2026 it all adds up.  The likelihood is you&apos;d easily spend a grand by going \u2013 and you don&apos;t even know who you&apos;ll see just yet. Yes, I&apos;m all too aware that Glastonbury is about more than just the music. Even so, there are plenty of adventures to be had out there that don&apos;t involve getting covered in excrement and seeing Keith Allen naked again. So what else might you do with that money on the last weekend of June? If horsepower is more your thing than cow power, you could spend the money driving around a speedway very loudly in a Ferrari or Lamborghini. Who wants to be in the audience for Dizzee Rascal or MIA when they could have an audience of their own, hammering the asphalt like James Hunt \u2013\u00a0or more likely that other James Hunt, Jeremy Clarkson. Six laps in a Ferrari F430 around the Atlanta Motor Speedway will set you back $599, which would still leave you enough change for flights, modest accommodation and chips and gravy when you got back. If you didn&apos;t get your hands on any of the 120,000 tickets, you could always invest the money you set aside, or even put it into a Ponzi scheme like Andrew Dice Clay&apos;s character in Blue Jasmine. The first option would be most prudent, allowing you to watch your wealth grow slowly throughout your lifetime and in the process adding some much needed excitement to your quotidian existence (provided you don&apos;t get knocked over by a bus). The second would awaken seething resentment in you, giving you something to moan about for the rest of eternity. Of course, given that the government is punishing savers in favour of housebuyers, you may as well piss it up against a tent. In the old days, before anybody even considered putting the words &quot;boutique&quot; and &quot;festival&quot; next to each other, music events like Glastonbury were the preserve of students and people who didn&apos;t have jobs. How about making like a student for real and InterRailing across Europe? It&apos;ll be like the old days all over again, as you argue about Simone de Beauvoir on the Rive Gauche before getting shot tearing up a picture of the Pope at the Vatican, your dying words: &quot;I just wanted to be like Sin\u00e9ad.&quot; You don&apos;t even have to be a student to do it: adult tickets will cost you \u00a3349 for 10 days of second class rail travel, or \u00a3550 for the same in first class, which is barely more than it would cost to travel first class from Paddington to Somerset. And if you travel first class, you can easily sleep on the trains and save money on hotels. You could even invest directly in the artists. Assuming that, with a bit of hunting around, you can find most albums for a fiver these days, you could buy CDs by 200 different artists and play them in different rooms of your home. That way you could recreate the Glastonbury sensation of never hearing a full set from anyone, and spend the day rushing between different stages (or rooms, if you insist on being literal). The big difference from the actual festival is that the distances will be a lot smaller, and you can visit a proper toilet on the way. If you are being more faithful to the experience, ask a dozen people in your street if they will host one of your &quot;stages&quot;. That way you get the experience of pushing past strangers to get to the front, and an insight into the lives of others to boot. Just don&apos;t stand outside their bedroom playing the ukelele after the CDs have finished. Finally, if you didn&apos;t get a ticket and the money is burning a hole in your pocket, you could always book flights to somewhere hot or take a boat trip.

The head coach, all suited and booted amid the red polyester training gear of his young Bahrain squad, watched as King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa entered the room, took his seat and delivered a few words of greeting to prompt polite chuckles of appreciation from the throng. &quot;Then he started shouting, again in Arabic, and I thought: &apos;Hold on, what&apos;s going on here then?&apos;&quot; recalls the \u00e9migr\u00e9. &quot;It had me worried for a second, in front of royalty wondering what was happening \u2026 Turns out he was screaming for the captain, our star player, to go up and sit next to him. I had a moment in that room. Everyone was bursting with pride. We&apos;d won the Under-23s Gulf Cup, the country&apos;s first trophy, and it was obvious how much it meant. I spoke to the king later and he knew all the stats for the tournament. That said it all.&quot; The celebratory reception, marking a 1-0 win over Saudi Arabia in the final, was back in September and, if the king had initially been fixated with Essa Ghaleb, it was the man who had masterminded the success who drew most admiring glances. Hudson is virtually an unknown in his homeland. His playing career in England amounted to little more than time at West Ham United&apos;s academy and in the lower leagues at Luton Town, the young midfielder forever struggling in his father&apos;s shadow. Alan Hudson played alongside Peter Osgood at Chelsea and was capped by his country. Anthony Hudson called short his playing career at 27 after spells with NEC Nijmegen and Wilmington Hammerheads in North Carolina. Yet, at 32, he is now a senior international manager and one of a few who can point to a major tournament victory on his CV. He was one of the youngest coaches to complete his Uefa pro and A licences. He has worked on the Tottenham Hotspur backroom staff, was described as a &quot;young Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&quot; by Harry Redknapp when departing to take up the reins at Newport County and has maintained his studies in the years since his spell at the Welsh club was prematurely curtailed. There has been time observing his idols first-hand, at Mourinho&apos;s Real Madrid and Marcelo Bielsa at Athletic Bilbao. Peter Taylor, then coaching the Bahrain seniors, brought him to the Gulf in March 2012, Hudson subsequently working under the Argentinian Gabriel Calder\u00f3n before, last month, taking charge of the first team setup himself. The immediate aim is to qualify for the 2015 Asia Games. The manager, though, has embarked on a journey that he is convinced will take him to Spain and South America, the Champions League and the World Cup. &quot;Ultimately, that&apos;s where I want to be competing,&quot; he says. &quot;There isn&apos;t a day that goes by without me watching games in Chile or Spain on my laptop and I&apos;m being drawn there. That&apos;s the style of football I love but I have to learn about it and the best way to do that is to go there and work under pressure. I need to know how they get their philosophy across. &quot;I&apos;m in no rush to go back to England. If I was working my way up through lower league football it would be harder to learn those different styles, or to find an environment where you are given the time to get a style across. I&apos;m not the finished product by any means, but if you really believe in something and you know your subject inside out \u2013 and I really do try and live it \u2013 it filters through to the people around you. I&apos;m passionate about the style of play I want my teams to adopt so, if you keep working, everything will take care of itself.&quot; He may still be young, but his education has been long-standing. Having roomed with Michael Carrick at West Ham \u2013 there are still email exchanges between the England midfielder, the Englishman abroad and their former team-mate and ex-Hull forward Richard Garcia \u2013 realisation dawned early that his own playing career would be limited. &quot;I carried the weight of my dad&apos;s name on my shoulders and I let it affect me,&quot; he says. The pair are not close. &quot;I&apos;ve never used his name to open doors and, when I realised I wasn&apos;t going to make it as a player, I fell in love with coaching. I knew I had a chance. I had time on my side and am completely open to hard work. If you haven&apos;t made a name for yourself as a player you have to bring something different to the table. That&apos;s what I&apos;ve been searching for.&quot; Something has clicked. The groundwork was done in two successful years with Real Maryland Monarchs in the United States. He learned Spanish \u2013 he is currently teaching himself French \u2013 and was a stand-out on his pro licence class. The grounding continued at Spurs and Newport, the requests fired off to spend time as an observer at elite clubs. He has visited 24 top-flight teams to gain experience, though it was his time with Bielsa in Bilbao and Mourinho in Madrid that proved most enlightening. &quot;Bielsa opened my eyes to a way of coaching I&apos;d never experienced before. I&apos;d always been so intrigued by how hard his teams work, whether it was Chile or Bilbao. I&apos;d heard the stories about what a great motivator he was but it&apos;s time on the training pitch that instils that work ethic in his players. They feel accountable. &quot;Players understand very clearly, in black and white, what they need to be doing when and where on the pitch. They buy into it because they know that if they run 50 yards to put a man under pressure, they will win back the ball. Watch how hard his teams work off the ball. Nothing they do is by coincidence. That&apos;s harder in the Gulf because of the temperature and the mentality in terms of work ethic is different to, say, a European team. But they still want the ball and, if they see that pressing high up the pitch wins it back, they&apos;ll buy into it. &quot;I visited Mourinho just after he&apos;d dropped [Iker] Casillas and he was under proper pressure. And yet the way he carried himself suggested it wasn&apos;t getting to him in the slightest and the aura of confidence he carried must have permeated through to his players. Mourinho is a winner. He can play lots of different ways, but ultimately he just wants to win. With Bielsa, it&apos;s almost the style and the way of playing that&apos;s as important, if not more so, than the winning. I admire them both. &quot;You have to stand for something. I would hate to be a coach that plays off the cuff, or just tells his team: &apos;Go and play.&apos; It scares me to think you could end up with a team that has no identity and plays horrible football. My whole life has been about trying to find a way to win with a certain style.&quot; The DVD of Bayern Munich&apos;s riotous performance at Manchester City last week has already been scrutinised and has travelled with Hudson to Thailand, where his team play a friendly on Thursday before next week&apos;s Asia Cup qualifier against Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur. The next stage is to transpose the minutiae gleaned from the footage into training sessions in Bangkok. The standard is improving in the Gulf with Qatar 2022 on the horizon. Working in Bahrain has offered Hudson an insight into what awaits at that tournament, whether it is played in summer or winter. &quot;The heat is unbearable, but you get by. You find ways. We train in the evening, adjusting game times, and they find ways.&quot; More troubling for family and friends back home was the wave of violence that erupted during pro-democracy protests in the wake of the Arab Spring two years ago, an issue highlighted in the sporting world by the controversy over the staging of Formula One Grand Prix on the island kingdom. Yet the national coach feels cut off from the disquiet. &quot;It&apos;ll be hard for people to believe this, but since I&apos;ve been here I&apos;ve not seen any problems. Where I live is very peaceful. But I&apos;ll freely admit my life is immersed in football, a very one-track existence. I&apos;m in a bubble which means I don&apos;t see much outside of football.&quot; At home in Amwaj, to the north of Manama, it is just Hudson and his Rhodesian ridgeback, Dyer, who tends to lounge on the balcony as his master pours over coverage of games from around the globe, firing off emails to his coaching staff through the night with ideas for drills. The under-23s&apos; general manager, Omran Abdulla, has nicknamed him &quot;Headache&quot;, having woken too often to lists of chores. Hudson&apos;s diligence is admired in Bahrain, his enthusiasm rubbing off and players and backroom staff alike. He may still be a student of the game but he has already bucked a trend \u2013 English coaches are not supposed to export well \u2013 and is making a name for himself.

Nearly 2,650 children a year die this way, and it was on learning of these statistics that staff at our school, the Triam Suksa school in Soi Dao on the Thai-Cambodian border, decided things had to change. The Triam school works towards inclusive education, which is not the norm in Thailand. It&apos;s in a rural location in the far east of the country, surrounded by the mountains and fruit farms in Phu Soi Dao national park. The nearby villages are a far cry from Thailand&apos;s tourist areas; pupils&apos; families so far this year have had to deal with flash flooding, malaria and dengue fever. I settled here five years ago with my family, when the credit crunch kicked in, and have never looked back. I started to teach and help out at the school because they opened their arms to my eldest son, who is eight and has ADHD. Some of the children come from disadvantaged backgrounds and some have special learning needs. For them, we&apos;ve opted to create a portable swimming pool and water safety programme to encourage awareness of the grave problem of youth drowning. It will consist of a 12m x 6.5m portable pool, with built-in sun protection. (With temperatures in the high 90s fahrenheit and above, this is a definite requirement.) The whole thing will cost around US$10,000 and it&apos;ll be completed in January this year, after which the safety programme can begin in earnest.     Teaching water safety. Photograph: Andrew Stenning    We already have our own swimming club: the Swimsafe Sharks, which has 450 child members between the ages of five and 11. Right now, it&apos;s a case of asking the Thai teachers to give lessons in the classroom on water safety, while we wait for the pool to be finished. Jack, one of our teachers here, recently finished his degree in sport education in Bangkok and is particularly interested in helping see the project through. &quot;Swimming is a lifelong lifesaving skill and more needs doing to get it taught in schools in Thailand and south-east Asia,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;ve known many people throughout my life who have died as a result of drowning \u2013 not just kids but adults too \u2013 because there are not the facilities to teach swimming in Thai schools.&quot; When construction is finished and the programme is up and running, we want to raise funding not just for our own water-safety education project, but also for the Global Drowning Fund \u2013 an Australian charity devoted to combating Asia&apos;s drowning epidemic. Our aim is to get this type of project into other rural Thai schools. The Triam Suksa portable swimming pool project is only possible through assistance from the private sector \u2013 in particular the Bangkok Charity Orchestra, whose recent concert at the Intercontinental Hotel in Bangkok raised US$8,000. We are also supported by Bangkok Movers &amp; Shakers, an organisation that holds corporate networking events to raise money for Thai children&apos;s charities, which has already supplied our school with a playground. This is our opportunity to grow and share. We as a school have been given this opening, and we want to give in turn to other schools and education bodies in Thailand, and to shed some light on this huge \u2013 but not new \u2013 problem of child fatalities through drowning.

In fact toilet-themed restaurants are nothing new \u2013 Taiwans&apos; Modern Toilet where chocolate ice-cream is served in toilet-shaped dishes is well-documented. Inspired by its success Magic Restroom owner YoYo Li has introduced toilets as seats and a mix of Asian and western food \u2013 like zha jiang mian, named &quot;constipation&quot; on the menu, braised pork over rice, (&quot;smells-like-poop&quot;), and sundaes (choose from chocolate &quot;black poop&quot; or the vanilla-strawberry sundae &quot;bloody number two&quot;) served, of course, in miniature toilet bowls. Revolting and distrubing in equal measure. Freud would have a field day. Isabel Choat  Twin Stars Diner, Moscow     Photograph: Reuters TV / Reuters/Reuters    It&apos;s hard to stand out in a city that loves extreme dining, whether it involves vines and amphorae, (Tiflis, the Russian word for the Georgian capital, Tbilisi), moving trams (Annushka), live goats (Shinok), or waterfalls (Blue Elephant) \u2013 but Alexei Khodorkovsky has managed to find a new niche, with the opening of his twin-themed restaurant. At the Twin Stars diner in Moscow, all the staff \u2013 from waiters to bartenders and even the chefs \u2013 are identically-dressed twins. The creepy concept is inspired by a 1964 Soviet film in which a girl winds up in an alternate reality and confronts her twin. Khodorkovsky says it&apos;s been hard to find suitably qualifed twins but the concept is paying off - the 24-hour restaurant is a hit with locals who don&apos;t seem bothered about the issue of whether or not to tip twice.  If Twin Stars represents the new Russia with its modern, funky design, the Expedicia is more traditional Russia - appealing, one imagines, to chest-beating Putin types with a love of the outdoors. In the pricey, survival-themed Expeditsia (&quot;expedition&quot;) restaurant you eat between an orange helicopter parked in the pine trees and a stuffed polar bear scratching itself by a stream. Guests can sprawl on the roof garden lawn or be beaten with birch twigs in the Siberian banya. Ingredients such as wild duck, fresh berries and mountain honey are flown in from the far north and east of Russia, and delicacies include elk in aspic, smoked venison, sea urchin and sturgeon, served with vodka, sea buckthorn juice or Baikal mineral water. Expect to pay around 1,500 roubles (\u00a330) for a main course; a shot of vodka will set you back around \u00a35 and a fresh juice \u00a39. \u2022 expedicia.ruPhoebe Taplin and Isabel Choat Carton King, Taichung City, Taiwan Taiwan has a penchant for themed absurdity when it comes to eating out. Whether for Japanese assassins lurking in the rafters at Ninja or the drinks served in specimen bottles to wash down one&apos;s turd-shaped bread at the aforementioned Modern Toilet, the food is rarely the primary draw. And so it is with Carton King, a restaurant whose owner was so depressed by the preponderance of plastic in modern life he built an eatery which, instead, promotes the virtues of corrugated cardboard. From the chairs to the plates and even the walls \u2013 the whole place is bedecked in the brown stuff. The food, although not fine dining, was more than edible and all that remained of our stewed pork ribs and herb-roasted chicken was the odd greasy smear on our cardboard table.

So the only surprise about Taipei&apos;s Barbie restaurant is that it took so long for someone to come up with the idea. It is staffed by waitresses in bright pink tops, tutus and tiaras, while the chairs are dressed in tutus and there&apos;s enough pink food to sink a Barbie cruise ship.

Bangkok&apos;s Royal Dragon is monumental. The colossal seafood place sprawls across 8.35 acres, has 1,000 staff, and requires 540 costumed waiters on roller skates to serve some 5,000 customers. And while it boasts the largest collection of live seafood tanks and 1,000 pan-Asian dishes, diners don&apos;t come for the food. It&apos;s all about the spectacle: traditional Thai and Chinese music, dance and martial arts shows, and waiters walking on water and &quot;flying&quot; through the air on zip-wires. Watch what you order if you choose live seafood (it is priced by weight and can be expensive), so there are no surprises \u2013 other than the waiters falling from the sky, that is. The dim sum buffet and set menus are the best value. Service can be slow despite the wheels and wires, making the experience best done with a group of (well-lubricated) friends.royal-dragon.comLara Dunston The Heart Attack Grill, Las Vegas, US     Photograph: Alamy    We all know Americans love big portions.

Diners are given hospital style gowns before tucking into the likes of a quadruple bypass burger, a towering heart attack on a plate made with four beef patties and 20 slices of bacon, served by waitresses dressed as nurses who will help you out of the restaurant in a wheel chair if necessary.

And this is only one of Onkel Taa&apos;s passions: the decor of the cosy wood-panelled osteria is filled with his weird and wonderful collections \u2013 everything from corkscrews to snail shaped fossils; and a whole museum is dedicated to the Habsurg Empire and Emperor Franz Josef in particular, whom, coincidentally, the chef closely resembles.

The US firm says the green-and-white &quot;Starbung&quot; emblem used by 43-year-old Damrong Maslae \u2013 which features a man in a skullcap pouring coffee and holding up a victory sign \u2013 infringes on its intellectual property rights. It is suing Maslae and his brother Damras, with whom he operates the stall, for 300,000 baht (\u00a36,000). Starbucks filed a cease-and-desist letter late last year and called for the brothers to stop using the logo. The company has since filed a trademark violation complaint, and last week it filed a petition with the international trade and central intellectual property court and called for the arrest of the brothers. In addition to the 300,000 baht payout, Starbucks is also demanding 7.5% annual interest and monthly instalments of 30,000 baht until the pair abandon their Starbung insignia. It says the likeness of the two logos could make customers believe they were buying Starbucks coffee when in fact it was from Starbung. Maslae, a father of six who has been serving coffee for 15 years, told the Guardian that his logo was created by a design-savvy friend and inspired not by the US firm but by Maslae&apos;s religion, Islam. &quot;My logo is halal and has a moon and a star, and is green for the colour of Islam,&quot; said Maslae, better known by customers as Bung. &quot;Starbucks has insisted I take out the green and the words star and coffee. I can&apos;t do that.&quot; Maslae said his sweet black brew \u2013 served Thai style for 30 baht (60p) in Pra Athit, the backpacker hub of Bangkok \u2013 was often praised by customers as tastier than that of Starbucks. &quot;I roast and mix my own recipe,&quot; he said. &quot;English tourists have become friends with me and love my coffee.

Abdel Hakim Belhaj and his wife Fatima accuse the government, MI6 and the former foreign secretary Jack Straw of false imprisonment, conspiracy to cause injury, abuse of public office and negligence. Belhaj&apos;s abduction in 2004 with the help of MI6 came to light when documents were found in Tripoli after Gaddafi&apos;s fall two years ago. They revealed that MI6&apos;s Sir Mark Allen congratulated the Libyan intelligence chief Moussa Koussa on the safe arrival of the &quot;air cargo&quot;, and noted that &quot;the intelligence [on Belhaj] was British&quot;. The government is expected to argue that the case should be thrown out because it would damage UK-US relations. It is also expected to argue the case is beyond British courts&apos; jurisdiction given the alleged unlawful acts took place with other states&apos; help, notably the US and Libya. Government lawyers have indicated that if necessary they will seek to have the case heard in secret courts set up this year by the Justice and Security Act. Whitehall&apos;s use of secret courts to save itself from embarrassment, rather than to protect national security as claimed, has been dramatically exposed by the revelation that the Ministry of Defence tried to prevent the disclosure of the treatment of prisoners captured by UK forces in Afghanistan. Part of a secret high court judgment which has now been disclosed reveal that an alleged Taliban leader, identified only as Detainee 806, was handed over by the British to a prison in Kabul despite a moratorium banning the transfer of prisoners there because of its reputation for torture. The judgment, now declassified, states that Dr Amrullah Saleh, the chief of the Afghan National Directorate of Security, persuaded British officials to hand over Detainee 806, after giving his personal assurance that he would be treated humanely and would be allowed weekly visits from the British. According to a witness statement by a senior Foreign Office official \u2013 which was also kept secret at the original court hearings in 2010 \u2013 the decision to comply with Saleh&apos;s request was taken by then Labour foreign secretary David Miliband and armed forces Minister Bill Rammell on the grounds that the prisoner could more easily be prosecuted in Kabul. Evidence in the newly declassified judgment, obtained after a legal challenge by the Mail on Sunday, showed that despite Saleh&apos;s promises, Detainee 806 &quot;disappeared&quot; for a month. When he finally met two British army personnel, he told them he had been beaten with steel rods about his legs and feet, punched in the head, torso, arms and testicles, and deprived of sleep for days. On a subsequent visit, he said he had also been whipped with electric cables. Some of his injuries were photographed. The judgment said the judges could not determine the prisoner&apos;s credibility, but it added: &quot;We consider that the only safe way to proceed is on the assumption that the allegations are true.&quot; Nevertheless, the judges said in 2010 that there was no good reason to make his claims public. &quot;The public interest considerations in favour of non-disclosure ought in our view to prevail.&quot; The MoD had asked for the evidence and judgment in the case to stay secret to protect national security and preserve relations with the Afghan government. They also said disclosure might put prisoners at risk of reprisals. Referring to the Afghan prisoner case, the former shadow home secretary David Davis told the Mail on Sunday: &quot;Far from protecting national security, this was about hiding political embarrassment. &quot;The fact David Miliband broke our own moratorium and handed over a prisoner to be tortured is a clear matter of public concern, which using a secret court covered up. This is a very bad harbinger for the secret justice procedures which the new Act creates.&quot; Neither Miliband nor Rammell responded to the paper&apos;s requests for comment. Sapna Malik, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day representing Belhaj and his wife, said on Sunday: &quot;[This case is] the latest attempt by the UK government to deploy dubious legal arguments and political scaremongering to defer having to answer the simple allegations at the heart of this case, to stand up in court and admit what the UK&apos;s role was in this sordid affair and who authorised it. &quot;All our clients want to hear is the truth followed by an apology. This would cost much less than the expensive delaying tactics the government is using to fight this case.&quot; Malik added that the British government had paid out more than \u00a32m to the family of the Libyan dissident Sami al-Saadi, who was also rendered back to Gaddafi, but Belhaj and his wife wanted to pursue the case so the full evidence could be heard. Cori Crider of the law charity and human rights group Reprieve said: &quot;Instead of coming clean and apologising, which is all Mr Belhaj and his wife are looking for, the government is fighting tooth and nail to stop the case coming to trial.&quot; Belhaj was living in China in 2004, after heading a low-level insurgency against the Gaddafi regime during the 1990s as leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. He and his wife decided to seek asylum in the UK but were detained in Malaysia and Bangkok, where they were handed over to US authorities before being rendered to Tripoli.", "publicationDate": "2013-10-20T16:10:16Z", "tags": ["Libya", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa", "World news", "Rendition", "CIA", "US news", "MI6", "UK security and counter-terrorism", "UK news", "Jack Straw", "Politics", "Abdel Hakim Belhaj"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/20/libyan-politician-uk-role-rendition-secret", "title": "Libyan politician to fight UK attempt to keep role in his rendition secret", "sentences": ["He and his wife decided to seek asylum in the UK but were detained in Malaysia and Bangkok, where they were handed over to US authorities before being rendered to Tripoli."]}, {"article": "A case brought by a leading Libyan dissident who accuses MI6, MI5 and the former foreign secretary, Jack Straw, of complicity in the abduction that led to his torture must be struck out because any unlawful act took place in a foreign country and not in the UK, government lawyers told the high court on Monday. &quot;The core of the claims relate to alleged acts of foreign states outside this country,&quot; Rory Phillips QC said, referring to evidence that Abdul Hakim Belhaj and his Moroccan wife, Fatima Boudchar, were seized in China in 2004, then deported to Malaysia and subsequently flown to Thailand, ostensibly en route to London, where they were to seek asylum. At Bangkok, they were put on a flight to Tripoli, where they were jailed and tortured. The abduction of Belhaj and his wife with the help of MI6 came to light when documents were found in Tripoli after Muammar Gaddafi&apos;s fall two years ago.

From the witness box, Laurie Bristow, director for national security at the Foreign Office, claimed that if the case went ahead, there was a danger that MI6 operations and those of foreign states would be exposed. Asked by Richard Hermer QC, for Belhaj, whether the Foreign Office ever before had demanded the exclusion of evidence relating to torture, Bristow replied : &quot;I can&apos;t answer that question.&quot; Asked about documents, widely available on the internet, spelling out the UK&apos;s involvement in the secret rendition of Belhaj and his wife to Libya, Bristow responded: &quot;The issue is about whether we confirm or deny actions of the intelligence services.&quot; The traditional policy of successive British governments is to &quot;neither confirm nor deny&quot; claims made by critics of MI5 and MI6.

The &quot;Citra search for clear, soft and glowing skin&quot; asked female students to submit photographs of themselves in their university uniform along with a bottle of Citra Pearly White UV body lotion, for a reward of 100,000 baht (\u00a32,000). Citra is a Thai subsidiary of Unilever. The advert \u2013 broadcast on Thai TV and YouTube \u2013 showed two female students, one lighter-skinned and another darker-skinned, who were asked what could make them &quot;outstanding in uniform&quot;. The darker-skinned girl seemed incapable of answering, while the fairer one \u2013 whom presenters described as &quot;beautiful&quot; \u2013 said Citra products could help. The advert sparked a debate over skin tone and education levels. Many believed the inference to be that darker-skinned students are less intelligent than their lighter-skinned colleagues in a country where fairer skin has long been equated with higher class \u2013 as a whiter complexion suggests a life not spent toiling on a farm. Although the advert was withdrawn last week the scholarship competition still stands. Contestants have a chance to enter until 31 October and their skin will be judged on &quot;product efficacy&quot;, with winners allowed to spend the funds as they choose. Skin-whitening products abound in Thailand, as they do all over south-east Asia, with pale models advertising cosmetics, pills and diet supplements to lighten dark complexions. Products promise &quot;the miracle of white skin&quot; at the same time that common Thai insults use darker skin as a subject of denigration, like dam mhuen e-ga, &quot;black like a crow&quot;. Much of the debate over the Citra advert raged online in popular forums such as Pantip.com, where users questioned why a skin-whitening product should even be related to a university scholarship. &quot;Now you can get a scholarship because of white skin \u2013 not because of good studying, not if you are poor and dark,&quot; user MyOwnDream was quoted as saying in the Bangkok Post. Unilever Thai Trading said it never intended &quot;to suggest racial discrimination&quot; and apologised for &quot;any misunderstandings regarding the campaign&quot;. It said: &quot;The Citra brand will exercise greater sensitivity for brand activation campaigns that take place in the future.&quot; Thailand is no stranger to race-based controversy. In September, a Dunkin&apos; Donuts ad had to be withdrawn after human rights groups complained about a model in blackface makeup advertising a &quot;charcoal donut&quot;, while in May an advert for a skin-whitening drink that featured a brown bear, a black doctor and a Thai woman in blackface was also deemed racially insensitive.", "publicationDate": "2013-10-27T15:38:16Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Race issues", "Unilever", "Business"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/27/thailand-racism-unilever-skin-whitening-cream-citra", "title": "Thailand racism row reignited by Unilever ad for skin-whitening cream", "sentences": ["&quot;Now you can get a scholarship because of white skin \u2013 not because of good studying, not if you are poor and dark,&quot; user MyOwnDream was quoted as saying in the Bangkok Post."]}, {"article": "Name: Saffron Bells LtdCity: WendoverWebsite: www.saffronbells.com  Saffron Bells \u2013 the UK&apos;s only luxury baby anklet label \u2013 launched from the glossy white desk in my home office.

Tony Abbott told reporters in Melbourne on Thursday that he would not make public comment on intelligence matters in keeping with longstanding practice, but he suggested any activity being undertaken by Australian agencies or officials was entirely lawful. &quot;Well, the thing about every Australian governmental agency is that we all operate in accordance with the law,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;Every Australian governmental agency, every Australian official, at home and abroad, operates in accordance with the law and that&apos;s the assurance that I can give people at home and abroad \u2013 our people operate in accordance with law,&quot; he said. &quot;Now, as for the precise workings of our intelligence organisations, it&apos;s been a long-standing practice not to comment on them.&quot; Fairfax reported on Thursday that intelligence collection under a program codenamed Stateroom occurred from Australian embassies in Jakarta, Bangkok, Hanoi, Beijing and Dili, and High Commissions in Kuala Lumpur and Port Moresby, as well as other diplomatic posts. The new report draws on a leaked US National Security Agency document from whistleblower Edward Snowden, published by German publication Der Spiegel. The document revealed an intelligence gathering program undertaken both from US diplomatic posts and from posts of the &quot;five eyes&quot; intelligence partners. That group includes Australia. The Stateroom program reportedly intercepts telecommunications and internet traffic. Fairfax says the document explicitly states that the Australian Defence Signals Directorate operates Stateroom facilities &quot;at Australian diplomatic facilities&quot;. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has declined to comment on the report. The extent of covert US data mining and surveillance, being revealed iteratively through the documents obtained by Snowden and published internationally by The Guardian and other news outlets, is creating political and diplomatic reverberations around the world. The Obama administration in Washington was left red faced by the recent revelation that German chancellor Angela Merkel had her phone tapped by intelligence agencies. South Australian independent senator Nick Xenophon, who has been attempting to probe the extent of surveillance activities undertaken by Australian agencies since Snowden first revealed the existence of the Prism program in the US, has called for a review of data collection activities. Xenophon&apos;s questions to both the former Labor government and the new Coalition government have thus far met with stonewalling. He intends to hold a summit on the international surveillance scandal and the activities of the US National Security Agency in Australia. A recent freedom of information (FoI) request by the ABC confirmed that the Australian government was made aware of the top-secret Prism program two months before The Guardian published the first stories in collaboration with Snowden. The FoI request confirmed a protected brief was prepared for the Australian attorney general on Prism on 21 March 2013, but the document was withheld from release by the Attorney General&apos;s Department on national security grounds. Xenophon said on Thursday that only a transparent conversation could bring relevant facts to light in the public interest. &quot;There&apos;s a difference between genuine national security \u2013 keeping a country safe \u2013 and using it for other purposes, and that&apos;s why we need to have a debate in this country,&quot; Xenophon told Sky News on Thursday.", "publicationDate": "2013-10-31T05:41:00Z", "tags": ["Australia news", "Prism", "Tony Abbott", "Nick Xenophon", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/31/abbott-assurance-on-australian-agencies", "title": "Tony Abbott says Australian agencies operate entirely within the law", "sentences": ["&quot;Now, as for the precise workings of our intelligence organisations, it&apos;s been a long-standing practice not to comment on them.&quot; Fairfax reported on Thursday that intelligence collection under a program codenamed Stateroom occurred from Australian embassies in Jakarta, Bangkok, Hanoi, Beijing and Dili, and High Commissions in Kuala Lumpur and Port Moresby, as well as other diplomatic posts."]}, {"article": "     The photo arrives with a ping on Srijula Baramee&apos;s mobile as her boyfriend drives her through another red light, dodging cars and trucks at 95mph en route to a crash near one of Bangkok&apos;s many freeways. &quot;Ooh,&quot; Srijula says loudly over the sirens and crackling two-way radios of their four-door coupe, as she looks at the image with a grimace. &quot;This is a bad one.&quot; Hurtling through Bangkok&apos;s notoriously bad traffic late on a Saturday night, Srijula \u2013 known as Ju \u2013 and Jakkarin Panikabut, 20, rely on police radio to help them identify the details of the latest accident: a motorbike collision with an 18-wheeler, one suspected dead, another injured. As volunteers with the Ruamkatanyu Foundation \u2013 a private organisation that supports the capital&apos;s fledgling emergency services \u2013 the two university students spend many of their evenings attending to Bangkok&apos;s wounded and dead, all in the name of earning good karma. Whether it&apos;s a murder or a car crash, volunteers such as Ju and Jakkarin are often first on the scene, bypassing police to provide basic medical care to those in need and radioing for more advanced help if needed. Many of them keep connected to one another via mobile chat networks, where they share details and photos of the latest crash or emergency \u2013 partly out of macabre interest, but also to stay informed of the city&apos;s daily injuries and deaths. &quot;I&apos;ve seen all sorts of things doing this,&quot; says Ju, a 21-year-old media student, as she and Jakkarin look over the remains of the motorbike rider, so mangled that only fingerprints will help identify her at the morgue. &quot;You come across people who have drowned or rotted for days at home, or people so badly smashed up, their brains and organs are outside their bodies.&quot; Despite a widespread fear of ghosts, most Thais believe that helping others \u2013 be they injured or dead \u2013 allows people to earn karmic merit, which explains why volunteers range from taxi drivers and messengers to factory workers and socialites. &quot;It definitely doesn&apos;t make you popular with the girls, because you spend so many evenings out on the road,&quot; says Chayapol Wattana, a 26-year-old businessman. &quot;But it&apos;s a service to society and it&apos;s addictive.&quot; Most volunteers protect themselves with amulets to ward off evil spirits. But Noppadon Sritongkham, 44, deputy chief of Ruam Katanyu&apos;s rescue and training, believes it is the ghosts themselves who protect him from the dangers of the living world. He recounts a tale of nearly being beaten a few years back by a mob of angry volunteers from a rival foundation \u2013 fist fights were common until the government divided up the city into two separate geographical &quot;emergency zones&quot; \u2013 but claims he was protected by a group of ghosts posing as the living. &quot;The rivals told me later: &apos;We couldn&apos;t get close to your car because it was surrounded by strangers, so we had to back off,&apos;&quot; Noppadon laughs. &quot;But there was only my friend and I in the car that night, no one else. I believe that because I&apos;ve helped bring [the dead] to the place where they belong, then they will, in turn, take care of me.&quot; Working the graveyard shift from 8pm to 8am, the volunteers split into teams with foundation employees and station themselves under freeway overpasses, at petrol stations or in empty car parks, where they sit and wait. Nibbling on snacks, they keep one ear tuned to their walkie-talkies and radios while trading stories of recent cases. In a city where violent crime and traffic accidents are fairly common, says Noppadon, the wait isn&apos;t usually too long. Volunteers work on behalf of the organisation, which was founded in 1970 to help Bangkok&apos;s poor bury their dead, but they buy their own essentials, such as the green uniforms, two-way radios, flashing roof lights and car seals with the Ruamkatanyu logo, with some volunteers spending up to 1m baht (\u00a320,000) turning their cars into ad hoc ambulances. Although some of the volunteers, including Chayapol and Ju, have undergone basic first aid, many of them have not \u2013 which has created its own problems. &quot;Sometimes victims will say [to the volunteers], &apos;Who are you? Why are you here?&apos;&quot; says Dr Pairoj Kruekarnchana, director of Rajavithi hospital&apos;s Narenthorn emergency medical centre in Bangkok, which has established state-liaised emergency service centres all over Thailand. &quot;They are not happy a volunteer is there first, especially if the volunteer has had no training, so now we are looking at getting all the volunteers [medically] accredited.&quot; Thailand operates a two-tier emergency support system, sending out &quot;basic teams&quot; to accident or crime scenes first, only followed by an advanced life-support ambulance if deemed to be needed. These &quot;basic teams&quot; provide a much-needed service and account for roughly 60% of the emergency cases Bangkok&apos;s hospitals see every year, according to Pairoj. &quot;But most patients in Bangkok still come to hospital by taxi or are driven by their friends or family because of traffic,&quot; he adds. &quot;In many instances, we&apos;ve seen patients leave the accident before the ambulance has even had a chance to arrive.&quot; As the volunteers wait for the next call at tonight&apos;s base \u2013 a major junction underneath a freeway overhang on Bangkok&apos;s outskirts \u2013 many drivers honk their horn and bow as they drive past as a sign of respect to the foundation.

Although it&apos;s not just an issue confined to the developing world, the scale of the problem in the south is clear: of the world&apos;s 1.2 billion youths, 87% live in the developing world. A data visualisation from the World Economic Forum shows 341 million are not in employment or education in the developing world, compared to 16.7 million in the EU. The EU development commissioner Andris Piebalgs has said that youth unemployment is now &quot;firmly on the international agenda&quot; but what can be done in practical and policy terms to tackle an issue of this scale? Is it about ensuring our education systems reflect the demands of the job market, internship schemes or does the solution lie in changing our labour market policies? A recent report from ODI, War Child, Restless Development and Youth Business International argues that &quot;most young people in the developing world face little prospect of obtaining a job in the formal sector; for many, self-employment is the only option&quot;. While organisations such as Iftiin Foundation have highlighted entrepreneurship as a way of redirecting youth energy away from violence and towards innovation, not everyone is convinced. Claudia Pompa from ODI has argued that there is remarkably little evidence about what works and what doesn&apos;t. So how can entrepreneurship programmes best be designed, implemented and delivered in a way that maximises their benefit to young people and the wider economy? How do you tailor programmes to reflect the diverse set of needs and aspirations of young people? What does success look like when implementing programmes in places where there is little or no cultural precedent of risk taking? How can business, government and civil society work together to finance and develop these programmes? And is entrepreneurship a solution that suits everyone?

The rain, the mud, the agonisingly steep incline \u2026 all those things I could handle. But the sleet, driven into my eyes, nose and mouth by a force nine gale? That was harsh. Still, an unexpected blast of icy sludge to the nostrils did at least alert me to the reality of\u00a0the situation: I was on holiday again. It&apos;s November, and last week I finally went on my summer holiday \u2013 three days of hiking in Herefordshire. As you can probably deduce, I&apos;d been putting it off for a while, ostensibly on the grounds that I had &quot;too much work on&quot;, but also on the grounds that holidays are best avoided. My holiday CV is not glowing. There was the driving trip in Northern Ireland that began with oysters and ended in details I am forbidden from sharing due to the 1959 Obscene Publications Act. There was the &quot;getting away from London&quot; holiday that one of my friends mistakenly booked on a fetching part of dual carriageway along the A3. And there was a romantic mini-break in Lisbon that involved a hangover so severe (yes, we tried the barman&apos;s &quot;experimental egg cocktail&quot;) that it led to one of the most emotionally barren days of my life \u2013 and I speak as someone who once spent a\u00a0Saturday on the road with Pete Doherty. For most of my life I seem to have taken the famous line from Withnail &amp; I \u2013 &quot;We&apos;ve gone on holiday by mistake&quot; \u2013 not so much as a quip but a life mantra. The recent talk of danger-zone tourism \u2013 where places such as Egypt, Afghanistan and Libya vie for the tourist dollar \u2013 baffles me. Surely a holiday is gruelling enough without throwing kidnappings and warlords into the equation? What hope would I have of traversing a rickety rope-bridge on the run from armed militias, when I struggle with gentle hiking in Herefordshire (especially when the hot water runs out by 9am)? Now, I know what you may be thinking: what did I expect? But I&apos;ve tried more exotic locations. Didn&apos;t work out too well for me. There was the time I landed in Bangkok only to discover that I was being sued by Morrissey and was legally obliged to take the next flight home. Even my honeymoon was tinged with farce. Of course, it&apos;s not for me to tell anyone how to enjoy their post-nuptial vacation, but I&apos;d suggest that it&apos;s never a good sign when the three most memorable things are: seeing a decapitated lizard washed up on the beach; your travel agent &quot;forgetting&quot; to book you a flight home; and going to Lombok hospital&apos;s A&amp;E department to have a fish bone surgically removed from your throat (obviously the nurse couldn&apos;t see said bone so proceeded to shove a variety of long metal implements down my throat until I retched it up). I&apos;ve fared no better on &quot;lads&quot; holidays. A university reunion break involved boating down the Fens \u2013 my suggestion, as I was reading Graham Swift&apos;s Waterland at the time. I accept that maybe this one was all my fault. The book was mainly concerned with uninhabitable marshlands \u2013 apart from the bits that focused on incest, abortion and child abduction. A freezing cold boat trip through Cambridgeshire wasn&apos;t your typical #UniLad affair, but I&apos;d already learned from experience that I wasn&apos;t cut out for those. An 18-30s holiday when I was 17 put paid to that. It&apos;s definitely something when you can say that girls bombarding your hotel balcony with used tampons wasn&apos;t the grimmest aspect of a trip. That honour belonged to the person who broke into our bedroom on the\u00a0first night and took a dump in the sink. However, I&apos;ve recently started to accept the value of a terrible holiday. This change of opinion began earlier this year when I foolishly agreed to climb a mountain in Glencoe with my dad \u2013 an attempt to become the ruddy-cheeked, outdoorsy son he&apos;d always longed for. The night before, informed of a dismal forecast, I thought &quot;here we go again&quot; \u2013 and sure enough, we reached the top, nearly 4,000ft up, to find the view entirely obscured by clouds. But then we descended to a ridge and I saw something that stopped me in my tracks: a\u00a0circular rainbow of light framing my silhouette. At first I thought it was confirmation of something I&apos;ve long believed \u2013 that I am some kind of all-powerful deity, put on this world to spread peace, love and serenity via occasional columns in the Guardian. But no, it was \u2013 my dad excitedly told me \u2013 a &quot;Brocken spectre&quot;. He was awestruck. Apparently it&apos;s rare to spot one \u2013 it depends on a perfect combination of low cloud and the right type of light. It was genuinely astonishing. In fact, it felt like vindication for a lifetime of awful holidays \u2013 a rainbow-coloured light at the end of a vomit, fishbone and sleet-strewn tunnel. And it was a reminder that when things seem most doomed to failure, a\u00a0moment of magic can leap out from nowhere. After all, even bad holidays have their bonus points. They imprint themselves on your brain with more force than any number of beautiful sunsets or fine dining experiences. The honeymoon turned out well \u2013 my devoted wife still laughs heartily about me having metal forceps thrust down my throat. Every cloud, it seems, has a silver lining \u2013 even the ones that emerge the minute you sit down on the beach and then proceed to pour down on\u00a0you for the next fortnight.", "publicationDate": "2013-11-17T20:00:00Z", "tags": ["Travel"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/17/who-needs-sunsets-bad-holidays-magical", "title": "Who needs sunsets and fine dining?

They deliver the sick to Wang Pha clinic, a whitewashed bungalow on the Thai riverbank \u2013 and one of the few clinics in Mae Sot offering free healthcare to Burmese people living on both sides of the border. Many of Wang Pha&apos;s patients are invisible to national governments: some are stateless; others are undocumented illegal migrants, internally displaced people or refugees marooned for decades. Now, however, they find themselves at the centre of a battle to contain a new form of malaria, a mosquito-borne disease that the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates kills 660,000 people a year. Last year researchers at the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit (SMRU), which runs Wang Pha, analysed 3,000 patient blood samples taken between 2001 and 2010. They noticed that artemisinin, the most effective antimalarial drug to date, was taking ever longer to clear malaria parasites from infected patients. &quot;This is the hallmark of drug resistance,&quot; says Professor Francois Nosten, SMRU&apos;s director. &quot;We don&apos;t know how bad this will become, but if it continues to worsen then maybe one day the drug will become completely ineffective. &quot;We&apos;re worried that this resistance can spread to other parts of the world, especially to Africa, where the transmission of malaria is much higher,&quot; he adds. This has happened before. In the late 1950s, resistance to the antimalarial drug chloroquine was first discovered in south-east Asia. It eventually spread to Africa and, according to a 2001 study reported in the Lancet, the numbers of malaria deaths and hospital admissions doubled or trebled as a result. Experts at the World Malaria Conference 2012 predicted that if artemisinin resistance is left to follow a similar path, global malaria deaths will increase by 25%. At Wang Pha, Burmese farmer Sow Htun Haung has been diagnosed with Plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly malaria strain. He waited eight days to seek help and he looks jaundiced. Doctors hope he&apos;ll stay for three days so they can monitor his treatment, but every day Sow doesn&apos;t work, he won&apos;t get paid. Ensuring people consult medical professionals, access the correct drugs and complete their course of treatment is essential to combating drug resistance \u2013 but among mobile, cross-border populations, this is a challenge. Over the past three years, the Thai government has allocated between \u00a36-10m to treat migrants, but this isn&apos;t\u00a0just a funding issue. Some migrants fear arrest or deportation if they go to public hospitals. For Nosten, the emergence of artemisinin resistance in Mae Sot is a sign that efforts to contain drug-resistant malaria have already &quot;failed&quot;. Resistance was first discovered in 2006 in the Cambodian town of Pailin, which borders Thailand. Scientists aren&apos;t yet certain whether it spread or emerged in Mae Sot independently. In Pailin at least, efforts to contain drug\u2011resistant malaria, supported by international NGO Malaria Consortium, are intensifying. In 2011 Hun Sen, the Cambodian prime minister, announced his intention to eliminate malaria in Cambodia by 2025. This,\u00a0together with increased international funding, acted as a catalyst for new containment projects. By 2012, village malaria workers had been trained in 1,600 Cambodian villages. Their role is to educate the community about malaria, and to diagnose and treat simple malaria cases, thereby shortening the window for malaria transmission. In artemisinin-resistance hotspots, drug inspectors are also ensuring that antimalarials are no longer available in the private sector to try to crack down on inferior drugs that could hamper treatment and increase resistance. High stakes Overall, the number of cases has fallen, and no one has died from malaria in Pailin since 2009, but artemisinin resistance has continued to rise. Drugs have become so ineffective here that P Falciparum patients are now treated with the top-of-the-range medicine Malarone. This costs $55 per course, compared to just $1-2 for\u00a0artemisinin-based treatments. Some experts believe the risks are so high that it&apos;s time to take drastic action. &quot;At the moment, the strategy seems to be for everyone to just try harder at what they&apos;re already doing,&quot; argues Dr Nick White, professor of tropical medicine at Bangkok&apos;s Mahidol University. &quot;We need to take risks. Imagine bird flu was coming to England and killing people \u2013 we wouldn&apos;t just say &apos;oh carry on chaps,&apos; we&apos;d do something rather more about it.&quot; He wants WHO to investigate radical interventions, like mass-treating the population with antimalarials or screening for malaria at all borders and airports. Malaria Consortium and partners are piloting one such initiative in Pailin, Stung Treng and Ratanakiri provinces, carrying out\u00a0tests for malaria at official and unofficial border crossings. &quot;Intensifying screening activities and identifying asymptomatic cases becomes key in the malaria\u00a0elimination context. We&apos;ve been actively finding these cases with some success,&quot; says Arantxa Roca-Feltrer, an epidemiologist and technical co-ordinator for Malaria Consortium in Cambodia. Dr Pascal Ringwald, head of WHO&apos;s drug-resistance and containment unit, says WHO is researching some of these options, but sees no reason for alarm. &quot;We don&apos;t know how artemisinin resistance will spread. We think [it] might have appeared in south-east Asia in 2001 and till now it has only reached Myanmar [Burma]. In 12 years chloroquine resistance spread from east to west Africa.&quot; But, if artemisinin resistance emerged in 2001, this means it took five years to\u00a0detect. &quot;This is what happens with resistance: it&apos;s under your nose for a long time before it becomes obvious,&quot; says White. Projects like Tracking Resistance to Artemisinin Collaboration (TRAC), funded by the UK government Department for International Development (DfID), are monitoring 15 sites, including three in Africa, and have so far found no evidence of artemisinin resistance beyond south-east Asia. But the scope of such projects is limited. Scientists can&apos;t rule out that artemisinin resistance has already spread to Africa. Increased air travel only augments the risks. Theoretically one person with artemisinin-resistant malaria travelling from Thailand to Africa could be enough to spread the disease, so the most robust response would be international. At Wang Pha, doctors will continue treating boatloads of the poor and displaced, and monitoring artemisinin resistance, but Nosten already sounds resigned. Perhaps when artemisinin resistance is found beyond south-east Asia the world will take radical action, he suggests. &quot;But then it will be too late.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-11-22T09:47:00Z", "tags": [], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/nov/22/drug-resistant-malaria-on-cambodian-border", "title": "Drug-resistant malaria on the Cambodian border: a new health challenge", "sentences": ["&quot;At the moment, the strategy seems to be for everyone to just try harder at what they&apos;re already doing,&quot; argues Dr Nick White, professor of tropical medicine at Bangkok&apos;s Mahidol University."]}, {"article": "Thousands of demonstrators are calling for prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra to step down amid claims that her government is controlled by her older brother, ousted former leader Thaksin Shinawatra.

The biggest impact of promoting entrepreneurship will be to change cultural attitudes to taking risk, building confidence and becoming part of the global community. We should be living and breathing partnerships: No one sector has a monopoly on solving youth unemployment. The public sector plays its role best when providing reasonably-priced capital and creating an enabling environment Established business (including the financial sector) has the skills, the supply chains, microfranchising etc. and the incentives (licence to operate) and most of all, individuals who mentor provide that invaluable personal development asset to the entrepreneur. Matthieu Cognac, youth employment specialist, International Labour Organisation, Bangkok, Thailand. @mattcognac To become a successful entrepreneur you need an enabling financial environment: We should be creating an environment where access to finance is based more on the capacity of repayment than it is on the availability of collateral. Registering a business should be an open and painless process for young entrepreneurs. We can also do this by providing support packages that combine training, access to finance and mentoring. These work better than only delivering stand-alone interventions. Partnerships work particularly well at the local and community level: Local economic development programmes can do wonders when they include young people, government, the private sector and civil society with a common aim to identify competitive and comparative advantages for the sake of economic growth. Claudia Pompa, researcher on markets and the private sector, Overseas Development Institute, London, UK. @claupompa For entrepreneurship to work, it needs to be at the core of how education systems operate: The World Economic Forum report Educating the next wave of entrepreneurs and the McKinsey&apos;s report Education to Employment: Designing a System that Works hint at some best practices and experiences that could be relevant and useful in this regard. There are some excellent examples from across the world about teaching entrepreneurship at different levels such as Junior Achievement, an NGO which works across the world at all levels of primary and secondary school and Aflatoun which focuses on primary school students. They are both very good at teaching not only the technical skills, but also the soft skills needed to succeed as an entrepreneur such as confidence, communication, leadership and team work. Marieme Jamme, founder, Spot One Global Solutions, London, UK. @mjamme Pick your mentors carefully: Many people want to become mentors to young entrepreneurs, but not anybody can be a good mentor. Big companies need to bear in mind that mentors need to have the appropriate skills for this role. We must not be timid about asking questions to well-meaning mentors and matching people correctly. In Africa, inter-regional learning between entrepreneurs is key: I have found that the west Africans are not connected to the east Africans but share lots in common. For example, west Africans develop or create many of the same companies/products as east Africans but French. Maybe here we need to connect them more to share ideas. We did it at Africa Gathering 2013 this year, and it was epic. Sharing ideas across regions can go a long way to helping tackle youth unemployment in Africa. Paulette Cohen, head of global programmes, Barclays, London, UK. @BarclaysOnline Working in partnership can help ensure scalable and sustainable programmes: Our experience suggests that working in partnership across all sectors, bringing together the knowledge of charity partners on the ground, business skills and experience, and forward-thinking government policies focused on supporting young entrepreneurs is one way to work towards scalable and sustainable programmes. We have seen success through this model in Zambia through Building Young Futures. Support young entrepreneurs to build the right skill set: Being prepared to fail is easier if you have the right skills to evaluate why and the right support to coach you through the next steps to move on. Barclays and UNICEF place a huge amount of emphasis on the financial, business and marketing skills, but we also provide support in gaining the softer skills that help build confidence and support the vocational skills young entrepreneurs may have. Margaret Mliwa, senior manager, Restless Development, Dodoma, Tanzania. @RestlessDev Encourage young entrepreneurs to find a unique business idea: Training alone is not enough to help young entrepreneurs survive in the business world. After training, young entrepreneurs all tend to start up more or less same enterprises. In my past experience with the Ministry Of Youth Affairs in Kenya and with Restless Development Tanzania what we have done is help young people identify something unique which is easily found within their environment and add value to it. Follow-up mechanisms need to be in place to track down the progress of young entrepreneurs: Support needs to continue once young people have finished their training, to support them with the challenges they may encounter. One of the main challenges we have seen them encounter is access to the market and the ability to ensure that they remain relevant in a competitive business environment. Isabel Kachinda, founder, Aunt Isabel Tailoring and Design, Lusaka, Zambia. In my experience as a young entrepreneur, government could do more to empower youths: For example, the Zambian government has started the Youth Development Fund to help young people start businesses. It&apos;s a good start but more can be done because there are a lot of youths who need support. Kate Wills, programme manager of Building Young Futures, Unicef, London, UK. @UNICEF Working with government can help bring your programme to scale: For example, encouraging governments to set up youth entrepreneurship funds, and encouraging government where possible to take the model and scale it up. In Pakistan we are currently working with the Punjab government to share our learnings and feed into their adolescent plans. In India this has already happened with the government of Maharashtra taking the programme on across the state. Case study from Brazil: As part of our Building Young Futures programme we have launched a new online initiative - which is a bit like a small scale LinkedIn. It encourages young people training to input their profiles and then links them to training, each other and encourages them to share ideas and access opportunities.

Then Democrat Party politicians led hundreds of protesters to the headquarters of TV channels 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 to pressure them to end &quot;biased reporting&quot;. &quot;Opposition groups have a right to protest peacefully, but that doesn&apos;t mean assaulting journalists,&quot; said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch (HRW). &quot;The Thai authorities need to allow anti-government demonstrations that are secure and don&apos;t degenerate into violent confrontations.&quot; Source: HRW", "publicationDate": "2013-11-27T08:27:37Z", "tags": ["Media", "Journalist safety", "Thailand", "Press freedom", "Human rights"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/nov/27/journalist-safety-thailand", "title": "Thai protesters assault journalists", "sentences": ["Anti-government protesters in Thailand have assaulted journalists at rallies in Bangkok who they believe supportive of the administration led by prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra."]}, {"article": "Eliza Anyangwe writes On 27 November 2012, as we launched the Guardian Global Development Professionals Network, I had high hopes but was frankly shit scared. What if no one would contribute in blogs or comments? Worse still, what if our readers gave us what Guardian writers have come to expect: a good dressing down in the comments. Vociferous personal attack. Guardian readers may now be accustomed to great coverage of the developing world (the network is preceded by the Katine project and Guardian Development) but what if the people who worked in the sector weren&apos;t ready to cast a lens on themselves or share best practice? What if it just wasn&apos;t possible to publish meatier content without the acronyms or talk of elite capture, capacity building and resilience? But with blogs in our first week from the likes of UN special rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier De Schutter, director for Europe at the Centre for Global Development, Owen Barder, and international development secretary, Justine Greening, and topics ranging from empowering girls with technology to racial equality at the World Bank, I needn&apos;t have worried about traffic.

Photograph: Alamy    EA: The cake&apos;s been eaten, the fizz drunk and Friday is making way for the weekend. But before we call it a night on our birthday celebrations, we have just one more story to share. A happy consequence of seeking our people with innovative ideas or lessons to share is that sometimes our readers are inspired to collaborate with our contributors. This tweet from Mari Shibata is one brilliant example:    Happy Birthday @GdnGlobalDevPro - making my first documentary film in Africa thanks to your network! #excited #differenceayearmakes&mdash; Mari (@intercultralist) November 29, 2013    We asked the independent filmmaker to tell us more and this is what she said:  I found the Guardian Global Development Professionals Network an invaluable resource to meet individuals with great ideas who I wouldn&apos;t come across otherwise. Through the Network, I have found a collaborator for a documentary film in Kenya which has gone on to win a pitching competition at the British Film Institute, funding from the British Universities Film and Video Council, and a screening at the United Nations&apos; We The Peoples Film Festival in 2014. Not only is it going to be my first documentary in a developing country, but the independent nature of it gives me the opportunity to develop my own style of working ... thanks to the Network!   That&apos;s one story. We hope not the only story. As with all our articles, the comments are open \u2013 tell us your stories of collaboration; keep telling us your stories of change and growth and email us with ideas for what we could do next year: globaldevpros@theguardian.com. For now though, from us all, thank you for making this year worthwhile. Our birthday wish is that we feature many, many more voices from the south. Help us make it come true!

What she does know, however, is what she doesn&apos;t want: the current Thai prime minister to stay in power. &quot;She is stupid! And all of Thailand knows that,&quot; said the whistle-wielding 27-year-old of Yingluck Shinawatra as she marched through Bangkok&apos;s downtown with thousands of others on Friday. &quot;I am Thai and this is my country, my government. I want her out!&quot; Primary school teacher Thanita could not answer what kind of government she would prefer, or just who she hoped would rule if Yingluck \u2013 who was democratically elected to power two years ago on the back of her ruling Puea Thai party \u2013 were to be toppled. &quot;Her brother Thaksin wants to destroy the monarchy,&quot; she shrugged, citing a familiar belief among anti-government protestors. &quot;I just want someone suitable to be prime minister.&quot; Other protestors marching alongside Thanita held up caricatures of a singing Yingluck with the message &quot;It&apos;s all lip-synching&quot;, a reference, it seemed, to the leader acting as a supposed puppet of her brother Thaksin, the former PM ousted in a military coup in 2006 who was widely accused of being anti-monarchy. The business tycoon now lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai after being convicted of corruption, charges he claims are politically motivated. It has been one week since whistle-blowing demonstrators in their thousands have taken to the streets to overthrow Yingluck&apos;s government \u2013 which they brand the &quot;Thaksin regime&quot; \u2013 storming army compounds, shutting off power to national police headquarters and occupying ministerial buildings. Although the embattled prime minister this week survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote and the number of protestors has dwindled as the week has worn on, more demonstrations are planned for Saturday, with protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban \u2013 a former deputy premier in the previous government \u2013 vowing to topple the government by Sunday. The instability has led many to worry that there could be a repeat of the violent 2010 clashes between pro-Thaksin &quot;red shirts&quot; and pro-monarchy &quot;yellow shirts&quot;, which saw over 100 killed and 2,000 injured when clashes turned violent. But there have already been reports of violence and intimidation against journalists during these most recent protests. A German photojournalist was assaulted at a rally on Monday after a protest leader singled him out in the crowd, and several Thai TV channels have been accused by demonstrators of being biased, with one Thai journalist coerced by a crowd into blowing a whistle \u2013 a symbol of the protestors calling out government corruption \u2013 before he was allowed back into his office building. Senior researcher Sunai Phasuk of Human Rights Watch said the &quot;showdown&quot; between protestors, government forces and all those in between was &quot;leading to a very precarious situation where violence seems to be inevitable&quot;. He added: &quot;Now the situation is so volatile and so fluid that we have to make an assessment on an hourly basis, chasing different strands of information from different factions [of the government].&quot; Yingluck has made numerous calls for negotiations with protestors and has prepared for violence by invoking the internal security act (ISA), which calls for road closures and curfews. Police have also issued an arrest warrant for protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban. But there have not yet been any explicit attempts to arrest the politician, with the government seemingly keen to wait out the storm rather than act on it. &quot;The government will not instigate a violent situation because that is exactly what Suthep wants,&quot; said Udomdet Rattanasatein, a Puea Thai lawmaker. &quot;We will not be provoked.&quot; Suthep himself has rejected any form of negotiation or dialogue until the so-called &quot;Thaksin regime&quot; has been ousted, and on Friday vowed to cut telecommunications and seize a number of government ministries, police headquarters and a zoo over the weekend. Protestors are operating from five different locations, including three downtown, one in a ministry and another in the northern suburbs. &quot;We all not let them work anymore,&quot; Suthep said of the current government. Suthep accuses Thaksin \u2013 and by default, his sister Yingluck \u2013 of having destroyed not only democracy in Thailand, but the &quot;virtues and ethics of the people&quot;. His plan, which critics have said is both too bold and too vague, is to overthrow the government and begin anew with a temporary, unelected &quot;people&apos;s council&quot; formed of various representatives, with the king as head of state. &quot;Then the country could get on the path to perfect democracy,&quot; he told the Thai news website Prachathai. The current instability in Thailand hinges on an ill-conceived amnesty bill promoted by Yingluck&apos;s government as an attempt to help calm simmering tensions after the 2006 coup. But critics believed the bill would have seen Thaksin&apos;s corruption conviction cleared and allowed the half-reviled, half-loved former leader to return to Thailand. Although the Thai senate rejected the bill and Yingluck said she accepted the decision, it stirred an already simmering pot of political tension between Thailand&apos;s rural poor and urban elite, with demonstrators voicing their grievances at what they allege is a puppet-led, corrupt administration, despite the fact that the ruling Puea Thai party has won a number of democratic elections over the last decade. Speaking to the BBC, Yingluck said the current political situation very sensitive but dismissed any possibility of an early election. &quot;I love this country. I devote myself to this country. I need only one thing for the country,&quot; she said. &quot;We need to protect democracy.&quot; Chulalongkorn University political scientist Panitan Wattanayakorn, a former government spokesman for Abhisit Vejajjiva, who ousted Thaksin in the 2006 coup, said this would be the prime minister&apos;s biggest political test, and could potentially work in her favour. &quot;This is the fight for her survival,&quot; said Panitan. &quot;Let&apos;s hope in the end the prime minister is now able to come out on her own and talk on her own agenda. That is what we are expecting if we want to get out of the crisis.&quot; Analysts believe both sides should reach some form of negotiation before the king&apos;s birthday on 5 December \u2013 a gesture of reverence to the much-loved monarch.", "publicationDate": "2013-11-29T16:51:45Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Thaksin Shinawatra", "Protest", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/29/bangkok-clashes-feared-anti-thaksin-protesters-yingluck-shinawatra", "title": "Repeat of 2010 Bangkok clashes feared as anti-Thaksin protesters march on", "sentences": ["And all of Thailand knows that,&quot; said the whistle-wielding 27-year-old of Yingluck Shinawatra as she marched through Bangkok&apos;s downtown with thousands of others on Friday."]}, {"article": "Football may be criticised for a lot of things but there are times when it can be an extraordinary tool in fighting everything from war to disease. In a week where the sport has been once again hit by match-fixing allegations it is worth looking to Africa to see how it can be used as an educational tool to save lives. It is World Aids Day and the Fifa-backed project TackleAfrica is reaching out to young children on the continent to teach them about HIV and sexual health education. The project is fulfilling a crucial and life-saving role, considering that many of these youngsters do not attend school and therefore have no sexual health education whatsoever. Laura Brooks has been in Kenya for the last three months, working as a TackleAfrica coaching development officer. &quot;The TackleAfrica model is to train local football coaches with high quality coaching skills so they can deliver our drills, and then they go out into their communities and coach. I&apos;ve been delivering lots of coaching courses to local coaches, all over Kenya, from the coast through Nairobi and all the way to Western near the Ugandan border. Wherever there is a need for our work, and we can secure funding, I&apos;ll go and train coaches. I then go with them into their communities and watch them deliver our drills and give them as much support as possible. &quot;The most rewarding moments come when you hear of actual behaviour change, a young player telling you they now have the confidence to get an HIV test, or a female coach saying they finally asked their boyfriend to use a condom for the first time. Like so many people I love football, so coaching and playing is obviously a great way to spend my days, but those moments are when you realise you may just have made a difference.&quot; TackleAfrica have developed a series of coaching exercises to demonstrate the dangers of HIV. For example, one drill gives each player a piece of paper which is placed in their sock, and they are then told to dribble against each other. At the end of the drill the pieces of paper are removed, and it is revealed that one \u2013 but only one \u2013 of them has &quot;HIV&quot; written on it, and that everyone else has &apos;risked infection&apos; by playing against them, thus demonstrating how the virus can be transmitted. The drill is arranged so that every player faces the HIV positive player directly or another player who has, showing that risky sexual behaviour can impact a whole community from one person with the virus. Another has players shooting at 10 goalkeepers, who are removed one-by-one as the drill progresses. The goal represents a body, while the keepers are white blood cells. The removal of the keepers represents how HIV breaks down the human body&apos;s natural defence systems. TackleAfrica work on the old &quot;Teach a man to fish \u2026&quot; principle, as their model is based on passing on the drills and techniques to local coaches, so that they can educate their own communities themselves. This also aims to ensure the message being put across is more deeply embedded \u2013 the ideas are much more likely to take hold if they are part of the community, rather than simply taught by an itinerant coach. The work they do not only helps with HIV education, but it inspires people worldwide. Hugh Thompson, for example, is cycling from London to Rio in time for the World Cup next summer, in order to raise money for TackleAfrica. &quot;In 2009 I went to Uganda as a volunteer for three weeks to deliver HIV education through football for TackleAfrica,&quot; he says. &quot;I was blown away by the impact the charity was making in the rural areas of Uganda but also how much it was required.&quot; Currently somewhere in Malaysia, Thompson has already passed through 16 countries, and has coached in Kampala, Dar Es Salaam and Hungary, visited projects in India, Uganda and Kenya, been knocked off his bike in Bangalore and Bangkok and had his nether regions grabbed in Thailand. It&apos;s been quite a journey so far, and he still has eight months and a couple of continents to go. And for anyone that might doubt how effective using football to spread this message is, it&apos;s worth noting that Brooks was in Kenya at the time of the shootings in Nairobi, when over 60 people were killed and others held hostage, and work continued. &quot;The way everyone united, donating blood, giving support and so on, was overwhelming and beautiful to witness,&quot; she says. &quot;As for my work, I carried on delivering training throughout that whole period. It will take a lot more than that to stop Kenyans playing football.&quot; \u2022 Visit Hugh Thompson&apos;s Ride2Rio website here", "publicationDate": "2013-11-30T19:41:00Z", "tags": ["Sport", "Football", "Aids and HIV", "Africa"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/30/tackle-africa-aids-sex-education-soccer", "title": "Football coaches determined to improve young Africans' sex education", "sentences": ["&quot;I was blown away by the impact the charity was making in the rural areas of Uganda but also how much it was required.&quot; Currently somewhere in Malaysia, Thompson has already passed through 16 countries, and has coached in Kampala, Dar Es Salaam and Hungary, visited projects in India, Uganda and Kenya, been knocked off his bike in Bangalore and Bangkok and had his nether regions grabbed in Thailand."]}, {"article": "     Two aged American heroes saunter on to small screens this week. No surprise that the one fighting fit is Clark Kent himself, back in moneyed, near-machine-like condition in Zack Snyder&apos;s sturdy, appropriately metallic and largely humourless Superman update Man of Steel (Warner, 12). Less expected is that it&apos;s dustily unfashionable lawman The Lone Ranger (Disney, 12) who gets far the more thrilling film. Unjustly maligned by critics who smelled blood as inevitable commercial failure loomed, it re-emerges on DVD looking to harvest as cultish a following as any Disney mega-production can hope for. Man of Steel may boast the airbrushed visual sheen and positively homoerotic muscularity that is Snyder&apos;s directorial signature, but it&apos;s otherwise focus-grouped to the nth degree: the dominant creative presence is not Snyder but producer Christopher Nolan, whose recent Batman trilogy set the tone of stern, stormy revisionism that this fellow DC\u00a0Comics adaptation obediently follows. It&apos;s not bad: seemingly drawn by Tom of Finland, Henry Cavill makes a fine new-model Superman, earnest enough to support the quasi-mythic approach the film takes to his all-too-familiar origin story. But it&apos;s not half as much fun as The Lone Ranger: seemingly made by Gore Verbinski as a knowing joke at Disney&apos;s considerable expense, it conjures nostalgia for the old west while castigating its blood-stained heritage. Armie Hammer plays John Reid, the eponymous masked sheriff, as a lovably square stooge, but it&apos;s Johnny Depp&apos;s Native American spirit warrior Tonto who is fashioned as the story&apos;s true star, as the pair avenge the deaths of Reid&apos;s brother and Tonto&apos;s entire tribe respectively. The plot, however, plays second fiddle to the film&apos;s embellishments and diversions: Depp&apos;s delightful Buster Keaton act is one reason of many to give this glorious folly another chance.     Johnny Depp as Tonto in The Lone Ranger. Photograph: Moviestore/Rex Features     I wouldn&apos;t pick either Reid or Kent in a fight against the redoubtable Kristin Scott Thomas, easily the best thing about two very different releases this week. Looking for Hortense (Arrow, 12) is the kind of thing we&apos;re used to seeing her in these days: a tasteful French comedy of manners that braids middle-aged marital strife with\u00a0makeweight immigration politics, in which Scott Thomas&apos;s strikingly tart but under-utilised turn as a frazzled stage director is the sole energy source. Rather more surprising is Nicolas Winding Refn&apos;s problematic but perversely mesmerising thriller Only God Forgives (Lionsgate, 18), a narrative-averse exercise in Asian design appropriation in which revenge is a dish best served slow. Except, that is, when Scott Thomas is around to spike things up as the ghastly mother of Ryan Gosling&apos;s obtusely inexpressive hero, a Bangkok drug runner whose brother is murdered by rival gangsters. Arriving to kick the retribution into high gear, the actress plays her underworld diva as equal parts Donatella Versace and Mae West, belittling her son&apos;s manhood in a riotous dinner scene unmatched by the rest of this handsome, nihilistic curio. Scott Thomas should really be in everything: perhaps she could even jazz up Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa (Studio Canal, 15), a\u00a0half-hearted big-screen graduation for Steve Coogan&apos;s naff Norwich DJ, which boasts as many belly-laughs as an average episode of his sitcom \u2013 several, then \u2013 dispersed across the length of three.

Following a young Michael Jackson impersonator from the streets of Paris to a Scottish commune of fellow starstruck identity thieves \u2013 including Samantha Morton&apos;s Marilyn Monroe \u2013 it&apos;s a gently sympathetic take on Hollywood-fed obsession and possession, with added nuns for good measure; recent Korine converts should check it out.", "publicationDate": "2013-12-01T00:01:03Z", "tags": ["DVD and video reviews", "Film", "Culture", "Superman", "Johnny Depp", "Christopher Nolan", "Kristin Scott Thomas", "Nicolas Winding Refn", "Alan Partridge", "Harmony Korine", "Steve Coogan"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/01/guy-lodge-dvds-man-steel-lone-ranger", "title": "Guy Lodge's DVDs and downloads", "sentences": ["Except, that is, when Scott Thomas is around to spike things up as the ghastly mother of Ryan Gosling&apos;s obtusely inexpressive hero, a Bangkok drug runner whose brother is murdered by rival gangsters."]}, {"article": "At least two people have been killed and more than 50 injured after a week of anti-government protests in Bangkok turned violent. Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets on Sunday in what organisers said was a final push to topple the embattled government. Some 30,000 protesters have gathered in various locations around the city \u2013 including government ministries, police headquarters, the prime minister&apos;s office and television stations \u2013 to take part in the so-called &quot;people&apos;s revolution&quot; with the aim of wresting control from the PM, Yingluck Shinawatra, and installing a &quot;people&apos;s council&quot;. Sporting whistles, flags and anti-government banners, protesters at Government House \u2013 home to Yingluck&apos;s offices \u2013 were met with teargas as they repeatedly attempted to break through concrete barriers and razor wire protecting the compound. Teargas and water cannon were also used in two other areas in the city. Many central businesses, including five major shopping malls, were closed for the day. The protesters believe Yingluck is a puppet of her brother Thaksin, the former PM ousted in a military coup in 2006 who was widely accused of being an anti-monarchist. The tycoon lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai after being convicted of corruption charges he claims were politically motivated.     The shootings on Saturday night occurred after scattered violence during the day. Photograph: Damir Sagolj/Reuters    The current instability in Thailand hinges on an ill-conceived amnesty bill promoted by Yingluck&apos;s government as an attempt to help calm simmering tensions after the 2006 coup. But critics believed the bill would have seen Thaksin&apos;s corruption conviction cleared and allowed the polarising former leader to return to Thailand. The prime minister was forced to flee to an unknown location after a planned press conference was scrapped when protesters stormed the police building where it was to be held, Reuters reported. While wresting control of the media is often seen as standard practice during a coup, the group leading the protests, the Civil Movement for Democracy (CMD), said it was not occupying the TV stations but merely negotiating with them to air an afternoon speech by the protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban. The managing director of Thai PBS, Somchai Suwanban, one of the stations taken over by protesters, insinuated otherwise, however. &quot;The longer the protesters occupy a public service TV, the more damage they have done to their pro-democracy claim&quot;, he tweeted. As protests continued late into Sunday afternoon, the government said it would send riot police to both the finance ministry and government complex in order to &quot;reclaim space&quot; from protesters, with unconfirmed reports of rubber bullets also being used against demonstrators. Unarmed troops were sent to rescue stranded students from Ramkhamhaeng University, near the spot where at least two people were killed on Saturday night during attacks between anti-government protesters and &quot;redshirt&quot; government supporters in a sports stadium. The two dead were a 21-year-old student anti-government protester and a 43-year-old redshirt guard. Fifty-four other people were injured. Redshirt leaders attempted to reduce tensions by calling on their supporters to go home; many of them returned to their northern provinces by bus. The head of the army, General Prayuth Chan-ocha, has offered to mediate between the two sides, the English-language paper the Nation reported, but it is unclear what Suthep will do next, as he has ignored repeated calls by Yingluck for negotiation and insisted that laws must be broken for protesters to achieve their goal \u2013 a vague plan for a non-elected &quot;people&apos;s council&quot; to run the country with the king as head of state.

In a televised address, deputy prime minister Pracha Promnok stressed that the embattled administration was still in control of the nation, even though Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra had been forced to flee protesters earlier in the day and her whereabouts were still unknown late on Sunday. Throwing stones and petrol bombs, and wielding knives and sticks, the protesters gathered in various locations around the city \u2013 including government ministries, police headquarters, the prime minister&apos;s office and television stations \u2013 with the aim of wresting control from Yingluck&apos;s democratically-elected government and installing a &quot;people&apos;s council&quot; of unelected representatives. After a week of largely peaceful demonstrations, during which anti-government protesters managed to cut electricity and telecommunications of state buildings, storm army headquarters and occupy ministerial offices, protests took a violent turn over the weekend as government opponents and supporters clashed across the city. Those killed were shot at a sports stadium early on Sunday where some 70,000 &quot;red shirts&quot; rallied in support of the government amid skirmishes with anti-government protesters, many of them students. There were also unconfirmed reports of another death after bones were allegedly found inside a burnt-out bus near the stadium later in the day. Yingluck&apos;s government has been careful to use as little force as possible against the protesters, but at Government House \u2013 home to the prime minister&apos;s offices \u2013 they were met with teargas as they repeatedly attempted to break through concrete barriers and razor wire. Teargas and water cannon were also used in two other areas in the city, with about 50 injured in the clashes, local media reported. Many businesses, including five major shopping malls, were closed for the day, with a number of schools and universities planning closures on Monday. The protesters \u2013 most of whom support the opposition Democrat party \u2013 believe Yingluck is a puppet of her brother Thaksin, the former PM ousted in a military coup in 2006 who was widely accused of being an anti-monarchist. The tycoon lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai after being convicted of corruption charges he claims were politically motivated. The instability in Thailand hinges on an amnesty bill promoted by Yingluck&apos;s government as an attempt to calm tensions after the 2006 coup. Clashes between &quot;red shirt&quot; Thaksin supporters and &quot;yellow shirt&quot; opponents have occurred on and off for the past seven years, the most violent taking place in 2010, when some 2,000 were injured and nearly 100 killed during a violent military crackdown. Critics believed the amnesty bill would have seen Thaksin&apos;s corruption conviction cleared and allowed the polarising former leader to return to Thailand, where many believe he would again try to run the country. Despised by the urban, educated, royalist elite, Thaksin and his allies hold the support of the poor rural north thanks to populist policies such as farming schemes and universal healthcare. Although Yingluck shelved the amnesty bill, protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban \u2013 a former deputy prime minister in the previous Democrat government \u2013 has vowed to keep fighting and, in a brief meeting with the leader said he had given the prime minister two days to &quot;return the power to the people&quot;. Suthep has so far ignored requests for mediation and negotiation, including those by Yingluck herself, and said their meeting today was &quot;no negotiation and no compromise&quot;. &quot;This is the only [meeting] and there will be no more until a victory for the people,&quot; he added. It was unclear why police \u2013 who have taken out a warrant for Suthep&apos;s arrest given his role in the protests \u2013 did not detain him at the time. It was still unknown where Yingluck was riding out the political storm, but Thaksin&apos;s lawyer, Noppadon Pattama, told Reuters she was still in Bangkok. &quot;For safety reasons, we cannot disclose her location,&quot; he said, adding that Thaksin himself had also pleaded with the government to show restraint with the protesters. &quot;The government must be the bigger person in this scenario,&quot; he said.

Protest leaders had stressed they would not negotiate and promised to continue their efforts to oust Yingluck Shinawatra&apos;s administration. But with Tuesday came an unexpected twist as police took down barriers shielding their headquarters and let protesters in \u2013\u00a0seemingly to defuse demonstrators threats&apos; to seize the building by force. Police also watched idly as crowds breached the barricades around Government House, the prime minister&apos;s offices. It had earlier been speculated that some kind of an understanding was being brokered to allow the protests to pause for King Bhumibol Adulyadej&apos;s birthday on Thursday. The king, who turns 86, is highly revered by all Thais and is seen as the sole uniting figure in the country. After breaching the barriers on the road, protesters milled outside the gates of the prime minister&apos;s office. Many took pictures of themselves. &quot;This is a victory for the protesters,&quot; said Kusol Promualrat, wearing a military camouflage green jacket in front of the gate. The man leading the demonstrations, Suthep Thaugsuban, 64, a former opposition lawmaker, had earlier issued Yingluck an ultimatum to &quot;return power to the people&quot; by Tuesday. He and his Civil Movement for Democracy (CMD) aim to overthrow the democratically elected government and install a so-called &quot;people&apos;s council&quot; manned by unelected representatives under the king as head of state. The CMD argues Yingluck&apos;s administration is a puppet of her brother Thaksin, the former PM who was ousted in a 2006 military coup and now lives in self-exile in Dubai and London.

Seemingly contradicting an interview she gave to the BBC last week, in which she said she would neither step down nor hold early elections, Yingluck told a press conference that &quot;the government is not trying to cling to power&quot;. &quot;I am not against either resignation or dissolution of parliament if this solution will stop the protests,&quot; she said. &quot;If there&apos;s anything I can do to bring peace back to the Thai people I am happy to do it. The government is more than willing to have talks but I myself cannot see a way out of this problem that is within the law and in the constitution.&quot; Protesters had said they were unwilling to negotiate and would only back down once the &quot;Thaksin regime&quot; was fully overthrown. In a televised address on Monday night Suthep vowed to fight as long as need be, even alone, until Yingluck had been removed from office. &quot;They can always come back to suck the blood of people, steal from people, disrespect the constitution and make us their slaves,&quot; he said in an apparent reference to the Shinawatra family.

At least four people have been killed and over 200 injured since. On Monday much of the violence had centred around Government House, the seat of the prime minister&apos;s offices, and police headquarters. Protesters threw rocks, bottles and homemade explosives at police in riot gear, who retaliated with water cannons and rubber bullets, and faced a standoff after protesters used rubbish trucks and bulldozers to try to overrun barriers. Doctors at a Bangkok hospital confirmed on Monday that two patients had been treated for gunshot wounds from live rounds, although it was not clear who the gunmen were. Thai police insist they are only using rubber bullets, and Yingluck&apos;s government has taken great pains to use as little force against protestors as possible. Although Suthep has claimed that the military is on his side, Yingluck told the nation that the military was acting neutrally and &quot;wants to see a peaceful way out&quot;. &quot;I believe that no one wants to see a repeat of history, where we saw people suffer and lose their lives,&quot; she said.

It began with protests last month against a proposed blanket amnesty that would have exonerated former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was forced out by a military coup in 2006 and later found guilty of corruption. The government, led by the current prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra \u2013 Thaksin&apos;s sister, has stood its ground and time is running out for the protesters. The tense standoff appears to be losing steam as King Bhumibol Adulyadej&apos;s 86th birthday on 5 December is already being celebrated. Yet the latest round of brinkmanship is unlikely to be the last, as Thailand tries to find a new balance between competing sources of elected and unelected political legitimacy. This crisis is reminiscent of five years ago when anti-Thaksin demonstrators protested against Thaksin&apos;s proxy government, culminating in the takeover of Bangkok&apos;s main international airport, and the constitution court&apos;s dissolution of the ruling party. The controversy allowed the opposition Democrat party to take power. Then, after two-and-a-half years, Thaksin&apos;s Pheu Thai party, under Yingluck, reclaimed the electoral mandate, in 2011. Once again, anti-government protesters want to end &quot;the Thaksin regime&quot; by occupying government agencies in the capital. Their leader, Suthep Thuagsuban, a veteran Democrat party MP who resigned to spearhead the protests, has publicly indicated that the protesters&apos; goal is to replace Yingluck with a &quot;people&apos;s government&quot; and to elevate the role of the monarchy in Thailand&apos;s electoral democracy. The protesters are fed up with the electoral system and the money politics that lubricates and underpins Thai democracy. Exemplified by Thaksin, unscrupulous politicians buy their way to success at the polls and then recoup their &quot;electoral investments&quot; with a hefty profit from corruption when in office. Suthep&apos;s supporters, comprising roughly two-fifths of the active electorate, want to abandon electoral democracy in favour of unelected figures of integrity and moral authority. They have been calling for &quot;good people&quot; to run Thailand&apos;s government and chart its future direction. Thailand is going through a critical test of its electoral democracy, of how to have sufficient checks for an acceptable balance. While the electoral side of the Thai divide enjoys popular legitimacy and international credibility, the non-elected side emphasises integrity, morality and a sense of noblesse oblige. An elected politician who can move Thailand forward in spite of corruption \u2013 which is seen as common and unavoidable \u2013 is the preference of the Thaksin-Yingluck supporters. An unelected and incorruptible technocrat with policy expertise working tirelessly for the common good is the ideal leader for the anti-government protesters on Bangkok&apos;s streets. In the future, the forces of elected power will have to show more integrity and policymaking skill. They will need to bolster the trust of voters and avoid abuses of power. The forces of appointed and unelected authority will have to come up with electoral legitimacy and policy delivery to cater to the vast majority of the electorate. They need to at least have a chance at triumphing at the polls. This means Thaksin-Yingluck&apos;s Pheu Thai party will have to be more attentive to the grievances of the electoral minority, whereas the opposition Democrat party will need a complete overhaul of its leadership and policy ideas to have a chance of winning after a 20-year hiatus. And third, fourth and smaller parties will need to be promoted to bring a more level electoral playing field. Thailand&apos;s latest bout of political crisis is a major improvement on recent years. The military has not intervened, the airport is unlikely to be shut again, and the judiciary has not disbanded a ruling party. These are the positive signs emerging from Thailand&apos;s democratic learning curve. Thailand must build on this progress as it grapples with the right mix of elected sources of power and unelected centres of moral authority.", "publicationDate": "2013-12-02T18:29:17Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Thaksin Shinawatra", "Protest", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/thailand-great-political-divide", "title": "Thailand's great political divide | Thitinan Pongsudhirak", "sentences": ["This crisis is reminiscent of five years ago when anti-Thaksin demonstrators protested against Thaksin&apos;s proxy government, culminating in the takeover of Bangkok&apos;s main international airport, and the constitution court&apos;s dissolution of the ruling party.", "An unelected and incorruptible technocrat with policy expertise working tirelessly for the common good is the ideal leader for the anti-government protesters on Bangkok&apos;s streets."]}, {"article": "6.00amMy alarm goes off. Our house overlooks a rice paddy field and the sun rises at about 6.15am. There are several cranes knee deep in the water and the last remaining frogs and crickets are just swapping their night shifts with the sound of the morning song. It is a beautiful start to the day. 6.20amI gently coerce my two-and-half-year-old son, Fabien, out of bed while his daddy makes him some toast and jam \u2013 there&apos;s no Asian breakfasts in our house just yet. From the shower, I can hear them both discussing the day ahead. These are indeed precious moments which in the UK neither of us had time to stop and count. Daddy works from home and is on hand to collect Fabien from school most days. 6.55amIt&apos;s rainy season so there&apos;s no chance of walking or cycling to school today because our village is flooded. We take a taxi to school \u2013 the drive is only about 10 minutes. We are on the edge of Bangkok, skyscrapers seen in the distance contrast with a small herd of buffalo chewing the cud on the banks of the klong. 7.10amWe both take Fabien into school \u2013 his classroom nanny and teaching assistant look after him until his day starts at 8am. We say our goodbyes and I head to my classroom. I log on to see emails and headlines from the UK \u2013 it&apos;s always a sobering reminder of why we left. 7.45amThe whole school attend a ceremonial raising of the Thai national flag and sing the national anthem before registration. This happens all over Thailand twice per day \u2013 I&apos;m always impressed by the respect it commands from citizens who stand still and to attention. 8.00amA quick meeting with the headmaster. The school is very keen on cross-phase collaboration and we talk about how the English department can help develop literacy in primary and especially how we can incorporate technology. The conversation is inspiring and I am afforded much more freedom than I would be in the UK. 9.00amYear 13 language A-level. The students are preparing a TED style talk on linguistics. Their first attempts are good and we plan to film them and upload them onto YouTube. 10.00amPlanning, preparation and assessment is my favourite time; I have 10 hours a week which I divide between marking and preparing resources. I also allow myself time to peruse the education news. Our school is very keen on social networking and using technology to teach so I&apos;m often distracted by a Twitter feed or a Wordpress blog which then inspires a lesson or a new way of teaching something. I enjoy the freedom from regulation and rules that UK schools impose. 11.20amIt&apos;s &quot;fun Friday&quot; with my year seven so we usually play a series of word games. All my students are all English as an additional language (EAL) learners and it&apos;s a chance for them to show how much new vocabulary they have taken on board. We play &quot;spell it right&quot;, where two teams compete to write spellings on the board. The first to finish wins, but points are deducted for each misspelling. Every week they are challenged to create a new game or find one we haven&apos;t played before. 12.20pmLunch time. We are served a mixture of Thai and western food. Today it&apos;s green curry with chicken; the amount of chilli varies from week to week so it is always a pleasant surprise when I can actually eat it. The school canteen makes fresh Thai food daily; there are three courses with two options for the main meals. The emulating smells are divine. My UK colleagues and I often discuss the differences between the pupils here and back home, they are so different in everything. It is easy to become complacent. 2.00pmThe whole school are off timetable to sell cakes in a charity bake sale. This year we are supporting children with disabilities, which is still an area of taboo in rural Thailand and lots of the children are abandoned for bringing shame on their families. We are a British-style school so we address issues like equality through PSHE and fundraising events. The pupils all compete in houses to raise money, and while the cakes range from homemade to shop bought, every pupil participates and the event is a great success. 3.15pmA quick check of my emails and a desk tidy before I grab my bag and head over to early years to collect Fabien. My husband is waiting for us by the school gate; we&apos;re off to Ko Samet for the weekend. It&apos;s an hour&apos;s taxi and then a 20 minute boat ride. By 6pm, we are on the beach watching an epic sunset, drinking a beer. We shall be here for three to four days as next week is half term. No plans, just going with the flow.

The largely tactical move was seen as an attempt to defuse political tensions ahead of King Bhumibol Adulyadej&apos;s 86th birthday on Thursday. But protest leaders said the peace was only temporary, and that fighting would carry on &quot;as long as it takes&quot; until the prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, and her government are ousted from power. After a night of fighting between demonstrators and police in which rubbish trucks and bulldozers were rammed into barriers and fireworks and rockets were fired at officers, the mood in the capital on Tuesday had turned to jubilant. Police stood down and dismantled barriers and razor wire, allowing protesters to wander freely among previously secured buildings and to snack on the lawn of the prime minister&apos;s offices. Policemen handed out red roses, posed for photos and sang love songs on ukuleles, while others snoozed in the shade. &quot;We&apos;re done here,&quot; one policeman said with a smile. &quot;We&apos;re going home.&quot; But Suthep Thaugsuban, the organiser behind the protests that have rocked Bangkok for more than a week, said this was only a &quot;partial victory&quot;. &quot;You cannot go back home yet,&quot; he told protesters at a rally. &quot;We must continue our struggle.&quot; Suthep, along with his Civil Movement for Democracy, aims to remove Yingluck&apos;s democratically elected government and install a &quot;people&apos;s council&quot; of unelected representatives, with the king \u2013 seen as the single unifying force in the country \u2013 serving as head of state. Protesters view Yingluck as a puppet of her brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, the former PM who was ousted in 2006 in a military coup. He now lives in Dubai in self-imposed exile to avoid a corruption conviction that he claims is politically motivated. Angered by an amnesty bill that would have allowed Thaksin to return and quashed his corruption conviction, protesters rallied in their thousands to call for an end to the &quot;Thaksin regime&quot;, although their numbers have dwindled as the days have worn on. Suthep, a former lawmaker in the opposition Democrat party who served as deputy premier in the last government, has plans for further rallies on Wednesday and said full demonstrations would resume after the king&apos;s birthday, only ending &quot;when we reach our goals&quot;. &quot;This isn&apos;t about political parties, it&apos;s about the people,&quot; he said. &quot;The ultimate goal is to rid the Thaksin regime completely from Thailand.&quot; Yingluck has offered to negotiate several times. On Tuesday she said she hoped all sides would come together for talks. However, Suthep has said his movement will not stand for any negotiation. Nor will it abide by a dissolution of parliament, any form of coalition, or a new appointment for prime minister vetted by Yingluck and approved by the protesters. He said he had clear reasons for an unelected people&apos;s council formed of &quot;good people&quot;. &quot;From a western point of view, &apos;democracy&apos; is an elected government serving as the people&apos;s representative. Unfortunately, elections in Thailand do not represent people&apos;s [real] choices because their votes are bought.&quot; It is unclear just what will happen next, with rumours circling of army involvement in the crisis, and many looking to a speech by the king on Wednesday for any insinuation of political unity or strategy. Analysts warn Suthep&apos;s refusal to negotiate could spell disaster for Thailand&apos;s fragile democracy, putting it at potential risk of total upheaval. &quot;If he succeeds in his plans [to oust Yingluck], we will see huge turmoil in Thailand,&quot; said political scientist Thitinan Pongsudhirak of the Thai Institute of Security and International Studies. &quot;When he refers to &apos;the people&apos;, he is not talking about the 67 million people in Thailand or the eligible voters among\u00a0them. &quot;He&apos;s talking about a lot of people in Bangkok, and some in the south; so this is a big problem.

That is why it is worrying that even as they ordered the dismantling of barricades that had been keeping protesters at bay, Bangkok has demanded that the leader of the demonstrators should give himself up to face charges of insurrection. He himself has issued ultimatums of his own. One moment we have police and protesters cheerfully mingling and exchanging flowers, the next we have ultimatums that could reignite the confrontations that have already taken several lives and brought normal government business to a standstill. Which way events turn will not be clear, probably until after the celebrations today of the 86th birthday of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, during which both sides are expected to show respect by keeping their activities to a minimum. Whatever then happens, the deeper problems that have brought many thousands on to the streets of the capital in the last two weeks will not easily go away. The struggle between supporters and opponents of Thaksin Shinawatra, the former prime minister who continues to shape the political scene from afar, reflect a sharp division in society between two rival middle classes. Thaksin empowered and enriched rural areas, particularly the north-east. The poor people of these remoter parts had never been absent from politics, but their grievances and aspirations were mediated through the person of the monarch, seen as their protector and, in effect, their representative at the centre. Now they are better off, better educated and in power, in the sense that the Pheu Thai party, successor to Thaksin&apos;s Thai Rak Thai party and led by his sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, is in charge in Bangkok. The older middle class of Bangkok and the south, mainly represented by the Democratic party, has a strong sense that it has been unfairly displaced and that the numbers of votes the government can muster are a product of electoral bribery, although that is hardly a new phenomenon in Thailand. There is also a feeling that the special role of the king has been somehow eroded. His age and health have added to the tension, as has wrangling over amnesties for Thaksin and others. The demands of the demonstrators, which include the replacement of the government by an ill-defined &quot;people&apos;s council&quot;, could not be called democratic and, indeed, seem to be based on the idea that a purely arithmetical democracy has delivered the wrong result. Yet the emergence of new political forces in Thailand should be good news, giving it the basis over the longer term for a reliable alternation in power by two major parties.

Yet you always wind up making movies about men. Yes. Violent men. But I guess they&apos;re very feminine in a way. Yet this one is about castration ...  It&apos;s about how through a sexual fantasy comes the need to castrate oneself to free oneself of the womb. Ish. Do you have dreams about castration? Or giving birth? No, no. But I remember when my first child was born, my wife had a speed birth. She&apos;d been in labour for eight hours and suddenly it was going to happen. It was so surreal because I realised I was no longer of any use emotionally or physically. The ambulance came and we didn&apos;t even make it to the delivery room, it was the waiting room. It was night. Just about to become dawn, dawn of man. Only fluorescent lights from the ceiling. It was out of body, it was like: now you understand the creation of life. Afterwards, the midwife said to me: &quot;You wanna see something?&quot; I said: &quot;I think I&apos;ve seen enough to last a lifetime.&quot; And she took the afterbirth, which was lying on the table \u2013 and it&apos;s not a particularly beautiful sight \u2013 and she held it up, gently, to the fluorescent light and then it&apos;s very transparent. All these veins. And she said: &quot;Do you know what we call this in the world of midwives?&quot; And I said: &quot;I&apos;ve no idea.&quot; She said: &quot;This is what we call the tree of life.&quot; That cemented my belief that women are of a more advanced race than men. And has the Barbie corporation seen Only God Forgives? (3)  They haven&apos;t been in contact. They haven&apos;t asked me to make my own line. Though I&apos;d love that. (4) I love the details. I collect Asian toys, mostly. I love the different worlds like Sylvanian Families. I like things that are cute and fuzzy. Why? I think it reminds me of kindness.

But the leader of the protests, Suthep Thaugsuban \u2013 a deputy premier in the previous administration \u2013 vowed that the fight would only end once the current &quot;regime&quot; was &quot;eradicated&quot; from Thailand, and told his supporters to prepare for another round of fighting on Friday. The two sides had observed a two-day truce, beginning on Wednesday, out of respect for King Bhumibol Adulyadej&apos;s 86th birthday. On Thursday the ailing monarch told a sea of yellow-clad onlookers, the colour of the monarchy: &quot;Thailand has been peaceful for a long time because we are united and have worked together. Every Thai person should be aware of this and perform their role for the benefit of the country, which is the stability and security of the country.&quot; The gold-robed monarch, the longest reigning in the world, left hospital in August after a four-year stay, the result of various ailments, and spoke from the royal Klai Kanwon palace in Hua Hin, three hours south of Bangkok, where many yellow-shirted supporters had slept overnight \u2013 some on the streets \u2013 to celebrate his birthday with candlelit ceremonies and fireworks. Although he has no official legal powers, Bhumibol is seen as the single unifying force in this nation of 67 million, with his pictures adorning many homes and shops and his birthday celebrated as both a national holiday and Father&apos;s Day. The king has previously stepped in during political deadlocks to ease tensions and many looked to his speech for clues on what direction, if any, the current deadlock might take now. But the short five-minute speech failed to address the current deadlock head on. Suthep vowed to resume demonstrations until the embattled administration of Yingluck Shinawatra had been replaced by an unelected &quot;people&apos;s council&quot;. &quot;Today is a day that Thai people, nationwide, believe is an auspicious day,&quot; Suthep said from protest headquarters, the seized government complex in north Bangkok. Protests led by Suthep over the past fortnight were instigated by an ill-conceived amnesty bill that would have allowed for the return of Yingluck&apos;s brother Thaksin, a divisive former PM who currently lives abroad in self-imposed exile to avoid a corruption conviction. Suthep considers the government to be part of a corrupt &quot;Thaksin regime&quot; that must be replaced with a royally appointed prime minister and cabinet, part of which would be manned by &quot;good people&quot; chosen from representatives of all segments of society. Critics have called Suthep&apos;s council utopian and absurd. Analysts have warned, however, that the protest leader&apos;s plans \u2013 should they be abetted by any help from the military, judiciary or palace, which have stepped in in the past \u2013 could lead to civil war, with thousands of pro-Thaksin &quot;red shirts&quot; protesting against the so-called people&apos;s council, potentially leading to great bloodshed. Political scientist Thitinan Pongsudhirak, of Thailand&apos;s Institute of Security and International Studies (ISIS), said the 64-year-old protest leader would be likely to forge ahead anyway, interpreting the king&apos;s speech for his own benefit. &quot;If Suthep maintains and intensifies his people&apos;s revolt, he would have taken the king&apos;s speech as the absence of a red light \u2013 unlike a similar speech in 2006, when the king chastised anti-government protesters for asking for an appointed government.&quot; The leader of the red-shirt United Front of Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), Jatupon Prompan, said a massive demonstration was already planned for Tuesday in Ayutthaya, roughly 55 miles from Bangkok, with roughly 10,000 red shirts expected to attend. &quot;We will never give this land up to Suthep,&quot; Jatupon said.", "publicationDate": "2013-12-05T18:30:05Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Thaksin Shinawatra", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/05/thailand-king-bhumibol-appeal-people", "title": "Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej appeals to people to stand united", "sentences": ["Every Thai person should be aware of this and perform their role for the benefit of the country, which is the stability and security of the country.&quot; The gold-robed monarch, the longest reigning in the world, left hospital in August after a four-year stay, the result of various ailments, and spoke from the royal Klai Kanwon palace in Hua Hin, three hours south of Bangkok, where many yellow-shirted supporters had slept overnight \u2013 some on the streets \u2013 to celebrate his birthday with candlelit ceremonies and fireworks.", "&quot;Today is a day that Thai people, nationwide, believe is an auspicious day,&quot; Suthep said from protest headquarters, the seized government complex in north Bangkok.", "&quot;If Suthep maintains and intensifies his people&apos;s revolt, he would have taken the king&apos;s speech as the absence of a red light \u2013 unlike a similar speech in 2006, when the king chastised anti-government protesters for asking for an appointed government.&quot; The leader of the red-shirt United Front of Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), Jatupon Prompan, said a massive demonstration was already planned for Tuesday in Ayutthaya, roughly 55 miles from Bangkok, with roughly 10,000 red shirts expected to attend."]}, {"article": "Thanks for all your comments and suggestions on our last blog. 1) Two years, one day at a time Niall McNamee made his last bet two years ago. He was not in a good place: &quot;I have no idea what horse I backed or where it ran but what I do know is that it lost. It had got to a stage that I was no longer able to leave a bookies unless all of my money was gone or the nice lady behind the counter was turning off the TV because they were closing. If I was &apos;lucky&apos; enough to have left with some money in my pocket it didn&apos;t matter, I knew I would be back the next day to give it all back. That night, the following morning, my entire day in work, my head would be consumed with thoughts of doubling, trebling, quadrupling my winnings from the day before. Whatever debts or troubles I had would be wiped out if I could just have that one big win to get me back on track.&quot; He was convinced that gambling would be his saviour, but the more he bet, the more he lost. He sold his car for half its value to place another failed bet; he sneaked food out of his mother&apos;s kitchen as he couldn&apos;t afford to buy his own; he gambled away the majority of his wages for five years. And then he stopped. This is the the story of how he hit the bottom and then began to recover. It&apos;s worth a read. 2) Soccer and logic don&apos;t often mix Yael Averbuch starts this New York Times article with a promise: &quot;In 500 words, I&apos;m about to logically explain why I do not subscribe to logic.&quot;  Aristotle, Plato and friends can rest easily, as she doesn&apos;t quite succeed in bringing down 2,500 or so years of western thought; but as she opens up about her life as a professional footballer in the women&apos;s game, it becomes clear that chasing a dream can lead to compromises: &quot;I&apos;m laying in the same bed in my parents&apos; house in which I slept as a 9-year-old. I&apos;m 27. No home of my own home; I have a job that is incredibly unstable; and I get paid to play a game. I am on a continual mission to find fulfillment from a journey with no destination. None of this is logical, yet all of this is right.&quot; Good luck to her.\u00a0 3) Mount Leinster Rangers v Oulart-the-Ballagh Skip to 16.10 and savour the joy of local radio. Mount Leinster Rangers have just become the first Carlow club to be crowned Leinster senior hurling champions, much to the delight of the commentator. &quot;I told everybody, I told everybody&quot;, he exclaims. &quot;They&apos;ll love this one \u2013 from Ballymurphy to Bangkok and from Rahara to Rhodesia.&quot;  The elation soon turns to score-settling as he shames the &quot;begrudgers&quot; for underestimating the Mount Leinster Rangers. Partiality has rarely sounded so good.      4) How books about sport got serious Simon Kuper makes an interesting point in his column for the Financial Times: &quot;American writers have always taken sports seriously. Ernest Hemingway, Damon Runyon, Ring Lardner, Norman Mailer and Jack Kerouac all worked as sports journalists.&quot;  America has a great tradition of paying serious writers handsome sums to produce quality journalism. Europe has always lagged behind in this regard \u2013 can you think of one British newspaper that would devote more than three pages to a single piece of longform sportswriting? \u2013\u00a0but Kuper believes that things are changing for the better.  The phrase &quot;football book&quot; stopped being considered an oxymoron in the early 1990s when Pete Davies&apos; All Played Out (1990) and then Nick Hornby&apos;s Fever Pitch (1992) opened the eyes of publishers to the potential of sports books. Two decades later and there are now admirable football publications in Sweden (Offside), Norway (Josimar), Spain (Panenka) and the US (Howler).  With every match available to watch online, and with footballers now masters of the art of saying nothing, the days of match reports, interviews and previews could be ending. But the lure of longform writing seems to be growing.  5) Review of 2013 football     Everton's Marouane Fellaini thanks God for his luck. Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA    ESPN have jumped the gun a little with this review of the year, but the quote of the month section picks out a few pearlers. Apparently, when speaking back in January about his life in Liverpool, Marouane Fellaini said: &quot;I was recognised too much and sometimes women would suddenly climb all over me.&quot; 6) The history of Filipino football The Philippines football team played their first international match 100 years ago. They beat China 2-1 in Manila on 4 February 1913 in what was to prove a golden age for the young team. Their 15-2 thumping of Japan four years later is still their biggest victory.  Paulino Alc\u00e1ntara was the man of the match that day. When the young striker&apos;s family moved back to Spain, he signed for Barcelona. He went on to score a 357 goals for the club \u2013 a record Lionel Messi could break in the next few years. Alc\u00e1ntara also managed and played for Spain (scoring five goals in six games). Filipino football has quite a history, as Terry Cornick explains in this feature for These Football Times.  7) 15 classic traits of sports fans who grew up in the 1980s If you see Paul McGrath as a Manchester United player, miss the glory days of snooker and think Michael Thomas&apos;s title-wimnning goal was more dramatic than Sergio Aguero&apos;s, this article by Conor Neville for Balls.ie is one for you. 8) Children of the ring Muay Thai boxers learn their craft early. Across Thailand the 700-year-old sport is taught to seven-year-old boys and girls, who are expected to perform in the ring with no protective headgear.

Once Upon a Time in China  The film that kick-started Hong Kong cinema&apos;s kung-fu renaissance and launched Jet Li towards a future of substandard western action movies. Its subject was already well known to local audiences: Wong Fei-hung was a real person: a turn-of-the-century martial arts master and healer who&apos;s become something of a folk hero. Like Sherlock Holmes or Robin Hood, he&apos;d been portrayed many times before. Jackie Chan played him in Drunken Master, and a long-running Wong Fei-hung film series during the 1950s and 60s gave roles to the fathers of Bruce Lee and Yuen Wo-ping, among many others. Transposed to 1990s Hong Kong, with the handover from British to Chinese sovereignty on the horizon, this story of a Chinese rebel fighting oppressive colonialist powers had extra resonance. Its British and American baddies are cartoonishly demonised, and the plot is often convoluted to the point of impenetrability, admittedly, but what this film chiefly provides is dazzling, colourful, kinetic, epic, pre-CGI spectacle. Director Tsui Hark, schooled in both the US and Hong Kong, fills the screen with movement and energy. The wire-assisted fight scenes \u2013 choreographed by Yuen Wo-ping, inevitably \u2013 are ingeniously staged. Earthbound reality is left far behind. And Li is simply incredible. He&apos;s got gravitas as an actor, but when he&apos;s in action, he really takes some beating. He does it all: fighting with hands, feet, sticks, poles, umbrellas. He kills one baddie with a bullet \u2013 without using a gun. But Li is a gymnast, too, pirouetting and somersaulting across the screen with the agility of a cat. He&apos;s surely the most graceful martial artist out there. Those skills come to bear in a jubilantly athletic final duel, which takes place in a warehouse conveniently full of bamboo ladders. It&apos;s one of the most celebrated sequences in martial arts movies, and it leaves you wanting more, of which there is plenty: they made four sequels in the next two years. Steve Rose 9. Yojimibo     Yojimbo film still Photograph: Ronald Grant Archive    Akira Kurosawa drew upon American pulp sources for Yojimbo&apos;s plot, principally the Hollywood western but also Dashiell Hammett&apos;s broken-city melodrama The Dain Curse. Here a lone, probably disgraced, certainly hungry samurai (Toshiro Mifune, the Wolf to Kurosawa&apos;s Emperor) wanders into a town where two factions are in eternal conflict, glaring at one another from their matching headquarters on opposite sides of the town&apos;s wide, western-like main street. Since each faction lacks a distinguished warrior with whose aid they might tip the balance of power in their favour, they each badly want the newcomer on their side, something the samurai figures out within moments, and exploits throughout the movie.  As the power games play out to their nihilistic, corpse-choked conclusion, Kurosawa demonstrates a mastery of his medium in almost every frame. His sense of spatial relations is beyond compare: panels in interior walls slide away to reveal whole exterior street-scapes and crowd scenes perfectly framed within the smaller new frame. Intimate conversations take place as a turbulent skirmish rages in the deep background center-screen, between the talkers&apos; faces in the foreground. And what faces! From the moronic warrior with the M-shaped unibrow and the giant wielding a huge mallet to Mifune&apos;s increasingly battered countenance, sardonic, cynical and ever defiant, every single face is at once a landscape and an epic poem unto itself.  Along with all that comes Kurosawa&apos;s furious visual energy, his virtuoso choreography of moving camera and bodies of warring men; and his talent for adding enriching layers of kinetic, elemental motion \u2013 rain falling, leaves or smoke blowing in the unceasing winds \u2013 to the violence already in play. Yojimbo led to the Italian A Fistful of Dollars, which in time completely remade the American western, completing a circle of international cultural exchange that foreshadows a give-and-take among international filmmakers that we take for granted today. John Patterson 8. A Touch of Zen     A1B5WP A Touch Of Zen Hsia Nu Year 1972 Director King Hu martial arts Adventures jump combat Cinema Photograph: Alamy    We have A Touch of Zen to thank for Harvey Weinstein&apos;s interest in Asian cinema; it was after Quentin Tarantino screened King Hu&apos;s 1971 wuxia that the mogul began a controversial spending spree in the east that led to his current controversial involvement with Bong Joon-ho&apos;s Snowpiercer. It&apos;s not hard to see why: Hu&apos;s film is unusually epic for the genre, clocking in at over three hours, and made cinema history by being the first Chinese film to win an award at Cannes, missing out on the Palme d&apos;Or but taking home the Technical prize. A Touch of Zen is most notable nowadays as the template for Ang Lee&apos;s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, being the 14th century story of an artist, Ku, who encounters a beautiful woman living in a rundown house with her elderly mother. In true wuxia fashion, however, she is not all she seems, and so the story grows, until Ku realises that he is in the middle of a major dynastic war between rival factions. And as the story develops \u2013 effortlessly absorbing elements of comedy and romance \u2013 so does the spectacle, increasing in scale and scope in ways that would be unimaginable today. It is these fight sequences that have endured, and although wuxia briefly fell out of favour soon after, it is easy to see Hu&apos;s influence on the hit martial arts films of recent years. More so than Crouching Tiger, A Touch of Zen casts a long shadow over the films of Chinese director Zhang Yimou, whose House Of Flying Daggers directly references Hu&apos;s film in its bravura bamboo forest sequence. But it is Hu&apos;s deadpan sense of the grand that keeps this astonishing film fresh, with its themes of justice and nobility, shot through with a strange spirituality that earns the film its title in a sequence involving a pack of bouncing, kick-ass Buddhist monks. Damon Wise 7. The Raid     The Raid. Photograph: Rex    As a breathless and brutal martial arts thriller shot in Jakarta and directed by a Welshman, The Raid would already have been worthy of note. That it is a film of precision and inventiveness, taking fight sequences into the realm of horror, slapstick comedy, even the musical, guarantees its place in action-movie history. The plot is as simple as its choreography is complicated. A police unit sets out one morning to seize control of a tower block in Jakarta that has fallen into the hands of a gang. But not just any gang: this mob has kitted out the high rise with sophisticated CCTV and public address systems monitored from a top-floor control room. The gang-lord, presiding over the CCTV screens, broadcasts a call to his tenants: &quot;We have company. You know what to do.&quot; He doesn&apos;t mean put the kettle on and crack open the custard creams. In the absence of much dialogue, the weapons do the talking: guns, knives, swords, hammers. A man receives an axe to the shoulder, which is then used to yank him across the room. A refrigerator doubles as a bomb. The gang&apos;s most vicious member, Mad Dog (Yayan Ruhian, who also served as one of the film&apos;s fight choreographers), acts as mouthpiece for the film&apos;s philosophy. Casting aside his firearms, he explains: &quot;Using a gun is like ordering takeout.&quot; If that&apos;s the case, Mad Dog would merit a fistful of Michelin stars. Some of the fight sequences are enclosed claustrophobically in hallways where the only option is to use walls as springboards, Donald O&apos;Connor-style. Others, such as a dust-up in a drugs lab, expand like dance numbers. Evans&apos;s prime achievement has been to make a berserk adventure characterised by clarity. In contrast to most action cinema, the frenzy arises from the performers rather than the editing; no matter how frenzied things get, we never lose sight of who is karate-chopping the windpipe of whom. Ryan Gilbey 6. Ong-Bak     Tony Jaa in a still from the film Ong Bak, no further info    Hands and feet are one thing in martial arts; elbows and knees are quite another. And after seeing this Muay Thai showreel, you&apos;d put money on Tony Jaa against any other screen fighter. Even in the scenes where Jaa isn&apos;t fighting anyone at all, simply going through some moves, he&apos;s awesomely formidable. Ong Bak as a movie is fairly straightforward: city baddies steal a village&apos;s Buddha head; a humble peasant goes to get it back, individually crushing each adversary with his bare hands in the process. That&apos;s all it needs. Ong Bak&apos;s prime objective is to say, &quot;Can you believe this guy?&quot; and with the added note that no special effects or stunt doubles were used, it more than accomplishes it. In fight after fight, Jaa unleashes moves that leave you thinking, &quot;That&apos;s gotta hurt&quot;, if not &quot;That&apos;s gonna require major cranial reconstruction&quot;. No holds are barred and few punches are pulled, but rather than brute violence, you&apos;re left marvelling at Jaa&apos;s speed, technique and pain threshold. The fights are skilfully staged, particularly an exhilarating, three-round barroom brawl that leaves no opponent or piece of furniture standing. Jaa shows off his physical prowess in other ways, too, from an opening tree-climbing race to a Bangkok street chase that sends him along a hilarious assault course of cafe tables, market stalls, children, cars, trucks, sheets of glass and hoops of barbed wire. He&apos;s almost too much to believe, and Ong Bak acknowledges our incredulity by frequently rewinding the action to show us Jaa&apos;s moves in slow motion, as if to say, &quot;Do you want to see that again?&quot;. We do. SR 5. The Matrix     Blurring appearance and reality ... Keanu Reeves and Hugo Weaving in The Matrix. Photograph: Rex Features    Cocteau imagined the mirror as a gateway to another world in his 1930 film The Blood of a Poet, and it&apos;s a testament to the durability of this image that when it turned up again in The Matrix, it had lost none of its allure. The film clocks up a further debt in its plot, which proposes that what we perceive as reality is actually a cosmetic facade constructed to conceal a terrible truth about our existence. Neo, a computer boffin played by Keanu Reeves, is selected to bear the burden of enlightenment. Reeves&apos;s blankness in the part is perfect, mainly because Neo is required to display only those skills and qualities that are downloaded into his brain. Required to master jujitsu, he is simply installed with the relevant computer programme. In no time at all, he is pulling off those tricks from 1970s martial arts movies, where a man can launch himself in a flying kick and somehow manage to prepare a cocktail, read a short novel and fill out his tax return, all before his feet touch the ground. The film&apos;s Cocteau-esque concept is harnessed to some X-Files-style paranoia, but it is the dazzling martial arts work that gives the film its special lift. The directors, the Wachowski brothers, were already having ideas above their station when they came up with The Matrix (their only previous film, after all, was the sweaty, claustrophobic thriller Bound). It was the martial arts choreographer Yuen Woo-ping who helped them reach the next level. The movie&apos;s fight sequences provide its purest source of pleasure for a number of reasons. First, the violence doesn&apos;t come with redemptive overtones; it is played out for the thrill of the choreography, not the anticipation of injury or righteousness. Death is flippant, but it provides no moral kick. Second, the movie introduced a strange new effect, much copied or parodied since in everything from Charlie&apos;s Angels to Shrek: a character freezes in midair while the camera circles the tableau like a computer imagining a 3D representation of a 2D image. When the camera has completed its movement, the physical motion of the scene resumes. Suddenly the humdrum vocabulary of the action movie has been extended before our disbelieving eyes. RG 4. House of Flying Daggers     Zhang Yimou, who directed House of Flying Daggers, above, has directed the film version Photograph: c.Sony Pics/Everett / Rex Featur    Watch the opening 20 minutes of House of Flying Daggers and it&apos;s not hard to see why the Chinese picked its director, Zhang Yimou, to direct the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics. Even though the action unfolds within a reasonably sized brothel waiting room instead of a stadium, there&apos;s all the elements that Zhang would multiply by the thousands in 2008: traditional Chinese music, dancing, swathes of brightly coloured silk cloth, drummers and, of course, martial arts. It makes for a magnificent spectacle that&apos;s sets a high bar for the rest of the movie. Fortunately, there&apos;s more dazzle to come in this follow-up to Zhang&apos;s first wuxia film, Hero. Zhang&apos;s 2006 Curse of the Golden Flower concluded the trilogy, but for many the romantic, operatic yet satisfyingly compact Flying Daggers represents the best of the three. Set during the Tang dynasty, two police captains, Leo (Andy Lau, best known for the thematically-not-dissimilar Infernal Affairs trilogy) and Jin (hunky Takeshi Kaneshiro) are searching for the leader of the Flying Daggers, a counterinsurgency group. They suspect blind courtesan Mei (Zhang Ziyi) may be a secret member of the Daggers, so Jin, posing as a citizen, busts her out of jail and goes on the run with her, pursued by Leo and numerous expendable officers. Love seems to flower between Jin and Mei, but no one and nothing are as they seem here. Although the fights are terrifically choreographed by Tony Ching Siu-tung \u2013 especially a bamboo-forest chase that tops Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and a final mano-a-mano in the snow \u2013 judged against other classic martial arts films, Daggers is actually a little light on combat scenes. Indeed, the fighting is so stringently stylized it&apos;s more like dancing with knives. No matter: the love story may be almost as schematic as the film&apos;s rigorous use of colour, yet the acting is so powerful from the core trio that deep emotional depth is created seemingly out of nothing.

Mandatory Credit: Photo by Moviestore Collection/REX (1609199a) Police Story,  Jackie Chan Film and Television  FILM TELEVISION POLICE STORY JACKIE CHAN Film Stills Personality 12372269 Photograph: Moviestore Collection/REX    Although it was obvious at the time, it seems strange now that Jackie Chan was originally groomed by at least one Hong Kong producer as a successor to Bruce Lee, the lithe master of martial arts whose style was almost laughably serious in its grim-faced intensity. After a few tryouts in the genre, however, Chan took things in a much more comedic, but no less athletic route, which is why, after breaking out in the Yuen Woo-ping classic Drunken Master, the former stuntman found himself in Hollywood, adding light relief to The Cannonball Run in 1981. Chan&apos;s Hollywood career, however, didn&apos;t pan out, and after a disappointment in 1985 with The Protector \u2013 a collaboration with neo-grindhouse director James Glickenhaus, perhaps not the most sympatico of all possible talents \u2013 Chan returned to Hong Kong to take matters into his own hands, directing and cowriting Police Story, in which he played a disgraced cop who is forced to go undercover and clear his name after being framed by drug barons. Making a direct rebuttal of the Hollywood way of doing things (in his mind, sloppily and half-heartedly), Chan prioritised the fights and stuntwork, using the genre elements mostly as filler. Refusing to use a body double for every scene (bar one that involved a motorcycle), Chan began to earn his reputation as a fearless and pioneering action star. On this film alone, he was hospitalised with concussion, suffered severe burns, dislocated his pelvis and was almost paralysed by a shattered vertebrae. The resulting film was a huge hit and spawned five strong sequels. Seen now, it seems remarkably straight given what was to follow \u2013 the cartoonish Rush Hour series \u2013 although Chan certainly must have enjoyed the irony of being embraced by Hollywood for a film that is, essentially, a critique of everything it was doing wrong.

Perhaps because every bone in your body tells you it shouldn&apos;t work. It&apos;s a tranquil action movie. Whoever heard of one of those? And it&apos;s a love story with a kick: a kung-fu kick. It begins with the theft of a fabled sword, the Green Destiny. As the sword is stolen, the camera takes flight along with the thief, for whom gravity is a restricting garment to be cast off at a moment&apos;s notice. The warrior Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) gives chase, skipping blithely across rooftops that glow silver in the moonlight. When the pursuit gives way to combat, the rule book of action cinema is not only discarded but sliced to ribbons. For viewers too young to remember, the shock of seeing a Sam Peckinpah shoot-out back when slow motion was an innovation rather than a nasty virus, then the sight of these warriors levitating calmly to nosebleed-inducing heights will provide something of that same liberating jolt.  The midair skirmishes of martial arts movies were brought to mainstream audiences by The Matrix, and Lee enlisted that film&apos;s choreographer, Yuen Woo-ping (who later worked on Kill Bill and Kung Fu Hustle), to take that style even further. The resulting fight routines evoke Olympic gymnastics, break dancing and those cartoon punch-ups where one of the Tasmanian Devil&apos;s limbs would emerge briefly from within a frantic cyclone. And if Yu occasionally steps on her opponent&apos;s foot, she&apos;s not fighting dirty \u2013 it&apos;s just the only way of ensuring that the battle remains at ground level. For all the finesse of the choreography, the action sequences would be superficial without the emotional weight Lee brings to the picture, notably in the largely unspoken tenderness between Yu and her fellow warrior Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat). As a director he doesn&apos;t differentiate between the way he shoots tenderness and violence. In his hands, a love scene can come to be brutal, with a man&apos;s blood forming a fork across his lover&apos;s breast as they embrace, while a struggle between opponents in the forest treetops, with the supple branches doubling as nests, catapults, rungs and bungee ropes, achieves a sensuous serenity. RG 1. Enter the Dragon     Enter the Dragon, with Bruce Lee.    Bruce Lee purists may or may not agree that Enter the Dragon is his greatest film. But this is the one that has passed into legend: it was the colossal box office smash of 1973 and the most famous film of that unrivalled martial arts superstar who had died the summer before its release of a cerebral reaction to painkillers. He shared with James Dean the grim distinction of appearing posthumously in his most famous picture. After a career as a child star in Hong Kong cinema \u2013 almost the Macaulay Culkin of his day \u2013 and a spell on TV&apos;s The Green Hornet, Lee exploded into action pictures that were simply so popular and profitable that Warner Brothers agreed to make Enter the Dragon, with Lee as star and coproducer: Hollywood&apos;s first martial arts movie. Robert Clouse directed, and the script was by Michael Allin, who wrote the Isaac Hayes film Truck Turner. Lalo Schifrin composed the music. Bruce Lee was possessed of extraordinary physical grace, balletic poise, lethal speed and explosive power. He was a master of kung fu, judo and karate, and is considered the spiritual godfather to today&apos;s mixed martial arts scene. He was not a big man, and so his presence was better captured by the camera lens. Moreover, he had a delicately handsome, almost boyish face and had a charm and verbal fluency as he expounded his Zen theories of combat in interviews, something more like dynamic motivational philosophy than any fortune-cookie clich\u00e9. Lee had a presence and charisma comparable to Muhammad Ali, and that was perhaps never better captured than in Enter the Dragon. Perhaps only Jackie Chan now rivals him as an Asian star in Hollywood \u2013 and Hollywood has not shown much interest in promoting an Asian-American A-lister since Enter the Dragon. Lee plays a Shaolin master who is recuited by British intelligence to enter a martial arts tournament undercover. This event is being run by a sinister megalomaniac called Han who is suspected of involvement in drugs and prostitution. Lee has a personal beef with Han, whose goons terrorised and attempted to rape Lee&apos;s kid sister \u2013 she committed suicide rather than submit. He shows up at the island with a couple of American fighters: Williams, played by Jim Kelly, provides some Shaft-style street cred while Roper, played by John Saxon, is a playboy type who is close to the James Bond template. In truth, of course, it is Lee himself who is the James Bond, but he is no womaniser. Bruce Lee has a monkish purity and spirituality, with a laser-like focus on exposing Han \u2013 and of course kicking ass. The look of the movie is exotic and extravagant, especially its inspired hall-of-mirrors showdown, with Lee sporting the weird, almost tribal slashes across his midriff. His strange, animal quavering cry and piercing gaze are entirely unique. But what makes Enter the Dragon outshine the rest is the serene, almost innocent idealism of Lee himself. In the opening scenes, Lee speaks humbly to the aged Abbot at his temple, coolly takes tea with the British intelligence chief Braithwaite, and interrupts their conversation to instruct a teenage boy in martial arts. When this young hothead is easily bested in combat, Lee says to him with inimitable seriousness: &quot;We need emotional content \u2013 not anger.&quot; It is the philosophy of this martial arts classic, and its unique star.

Next door, guarded by uniformed police officers with machine guns, squats the immense embassy of Saudi Arabia, a country with which the controversial PR firm&apos;s even more controversial chairman, Tim Bell, has had decades of opaque, often defence-related dealings. Beyond the embassy is the rest of Mayfair, where businesses are discreet, ethics are flexible, and rich people with reputations to upgrade are in increasingly plentiful supply. In the lobby of Bell Pottinger, there are cream leather benches for visitors. The day&apos;s newspapers hang from clips on the wall. The implication is that Bell, who has worked in PR or advertising since 1959, can get you or your company or government into them \u2013 or quietly arrange the opposite. &quot;We keep a lot of people out of the media,&quot; says James Henderson, the firm&apos;s chief executive. From the lobby, a tiny lift whisks you up to Bell&apos;s top-floor office. It is a long corner room, with a row of windows looking out over Mayfair&apos;s wine-red and bone-white rooftops. In the centre of the room is a large desk, almost in the shape of a quotation mark. Along its outer curve are a few chairs for clients. On the inner, there is an oldish computer, two telephones, two used coffee cups, a half-full ashtray and Bell himself. Lord Bell of Belgravia, who was knighted by his longstanding client and political soulmate Margaret Thatcher in 1990, is 72. But he is still working full-time, and still looks like an old-fashioned PR man from central casting: slicked-back hair, assertive tie, tailored shirt, quick smile. He talks in a half-gravelly, half-chocolatey voice, and instantly drops your first name into his quick sentences. &quot;He is an icon in the business,&quot; says Mark Borkowski, another British PR veteran and a historian of the industry. &quot;A lot of people have tried to write his obituary, but they underestimate his steely determination. He has a very powerful network, contacts all over the world. Bell Pottinger are a formidable multinational. For many, many years they have operated in the shadows, as agents of influence.&quot;     'Labour Isn't Working' campaign poster, which helped discredit the Callaghan government in the late 70s.    Bell grants interviews rarely, and then usually to rightwing newspapers, his preferred journalistic conduits. But sometimes he wants to reach a wider audience. Today, sitting back from his desk in a shaft of cigarette-fogged sunlight, he is in expansive, self-deprecating mode. &quot;The Thatcher legacy \u2013 of course I live off it to some extent,&quot; he says. &quot;What I did for her has been grossly exaggerated by some, and grossly underestimated by others.&quot; According to Mark Hollingsworth&apos;s biography of Bell, The Ultimate Spin Doctor, he advised her on everything from how to relax on television \u2013 &quot;to melt her almost frozen expression, Bell would sit behind the camera and pull faces&quot; \u2013 to how to attack Labour, including the famous &quot;Labour Isn&apos;t Working&quot; poster campaign, featuring an endless queue of the unemployed (actually Young Conservatives borrowed for the shoot), that helped discredit the Callaghan government in the late 70s \u2013 shortly before the Thatcher government sent unemployment much higher. &quot;My profound belief,&quot; Bell continues, &quot;is that a small number of words, a strong visual image, can change the way people think.&quot; At Bell Pottinger, which he co-founded in 1998, &quot;We tell stories \u2013 I don&apos;t mean lies. We work for people who want to tell their side of the story.&quot; The government of Sri Lanka; FW de Klerk, when he ran against Nelson Mandela for president of South Africa; Thaksin Shinawatra, the ousted Thai premier, whom protesters claim still controls the country; Asma al-Assad, the wife of the president of Syria; Alexander Lukashenko, the dictator of Belarus; Rebekah Brooks after the phone-hacking scandal broke; the repressive governments of Bahrain and Egypt; the American occupying administration in Iraq; the polluting oil company Trafigura; the fracking company Cuadrilla; the athlete Oscar Pistorius after he was charged with murder; the Pinochet Foundation during its campaign against the former Chilean dictator&apos;s British detention; the much-criticised arms conglomerate BAE Systems \u2013 Bell or Bell Pottinger has represented all of them. &quot;They get involved in lots of &apos;special situations&apos;, in reputational and crisis PR,&quot; says Alec Mattinson, the deputy editor of PR Week. &quot;The reputation they have is as an agency that goes where other agencies would fear to tread.&quot;     A Buddhist monk puts on a gas mask during clashes in Bangkok. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters    This notoriety has had consequences. In 2011, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the Independent published a Bell Pottinger expos\u00e9, including covertly filmed company executives (though not Bell or Henderson) bragging about their influence over the Sri Lankan government and the British Conservative party, and about the firm&apos;s expertise in &quot;all sorts of dark arts&quot;. This August, anti-fracking protesters superglued themselves to the doors of Bell Pottinger&apos;s other London office, on a busy street in Holborn, during the morning rush hour. Last month, the BBC3 satirical show The Revolution Will Be Televised broadcast its attempt to gatecrash this year&apos;s Bell Pottinger summer party \u2013 a Whitehall gathering of dark-suited men with worldly auras \u2013 by a comedian dressed as the Devil and then as Hitler. Bell and the company have a range of responses to such frontal attacks. One is to claim victimhood: &quot;The left is extremely strong, and very active, and very keen on demonstrating its point of view by shouting at people,&quot; he says, with a world-weary shrug. &quot;It&apos;s become very fashionable to shoot the messenger.&quot; Another approach is to affect casualness. When I ask if Bell Pottinger is still working for the Sri Lankan government \u2013 citing commercial confidentiality or official secrecy, the firm does not publish a full list of clients \u2013 Bell says airily: &quot;We stopped in \u2026 2009? Or 2010? I might have got the dates wrong.&quot; Then he switches seamlessly to a sterner, man-of-the-world tone: &quot;It&apos;s a fashionable thing to criticise the way the Sri Lankan government has behaved. David Cameron had one meeting in the north of the country with 200 people who have lost relatives. You have to remember there was a 30-year civil war. The Tamil Tigers weren&apos;t exactly gentle, nice people. And for Britain to ponce around the world talking about human rights after what we did in Afghanistan \u2026 It&apos;s what Winston Churchill called &apos;our usual export&apos;: hypocrisy.&quot; Finally, and most ambitiously, Bell claims that his company is in fact a force for good. &quot;We are actually decent people,&quot; he says. &quot;We do know right from wrong. The reason we worked for Lukashenko in Belarus was because he told me: &apos;We want to go along the path to democracy.&apos; We actually got six political prisoners released.&quot;     Alexander Lukashenko, president of Belarus. Photograph: Pool/Reuters/Corbis    The shameless incompatability of all these arguments is typical Bell: always slippery, always trying a new line on you, and, deep down, probably trying to persuade himself. &quot;He&apos;s mercurial, quite emotional,&quot; says Hollingsworth. &quot;He can suddenly turn.&quot; Yet the question that hovers over Bell Pottinger is whether this theatrical, highly personalised approach exactly meets the needs of a modern PR multinational. After 20 highly quotable minutes in Bell&apos;s office, we are joined by Henderson. The chief executive, who only came to the company three years ago, is a quarter of a century younger than Bell, and has a much more sober background in financial and corporate PR. Unlike Bell, he keeps his suit jacket on. At first, while Bell talks and talks, Henderson stays quiet, rolling a pen between his fingers. Then, just as Bell is concluding a long, involved anecdote about why he turned down a chance to work for the authoritarian president of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, Henderson interjects: &quot;We have a very, very non-controversial client base now,&quot; he says. &quot;Our client base doesn&apos;t reflect what you read about in the press.&quot; The Bell Pottinger website mentions work for dozens of less-than-sinister entities such as Kurt Geiger, Daylesford Organic and the London Chamber Orchestra. Yet many of the commercial sectors the company lists as focuses for its PR activities \u2013 &quot;oil and gas&quot;, &quot;mining&quot;, &quot;financial institutions&quot;, &quot;Russia&quot; \u2013 suggest a readiness to work at the more rugged end of international capitalism. Your attitude to the company doing such work, says Bell, flashing a wide smile, &quot;does depend on your definition of controversial&quot;. Henderson argues that Bell Pottinger is disproportionately targeted by critics of London&apos;s hard-nosed PR world. &quot;These &apos;controversial&apos; clients \u2013 we do pitch for them against other PR companies,&quot; he points out. PR Week&apos;s Mattinson agrees: &quot;The idea that they&apos;re the only company prepared to work for controversial clients is a [mistake].&quot; In the magazine&apos;s league table of PR firms operating in Britain, Bell Pottinger is at number five; Hill &amp; Knowlton, a bigger American rival, controversial since the 30s, which has also promoted repressive governments and fracking, is just behind at number seven. Portland PR, a newer British firm set up by Tony Blair&apos;s former aide Tim Allan, has already achieved some notoriety for its work for authoritarian Kazakhstan and Russia. One reason, perhaps, why Bell Pottinger is singled out for special criticism is its lingering air of rightwing tribalism. When I ask Henderson why they haven&apos;t ever worked for controversial leftwing governments, such as the many currently in South America, he looks at me slightly uncomprehendingly, then says: &quot;We&apos;ve never been approached by a leftwing government, that I&apos;m aware of.&quot; Bell adds: &quot;You don&apos;t want an adviser that doesn&apos;t agree with you.&quot;     Tim Bell and James Henderson of Bell Pottinger. Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    Bell grew up in the aspiring, often politically conservative, outer suburbs of north London. His background was entrepreneurial and middle class: his Irish father was a gifted salesman and his Australian mother came from a shop-owning family, like Thatcher. As a young man during the 60s, Bell was less interested in politics than in his advertising career, and the flash clothes and cars it paid for, but he found time to canvass for several north London Tory MPs, including Thatcher. When she hired Bell and his then employers Saatchi &amp; Saatchi to work for her party in 1978, he and she immediately established a rapport. He became one of the closest in her inner circle of clever, often slightly roguish informal advisers, partly because they had a similar worldview: us-against-them, fiercely anti-communist, unquestioningly pro-market. &quot;If anyone inspired me, it&apos;s Ayn Rand,&quot; says Bell, namechecking the famously confrontational American rightwing author. Long after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Bell still privately referred to journalists he disliked as &quot;commies&quot; and &quot;pinkos&quot;. Henderson is less of a crusader. Privately educated, unlike Bell, more smartly spoken, more quietly dressed, he could be a Mayfair hedge-fund trader. &quot;We are all supportive of Tim and his politics,&quot; he says with a slightly fixed smile. Bell Pottinger&apos;s partisan and more straightforwardly corporate impulses, he goes on, &quot;can work well side by side&quot;. In a sense, this is right. Bell&apos;s work for the Conservatives in the 70s and 80s helped create a world \u2013 of London as a hub for the international rich, of the privatised utilities, of a post-communist, status-hungry eastern Europe \u2013 that has produced clients for Bell Pottinger, and Bell&apos;s previous PR enterprises, ever since. Much of what Bell Pottinger does for these clients is commercially confidential, but the company also needs to promote itself, and its website offers surprisingly detailed case studies. &quot;Katrin Radmacher is a German heiress,&quot; begins one. &quot;She asked Bell Pottinger to help uphold her reputation and manage the media during a legal marathon with her former husband \u2026 After each ruling, Bell Pottinger issued a highly quotable statement on her behalf to the world&apos;s media \u2026 When misconceptions arose, Bell Pottinger quietly briefed the press. A Tatler interview, establishing her as a privileged, yes, but unassuming mother of two who&apos;d tried to save her marriage, was syndicated in the Sunday Times. Evening Standard and FT interviews, and a Times leader, were sympathetic \u2026&quot;     A General Pinochet supporter. Photograph: Santiago Llanquin/AP    Bell Pottinger likes to portray itself as a dexterous media manipulator, yet sometimes the process is more fraught. In 1998, the campaign it helped orchestrate for the release of General Pinochet had a clever slogan \u2013 &quot;reconciliation not retribution&quot; \u2013 but also internal tensions. In 2000 Charles Alexander, a pro-Pinochet figure in the City of London, told me: &quot;I said on the first day after he [Pinochet] was arrested [in Britain], &apos;He&apos;s got to get very ill, very quickly.&apos; But Tim Bell disagreed with me. He said: &apos;Pinochet got rid of the commies, and that&apos;s our argument.&apos;&quot; In the end, the campaigners settled for an awkward mixture of both approaches, apolitically playing up Pinochet&apos;s frail health while also producing and distributing crude rightwing propaganda pamphlets and articles about the elected leftwing leader he had overthrown, Salvador Allende. The general eventually flew back to Chile, but with his international reputation even lower. Nowadays, Henderson&apos;s strategy for Bell Pottinger sometimes seems more safety-first. Last year, he, Bell, and the firm&apos;s co-founder, Piers Pottinger, a City of London PR veteran, organised a management buyout of the company, extricating it from the bigger communications conglomerate Chime. Since then, Henderson has emphasised &quot;rebuilding the Bell Pottinger brand&quot;, getting the firm &quot;up the league tables&quot;, and winning a greater &quot;number of mandates [contracts]&quot;. Much of this strategy is being enacted not in Mayfair, but in the Holborn office, which houses Henderson and nine-tenths of the firm&apos;s 250 staff. The Bell Pottinger premises there have a security guard in the lobby \u2013 perhaps on the lookout for more protesters with superglue \u2013 but otherwise seem a little more prosaic: a single floor of a heavy postwar office block, above a Sports Direct and an M&amp;S. In some ways, the PR business is getting harder and less glamorous. The internet and particularly social media are making Bell Pottinger&apos;s traditional publicity channel \u2013 the newspapers hung up in its Mayfair office, long susceptible to Bell&apos;s smooth phonecalls \u2013 less central to the making and unmaking of reputations. And the sour mood in many countries towards politicians, big business and the wealthy is making the public less ready to accept that such interest groups are not, as Bell Pottinger would put it, really such bad guys after all. &quot;The most difficult thing now in our business is having an impact,&quot; Bell acknowledges. &quot;You have to operate in more and more areas of distribution.&quot; Bell is a professional optimist, but occasionally seems gloomy about the modern world. &quot;I hate the internet,&quot; he told the authors Charles Vallance and David Hopper in a recent book on British entrepreneurs, The Branded Gentry. David Cameron does not enthuse him: &quot;I don&apos;t know him, and I don&apos;t understand him. He&apos;s obviously stuck in the Lynton Crosby strategy: be vile, and that&apos;ll do.&quot; Of course, this may be a piece of pragmatic positioning, as Cameron&apos;s chances of re-election begin to diminish. When I ask about Ed Miliband, Bell says brightly: &quot;He&apos;s obviously very clever, and has done some smart things.&quot; But he goes on to praise George Osborne for his &quot;clear&quot; free-market thinking. For all Bell&apos;s gut political feelings, Hollingsworth&apos;s biography shows he has long been willing to play situations both ways. In 1985 he told Media Week magazine: &quot;I want the BBC to fail&quot;; a month later, he took on the contract to do their advertising. At Bell Pottinger, clients with opposing interests are assigned separate PR teams, and the situation is kept manageable and ethical \u2013 at least by Bell Pottinger&apos;s standards \u2013 by internal &quot;Chinese walls&quot;. Clients are always informed when the firm is representing a rival, says Henderson, but few walk away. Bell Pottinger&apos;s ease with conflicts of interest, like its readiness to represent dubious clients, is easy to find chilling; but to detail and condemn it can act as a form of free advertising: there will always be people in the world who want an unsqueamish PR firm. Likewise any article that portrays Bell Pottinger as having tentacles everywhere: &quot;I&apos;m delighted to have people think we have a finger in every pie,&quot; says Henderson, finally smiling. &quot;Because that&apos;s our objective!&quot; In truth, both Bell Pottinger and their critics often overstate the firm&apos;s power. Henderson claims its work for Cuadrilla has &quot;completely changed the whole debate&quot; about fracking. It doesn&apos;t quite feel like that. Nor does it feel like world opinion has softened much over the decades towards Bell Pottinger&apos;s contentious government clients. In April, PR Week reported that the firm had &quot;annual revenues [in] the mid/high \u00a330m mark&quot; \u2013 high for a company with 250 employees, but modest compared with other rightwing media players such as Rupert Murdoch. Yet for Bell at least, precisely measuring the effect of Bell Pottinger&apos;s work \u2013 even if that were possible in the infinitely subjective world of PR \u2013 is probably not the point. &quot;I don&apos;t think he&apos;s ever been interested in being [part of] a big PR conglomerate,&quot; says biographer Hollingsworth. &quot;His life is about the buzz.&quot; Outside his top-floor office, the sun has gone in and a grey winter afternoon is settling over Mayfair. Our interview is past the hour and a half mark, yet Bell is still spinning tirelessly. &quot;My interest is in high-profile news,&quot; he says, unleashing another smile. &quot;It&apos;s nice to be part of what&apos;s going on.&quot; On the pavement below, the police officers outside the Saudi embassy pace up and down with their machine guns.", "publicationDate": "2013-12-09T19:01:00Z", "tags": ["Marketing & PR", "Media", "Margaret Thatcher", "Politics", "Business"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/dec/09/bell-pottinger-tim-bell-pr-interview", "title": "Dodgy regime?

Despite the PM&apos;s ostensibly placatory announcement, protest leaders and opposition parties vowed to continue mass anti-government demonstrations, suggesting the proposed 2 February poll amounted to a trick to perpetuate the rule of the Shinawatra &quot;regime&quot;. But so far they have failed to come up with a viable alternative plan for running the\u00a0country. The standoff threatens further to undermine democratic governance in a country where military coups have been commonplace and where parties defeated in elections have rarely accepted their fate with grace or dignity. Some Thai political scientists, in the style of America&apos;s Tea Party, are now claiming that winning the most votes is not necessarily the most important qualification for legitimately holding political office. Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy PM who leads the protests, said early elections would make no difference. &quot;The dissolving of parliament is not our aim,&quot; he said. Suthep has instead been calling for a new prime minister to be chosen by King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Thailand&apos;s ageing and influential monarch. He has also floated a proposal for an appointed &quot;people&apos;s council&quot; comprising &quot;decent men&quot; whose main task would appear to be the reconfiguring of the electoral system to ensure Yingluck, and her exiled elder brother and former PM, Thaksin Shinawatra, never again hold political power. Suthep suggests his Platonic wise-men oligarchy would eventually give way to an elected government, but has not said how long this would take. Opportunistic opposition parties, who also abhor Thaksin and his kin, have shown a similar lack of responsibility. In 2010, then prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, leader of an unelected government installed by Thaksin&apos;s opponents, survived a similar wave of street protests by pro-Thaksin &quot;red shirts&quot;. He had the army to thank for his rescue; about 90 people died during the unrest. Now Abhisit, leader of the main Democratic party opposition, is also refusing to say whether he will participate in the proposed February election. Most opposition MPs resigned from parliament on Sunday. &quot;House dissolution is the first step towards solving the problem,&quot; Abhisit said. &quot;Today, we march. I will walk with the people to Government\u00a0House.&quot; Yingluck&apos;s decision to allow Thailand&apos;s 66 million-strong population what is effectively a referendum on her Puea Thai government, which won in\u00a0a\u00a0landslide result in 2011, looks statesmanlike on the face of it, but is not quite what it seems. &quot;The government does not want any loss of life \u2026 At this stage, when there are many people opposed to the government from many groups, the best way is to give back the power to the Thai people and hold an election. So the Thai people will decide,&quot; she said in a televised speech. Yet the near certainty that Puea Thai will win again accounts for Suthep&apos;s and Abhisit&apos;s reluctance to go down the electoral route. While the opposition can count on support from middle-class Thais in Bangkok and the non-Muslim areas of the south and from pro-establishment royalists, they have been permanently outnumbered, electorally speaking, since Thaksin first won office in 2001 backed by the poorer, rural masses of the north and east. A telecoms billionaire whose populist presumption deeply offended traditional Thai hierarchies, Thaksin was deposed during his second term in 2006 by an army coup and fled the country two years later amid corruption and bribery allegations. Thaksin now lives in exile in Dubai, from where, his detractors allege, he controls the Bangkok government from a distance. The present unrest was sparked last month when Yingluck proposed an amnesty law that would have allowed her brother to return. Yingluck might also be congratulated for avoiding the violent clashes that have disfigured previous upheavals, and for keeping the army out of the fray. Thailand&apos;s military has staged or attempted 18 coups in the past 80 years, and is no stranger to political meddling. On the other hand, the generals, like the king, are no friends to the Thaksin clan. This time around, the army has said it does not want to get involved, although it has tried to mediate. Both sides have invoked the authority of the king to boost their positions. Both observed a truce last Thursday, the monarch&apos;s 86th birthday. But the reality is that Bhumibol is ill, frail and rarely seen. Nor is it wholly clear that the monarchy will survive his passing.

When Nelson Mandela died last week at the age of 95, it was with much less hysteria. There seemed more of a quiet dignity around his passing; more true to the man himself. Many words have been written since, and selecting the right ones for our front page took a bit of reading. We went with a piece by Gary Younge that had me near tears by the end. Thoughtful, poignant, moving ... those words feel overused, cliched, and hardly good enough for Younge&apos;s fitting tribute. We abandoned our world roundup of news (it usually appears on page 2-3) this week to give as much space as possible to a celebration of Mandela&apos;s life. Of course, there&apos;s much more on our website. South Africa may have come to a halt, but elsewhere the news rattled on. In Ukraine, authorities sent in riot police against protesters upset by President Viktor Yanukovych&apos;s decision not to sign an integration pact with the EU. In Thailand, authorities stepped back from a violent clash with protesters of their own, instead dissolving parliament and calling a general election to defuse the latest spasm gripping the Bangkok body politic. We look at troop buildup in the Central African Republic, a purge of staggering proportions in Pyongyang, some rather gentle words from Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, and riots jolting Singapore. Partner paper Le Monde reports from Portugal on golden visas for the well-heeled, and meets the doctors in Greece who are striking to bring attention to a medical system in need of much care. There&apos;s a super lineup of the Guardian&apos;s best in Comment &amp; Debate. Jonathan Freedland looks at life beyond liberation in India, Simon Tisdall assesses France&apos;s role in Africa, and Seumas Milne revisits the war on terror. Our deep-read Review section considers online activism, advancing polar bears, and how one magician conjures a hard sell out of a hat (that would be the lighter side of life). Science decodes the language of comics, Books considers why we explore the stars, and Culture reviews Australia&apos;s two contrasting art forms. I think our Eyewitnessed spread of images is especially engaging this edition, helping to balance out a week that was marked by conflict and grief. Balloons in Paris, sharks in the Bahamas and a wonderful snap of celebrity chef Nigella Lawson on her way to court, where she talked about marital strife and occasional drug use.

It is put together with lethal strangeness: there are bad-dream setpieces of sentimentality and nauseous black comedy. The film takes place in a universe of fear, a place of deepsea-unreality in which you need to breathe through special gills. It is a tragi-exploitation shocker, an enriched uranium-cake of pulp.  Ryan Gosling is the expatriate American gangster Julian, lying low in Bangkok and running a drug business under the cover of a Muay Thai boxing club, co-managed with his psychotic brother, Billy. Billy&apos;s horrible fate is to involve Julian in a metaphysical duel with enigmatic local cop Chang, played with eerie poise by Vithaya Pansringarm.  Chang dispenses his own justice with a samurai sword, and Julian \u2013 paralysed with some kind of guilt or suppressed qualm of conscience \u2013 is mesmerised by the mere rumour of Chang&apos;s avenging presence. The situation is complicated by the arrival in Thailand of Julian&apos;s formidable mother, uproariously played by Kristin Scott Thomas. Her imperious demands bring a horrible new Freudian dimension to the drama. Like Julian, like Chang, the film swims through the hostile streets, along corridors, into alleys, round corners, waiting for some terrible, nameless, violent destiny, and yet it entirely upends what you might expect from a revenge movie. This is a very brutal film, and enclosed in a kind of carapace of neon, a strange otherworld. Faces appear to glow in the artificial light, partly illuminated from within by their own madness.            Only God Forgives has something of Scorsese&apos;s Taxi Driver and No\u00e9&apos;s Enter the Void, granting access to a private hell. On its first appearance, it was excitably denounced and mocked by some critics. But with such a provocative film, some misjudgment is forgivable. \u2022\u00a0Interview: Nicolas Winding Refn on the aftermath of Only God Forgives", "publicationDate": "2013-12-11T09:40:00Z", "tags": ["Film", "Kristin Scott Thomas", "Culture", "Ryan Gosling", "Crime", "Thriller"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/11/10-best-films-2013-only-god-forgives", "title": "The 10 best films of 2013, No 8 \u2013 Only God Forgives", "sentences": ["Ryan Gosling is the expatriate American gangster Julian, lying low in Bangkok and running a drug business under the cover of a Muay Thai boxing club, co-managed with his psychotic brother, Billy."]}, {"article": "Abhisit Vejjajiva, Thailand&apos;s opposition leader and previous prime minister, has been formally charged with murder in a development that has the potential to further inflame protests by his supporters demanding the resignation of the current government.  Abhisit stands charged over the deaths of a 43-year-old man and a 14-year-old girl during a crackdown on anti-government protests during 2010 when he was in power. The Red Shirt movement had taken to the streets in support of Thaksin Shinawatra, who was thrown out as prime minister in a 2006 military coup. Thaksin&apos;s sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, now holds office as prime minister and the protesters on the streets demanding her ousting are aligned with Abhisit.  About 90 people were killed in the 2010 crackdown. Other cases are still pending against Abhisit. In 2010 the Red Shirt protesters occupied downtown Bangkok for months. Abhisit&apos;s government approved the use of live ammunition under limited conditions and deployed sharpshooters during the demonstrations. He has denied the charges against him. In the face of the current protests, Yingluck Shinawatra has dissolved parliament and called elections but rejected demonstrators&apos; demands to stand aside immediately and hand power to an unelected council. Protesters announced they cut off electricity to the prime minister&apos;s office compound on Thursday and demanded that police abandon the premises.The protesters have threatened to force their way in if police don&apos;t leave. Police attempts to negotiate were rebuffed, but they did not withdraw immediately. Police confirmed that power had been cut to some buildings in the compound, collectively called Government House. Protesters also cut barbed wire placed on top of the steel fence surrounding the compound while police stationed nearby looked on.

Born Estelle Loggin in Duncan, on Vancouver Island, Canada, she moved at the age of 10 with her parents to the UK. After attending Micklefield school in Seaford, East Sussex, she completed her English degree at Bedford College, University of London, just before the outbreak of the second world war. In 1940 she married Michael Friend Serpell, an assistant curator at the National Portrait Gallery, who went on to serve in British government security. My sister, Hilary, and I were born during the wartime evacuation of London. After the war, our family lived in the suburb of Barnes, commuting into London for work and school. A devoted home-maker and educator of her children, Estelle maintained a part-time professional career, offering evening lectures at the City Lit adult education college in Holborn on Know Your Classics, covering an international range of literature, and a diploma course in English literature. Michael&apos;s job meant travelling around the world, including stints in Singapore and Thailand, during which Estelle taught at the universities of Nanyang (1959-62) and Thammasat, Bangkok (1964-66) respectively. In 1966, they settled in the Norfolk village of Kenninghall, and Estelle continued to teach until the 1980s. Her approach to teaching aimed to cultivate aesthetic sensitivity and delight in the pursuit of knowledge. Education, she said, should be understood above all as &quot;a feast for the mind&quot;. She attributed her own love of literature to two of her teachers at Bedford College, FP Wilson and Louis MacNeice, and sought to inspire it in her students. Estelle&apos;s sense of social responsibility led her to undertake extensive voluntary work, as well as make donations to Oxfam. The same spirit informed her courageous advocacy on behalf of those facing bureaucratic oppression, and her decision to install solar-powered heating in her house. Her liberal political consciousness, initially somewhat restrained, eventually found expression in fundraising for the Social Democratic party. Estelle&apos;s life in many ways represented the maxim: &quot;Think globally, act locally.&quot; Above all, she was a loyal believer in personal relationships and was much loved and respected by family, friends, neighbours and students. Following Michael&apos;s death in 1983, Estelle remained a pillar of the community in Kenninghall for another 25 years. In 2009, her declining health led her to move to a nursing home in Hilary&apos;s Cornwall village of Coverack. She is survived by Hilary and me; seven grandchildren, Simon, Lucy, Harriet, Derek, Zewe, Namwali and Suwi; and 12 great-grandchildren.", "publicationDate": "2013-12-12T16:28:41Z", "tags": ["Higher education", "Education", "Louis MacNeice"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/dec/12/estelle-serpell-obituary", "title": "Estelle Serpell obituary", "sentences": ["Michael&apos;s job meant travelling around the world, including stints in Singapore and Thailand, during which Estelle taught at the universities of Nanyang (1959-62) and Thammasat, Bangkok (1964-66) respectively."]}, {"article": "Tens of thousands of Ukrainians are still camping in the centre of Kiev with slogans calling for democracy, freedom and the rule of law. Not many months ago Russian protesters were doing the same in Moscow. The Russian demonstrators were not so ambitious as to think they could by force of numbers overthrow the government, but their aspirations were no different from their Ukrainian counterparts. That parallel is just one illustration of the fallacy of the concept \u2013 better said, the prejudice \u2013 that what is going on in the streets of central Kiev revolves around &quot;European values&quot; that are alien to Russia, and that Ukraine is once again facing a civilisational choice between &quot;Europe&quot; and Russia. The notion that Ukraine needs to be detached from any links with Russia has been the primary error behind the European Union&apos;s clumsy and provocative approach to Ukraine under its so-called eastern partnership. The partnership initiative came from Sweden&apos;s Carl Bildt and Poland&apos;s Radek Sikorski, two of the EU&apos;s most anti-Russian and abrasive foreign ministers. Even after it was adopted by the EU in 2009, they continued to push themselves forward as its main champions instead of leaving the job to the more diplomatic Catherine Ashton and the EU&apos;s enlargement commissioner, Stefan Fule. It is no accident that the Bildt-Sikorski ideas took wing as Nato&apos;s hopes of getting Ukraine to join the ever-expanding Atlantic alliance were foundering on the unwillingness of most Ukrainians to take sides in the west&apos;s new cold war against Russia. Instead, Ukraine opted for neutrality. With Nato enlargement on ice, the hawks&apos; new focus switched to dangling EU links in front of six former Soviet republics, from Azerbaijan to Ukraine. It is the classic stuff of zero-sum games which Russia has also adopted by recently creating a rival Eurasian Union with the same potential ex-Soviet members as well as the central Asian &quot;stans&quot;. Ukraine has long been a complex structure. This year is the 1,025th anniversary of the formation of Kievan Rus, the assemblage of east Slavic tribes under Christianity, and a timely reminder that many Slavs still see Kiev as Russia&apos;s mother city, long pre-dating Moscow. The western parts of what is today&apos;s Ukraine were later in the Austro-Hungarian empire, while the eastern part was under the Russian tsars. The split between Orthodoxy and Catholicism created further divisions. Twenty years since the collapse of the Soviet Union and Ukraine&apos;s independence, the country&apos;s economy is almost equally linked to Russia and the EU. Its trade turnover with the EU is exactly the same as its turnover with Russia, and in both directions it has the same deficit, exporting less than it imports. So the logical message from history, politics and current economics is surely that Ukraine should be allowed to co-operate with both sides without having any doors slammed. Yet the EU has consistently told the authorities in Kiev that even to sign an association agreement with the EU (full membership is not on offer) would not be compatible with being part of the Eurasian Union. When Ukraine&apos;s president, Viktor Yanukovych, turned down the agreement which he had been expected to sign at an EU summit in Vilnius a fortnight ago, the surprise should not have been his abrupt change of mind but the fact that he had continued the negotiations with Brussels for so long. Russia&apos;s president, Vladimir Putin, prompted the volte-face by threatening Ukraine with economic penalties but here, too, the surprise is that the Russian leader had not reacted to the EU&apos;s hard line sooner. A comparison with Georgia is instructive. When the small Caucasian republic was led by the confrontational and rabidly pro-Nato Mikheil Saakashvili, the Kremlin could barely tolerate anything he did. With his departure, Putin accepted Georgia&apos;s signature at the Vilnius summit on a similar EU deal to Ukraine&apos;s while also improving Russia&apos;s own trade relations with Georgia. As the crisis deepens, Yanukovych is still trying to deal with both Moscow and Brussels. He has dispatched delegations in each direction. It looks like a clumsy effort to extract cash by exploiting the artificial tug-of-war that Brussels has promoted, but Yanukovych has no alternative. The EU agreement offers no budget relief but is linked to an IMF deal that would produce cash if Ukraine accepted its terms for ending industrial and other subsidies. Russia is offering cheap gas. The most urgent requirement is political rather than economic: how to end the confrontation on the streets. Yanukovych is right not to resign, as the more extreme of his opponents are demanding. He would be falling victim to the &quot;curse of Cairo&quot; whereby an elected leader is forced out by crowds. The street uprising against Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade in 2000 and the Orange protests in Kiev in 2004 were sparked by fraud and ballot-rigging. What took place in Egypt this year was not, yet its undemocratic echo spread to Bangkok last month, and now to Kiev. Most of Ukraine&apos;s post-Soviet elite is neither reform-minded nor genuinely committed to democracy. Oligarchs, and the media they control, are playing a large role on both sides of the Kiev barricades. But Yanukovych was elected in a poll judged free and fair. Under pressure from three former Ukrainian presidents he has called for a national dialogue with civic leaders. If it produces the release of detainees, the end of the protesters&apos; occupation of public buildings and agreed rules for the 2015 election, it will have been useful. On the wider front, Yanukovych has proposed tripartite talks with Russia and the EU, a line that the Kremlin supports. The EU should reject Carl Bildt&apos;s supercilious comment, &quot;What is there to talk about?&quot; and accept the idea. Otherwise, today&apos;s crisis will repeat itself soon.

Driven by rising demand for ivory from east Asia, it has doubled over the past five years into a global trade worth $10bn, threatening political and economic stability in central Africa. This month there were warnings that Africa could lose one-fifth of its elephants in the next decade if the continent&apos;s poaching crisis is not stopped. By the end of September, a record 704 rhinos had been killed by poachers in South Africa and 47 in Kenya this year. Figures showed two-thirds of forest elephants had been killed by ivory poachers in past decade. Some high-profile massacres hit the headlines, with 86 elephants \u2013 including 33 pregnant females\u2013  killed in less than a week in Chad, 26 elephants slaughtered at a wildlife-viewing site in the Central African Republic and 80 poisoned at a water hole in Zimbabwe. While conservation groups looked to technology such as surveillance drones and GPS trackers to aid their efforts, park rangers lost lives and faced corruption fighting a one-sided war against increasingly militarised and organised gangs of poachers sometimes linked to terrorist groups like Al-Shabaab. With Prince Charles and his son the Duke of Cambridge calling for a &quot;war on poachers&quot;, UK prime minister David Cameron announced he would host the highest level global summit to date on combating the illegal wildlife trade. In the US, the Obama administration said it would destroy all 6m tonnes of its ivory stocks and the Philippines crushed 5m tonnes of seized ivory beneath industrial rollers.     Hedgehogs struggled to emerge from hibernation. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian    In 2013 the weather played a big part for British wildlife, with a wet winter, a &quot;delayed spring&quot; and hot summer affecting both flora and fauna. As cold spell continued into April, conservationists warned hedgehogs, birds, insects, reptiles and frogs were all struggling.  In May, the National Trust embarked on a census to discover whether puffin numbers had plummeted after a year of extreme weather, and the UK barn owl population was reported to have suffered its worst breeding season for more than 30 years after a run of extreme weather events. The erratic weather had a knock-on effect later in the year with species like wasps and butterflies being seen a month later than usual.     Of the 17 species of butterflies found in Europe, eight have declined, including the common blue.  Photograph: Alan Mather/Alamy    Decline was a word used frequently throughout 2013 when it came to talking about wildlife in the UK and around the world. The significant State of Nature report, published in May, found that more than half of UK wildlife species are in decline. In October an audit of more than 200 native UK species \u2013 including birds, bats, moths, butterflies, hares and doormice \u2013 showed that priority species have declined on average by 58% since 1970. Europe&apos;s grassland butterfly population has plummeted in the past two decades, new research published in 2013 showed, with a near halving in the numbers of key species since 1990. And after the miserable summer of 2012, there were fewer butterflies in British skies in 2013 than for thousands of years, leaving several species in danger of extinction from parts of the country. British moths are also in calamitous decline, a major report showed in February, declining in southern Britain by 40% over 40 years. In British waterways, a new five-year survey found that the water vole \u2013 the creature immortalised as Ratty in The Wind in the Willows \u2013 is vanishing from the British countryside, with the population slumping by more than one\u2013fifth. More than 4,000 birds of at least 18 species washed up dead or were affected by a sticky substance covering beaches from Cornwall to Dorset in two separate incidents in January and April this year.     Some of Britain's most familiar countryside birds like the turtle dove have plummeted in numbers since the 1990s. Photograph: Andrew Darrington/Alamy    There were mixed fortunes for bird populations in 2013. In December, the authoritative State of the UK&apos;s Birds report concluded that some of Britain&apos;s most familiar countryside birds have plummeted in numbers since the 1990s, with some species disappearing altogether from parts of the UK. The report drew heavily on the British Trust for Ornithology&apos;s mammoth volunteer-led project the Bird Atlas 2007-11, published a month earlier. The new atlas of 1,300 maps shows the patterns of distribution, abundance and change among 296 bird species in Britain and Ireland. In October, statistics showed the number of wild birds in the UK was still falling, and among garden birds, starlings, house sparrows and other threatened species suffered further declines. The decline in birds of prey continued, with the hen harrier failing to breed in England this summer for the first time since the 1960s. The species now stands on the brink of extinction, with rogue grouse moor gamekeepers blamed for their decline. Cases of the illegal persecution of British birds is continuing to rise, a December report from the RSPB showed, with 208 reports of the shooting and destruction of birds of prey in 2012. It is hoped legal changes that will be debated in parliament next year will introduce stricter penalties for wildlife crimes. The fortunes of the house sparrow seemed to be changing in 2012, however, with figures in September showing that the decline in their numbers appears to have levelled off.     Three bee-harming pesticides were banned in Europe this year. Photograph: Arnd Wiegmann/Reuters    In April, the European Union suspended the use of three neonicotinoid pesticides linked to serious harm in bees, despite the opposition of the UK ministers. In June the UK government launched an &quot;urgent&quot; review of the crisis facing bees and other pollinators in the UK and pledged to introduce a national pollinator strategy.     Posters protesting against the badger cull. Photograph: Alamy    In August, the controversial badger cull went ahead  \u2013 amid protests \u2013 in Gloucestershire and west Somerset, in two pilot schemes attempting to stop the spread of bovine tuberculosis in cattle. Despite the cull being extended, it failed to reach its target, meaning it was &quot;very likely&quot; that the risk of tuberculosis in cattle had gone up, not down, according to an expert.     Oak processionary moth caterpillars cover a tree trunk. Photograph: Patrick Pleul/Alamy    British trees were under attack in 2013 from a variety of threats including sweet chestnut blight, the oak processionary moth caterpillar, and one year after it broke out in the UK, ash dieback disease. Britain&apos;s 80 million ash trees remain at deadly risk from ash dieback caused by Chalara fraxinea, a virulent fungal disease that has swept across Europe. Latest figures from the Forestry Commission reported a total of 613 sightings in nurseries, plantations and established woodland around the UK. In October the St Jude storm that swept across England was estimated to have killed around 10 million trees. Internationally, destruction of the Amazon rainforest increased by almost one-third in the past year, reversing a decade-long trend of better protection for the world&apos;s greatest rainforest. But almost 200,000 hectares of Tasmania&apos;s old growth forest were world heritage-listed in 2013, bringing hope that a three-decade fight between environmentalists, politicians and loggers is over. Internationally, the Cites international wildlife summit in Bangkok awarded protection against the finning trade to five shark species, but failed to halt the polar bear trade. Iceland resumed its commercial hunting of fin whales after a two-year suspension. In November, the IUCN published its annual &quot;red list&quot;. The latest update of endangered species showed worrying declines for the okapi, the white-winged flufftail, the red belly toad, Caribbean skinks and the martial eagle. Another study published by the IUCN this year showed that nearly one in five of the world&apos;s estimated 10,000 species of lizards, snakes, turtles, crocodiles and other reptiles are threatened with extinction.     Emperor penguins in Antarctica. Photograph: Frans Lanting/Corbis    Talks to create the world&apos;s two largest marine reserves in the Antarctic broke down in November for the third time in a year, with conservationists branding Russia a &quot;repeat offender&quot; for blocking an international agreement. In the UK, ministers named 27 new marine conservation zones in November to protect seahorses, coral reefs, oyster beds and other marine life \u2013 four less than ministers proposed and far short of the 127 zones recommended by the government&apos;s own consultation. A hard-fought battle over European Union fisheries policy saw the ending of the wasteful practice of fish discards, with an agreement signed to gradually phase out the practice \u2013 where unwanted fish is thrown back into the sea \u2013 from 2015 to 2019. The Fish Fight campaign by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, the chef and Guardian food writer, was cited by the European commission as a key factor in winning the battle.     The Cape Melville leaf-tailed gecko was among three new species discovered in a 'lost world' in northern Queensland. Photograph: Conrad Hoskin/AFP/Getty Images    The discovery of new species made for some welcome respite from the bad news. In October, a leaf-tail gecko, a golden-coloured skink and a boulder-dwelling frog were three new species discovered in a &quot;lost world&quot; in northern Queensland, Australia. In Suriname, scientists discovered 60 species new to science, including a chocolate-coloured frog and a tiny dung beetle less than 3mm long. A purring monkey, a vegetarian piranha and a flame-patterned lizard were among more than 400 new species of animals and plants that have been discovered in the past four years in the Amazon rainforest, conservationists say. And there were other good news stories. Sightings of the variable harlequin toad (Atelopus varius) \u2013 thought to be extinct in Costa Rica \u2013 led researchers to believe other isolated fragments of Central America&apos;s disappearing amphibians may survive in regions scourged by the deadly chytrid fungus disease. One of the world&apos;s most elusive wild cats, the Bornean bay cat (Pardofelis badia) was captured on camera in a heavily logged area of Borneo rainforest together with four other endangered species, suggesting that some wildlife can survive in highly disturbed forests. In September, a landmark project to reintroduce the extinct short-haired bumblebee (Bombus subterraneus) to the UK celebrated its first milestone after experts confirmed that queens had nested and produced young. Spain&apos;s endangered Iberian lynx was brought back from brink of extinction thanks to an imaginative conservation programme that has brought hunters, farmers and the tourist industry under its wing. And beaver, bison and eagles were named among the species that have made a successful comeback in Europe in the past 50 years, according to a major survey published in September.", "publicationDate": "2013-12-16T13:10:00Z", "tags": ["Wildlife", "Conservation", "Environment", "Illegal wildlife trade", "Trees and forests", "Ash dieback", "Deforestation", "Marine life", "Insects", "Birds", "Butterflies", "Rivers", "Endangered habitats", "Endangered species", "Bees", "Badgers", "Fishing", "World news", "UK news", "Australia news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/dec/16/2013-review-wildlife-crime-natural-world", "title": "2013 in review: the year wildlife crime became an international security issue | Jessica Aldred", "sentences": ["Internationally, the Cites international wildlife summit in Bangkok awarded protection against the finning trade to five shark species, but failed to halt the polar bear trade."]}, {"article": "Hi Vithaya, your role in Only God Forgives is one of the creepiest and nastiest in recent cinema. What qualified you for the part? I run a successful ballet school in Bangkok, my wife is a ballet teacher, and I have managed the school for 19 years. Oh. So how did you get into acting? This is how I start my acting career. About five years ago, I went to a party and a cameraman saw me and asked me to act in his short film. I said sure, why not? After that the same cameraman got a job on a Hollywood movie shooting in Thailand. That movie was looking for a character of a king, but the director couldn&apos;t find anyone she liked. They said: &quot;Hey, why don&apos;t you come in and read the dialogue.&quot;That&apos;s how I got my first movie. That&apos;s The Prince &amp; Me: The Elephant Adventure, I take it? Yeah, it&apos;s the sequel to The Prince and Me. Then I started doing small parts in international productions. In Hangover 2 I had a tiny part at the end as a priest. That was fun. Must have been. I have never done Thai soap opera or Thai movies, so my style is very western, very small movement but all about the energy. This casting director said to me, a director from Denmark wants to do a movie in Thailand and your style would fit perfectly with his script. So we made a tape and sent it to Nick, and Nick liked it. I thought, wow, this is special because Chang was not a small part at all. But this was before he made Drive, right? Right. Back in 2010, the original idea was that Luke Evans would do the Julian part, but then Ryan said he wanted to do it, but he had to do Gangster Squad first. Meanwhile, I&apos;m sitting in Bangkok, waiting for it to happen. Then Nick said he would do Only God Forgives next, and in my mind I was sure they were not going to use a no-name Thai actor like me. Nick just won Cannes, Ryan is a A-list pinup Hollywood actor \u2013 they&apos;re going to recast and get someone famous. But when Nick came to Thailand, at the end of 2011, we met in person and he said he really liked me. Were you intimidated when you found out you were acting opposite Ryan Gosling? I thought: am I dreaming? Is this happening to me? Like I say in the movie, God would not give you something you can&apos;t handle. On the first day we are introduced at the production company, they were having a kind of Hindu ritual ceremony. In Thailand we do this, just to bless the start of the movie. It&apos;s a prayer to Ganesh, very spiritual, everybody wear white, fragrant flowers everywhere. Ryan comes in this big van, they sat me next to him. He&apos;s half asleep, wearing his big black glasses. Then all of a suddenhe turns to me and says: &quot;Hey, I heard you make good pad thai fried noodle, right?&quot; Then we get on very well! He was super down to earth. It released a lot of stress for me. You do a lot of sword slicing in the film. Can you handle one in real life? I&apos;m a fifth degree black belt in kendo. Japanese fencing. So that would be a yes. How do you feel about the violence in OGF? It&apos;s pretty intense stuff. The way I see the violence in OGF is this. Nicholas create a feeling, with the foreplay \u2013 you know he always call himself pornographer, right? \u2013 the way he build up a scene. It takes me just three seconds to cut someone eyes out, but the scene is so effective because of all the buildup that happened before. For me, Chang is an angel of vengeance. He&apos;s basically a character who has responsibility to protect his kingdom or his country, his people, so his violence is not for hate, or some kind of discrimination \u2013 it is punishing people who have a bad karma. I look from the eastern philosophy point of view: you show people being punished for what they did. Billy and Julian, they think they can escape from their karma \u2013 but you can&apos;t, you have to pay for it. The karaoke scenes are particularly frightening. You sang them all yourself, I was told. You know, I love singing at party, but never become a professional. This character, when he sings karaoke, he is not entertaining people, or making people happy. He is not smiling or enjoying himself. Symbolically the karaoke is the place he purifies himself after all the madness. Has the phone been ringing off the hook since you made the film? Now Thai film makers are scared to ask me because they think I am too expensive as I have done a Hollywood movie. But I say: I am looking forward to working with good directors in Thailand. I&apos;m not saying I&apos;m picky but since OGF I only accept good offers. You know, at my age you are either semi-retired or picking up grandchilden \u2013 but discovering this new job, it&apos;s fantastic for me. \u2022\u00a0Only God Forgives is available on Blu-ray &amp; DVD now", "publicationDate": "2013-12-19T19:30:00Z", "tags": ["Film", "Ryan Gosling", "Nicolas Winding Refn", "Culture", "Luke Evans"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/19/vithaya-pansringarm-ryan-gosling-only-god-forgives", "title": "Vithaya Pansringarm on acting opposite Ryan Gosling in Only God Forgives", "sentences": ["I run a successful ballet school in Bangkok, my wife is a ballet teacher, and I have managed the school for 19 years.", "Meanwhile, I&apos;m sitting in Bangkok, waiting for it to happen."]}, {"article": "European markets rallied on Thursday after the US Federal Reserve pledged to keep the cost of borrowing at rock-bottom levels for longer than expected, offsetting its decision to begin trimming back its massive $85bn a month stimulus programme. But US stocks fell in early trading on Thursday, losing some of their gains made immediately after the Fed&apos;s announcement, as a more sombre Wall Street was caught off guard by a surprise rise in unemployment benefit claimants. Emerging markets, which suffered massive capital outflows in the summer over investor jitters about the end of cheap money, also saw stocks fall. The outgoing Fed chairman Ben Bernanke announced on Wednesday a scaling back of the US&apos;s bond buying programme to $75bn in January. But Bernanke stressed that support would only continue to be withdrawn if unemployment carries on falling. Meanwhile he signalled that interest rates were likely to stay low even when unemployment drops below 6.5%. It was a softly-softly approach that soothed markets, sparking a 290-point relief rally on the Dow Jones on Wednesday, a rise of 1.84%. The mood on Wall Street was less buoyant on Thursday, as it emerged that jobless-benefit claims rose by 10,000 last week to 379,000, a nine-month high. Some analysts said investors should not be discouraged by the jump in the numbers, as claims are typically volatile over the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday period with fluctuations in temporary staff. The US unemployment rate fell to a five-year low of 7% in November, an improvement that signalled to markets the stimulus cut was on the agenda. &quot;After the enthusiastic reaction of the US markets following [Wednesday] night&apos;s statement, it is possibly no surprise that having a night to reflect fully on the implications has seen a more measured response from traders in the early trading session,&quot; said Alistair McCaig, a market analyst at IG. &quot;The current levels of these indices mean that the possibility of a Christmas rally will be a more closely-run thing on the [US] side of the Atlantic.&quot; While US stocks were flat, investors rushed to dump five and seven-year US Treasury bonds, amid lingering doubts about the Fed&apos;s commitment to low rates. &quot;The more the Fed leans with the wind in the coming years, the sooner the economy is likely to get back to &quot;interest-rate-neutral&quot; full employment. So even though we think the Fed will tread very carefully and only begin to raise rates in 2015, we still forecast the 10-year yield to drift higher to 3.5% by the end of that year,&quot; said John Higgins at Capital Economics. The Bank of England governor Mark Carney had warned only on Tuesday of the &quot;great risk&quot; associated with unwinding the huge stimulus programmes that the Fed had started five years ago. The Bank has pumped \u00a3375bn into the UK economy since 2009 under the British version of QE. Market watchers thought that the long-awaited Fed announcement was the main factor driving market sentiment in Europe, notwithstanding an agreement among eurozone ministers on a new system to wind up failing banks. The FTSE100 finished the day up 1.43% at 6,584 points, while Germany&apos;s DAX advanced 1.7% to 9,335. &quot;It will be interesting to see if indices around the EU are able to maintain momentum,&quot; said McCaig. &quot;The impression prior to [Wednesday] night&apos;s events was that these indices were as dependent, if not more so, to the quantitative easing [money-printing stimulus] process than their US counterparts.&quot; Developing economies saw stocks wobble after the decision to unwind the taper, with the MSCI Emerging Markets index dropping 0.4% to 989.01, but market analysts saw other factors at work. Turkey is in the throes of a corruption crisis that has led to mass arrests and a stand-off between the police and Recep Tayyip Erdogan&apos;s government.

In Russia, President Vladimir Putin&apos;s promise of a decree to free former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky send the Micex up 0.8%. The Indonesian rupiah hit a fresh five-year low on Thursday, but the Fed&apos;s move was welcomed by the deputy governor of bank Indonesia, Perry Warjiyo. &quot;The announcement provides more clarity for the direction of Fed monetary policy,&quot; he told Reuters.

The views across the rooftops are like something out of The Aristocats. I lived in an aparment there for three months during the late 1980s, while I was studying for my MA: the Royal College of Art has a studio there, and I always go back \u2013 I love going to all those archives and conservatoires and collections of great cultural stuff. When I first lived there, in the 80s, Paris was trying to understand what it might be again. Lots of grand Mitterand projets were happening \u2013 such as Jean Nouvel&apos;s Institut du Monde Arabe \u2013 and the Pompidou Centre was really being used a lot. I love the Pierre Huyghe exhibition at the Pompidou. It&apos;s very experiential. There are three machines that throw water, steam and ice on you, and a white dog with one purple leg walks around the exhibition. There used to be a hip scene out in the 13th [arrondissement, south-east of the centre]. They tried to develop the area by getting all the young, happening galleries in. But it got expensive and felt far away and now the galleries have mostly moved back to the Marais, around Rue Louise Weiss. Make sure you visit the GB Agency which has some really interesting young artists, such as [video artist] Omer Fast and Pratchaya Phinthong from Bangkok; it&apos;s full of energy. Try to come for the annual Nuit Blanche in October, when all the galleries stay open late \u2013 until at least 9pm. Walk into any gallery in the Marais and ask for a gallery map \u2013 you can then run from one to another and grab a glass of wine in each. It&apos;s fantastic fun. The revamped Palais de Tokyo near the Trocad\u00e9ro, looks like a Tom Ford version of Bladerunner. I would recommend both the vegetable couscous in the Tokyo Eat cafe, and the exhibition of Philippe Parreno installations (until 12 January): Parreno is one of the most thought-provoking figures in modern art. Paris nightlife isn&apos;t that good. Well, it enjoyed a flamboyant and exotic heyday, but it seems more private these days. It&apos;s a difficult place to luck into. I used to drink at a bar called the Madame Deux, on rue de S\u00e9vign\u00e9. It wasn&apos;t arty but was where all the firemen went; the crowd was effervescent and didn&apos;t mind a &quot;rosbif&quot; drinking with them. I wouldn&apos;t want the place filling up with Guardian readers, but the food at Chez Marie Louise in the 10th arrondissement is delicious. It&apos;s a tiny restaurant with just two waiters who know so much about the food and wine, you feel they&apos;re the ones who put the menu together. If you&apos;re a vegetarian, people look at you as if you&apos;re ill. They&apos;re shocked that a ham omelette isn&apos;t considered a vegetarian meal. There&apos;s only so much height in Paris. You can see the Eiffel Tower from everywhere. When I come back to London, I take a deep breath because we&apos;re getting all these skyscrapers. I know it&apos;s a cliche but Paris is actually very romantic, in a relationshippy way. Maybe people there are just more keen on expressing themselves outwardly. For a day trip outside Paris, head to Senlis, a medieval town that&apos;s home to the Fondation Franc\u00e9s. It&apos;s a perfectly formed private art museum where I&apos;m showing and part-curating a show called Vestige\u00a0next February. It deals with waste, both human and material, and features pieces by Florian S\u00fcssmayr, Jake and Dinos Chapman and Subodh Gupta. \u00a0 If I spent Christmas in Paris, I would like to spend my time visiting graves in the P\u00e8re-Lachaise cemetery.

The sky is thundery and the sea is a uniform shade of sludge. Shun-Wen Tong, a 22-year-old student from the Chinese city of Hangzhou, cranes his neck to look at the town 54 floors below: concrete hotel blocks, pulsating traffic and directly beneath him, half- hidden in the tropical gloom, an amusement park called Funny Land. The off-season weather is just one of the dodgy things about Pattaya \u2013 a resort known to many as &quot;Thailand&apos;s Blackpool&quot;, it is two hours outside Bangkok \u2013 but Tong is savouring every moment. &quot;It&apos;s magical. I&apos;m very happy,&quot; he says, holding his camera in one hand and a complimentary orange juice in the other. &quot;Finally I am seeing the world.&quot; Tong is on his first-ever overseas trip. For him it&apos;s a thrilling, life-changing experience. But to the rest of world he&apos;s not just any tourist. He&apos;s a Chinese tourist \u2013 that is, a global phenomenon, an unstoppable trend, a lucrative opportunity. International travel has been growing among the Chinese over the past decade, with rising prosperity at home and the relaxation of Communist government travel restrictions. Now millions are on the move. &quot;Chinese tourism,&quot; said CNN breathlessly in April, &quot;might be the biggest phenomenon to hit the global travel industry since the invention of commercial flight.&quot; In 2012 the Chinese overtook Americans and Germans as the world&apos;s top international tourism spenders, heading off on 83m foreign trips and spending $102bn. By early 2015, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organisation, Chinese globetrotters will take more than 100m overseas trips. By 2020 the figure will double to an incredible 200m. In Thailand, the number of Chinese tourists shot up by 107% this year, nudging Bangkok ahead of London to become the world&apos;s most visited city in Mastercard&apos;s latest survey.     A crowd of Chinese tourists cheer during the elephant show, where the animals perform stunts such as football and painting, at Nong Nooch Tropical Botanical Garden in Pattaya. Photograph: Nana Chen for the Observer    Everyone is scrambling for a\u00a0share of the spoils. In October, the British government announced plans to simplify UK visa procedures for nationals from China, with the goal of trebling Chinese tourists to Britain by 2015. India has launched Chinese-language Life of Pi tours after the film was a box-office hit in China, while Greece is promoting &quot;idyllic island honeymoons&quot; to the Chinese market. Even the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe is currently trying to negotiate a &quot;preferential tourism pact&quot; with Beijing \u2013 despite diplomatic strains last year after police outside Harare arrested four Chinese migrant workers for allegedly killing and eating rare tortoises. With the proliferating numbers has come the predictable but mostly misplaced sentiment that Chinese travellers have taken over from Americans as the world&apos;s new &quot;ugly&quot; tourists. The trend for independent travel is sharply on the rise, especially among the younger Chinese. But around half of all Chinese tourists still travel in organised groups \u2013 a\u00a0factor that increases their collective visibility and amplifies stereotypes and cultural unfamiliarity on both sides. Reports abound that Chinese tourists are loud and rude, or that they refuse to queue or give tips. Other complaints range from the practical to the surreal. In July, residents of the small Swiss city of Lucerne protested that up to 120 Chinese tour buses a day were paralysing local traffic, as they deposited tourists who wanted to buy luxury watches. Then there were bizarre reports, picked up by the Chinese media, of competing Chinese honeymooners brawling in French lavender fields over the best spot for photos to capture a\u00a0&quot;Monet moment&quot;. A group travelling to North Korea drew scorn for throwing sweets to children as though they were &quot;feeding ducks&quot;, while a\u00a0number of Chinese tourists in the Maldives were reportedly caught giving fake marriage papers to upmarket resorts in order to get free dinners offered to newlyweds. Still, the fact that such tales make headlines seems to reflect the current hypersensitivity towards Chinese behaviour abroad more than anything else. In a recent poll by lifestyle website LivingSocial, Americans were still ranked the least popular foreign tourists by five different countries, including, tellingly, by Americans themselves. Brits and Germans fared little better.     An elderly woman fans herself among other Chinese tourists. She had her beehive set to last the duration of her holiday. Photograph: Nana Chen for the Observer    Thailand is at the forefront of the boom. With its mix of temples, beaches and duty-free shopping, the self-styled &quot;land of smiles&quot; is the most popular destination for Chinese tourists after the satellite Chinese territories of Hong Kong and Macao. Tong is visiting Thailand with 35 others from Hangzhou city in southeastern China, including his youthful-looking grandparents, on a seven-day organised tour. The tour cost \u00a3500 each, including flights. &quot;I wanted to come here to see the elephants and the Buddha statues. It&apos;s a very holy place,&quot; he says. &quot;But my family chose it mostly because it&apos;s only a four-hour flight from China and we got a good deal.&quot; Pattaya is on almost every Chinese tour group&apos;s itinerary. A former fishing village, it grew into a tourist playground during the Vietnam war, when American forces on R&amp;R discovered its then-pristine, palm-fringed bay. Girly bars, theme parks and golf courses quickly multiplied. Today it attracts about 8\u00a0million tourists annually, including more than a\u00a0million from China. Yet Chinese tourists are oddly absent from the town&apos;s teeming centre and main beaches. They&apos;re not hard to find once you know where to look. Car parks jammed with coaches signal the mass presence of tour groups at Pattaya&apos;s numerous elephant shows, crocodile and snake farms, ladyboy cabarets and outlet shopping malls. In Thailand, the proportion of Chinese travelling in tour groups rises to 70%. Most tours go from one self-contained attraction to the next, stopping only for lunch at Chinese restaurants (eating Thai food is usually a separate activity) before returning for the evening to their high-rise hotels. It&apos;s left to the Russians \u2013 the other great tourist influx in recent years \u2013 to play chicken in the main bay on screaming jet skis and haggle with beach vendors over the price of polyester sarongs. At Sriracha tiger zoo, which sees around 2,000 Chinese tourists daily, visitors can pose for photos with one of the 400 tigers kept in dusty enclosures. They can also &quot;enjoy the intelligence of the pigs in the pig show&quot; or shoot targets with air guns to make meat drop into feeding troughs in the Shoot &apos;N&apos; Feed tiger arena. The zoo has existed for years amid controversy over whether the docile tigers are drugged or beaten, as well as its racial stereotyping policy of hiring Africans to pose in loincloths \u2013 but Chinese tourists on a schedule have no time to think about any of that.     Life is a cabaret: a group of katoeys, or ladyboys, pose with two Chinese tourists. Photograph: Nana Chen for the Observer    Shu-Hsuan Chi and Tzu-Chen Wu, both in their 60s, are scuttling to a tiger-feeding session. The two women from the northeastern port city of Dalian worked in the same grocery shop. They are celebrating their retirement with a 10-day tour of Japan, Korea and Thailand. Pattaya is their last stop. &quot;We have no economic problems in China now and free time to travel,&quot; says Wu. She is sporting a beehive hairstyle she has had done specially &quot;to last for the whole trip&quot; to avoid having to visit a foreign salon. &quot;It has been tiring but enjoyable. We have many things to tell our family and friends about when we get back home.&quot; Another tourist, 40-year-old property developer Min Liu from central Henan province, also says he&apos;ll have plenty to talk about when he returns. But most of it won&apos;t be positive. &quot;This is the first and last time I will leave China,&quot; he says. He came overseas &quot;out of curiosity&quot; but thinks Thailand is inefficient and much more unsafe than China. &quot;Also, the local food smells bad and the flavour is wrong. It&apos;s not suitable for Chinese people,&quot; says the burly bald-headed man. The Chinese travel boom is similar to past waves of mass tourism among newly affluent middle classes. Thomas Cook basically invented the package tour in the 1850s when he began taking groups of British industrialists on two-week &quot;grand circular tours&quot; of Europe, sparking a new leisure activity among the well-heeled (who also grumbled about the exotic food). Americans followed with their loud voices and even louder leisurewear in the plentiful 1950s. Then came the Japanese, with their sun hats and cameras, in the &quot;economic bubble&quot; years of the 1970s and 80s. A major difference today is that the global travel industry is much more developed and finely calibrated to maximising profit. Providing endless &quot;attractions&quot; and services to woo tourists is now gigantic business, with tourism currently worth an estimated 9% of global GDP. (The global arms industry, by random contrast, is worth an estimated 2.5%.) Even when tourists don&apos;t travel in groups, as fewer Chinese are doing as time goes on, it&apos;s not easy for countries to find the right balance between proscribing their activities and letting them discover places for themselves. Pimpingfar Chokrapinnpass, a\u00a0marketing officer at the Tourism Authority of Thailand, admits as much: &quot;We want visitors to have authentic experiences of our culture and people, but it&apos;s not always possible because of the way the industry works.&quot; Chinese tourism has been slow to take off in the UK partly because Britain is not included in the Schengen programme that allows travellers to visit most of Europe on a\u00a0single visa \u2013 hence George Osborne&apos;s recent announcement of simplified visas. Only around 200,000 Chinese tourists visited Britain in 2012, while 1.4 million visited France. No effort is being spared to promote British charms. In September, British Airways launched its new direct flight from the Chinese western hub of Chengdu to Heathrow by staging a surprise &quot;Chinese panda flashmob dance&quot; in a Chengdu shopping mall. About 50 people in panda suits were hired to wiggle to disco music against a Union Jack backdrop, including some dressed up as apparently famous British pandas such as David Beckham, Sherlock Holmes and Harry Potter. There was even a panda Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with a baby panda George. Dancing pandas won&apos;t solve everything. Take Barnsley, for example. The South Yorkshire town is the birthplace of James Taylor Hudson, a missionary widely credited with introducing Christianity to China in the 1850s. Some townspeople believe Barnsley could attract millions of Chinese pilgrims \u2013 there are around 70 million Christians in China \u2013 and even become &quot;a new Bethlehem&quot;. In August, however, the Barnsley Chronicle reported that a Beijing woman who came to assess the town&apos;s potential said Chinese investors were &quot;disappointed&quot; with her findings. &quot;Chinese visitors like midnight shopping, karaoke and massage, not bars and drinking,&quot; 58-year-old Mary Lui told the newspaper. &quot;But they can&apos;t find it here in Barnsley.&quot; Lui suggested the town should consider opening a 24-hour shopping centre, an &quot;authentic&quot; Chinese restaurant and a health centre. But who&apos;s to say that Christian-minded Chinese wouldn&apos;t find some redeeming features in Barnsley as it is? What the investors are really complaining about, it seems, is that there aren&apos;t enough big business ventures to make money from an influx of tourists. Wolfgang Georg Arlt of the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute says surveys and web forums inside China repeatedly show that modern tourists are &quot;more open-minded&quot;. Both China and the west, he says, would do well to stop resorting to stereotypes and find out what people really like. One such stereotype is of Chinese tourists as shopping obsessives who buy up the entire contents of luxury boutiques. Many Chinese do buy designer items overseas \u2013 in the coming year they are projected to buy more luxury goods than all other nationalities combined. Along with the usual aspirational love of status symbols, duties of up to 60% on such goods back home partially explain the phenomenon. back in Pattaya, tour guide Angela Wu says shopping is rarely the sole reason for a\u00a0foreign trip. Wu, 45, from Shanghai, is chain-smoking in the lobby of the Miss Tiffany transvestite cabaret show while her tour-group charges watch the evening&apos;s glittering performance. &quot;Most people travel because they want to see something they can&apos;t see in China,&quot; she says. &quot;They&apos;re interested in historical sites and famous art in Europe, and natural scenery in America and Australia.&quot; Pattaya&apos;s spectacular ladyboys are another example of something they can&apos;t see back home. (On one tour group&apos;s itinerary, the Chinese word used to describe them translates as &quot;person-creatures&quot;.) After the show, the sequin-bedecked performers in towering headdresses crowd into the lobby to pose for photographs with tourists for an extra charge of 40 baht (80p) a time. &quot;Please inform management if the artists misbehave,&quot; says a large sign warning about potential overcharging. But on this occasion it&apos;s some of the Chinese men who misbehave by trying to squeeze the ladyboys&apos; breasts during their photo sessions. &quot;They think it&apos;s OK because the breasts are not real,&quot; says Wu wearily. Wu, who has worked as a guide for 20 years within and outside China, says taking her countrymen and women overseas is like &quot;going into battle&quot;. &quot;No decision is ever simple. Everyone has an opinion that must be heard.&quot; But she doesn&apos;t believe that Chinese tourists deserve a wholesale reputation for being badly behaved. Like any nation, she says, &quot;there are polite people and rude people&quot; and most extreme cases of uncouth behaviour are isolated incidents that shouldn&apos;t tarnish all Chinese people. There was outrage in May, for example, when it emerged that a teenage boy from the city of Nanjing had etched his name on a\u00a03,500-year-old stone carving at a Luxor temple in Egypt. While the boy&apos;s parents publicly apologised, Chinese netizens pointed out that China&apos;s ancient Great Wall is covered with western graffiti. Other incidents occur, Wu says, as a result of the acute disorientation that some people experience in alien surroundings. She cites one occasion when she took a group of provincial Chinese tourists to Sydney. &quot;It was winter at home but summer in Australia, so I told them to go into the toilets when we got off the plane to change into light clothing.&quot; When they arrived, Wu found many people stripping down to their underwear at the arrivals gate, in view of other passengers. &quot;They would never do that back in China. People were just confused,&quot; she says. Nevertheless, mindful of the nation&apos;s image overseas, China&apos;s government issued a\u00a064-page Handbook for Civilised Tourism in October containing safety tips and etiquette rules for its citizens abroad. Along with some useful advice, the booklet&apos;s rules include: &quot;Don&apos;t steal the lifejacket from the airplane&quot;, &quot;Don&apos;t leave footprints on toilet seats&quot;, &quot;Don&apos;t take more than you can eat from breakfast buffets&quot; and &quot;Don&apos;t dry your smalls over hotel lampshades&quot;. There are also some country-specific tips, such as warning travellers to the UK that asking British people if they&apos;ve eaten is &quot;deemed impolite&quot;, and advising female tourists to wear earrings while in Spain, otherwise &quot;they will be considered naked&quot;. No wonder some people are confused. Luckily Shun-Wen Tong, the student I met at the top of Pattaya&apos;s observation tower, was not one of them. He emailed me when he returned to Hangzhou to say he had survived his package tour without any dramas. He wasn&apos;t quite as convinced as before that Thailand was &quot;100% a holy country&quot; after visiting a &quot;sex show where ladies shot tropical fruit from their private parts&quot;, but he was impressed at how &quot;spirituality and sexuality happily co-existed&quot;. Most of all, he said, the experience had given him the confidence to arrange his own trips abroad in future. A few days later, Tong sent me a 10,000-word document in both English and Chinese entitled A Journal of My Travels, all about his time in Thailand. &quot;I hope you like it,&quot; he wrote. &quot;This is just the first instalment.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2013-12-22T00:05:07Z", "tags": ["China", "Travel", "Travel & leisure", "Business", "ent and tourismHospitality, event managem", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "China holidays", "Asia", "Thailand holidays"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/dec/22/chinese-tourism-changing-the-world", "title": "Chinese tourism: 'Finally, we are seeing the world'", "sentences": ["The off-season weather is just one of the dodgy things about Pattaya \u2013 a resort known to many as &quot;Thailand&apos;s Blackpool&quot;, it is two hours outside Bangkok \u2013 but Tong is savouring every moment.", "In Thailand, the number of Chinese tourists shot up by 107% this year, nudging Bangkok ahead of London to become the world&apos;s most visited city in Mastercard&apos;s latest survey."]}, {"article": "Russell Brand&apos;s interview by Jeremy Paxman on Newsnight was one of the UK&apos;s 10 most-watched YouTube clips. Like many charismatics, Brand is easily refuted\u00a0in principle, yet hard to argue with while he&apos;s talking. Horizontal politics (non-votey, direct action) versus vertical politics (votey, Westminster) was a running battle all year. Many people\u00a0think politicians are spectacularly bad at negotiating well with corporations, and that&apos;s where the power is. Yet few seriously contend that revolution will be hastened by a total boycott of\u00a0the democratic process. Nevertheless, Brand&apos;s analysis had that sickening familiarity of being punched in a bruise, of being\u00a0told something you know is\u00a0true: &quot;The apathy doesn&apos;t come from us, the people,&quot; he said. &quot;The\u00a0apathy comes\u00a0from politicians. They&apos;re only\u00a0interested in serving corporations.&quot; And even the MPs you don&apos;t think are bent have this about them, a\u00a0desperate clinging to\u00a0what&apos;s &quot;realistic&quot;, a horror at the\u00a0idea of profound change, however broken things are without it. It does look like apathy or, from another angle, the atrophy of terror. It&apos;s hard to see the process whereby, if you ignore politicians, they go away. But it&apos;s hard, too, to see the process by which they rediscover their representative purpose, and fight for the basic principles of decency from which the post-crash world lists so determinedly. Which is all Brand was saying, really (in pr\u00e9cis): &quot;Do you see this lot improving? Because I don&apos;t.&quot; What is quite insulting both to Brand and his fans is the line that this will be the first taste of politics many young people will have had, and \u2013 gasp \u2013 it could undo all the hard work that citizenship classes and civic leaders have put into getting out the youth vote. This inert lump of youth, indifferent to politics because they&apos;re too busy on\u00a0their Xboxes, is a fantasy of the\u00a0political classes. It&apos;s an understandable fantasy, since the alternative is that the true focus of derision is not politics, events or world affairs, but the politicians themselves. Just because MPs&apos; ideas\u00a0fail to ignite does not mean there&apos;s no such thing as fire. If\u00a0the technicolour popularity of Brand tells us anything, it&apos;s that people love politics more than ever.

Least real girlfriend Three days after his girlfriend, Lennay Kekua, died of leukaemia, Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te&apos;o fought through the grief to play the game of his life in leading Notre Dame to a 20-3 victory over Michigan State. Then it emerged Lennay did not actually exist beyond a fake Twitter account, operated by a man who had fallen &quot;deeply romantically in love with Te&apos;o&quot; during a two-year-long hoax. &quot;This is incredibly embarrassing to talk about,&quot; said Te&apos;o in January. Best old-fashioned chairman Mansfield&apos;s John Radford thanked his manager Paul Cox for their 8-1 mauling of\u00a0Barrow in February by giving him his Aston Martin: &quot;It&apos;s my old Aston Martin, so it&apos;s not brand new. It&apos;s a couple of years old,&quot; he said. Cox said: &quot;It&apos;s a bit surreal to be honest.&quot; Worst scallywags When thieves broke into the Garmin-Sharp team truck during the Tour de Mediterranean in February, they stole 17 bikes, wheels and equipment totalling \u20ac250,000, forcing the team to pull out of the race. Team chiropractor Matt Rabin tweeted: &quot;While everyone was sleeping, some unscrupulous local scallywags have gone &amp; pilfered ALL THE BIKES.&quot; David Millar observed that the time-trial bikes were still there: &quot;Scumbags clearly don&apos;t like TTs.&quot; Most awkward moment LaTonya Norton, anchor of WDSU in New Orleans, interviewed Mo Farah after the New Orleans half-marathon in February. Her key questions included: &quot;Haven&apos;t you run before?

It&apos;s very painful&quot;. Best modern football moment When the lights went out at Fulham in February, the electronic advertising hoardings stayed on. Most forgetful driver Mercedes&apos;s Lewis Hamilton surprised McLaren mechanics six laps into March&apos;s Malaysian Grand Prix by pulling into his former team&apos;s box for a pit stop. &quot;I don&apos;t know what happened. The teams look so similar,&quot; he said. &quot;Feel\u00a0free to pop in and say &apos;Hi&apos; any time @lewishamilton,&quot; quipped mechanics on\u00a0Twitter. Best 15 minutes of fame     Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images    Swansea&apos;s ballboy Charlie Morgan, 17: given a tap by Chelsea&apos;s Eden Hazard in January, made an entertaining meal of it. Hazard was sent off, while Morgan had 60,000 Twitter followers within an hour of the incident. In Spain, meanwhile, Loja&apos;s third-tier game against San Fernando was held up in the 77th minute while police removed a five-inch flick knife from a 12-year-old ballboy. Local media said the boy was &quot;trying to worry&quot; a linesman with the knife, but &quot;never intended to hurt anyone&quot;. Best Sliding Doors moment  At 4.48pm on 28 April, Marcello Trotta stood over a penalty for Brentford against Doncaster. It was the last minute of the last game of a 46-match season. In one universe he would score it and Uwe R\u00f6sler&apos;s side would be promoted to the Championship for the first time since 1993. In a parallel universe he would miss it and Doncaster would go up while Brentford would be beaten by Yeovil in the play-off final, remain in League One and lose R\u00f6sler to Wigan seven months later. Trotta hit the crossbar. Saddest story In April, Brazilian club Ji-Paran\u00e1 secretly replaced their regular lucky mascot, a\u00a0rooster called Tissoka, after an anaconda ate him. Local media said the incident, at owner Marambaia&apos;s farm, was initially kept quiet, but fans became suspicious when the replacement bird looked &quot;shy and flappy&quot; \u2013 &quot;whereas Tissoka was famously relaxed and used to\u00a0crow during goal celebrations&quot;. Marambaia said: &quot;It&apos;s sad. But this new bird will step up, given time. He just needs to find some composure.&quot; Clearest clarification &quot;I&apos;ll just reiterate for a lot of the buffoons tweeting me. I WILL NOT BE PLAYING IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP NEXT SEASON. Hope that clears that up,&quot; tweeted Joey Barton in May. Last week, he\u00a0played his 20th game of the season for QPR \u2026 in the Championship. Biggest non-scoop  ITV&apos;s Gabriel Clarke was on the verge of a major exclusive when interviewing a rueful, yet talkative, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho after Real Madrid&apos;s Champions League exit at the hands of Borussia Dortmund. He was also on the verge of the News at Ten. \u25a0 Clarke: Many commiserations tonight. Maybe next season with Real? \u25a0 Mourinho: Maybe not. \u25a0 Clarke: Where? \u25a0 Mourinho: You know ... I want to be where \u2026 I love to be where people love me to be \u2026 \u25a0 Clarke: We&apos;ll take that as England, I&apos;ve got to go. \u25a0 Adrian Chiles: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho with the last word. That&apos;s it from us in Madrid. Good evening. Worst mind games Efforts to unsettle Crystal Palace ahead of their Championship play-offs semi-final second leg at Brighton in May \u2013 from the cardboard clappers handed to fans by the hosts&apos; marketing department (&quot;silly and annoying&quot;, said Gus Poyet) and the Palace coach driver being sent the wrong way, to the year&apos;s defining dressing-room faecal atrocity. Poyet said in a subsequent letter to staff: &quot;Someone did something terrible \u2026 all outside the toilets, over and around the toilets. Did they imagine that this would affect the Crystal Palace players? Well, possibly it did. It may just have fired them up.&quot; Palace won; Poyet left days later. Least-necessary apology 2 June: The Premier League apologises to Chelsea after its official website publishes a story headlined: &quot;Jos\u00e9 Mourinho makes Chelsea return. Portuguese coach is back at Stamford Bridge after signing a xx-year contract.&quot; \u2013 &quot;We have no prior knowledge of any movement or any announcement.&quot; 3 June: Chelsea announce Mourinho is back at Stamford Bridge after signing a four-year contract. Finest interview With his appointment as Newcastle&apos;s director of football yet to be rubber-stamped, Joe &quot;JFK&quot; Kinnear appeared on TalkSport in June to defend his record. He claimed responsibility for signing Tim Krul (recruited by Graeme Souness) and James Perch (bought by Chris Hughton); said &quot;Derek Llambezee&quot; (Derek Llambias, Newcastle&apos;s managing director) had resigned as director of football (a position he had never held); and discussed Shola Amenobee, Hatem Ben Afre and Yohan Kebab. His keynote claim \u2013 that he had been manager of the year three times \u2013 was undercut by the fact he had won the award once. Newcastle confirmed his appointment the following day.

Photograph: Alex Morton/Action Images    Modern-day Stoke fans\u00a0welcome their\u00a0team with the\u00a0gentle hum of the\u00a021st-century alternative. Toughest first day As the peloton surged towards Bastia on the first day of the Tour de France in June, Garikoitz Atxa was driving the Orica-GreenEdge team bus across the finishing line \u2013 where it got stuck. A few minutes later, Tour organisers frantically switched the finish to the three-kilometre line up the road. Then, with air let out of its tyres, the bus started reversing \u2013 and the finish was switched back to its original spot near Bastia beach. As the riders kept adjusting to changing information about the race climax there was a mass crash. &quot;This was my first day driving the bus so it&apos;s not a good start,&quot; said Atxa . &quot;But I hope they have faith in me.&quot; Worst button-pressing When an Edgbaston gust blew a bail off during June&apos;s Champions Trophy match between England and Australia, the third umpire, Billy Bowden, dutifully checked that batsman Ravi Bopara had not dislodged it. But Bowden accidentally pressed the wrong button, pronouncing him on the giant screen &quot;Out&quot;. It had to be hastily reversed, to huge cheers. Best concentration Lions squad member Christian Wade used his appearance on the big screen as a chance to comb his hair during the pivotal third Test. Most missed James Alexander Gordon retired because of ill health in July after four decades of reading the BBC&apos;s classified results: his sing-song inflexion will never be bettered. He described his style in 2008. &quot;I play the clarinet and the piano, and I thought, &apos;How can I make this like a song?&apos; I just gave it a bit of a lilt.&apos;&apos; In better news, Charlotte Green was an inspired choice as replacement. Biggest worrier  While Joe Root was compiling 180 against Australia at Lord&apos;s in July, brother Billy was on duty as England 12th man. &quot;I was shaking, more nervous than he was,&quot; Billy said. &quot;He&apos;s chilled out. I don&apos;t know how he&apos;s so calm. I took him his drink and he was cracking jokes.&quot; Tightest bonding A month into his contract, Gavin Henson joined his Bath team-mates at the city&apos;s Pig and Fiddle pub in July for a bonding session. CCTV footage soon appeared, apparently showing him floored by a punch from No8 Carl Fearns. &quot;I like to think the squad grew closer together after\u00a0that,&quot; Henson said.

Least surprising highlights The BBC cheerily announced during its Wimbledon coverage that Lewis Hamilton had taken pole at July&apos;s German Grand Prix. Then it broadcast its F1 highlights programme. Seven hundred viewers, who had planned to watch the highlights &quot;as live&quot;, complained. &quot;We apologise for this error and that it affected some viewers&apos; enjoyment of our qualifying highlights programme.&quot; Sharpest reverse Thailand&apos;s Thongchai Jaidee made the Open cut at Muirfield in July \u2013 a fact he learned while he was in Terminal 3 at Heathrow trying to fly back to Bangkok, having decided his eight-over score of 150 would not be enough. &quot;At about 8.45pm I was told that I had a seat in business class and I thought, &apos;Wow, I&apos;m lucky&apos;. Then my manager told me I made the cut.&quot; Jaidee scrambled a flight north and teed off at 9.10am. He carded an impressive par 71.

It was a hard time, stressful and I had to focus.&quot; Worst set of priorities In August, the new US Premier League broadcaster NBC interrupted live coverage of Palace versus Sunderland for Barack Obama&apos;s address to the nation on the prospect of bombing Syria.

Lots of love.&quot; Best broadcast          Sky Sports&apos; Nick Collins was broadcasting live outside Wembley on Sky Sports News before England&apos;s August friendly against Scotland. Discussing Michael Carrick, he said: &quot;He was man of the match here at the Community Shield game \u2026&quot; then fell off his ladder. An instant YouTube sensation. Worst camouflage Luca De Pra, a youth-team coach for Genoa, was caught in full camouflage gear hiding in a bush to spy on local rivals\u00a0Sampdoria before their derby match in September. Genoa said he was &quot;acting entirely alone&quot; and suspended him, while Sampdoria&apos;s statement was more colourful, comparing him to &quot;Rambo hidden among the branches on the hill&quot;.

Young&apos;s rash of yellow cards for increasingly creative and\u00a0complex diving followed 2012&apos;s much-requoted-back-at-him pledge: &quot;I&apos;m not a cheat, I&apos;m not a diver. I play football fairly.&quot; Best shopping Whyteleafe manager John Fowler &quot;bombed it&quot; to the shops in Margate to buy his side a new strip when they turned up for their Southern Counties East League game at Canterbury in October with only their badly clashing home kit. Given a 30-minute deadline, he made it back at 3.29pm. &quot;The players were on the pitch in their underpants and shinpads, so we threw the kit at them.&quot; But the referee called the game off due to the players not being warmed up. A week later in Colombia, Independiente Santa Fe solved the same problem in their match against Boyac\u00e1 Chic\u00f3 by buying a set of counterfeit tops from a street vendor and drawing numbers on the back in red marker pen. Most embarrassing mother Cristiano Ronaldo&apos;s mother, Dolores Aveiro, told a new book in October just how much he has changed over the years: &quot;As a boy he would get angry and cry easily if other boys didn&apos;t pass him the ball, or because they did not play as he wanted. They called him cry baby.&quot; Best hospital-based puns Leytonstone&apos;s Whipps Cross \u2013 a name destined to produce top wingers \u2013 made (bad) headlines in October when it emerged that England&apos;s new cross-whipping ace Andros Townsend was born there, 16 years after David Beckham. Best shark-jumping Adnan Januzaj&apos;s Roy of the Rovers impact in October had David Moyes feeling better about life. Briefly. Januzaj was, Moyes revealed, a &quot;top, top player&quot; \u2013 a Harry Redknapp-coined phrase that finally jumped the shark in 2013 when Brendan Rodgers and Sir Alex Ferguson disagreed over Steven Gerrard&apos;s qualities. Sir Alex said he wasn&apos;t &quot;top, top&quot;; Rodgers said he was &quot;top, top, top, top, top&quot;. Earlier in the year, Bayern&apos;s Pep Guardiola had taken the theme on a level while road-testing his command of German \u2013 calling Arjen Robben &quot;ein top-top-top spieler&quot;. Worst try attempt In their Rugby League World Cup opener at Warrington in October, Kiwi Sonny Bill Williams split the Samoan defence and raced over the line. There were no Samoans near him and he casually strode deep into the in-goal area \u2013 before slipping over and putting a foot into touch before he could ground the ball. No try. Roughest justice In October, Turf Moor&apos;s mascot Bertie Bee offered a linesman his glasses after a tight call and was sent off by the referee. A\u00a0leaked photo showed Mr Bee cooling off in the stadium&apos;s secure holding area: a\u00a0rough day for anthropomorphic marketing tools everywhere. Finest PR moment The surest sign of winter&apos;s arrival came in October: the Premier League&apos;s winter ball making its seasonal debut. Nike said this year&apos;s Incyte ball features &quot;Nike RaDaR (Rapid Decision and Response) technology to maximise visibility.&quot; Translation: it&apos;s yellow.

Longest journey Derby&apos;s Andre Wisdom had to abandon his \u00a3100,000 Porsche in a mud-filled hollow six miles from Pride Park in November after his satnav led him astray on his way to play against Sheffield Wednesday. Passerby Pete Irons said: &quot;We are miles from any main road and the track doesn&apos;t go anywhere. It&apos;s mind-boggling how he ended up there.&quot; Worst-dressed interviewee            England&apos;s Sam Burgess gave his shorts to a smitten female fan after the Rugby League World Cup win over France in November. While being interviewed in the tunnel in his underpants, he was shown footage of what happened next. &quot;She looks quite happy! I hope she doesn&apos;t smell them ... Oh\u00a0... she smells them doesn&apos;t she.

Most sheepish  New sports minister and Maidstone MP Helen Grant was tossed some questions by a Meridian TV crew in November. Who is the Wimbledon women&apos;s champion? &quot;Oooh, err. It&apos;s not one of ours. But I know Andy Murray did it for us, which was absolutely fantastic. That&apos;s the most important thing.&quot; Who are the FA Cup holders? &quot;Come on, help. Manchester United \u2013 because it&apos;s my favourite club.&quot; Who is the England rugby union captain? &quot;Yeah, what about hockey?&quot; Which year did Maidstone United leave the football league? &quot;Last year.&quot; Which Paralympian won most medals at London 2012? &quot;Dave Weir.&quot; (Marion Bartoli, Wigan, Chris Robshaw, 1992, Jacqueline Freney) Most generous offer After the referee in Altrincham&apos;s Skrill North game at Colwyn Bay was injured with no reserve ref available, an appeal was made over the PA for a replacement.

Best preparation England&apos;s cricket team sent an 82-page list of catering demands to Australian Test grounds before flying in for the Ashes. The 194 types of meal and beverage included quinoa with roasted butternut squash, apricot and parsley, piri-piri breaded tofu with tomato salsa and mungbean curry with spinach. Australia won the first three Tests by 381, 218 and 150 runs. Swiftest U-turns Before the World Cup draw: \u25a0 Roy Hodgson: &quot;Manaus is the place ideally to avoid \u2026 a difficult venue for everyone.&quot; \u25a0 Mayor Arthur Virgilio: &quot;We would also prefer that England doesn&apos;t come. We hope to get a better team and a coach who is more sensible and polite.&quot; After the draw: \u25a0 Hodgson: &quot;I have always actually wanted to go to Manaus. To suggest that we don&apos;t want to go there or show a lack of respect is complete nonsense.&quot; \u25a0 Leonardo Novellino of the mayor&apos;s office: &quot;We will welcome them with warmth, good food and parties.&quot; Best pre-match fun Before Gloucester v Worcester fans vied to propel 10ft rugby balls over one of the crossbars.

The wider context for their thoughts, as with all aspects of London&apos;s evolution over the next couple of decades, is the need to provide a bigger and better service at the same time as national government is providing less of the money required to pay for it.  Stephen Colebourne, who writes the UK Rail blog, puts it succinctly:   The elephant in the room for transport in London is the growth of population and the resultant increase in population density. Transport for London boasts that Crossrail will add 10% to London&apos;s transport capacity, but London&apos;s population is growing faster. The urgent need for another one or two new Crossrail lines should not be underestimated.  This view is not out of line with Sir Peter Hendy&apos;s comments at the Transport Times London Transport Awards night back in May, when, stressing the need for a long-term funding programme beyond 2015, he predicted that when Crossrail opens in 2018 &quot;it will be immediately full&quot; and that every transport network will be under &quot;increasing strain&quot; before the end of this decade. You can read more from Stephen on the galloping growth in demand for all rail services in London here.  Meanwhile at London Reconnections contributor Pedantic of Purley has been tracking the progress of TfL&apos;s upgrade programme against the plan published in February 2011. His verdict? &quot;It really must, in all reality, be considered dead.&quot; Upgrade work hasn&apos;t suddenly ceased, of course, but, argues Pedantic: &quot;What seems to have happened is that the plan has been substantially deferred and altered.&quot; Why? &quot;The heart of the problem seems to have been money.&quot;  Pedantic goes on to cast doubt on predictions by transport chiefs, first made last year, that London Underground would never again order a Tube train for with a cab for a driver at the front.  The hope and belief clearly was that development and delivery of the new generation deep-level tube trains would mean that trains would be specified without a driver&apos;s cab. This would apply to all future train orders. The problem was that [what has come to be called the] New Tube for London is a major technical advancement over what we currently have, and the idea that the necessary development, placing of orders and delivery could be achieved in the timescales required ultimately turned out to be quite unrealistic, no matter how good the intention. In particular the emerging need for delivery of new trains on both the Northern Line by 2020 and the Jubilee Line by 2018 (to support extenstions and upgrades there) coupled with virtually no flexibility available to move stock around between different lines means that never ordering a train again without a driver&apos;s cab simply wasn&apos;t going to happen.  The politically-convenient fantasy that Boris Johnson will fatally weaken the Tube unions by bringing in &quot;driverless trains&quot; has therefore, according to this account, become even further divorced from reality. Even Johnson acknowledges that in any &quot;driverless&quot; future Tube trains will still be staffed, and no one anticipates those staff being prevented from joining unions. As one of the Underground&apos;s most senior bosses told me earlier this year, the gap between management and Bob Crow on this aspect of the connection between staffing and passenger safety is pretty small.  The full London Reconnections piece looks at the improvements likely to occur (and otherwise) on the Bakerloo, Jubilee, Central, Victoria, Northern and Waterloo and City lines (with the Piccadilly to be examined separately soon). A further end-of-year article examines plans for the sub-surface lines. No gathering of Tube writers would be complete without a contribution from Annie Mole, whose blog Going Underground captures the colour and culture of Tube travel so vividly. I asked her for her thoughts on what the Underground should and might be like in the future. She obliged as follows.  From the original 3.75 mile line and six stations to a system with 250 miles and 270 stations, the London Underground is much more than an enormous people-mover, it&apos;s an icon of London. Classless, constantly changing, at times clunky and often showing its Victorian heritage, is it finally getting the respect it deserves? Upgrading the Underground after years of underinvestment is a massive challenge for all involved.  When looking at futuristic cities science fiction writers often imagine more monorail systems - the space above our heads rather than below our feet comes into its own. Why don&apos;t we take to the skies rather than tunnel deeper underground? I predict that we will eventually see a more overground Underground.  I&apos;ve travelled on the elevated Skytrain in Bangkok. It&apos;s efficient, cool, airy, light and a huge contrast to the super busy hot and frantic congested Bangkok streets. The idea of taking an elevated train over London&apos;s West End excites me. A monorail running over Regent Street was proposed by the GLC some 45 years ago in a bid to ease congestion.  Will we ever see more elevation than the current cable car across the Thames? Or should the Underground remain underground, even though currently 55% of the Tube system is actually on the surface? What percentage of trains should run underground for the system to still be called the London Underground? Perhaps it&apos;s time for the London OverUnderground to come into its own.  Finally, here&apos;s an extract from a piece written early this year by Christian Wolmar, the distinguished transport commentator, author of The Subterranean Railway and Labour mayoral hopeful. Though marking the 150th anniversary of the Tube, Christian also had an eye on the future.   The Underground...has been a civilising influence [on London] even though people understandably have no affection for it when they are they are squeezed, nose to armpit, into the cramped trains. However, that is the result of the system&apos;s very success but also, sadly, the failure to understand its value by successive generations of politicians who withheld money to invest in the system. Remarkably, in London, by 1907, all but two of the current Tube lines had opened all built by private companies. Then, however, as funding became the responsibility of government because of the rising costs, the opportunity to build on that situation was missed. Consequently, in the following 62 years, there were only extensions into the suburbs rather than any additions to the network in central London. Indeed, even the two more recent additions, the Victoria (opened in 1969) and the Jubilee (1979 and 2000) had no new stations within the central London bounded by the Circle Line. That means there are still significant areas of central London that have no Tube such as Chelsea and Fleet Street, and in effect London is short of a couple of lines. And again, the sceptics are being allowed to dominate the debate. Sure, Crossrail, the new tunnel under London linking Liverpool Street and Paddington stations, will be completed by the end of the decade and it will be built to a very high standard with fantastic stations, but it took 50 years from drawing board to construction. Worse, there is nothing definite on the stocks. There is vague talk of a Crossrail 2, the old Chelsea to Hackney plan, but the Mayor, Boris Johnson, has been slow to work up plans for any major new lines, concentrating, instead, on the rather minor extension from Kennington to Battersea which, it is hoped, will be largely developer-funded. Places like Streatham, Camberwell and Harlesden, ripe for tube extensions or new lines, will remain off the wonderful Harry Beck map seemingly forever. London, therefore, is still suffering from the failure of imagination that has dogged the history of this great invention in its homeland. The politicians are always looking at &quot;business cases&quot; or suggesting new lines &quot;need to pay their way&quot; when, in fact, it is so obvious that a healthy and growing Underground is the very basis for a health and growing London economy. Even 150 after years of success and worldwide imitation, that lesson has still to be learned.  Christian&apos;s full article can be read here.
