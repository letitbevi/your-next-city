It was a Harold Pinter play, so I was expecting a rough night, and a horrible time of year, so ditto. But even allowing for these things, it struck me afresh that, with the exception of flying, there is no cost to discomfort ratio more out of whack for the consumer than the Broadway experience. Americans are not, by and large, known for their docility in the face of poor customer service. (I was reminded of this during the big freeze this week, when American friends whose apartments dipped below 70F effectively threatened their landlords with arrest. In Britain, you put another sweater on and warm your hands over a pyre of burning resentment). So how theatres in New York get away with it is interesting.  It is partly to do with one&apos;s pliability in the face of long-held prejudices. Tickets on Broadway cost more than a flight to Miami and deliver the comfort of a middle-row seat in economy to Bangkok, but it doesn&apos;t matter; Broadway is the last bastion of a certain kind of thinking, which is: if it hurts, it must be working. For many of us, going to the theatre is still bound by notions leftover from school that art is occurring and we&apos;d better knuckle down and enjoy it, or else. If it&apos;s uncomfortable, all the better, and everything is set up to encourage this mindset: making you wait outside the theatre, no matter the weather, until the last possible moment.  Even in the West End, where the seats are as small but the tickets at least cheaper, you&apos;re allowed to mill in the foyer long before showtime \u2013 and then marshaling you brusquely across the threshold, past the bar where you can drop $20 for a gin and tonic and on to your seat, where, getting up to let others pass, you threaten to pitch forward into oblivion, never to return. (Unless you&apos;re in the expensive seats, where all you suffer is the indignity of a chest or knee bump with the person you&apos;ll be listening to breath for the next two hours.) At the end of the performance, you are chucked out a side-door into an alley by the dumpster. It&apos;s a metaphor for something, I&apos;m sure. And I know you can&apos;t blame the theatre for the behaviour of the audience. At the Pinter, coughing reached tuberculosis-ward levels and a woman a few seats down from us maintained, throughout the performance, a stage whisper describing the action to the man she was sitting with. (&quot;He&apos;s walking to the drinks cabinet. Ian McKellen is leaving the room. The other man is crawling on the floor. He&apos;s come back in in his pajamas.&quot;) Her companion was blind, but it was hard to believe that he wasn&apos;t, like the rest of us, overcoming violent impulses to make her stop. The odd thing is that these conditions persist in an age when all forms of entertainment are subject to such fierce competition. As the tech expo, CES, has been demonstrating this week, the sophistication of home entertainment is such that it is a wonder any of us ever leaves the house. Even going to the movies, at $20 a shot, looks increasingly unappealing in the face of new 4S screen technology: &quot;four times sharper than HD&quot;, say the releases, which Netflix among others will be filming in this year and will presumably make reality look like a shabby also-ran. In such a climate, you would think theatres would make an effort to coddle their patrons, but perhaps they know something we don&apos;t. There is no accounting for how and why people behave the way they do, which is why economic forecasting is always being upended by perverse spending habits. When you pay $180 for a ticket, you have to enjoy yourself, or you&apos;re an idiot, right? (Am I enjoying this? How much am I enjoying this? OK, I am definitely enjoying this. A lot.) Satisfaction is to some extent guaranteed, hence the uniform standing ovations on Broadway, no matter how lukewarm the play. None of which is to denigrate live performing. You are paying for the frisson that comes from the possibility of error, and for the ineffable sense that you are experiencing something that can&apos;t be captured, repeated or manipulated. You are also, perhaps, paying for that rare sense of collective propriety that makes, say, looking at your phone impossible. Oh, and the fact that when it&apos;s good at the theatre, it&apos;s better than anything. You will put up with a lot of unaugmented reality, for that.", "publicationDate": "2014-01-10T14:00:00Z", "tags": ["Broadway", "Theatre", "US news", "Netflix", "World news", "US theater"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/emma-brockes-blog/2014/jan/10/broadway-business-model-pain-still-pleasurable", "title": "Broadway's clever business model: painful can still be pleasurable | Emma Brockes", "sentences": ["Tickets on Broadway cost more than a flight to Miami and deliver the comfort of a middle-row seat in economy to Bangkok, but it doesn&apos;t matter; Broadway is the last bastion of a certain kind of thinking, which is: if it hurts, it must be working."]}, {"article": "The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) has called on the authorities in Thailand to allow journalists reporting in the country to import and use body armour.

Police and soldiers maintained a low profile as the &quot;shutdown Bangkok&quot; drive got under way in Thailand&apos;s capital. The mood was festive, with many protesters singing and dancing in the streets.  Led by former deputy premier Suthep Thaugsuban, thousands of protesters have set up permanent barricades and encampments at seven sites across the city. Major intersections that normally teem with cars and trucks are blockaded, but city trains and river ferries have been operating, most shops are open and motorbikes have plied the roads freely.  &quot;Don&apos;t ask me how long this occupation will last,&quot; Thaugsuban said in a speech to supporters carried by the movement&apos;s BlueSky television channel. &quot;We will not stop until we win.&quot;  Suthep \u2013 a career politician who has led the People&apos;s Democratic Reform Committee against Yingluck Shinawatra&apos;s government for the past two months in a bid to rid the country of corruption - has threatened to shut down Bangkok for up to 20 days in order to replace Yingluck&apos;s caretaker government with an unelected people&apos;s council. This so-called Bangkok shutdown is the latest move by Suthep and his largely urban, elite followers, who have been calling since November for an end to the &quot;Thaksin regime&quot; \u2013 a reference to Yingluck&apos;s brother and former prime minister Thaksin, a hugely divisive leader who won over poor northern farmers with his rice subsidy and healthcare schemes, but fell foul of Bangkok&apos;s elite, who hated the telecoms tycoon&apos;s cronyism and money politics. Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and now lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai to avoid corruption charges. Yet he is considered to be the man pulling the strings behind the current government, and any new elections \u2013 such as those most recently called for 2 February, which the opposition Democrat party has already boycotted \u2013 will more than likely see a return of the popular Pheu Thai party to power. Yingluck on Monday invited leaders of anti-government protesters and political parties to discuss a proposal to push back the date of the election. Ministers have until now said a delay would be impossible under the constitution, but the Election Commission has said it could be pushed back and one member has suggested 4 May.  Suthep, who served as deputy PM after Thaksin was ousted, has called the shutdown the protesters&apos; last battle \u2013 a term he has admittedly used multiple times before \u2013 but vowed in an interview on Sunday that it would be non-violent and to call off his protest if civil war were instigated. Yet violence remains a real threat, with businesses grounding employees and embassies worried about a return of the 2011 rioting that saw storefronts burned to the ground, 100 people killed and about 2,000 injured during similar anti-government protests. Even army commander General Prayuth Chan-ocha has not ruled out the possibility of a military coup, and 10,000 police and 8,000 soldiers have been deployed to maintain security across the city.

The Belgian is blossoming. The journey to this point has not been straightforward. Mourinho had warned in pre-season that he was &quot;not the kind of guy who makes life easy for the great players&quot;, his intention made public to ensure his most talented players employed their qualities to hoist those of the collective, and he has been true to his word. There were times this season when Hazard would wince at the constant ear-bashing administered from the technical area during games, all bellowed reminders of defensive duties and the need to track back and support his full-back. That same message has been drummed into him through daily training sessions. A player once prone to laughing and joking through drills was quickly made to realise a change of attitude was required if he was to thrive under the new regime. Mourinho has acknowledged the player he had targeted for Real Madrid in 2011 and inherited at Chelsea in 2013 would initially coast through sessions, trusting in his natural ability &quot;so not at top-concentration or looking to improve&quot;. Such an approach was unacceptable. &quot;But at this moment he&apos;s completely different, always working to improve,&quot; said the manager. He is deemed &quot;professional&quot; these days. The Portuguese had sought evidence of new-found maturity and the 23-year-old has responded. The reprimand for returning late from Lille in November \u2013 he had mislaid his passport after attending his former club&apos;s victory over Monaco \u2013 which saw him dropped for the Champions League group game against Schalke has been pinpointed as a turning point, though the penny had dropped before then. There had been regular conversations, analysis and feedback sessions, constant suggestions and words of advice one on one, Mourinho added, &quot;to show him the right way, or at least the way he has to follow&quot;. Last year the \u00a332m signing started with a flurry and ended with a flourish, enduring a mid-season lull when the physical demands of the English game appeared to grind him down. The breather afforded him by the three-match ban for his altercation with a ballboy at Swansea City a year ago actually proved beneficial. This year has been about steady improvement with the aim to achieve a higher level of consistency throughout each individual contest, ensuring he is as much a threat in the opening exchanges against organised and fresh opponents as he is capable of running riot against tired opponents who may be chasing a game late-on. Three goals in five games, and mesmeric displays such as that at Sunderland in December, have illuminated Chelsea&apos;s recent campaign. Only Wayne Rooney (19) can claim more Premier League assists than Hazard&apos;s 16 since the latter&apos;s arrival in English football. The raw statistics demonstrate improvement: he already has as many league goals this season, nine, as he managed in his first campaign with shot accuracy (from 60% to 67%) and chance-conversion rate (21% to 33%) raised. There is greater involvement, with more successful dribbles (54%) and an impressive number of key passes for a player who has been granted more licence to cut inside from the flank or even revel as a No10 \u2013 which might reflect the drop in the number of crosses \u2013 under this regime, with his credentials preferred to those of Juan Mata. His contributions make real and prolonged impact these days, his threat omnipresent rather than flaring then fizzling out. &quot;There are times when I disappear out of the match, so I&apos;m hoping to improve my work rate and get more consistency,&quot; he acknowledged last month. &quot;There will be matches when I don&apos;t do so well, and matches when I am exceptional.&quot; When Chelsea labour, and they have threatened to stall at times, he invariably supplies that dash of brilliance to make the difference. If the attacking data marks out a more imposing second season then the defensive numbers actually suggest plateau, though witnessing his displays first-hand provides evidence of a willingness to track back and support either Branislav Ivanovic, C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta or Ashley Cole at his back. As Mata experienced early on, Mourinho was never likely to accept anything else. The player comprehends better which areas in which he is expected to provide cover, and where the onus is upon him to close opponents down. Nemanja Matic&apos;s arrival from Benfica may actually liberate Hazard from some of those defensive duties, offering him more freedom to concentrate on picking apart opponents, but the sense of responsibility will never recede. It is in the development of key players where Chelsea&apos;s evolution can be properly measured. The lineup employed by Mourinho over recent weeks has hardly varied dramatically from that selected by Rafael Ben\u00edtez towards the end of last season. Indeed, nine of the 11 who featured in last Saturday&apos;s win at Hull, an occasion graced by a wonderful Hazard opener, had started the key 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur under the interim manager on 8 May. David Luiz began both fixtures in central midfield, with only Ivanovic and Mata absent at the KC Stadium from the team who collided with Spurs. Yet, if the team seems familiar, the Belgian is a changed man even from the player who finished last term with that eye-catching burst of form \u2013 before his hamstring twanged. Perhaps Mata, in the manager&apos;s eyes, does not have the same stamina, stocky strength or speed across the turf. Maybe, as a World Cup, European Championship and Champions League winner, the older man cannot be moulded in the same way. In contrast, Hazard seems as integral to Chelsea now as he once did to Lille. Standards must continue to improve, a pressurised title pursuit sharpening his focus, but his trajectory reflects that of this team. There is plenty more to come.", "publicationDate": "2014-01-17T22:00:00Z", "tags": ["Eden Hazard", "Chelsea", "Football", "Sport", "Lille", "Belgium"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jan/17/eden-hazard-chelsea-jose-mourinho", "title": "Eden Hazard begins to make a big difference for Chelsea | Dominic Fifield", "sentences": ["The intent had been laid bare in a post-training session at Bangkok&apos;s International School last July, even if Eden Hazard might not have envisaged quite how Jos\u00e9 Mourinho would go about progressing his development."]}, {"article": "In an age when it&apos;s possible to get a box of chips and three deep-fried wings from a chicken shop for 99p, it barely needs saying that cheap is not the same as good. It probably is worth saying, however, that cheap is also not always the same as good value. Of course, value can be in the eye of the beholder. It&apos;s all about what you regard as a good return for the money spent. And it&apos;s all about how much money you have to spend in the first place. If a best restaurant list is a cue for a row, a best value restaurant list is that same row squared. So let me set the terms for this very personal, completely unranked list of great value eating opportunities. Some really are cheap. The pho at Cafe East in Surrey Quays, the roast meats at New Sum Ye in Birmingham, come in at less than a tenner. Others cost much more but should still be classed as great value. To access them, however, you have to be flexible. If you want to experience Le Gavroche, you will have to skive off work and go there at lunchtime. Is it worth it for the full experience at a third of the cost? Yes. This applies to many big-ticket places. Most restaurants make their big money in the evenings, but need a bit of footfall during the day to keep the lights on. So do some research. Plan ahead. Save up. You may have other tips for great value eating opportunities in Britain; these are mine. 1: Magpie Cafe, Whitby, North Yorkshire: \u00a312.50 a head     Fish and Chips at The Magpie Cafe in Whitby.

You can have most of the ingredients anyway you want them; there are even signs on the wall telling you which fishing boat landed the langoustine on offer that day. What&apos;s hilarious about all this is that all those people who queue out the door of the 70-year-old Magpie go there for one thing: fish and chips. Rightly so, because it&apos;s about as good as it gets. Even the small portion of golden battered cod and chips brings something the size of a Venetian gondola for \u00a39.95.

Certainly it doesn&apos;t look like the place for a bargain, but that&apos;s exactly what it is. Brasserie Z\u00e9del is a loving take on the classic Parisian brasserie from Jeremy King and Chris Corbin, the men behind the flashy Wolseley. But this is a volume operation which, doing more than 1,000 covers a day, manages to keep prices down for quality by-the-book French food. How about \u00a32.25 for the pumpkin soup? Or \u00a33.25 for the celeriac remoulade? Best of all is the three-course prix fixe at \u00a311.75 for carrot crudites, followed by steak hach\u00e9 and chips with pepper sauce and a pear tart to finish. All that and the ceiling too.

Restaurateur Dave Ramsden knows the city, and caters exceptionally well for his flock, some of whom do not have deep pockets but want both quality and a place to linger. The day menu from 12 until 4 includes a big soup at \u00a34.50, kedgeree at \u00a36.45, and a chicken and tarragon pie at \u00a36.95.

Which makes the lunchtime deal at the Manchester branch of the Abode hotel chain, where Caines runs the sleek restaurant, an absolute steal. It&apos;s \u00a314.50 for two courses, or \u00a319.50 for three, for food that never feels like the bargain basement option. The menu might include a perfectly made chicken terrine, with crisp chicken skin and a caesar salad, lamb breast with a tagine puree, grilled vegetables and couscous and a dark-chocolate and passion\u00a0fruit fondant to finish. The non\u2011meat options \u2013 a spring salad of broccoli and artichokes, a lavender baked onion tart fine \u2013 are none too shabby either. They also offer a wine flight, which probably works out at even better value: a different glass with all three courses comes in at \u00a332.50.

Photograph: Katherine Rose for Observer Food Monthly    With outposts of Wahaca and Brindisa arriving soon, the food scene in Brixton has become politicised of late. Then again it has always been thus. Brixton is a complex neighbourhood. The development of small, relatively cheap restaurants in the two covered markets \u2013 Brixton Village and Market Row \u2013 is simultaneously regarded as a great thing for the area and a blight, dragging in too many moneyed outsiders and ramping up rents. Many claim it isn&apos;t what it once was. I&apos;m not sure it was ever what they say it once was. Regardless, it remains home to some terrific good-value eating opportunities: try the fresh Beijing dumplings at Mama Lan&apos;s, at \u00a34.50 a pop. There&apos;s Kaosarn&apos;s super spicy Bangkok-style noodle soup at \u00a37.90, or a sizable portion of the addictive chilli chicken wings at The Joint, yours for \u00a33.50. There&apos;s Honest Burger, which, although prices have increased, still delivers good value, and the original Franco Manca where their wood-fired tomato, mozzarella and basil pizza is just \u00a35.90.

Photograph: Antonio Olmos for Observer Food Monthly    The restaurant at Bristol&apos;s renovated Lido has a wood-fired oven and, boy, are they going to use it. Most ingredients on the Mediterranean-inspired menu spend a bit of time in there. General prices are not high for ingredients and cooking of this quality. But there are also real bargains. The set menu at lunch and early evening offers two courses for \u00a316 and three for \u00a320 and doesn&apos;t stint on ingredients: it could include scallops, venison and hake. There&apos;s also a very appealing tapas menu with most dishes at between \u00a33 and \u00a36.50. All this plus you get to watch people exert themselves in the pool while you eat.

At night the cooking, served in the green and red dining room with every formal bell and whistle, can swiftly sprint past the \u00a3100 a head mark, for Michel Roux Jr classics such as the souffl\u00e9 suisse or grilled dover sole on the bone with langoustines. But at lunchtime it harbours a secret: the all-inclusive &quot;business lunch menu&quot;. This isn&apos;t merely three courses of grand French cooking \u2013 pork rillettes, followed by steak with red wine sauce or roasted guinea fowl with creamed polenta \u2013 but canapes, petits fours and half a bottle of both mineral water and wine. Given the size and depth of the Gavroche cellar, assembled by Michel&apos;s dad Albert, it is always very good wine. The price: \u00a354 a head. Throw in a tip and it&apos;s \u00a3120 for two all in. No, not cheap, but extraordinary value for what you get, which really is the full Gavroche experience.

There are only three or four Cantonese cafes on the small precinct across from the Bullring but many agree the best is New Sum Ye. It&apos;s not a looker: think wipe-down tables, and blaring TV screens. There is a longer menu but the Cantonese roasts really are the point. Order up a plate of their three roast meats \u2013 lacquered duck, crisp skinned pork belly and bright red char sui \u2013 on a pillow of rice with a little bok choi and you&apos;ll be happy.

The Green Man and French Horn on St Martin&apos;s Lane, part of the small group that includes Terroirs, Brawn and Soif, takes its inspiration from the Loire river, from the undulating Ardeche to the seafood at Saint Nazaire. Most of the dishes are well priced, but none more so than those on the pre-theatre menu, which actually runs from noon to 7pm. Two courses are \u00a314.50 and three are \u00a316.50. Start with artery-hardening rillettes with the crunch of cornichon. Follow that with coarse ground, shouty sausages on a bed of lentils, or a Breton galette of eggs and chanterelles. Finish with crepes with salted butter caramel. As with the whole group they take their wines seriously, and there&apos;s always an intriguing choice by the\u00a0glass at great prices. 54 St Martin&apos;s Lane, London WC2N 4EA. 020-7836 2645; greenmanfrenchhorn.co ", "publicationDate": "2014-01-19T08:00:00Z", "tags": ["Restaurants", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jan/19/10-best-value-restaurants-britain", "title": "The 10 best value restaurants in Britain", "sentences": ["There&apos;s Kaosarn&apos;s super spicy Bangkok-style noodle soup at \u00a37.90, or a sizable portion of the addictive chilli chicken wings at The Joint, yours for \u00a33.50."]}, {"article": "Thailand&apos;s constitutional court has ruled that elections due early next month can be delayed because of the unrest that has shaken the country since protests began late last year.

The Election Commission had said the potential for violence and the absence of registered candidates in some areas meant the vote should be delayed, but the government had argued that was not legally possible. The court said in its ruling on Friday that the power to delay the polls rested with Yingluck and the head of the commission.

On Wednesday, hardline protesters tore down the signage in front of the country&apos;s national police headquarters near Bangkok&apos;s Siam Square, and ordinary middle-class demonstrators embellished the scene with graffiti. Vendors nearby sell T-shirts with anti-police slogans. Meanwhile, pro-government groups sport T-shirts declaring &quot;We love the police&quot;. The Peoples&apos; Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC), as the protest movement is known, claims to be calling for rule of law and a crackdown on corruption, among other demands. The PDRC instead supports the army, which has staged numerous coups d&apos;etat over the past 80 years. The police have been extremely reluctant to confront the demonstrators directly, instead conducting joint security operations with the army. Tensions between the police and the military are nothing new in Thailand, but since the 1950s the army has always been supreme. Until 2001, that is, when a former police officer became Thailand&apos;s prime minister. Known to this day as police lieutenant-colonel Thaksin Shinawatra, the billionaire telecommunications tycoon restored some of his old agency&apos;s lost prestige. But by the time Thaksin was ousted by a military coup in September 2006, the clash between two competing power networks was evident. On one side was the military, the elite bureaucracy, the palace and most of Thailand&apos;s blue-chip companies, backed by the Bangkok middle classes and voters from selected regions, notably the south. On the other side were the police, a set of newer and more aggressive business interests, and huge numbers of voters from the populous north and north-east. Thaksin had successfully tapped into the aspirations of the nation&apos;s underdogs: the millions of urbanised villagers, registered to vote in the provinces, who spent most of their working lives in and around Thailand&apos;s big cities. The political establishment has tried everything to purge Thaksinisation from Thai politics, but to no avail. The country has been convulsed by huge street protests five times since 2006 \u2013 most notoriously the 2008 anti-Thaksin yellowshirt demonstrations, which culminated in the closure of Bangkok&apos;s airports, and the 2010 pro-Thaksin redshirt protests that were violently suppressed by the army \u2013 with no resolution in sight. Today, Thaksin is living in self-imposed exile to avoid a two-year jail sentence for corruption-related offences handed down in 2008. His conciliatory sister Yingluck Shinawatra became prime minister in 2011 after pro-Thaksin parties won their fifth successive election victory. But Yingluck&apos;s compromising administration lost the upper hand after an ill-conceived plan to issue an amnesty to everyone accused of politically related offences since the coup \u2013 including her brother \u2013 backfired badly in November. Yingluck&apos;s inner circle has responded sluggishly to the rapidly evolving crisis that followed, failing to think strategically or to give policy options systematic consideration. Key decisions to dissolve parliament and to invoke emergency legislation were made too late to defuse tensions. The latest PDRC protests centre on the shutdown of government buildings and key Bangkok intersections. They are led by Suthep Thueksuban, a former deputy prime minister from the opposition Democrat party, who has abandoned parliament to orchestrate civil disobedience that borders on mob rule. His movement is strong on vitriolic personal attacks at government figures, but weak on credible proposals to address Thailand&apos;s complex political problems. At the heart of this conflict are fissures in the Thai state, and the politicisation of the security forces. Ironically, after facing the heat largely alone during the early weeks of the protests, the police now feel a sense of relief that the onus for managing the conflict is shifting to the army. A snap election has been called for 2 February, but may yet be postponed. The opposition is boycotting the election, which will do little to address Thailand&apos;s deep political polarisation. A compromise is urgently needed, one that would bring all the country&apos;s warring factions and rival agencies together to avert further violence. Like it or not, such a compromise will need initiative from men in uniform \u2013 and not in the form of another destructive military power grab.", "publicationDate": "2014-01-24T13:30:01Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/24/divided-self-destructive-thailand-street-protests", "title": "Divided and self-destructive, Thailand is a long way from compromise | Duncan McCargo", "sentences": ["On Wednesday, hardline protesters tore down the signage in front of the country&apos;s national police headquarters near Bangkok&apos;s Siam Square, and ordinary middle-class demonstrators embellished the scene with graffiti.", "On one side was the military, the elite bureaucracy, the palace and most of Thailand&apos;s blue-chip companies, backed by the Bangkok middle classes and voters from selected regions, notably the south.", "The country has been convulsed by huge street protests five times since 2006 \u2013 most notoriously the 2008 anti-Thaksin yellowshirt demonstrations, which culminated in the closure of Bangkok&apos;s airports, and the 2010 pro-Thaksin redshirt protests that were violently suppressed by the army \u2013 with no resolution in sight.", "The latest PDRC protests centre on the shutdown of government buildings and key Bangkok intersections."]}, {"article": "As Thailand&apos;s protests intensify and a state of emergency is imposed in and around Bangkok, some have begun referring to the demonstrations as &quot;antidemocratic&quot;, zeroing in on the opposition&apos;s boycott of a forthcoming election and the protest leaders&apos; calls for an unelected &quot;people&apos;s council&quot; to replace existing democratic structures. But the truth is more complex, with the protesters being arguably \u2013 and paradoxically \u2013 more democratically minded than the elected government they oppose. To understand how this is possible, one has to scratch beneath the surface of Thai politics and dispel some myths. Myth 1: The protesters are mainly &apos;Bangkok elites&apos; The government is led by Yingluck Shinawatra, who is widely acknowledged to be the proxy of her self-exiled brother and former PM Thaksin Shinawatra. The protests began last November after the parliament passed an amnesty bill that wiped Thaskin&apos;s slate clean, allowing him to return to Thailand without serving his two-year jail sentence. Spearheaded by the opposition Democrat party and Bangkok&apos;s middle classes, the protests grew even after the bill was withdrawn, morphing into a wider movement to reform Thailand&apos;s politics, cleansing them of Thaksin&apos;s influence once and for all. These protesters are often called an &quot;elite&quot; by pro-Thaksin groups \u2013 it&apos;s a term used to discredit their opponents, and it has caught on among many in the international media. In reality, while the protests indeed have their centre in Bangkok, most protesters are fairly diverse, and include the city&apos;s middle and working classes, as well as students and people of all walks of life from Thailand&apos;s south. Crucially, the majority of the Bangkok-born working class do not support the government. It is true that the protest does not enjoy much support in the country&apos;s northern and northeastern regions, where the majority of Thailand&apos;s population resides. This geographic divide highlights the protest&apos;s limits as a national movement, but it in no way supports the notion that protesters are an unrepresentative elite. Myth 2: Urban protesters oppose rural Thais&apos; desire for equality The protests were never driven by a need of urban Thais to deprive their rural compatriots of their rights, but were triggered by specific and highly provocative actions by the pro-Thaksin government and parliament. The controversial amnesty bill carried one clear message: we are here to serve, first and foremost, the needs of Thaksin Shinawatra, not the country \u2013 and it was, in effect, the last straw. But while the protesters want to remove Thaksin from Thailand&apos;s body politic, they do not specifically seek to punish his rural supporters. When Yingluck Shinawatra first assumed power after winning the 2011 election, all Thais accepted the result peacefully. Had &quot;Bangkok elites&quot; wanted to bring down the government simply because it represented the power of their opponents, they would&apos;ve come out against it much sooner. Some protesters have, unfortunately, said disparaging things about rural Thais, questioning their ability to make the &quot;right&quot; electoral choices due to a lack of education and other perceived faults. What this shows is that Thailand has a long way to go in conquering the many stereotypes that exist among its people \u2013 but it does not point to a protest born of a desire of one part of the population to disenfranchise another. Myth 3: The protesters want &apos;less democracy&apos; Thai protesters will invariably tell you that democracy does not end with elections \u2013 that it is not simply a piece of paper placed into a ballot box. This shows parallels to Egypt last year, as masses piled into the streets, challenging the elected government of Mohamed Morsi in its drive to consolidate power and impose a theocratic state on an unwilling populace. It&apos;s not that Egyptians did not want democracy \u2013 a year earlier they had died in the streets fighting for it \u2013 but they felt democracy was usurped by the very government elected under its rules. Thai protesters&apos; anger and disillusionment comes from a similar place. They are reacting to the government&apos;s abuses of power, its vast corruption and a majoritarian style of rule that excluded opponents from any decision-making on key issues of governance. As the government became more and more dedicated to fulfilling Thaksin&apos;s need to regain power, it became not just distasteful to the protesters, but politically illegitimate. To the protesters, Thaksin has always been seen as an autocrat for whom democracy is simply a means to holding on to power, not a guiding political philosophy. Therefore opposing Thaksin and his proxy government is not seen as antidemocratic \u2013 as Thaksin himself is antidemocratic in substance, if democratic in form. Meanwhile, Yingluck&apos;s dissolution of parliament and call for new elections as the protests intensified was viewed as nothing but a raised middle finger to the protesters: &quot;We don&apos;t care what you&apos;re protesting or demanding; we will have an election, and we will win on the strength of our supporters alone. You don&apos;t matter!&quot; The protesters heard this message loud and clear, and it only deepened their resolve to resist an illegitimate government, hiding behind the facade of an election. Hence, the demand for &quot;reform before election&quot; \u2013 with most protesters accepting democracy with free elections as a basic form of government, but only after reforming the system to eliminate Thaksin&apos;s influence from Thai politics. In truth, eliminating Thaksin and his influence from Thai politics may be a very tall order, and the protest leaders&apos; unyielding demands for a vague and unelected council will have to be tempered by a more realistic and nationally acceptable compromise. Nevertheless, the protests in Thailand are not fundamentally antidemocratic. It is a reform movement born of a deep frustration and outrage with the way democracy has been cheapened and abused by one man and his interminable drive to regain power.", "publicationDate": "2014-01-25T04:00:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Protest", "Thaksin Shinawatra"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/25/thailand-protesters-less-democracy-myth", "title": "No, Thailand's protesters don't want 'less democracy' | Dave Sherman", "sentences": ["As Thailand&apos;s protests intensify and a state of emergency is imposed in and around Bangkok, some have begun referring to the demonstrations as &quot;antidemocratic&quot;, zeroing in on the opposition&apos;s boycott of a forthcoming election and the protest leaders&apos; calls for an unelected &quot;people&apos;s council&quot; to replace existing democratic structures.", "Myth 1: The protesters are mainly &apos;Bangkok elites&apos; The government is led by Yingluck Shinawatra, who is widely acknowledged to be the proxy of her self-exiled brother and former PM Thaksin Shinawatra.", "Spearheaded by the opposition Democrat party and Bangkok&apos;s middle classes, the protests grew even after the bill was withdrawn, morphing into a wider movement to reform Thailand&apos;s politics, cleansing them of Thaksin&apos;s influence once and for all.", "In reality, while the protests indeed have their centre in Bangkok, most protesters are fairly diverse, and include the city&apos;s middle and working classes, as well as students and people of all walks of life from Thailand&apos;s south.", "Crucially, the majority of the Bangkok-born working class do not support the government.", "Had &quot;Bangkok elites&quot; wanted to bring down the government simply because it represented the power of their opponents, they would&apos;ve come out against it much sooner."]}, {"article": "Proposals to postpone Thailand&apos;s controversial general election for at least one month threaten to transform the current confrontation between government and opposition into a permanent state of crisis with potentially damaging region-wide ramifications. Monday&apos;s recommendation by Thailand&apos;s election commission to delay the poll, due on 2 February, follows intensified violence at the weekend. One person was killed and 12 were injured when anti-government protesters blockaded advance polling stations, bringing the total death toll to 10 since the unrest began in November. Further complicating an already dangerously confused situation, the prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, and her Pheu Thai party are insisting the election must go ahead on time. They fear an escalation of violence, causing further collateral damage to the economy, foreign investment and tourism, plus the ever present possibility of military intervention. &quot;We have to press ahead \u2026 a postponement would be futile and would only give independent organisations more time to target the government,&quot; said the interior minister, Jarupong Ruangsuwan. But even if she gets her way, Yingluck&apos;s dilemma is plain. The main opposition Democrat party and the protest leader, Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy prime minister, have pledged to boycott the poll, ensuring that the inevitable Pheu Thai victory will be rendered virtually meaningless. A bigger casualty could be democracy itself, a delicate flower in coup-prone Thailand as it is in other countries in south-east Asia. Suggesting in effect that the democratic system has failed, the opposition wants an unelected &quot;people&apos;s council&quot; to oversee a national reform programme. They claim this is required to end the corruption and abuse of power represented by Yingluck and her exiled brother, the Pheu Thai founder and former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra. Recent unrest in three Asian countries \u2013 Bangladesh, Cambodia and Thailand \u2013 had several factors in common, the New York Times commented this month. &quot;While the immediate causes for the turmoil are different in each country, they share several shortcomings. The lack of sufficient democratic checks and balances in all three has undermined faith in elections and helped to create the conditions for civil unrest. Autocratic and corrupt political leaders have used government agencies, in some cases over decades, to serve themselves and their cronies.&quot; Thailand&apos;s looming royal succession may only add to the instability. The ailing King Bhumibol has been on the throne since 1946, making him the world&apos;s longest-reigning monarch, and is revered by most Thais. The crown prince, Vajiralongkorn, is much less popular and lacks the authority of his father. A discredited monarchy under new management may only accelerate Thailand&apos;s slow-burn disintegration as a functioning, unified state. Like its neighbours, Thailand has benefited in recent decades from rapid development but remains economically vulnerable to prolonged political unrest, said the commentator William Pesek. &quot;The circus-like dysfunction in Bangkok is unique. The weaknesses being exposed there are not. From Thailand to Indonesia to Malaysia \u2013 even as far as India \u2013 Asian nations are displaying an extremely worrying set of shared vulnerabilities. &quot;Across the region, debt-fuelled growth is wrecking household balance sheets. Large subsidies are draining government coffers. Asset bubbles in real estate and equities continue to swell. The gap between rich and poor is widening \u2026 this combination of factors could be pushing the region toward another crash, perhaps in the very near future.&quot; The crisis in Thailand has wider negative implications for the US, the country&apos;s principal ally, but Washington has little choice but to watch from the sidelines, said the analyst Robert Kaplan. &quot;Thailand&apos;s internal dissensions mask a regional risk. America&apos;s oldest Asian ally faces political stalemate at the very moment Washington seeks to shore up its influence in the face of China&apos;s rise. The US wants to see a stable south-east Asia not only for economic growth, but also to create a unified bloc in the long run that can hinder China. &quot;Thailand&apos;s clash between traditionalism and new money may echo throughout the region. To the west, Burma has only recently begun an &apos;opening up&apos; process \u2026 to the south, Malaysia&apos;s one-party state is combating a threatening opposition movement by reviving ethnic Malay nationalism. To the east, Cambodia faces a growing trend of opposition unrest, and the Vietnamese Communist party is wrestling with the Chinese conundrum of how to harness capitalism without losing power. &quot;Thailand proves that south-east Asia is a region to watch. Decades of prosperity have created the conditions for political transformation \u2013 for better and for worse.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-01-27T13:35:31Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/27/thai-election-postponement-tip-permanent-crisis", "title": "Thai election postponement could tip country into permanent crisis", "sentences": ["&quot;The circus-like dysfunction in Bangkok is unique."]}, {"article": "Over 100,000 police and 10,000 soldiers will be deployed across Thailand on Sunday to protect voters and polling stations in a snap election that observers warn could lead to violence \u2013 with anti-government demonstrators threatening to block voting booths and pro-government redshirts vowing to &quot;monitor&quot; the polls. So far 10 people have been killed and over 500 injured by grenade attacks and shootings since protests began in November calling for the ousting of the prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, in what rights groups say signals a &quot;spiralling&quot; toward violence. Three months of protests have seen demonstrators lay siege to government ministries, shut off power and water to officials&apos; private homes, threaten to take the prime minister hostage and &quot;shutdown&quot; parts of downtown Bangkok with rally stages and ad hoc campsites. Yingluck imposed a state of emergency last week and on Wednesday attempted to assuage voters&apos; fears to head to the polls to cast their votes. &quot;I ask everyone involved in the election, particularly security forces, to ensure that people can go out and vote,&quot; she told reporters. The labour minister Chalerm Yoobamrung, who oversees the emergency decree, warned that anyone attempting to obstruct the vote would be met with official resistance. &quot;Those who are thinking of going and shutting polling stations in the morning should think twice because the police will not allow them to,&quot; he said. Roughly 2 million people were unable to cast advance votes last Sunday after protesters blocked roads, locked up polling booths and, in some instances, attacked voters. With the opposition Democrat party boycotting Sunday&apos;s vote, anti-government demonstrators \u2013 under the umbrella People&apos;s Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC) \u2013 have vowed to stop voters once again from heading to the polls. &quot;Thailand is spiralling into political violence as opposition and pro-government groups respond tit for tat against attacks and provocations,&quot; warned Human Rights Watch&apos;s Asia director Brad Adams. &quot;Preventing people from casting ballots shows serious contempt for basic rights of voters and democratic principles.&quot; Given the peculiarity of the situation, Sunday&apos;s election \u2013 estimated to cost 3.8bn baht, or \u00a370m \u2013 could be rendered invalid, said election commissioner Somchai Srisuthiyakorn, as the constitution requires polls to be held nationwide within a single day, local media reported. Up to 10,000 polling booths across Thailand are expected to be closed on Sunday, so byelections would need to take place in coming months to establish a parliamentary quorum. Some 28 constituencies in the south, where the Democrat party has a stronghold, have no candidates for Sunday&apos;s election after protesters prevented registration from taking place last month. Protesters are calling for the immediate ousting of Yingluck \u2013 who they see as a proxy of her brother Thaksin, the former premier who was himself ousted in a military coup in 2006 and now lives in Dubai to avoid jail on corruption charges \u2013 and are calling for her government to be replaced with an unelected &quot;people&apos;s council&quot; instead. They point to a failed billion-dollar rice subsidy scheme, alleged corruption and an amnesty bill that would have allowed Thaksin to return without having to serve his corruption charge as reasons why they want &quot;reform before election&quot;. Yingluck&apos;s ruling Puea Thai party, or versions of it, have won every election for the past 10 years and are expected to win Sunday&apos;s poll too, putting the Democrat party in a losing position that critics claim is the reason they prefer to boycott Sunday&apos;s election. In a nation that has seen 18 coups or attempted coups since 1932, many observers believe that unrest on Sunday could once again prompt either the military or the judiciary to step in to prevent violence. Thai courts have in the past forced pro-Thaksin governments from power, and this week a criminal court rejected the government&apos;s proposed arrest warrant for PDRC leader and former deputy premier Suthep Thaugsuban \u2013 who is facing insurrection and murder charges for his role in the 2010 anti-government protests that saw 100 people killed and 2,000 injured \u2013 citing insufficient evidence. Suthep himself has also faced corruption charges, a confounding twist for a leader attempting to &quot;rid&quot; Thailand of the very same thing. &quot;It is so ironic that people like him [Suthep] can become leader of an anti-corruption group,&quot; agrees Somkiat Tangkitvanich of the thinktank Thailand Development Research Institute. &quot;But people have gathered to support the PDRC because they would like to express their dissatisfaction with the current government \u2013 so they&apos;re not for someone, but they&apos;re against someone.&quot; Late on Friday in Bangkok, high-profile supporters of the PDRC, including former yellowshirt leader Sondhi Limthongkul, took to rally stages to ask voters if there really was any value in a core staple of democracy. &quot;What good is your right [to vote] if they [this government] don&apos;t respect your rights anyway?&quot; Sondhi asked the crowd, prompting a loud show of whistle-blowing, clapping and cheering.", "publicationDate": "2014-01-31T15:58:23Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Protest"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/31/thailand-sunday-polls-spiralling-violence", "title": "Thailand prepares for polls amid warning of 'spiralling toward violence'", "sentences": ["Three months of protests have seen demonstrators lay siege to government ministries, shut off power and water to officials&apos; private homes, threaten to take the prime minister hostage and &quot;shutdown&quot; parts of downtown Bangkok with rally stages and ad hoc campsites.", "&quot;But people have gathered to support the PDRC because they would like to express their dissatisfaction with the current government \u2013 so they&apos;re not for someone, but they&apos;re against someone.&quot; Late on Friday in Bangkok, high-profile supporters of the PDRC, including former yellowshirt leader Sondhi Limthongkul, took to rally stages to ask voters if there really was any value in a core staple of democracy."]}, {"article": "Gunfire and explosions rocked Bangkok following clashes between pro-government &quot;red shirts&quot; and protesters, leading to fears of further violence as Thais head to the polls.

The clashes are the latest round of violence in three months of anti-government protests that have seen at least 10 people killed and more than 570 injured, with demonstrators calling for the ousting of the prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, whose government they claim is corrupt and should be replaced by an unelected &quot;people&apos;s council&quot;. Yingluck&apos;s Puea Thai party is largely expected to win the snap polls, a major blow to the main opposition Democrat party, which supports the anti-government protests and is boycotting the election. Protesters have vowed to stop voters from heading to the booths and obstructed a number of ballot boxes from being delivered both in Bangkok and 12 provinces in the south, the election commission said. Protesters last week prevented some 2 million people across Thailand from casting advance votes last Sunday by chaining shut polling stations, blockading roads, and, in some circumstances, forcibly removing voters from the polling areas. Although some 130,000 police and 10,000 soldiers have been deployed across Thailand for election, tension and unease have begun to permeate the capital, where most of the recent violence \u2013 from drive-by shootings to grenade attacks \u2013 has taken place. In Thailand&apos;s often colour-coded world of political rivalry, pro-government &quot;red shirts&quot; generally clash with anti-government &quot;yellow shirts&quot;. But protest leaders encouraged their followers to wear red in celebration of the Chinese new year, and some present at the clashes \u2013 including unidentified men firing guns \u2013 could be seen wearing green armbands, the same colour as those issued by the Thai Journalists Association, potentially putting members of the media in danger through association. Led by the former MP Suthep Thaugsuban, protesters have set up ad hoc camping sites at rally stages across the capital, taken over government ministries and even threatened to take Yingluck hostage in their bid to rid Thailand of the &quot;Thaksin regime&quot;, a reference to Yingluck&apos;s billionaire brother and former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and now lives in Dubai to avoid corruption charges that he claims were politically motivated. Saturday&apos;s The violence is yet another chapter in an ongoing, years-long battle between those who support Thaksin, a former telecoms tycoon who won voting support from northern and northeastern provinces for his populist policies such as universal healthcare and rice-subsidy schemes, and those who believe him to be nothing more than a corrupt businessman who sullied Thailand&apos;s politics. Critics point to Thaksin&apos;s populist agenda, including the rice-subsidy scheme that has cost Thailand roughly $1bn and left a number of farmers without payment, and an amnesty bill that would have allowed Thaksin to return to the country without being imprisoned, as proof of the &quot;dirty politics&quot; that his party engages in. Much of the continuing battle has been painted as a simple north versus south, rich versus poor, divide, in which the mainly urban Bangkok elite and southern states are competing for power against the mainly rural north and north-east voters who support Thaksin. But a growing dissatisfaction with the government&apos;s handling of various policies, including the rice-subsidy plan, has seen protesters include many groups, with demonstrations taking place even in red shirt strongholds in northern provinces, where farmers&apos; networks have blockaded roads and vowed to boycott the vote in order to voice their dissatisfaction with Yingluck&apos;s government. &quot;The government took our rice and never paid us,&quot; said Kittisak Rattanawaraha, who leads the Northern Farmers Network in Pichit, where pro-Thaksin forces have long set politics. &quot;We&apos;ve been airing our grievances for months, but the government hasn&apos;t paid serious attention to our plight \u2013 so we will not be voting on Sunday.&quot; Various other groups \u2013 including academics, businessmen and politicians \u2013 also claim their frustration with the government, claiming that they have been embarrassed by Thaksin&apos;s &quot;greed&quot; for money \u2013 and, by default, his sister&apos;s stance as a so-called puppet in her brother&apos;s party, whose slogan reads &quot;Thaksin thinks; Puea Thai does&quot;. &quot;I really hoped he could bring a new way of governing to Thailand, but he is a human buyer \u2013 he buys everyone,&quot; says Kaewsan Athibodhi, leader of the Thai Spring group and an outspoken Thaksin opponent who investigated the former prime minister for corruption as part of a committee. &quot;Our culture, our way of thinking right now in Thai culture, is not &apos;democracy&apos;. Our culture is patron and client, and authoritarian. We accept power and we need patrons, but we need to go under democracy. We have no choice. It is the best choice for us to live together, whether we have a clever or foolish leader.&quot; Critics of the protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy prime minister who came to power after Thaksin was ousted in the 2006 military coup and has faced corruption charges of his own, allege that those attempting to &quot;reform&quot; Thailand are just as dirty as Thaksin, and may be suffering from an inability to win popular support. The opposition Democrat party has not won an election in 20 years and protesters insist that reform must occur before elections take place, although how they intend to initiate those reforms is still unclear. In a nation that has seen 18 attempted or real coups since 1932, the threat of yet another one in the coming days or weeks \u2013 whether by the military or the judiciary, both of which have forced Thai governments from power in the past \u2013 seems ever present, with one study projecting a 10.9% likelihood of a coup occurring this year. So far Thaksin, the man the protesters love to hate, has remained silent on the violence currently racking his country. But his lawyer and spokesman, Noppadon Pattama, said that the former prime minister was &quot;worried about the future of Thailand&quot;. &quot;He is worried about the destruction of the democratic system in Thailand,&quot; Noppadon explained. &quot;People here do not play by the rules, that&apos;s the problem.&quot; As for the ill-conceived midnight amnesty bill that would have allowed Thaksin to be reunited with his billions and avoid imprisonment \u2013 which sparked the protests and has caused death and injury \u2013 Noppadon sits back and clasps his hands together. &quot;Looking back, it wasn&apos;t a good idea. It was an unfortunate move and it provided our opponents with lots of ammunition against us,&quot; he concedes, sighing. &quot;It was a miscalculation.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-02-01T17:58:41Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Protest", "Thaksin Shinawatra"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/01/bangkok-bombs-protests-grow-eve-poll", "title": "Bangkok rocked by gunfire and bombs as protests grow on eve of poll", "sentences": ["Gunfire and explosions rocked Bangkok following clashes between pro-government &quot;red shirts&quot; and protesters, leading to fears of further violence as Thais head to the polls.", "Protesters have vowed to stop voters from heading to the booths and obstructed a number of ballot boxes from being delivered both in Bangkok and 12 provinces in the south, the election commission said.", "Much of the continuing battle has been painted as a simple north versus south, rich versus poor, divide, in which the mainly urban Bangkok elite and southern states are competing for power against the mainly rural north and north-east voters who support Thaksin."]}, {"article": "Tens of thousands of Thais were unable to cast their ballots on Sunday after anti-government protesters blockaded roads and commandeered polling booths in what has become an increasingly tense political standoff. Although the prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, is highly likely to be re-elected \u2013 as her party, or versions of it, has won every election since 2001 \u2013 thousands of Thais have boycotted the vote in protest and thousands more have been prevented by protesters from casting their ballots. About 130,000 police officers were deployed in an effort to boost security during voting after pro- and anti-government demonstrators clashed in northern Bangkok on Saturday, when at least seven people were injured after a gun attack near a ballot-storage office. At least 10 people have been killed and almost 600 more injured since protests began in November. &quot;Today is an important day,&quot; said Yingluck as she cast her vote early on Sunday. &quot;I would like to invite Thai people to come out and vote to uphold democracy.&quot; Anti-government demonstrators vowed to continue their fight against the so-called &quot;Thaksin regime&quot; until Yingluck stepped down voluntarily or by force. Protesters claim Yingluck Shinawatra&apos;s government is controlled by her brother, Thaksin, who was ousted as prime minister in a military coup in 2006 and now lives in Dubai to avoid corruption charges he claims are politically motivated. They also argue that democracy means more than just casting a ballot and have called for reforms before elections. &quot;If we vote today we will lose our nation, because we will legitimise Yingluck&apos;s government,&quot; said Kruawan Noonchuen, 51, a rubber plantation owner from the southern province of Surat Thani. She had been camping along with several hundred others in a park near a protest rally. &quot;If Yingluck doesn&apos;t resign, I will stay here until she does. I will only vote if the Shinawatra government is no longer controlling the country,&quot; she said. Sunday&apos;s snap election was intended to bring some sense of calm to Thailand. Demonstrators want to see Yingluck replaced by an unelected &quot;people&apos;s council&quot;, which they claim would reform the nation&apos;s current &quot;dirty politics&quot; system. It is unclear how many of Thailand&apos;s 49 million eligible voters headed to the polls, which were boycotted by the opposition Democrat party. Supporters of the protest umbrella group People&apos;s Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC) did likewise or prevent pro-government voters from voting. About 6 million registered voters across Thailand were affected by the closed polling stations, according to the country&apos;s electoral commission. Almost 500 of Bangkok&apos;s 6,671 polling booths were closed and people in nine provinces in the south were also unable to cast their votes. Anti-government demonstrators blocked the delivery of ballot boxes, blockaded roads and stood &quot;guard&quot; at polling station in pro-government districts to prevent voting, although in the rest of the country, voting was largely peaceful and without problems. At Din Daeng polling station in north Bangkok, anti-government demonstrators set up barricades to prevent &quot;red shirts&quot; (government supporters) from casting their votes. Officials decided to close the polling booth after an altercation between the two sides and a gunshot was heard. A thin line of police stood guard at the office doors but were swept aside by voters who rushed through the building looking for the ballot boxes. &quot;This situation is ridiculous,&quot; shouted Lek Saksaphrapha, 52, as she complained to the handful of bewildered-looking police that she had the right to vote. &quot;Why didn&apos;t anyone figure out how to deal with this before the day of the election? The Election Commission should let us vote to see who will win and who will lose. The country cannot go on like this.&quot; Although roughly 89% of Thailand&apos;s polling booths saw no disruption, Sunday&apos;s vote will be unlikely to lead to any clear resolution to the political quagmire. Official results will not be ready until all districts have been able to vote, and some reruns have already been rescheduled for late February after last week&apos;s advanced voting in which roughly two million people were prevent from casting their ballot. Because anti-government demonstrators blocked candidate registration in 28 southern provinces, parliament will not have enough representatives to form a quorum what ever the final outcome of the poll. This means Yingluck \u2013 should she be reinstated \u2013 will only have provisional, caretaker capabilities until those areas able to hold a vote. It also makes it likely that the political instability will continue for months to come, because the constituencies needing to fill those seats support the Democrat party and current anti-government movement. &quot;The Democrats have been losing elections for the last 20 years \u2013 that&apos;s why they didn&apos;t want the election to happen,&quot; said Somkhit Aramphibunkit, 59, as she looked at her locked-up polling booth in north Bangkok. &quot;If they were to join in these polls, they would just lose again.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-02-02T15:41:02Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/02/thai-voters-prevented-casting-ballot-anti-government-protesters", "title": "Thai voters prevented from casting ballot by anti-government protesters", "sentences": ["About 130,000 police officers were deployed in an effort to boost security during voting after pro- and anti-government demonstrators clashed in northern Bangkok on Saturday, when at least seven people were injured after a gun attack near a ballot-storage office.", "Almost 500 of Bangkok&apos;s 6,671 polling booths were closed and people in nine provinces in the south were also unable to cast their votes.", "At Din Daeng polling station in north Bangkok, anti-government demonstrators set up barricades to prevent &quot;red shirts&quot; (government supporters) from casting their votes.", "&quot;The Democrats have been losing elections for the last 20 years \u2013 that&apos;s why they didn&apos;t want the election to happen,&quot; said Somkhit Aramphibunkit, 59, as she looked at her locked-up polling booth in north Bangkok."]}, {"article": "As a former fighter pilot, Bj\u00f8rn Kjos, 67, was long ago trained to spring surprise attacks. The tall, craggy Norwegian Air Shuttle boss swooped into Gatwick last year as an upstart rival to easyJet and Ryanair \u2013 now already he has his sights trained on other targets, with plans to start flights to New York this July for as little as \u00a3389 return. Flying low cost across the Atlantic overturns accepted industry wisdom \u2013 similar BA flights are currently priced upwards of \u00a3800 \u2013 but with Gatwick&apos;s owners desperate to break Heathrow&apos;s dominance of long-haul, Kjos, also at various times a lawyer and thriller writer, thinks he can make this seemingly unlikely plot work. The scale is tiny \u2013 so far. Having started linking Bangkok, Oslo and New York last year, the airline will only be running three Gatwick-USA flights a week until its fleet of three 787 Dreamliners doubles. Norwegian Air Shuttle itself has grown from similarly small beginnings \u2013 Kjos claims to have become the boss by default: having left the air force he was working as a lawyer for friends at what was a small domestic airline, until he found himself the major shareholder when not enough other employees fancied investing in the business. Twenty years on, Norwegian has a short-haul fleet of 80 planes \u2013 and that new Gatwick base. Michael O&apos;Leary, Ryanair&apos;s boss, dismisses the new operation as insignificant. But others have pinned significant hopes to Norwegian&apos;s success: Gatwick boss Stewart Wingate, pushing the claims of his airport for a second runway against Heathrow, described Norwegian&apos;s long-haul launch as a &quot;game-changing event&quot;. But how would low-cost long haul work? Kjos said the bets have been changed by three things: more fuel-efficient planes, the internet and a shift in global economic power. The Boeing 787 gives a greater range and guzzles less fuel than previous comparable models; Kjos also financed the purchase of his planes at favourable rates due to export guarantees not available to rivals based in the US or EU countries where the aircraft are manufactured. The internet, he said, does away with marketing costs and circumvents the problems that made past ventures such as Freddie Laker&apos;s fail. &quot;He might have had a chance if the digital world had existed, but he had to rely on the travel agents, which strangled him. Now you Google and you find the cheap\u00a0tickets.&quot; Flying a short-haul low-cost operation is a prerequisite, he said. The lessons to be implemented in long-haul include intense aircraft utilisation: the schedule and routes, with hops to LA and Florida, mean his 787s will be in the air for 18 hours a day rather than the average of 12, with swift turnarounds wherever they land. He is relocating his bases to places with large catchment areas, Bangkok and American cities rather than Oslo \u2013 and hiring local crews at a fraction of Norwegian salaries. Kjos insists the reasons are more strategic and operational than purely the wage bill \u2013 while he admits that there are &quot;lower social costs&quot; in Bangkok, he said they pay the same, low salaries to American and Thai\u00a0crew. Kjos has more than a touch of the O&apos;Leary when discussing controversies around his airline, which has jettisoned Scandinavian terms of employment, set up bases abroad and now officially operates under an Irish licence, partly to benefit from open skies agreements with the US. In Norway, there have been complaints that it is no longer really a Norwegian airline. &quot;We don&apos;t give a shit about that. We go where the passengers go. Norway is just too small to survive.&quot; The future, he said, will see not just millions of Europeans, let alone Norwegians, seeking out a holiday bargain, but Chinese, Indian and other customers with disposable income. &quot;It&apos;s obviously the leisure market that will travel. Do they go for price or comfort? They go for price.&quot; London, he reckons, will prove the biggest draw. &quot;It&apos;s the capital of Europe. We anticipate it will get most of the incoming traffic from the far east. A few people will go astray and end up in\u00a0Norway.&quot; He claims politicians have yet to wake up to the opportunities that cheap air travel can bring: he thinks the numbers of incoming tourists add up to millions of jobs to be created in Europe. That far outweighs any race to the bottom in a few thousand airline employees&apos; jobs, he said. &quot;If I was a politician, I wouldn&apos;t give a shit about the airline side.&quot; In Europe, he said: &quot;We&apos;ve exported all our industry to the far east. At least we have a very good museum to show them, they will have to come spend money in our museum.&quot; Yet whether Kjos&apos;s double-edged vision of Europe&apos;s prospects holds true or not, some are sceptical whether a truly low-cost, long-haul offering can flourish. Air transport consultant John Strickland said: &quot;It&apos;s being over-egged. There have been several failures so far. I&apos;d say Norwegian has a better chance than most \u2013 it has learned the ropes of low-cost efficiencies. But it has got to go through all sort of hoops to make it work\u00a0now.&quot; The economics are daunting, he said. &quot;Other airlines have got 787s as well, Kjos is not going to have a unique cost advantage.&quot; The kind of money airlines have made through ancillary revenues on short-haul, he said, cannot necessarily be replicated on long-haul: passengers can rarely avoid either eating or taking baggage on intercontinental flights and so the cost-conscious will be aware that the headline fare savings won&apos;t stack up. Fast turnaround and high utilisation of planes is a strategy fraught with risk. &quot;If you constantly schedule minimum turnarounds you risk delays. And if you don&apos;t fulfil your schedule, there&apos;s a loss of reputation and credibility in the industry and with disgruntled\u00a0passengers.&quot; In Scandinavia, Norwegian&apos;s nascent long-haul service has been deluged with complaints. Almost half of its summer departures were delayed, while hundreds of passengers were left stranded over Christmas in New York after problems with the Dreamliner. Goodwill is in short supply for Norwegian in parts of the US, and pilots have threatened to strike. As one observer said, Kjos has found nifty, entrepreneurial ways to cut costs, but they may come back to bite him: on a small fleet, there is little slack when things go wrong. At Gatwick in the summer, with no alternative airline on hand to rebook US-bound passengers, could have unpleasant repercussions for the airline and the airport&apos;s credibility. Others have tried and failed to make the business work. Zoom Airlines, a Canadian operation linking Gatwick and North America, had a brief existence in the last decade. Air Asia X, the long-haul branch of Malaysia&apos;s successful budget airline, also couldn&apos;t make the sums work from London. Three years after launching direct flights from Kuala Lumpur to Stansted, later switching to Gatwick, the service was pulled in spring 2012. Air Asia&apos;s chief executive Tony Fernandes said that service could restart &quot;as soon as Airbus gives us a plane that makes sense&quot; economically. He is awaiting delivery of a revamped A330 whose passenger volumes, capital costs and fuel consumption can serve Europe \u2013 but on a limited basis, namely London. &quot;It&apos;s the only long-haul route, along with Paris, that we would consider. Everyone wants to go to London,&quot; he said. But even with his airline&apos;s growing reach, carrying an estimated 46m passengers in 2013 to routes including Sydney, eight hours away, he doubts whether there is demand for much more than a couple of prime destinations. Fernandes said: &quot;Ultra long haul is a struggle. Marginal revenues drop off rapidly after five or six hours. The O&apos;Learys of this world have looked at it and shied away from it.&quot; O&apos;Leary, the Ryanair boss, has said he could only make it work with the right plane and enough of them \u2013 and the kind of bargain O&apos;Leary might hope to drive for a fuel-efficient long-range fleet cannot happen in the foreseeable future with Boeing and Airbus&apos;s books backlogged with megabucks orders from the Middle East. Yet the notion is now compelling enough for the man tasked with deciding where Britain&apos;s next airport is built to reference Norwegian in parliament. Sir Howard Davies, the chair of the airports commission, told the Commons transport committee: &quot;Are we going to see low-cost long haul? If that were to happen that would alter the balance between what we have traditionally thought of as hub capacity and point to point.&quot; The choice laid out so far for airport expansion in the UK \u2013 the Heathrow hub or Gatwick alternative \u2013 to a large part rests on those kind of competing visions of the future. &quot;You can produce a very plausible argument that air traffic will develop low-cost long haul,&quot; Davies\u00a0said. Strickland is to be convinced. &quot;Is this something that we can really hang our hat on in terms of airport strategy? Low-cost short-haul flights are the classic Norman Tebbit bikes for people migrating for work \u2013 Moroccans going to France, Poles to Britain \u2013 but long haul is a different story.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-02-04T16:11:33Z", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Norway", "Europe", "Business"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/04/norwegian-air-shuttle-low-cost-gatwick-bjorn-kos", "title": "How are Norwegian Air Shuttle's low-cost US flights financially possible?", "sentences": ["Having started linking Bangkok, Oslo and New York last year, the airline will only be running three Gatwick-USA flights a week until its fleet of three 787 Dreamliners doubles.", "He is relocating his bases to places with large catchment areas, Bangkok and American cities rather than Oslo \u2013 and hiring local crews at a fraction of Norwegian salaries.", "Kjos insists the reasons are more strategic and operational than purely the wage bill \u2013 while he admits that there are &quot;lower social costs&quot; in Bangkok, he said they pay the same, low salaries to American and Thai\u00a0crew."]}, {"article": "A photograph accompanying a report from Thailand, &quot;Bangkok rocked by gunfire and bombs&quot; (News, last week, page 22), was wrongly captioned &quot;A gunman wearing a green armband, the same colour as used by Thai journalists, shoots at anti-government demonstrators in Bangkok&quot;.

This nation was one of the first in Asia to grant women the right to vote but it is highly patriarchal and politics is still a man&apos;s world, says Bangkok&apos;s senator Rosana Tositrakul, 56, a self-styled &quot;Buddhist feminist&quot; who has had to fight her own battles in parliament too. &quot;Male MPs from the ruling party said in parliament that they wanted to kick me,&quot; she explains. &quot;The then house speaker helped protect them\u2026 and they ended up walking free from any punishment. &quot;I object to this sort of treatment of women no matter who they are, be they prime minister, MP or a woman on the street,&quot; Rosana says. But female MPs, who comprise just 16% of parliament, aren&apos;t always on the same side. Last year, some stood largely silent as their male colleagues called for the rape of their female opponents; other female MPs have publicly fought over who is more attractive. &quot;It is sad that female politicians in Thailand tend to consider the importance of beauty over capability or intellect,&quot; says Tositrakul. &quot;It is also sad but true that even PM Yingluck, a woman herself, has never protected female MPs as a whole\u2013 only the female MPs and senators who support her, and she ignores those from the opposition. Women in politics in Thailand face the problem of cronyism among themselves. Many of them don&apos;t pay attention to women&apos;s rights in general, but to the rights only of the female politicians in their group.&quot; This may be because the women who do make it into politics generally come from established dynasties, so they draw their support from their family base. &quot;Women who don&apos;t come from the families of influential politicians find it very hard to join politics,&quot; explains Rosana, who entered politics in 2008 as an independent after 30 years as a social activist, during which time she called for investigations into corruption of the health ministry. Her can-do attitude, she says, has given her a broad base of support. &quot;When I walk down the street, people come up to me to have their picture taken.&quot; She is calling for an amendment to the constitution to require that female MPs comprise at least 30% of parliament and hopes that Yingluck&apos;s 2011 election to the premiership will encourage more women to join politics. &quot;Thai politics is really a question of polarisation rather than gender,&quot; she says. &quot;PM Yingluck is highly respected by people in her party, as well as her supporters.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-02-09T07:04:00Z", "tags": ["Women in politics", "Thailand", "Politics", "Feminism", "Women", "Gender", "Life and style", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/feb/09/rosana-tositrakul-cronyism-women-thai-politics", "title": "Rosana Tositrakul: 'There's cronyism among women in Thai politics'", "sentences": ["This nation was one of the first in Asia to grant women the right to vote but it is highly patriarchal and politics is still a man&apos;s world, says Bangkok&apos;s senator Rosana Tositrakul, 56, a self-styled &quot;Buddhist feminist&quot; who has had to fight her own battles in parliament too."]}, {"article": "Each year around 1,000 Australians are arrested abroad, and  in 2013 there were 313 citizens serving time overseas, according to the Australian government.

They\u2019ve been hailed as the future of journalism, with industry insiders predicting they\u2019ll be in common use by the end of the year. So far, they\u2019ve captured the scale of the floods, protests in Kiev and Bangkok, and even been used in pre-budget news reports, but don\u2019t expect them to replace the Sky Copter just yet. Drones, helicams, hexacopters, octocopters or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as they are sometimes known, are small remotely-controlled devices with a camera attached. Having been in use by hobbyists and photographers alike to capture stunning aerial images for several years now, major media outlets have started to put serious efforts into exploring their use for reporting and verifying news. Robert Picard, co-author of a report on the use of drones for news gathering, has predicted they\u2019ll be in frequent use by the end of 2014.\u201cThings are moving,\u201d he says, \u201cand I suspect photo departments and broadcast news production will be using them more often this year. Most of the big broadcasters are already test using them and some print photographers are learning how to use smaller systems.\u201d         BBC drone footage showing the scale of the protests in Thailand.    The BBC hexacopter made its news debut in October 2013, and was developed and tested by Thomas Hannen, senior innovations producer in its global video unit.  \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting new way to tell stories, taking us from a human level to a birdseye overview.\u201d So far, the BBC has used drones to capture the HS2 route, unique aerial shots from Stonehenge, and fora \u201cSoccer Cities\u201d project underway in Brazil. \u201cAlthough it may not revolutionise news, it is certainly another tool in the journalist toolkit, particularly useful for stories for transport or with environmental and geographical elements to them. But, we don\u2019t see them as a replacement for a news helicopter.\u201d          Preview of Soccer Cities, currently being shot using drone technology in Brazil.    Sky News has a dedicated team of three looking into the opportunities for news reporting offered by technological advances such as drones and Google Glass. They are currently in the process of training their own in-house drone pilot.  Steve Bennedick, Sky News head of news technology, says that while the project is in an \u201cembryonic form\u201d, they are enthuasistic about the technology. \u201cObviously safety is paramount, we\u2019re going along very carefully. But it\u2019s a new way to get that wow shot, and why not offer an extra dimension to your news coverage?\u201dRussia Today, which have been exploring drone use for several years, has recently covered protests in Turkey and Ukraine to test the technology. \u201cSince the 2013 launch of RT\u2019s video news agency (Ruptly), we have been widely testing drone technology and plan to use it in the nearest future in a number of territories where the use of drones for civil purposes does not violate legal restrictions,\u201d a spokesman told MediaGuardian.  \u201cThe kind of content that drones can deliver is generally well-received by [the] RT audience. But while this technology has several clear advantages, particularly those of access, it is not without its challenges. There are legal limits to drone journalism in many countries, including the United States and Russia.\u201d          Footage of Kiev protests captured by Russia Today\u2019s drone.    Despite the obvious potential benefits of drone journalism \u2013 as a low-cost method to obtain stunning images, a way of covering conflict zones with reduced risk to reporters, among others \u2013 it does have dangers and drawbacks. Last month in Cape Town, South Africa, a man was reportedly nearly knocked off the roof of the Civic Centre by a drone attempting to capture footage and the news crew responsible later arrested. Legal restrictions are in place in many countries, including the UK, to stop this type of incident, but some laws go further. In the US, drone journalism is considered a commerical activity, and as such is currently banned under Federal Aviation Authority rules.  In the UK, journalists are less restricted, although flying a drone with a mounted camera does require a licence from the Civil Aviation Authority. In obtaining that licence, a news outlet is promising to adhere to certain guidelines \u2013 not to fly it out of direct line of sight of the operator, not to go within 50 metres of a building or property without permission, and certainly not to fly over crowds of people.  Asked if drones were the mode of the future for journalism, Dean Wynton, a pilot for Aerosightand an aerial photography specialist who has worked with the BBC and other broadcasters, and the man behind the Domino\u2019s \u201cDomnicopter\u201d advert which went viral last year, said \u201cit will never happen\u201d. With 17 years\u2019 experience of building and flying drones, he explains, \u201cthe technology simply isn\u2019t ready to tackle live broadcasts, 10 minutes at a time is the most you\u2019ll get out of a drone, and until battery technology improves, it certainly won\u2019t be ready for a good few years yet.\u201d As for flying over crowds of people, \u201cit can still kill someone,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a machine, which can fail like any other.You need landowner\u2019s permission to take off and land, you can\u2019t fly within 50 metres of property. It usually takes 21 days at least to get all of the permissions you need.\u201d         Domicopter advert which went viral in the US much to the creator\u2019s amusement.    However, the rules are bound to change as the use of drones becomes more commonplace. Former GCHQ boss, Sir David Omand, is now head of the commission on drones. Security grounds aside, he says the commission is likely to hear evidence on the use of drones for journalistic purposes.  Since the committee launched last September, Omand has pinpointed a specific group that causes concern:\u201cThe equipment \u2013 say, an ultralight type drone with a small HD camera that can beam pictures back to a laptop \u2013 are all available at prices the paparazzi can afford. So its only a matter of time before we see its use. Just think of President Hollande\u2019s exposure. \u201cThere is law relating to harrassment and there could be claims that human rights privacy have been breached.

It\u2019s hard to take a taxi in Bangkok after a Thailand game and not be told that the team needs a modern version of legendary 80s striker Piyapong Pue-on. Part of the deal of being a Malaysian fan is to mention \u2018Super\u2019 Mokhtar Dahari, the tree-trunk thighed terroriser of 70s and 80s defences and there are the Barcelona antics of the Filipino goal machine Paolo Alcantara that have caused many a misty-eyed Manila night. The present is not quite as glorious. One-by-one, after falling behind those in west and east Asia, the region\u2019s teams have fallen by the wayside en route to the 2015 Asian Cup in Australia next January. Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam have played a combined total of 15 qualifiers and managed one point between them. Then Singapore were put out of their misery in the early days of the Chinese Year of the Horse, leaving just Malaysia with a chance of representing south-east Asia next January \u2013 and even that is far from certain. Failure would leave a region of 600 million without representation again while roughly 150 million in west Asia have eight and counting \u2013 talk about underachievement. The sad truth is that match-fixing is the most likely topic in the international media when you read about football connected to Malaysia or Singapore. If it\u2019s Indonesia then it is going to be about political chaos or players dying after not getting paid and being unable to afford medical treatment and if it\u2019s Myanmar then perhaps it\u2019s crowd trouble and if it\u2019s another country, well, you are probably not reading about the other countries at all unless it is about another pre-season tour by an English Premier League giant. In most of the region, you can watch pretty much every English top-tier clash live every weekend. Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal (even after Saturday) shirts are common sights and exhibition games are as popular as they are expensive. In Singapore, football-lovers gather round in cafes and restaurants while ignoring the local S-League. In truth, the Premier League can be an easy target and blaming it for ASEAN ills is an oversimplification but it does cast a long shadow that makes it that little bit tougher for the local game to find a place in the sun. Corruption is a much bigger threat. Stories of match-fixing still abound in Malaysia creating a climate of suspicion. When a T-Team goalkeeper let in a corner last season, he was immediately hauled off, then literally pushed off, the pitch by English coach Peter Butler. But incompetence and politics are just as damaging. Powerful people are attracted to the beautiful game in the region and often local media either can\u2019t or won\u2019t call them to account. What has happened in Indonesia will become a case study for how not to run a country\u2019s football scene. It remains the only ASEAN participant in a World Cup (back in 1938 under the guise of Dutch East Indies) but now has the distinction of being the country with the highest potential but the lowest standard of governance. Fifa allowing a convicted criminal to run the national FA from his prison cell and return to his office upon release was breathtaking as were the eventual results that included the setting up of rebel leagues and federations, fan deaths, player deaths, player strikes and a whole lot more. Being caught in December in the Fifa rankings by Guam, an island with less than one thousandth of Indonesia\u2019s population, was another low.  At the national team level, repeated failure reinforces a negative tendency for south-east Asia to retreat into itself. It has become something of a football bubble with the national teams playing each other far too often outside the AFF Suzuki Cup. This biennial ASEAN tournament is far more colourful than equivalents in east, south or west Asia but few elsewhere care. The region does not yet export players to Europe to any significant extent and those who go overseas often leave amid fanfares before returning home quickly and quietly. There are occasionally wildly ambitious plans with major clubs in the big leagues such as the Thai trio who went to Manchester City in 2007 thanks to former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Exports to Australia and Melbourne victory were more successful but have not been built upon. Japan\u2019s J-League is eager to build links with the region and Indonesian star Irfan Bachdim has just signed for top tier club Ventforet Kofu in a move that needs to be a success, even just a moderate one.  Most of what progress has been made has come at club level where money can have a swift impact and while it is sporadic, some leagues are starting to be taken seriously. When Melbourne Victory take on Muangthong United in the final play-off of the Asian Champions League, they will be meeting a well-run, well-financed and well-supported outfit. The club from just north of Bangkok are setting standards in the Thai Premier League along with Buriram United. Buriram, owned by well-known politician and former Thakshin ally, Newin Chidchob, reached the last eight of the Asian Champions League last season, disposing of Brisbane Roar in the playoffs before finishing above Japan\u2019s Vegalta Sendai and China\u2019s Jiangsu Sainty. Then Uzbek powerhouse Bunyodkor was seen off in the second round. It was no fluke. The Malaysian league is also on the move, match-fixing controversies notwithstanding. While the likes of Vincent Tan and Tony Fernandes are investing money in the UK, there are others spending big in the former British colony. Pablo Aimar is with newly rich Johor DT and the Argentinian scored a beauty at the weekend even if his star-studded team lost 3-2 to a Pahang FC coached by Ron Smith and marshalled at the back by former Fulham defender Zesh Rehman. Attendances in the new season are booming. Malaysia and Thailand provide some cause for optimism but it is not enough. Standards are rising \u2013 though the same is true of almost everywhere \u2013 with some decent young talent coming through though it comes through slower than it should, held back as it is by a lack of good coaching at youth levels. Youth development, or the lack of it, is perhaps the biggest failing of all with too much meddling, politics, short-sightedness and not enough investment in the right areas and patience.  It will happen one day. Not in time for the 2015 Asian Cup or 2018 World Cup and probably a little beyond that but one day, south east Asia is going to shake off the politics, the incompetence, the corruption, the short-sightedness and the parochialism and become a genuine power in Asia with new heroes.", "publicationDate": "2014-02-13T02:00:57Z", "tags": ["A-League", "Asia Pacific", "Australia sport", "Sport", "Football"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/feb/13/south-east-asian-football-continues-to-slumber", "title": "South-east Asian football continues to slumber", "sentences": ["It\u2019s hard to take a taxi in Bangkok after a Thailand game and not be told that the team needs a modern version of legendary 80s striker Piyapong Pue-on.", "The club from just north of Bangkok are setting standards in the Thai Premier League along with Buriram United."]}, {"article": "From grappling with runaway crocodiles to avoiding electrocution, a new mobile phone app aims to teach children across the Asia-Pacific region how to stay safe when floods strike. Following the deluge in Thailand in 2011, which killed more than 800 people, the UN agency Unesco&apos;s Bangkok office has teamed up with software developers OpenDream to create Sai Fah: The Flood Fighter. Players can follow the cartoon hero Sai Fah as he battles a flood on his way to meet his mother, with each level of the game offering a lesson in flood safety. Gaming is hugely popular among Thai youth. A recent study found that 72% of youngsters own a mobile phone and 49% use their device for gaming. &quot;In Thailand, people love mobiles, particularly iPhones and Android, so this was the target audience,&quot; explains Ichiro Miyazawa, the Unesco Bangkok programme specialist for literacy and lifelong learning. &quot;We wanted to make characters in the game cute so people feel an attachment to them.&quot; Sai Fah: The Flood Fighter was launched in Thai language last month; this week the game was released in English on iOS and Android platforms. OpenDream&apos;s project manager, Nathalie Sajda, says the biggest challenge while designing the game was balancing entertainment with education: &quot;To integrate learning lessons in a fun interactive way with the player \u2013 this is what makes the game interesting.&quot;     Unesco hopes Sai Fah will be rolled out in Thai schools    The game has 22 lessons, many of which are based on real-life scenarios. &quot;There&apos;s a moment in the game where Sai Fah receives information that the city is safe as it is surrounded by a dam. But he later sees that something hits the dam and breaks it \u2013 this is based on a real-life story,&quot; Sajda explains. &quot;It is important to have real-life understanding of what kind of situations a child or adult can encounter during a flood.&quot; Players are also briefed on how to limit indoor hazards, such as preventing toilets and pipes from bringing dirty floodwater into homes. There are several apps designed to alert phone users of impending natural disasters, but Miyazawa believes Sai Fah: The Flood Fighter is the first of its kind to educate young people through &quot;gamification&quot; \u2013 applying typical elements of game playing such as scoring points and earning rewards to make the experience fun and engaging. Other organisations involved in disaster relief have also got in on the act. Save the Children has an app that allows users to step into the shoes of aid workers \u2013 but it is aimed at educating children about the relief effort, not crisis management. Games such as Disaster Island, launched this week by the British Red Cross, teaches users how to cope during a natural disaster, but it&apos;s an interactive video rather than a mobile app. The Thai language version of Sai Fah: Flood Fighter has been downloaded more than 11,000 times, and there are plans to promote the English version in flood-prone areas across the Asia-Pacific region.     Sai Fah has been downloaded more than 11,000 times    Youngsters who sampled the game at an event held by the Thai education ministry last month gave the app the thumbs-up. &quot;It&apos;s a very fun game and the lessons I learned can be applied to daily life,&quot; said nine-year-old Thamphitak Rakwiratham. The first player to complete all levels, Natchalita Nilkeaw, 10, said: &quot;This is so much fun! I learned flood survival skills by doing the challenges. It&apos;s different from other internet games because this game teaches kids practical lessons. Will recommend to my friends.&quot; Miyazawa hopes Sai Fah will be rolled out in schools nationwide, once the government&apos;s policy to provide Thailand&apos;s 9 million pupils with a tablet computer is implemented. &quot;That&apos;s something we want to push [and have discussed with] the ministry of education,&quot; he says. &quot;We understand the tablet computer has not been used effectively at school, and we wonder if we can install this type of app in tablets \u2013 [which will provide] a good opportunity for kids to play, have discussions and acquire more knowledge [on flood management].

Even the usually hit-and-miss management style of Adelaide United has delivered clear strategy with Josep Gombau given imprimatur to effect change, and the dividends are paying off. Adelaide are starting to find their feet as a unit, mixing the requisite A-League work ethic and physicality with some impressive Latin-flavoured flamboyance. The likes of Marcelo Carrusca, Fabio Ferreira et al are now dazzling with regularity, as evidenced by their hugely impressive showing against Central Coast Mariners.  It is easy to imagine the Reds making a splash in the finals. Elsewhere though, the lack of planning and foresight continues to cause pain as predicted by many for the likes of Sydney FC and Perth Glory. And you sense, especially in the case of the former, the wait for a common sense long-term approach will be interminable. As Johnny would no doubt have said: \u201cI told you so\u201d.  The future is Asia? Geelong was the unlikely setting for yet for another demonstration of the AFC Champions League\u2019s value and potential. Melbourne Victory\u2019s incident-filled win over Thailand\u2019s Muangthong United offered a certain extra layer of colour and intrigue that, by definition, the A-League cannot match. The visitors\u2019 unusual pre-match experiences \u2013 a denied entry visa and conflicting reports of their coach\u2019s exit \u2013 were seemingly chalked down as international football gamesmanship. On the field there was, as invariably seems to be the case in Asian competition, a certain near-boiling point tension, possibly stoked by different cultural approaches to the way football is played. Cultural differences, like beauty one might say, is in the eye of the beholder. Certainly Melbourne Victory coach Kevin Muscat had not been a fan of the competition in the past. Not for the first time, Thai football has shown itself to be dynamic, entertaining and boasting great potential. The past two seasons have seen Buriram United defeat Chinese cash-splashers Guangzhou Evergrande and oil-rich Uzbek equivalents Bunyodkor among other scalps. The Socceroos, of course, were also given almighty scares by the \u2018War Elephants\u2019 in Brisbane and Bangkok on the road to Brazil.  For Melbourne Victory qualification for the group stage means an extra six matches. How this will affect them \u2013 as well as fellow qualifiers Central Coast Mariners and Western Sydney Wanderers \u2013 during the business end of the A-League season remains to be seen. Australia\u2019s involvement in Asia has typically been half-hearted, though understandable to a degree given the extra travel and lack of financial recompense. Nevertheless the competition is here to stay so it is time to buy in. Saturday\u2019s night\u2019s match was the 100th featuring an A-League side. Only one local club, Adelaide, could categorically say they have been committed to the Asian experience. That Adelaide, who reached the continental final in 2008, have won more matches (17) than the other A-League clubs combined (14), speaks volumes.  Dark skies clear marginally for the Sky Blues               These are tough times to be a Sydney FC fan. Do you support your team and hope they do well, allowing the current regime to stagger on and somehow suddenly find the right formula? Or do you secretly, or not so secretly, hope they lose in the hope of establishing some sort of Ground Zero? Though apparently according to some, paying your money at the gate means one must also be an unquestioning cheerleader. After last week\u2019s \u201ctoxic\u201d atmosphere and show of rebellion from The Cove \u2013 not to mention a splash of rain \u2013 it was little surprise when Sydney FC drew their smallest crowd of the season. Although the reported figure of 11,160 raised eyebrows and drew several press box comparisons to the creative crowd counting more commonly adopted in the NRL. Numbers in The Cove looked so slim that protesters struggled to find enough people to lift their \u2018SFC board we want action not words\u2019 sign. As a protest it was about as confrontational and hard-hitting as a strongly-worded leaflet campaign. For all the negativity there are positives from the match, thanks in part to the generosity of Perth Glory, who now assume the mantle of the league\u2019s other most out-of-of-form side. Perfectly timed cavalry have arrived for Sydney in the shape of an artist and artisan; one-time teenage ball juggling prodigy Terry Antonis and the terrifying Sasa Ognenovski. Whether it is enough to undo some of the inexplicable self-harm done in midweek is another story. A rich tapestry The battle of the football codes is an ongoing discussion point, one rarely had in other countries. Indeed, the sporting landscape of Australia is arguably a unique one. The broadest of broad churches is of course one of football\u2019s distinctions. Being an A-League football fan has the potential to provide an insight into a foreign culture, without ever having to flick on a Silvio Rivier SBS doco. A Lithuanian, a Serbian and a Korean walk into a bar is more likely to be a couple of A-League imports swapping stories post-match, than a borderline dad joke. Players from 25 nationalities are now in the A-League, with Serbians this season\u2019s biggest movers. Saturday night\u2019s match-up between Sydney FC and Perth Glory featured four Serb imports. The previous time that happened in a National League game was when the now-sadly defunct Footscray JUST took the field in 1985. With JUST being an abbreviation of Jugoslav United Soccer Team that was perhaps less surprising. Phoenix no-longer rising, grounded Jets take off Going into the weekend matches, Wellington Phoenix were the best A-League team of 2014. Brisbane Roar were imperious leaders who were threatening to make their lead insurmountable. Yet they both somehow managed to lose, spectacularly in the case of Wellington Phoenix, against what was the league\u2019s basket case until a few short weeks ago. The Roar for their part, were undone by arguably the competition\u2019s most of out-of form side. Only once in the 37-year history of Australia\u2019s national leagues has the bottom side won by more than five. That was achieved, somewhat ironically by Wellington at the expense of Gold Coast United in 2009. The A-League is a strange beast, one prone to such unlikely scenarios, and one less likely to occur without a salary cap.

In Perth, Fringe World showcases these works that can be small, rough-and-ready, and \u2013 hopefully \u2013 every bit as affecting as their big international festival counterparts. It might take a bit of a hunt to find the gems, but the joy is in the chase. Here are our picks of the final week \u2013 let us know which shows have impressed you to date. Between the Cracks Yana Alana, the \u201cdiva extraordinaire\u201d alter ego of performer Sarah Ward, burst on to Australia\u2019s cabaret scene at the 2007 Melbourne Fringe, and has since played festivals all over the country, picking up a host of awards. More recently, she\u2019s been sharing the stage with La Soir\u00e9e and Finucane &amp; Smith\u2019s Glory Box. With a personality this huge though, it\u2019s a real treat to get her full show. Ward\u2019s cabaret is known for being political, sexual, feminist and hilarious, and Between the Cracks won outstanding reviews at last year\u2019s Melbourne Cabaret festival. With a 10:45pm timeslot and an 18+ rating, anything could happen \u2013 and probably will. \u2022 The West Australian Spiegeltent, 20\u201323 February Squidboy     Squidboy: Sitting somewhere between comedy and clowning, it\u2019s packed with delights and an emotional punch. Photograph: PR/Fringe World    The low-fi, slightly dorky, lone, probably bearded, male storyteller is so ubiquitous at fringe festivals the he almost needs his own category in the program.  In Perth, the star turn in this genre is Squidboy. New Zealand-raised, London-based performer Trygve Wakenshaw has been touring this show about \u201can imaginary friend who makes imaginary friends who make imaginary enemies\u201d for two years across Australia and Europe, so Perth audiences should expect to be treated to a production that\u2019s firmly found its feet.

Little y aims to \u201ccreate dynamic and honest theatre that resonates with, inspires and cultivates a Generation Y audience\u201d \u2013 often best realised when done by Gen Y themselves.

The civil court of Thailand ruled that some orders issued by the prime minister and a special security command centre under an emergency decree were illegal because they would violate the protesters&apos; constitutional rights. The prohibited orders included bans on gatherings of five or more people and the use of certain roads by the demonstrators. The court also prohibited the government from using force to crack down on the protesters. But the court also rejected a demand by the opposition that it revoke the state of emergency, saying it was within the executive branch&apos;s power to enforce such a law. The ruling by the civil court could complicate handling by the prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, of more than three months of mass opposition protests, although her government had already pledged to avoid using violence against the demonstrators. On Wednesday, protesters besieged the Thai prime minister&apos;s temporary offices in Bangkok&apos;s northern suburbs and vowed to hunt her down until she resigns. &quot;Wherever she is, wherever she sleeps, we will go after her,&quot; protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban said of the embattled Yingluck. &quot;[We] must intensify our fight and we will attack Shinawatra businesses and their funding sources.&quot; Protesters have been calling for Yingluck&apos;s resignation since November under the banner of the People&apos;s Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC), which aims to install an unelected &quot;people&apos;s council&quot; to institute political reform, citing government corruption. The PDRC has been leading a Bangkok &quot;shutdown&quot; for the past month during which demonstrators have occupied government ministries, public parks and major intersections, cut off power to ruling MPs&apos; homes and and cemented shut the gates to Yingluck&apos;s Government House. Yingluck \u2013 whose Puea Thai party won a landslide election in 2011 \u2013 has consequently been ruling Thailand from temporary offices and had hoped this week to be able to return to her normal office in Dusit. But after Tuesday&apos;s violence, in which four protesters and one police officer were killed in a gun and grenade attack after police attempted to remove demonstrators from protest sites, both she and her cabinet ministers stayed away from all offices. Pro-government &quot;redshirts&quot; offered on Wednesday to provide offices and security personnel to the embattled government should it wish to move up to Chiang Mai, Yingluck&apos;s hometown and a major base of voter support. &quot;If the government is unable to work in Bangkok, Chiang Mai is ready to serve as the new headquarters,&quot; redshirt leader Petchawat Wattanapongsirikul told English-language daily paper The Nation. Until Tuesday, the Thai government had exercised considerable restraint against the protesters in an attempt to diminish the possibility of a military coup. But the army, which supports the monarchy and the old-school Bangkok establishment, has said it will intervene only if the police are unable to maintain order and told Reuters that it would act only upon government request. &quot;Our strategy has not changed and is still to provide support to police,&quot; said Colonel Werachon Sukonhapatipak. &quot;We have no intention of deploying extra troops. If the government needs extra help with security, it has to ask us and so far it has not asked for reinforcements.&quot; More than 180 demonstrators have been arrested, 15 people killed and several hundred injured, since protests began in November.

Their Thai classics, such as green curry, look delicious if a little bit tricky to cook, but the chilli beef stir-fry is more simple. &quot;It&apos;ll blow your plugs off,&quot; promises Dave as the hirsute pair nearly explode at the promise of their spicy creation. Hannah Verdier Henry VIII &amp; Anne: The Lovers Who Changed History8pm, Channel 5 With so many history shows having been devoted to Henry VIII and his descendants in recent years, is there really anything more to say about the link-with-Rome-busting romance between Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn? Actually, yes: Dr Suzannah Lipscomb&apos;s two-part documentary focuses on the couple&apos;s relationship, offering a nuanced picture of their lives. That said, Lipscomb is at times handicapped by a lack of primary sources and dramatic reconstructions that distract rather than illuminate. Jonathan Wright Bible Hunters9pm, BBC2 In the 19th century, a few scholars realised that, for a book purporting to be the definitive testament of an omniscient deity, the Bible was weirdly ambiguous. Jeff Rose&apos;s series retraces their quest to figure out how the Gospels came to be gospel. Their efforts weren&apos;t universally popular, especially when they found early Bibles riddled with revisions. An exploration of the beginnings of the split between the literal and metaphorical readings of the most influential book ever written, whoever wrote it.  Andrew Mueller Big Ballet9pm, Channel 4 The final part of Wayne Sleep&apos;s ballet experiment and it&apos;s D-day for the larger ladies and gentlemen making their debuts in a special production of Swan Lake. Wayne and ballet coach Monica Loughman are determinedly whipping their amateur dancers into shape in the fear that ballet bigwigs will chortle their way through the performance. Unfortunately, ballets don&apos;t seem particularly TV-friendly, so we&apos;ll have to take Wayne and Monica&apos;s word on whether it&apos;s a triumph. Rachel Aroesti The Smoke9pm, Sky1 Set at London&apos;s Mile End fire station, this promising new drama stars Jamie Bamber as firefighter Kev Allison, who suffers terrible burns in a brutally incendiary opening sequence. He also comes under attack from a yob in the tower block where the fire broke out. He and his crew are complex heroes, a lairy mob with fraught domestic lives. But it&apos;s Bamber who dominates as Allison, still suffering after-effects nine months on from the traumatic blaze. Not one but two quite shocking, quite literal reveals at the end should keep you watching. David Stubbs The White Slums: Reggie Yates&apos; Extreme South Africa9pm, BBC3 In the first of three programmes on South Africa, Reggie Yates pitches a tent in Coronation Park, a camp where marginalised white people are living well below the poverty line. In the 20 years since Apartheid ended, affirmative action has apparently left some whites worse off, but Yates is keen to contrast this perceived injustice with the institutionalised brutality inflicted on black people. Rachel Aroesti The Man Who Fought The Planners: The Story Of Ian Nairn10pm, BBC4 An RAF pilot turned crusading architecture journalist, Nairn honed his unique take on planning from the air. What he saw was a merging of town and country into an unprepossessing median state. This, as he called it in Outrage \u2013 his revolutionary 1955 cover story for the Architectural Review \u2013 was &quot;Subtopia&quot;.

I mean that literally: \u2018selfie\u2019 was chosen as the single word that defined the entire year. There were selfies in space. There were spinoff \u2018lelfie\u2019 trends. And selfies sparked a \u2018global phenomenon\u2019, which is a term journalists use to describe a subgroup of people doing something on the internet. (Remember planking?) This so-called phenomenon is likely to still remain a phenomenon in 2014. Thanks, Obama.  But what does \u2018phenomenon\u2019 mean in this case, when people have been taking selfies in one form or another for hundreds of years? A computer science professor and his team at the City University of New York wanted to see if selfies actually lived up to the hype, and see if this particular form of self expression is as big a part of the social web as it seems. For one week in December \u2013 the same week as Obama\u2019s infamous Nelson Mandela memorial selfie \u2013 Lev Manovich and his team used a social data tool called Gnip to collect and then analyse 656,000 photos from the central parts of five cities around the world: New York City, Bangkok, Moscow, Sao Paolo and Berlin.      CUNY's 'Selfiecity' project sorts thousands of selfies by pose, head tilt, mood ... and city Photograph: /Selfiecity.net    Facial recognition software helped the team isolate individual selfies, and using using Instagram\u2019s API, researchers created Selfiexploratory, an interactive project that displays several data points Monvich\u2019s team analyzed: age, sex and the degree of a selfie snapper\u2019s head tilt, among them. The results show that selfie aficionados in Bangkok skew younger than those in, say, Berlin. People in Moscow smile far less than their happier, more expressive counterparts in Sao Paulo. And, in all cities analyzed, selfie-takers are overwhelmingly female, though Manovich notes the balance is more equal in the US in general. But perhaps most importantly, the team found that only 3 to 5% of each of those city\u2019s total images were selfies.  The data\u2019s not perfect. There was no way to really distinguish between tourist at Grand Central station and a Manhattan resident, for example: \u201cWe can use some of Instagram data to guess this \u2013 but there is no way to know this exactly in many cases,\u201d Manovich wrote in an email. But no matter where the photo is taken, the data that selfies actually may not be as much of our collective digital culture as we realize and internet users aren\u2019t as narcissistic as we might like to believe. Or at least they weren\u2019t that week in December.  And now, some anecdotal observations: New York lives up to its melting pot reputation as it appears to be home to the the most racially diverse crowd of selfie-ers. The world could stand to use many more beard selfies. And awesome eyewear is perhaps the real global phenomenon here. See for yourself. Here\u2019s a video sampling of the photos from around the world:       More info on the project is here.  What do you think about the study\u2019s results?

What your city says about your \u2018selfies\u2019  You thought it wasn\u2019t possible to say more about \u2018selfies\u2019, or analyse them any further. And you were wrong. The website Selfiecity compiles the investigations of a team led by Dr Lev Manovich, professor of computer science at the City University of New York.

Cairo: the myth of a city on the verge of explosion Any report about Cairo invariably begins with a description of Cairo as \u201cteeming, noisy, dusty and polluted\u201d, a massive city full of street vendors and parked cars on the pavements, and pedestrians walking amongst traffic, writes Jon Argaman in Jadaliyya. Numbers back this up: in 2012, Egypt\u2019s national statistics agency estimated Cairo\u2019s population density at 45,000 per square kilometre, roughly 1.5 times that of Manhattan. Argaman argues this has seeded the widespread idea that Egypt must be uncrowded for it to be sustainable, and that this assumption has allowed state officials to disengage from the problems and concerns of the city and the people who live in it. Read the piece for an analysis of how this vision perpetuates social inequalities and, instead of tackling them, envisages poor people living somewhere else \u2013 namely, the desert. 3. City data and the counterintuitive nature of suicide A group of computational anthropologists, led by Hygor Piaget Melo at the Federal University of Cear\u00e1 in Brazil, have studied the rate at which homicides, suicides and deaths from traffic accidents increase against the population size for all cities in Brazil and each county in the US, as this Technology Review article explains. The results have been surprising. Murders increase with population, so big cities have more per head than smaller ones. The rate of deaths from traffic accidents is the same regardless of the size of the city. And, most striking of all, the number of suicides per capita is higher in smaller cities. One reason proposed is the social nature of suicide; that \u201cthe kind of emotional intensity associated with suicide might dissipate more easily in big cities, where there are more people to shoulder the burden\u201d. 4.

In the early 1970s, he was a subeditor. I marvelled as he checked the stories before they were printed. They were laid out in copper typeface and he whipped through them at a rate of knots reading backwards. I can still smell the ink and hear the whirring presses, and remember hundreds of newspapers flying off the machines, the paper still warm. It was a spellbinding environment and one where I felt at home from a young age. Dad was, and still is, passionate about the industry. He&apos;s almost 80 now, and couldn&apos;t have been prouder and more encouraging when I decided not to go to university but to start work at a weekly paper as a junior reporter. I&apos;d worked at his paper as Saturday tea girl since the age of 14, but the defining moment was going on my first interview with Dad when I was 16 and still at school. Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean had won gold at the Sarajevo Winter Olympics in 1984 for their Bolero routine, and came to Grimsby \u2013 my home town \u2013 to do an exhibition skate, just after their win. Dad secured an exclusive chat with them, and I wore him down to let me go. I promised I would observe, but the temptation was simply too great when they walked into the room. I loved ice-skating, they were my heroes, and I couldn&apos;t wait to start firing questions at them. They were really kind and generous-spirited \u2013 not at all fazed by a 16 year old asking the questions. Dad and I went home and wrote the story together. I&apos;ll never forget the thrill of seeing our words in print the next day with his byline. Now an ITV presenter, I shared this old black and white photo with Jayne and Chris last year. We all had a good laugh about how young we looked in the photo. That chat 30 years ago was the start of what has been, and remains, an exciting career for me. I feel blessed to have made a living out of telling people&apos;s stories. Helen Fospero Playlist: Our restless family of wanderers Wand&apos;rin&apos; Star by Lee Marvin &quot;I was born under a wand&apos;rin&apos; star / I was born under a wand&apos;rin&apos; star / Wheels are made for rollin&apos; / Mules are made to pack&quot;            This is a song that my dad took to heart. It was sung by Lee Marvin in the film Paint Your Wagon in 1970, the year we emigrated to South Africa. I remember watching the film during the voyage from Southampton to Port Elizabeth. Maybe the captain had a wry sense of humour, as the film tells the story of earlier migrants in the Californian gold rush. Lee Marvin played a lone drifter, and now I see the song as a bit sociopathic. &quot;Do I know where hell is, hell is in hello.&quot; Not that Dad is antisocial. But he sees himself as a wanderer. Born in Glasgow, he spent part of his childhood in Canada and British Guiana, where his father was a Presbyterian minister. After university in Fife, his own career led him to move around for work, including two sorties to South Africa before we settled in Yorkshire, where my brothers and I started secondary school. Later, he retired to Scotland. I think we are a restless family. His sister tried living in Newfoundland, India and Ghana, before she too settled down. And because we grew up seeing Dad as a wanderer, we were surprised when she put forward a different view at his 80th birthday party. She said her family had looked on his house in Yorkshire as a link with &quot;home&quot;. His settled life became a fixed point in her own wandering life. &quot;Home is made for comin&apos; from, for dreams of goin&apos; to \u2026&quot; Which, in the long run, have come\u00a0true. David Nicol We love to eat: Angel Delight fruit faces Ingredients 1 sachet of Angel Delight (preferably butterscotch)Half a pint of full milk1 bananaWhichever other fruit you may have lying around \u00a0     Butterscotch Angel Delight fruit face.    Mix the Angel Delight and milk. Leave it to set in the fridge for a few minutes. Cut the banana into slices and use one slice to make the mouth. Use whichever fruit you have to make the eyes and nose. A glace cherry is best for the nose and green grapes for the eyes \u2013 see my photograph for reference, made with butterscotch flavour. \u00a0Growing up in Walsall in the mid 80s, our Saturday tea (the meal you eat at approximately 5pm \u2013 it isn&apos;t called dinner or supper in the West Midlands) was always chips, fish fingers, beans and two slices (never more, never fewer) of bread and butter. When Mom (that&apos;s the West Midlands spelling \u2013 it isn&apos;t Mum) brought the dessert dishes out of the kitchen, my dad, sister and I all knew we were going to get Angel Delight. But which flavour? Was it to be banana, strawberry or, my favourite, butterscotch? And what would the face be made of? We could easily guess, as there were never many options. We always had a large tub of glace cherries in the cupboard \u2013 possibly left over from Mom&apos;s Christmas trifle. They were used for the nose. There was only one option for the mouth. A banana, cut lengthways, and then halved \u2013 depending on how much room there was across the dish. No other fruit would do the job. The eyes were where my mom would let her imagination go wild. For the weeks leading up to Christmas it was two segments of a satsuma. Christmas week itself, it would be walnuts. The authentic choice was white grapes. Mostly though, it would be two more slices of banana \u2013 cut sideways. Recently, I moved to Bangkok. The first parcel I received from Mom and Dad contained three sachets of butterscotch Angel Delight. I made it straight away, minus the fruit face. It just wouldn&apos;t taste the same without Mom&apos;s touch.

Heading to the morgue to identify his son Korawit, four, and daughter Patcharakorn, six \u2013 killed when a grenade exploded outside a shopping mall in central Bangkok \u2013 Tayakorn Yosubon, 33, shook with distress at his loss. &quot;I&apos;m asking and pleading with every side to let my children be the last case [of violence] on Thai soil,&quot; Tayakorn said, his voice breaking. &quot;I didn&apos;t expect my children to be brilliant. I just wanted them to be good people and to be able to get by in this society. But this society, right now, is very cruel. Very, very cruel.&quot; The children, their aunt and nine-year-old cousin had gone out to eat and were jumping into a tuk-tuk on a busy street when the grenade exploded. The cousin suffered brain and lung damage and is in intensive care. A day earlier, a five-year-old girl was killed in an attack at an anti-government PDRC rally in Trat, eastern Thailand. In a Facebook post, the embattled prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, who has not been seen in public for nearly a week, condemned the attacks as &quot;terrorist acts for political gains&quot; and vowed to investigate who was responsible. &quot;It&apos;s time we make an effort to talk together \u2026 and stop turning away from each other,&quot; she said on Monday, a clear reference to the protesters&apos; refusals to negotiate with her government. Police have made no arrests over the weekend&apos;s violence. More than 20 people have been killed and roughly 700 injured since protests against Yingluck began in November. Unicef has urged Thai parents to keep their children away from protest sites. Anti-government demonstrators have besieged ministries, threatened to take Yingluck hostage, taken over public parks and intersections and, most recently, called for a nationwide boycott of Shinawatra businesses. Yingluck, who won a landslide election victory in 2011 but is now ruling Thailand from an undisclosed location outside Bangkok, is being investigated for her alleged role in a floundering $1bn rice-pledging scheme, and faces opposition from the constitutional court and election commission. Yingluck&apos;s brother Thaksin was deposed in 2006 by a military coup, and a proxy Thaksin government was removed from power in 2008 by the courts. In 2010 more than 90 people were killed and 2,000 injured when pro-government red shirts took over parts of Bangkok and were met with force by the then government. The man leading the current protests, Suthep Thaugsuban, was at the time the deputy premier, and is now facing murder charges for his alleged role in the violent crackdown. On Sunday, red shirts in the north-east of the country said dividing the nation between the largely pro-government north and anti-government south may be the only way forward. &quot;If we can&apos;t change things, it&apos;s better to divide the country,&quot; said a red shirt representative, Siriwat Jupatmattha. &quot;Suthep lives in the south, we live in the north. If we have to accomplish this division through civil war, we&apos;ll do it.&quot; But Sombat Thamrongthanyawong, a core PDRC leader and former rector of the National Institute of Development Association, told the Guardian: &quot;The PDRC never use any violent means. They [red shirts] are calling for a violent means. That is the opposite from what the PDRC has called for. Who, in history, has used more violence? That&apos;s the important point.&quot; Thitinan Pongsudhirak, an analyst at the Institute of Security and International Studies, said: &quot;The escalating violence in recent days has crossed a threshold which is likely to beget more violence. It looks like the mechanics of conflict are so locked-in that it is difficult to do much else. We are still on a freefall and I would not be surprised if we saw more violence in the coming days from various sides.&quot; The army leader, General Prayuth Chao-ocha, said on Monday that the military would not intervene, but many in Thailand are bracing for worse to come.", "publicationDate": "2014-02-24T19:25:40Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/24/three-children-killed-thai-violence", "title": "Three children killed in Thai violence", "sentences": ["Heading to the morgue to identify his son Korawit, four, and daughter Patcharakorn, six \u2013 killed when a grenade exploded outside a shopping mall in central Bangkok \u2013 Tayakorn Yosubon, 33, shook with distress at his loss.", "Yingluck, who won a landslide election victory in 2011 but is now ruling Thailand from an undisclosed location outside Bangkok, is being investigated for her alleged role in a floundering $1bn rice-pledging scheme, and faces opposition from the constitutional court and election commission.", "In 2010 more than 90 people were killed and 2,000 injured when pro-government red shirts took over parts of Bangkok and were met with force by the then government."]}, {"article": "If one lesson can be drawn from the spate of street revolts rippling around the globe from south-east Asia to Europe to Latin America, it is that every revolution is different. At the same time, it is plain that in the modern, interconnected world, grassroots uprisings cross-fertilise and often have similarities. Turkey, Ukraine, Thailand, Venezuela and Bosnia-Herzegovina are all middle-income democracies with elected leaders besieged by people angry at misgovernment, corruption and economic sclerosis. These days it is no longer just dictators who have something to fear from the crowd. The belief that violently propelled revolutionary change is transnational, even universal in nature, and uniform in origin and aspiration, is seductive, persistent and historically absurd. Its antecedents include the lost era of Marx and Lenin when the &quot;workers of the world&quot; espoused the dictatorship of the proletariat. Wordsworth&apos;s joyful reaction to the French revolution \u2013 &quot;Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, But to be young was very Heaven!&quot; \u2013 , which he fondly believed threatened the ancien regime across all Europe, shows how lasting, powerful \u2013 and illusory \u2013 is the idea of ubiquitous, socially-levelling, personally liberating rebellion. Following this deceptive formula, the revolts that roiled the Arab world, starting in Tunisia in 2010, were initially lumped together under the optimistic tag of the Arab spring. This phrase is not often heard nowadays. The supposed pan-Arab battle for freedom and democracy, as it was wishfully interpreted in the west, mutated into a string of separately defined conflicts involving violent coup and counter-coup in Egypt, national fracturing in Libya, harsh repression in Bahrain and catastrophic civil war in Syria. In democracies in revolt, the differences are similarly instructive. Ukraine&apos;s uprising is increasingly taking on an ethnic tinge. The nationalist west against the ethnically Russian east. In Thailand, the principal animus is old-fashioned class warfare, pitting relatively well-to-do middle-class city dwellers against the subsidised rural masses. In Turkey, the primary focus of the protesters&apos; rage has been one man, the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. &quot;While mayor of Istanbul, Erdo\u011fan quipped that democracy was like a street car: &apos;You ride it as far as you need and then you get off.&apos; He has proven himself a man of his word, as he has moved to consolidate power, eviscerate the judiciary, crush free speech, curb the media and imprison political opponents,&quot; said commentator Michael Rubin. Seen this way, Erdo\u011fan appeared not so much a lesser version of Ukraine&apos;s Viktor Yanukovych - he has not, so far, resorted to shooting demonstrators - and more the Euro-Asian equivalent of Venezuela&apos;s Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who also stands accused of trampling civic freedoms. As in Thailand, Maduro&apos;s most vehement critics hail from the middle class who revile the so-called Bolivarian socialist revolution of his mentor, the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. As in Cambodia and Bangladesh, two other restless nations, a rapidly deteriorating economy, food prices and high crime rates are also key elements in unrest in Venezuela, said analyst Juan Carlos Hidalgo. &quot;Despite receiving over $1tn in oil revenues since 1999, the government has run out of cash and now relies heavily on printing money to finance itself. The result is the highest inflation rate in the world.&quot; Venezuela is, however, no Ukraine, other analysts say. Another common denominator may be the peculiar position these countries occupy in the list of nations by wealth. Venezuela had a per capita GDP of $13,480 (\u00a38,080) in 2012, placing it 73rd on the IMF&apos;s list. Turkey was 68th, with $14,812. Thailand was 92nd, Ukraine 106th. Although not exactly wealthy, groups who might be termed upwardly-mobile revolutionaries can afford the luxury of protest in a way previous generations in these countries could not. A mismanaged economy, corrupt privatisations, high youth unemployment and croneyism among the ruling elites also lay behind the recent, sudden eruption of violent protest in Bosnia. In this case, there was evident crossover with Turkey, and as in Bangkok, many Sarajevo residents have clearly lost confidence in their complex postwar political system. Despite its recent history, however, Bosnia&apos;s current grievances are economic, not ethnic. &quot;When Bosnia abandoned communism about two decades ago, officials devised a plan to privatise state-owned companies in a way they hoped would avoid mass layoffs for state workers,&quot; wrote Aida Cerkez. &quot;More than 80% of privatisations have failed. Many well-connected tycoons have swept into these companies, stripping them of their assets, declaring bankruptcy and leaving thousands without jobs or with minimal pay.&quot; Hence the anger on the streets. Ineffective, undeveloped or non-existent institutions, misgovernance, deteriorating economic performance, failing social cohesion, the alienation of younger generations, ethnic and nationalist tensions and a lack of faith in democratic processes \u2013 these are among the common factors sparking the rebellions of 2014. No one country or revolution is typical, but given these criteria, it is not hard to predict where unrest may next break out. Argentina is a prime candidate for trouble under the divisive, leftist leadership of President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. Her increasingly anti-democratic stance, her government&apos;s corruption scandals and her efforts to deflect attention by picking fights with Britain over the Falkland s are ominous. Experience elsewhere suggests an economy in freefall and overseen by a nationalist demagogue is a recipe for revolt.", "publicationDate": "2014-02-27T15:38:24Z", "tags": ["Protest", "World news", "Ukraine", "Thailand", "Venezuela", "Turkey", "Bosnia-Herzegovina", "Asia Pacific", "Europe", "Americas", "Middle East and North Africa", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Cambodia", "Bangladesh", "Argentina"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/27/recipe-revolution-ukraine-thailand-venezuela-turkey", "title": "Recipe for revolt: what do Ukraine, Turkey and Thailand have in common?", "sentences": ["In this case, there was evident crossover with Turkey, and as in Bangkok, many Sarajevo residents have clearly lost confidence in their complex postwar political system."]}, {"article": "Image one: Havana Fancy a trip?

Sampras, meanwhile, seemed unclear who he was playing for [Mumbai, along with Rafael Nadal], and said he would have had reservations about joining such a venture during his playing days, as it would have cut into his down time on the Tour.

His ordeal lasted more than 10 months, during which he claims he was forced to work without pay and subjected to beatings by the captain. His plight was uncovered during an investigation into rights abuses in the Thai fishing industry by the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), a UK-based NGO. Thailand is the third-largest exporter of seafood in the world, sending nearly a billion euros (\u00a38.2m) of fish to Europe and more than $1.5bn to the US each year. However, allegations of slavery and forced labour have dogged the sector in recent years. The latest EJF report, Slavery at Sea (pdf), published on Tuesday, follows warnings about brutal labour conditions in the Thai fishing industry sounded by the UN&apos;s International Labour Organisation and Human Rights Watch (pdf). Myo Zaw Do&apos;s case was recorded by the EJF last month, after he managed to escape and take refuge in a temple outside Bangkok. He says he was 20 when he left the small town of Kamarsay Sanpya in Burma to find work. He travelled to the border town of Myawaddy, where he paid traffickers to help him make an illegal crossing into Thailand. He gave brokers $215 upfront and agreed to work off the rest of the fee, $140, in Thailand. He was among a group of 36 migrants from Burma undertaking the long forest trek into Thailand. Three were lost on the way, including an elderly man whom Myo Zaw Do believes was murdered when he became suspicious and refused to continue the journey. Once across the border, the group was split by the traffickers. Eleven young women were divided into those who would be sold to food factories and those who would be sent to nightclubs and brothels, he says. Six men were transferred in two marked police cars, driven by men in plainclothes, to a port south of Bangkok. Realising they had been tricked, the other men refused to work on the boats, but Myo Zaw Do says they were lured, one by one, to work on jobs near the broker&apos;s house. All six ended up aboard a vessel that headed out to sea. &quot;We were sold for $430 per person. I felt very depressed when I ended up on the boat. I felt I was in hell,&quot; Myo Zaw Do told researchers. He described regular beatings, including one in which his head was smashed so hard on to ice on the deck that he was left partially deaf. Although the boat returned to port on occasion, Myo Zaw Do says escape was made hard by the close relationship between the local police and boat operators. Vessel owners would pay bribes to the officers to allow them to keep illegal workers. Escapees were returned to the boats or sold on to others offering a better price. The EJF says Myo Zaw Do&apos;s case is one of several it has uncovered of slavery and extreme exploitation in the Thai fishing sector. &quot;Migrant workers in the Thai fishing industry, many of them trafficked illegally, are suffering terrible abuses and all too often are denied their basic human rights,&quot; says the foundation&apos;s executive director, Steve Trent. &quot;Our governments and the international seafood industry simply cannot continue to ignore this, they must demand immediate reform and action to stop these abuses or refuse Thai seafood that is produced by slaves.&quot; In 2013, the Thai government agreed to tackle trafficking, partly in response to pressure from the US state department, which had the country on its official watchlist for labour abuses. It promised to increase inspection and enforcement. The EJF says its findings show not enough has been done. *Myo Zaw Do is a pseudonym.", "publicationDate": "2014-03-04T12:31:38Z", "tags": ["Global development", "Fishing", "Slavery", "Seafood", "Thailand", "Trade and development", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/mar/04/thai-seafood-industry-burmese-migrant-trafficking-ordeal", "title": "Thai seafood industry censured over Burmese migrant's trafficking ordeal | Felicity Lawrence", "sentences": ["Myo Zaw Do&apos;s case was recorded by the EJF last month, after he managed to escape and take refuge in a temple outside Bangkok.", "Six men were transferred in two marked police cars, driven by men in plainclothes, to a port south of Bangkok."]}, {"article": "The Italian national who was believed to be on flight MH370 has told Thai police that his passport went missing last year from a motorbike rental shop on the tourist island of Phuket, where hundreds of passports are thought to be lost or stolen every year in a black-market racket. Luigi Maraldi, 37, said he was on holiday last summer when he left his passport at an undisclosed rental shop in Patong, the resort island&apos;s tourist centre, only to discover when he later went to collect it that the shop owner had handed it over to a man who &quot;looked similar&quot;. Passports are often asked in exchange for car and motorbike rentals in Phuket \u2013 visited by 12 million tourists every year \u2013 but the island is a hotbed of identity theft, and complaints of stolen and lost passports are rife. According to Italian honorary consul Francesco Pensato said: &quot;We have 250,000 [Italian] tourists a season, so it&apos;s normal that [some] lose a passport.&quot; Pensato confirmed that Maraldi had had his passport stolen in Phuket in July last year, and that the number of the passport used to board the flight was the same as that of the stolen passport \u2013 ruling out any possibility that there was another Luigi Maraldi with the same date of birth who may have been on board. Christian Kozel, the 30-year-old Austrian citizen listed on the flight&apos;s manifest, also had his passport stolen two years ago during a flight from Phuket to Bangkok, the Austrian foreign ministry said. Malaysian officials are now using CCTV footage to try to identify the two travellers, while investigators are also looking into reports that another two passengers may have been travelling on false documents. Just why the men posing as the Italian and Austrian would have used the false documents is still unclear. Terrorism is a possibility, but so is asylum: six Syrians hoping to seek refugee status in Sweden have been detained for over a month at Phuket&apos;s international airport after attempting to fly to Stockholm via Beijing on Greek passports. Local media outlet Phuketwan reported that the group said they had chosen to fly through Phuket and Beijing because other refugees had reached Sweden using the same flight path. The two men on board MH370 had booked onward flights via Beijing to Amsterdam, and then Copenhagen for the &quot;Italian&quot;, and Frankfurt for the &quot;Austrian&quot;. The two men seem to have purchased their one-way tickets at the same time from a travel agency in the Thai beach town Pattaya on Thursday. Both Kozel&apos;s and Maraldi&apos;s passports had been reported stolen and were listed in Interpol&apos;s database, yet the airline did not cross-check the 40m-record database to confirm whether any passengers on flight MH370 were flying on dubious documents. Terrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna from Singapore&apos;s Nanyang Technological University said there were only two categories of travellers using stolen passports: criminals and terrorists. &quot;To blame Malaysian authorities for this is probably unfair \u2013 they have to get it right all the time and potential hijackers just have to get through once,&quot; he added. Malaysia Airlines officials told a press conference on Sunday that terrorism was being investigated as a reason why the plane may have tried to turn back, as reports of potential serious lapses in security at Kuala Lumpur International airport emerged. Just a few months ago, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission and police formed a &quot;flying squad&quot; to address allegations of immigration officers accepting bribes to allow illegal immigrants into the country. At the same time human trafficking gangs were reportedly selling a &quot;Get into Malaysia package&quot; for \u00a3450, in return for which the buyer was smuggled into the country and given a fake &quot;MyKad&quot;, the compulsory identity document for Malaysian citizens. Malaysia&apos;s deputy home minister, Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar, said the government does not deny that &quot;there may be some black sheep among the staff&quot; and added: &quot;Generally, they are good, efficient and honest officers. We will not allow them to be condemned, nor will the department be condemned because of the actions of a few.&quot; The US is expected to investigate the stolen passports once the FBI arrives in Malaysia to assist with the investigation.", "publicationDate": "2014-03-09T19:45:58Z", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH370", "Thailand", "Malaysia", "Asia Pacific", "China", "World news", "Air transport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/09/italian-passport-malaysia-airlines-flight-mh370-stolen-phuket", "title": "Italian's passport used to board flight MH370 was stolen in Phuket", "sentences": ["Christian Kozel, the 30-year-old Austrian citizen listed on the flight&apos;s manifest, also had his passport stolen two years ago during a flight from Phuket to Bangkok, the Austrian foreign ministry said."]}, {"article": "On 30 November 2010, a 39-year-old Pakistani national named Muhammed Ather &quot;Tony&quot; Butt was detained with his Thai girlfriend, Sirikalya Kitbamrung, as they were crossing into Laos from the north-eastern Thai province of Nong Khai. Later that same day, officers from Thailand&apos;s Department of Special Investigations arrested a second Pakistani, Zezan Azzan Butt, 27, in the Rat Burana district of Bangkok. At about the same time, on the other side of the globe, Spanish police were swooping on a series of addresses in Barcelona, arresting six Pakistanis and one Nigerian. The raids were the culmination of a major joint operation, codenamed Alpha, between Thai and Spanish investigators, prompted by the discovery that a suspected member of the al-Qaida-inspired terror cell responsible for several attacks in Madrid \u2013 including the 2004 M-11 train bombings, which killed 191 people and left 1,800 injured \u2013 was travelling on a false passport. Information from that suspect would lead, several years later, to the arrest in September 2009 of an Iranian-born Briton, Ahboor Rambarak Fath, at Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport \u2013 and, eventually, to Tony Butt. Stopped as he got off a flight from Spain, Fath was carrying a bag of 103 stolen European, Canadian and Israeli passports destined, he confessed, for the veritable &quot;small forgery factory&quot; that police found at Butt&apos;s apartment in the hours after his arrest. In one room of the flat, an unnamed DSI agent told the Bangkok Post, officers discovered computers, a high-definition scanner and printer, and more than 1,000 stolen passports, photographs and counterfeit data pages for EU, Canadian, Chinese and Israeli passports, plus assorted sets of US and Schengen visa stickers and stamps. Butt was, in the words of DSI deputy director-general Narat Savetnant, &quot;the kingpin&quot; of a major international gang that stole and falsified passports and then sold them to international criminal groups involved in arms trafficking, human trafficking, illegal immigration \u2013 and terrorism. Beside the Madrid bombers, the gang also allegedly supplied passports to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba group, accused of plotting the 2008 Mumbai attacks that left 164 people dead and more than 300 injured, and to Tamil Tiger separatists in Sri Lanka. Theft of passports in\u00a0Thailand \u2013 and particularly in Phuket \u2013 is a &apos;regular\u00a0occurrence&apos; There is, of course, no evidence that Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which disappeared Friday 7 March just over an hour into its flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Beijing, was the victim of a terror attack. But news that two of the passengers on the flight were travelling on passports stolen in Thailand \u2013 one belonging to Italian Luigi Maraldi, who lost it last August when he left it as collateral for a motorbike rented in Phuket, and the other to Austrian Christian Kozel, who reported his lost in the same area some 18 months earlier \u2013 has focused attention on the country&apos;s booming trade in stolen and falsified passports. Some, certainly, have ended up in the hands of terrorists. In June 2012, the month that Butt was sentenced to 15 years in jail, the DSI smashed another major counterfeiting syndicate, this one accused of issuing some 3,000 falsified passports and visas over the five years of its existence, two of them to Iranians convicted of carrying out a series of botched bomb attacks in Bangkok in February 2012, supposedly aimed at Israeli diplomats. (The counterfeiting gang&apos;s alleged ringleader, Iranian-born Seyed Paknejad, 45, was arrested but jumped bail and fled, on a fake Turkish passport, to Malaysia \u2013 where he was re-arrested last year carrying a startling 17 stolen New Zealand passports. Thailand has subsequently asked for\u00a0his extradition.) The gangs have targeted Thailand mainly because of the very large numbers of European, US and Australian holidaymakers who travel there every year. But the Bangkok Post&apos;s interview with an unnamed DSI agent quoted him as saying the country was also attractive because it is relatively easy to enter and leave; &quot;you can negotiate with some law enforcement people&quot;; and \u2013 importantly \u2013 some local officials have not tended to see the forgery of foreign (as opposed to Thai) passports as a particularly serious offence. The business reportedly originated in the early 80s, when Thai criminal gangs employed hotel staff, tour guides and sex workers to steal not just tourists&apos; traveller&apos;s cheques but also their passports, without which cheques could not be cashed. Once credit cards started replacing traveller&apos;s cheques, the gangs used the expertise they had already gained in the sophisticated techniques of document falsification to become full-service fake document providers, importing passports, driving licences and ID cards from abroad, doctoring them, and selling to anyone prepared to pay. Two passengers on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 were travelling on passports stolen in Thailand One DSI agent, Tinawut Slilapat told Bangkok expat magazine The Big Chilli in 2012 that &quot;around 20&quot; groups, often headed by criminals from south Asia or the Middle East, are currently engaged in various forms of passport fraud in Thailand. They use passports stolen in Thailand but also in countries such as Spain, France and Belgium, add new photographs, data pages and signatures, and sell to customers who either travel to Thailand to buy the documents or send couriers. Almost all the passports are used to commit crimes outside Thailand, Tinawut told the magazine. He said an undoctored stolen passport \u2013 increasingly used by the gangs, who are now dealing in such high volumes that they can afford simply to wait until a potential client shows up of approximately the right age and appearance \u2013 typically sells for between $1,500 and $3,000, depending on its condition, nationality, and the number of years it has left to run. Italian, British, Spanish and other European passports fetch about $1,000, Tinawut said, while Israeli passports cost $1,500-$2,000 and Canadian can go for up to $3,000. &quot;There is still huge demand for passports, and identity fraud is a tool to support other criminal activities,&quot; Tinawut said. &quot;We are talking about a very lucrative revenue source for criminal organisations.&quot; A Hong Kong-based risk consultant, Steve Vickers, confirmed to the Wall Street Journal that &quot;counterfeiting of all sorts of identifications is very widespread, particularly out of Thailand. So it&apos;s pretty easy to pick up a stolen or a counterfeit passport.&quot; Visitors to the south-east Asian country would certainly be advised to watch out for their passports. According to the Foreign Office, some 600 British passports were stolen there in 2012-13, making it the seventh most likely country to lose a British passport (revealingly, in light of Butt&apos;s connections, the country that tops the list is Spain, where more than 5,600 British passports were reported missing last year). A former Australian consul, Larry Cunningham, told the South China Morning Post that the theft of passports in Thailand \u2013 and particularly in Phuket \u2013 is a &quot;regular occurrence&quot;. Some passports were certainly lost, Cunningham said, &quot;falling out of pockets or being genuinely misplaced. But there were also substantial incidents of passports being stolen.&quot; A quick scroll through travellers&apos; internet forums, such as Lonely Planet, shows countless anguished stories of passports lost and presumed stolen \u2013 often from car and motorbike rental agencies. When Maraldi, who called his family to tell them reports of his death on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 had been greatly exaggerated, asked the bike shop where he had left it for his passport back, he was told it had already been handed over to an Italian man who &quot;said Mr Maraldi was his husband&quot;. But a stolen and doctored passport will only work as a travel document if nobody checks it. Both Kozel and Maraldi reported their passports as stolen and the thefts were duly recorded in Interpol&apos;s database of Lost and Stolen Travel Documents (LSTD). Created after the September 11, 2001 terror attack on New York and Washington, the LSTD database now has some 40m entries. The inter-governmental police cooperation organisation says this weekend it is searched more than 800m times a year, mainly by the US, which accessed it 250m times, the UK (120m) and the UAE (50m). &apos;Last year, passengers were able to board planes more than a billion times without having their passports screened against Interpol&apos;s databases&apos; Authorities in many other countries, however, appear to search the database far less often, or not at all. &quot;Last year,&quot; the agency said, &quot;passengers were able to board planes more than a billion times without having their passports screened against Interpol&apos;s databases ... Unfortunately, few member countries systematically search these databases to determine whether a passenger is using a stolen or lost travel document to board a plane.&quot; Interpol said that in the case of Flight MH370: &quot;No checks of the stolen Austrian and Italian passports were made by any country between the time they were entered into Interpol&apos;s database and the departure of the\u00a0flight.&quot; International border control authorities were last reminded to tighten up procedures in 2010, when an Air India Express flight crashed on landing in Mangalore and it transpired that 10 of the 158 passengers and crew on board \u2013 all of whom were killed \u2013 had been travelling on forged or stolen documents, leading to serious concerns about security checks in Dubai, where the flight originated. Ronald Noble, Interpol&apos;s secretary general, was scathing this weekend about the evident lack of any such checks when passengers boarded Flight MH370. &quot;Whilst it is too soon to speculate about any connection between these stolen passports and the missing plane, it is clearly of great concern that any passenger was able to board an international flight using a stolen passport listed in Interpol&apos;s databases,&quot; Noble said. &quot;For years, Interpol has asked why countries should wait for a tragedy to put prudent security measures in place at borders and boarding gates. Now we have a real case where the world is speculating whether the stolen passport holders were terrorists, while Interpol is asking why only a handful of countries are taking care to make sure that persons possessing stolen passports are not boarding international flights. &quot;If Malaysia Airlines and all airlines worldwide were able to check the passport details of prospective passengers against Interpol&apos;s database, we would not have to speculate.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-03-10T18:53:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Immigration and asylum", "UK news", "Crime", "Human trafficking", "Organised crime", "Malaysia Airlines flight MH370", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/10/thailand-trade-fake-passports-crime-gangs-world", "title": "How Thailand's trade in fake passports fuels crime gangs around the world", "sentences": ["Later that same day, officers from Thailand&apos;s Department of Special Investigations arrested a second Pakistani, Zezan Azzan Butt, 27, in the Rat Burana district of Bangkok.", "Information from that suspect would lead, several years later, to the arrest in September 2009 of an Iranian-born Briton, Ahboor Rambarak Fath, at Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport \u2013 and, eventually, to Tony Butt.", "In one room of the flat, an unnamed DSI agent told the Bangkok Post, officers discovered computers, a high-definition scanner and printer, and more than 1,000 stolen passports, photographs and counterfeit data pages for EU, Canadian, Chinese and Israeli passports, plus assorted sets of US and Schengen visa stickers and stamps.", "In June 2012, the month that Butt was sentenced to 15 years in jail, the DSI smashed another major counterfeiting syndicate, this one accused of issuing some 3,000 falsified passports and visas over the five years of its existence, two of them to Iranians convicted of carrying out a series of botched bomb attacks in Bangkok in February 2012, supposedly aimed at Israeli diplomats.", "But the Bangkok Post&apos;s interview with an unnamed DSI agent quoted him as saying the country was also attractive because it is relatively easy to enter and leave; &quot;you can negotiate with some law enforcement people&quot;; and \u2013 importantly \u2013 some local officials have not tended to see the forgery of foreign (as opposed to Thai) passports as a particularly serious offence.", "Two passengers on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 were travelling on passports stolen in Thailand One DSI agent, Tinawut Slilapat told Bangkok expat magazine The Big Chilli in 2012 that &quot;around 20&quot; groups, often headed by criminals from south Asia or the Middle East, are currently engaged in various forms of passport fraud in Thailand."]}, {"article": "The missing Malaysia Airlines plane may have tried to head for another airport, the company said on Tuesday, with the search expanding to land as it entered a fourth day.

Gibson, from Hove, was 19 when he took a break from the course he had just started at Leeds University, in Asian and Pacific studies and international management, to travel around Cambodia. His father, Mike Gibson, said the family was waiting &quot;with bated breath&quot; for more news. The Gibsons have determinedly kept the search for him active, repeatedly visiting, making an appeal on local television and offering a \u00a310,000 reward for information \u2013 all to no avail. The possible breakthrough follows the discovery of bones close to a lake near Poipet, the border town that is believed to have been his last stop in Cambodia. His father, Mike Gibson, said: &quot;On Monday, we were phoned by a private investigator who has a presence in Cambodia and who investigates children who have gone missing. He was notified by border police at Poipet that there had been some human remains found near a lake on the border between Cambodia and Thailand, on the Cambodia side. Over the last couple of days, they have secured it as a crime scene and they have been able to get more bones, including a skull, and they are assembling the skeleton.&quot; But reports in Cambodia say a joint investigation by the national police and provincial authorities has ruled out the remains belonging to Eddie. The Cambodia Daily newspaper quoted provincial police chief Kheng Soum, who said the body belonged to an Asian person. Gibson, who had earlier said the family was waiting &quot;with bated breath&quot; for more news, described the reports as worrying. His son&apos;s dental records are being sent to Cambodia in the hope that they may identify the remains. A pair of underpants was found with the bones, possibly the Calvin Klein brand which he wore. The family has also been told that arm bones may have an old break, as Eddie had. The family believe he was murdered for his travelling money: he may still have had several thousand pounds in cash at the time he disappeared. They last heard from him in an email on 24 October 2004, when he told his mother he was really looking forward to coming home on 1 November: they went joyfully to meet a flight from Bangkok, but he wasn&apos;t on it and was never heard from again. Poipet is a popular crossing point into Thailand for backpackers, but the Tripadvisor website currently carries a warning of numerous scams and the risk of being robbed. Lonely Planet reports that a recent facelift has helped it to partially overcome its status as &quot;the armpit of Cambodia&quot;. In 2006, four officers from Sussex police spent 10 days in Phnom Penh working with the Cambodian police. They interviewed people who had met Gibson during his travels, visited hotels he had stayed at and travelled to Poipet, but they found no trace of him. In 2009, on the fifth anniversary of his disappearance, his father travelled to Cambodia to make a new appeal for information, saying it was inconceivable that nobody knew what had happened to him. His father said. &quot;We do hope it is Eddie so we can bring him home and bring an end to all this not knowing what has happened to him. It&apos;s a strange feeling and, if it&apos;s not him, then it has just relived the whole thing and added to the torture.&quot; DCI Jeff Riley of Sussex police said: &quot;We are aware of the finding of human remains in Cambodia that are currently being examined to see if they could belong to Eddie Gibson. We are continuing to support the Gibson family, as we have since Eddie went missing, and will help them and the Cambodia authorities through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in any way we can to find out what has happened to him.&quot; Four years after he disappeared, his mother, Jo Gibson Clark, said on his family: &quot;It tears you inside out\u00a0\u2026 Before this happened, I didn&apos;t think about that dark side, that anything bad could happen, because it happens to other people. But we&apos;re normal, average people, and it has happened to us, and it sticks you in a dark hole.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-03-19T17:08:00Z", "tags": ["Cambodia", "Asia Pacific", "UK news", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/19/human-bones-cambodia-missing-backpacker-eddie-gibson", "title": "Human bones found in Cambodia could be missing backpacker Eddie Gibson", "sentences": ["They last heard from him in an email on 24 October 2004, when he told his mother he was really looking forward to coming home on 1 November: they went joyfully to meet a flight from Bangkok, but he wasn&apos;t on it and was never heard from again."]}, {"article": "Roberto Mart\u00ednez has claimed Everton can continue to challenge for Champions League qualification despite the financial gulf between the club and Premier League rivals. Everton announced an extension to the club&apos;s shirt sponsorship deal with Thai brewing company Chang on Thursday that could be worth \u00a316m-plus over the next three seasons. The deal is the most lucrative in Everton&apos;s history yet pales in comparison with the terms negotiated by Arsenal (\u00a330m per year), Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City (all \u00a320m per year) and Tottenham Hotspur&apos;s \u00a319m a season from their shirt sponsors. It places Everton, who confirmed the new agreement in Bangkok, in a similar sponsorship bracket to Newcastle United, Aston Villa, Sunderland and bottom-of-the-table Fulham. Mart\u00ednez, however, insists it would take more than a lucrative sponsorship deal to close the financial gap on Chelsea and Manchester City, and has been reassured that money raised will be invested in his squad. Asked if he thought the Chang deal was the best a club of Everton&apos;s size could attract, he said: &quot;The way I assess it is it&apos;s much bigger than we&apos;ve had in the past so we are making progress and we are getting more finance from the same source. &quot;We&apos;re going to continue trying to get the best we can from our resources and I have to find a way for us to be as competitive as we can with the resources we have. Nowadays, if you want to challenge Man City or Chelsea financially it&apos;s not going to come down to getting a good (sponsorship) deal or not, it&apos;s a lot more than that because the disparity in finances is huge. So I&apos;m not too worried about that. &quot;The board has been very supportive, the chairman has been very supportive and he&apos;s allowed me to manage the football club in a way that means everything we produce can be reinvested. That&apos;s all I want. It&apos;s not about the number, it&apos;s what you can do with the finances that come in. Sometimes you&apos;re in a position where you need to meet payments and you can&apos;t reinvest in the squad; that&apos;s not the case at Everton. Whatever comes in can be reinvested in the squad.&quot; Mart\u00ednez has exploited the loan market in his debut season as Everton manager and cited that, plus the club&apos;s productive youth academy, as ways of keeping the club competitive at the top of the Premier League. &quot;There&apos;s no good feeling inferior to others if you haven&apos;t got the same finances as them,&quot; the Everton manager added. &quot;You take what you&apos;ve got in football and take the most from it. That&apos;s why you look at the loan market and you look to youngsters. If you asked me would I like to have more finances, of course, but that doesn&apos;t necessarily guarantee you success. &quot;We need to find a way to challenge and I think the youth we&apos;ve got in this squad, as long as we keep it and keep developing it, is going to be the unknown quantity that will allow us to challenge the other sides who&apos;ve got bigger finances. I don&apos;t think lack of finances will stop us from challenging the top four. There is a way with the quality we&apos;ve got at the club to bridge that gap but a lot is going to come down to how well we can do in the next 10 games because there&apos;s a point when you have to master what you&apos;re good at. &quot;The game against Cardiff was very satisfying from that point of view because we never stopped doing the right things, we were very stubborn in the way we played and we got our rewards in the 92nd minute because we were so good in what we were trying to do. If we can do that over 38 games then I do feel that we can bridge that gap.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-03-20T22:30:01Z", "tags": ["Everton", "Football", "Finances", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/mar/20/roberto-martinez-everton-champions-league-sponsorship-deal", "title": "Roberto Mart\u00ednez: Everton equipped to compete for Champions League", "sentences": ["It places Everton, who confirmed the new agreement in Bangkok, in a similar sponsorship bracket to Newcastle United, Aston Villa, Sunderland and bottom-of-the-table Fulham."]}, {"article": "Image one: Lombard Street, San FranciscoFancy a trip?

He didn&apos;t mean the absence of a coup marked progress; he was reflecting a widespread resignation that without action by some external force \u2013 such as the military \u2013 the crisis being played out in Bangkok risked running the country into the ground. Thailand faces truly existential challenges. It is riven by social, economic, ideological and regional divisions. Resignation seems to give way only to heightened extremism; vituperative intolerance has damaged any prospect of talks. Outside powers should not misinterpret a lull in the streets as progress. Without a concerted attempt to alter course, Thailand remains at risk of tipping into violent confrontation. How did things come to this? The government called elections for 2 February after protests led by former members of the Democrat party persuaded the prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, to withdraw an inflammatory amnesty bill that would have annulled the 2008 abuse-of-power conviction of her brother, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Instead of channelling the dispute into the political arena, protesters occupied Bangkok&apos;s streets, calling for Yingluck&apos;s resignation and an appointed government. Boycotted by the Democrat party, boycotted and disrupted by anti-government protesters, the February poll had no cathartic effect. Yingluck&apos;s administration continues to face pressure from protests, the courts and nominally non-partisan watchdog agencies. Indeed, the constitutional court today voided the elections, throwing yet more uncertainty on an already confused situation. But an appointed government \u2013 an ever more likely proposition \u2013 would almost certainly provoke a backlash by &quot;red shirt&quot; Shinawatra supporters, who have seen every government they elected since 2005 undemocratically removed. Just off-stage, and far more significant to Thailand&apos;s immediate future than either Yingluck or her street-based opponents, are three sets of characters. First, there is Thaksin: to some, a politician who finally gave voice to the aspirations of the rural north and northeast; to others, a Voldemort-like figure who, even in exile, is omnipresent, able and willing to sacrifice the nation to his limitless ambition. Few express a middle line but many miss the fundamental dilemma. Whatever his virtues or sins, Thaksin, politically active, will remain a source of extreme division; but the converse \u2013 that his removal will bring union \u2013 does not hold up. Thaksin is both cause and symptom of Thailand&apos;s irreversible political reality: it is the north and northeast, rather than Bangkok, the Thai establishment and the south, that have the electoral clout to determine who is in government. Second, the military. They&apos;re not shy about politics \u2013 in 2006 they ousted Thaksin \u2013 or in stamping down protests, as they did with extreme prejudice against red shirts in 2010. Currently, their intentions remain unclear. Burned by experience of recent interventions, they may want to stay on the sidelines but are unlikely to if they believe their core interests, or the integrity of the state, are in jeopardy. And, finally, the monarchy, discussion of which is circumscribed by vigorously enforced l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 laws. The elderly king&apos;s health renders unlikely his intervention in the current crisis. Most royalists loathe Thaksin and are anxious about succession. Partisan appeals for royal intervention have helped to undermine perceptions of the monarchy as above politics. Long a byword for national stability, the monarchy finds itself constrained from playing a mollifying role, on the cusp of a new era amid much uncertainty. So what&apos;s the answer to Thailand&apos;s dilemma? The opposition demands reform before elections; the government the reverse. Squaring this circle demands compromise. Protesters need to accept that the views of a majority as expressed at the ballot box cannot systematically be overturned by the minority. The government, its supporters and Thaksin need to accept that long-term stability requires that their opponents&apos; concerns be addressed. An agreement might work as follows. The democratic process should be upheld and Yingluck permitted to form a government, ideally drawn from a base broader than just her party. Recognising the country&apos;s divide, she could commit to staying in power for one year while a national dialogue takes place. Such a dialogue, which would need to be both balanced and truly reflective of all interests, could air the country&apos;s ills, whether over the rule of law, corruption, growing regionalism or even the separation of powers. Yingluck&apos;s administration should culminate in a referendum on a new constitution paving the way for fresh elections. The crown and the military could endorse such choreography. What Thailand needs are friends, domestic and international, to help it confront, not gloss over, the country&apos;s deep fissures. Seeking absolute victory, wrapped in a cloak of righteous principle, is not working. It is pushing Thailand ever closer to a precipice.

As with F1 they are complex but promise intriguing racing: the teams must now choose between running factory-spec software (the &quot;factory&quot; class \u2013 last year&apos;s prototypes) or being part of the &quot;open&quot; class, using series-supplied software. The latter will go into the season with the advantage of 24 litres of fuel instead of 20, 12 engines per season instead of five, unlimited testing and a softer tyre, and interestingly Ducati have chosen to do just that. On board, all eyes will be on Honda&apos;s Marc Marquez, who became the youngest winner of the championship in a record-breaking rookie season last year. His team-mate Dani Pedrosa is still trying for his first title after nine years with Honda, while Jorge Lorenzo has been struggling with his Yamaha in contrast to his team-mate, the old master Valentino Rossi, who has made internal team changes that suggest he is not lacking in motivation for the new season. \u2026 SPECIAL GUEST Face it, you&apos;re not going to Brazil.

But though we&apos;re poor and not as well off as the people in the capital and the central plains, we nevertheless represent a force. After all, the army no longer dares attempt a putsch because they know that we \u2013 the redshirts, who defend the government \u2013 are not afraid of tanks ...&quot; We had this conversation in the middle of February, in the yard outside a house in Na Ke, a village in the Isan region, which comprises about 20 provinces and has a separate identity from Bangkok and the rest of the country. Phokachang, and the villagers around him that evening, belong to the redshirt movement. They support former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, ousted by the military in 2006. These rural activists also back the present premier, Yingluck Shinawatra, Thaksin&apos;s sister. Elected in 2011, she has faced constant unrest since December. Her opponents aim to force her to resign, accusing her of running a corrupt regime and being manipulated by her brother, who has been in exile in Dubai since 2008 to avoid a two-year prison sentence. &quot;Thaksin is a genius,&quot; Phokachang adds. &quot;It&apos;s the first time a prime minister has ever honoured his promises to the poor.&quot; The response from the Isan farmers and their almost unquestioning support for both brother and sister are emblematic of the rift dividing the country. Thailand (population: 70 million) is split between the north and north-east on the one hand, and the south and the capital on the other; between upper and lower classes, between city and countryside. To find an explanation for the current political deadlock, we must look far from Bangkok and close to neighbouring Laos, where the benefits of the 1980s economic miracle have not reached. In Isan, with its acid earth and poor yields, modernity is often little more than a facade. Drive to remote villages and Thailand suddenly looks distinctly underdeveloped. Supot Kengam, 55, another Na Ke resident, is also effusive about Thaksin. &quot;He gave us access to medical treatment for no more than 30 bahts [less than $1] covering medical expenses or hospitalisation,&quot; she says. &quot;Before that poor people had to wait and borrow to go into hospital. Thaksin also allocated more than a million bahts [$31,000] in subsidies to each village to help development. We&apos;d never seen anything like it.&quot; The farmers do not care that Thaksin was a free-market capitalist, at the head of a government marked by corruption and nepotism. What they remember of his time in power (2001-06) are the policies which improved their standard of living. It is as if the former policeman, who made a fortune in telecommunications, gave a form of dignity to these deprived country people who had never previously dared to stand up to the traditional elites \u2013 the palace, the military and the big, well-connected corporations. Over two-thirds of government spending is allocated to Bangkok and its hinterland, whereas the north-east, home to a third of the population, receives only 6%. According to the World Bank, the income of households in Isan soared by 46% under Thaksin. A significant uplift, given that a survey by Thai researchers published in 2010 country&apos;s found a tenfold difference in wages between the top 5% and the bottom 5% in the country as a whole.     Thai redshirt supporters at a rally in Bangkok in November 2013. Photograph: Christophe Archambault/AFP    The demonstrators in Bangkok are hardline monarchists, often activists from the richest southern provinces. Backed by the middle and upper classes, they tend to look down on the farmers from the north-east, who are dismissed as &quot;water buffalo&quot;. This attitude is rooted in Isan&apos;s past. From the 13th century, much of this region was part of the kingdom of Laos. In the early 19th century, the rival kingdom of Siam \u2013 as Thailand was then known \u2013 sacked Vientiane and deported members of the Lao ethnic group to what is now north-east Thailand. They are regarded as yokels, despite being Buddhists and speaking a dialect similar to Thai. To make matters worse, the Thai authorities have tried to impose the idea of &quot;Thainess&quot;, on the grounds of national unity. Its effects may be counterproductive. &quot;Many people from this area have developed a complex sense of identity, having been rejected on ethnic grounds and sidelined socially,&quot; says American historian David Streckfuss, who lives in Isan. &quot;They now feel like second-class citizens, unable to express their culture. Meanwhile, across the border formed by the Mekong, their Lao cousins are free to behave as they wish. The redshirt movement has enabled the people of Isan to lay claim to their roots.&quot; It would a step too far to suggest that the crisis has sewn the seeds of secession, but it has widened the gap between Isan and the capital. In 2010, the redshirts occupied Bangkok to demand the return of Thaksin. The army crushed their movement, and more than 90 people died. There seems no sign of a solution. So far 22 people have been killed and 700 injured in the latest bout of unrest. Although, demonstrators have moved away from Bangkok&apos;s main crossroads and a precarious calm has been restored, everyone fears civil war as nothing has been resolved. With anti-government sentiment still running high, the redshirts in the north-eastern provinces remain on alert.

The original Asian powerhouse has not won its showpiece tournament since 1960, far too long for a country that has an unrivalled record in the World Cup and continental club competitions. That drought has not always produced the thirst it should have but there is a growing feeling in the Land of the Morning Calm that it\u2019s time. Assuming that all European-based Taeguk Warriors make it down under, Korea are a genuine contender with a young but experienced team. It features German-based strikers Son Heung-min of Bayer Leverkusen and Dortmund&apos;s Ji Dong-won, both of whom were in the squad when South Korea drew 1-1 draw four years ago and are still only 21 and 22 respectively. Sunderland midfielder Ki Sung-yeung is one of the senior players with 56 appearances but is still only 25 Like Australia, Korea have changed coach since qualifying for the World Cup, and like Australia, the team is changing its style. Hong Myong-bo likes fast counter-attacks with skilful wide players getting behind defences. At the moment however, the less said about the defence, the better. Korea is entering World Cup mode where the country is confident of a place in the last 16 but just as the Brazil draw resulted in relief, this too is seen as a good one. They are also happy at avoiding their brothers to the north, such clashes become boring on and off the pitch. ??? How they qualified: Finished third at the 2011 Asian Cup Key player: Son Heung-min Group prediction: First Oman Oman may not get the pulses racing but they will be a welcome opponent from a scouting point of view, given the four ties with Australia on the road to Brazil. Add in two meetings ahead of the 2011 Asian Cup then familiarity feeds contentment although that game in Sydney last March when the visitors played the host off the park for much of the match and was disappointed to come away with a 2-2 draw remains a warning. Paul Le Guen is still in charge and still well regarded after leading the team through impressive qualification campaigns for both World and Asian Cups. If Oman had managed to draw in Jordan in the final game on the road to Brazil, they would have entered the continental play-off for the chance to do battle with Uruguay. Most fans will be familiar with Ali Al-Habsi, one of those archetypal genial giant goalies who made a name for himself in the English Premier League with Bolton Wanderers and Wigan Athletic. The former fireman had 66,000 Bayern Munich fans howling in frustration in the UEFA Cup in 2007 as he almost single-handedly earned Bolton a famous draw. At the other end of the pitch, star striker Amad Al-Hosni has troubled Australia in the past and is increasingly surrounded by younger team-mates as Le Guen, who is approaching an impressive three year anniversary in the job, has used his joint role as Olympic coach to smoothen the transition from youth teams to senior side. Much depends on talents such as rookie striker Sami Al-Hasani helping Oman find an end product to a tidy passing game. If Le Guen can solve the scoring issue, then the group may not be quite as difficult to get out of as it looks. How they qualified: Winners of group A Key player: Ali Al Habsi. Group prediction: 3rd Kuwait Kuwait coach Jorvan Vieira has been known to wear two watches when standing on the sidelines as he did when leading Iraq to the 2007 Asian Cup title. Such information will not help him have an idea as to when or if, his contract will be terminated. At the moment, it is in place until September but that means little in west Asia where the coaching merry-go-round spins faster than Shane Warne Still, if the Brazilian, who took the job last August, is in place in January, he will face three teams that Iraq took on back in 2007 when the Lions of Mesopotamia defeated Australia and drew with Oman (in front of a few dozen fans in Bangkok) in the group stage before eliminating South Korea on penalties in the semi-final. Repeating such exploits with Kuwait is unlikely as the talent is not really there. The local league is semi-professional and in recent years has fallen far behind regional rivals such as Qatar and UAE. The national team did not exactly set qualification alight, winning only against Thailand \u2013 far short of that famous 1-0 win in Canberra during qualification to the 2011 Asian Cup. Kuwait may not be the force they were back in the seventies and eighties, when they had a tough draw at the 1982 World Cup. Games with a strong England, an excellent France and a solid Czechoslovakia team are remembered more now for the head of the Kuwaiti FA striding onto the pitch mid-game to tell the referee that a fourth French goal should be disallowed (the official obeyed). Support from the federation these days may not be quite so direct but will be substantial with funds and time provided for a serious preparation period for the Asian Cups. Friendlies are expected to be arranged against some top-notch international sides, experience that could be vital for the growing number of young players that Vieira has been introducing to the squad. How they qualified: Runners-up in group B behind Iran Key player: Yousef Nasser. Just 23 but has over 20 international goals to his name.

But some of them really were so heartbreaking. Sometimes I\u00a0got so disturbed by what I was hearing I\u00a0would hide around the corner from the tape recorder.&quot; Gillooly, 55, a director based in Boston, is explaining the peculiar process of working backwards to create her documentary Suitcase of Love and Shame. The film details the course of a long affair between a woman named Jeannie and her married lover, Tom, in the American midwest in the 1960s. Its story is told through the contents of a suitcase Gillooly bought on eBay: slides, photographs, letters and, crucially, a collection of audio tapes recorded and exchanged by the lovers themselves, which detail every aspect of their affair, from the mundane to the explicit, via mad love and despair. &quot;There was 60 hours of material,&quot; says Gillooly. &quot;Listening to the tapes the first time and not knowing what I would hear was where I had my most visceral responses. They felt so present. You actually felt it was happening in the room.&quot; Gillooly&apos;s film is one of a number that builds by exploring the history of found objects. This month sees the release of Finding Vivian Maier, the story of a Chicago nanny who was also an extraordinary street photographer, but whose pictures remained unseen in her lifetime. Maier died in 2009, two years after author and historian John Maloof found a box of her negatives at auction while researching a book on Chicago history and began tracking down both the woman and her photographs. Maier took some 100,000 pictures on her Rolleiflex camera, mostly undeveloped, and largely of everyday life in Chicago \u2013 maids on street corners, the scruffier corners of the city&apos;s Polish quarter, a young man riding on horseback through the middle of the road, but also of trips to places such as Bangkok and Italy and Egypt. They have since been exhibited around the world and published in a collection, but Maloof&apos;s film looks behind the images to try to find Maier herself, tracing the course of her life, from New York to France and back to the US, as well as finding the children she cared for.     One of Vivian Maier's street photographs. Photograph:    Vivian Maier/Maloof Collection    A few years ago, Jason Bitner, one of the creators of Found magazine, also stumbled upon a stash of photographs: 18,000 formal portraits taken over the course of three decades by Indiana photographer Frank Pease at christenings, graduations, marriages and family gatherings. Bitner turned the collection into a book that would later become a documentary, revisiting some of the Pease&apos;s subjects \u2013 now adults and aged, divorced, humbled by life&apos;s turns. Not dissimilar is Simon Aeppli&apos;s 2011 short film Come In and See the Bed, which followed the year after his father&apos;s death, in which his mother&apos;s neighbour began leaving peculiar notes in the privet hedge between their two bungalows, accusing her of conducting an affair with her middle-aged son: an unsettling stack of warnings scrawled on fragments of envelopes and slips of old paper. &quot;I get no sleep at night time,&quot; many of them begin. &quot;Stay in own house at night \u2026&quot; insist others. For Gillooly, there was less of an element of chance in finding her subject matter. She was looking to make a film about time \u2013 inspired, she explains, by finding a collection of all her old birth control. &quot;It was fascinating unpacking this box,&quot; she says. &quot;They really did tell a story about sexual politics in a certain period. And I thought this would be an interesting way to build a film.&quot; One of her earlier works was a piece made for US public television in the 1990s, inspired by a photo of a dead woman, naked on a hotel-room floor, after an attempted illegal abortion in 1964.&quot;It&apos;s an horrific image that a lot of people in the US have seen. I took this very famous photograph and then I researched it and recreated the events that led up to the moment the photograph was taken.&quot; In that film, Leona&apos;s Sister Gerri, Gillooly examines the contents of the dead woman&apos;s handbag, piecing together her story from the letters and photographs it contains to discover that the woman had sought the abortion because she was pregnant by a married man. &quot;She was ashamed,&quot; Gillooly says. &quot;People wanted to know why I was making a film about abortion. And I used to say to them that to me this wasn&apos;t a film about abortion, this was a film about shame.&quot; When she came to research Suitcase of Love and Shame, she was therefore already familiar with the sexual politics of the era. &quot;It was the same time, the same moral codes,&quot; she explains. &quot;Birth control was still illegal [in some states] in the United States in 1964. A time when people&apos;s sexual lives were so inhibited.&quot; Gillooly took a painstaking approach to her subject \u2013 first acquainting herself with the technology of two-track tapes before digitalising each of the recordings, and then researching who Tom and Jeannie were, the towns they lived in, the places they would meet in secret. &quot;There was a lot of other information in the suitcase that I didn&apos;t share with the viewer, because I wanted to keep it mysterious,&quot; Gillooly says. &quot;But I could track down addresses they were at in the early 1960s. I do know where both their houses were, so I was able to go and do some shooting in the area where they lived. I did layer in some sound from the midwest, and there&apos;s a scene in the hotel, where there&apos;s a revolving door and you hear the elevator ring \u2026 that was the actual hotel where that tape was made.&quot; It made, she recalls, for a particularly intense recording experience. &quot;Very little had changed at the location. Even the elevator hadn&apos;t been changed. And there is a shot in the film looking out of the hotel-room window, and that was the scene they would&apos;ve seen.&quot; It is not important, she feels, for the audience to know that this is the actual location. &quot;But I do,&quot; she says. &quot;That&apos;s important to me when I work; I need the back story in order to shape my films.&quot; Initially, she had intended the film to be an audio piece, inspired by Derek Jarman&apos;s Blue. &quot;My first cut didn&apos;t have any pictures at all,&quot; she says. &quot;My first cut was going to be where you would come in, and you&apos;d sit down and you&apos;d listen.&quot; But gradually she began to add images \u2013 abstracts that grew into more concrete depictions but still remain open to interpretation. &quot;The film itself is unique in that you&apos;re staring at a screen but you&apos;re not really watching a movie,&quot; Gillooly says. &quot;A lot of what you&apos;re seeing is in your own imagination. And you&apos;re being prompted to imagine certain kinds of things.&quot; It was with this in mind that Gillooly chose not to include or recreate any of the more explicit scenes, judging that the audience&apos;s imagination would be more powerful. &quot;I have the pictures they took of each other. But I think the parts that people find erotic are different depending on who the listener is, and I think that this is fascinating.&quot; However, the first scene she shot was a group of red trees used to illustrate a scene in which Jeannie orgasms. &quot;There&apos;s a certain kind of tree that grows here called a burning bush,&quot; Gillooly laughs. &quot;They&apos;re gorgeous and they have that crazy reddish pink in the fall. I knew I wanted something that was just going to be really abstract. So I decided I wanted to shoot these trees, bringing them into focus when she orgasms. And it&apos;s kind of hokey and obvious in a way, but I think it worked.&quot;     Jane Gillooly: 'Sometimes I got so disturbed I'd hide around the corner from the tape recorder.'    The explicitness of some of the recordings is of course notable, but Gillooly says she was equally fascinated by other elements of the story \u2013 the intricate descriptions of sex, for instance, also offer insights into the era. &quot;It wasn&apos;t so much shocking that they were talking about it,&quot; she says, &quot;but what was surprising was that they seemed to be really uneducated about sex. Not entirely. Maybe they didn&apos;t have a word for female ejaculation then.&quot; Similarly, the behaviour of Tom&apos;s wife, diligently tracking the couple down to hotels &quot;very really could have been because there really were these morals laws in the US, where if you couldn&apos;t prove that your husband had done something against the moral code then it would be very hard for you in court to argue in your defence: I&apos;m sure she was very worried about being financially ruined if he left them.&quot; The film&apos;s most affecting parts come in the couple&apos;s construction of the day-to-day intimacy an affair cannot grant: Jeannie recording the sounds of dogs barking as she showers; Tom, a doctor, reading through the entries in his diary, full of 10am meetings and afternoon appointments, delivering anecdotes about making lamp-bases, or describing every single object on his office desk. It is the sound of a man falling in love with himself, in some ways, but also supplying his lover with the sustenance to keep their affair going. &quot;And I think that&apos;s why Jeannie was the one who really wanted these tapes,&quot; Gillooly says. &quot;Because it gave her some sense of a family.&quot; It was Jeannie, she explains, who was the motivator in making these recordings. &quot;Jeannie was the one who would get the hotel room and lug the tape recorder \u2013 and those tape recorders were heavy. She would bring a record player, she would bring food, she would make sure the tape recorder was actually running when he knocked on the door so that she would get the moment of them greeting each other.&quot; These happy scenes, the creation of a brief kind of normality, near-domesticity, are almost as heartbreaking as the more pained conversations. &quot;But I think one of the worst is the tape of Jeannie where she is just so anguished and crying,&quot; says Gillooly. &quot;That tape has been so highly edited and so compressed, but it was a really long recording. She recorded it at a slower speed and so it was more like 40 minutes long. Certainly you hear her break down and cry, but there was a lot more to it \u2013 how she felt about this desperate situation they were in.&quot; Meanwhile, she says, &quot;Tom could be quite pathetic. It was almost as if he wasn&apos;t listening to himself. He&apos;d be contradicting himself all in the same tape. There&apos;s a tape where he says: &apos;I can&apos;t go on, I can&apos;t, I can&apos;t, I just can&apos;t do it, I can&apos;t do it&apos; \u2013 many tapes like that where he has those frightful sad moments. And then two weeks later it&apos;s as if he doesn&apos;t even remember.&quot; Tom never left his wife, though the affair ran for many years. In the course of her research, Gillooly even tracked down Jeannie, who was living in a nursing home, but able to tell her enough to make Gillooly appreciate the circumstances of the affair, suffering from dementia. &quot;She treated me as if I were in her parlour, making me feel comfortable and welcome,&quot; Gillooly remembers. &quot;Though she didn&apos;t care who I was \u2013 she barely let me talk actually, I was just prompting some happy memories for her, for the most part. She was very personable, very sweet, very chatty, the way she is on the tapes, and though her voice is quite different, a very elderly-sounding voice, there were some phrases, a few words, that she had used on the tape. But the conversations were circular, they didn&apos;t necessarily make sense.&quot; She asked about Tom, and was surprised to find that when Jeannie spoke &quot;he was this professional man that she admired \u2026 she didn&apos;t talk about him romantically at all. When I asked about being in love, she would talk about her first husband.&quot; Jeannie, Gillooly discovered, was widowed young, her first husband killed in the war. &quot;It did really make me understand so much more about her. That she really was trying to replace him.&quot;It is hard not to wonder how the experience of making this film affected Gillooly, whether it changed how she herself viewed relationships, the needs and desires of others, but she insists not. &quot;There wasn&apos;t anything surprising in this at all to me,&quot; she says. &quot;You can&apos;t help but compare it to what&apos;s happening now \u2014 to how people are exchanging these private moments today. But where it differs radically is that this couple were inventing the form. The significance of this material is really that it was so new \u2013 the technology was so new and what they were doing with it was unique. It was that time-capsule thing that fascinates me so much. We all think that we have witnessed reality shows in a way, but what&apos;s so startling about these tapes is they really do feel real. This is what&apos;s so astounding about it. It&apos;s so real, and it&apos;s so raw.&quot; \u2022 Suitcases of Love and Shame is at The Art of the Real film festival in New York in April.

Last August their two-bedroom flat in Manila was flooded when severe tropical storm Trami dumped 15 inches of rain (380mm) in a few hours and the local reservoir overflowed. They fled to a flyover with thousands of others as five large areas of the capital were inundated with muddy waters up to three metres deep and a state of calamity was declared in three Philippine provinces. In 2012, typhoon Haikui battered the megacity of 12 million people for eight days, but when tropical storm Ondoy hit Manila in 2009 and a month&apos;s worth of rain fell in a few hours, the city came close to catastrophe. Nearly 80% was flooded, 246 people died and hundreds of thousands had to be evacuated. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN&apos;s climate science panel, life in the world&apos;s coastal cities is about to get much worse as temperatures rise a further 4C over the century. Manila, Guangzhou, Lagos, Ho Chi Minh City, Kolkata, Shanghai, Mumbai, Tianjin, Rangoon, Bangkok and 100 others in high-risk tropical and subtropical regions are most vulnerable. They can expect to be swamped more often by tidal surges, battered by ever stronger typhoons and storms, and hit by deeper droughts. Not only will food in cities become more expensive as crops are hit by weather extremes, but cities such as Manila can expect more power shortages, disease and interruption of water supply; nights will become hotter and they will have fewer cool days. Add to that the pollution cloud that already hangs over most Asian cities, and urban life may become unhealthy, unpalatable and more unpredictable, the report suggests. &quot;Heat stress, extreme precipitation, inland and coastal flooding, as well as drought and water scarcity pose risks in urban areas, with risks amplified for those lacking essential infrastructure and services or living in exposed areas,&quot; says the report, which makes this forecast with &quot;very high confidence&quot;.     Flooded areas in Marikina, east of Manila, Philippines.   Photograph: Philippines Department Of National Defense/AP    As the Philippines recovers from the estimated $36bn (\u00a322bn) of damage caused last November by super-typhoon Haiyan (known locally as Yolanda) \u2013 the most powerful storm ever to have made landfall \u2013 the state meteorological office, Pagasa, says that climate change is already hitting the country hard. &quot;There has been a significant increase [in the last 30 years] in the number of hot days and warm nights and a decreasing trend in the number of cold days and cold nights. Both maximum and minimum temperatures are getting warmer. Extreme rainfall events are becoming more frequent. In most parts \u2026 the intensity of rainfall is increasing. The number of cyclones is less than it was, but they are getting stronger,&quot; said a Pagasa spokesman. &quot;We had a foretaste with Yolanda. No one had experienced winds of 300 kilometres per hour before. The whole city of Tacloban was destroyed. Now we know we can expect more aggressive Yolandas coming our way,&quot; said Alicia Ilaga, head of climate change in the government&apos;s agriculture department. &quot;We had never seen anything like Yolanda before, but we see typhoons coming to areas where they were never experienced before. It&apos;s an early warning. It has taken a disaster like that for people to realise that these extremes are not natural. If we are hit by extremes every year we will go back to square one,&quot; she said. &quot;Every city and every sector of our country and society is at risk,&quot; said Yeb Sano, the Philippine government&apos;s climate change commissioner. &quot;The IPCC tells us it will probably get 4C warmer. That means everything will be compromised, from food and energy to settlements. We are not ready. The challenge is too huge. I cannot imagine what would happen if a typhoon the strength of Yolanda hit Manila or the second city, Cebu. It would be a global disaster. It will take us 20 years to recover from Yolanda as it is. We lost 1m homes then. We are very vulnerable.&quot;     A group of Filipino farm workers huddle beneath a bridge to seek shelter from rains and rising floodwaters. Photograph: Jay Directo/AFP/Getty Images    The government is urgently drawing up detailed maps of all vulnerable areas, but says that the money is just not there to protect 100 million people living in both cities and rural areas. &quot;Rich countries tell us to become climate resilient. We agree, but who pays? We have received possibly $5m, from the World Bank for studies to adapt to climate change, and that is all,&quot; said Ilaga. Dennis Posadas, Manila-based fellow of the Climate Institute in Washington and Philippine technology consultant, said climate change would bring ill-health and water rationing to cities such as Manila and Cebu, along with more intestinal and mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis and chikungunya fever. &quot;If temperatures go up 3-4C as the IPCC expects, then evaporation will be greater in reservoirs, which will mean less water, and diseases like dengue will increase. Mosquitoes will breed more easily. People will get heatstroke.&quot; Manila, he says, is already several degrees warmer than surrounding areas in the day and is stifling at night because of the urban heat-island effect, which releases the heat stored in concrete, roads and buildings at night. &quot;A 4C rise in temperature will make life unbearable and air conditioning an absolute necessity,&quot; he said.     Edna Mendoza stands with her daughter at the door of their home as they clean up the mud and debris from the floods   in Manila, Philippines. Photograph: Paula Bronstein/Getty Images    Posadas, who has moved his family out of the city for health reasons, says climate change will hit the poorest hardest. &quot;Tens of thousands of people in Manila live in shanty towns that are in the way of the floods. These people will be the most vulnerable. What the IPCC report means is that those areas that are not already flooded when it rains heavily will be in future. Everything will become more extreme. Subsidence will be exacerbated, high temperatures will become unbearable. These days 32C (90F) is common and lots of people still do not have fridges \u2013 so food will go off. Climate change will slow down economic growth, further erode food security, trigger new poverty traps and create hotspots of hunger.&quot; Dante Dalabajan, Oxfam&apos;s programme co-ordinator in Mindanao, who worked on the Yolanda emergency, said: &quot;The danger is that Filipinos will be trapped in a vicious cycle where the more the planet heats up the more they adopt the technologies they think will help, but will actually exacerbate the problems. The potential for epidemics in cities is huge. You cannot just evacuate millions of people.&quot; Alvarez said: &quot;We expect catastrophe now. But what can we do? We don&apos;t need the scientists to tell us any more that we are vulnerable. We just need help. We can see what is happening.

The hero of your new novel, the shadowy Lord Doyle, is addicted to baccarat. What is it about gambling that speaks to you as a writer? I&apos;m not a gambler. But I went to Vegas a bit when I was living in California 20 years ago and always found the place strangely human, intense. Later, living in Bangkok, I used to go to Macau for my monthly visa run, and became addicted to the city itself. I still love it, though it is going the wrong way with all the oversized casinos being imposed on it. There is a fragile melancholy about the place. I immediately felt the Chinese casinos were far more interesting than the Vegas ones. I was struck by the atmosphere of the supernatural that hung over them. Living in this part of the world you get used to that feeling: the absolute belief in ghosts, in luck. The dead are always near. Around my apartment there are dozens of spirit-houses that are lit through the night: you feel them. It&apos;s that idea of the dead exerting power over the living that fascinated me, and of course the idea of karma, or fate. I dare say this theme is the principal one in my novels, however imperfectly I understand that complex Buddhist idea. Do you believe in luck? It&apos;s often discounted in modern British life, especially by those politicians who believe in &quot;hard work&quot;. I&apos;ll wager there isn&apos;t a human being on earth who doesn&apos;t believe in luck, however rational they pretend to be in public life. In reality, most of human life is luck \u2013 and of course its darker, more prevalent opposite. One only has to live long enough to experience both. Your hero becomes an odd celebrity when he has a winning streak. Is this a metaphor for our times, people becoming famous seemingly on the turn of a coin? I&apos;ve spent most of my adult life in the United States, and there the celebrity culture has been entrenched for a long time. It has made people almost literally insane, even those who make a great show of repudiating it. Those people, like novelists, who can no longer enjoy this status are condemned to despise it. As for gamblers, I don&apos;t know why they aren&apos;t yet celebrities. I think it&apos;s a residual moral distaste in the case of the United States, but in China it&apos;s surely just around the corner. There&apos;s a distinct shift in the tone of the novel part way through, moving from dirty realism to something altogether more ethereal. Would you be able to say something about that? The supernatural element in the story was always what I set out to do originally. But put the words &quot;ghost story&quot; in front of most English speakers and you&apos;re immediately kicked into the Stephen King category. I took my cue more from contemporary Asian film than from the western idea of the supernatural, which is usually gory, unconvincing and dated because we no longer believe in those things. Here in Asia, film-makers like Kiyoshi Kurosawa and Hideo Nakata have created subtle and chilling psychological explorations using the supernatural as their lever. These are narratives in which in which very little happens, in which the dead are present in a partially invisible way. Think, too, of such classics of Japanese film as Ugetsu and Kwaidan \u2013 among the most beautiful and tragic films ever made. Your last novel, The Forgiven, is set in Morocco, at a decadent party held by westerners and in a desert village where people make their living from fossils. How did the idea come to you? I had lived in Morocco, travelling across it by myself. One winter I went to Erfoud to research trilobites and got to know the quarries, the dealers and the remote mining villages. They are not easy places to visit, and this was a completely unknown corner of the world economy, children slaving away on desert cliffs to furnish wealthy collectors in San Francisco. I resolved not to moralise about it, but simply to show it as it is. Or as I saw it. It has been compared to Paul Bowles&apos;s The Sheltering Sky. Where would you place it? Firstly, there is the western literature of colonial north Africa. I read Gide&apos;s The Immoralist over and over as a teenager. I was obsessed with it. It&apos;s written with such simplicity and dread, and the desert, the shabby colonial world, is brought right into your consciousness without being over-explained. Gide understood that a white writer cannot go in and talk as if he knows the place; he can only make something out of his incomprehension. It&apos;s as honourable or dishonourable as that. Bowles was greatly influenced by Gide. That tradition died with the colonial world. Think, too, Tropic Moon by Simenon \u2013 a writer I adore. In some ways it&apos;s a French tradition. Secondly, there&apos;s the wider tradition to which Bowles belongs. In his stories, I see not only the obvious lineage of Poe but of the Romantic fabulists like Kleist and Hoffmann. But if it was ever a literary tradition, it&apos;s gone dead now. Bowles had no American heirs. He was too exotic. He didn&apos;t even live in the States \u2013 gasp! For years living in New York myself I never encountered any admirers of his who were actually novelists. The American novel went elsewhere. And yet he&apos;s one of the greatest American writers. The Spider&apos;s House should have been compulsory reading after 9/11. It took a long time to find a publisher for The Forgiven. Why? Mostly, just that I was an outsider to the fiction world. Indeed, my American agent at the time urged me not to bother at all. In the end, I sent it myself to an editor I didn&apos;t know late on a Friday night after a bottle of good but despair-ridden and lonely Chablis. A push of a button. The manuscript had been rejected by dozens of houses, even by editors I&apos;d published books with. This was a last-chance gamble. He took it with him on the train home to New Jersey that night and somewhere in the darkened satanic mills of Newark or wherever he sent me a message saying that he was 30 pages in and that was enough. He offered for the book on Monday morning. It&apos;s a terrifying novel about guilt. In the world you create, it seems not to exist. Yes. Guilt is the most mysterious of emotions. What intuition does it spring from? I was baptised a Catholic and always wondered what influence that has had on my feeling about it. That said, the guilt explored by Graham Greene has always felt slightly theatrical to me \u2013 and Greene is an immensely important writer for me. Is it possible for a writer to not quite believe in his own most identifiable theme? You wrote your first novel in 1986, and then made a career as a travel writer and journalist. Did the novel leave you, or did you leave the novel? It&apos;s a question that has no rational answer. In the first place I had to make a living without any means, without any support, and journalism was the only way to do it. For a while, I enjoyed journalism too, though it&apos;s a young man&apos;s game. I enjoyed walking across Papua or living with deaf children in Nicaragua. That sort of thing. Maybe I should have remembered Cyril Connolly&apos;s words of warning about journalism [Connolly warned: literature is the art of something that will be read twice; journalism what will be read once]. On the other, I had something I felt I had to say in that form. The novel is an immensely difficult form. For years I wrote novels that I could not realise in a way that meant anything to me. I didn&apos;t want to climb up the literary-industrial complex, grinding out good-bad novels. Journalism seemed more honourable. Why waste a reader&apos;s time? So I failed to publish a second one for 27 years. The ones I did weren&apos;t good enough. What I cherish in writers I admire is their authority. They know what they feel and think and they have found a sure and measured way to say it exactly. They have mastered not just language \u2013 because, surprisingly, many people master that in their way \u2013 but the equally great moral enigmas of structure and plot and tone. Again, this is curiously more obvious in film where story itself must resonate and penetrate the viewer. A film-maker&apos;s style will not carry the day by itself. Many writers will vehemently disagree with this. But to each his own. These things, in any case, are not conscious. In the end, we don&apos;t know why we tell certain stories and why they carry us along with them. Is it surprising to have returned to it? Novels are supposedly the province of the young\u2026 We live in a hysterical youth culture, for sure. It&apos;s ironic, given that most western societies are in fact anything but youthful. There&apos;s therefore something sinister and forced about it. As I found, the late starter is never forgiven or even tolerated. It&apos;s a curious hostility, but there&apos;s nothing to be done about it. You blossom when you blossom \u2013 or not at all. Your biography is mysterious. What did you do before you were a writer? I&apos;ve seen you described as &quot;itinerant&quot;. I have a strong nomadic tendency. I spent years in menial jobs, barely surviving in New York when I first moved to the US. One year I got a job as a small-town reporter on the Mexican border, in San Diego and Tijuana. It was a completely anonymous life, exploring migrant workers and eventually covering Mexico itself. I used to ride the illegal immigrants&apos; buses from Mexico City to Sonoyta on the border. I saw how brutal and desperate the underbelly of even a wealthy country is, and I dare say the seeds of The Forgiven were probably sown on those agonising bus rides through the desert. I think, in retrospect, I just wanted to knock around the world for a while and see it from the bottom up. Immensely interesting, but not a career. I didn&apos;t want it to be. An obsession with career had always struck me as mildly psychotic. Eventually I began writing for the New York Times, and started coming through Bangkok on a regular basis. There are places one loves at first sight. It&apos;s the only great city apart from Beijing that was never part of a European colony. I could sense that underneath the western veneer it was a profoundly enigmatic, truly Asian city. It was chaotic, unbearable, immense, corrupt, yet shot through with a distinct grace and subtlety. The polychrome Hindu gods on the street corners were the sign that it was not a simple or intolerant place. It&apos;s a perfect city for a writer. In 2012 I moved here more permanently. I live in a quiet and jungly neighbourhood which is more like a village, and look out over skyscrapers and neon in the distance. A great city leaves you alone, offers you tranquillity and privacy and ease. Granted, it&apos;s not how most foreigners live here. For me, it&apos;s a way to be alone and be close to certain things in myself. It&apos;s a great city in which to be alone because Thai life is decidedly un-lonely. The intense street life, for one thing, ensures that you are not, in fact, alone at all. You can merge into a sea of humanity in five minutes. Friendly and relaxed humanity, at that. These new mega-cities in Asia are extremely interesting \u2013 this is where the 21st century will be played out. They are an entirely new form of city. Very few writers live here, of course. But that&apos;s quite all right with me. How will the acclaim now coming your way affect what you do next?  I don&apos;t notice it much. Thais don&apos;t really care about books, and this is oddly liberating. Moreover, you get to a point in your life where it&apos;s much less important than it used to be. The next one is a novel set in Cambodia called Hunters in the Dark.

An opponent of Colonel Gaddafi who was rendered in a joint MI6-CIA operation, and a leading human rights group representing him, have demanded that the foreign secretary, William Hague, clarify the UK&apos;s position on Diego Garcia, an atoll in the Indian Ocean leased to the US until 2016. The Senate&apos;s intelligence security committee is preparing to declassify a file that reportedly confirms that the CIA detained &quot;high-value suspects on Diego Garcia&quot; and that &quot;the black site arrangement on the atoll was made with the &apos;full cooperation&apos; of the British government&quot;. The revelations are hugely troubling for the government and threaten to raise awkward questions about the UK&apos;s relationship with the US, its closest security ally. They strengthen claims made by Abdel-Hakim Belhaj, a rebel military commander and opponent of Gaddafi, who was arrested in Malaysia and rendered with his pregnant wife to Libya, allegedly via Diego Garcia, in a joint US-UK intelligence operation. Papers discovered in Tripoli in 2011 show that the British security services were instrumental in helping Libya to seize Belhaj, who says he was tortured during his rendition and during his subsequent four-and-a-half-year incarceration by the Gaddafi regime. A flight plan confirmed the CIA had intended to render him via Diego Garcia. Belhaj, who unsuccessfully tried to bring a case against former foreign secretary Jack Straw, former senior MI6 official Sir Mark Allen, the security services and the Foreign Office, told the Observer that the Senate report raised new questions about the role played by the British overseas territory in facilitating the CIA&apos;s extraordinary rendition programme. &quot;The first time I heard that I had gone through a place called Diego Garcia was when I was told by the head of the Libyan intelligence, Moussa Koussa, during my first interrogation session in a prison outside Tripoli,&quot; Belhaj said. &quot;He was running the interrogation and was angry that it had taken a long time for me to arrive in Libya. I told him that the plane had stopped somewhere on the way from Bangkok. He told me that he knew, and that the plane had landed on an island in the Indian Ocean called Diego Garcia. &quot;Perhaps he was showing off, or perhaps he had been given wrong information, I don&apos;t know. I just know that the flight stopped somewhere. I was chained up in a very painful position and had no means to know where I was, or even whether my pregnant wife \u2013 who had been kidnapped at the same time \u2013 was with me.&quot; Although the British government admitted in 2008 that two rendition flights carrying detainees had stopped for refuelling on Diego Garcia in 2002, it has consistently denied that detainees were held on it. &quot;Each year the US government reaffirms to us during our official political-military discussions that all previous assurances since 2008 on this subject remain correct,&quot; Mark Simmonds, the minister for overseas territories, wrote in a letter last month to Richard Ottaway, the chairman of parliament&apos;s foreign affairs select committee. &quot;Namely that, apart from two instances in Diego Garcia during 2002, there have been no other instances in which US intelligence flights landed in the United Kingdom, UK overseas territories or crown dependencies, with a detainee on board since 11 September 2001.&quot; Polly Rossdale, deputy director at human rights group Reprieve, which has acted for Belhaj, said: &quot;The government must come clean about the UK&apos;s role in this dirty affair.&quot; A spokesman for the Foreign Office declined to add any comment to what ministers had already told parliament.", "publicationDate": "2014-04-12T23:06:12Z", "tags": ["Chagos Islands", "Rendition", "CIA", "World news", "Libya", "US news", "UK news", "Jack Straw", "Politics"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/13/cia-black-site-diego-garcia-uk-role", "title": "UK urged to admit that CIA used island as secret 'black site' prison", "sentences": ["I told him that the plane had stopped somewhere on the way from Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Janetira Thai, 28 Brewer Street, London W1(020 7434 3777). No booking. Meal for two \u00a360 The night before I visited Janetira Thai for lunch I washed my hair. This is a big job. It requires an official notice to the water company and an amber alert from the Met Office. Still, I thought it necessary. If everything I\u00a0had read was correct, I was going to be eating a dish of such uncommon chilli heat and power that my body was likely to deliver an involuntary response, far beyond the hiccups and pain most people associate with a\u00a0major dose of capsaicin. Many people sweat in response to eating chillies; few make like they&apos;ve just been hosed down by the London fire brigade. Even if my tongue hasn&apos;t registered the heat my body will. The sweat flows from a well spring somewhere in the depths of my scalp, courses down the heavy geography of my face, pooling in the bags beneath my eyes, before spilling over on to my shirt. I reckoned it was worth starting that experience with clean hair. What&apos;s that? You&apos;re trying to eat while reading this? I do apologise. I had heard mutterings about this particular dish online for a while. Then it was reviewed in a newspaper you do not and never will read, but whose critic has been known to follow my lead; I decided to return the compliment. It&apos;s not uncommon for a single dish to make an impact like this. People assume any buzz will always be around a whole restaurant, but it&apos;s not necessarily so. Sometimes it&apos;s the chilli crab at one place, or the whole roast chicken at another or the lasagne cooked to some porcini-heavy 14th-century recipe that you just have to try, because if you don&apos;t try it you are missing out. You are less than a complete person. I hate being less than complete. This me-too adventurism is both tragic and encouraging: tragic, because there is little sadder than doing something because you don&apos;t want to be left out; encouraging because what is life, if not a set of experiences accumulated?     The super-hot mackerel curry. Photograph: Antonio Olmos for the Observer    Whether the mackerel curry at Janetira in London&apos;s Soho is an experience you will wish to accumulate will be a judgement call. I&apos;m glad I&apos;ve done it. In the way of this particular dish I suspect I will be compelled to do it again, even though to the western palate it is more wrongness than you could find in the locked bottom drawer of a\u00a0Tory MP&apos;s filing cabinet. They make much of its heat. It is listed not just on the menu in the simple dining room, a\u00a0vaguely gloomy modernist space of blocky dark wood tables, but also on a\u00a0blackboard, where is written: &quot;Super Duper Spicy \u2013 we dare you.&quot; There are four chilli pictograms by it. You get the idea. Curiously, heat is not really the issue. That&apos;s a tiresomely macho sideshow. What matters is the flavour which is achieved \u2013 and there&apos;s no polite way to say this \u2013 through the use of fermented fish guts. Of course, fermented fish matter in the form of fish sauce, or nam pla, is a staple of Thai cooking. But this is something else, so very much deeper and darker. The curry arrives at the tables a\u00a0scary, rotten, vegetal brown, with the only hope lying in a couple of green beans bobbing on the surface. I\u00a0stick my face into it and inhale. The thing honks. It is the profane realised in calories, an invitation to depravity. There is a\u00a0kick of the Marseilles docks, with a heavy back note of Peckham drain and yet something else altogether more savoury and enticing.     Duck noodle soup. Photograph: Antonio Olmos for the Observer    The key to the dish is not how it smells, but how it tastes. Yes, there is heat. Eventually my diaphragm will indeed go into spasm and my hair will become damp and matted. But before that there is an overt, fishy savouriness; layer upon layer of umami which makes it irresistible. It is a deep well of flavour into which I\u00a0cannot resist falling. I know it will repeat on me for days, that it will be inescapable. And even though, after a few spoonfuls, I\u00a0move on to try something else, it is a dish I cannot help returning to. It cannot be denied. I\u00a0need another hit. I&apos;m glad I\u00a0came. There is a brighter, fresher edge of this overt fishiness in a green papaya salad with pickled tiny crabs called som tum poo (oh stop sniggering at the back there). Other things are far less challenging. Their moo ping, pieces of pork marinated in coconut milk and lemon grass and then chargrilled, are dark and smoky. They bring the flavour of the street indoors. More subtle are son-in-law balls, which have to be ordered by dint of name alone: halves of egg boiled until the yolk is only just set, then deep fried in a little batter and topped with crisp shallots and a tamarind sauce. It starts as a textural thing, before slapping you about the chops with a\u00a0hit of sweet and sour. Ka nah crispy pork brings thumbnail-sized pieces of deep-fried belly, hinged between soft fat and splintering meat, with lots of invigorating greens and fresh red chillies. Most soothing of all is their duck noodle soup. The soft slices of long-braised duck are great, as are the extra thin egg noodles with just a\u00a0hint of bite. But it&apos;s the liquorice-dark broth with its hit of five spice that really makes its mark. It&apos;s what pho wants to be when it grows up. After the carefully choreographed violence of the mackerel curry I regard this broth as a place of safety. Most of the main dishes cost between \u00a38 and \u00a39, with a couple in the low teens. For the sake of doubt this is a\u00a0positive review. Janetira serves brilliant Thai food. It&apos;s just not the Thai food most people are used to. It does not make its point through lashings of sugar. It embraces pungency and depth. Some people may run from it; I ran towards it, my clean hair trailing in the wind behind me. Dessert starts and finishes at ice lollies, so instead we wandered round the corner to Spuntino and pulled up a stool at the counter for its brown sugar cheesecake and its peanut butter and jelly sandwich, made with an iced peanut butter parfait cut into white bread squares. That, and a big hit of properly made espresso, and the world settled at last on its axis. By the end of lunch my hair was dry once more. We were done. Jay&apos;s news bites \u25a0 The repertoire at Kaosarn in the covered arcade known as Brixton Village may not be quite as challenging as that at Janetira Thai, but the food is head and shoulders above much of what&apos;s available in Britain.

Most North Koreans only have access to a state controlled intranet, called Kwangmyong, or bright.  The country does have its own twitter account @uriminzok (english translation available @uriminzok_engl), launched in 2010 declaring &quot;The Web site &apos;Our Nation&apos; is on Twitter&quot;. At the time of writing the account follows three others: Vietnam, a Pyongyang propaganda site and Jimmy Dushku, a 25-year-old web developer and tycoon from Texas who is as confused as the rest of us as to why.  In 2013 they opened up a 3G network, but only for foreign tourists. Associated Press journalist Jean H Lee (@newsjean) was the first person to Tweet and Instagram from it, closely followed by Dennis Rodman. Lee described the experience as liberating, moving on from the days where she had to leave her phone at the airport.     My first tweet using #Koryolink&#39;s new mobile #Internet service.

David Guttenfelder, a photographer for Associated Press who, like Lee, enjoys more access than most, has to ask permission in writing everywhere he goes: &quot;There are some very difficult discussions after the pictures are published - we often lock horns because they have a very different idea of how North Korea should be covered,&quot; he says. Guttenfelder, who won a Time award for his Instagram coverage, believes the secret to covering North Korea is in the mundane detail, &quot;the piece off the puzzle that when you put them all together reveal something about the place&quot;.

Absolutely beautiful prose. I can only imagine what it reads like in the original Spanish. Finally, a book I bang on about all the time - John Irving&apos;s astonishing A Prayer for Owen Meany.

Researchers say jackfruit \u2013 a large ungainly fruit grown across south and south-east Asia \u2013 could be a replacement for wheat, corn and other staple crops under threat from climate change. The World Bank and United Nations warned recently that rising temperatures and unpredictable rainfall had already reduced yields of wheat and corn, and could lead to food wars within the decade. Now researchers say jackfruit could help provide the solution. Jackfruit is the largest known treeborne fruit. Even a small jackfruit weighs in at 10-15lbs (5-7kg), and farmers have recorded specimens of more than 100lbs (45kg). &quot;It&apos;s a miracle. It can provide so many nutrients and calories \u2013 everything,&quot; said Shyamala Reddy, a biotechnology researcher at the University of Agriculture Sciences in Bangalore, India. &quot;If you just eat 10 or 12 bulbs of this fruit, you don&apos;t need food for another half a day.&quot;     Jackfruit is sold on a Bangkok street, Thailand. Photograph: Bertrand Gardel/Alamy    But jackfruit, despite its huge potential, remains underexploited as a food crop in India, where it originated. That is beginning to change, however, with a growing number of researchers looking for alternatives. Reddy&apos;s university will host an international conference on jackfruit in May. She said the Indian government had launched a number of new initiatives to promote the crop by expanding its use as a canned vegetable and as a processed food. The effort coincides with a global push to expand food production, especially in developing countries which are expected to face growing challenges to feed their people in the coming decades.     Jackfruit is the largest known treeborne fruit. Photograph: Stefano Paterna/Alamy    Jackfruit can fill the gap on a number of counts, said Danielle Nierenberg, president of Food Tank, which works on sustainable agriculture. &quot;It is easy to grow. It survives pests and diseases and high temperatures. It is drought-resistant,&quot; she said. &quot;It achieves what farmers need in food production when facing a lot of challenges under climate change.&quot; The fruit is rich in potassium, calcium, and iron, said Reddy, making it more nutritious than current starchy staples. Sri Lanka and Vietnam have established jackfruit industries, where the fruit is processed into products as diverse as flour, noodles, papad and ice cream. Jackfruit is also canned and sold as a vegetable for export. But jackfruit remains a hard sell in much of India. Although the fruit was seen as an important staple 40 or 50 years ago, it is now derided as a poor man&apos;s fruit, said Shree Padre, a jackfruit farmer from Karnataka. Only one or two commercial-scale jackfruit plantations are in current operation. &quot;In the country of origin, it is just not understood,&quot; he said. &quot;There is an inferiority attached to jackfruit. Any farmer would happily carry an imported apple in his hand rather than jackfruit.&quot; The down-market reputation is unwarranted, said Nyree Zerega, a researcher on plant biology at the Chicago Botanic Garden, who has studied jackfruit in Bangladesh. In addition to its high nutritional value, the fruit is very versatile, she said. The seeds, young fruit, and mature varieties are all edible. The timber from jackfruit trees is also valuable. &quot;It is just not being utilised,&quot; she said. &quot;I think it could play a much more important role in diets than it currently does and be a staple,&quot; she continued. &quot;In addition to consuming cooked young jackfruit, ripe jackfruit, and jackfruit seeds, there are also many food products with longer shelf life that can be made from jackfruit.&quot; Processing the fruit can be offputting, she conceded. The larger fruit give off a strong odour, and ooze a thick white sap. &quot;It is not the easiest fruit,&quot; Zerega said. But jackfruit, breadfruit, and other non-traditional crops are being reexamined because of fears about future food supply. A report from the International Panel on Climate Change last month warned that heatwaves, drought, and unpredictable rainfall patterns were already cutting into yields of wheat and maize. The World Bank&apos;s Dr Jim Yong Kim earlier this month predicted food shortages could lead to wars within the next five to 10 years. &quot;There is just more interest in crops that aren&apos;t the major staples,&quot; she said. &quot;We just don&apos;t have a choice. We are going to have to explore some of these alternative to make sure we are going to be able to nourish people,&quot; Nierenberg said. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 April to correct the spelling of Nyree Zerega&apos;s name.", "publicationDate": "2014-04-23T11:28:58Z", "tags": ["Food", "Environment", "Climate change", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Food security", "Society", "Global development", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Agriculture", "Science"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/23/jackfruit-miracle-crop-climate-change-food-security", "title": "Jackfruit heralded as 'miracle' food crop", "sentences": ["&quot;If you just eat 10 or 12 bulbs of this fruit, you don&apos;t need food for another half a day.&quot;     Jackfruit is sold on a Bangkok street, Thailand."]}, {"article": "Good week for \u2026 Pagan Amum, Oyai Deng Ajak, Majak D&apos;Agoot and Ezekiel Lol Gatkuoth, the South Sudanese senior politicians were freed from prison after the government dropped treason charges against them.

It was the most important piece of land in the Mediterranean for thousands of years and lots of Greek and Arabic influences remain. I&apos;m from northern Italy and I didn&apos;t go to Sicily until I was in my 30s. I&apos;ve been back many times with my family. I&apos;ve put Sicilian dishes on the menu at [my London restaurant] Locanda Locatelli. Sicily changed my cooking: I now use fennel, pistachios, almonds \u2026 The first thing to do when you arrive is rent a car. Italy doesn&apos;t have a well-developed public transport system, and in Sicily it is catastrophic. But the roads are quite good so you can let it rip! There is so much to do: spend a couple of days in each place and then move on. My perfect day would be spent in Mazara del Vallo, a big fishing port. In 1998, a local fisherman caught a statue of a dancing figure in his nets. It turned out to be an ancient bronze satyr, cast between the fourth and second centuries BC. (I&apos;ve met the fisherman who landed it \u2013 he can often be found in the local bars.) The Dancing Satyr is now on display at the town&apos;s Museo del Satiro in the church of Sant&apos;Egidio. The statue is so beautiful and elegant, and most of the time you have the little museum to yourself, but there were huge queues when it came to London&apos;s Royal Academy in 2012. Afterwards I&apos;d go to one of the Tunisian bakeries or restaurants \u2013 there are lots of Tunisian immigrants in Mazara. The most famous archaeological site is the Valley of Temples in Agrigento, but I love Selinunte, further up the coast. The landscape is wilder there. I walk from the beach up and around the remains of the acropolis, necropolis and old market, all from about 650BC. The view is incredible and you can feel the presence of the ancient Greeks.     The cable car at Mount Etna. Photograph: Alamy    Mount Etna, one of the most active volcanoes in the world, is also one of the most beautiful areas of Sicily. You can take the cable car up to 2,500m and then walk to the crater. Make sure you wear warm clothes, even in summer. The view from the top is unbelievable. The island has so many magical places: the ancient amphitheatres of Syracuse; the little town of Erice, where there are more churches than houses; the Norman cathedral of Monreale. The Villa Romana del Casale, just outside the town of Piazza Armerina, has an incredible collection of Roman mosaics. They include beautiful mosaics of girls in bikinis. Romans! In bikinis! My kids thought that was so funny; they loved it. Enna, in the centre of the island, is a huge stone with a town on top. It is so breathtaking, I can&apos;t believe it exists. It has wonderful Easter celebrations, as does M\u00f3dica in the south. Palermo is fantastic for markets. La Vucciria and Ballaro are two of the most exciting, with an Arabic vibe and a craziness reminiscent of Bangkok. You can also buy a beautifully made suit in Palermo, from one of the old sartorie (tailors). A symphony between land and people still exists here. There is a great fishing culture. In Sciacca, you can buy fish direct from the boats \u2013 a \u20ac10 box of sardines will feed 20 people.     Pasta con le sarde. Photograph: Alamy    The dish that epitomises Sicily is pasta con le sarde from Palermo, made with sardines, fennel, saffron, pine kernels, sultanas and a light, sweet tomato sauce. I also love Sicilian fish couscous, which reflects the island&apos;s Arabic heritage \u2013 there is a couscous championship once a year in San Vito lo Capo (6-8 June, couscousfest.it). Food is very seasonal, fresh and cheap. Look around you for pine kernels, pistachios, artichokes. Almonds from Noto. The best peaches are found on street corners in Triscina. When a mafia boss was found in hiding in Sicily, all he had in his fridge was bitter chicory and ricotta. He was probably worth a couple of billion! But in Sicily, you don&apos;t need a huge variety of ingredients. The olive oil is exceptionally good. Groves near the sea have a salinity that you can&apos;t get anywhere else in Italy. I bought some groves and I make my own unfiltered, velvety oil on an estate in Agrigento province. The street food in Palermo is incredible, such as stigghiola (stuffed, grilled lamb intestines) and pane con la milza (spleen sandwiches). In Bagheria you can get the best sfincione (Sicilian pizza). The dough is sweet and soft with the fluffiness of a cloud, almost like a doughnut, and it is topped with onion and anchovies but no tomatoes. (Bagheria also has a fantastic museum dedicated to the painter Renato Guttuso, museoguttuso.it.)     San Vito lo Capo beach. Photograph: Walter Bibikow/Getty    The beach at San Vito lo Capo is like the Caribbean \u2013 white sand, beautiful sea \u2013 and is part of the Zingaro nature reserve. It is also an outstanding spot for kitesurfing. My favourite place to eat is Da Vittoria (ristorantevittorio.it) in Porto Palo di Menfi. A restaurant with rooms, it serves traditional Sicilian fish dishes right on the beach. There is no menu: you get antipasti and pasta and grilled fish. It&apos;s very friendly and relaxed: if you want another bottle of wine, you help yourself from the fridge. Palermitanos go there, and it&apos;s just off one of the major wine routes, so there are usually a few wine tourists too \u2013 Sicily makes fantastic wine. The best ice-cream in the world is at Caff\u00e8 Sicilia in Noto. Noto is a beautiful town \u2013 it was destroyed by an earthquake in 1693 and rebuilt 8km away, so it&apos;s like a stage set. The baroque centre, with a duomo and dozens of churches, is a Unesco world heritage site. You don&apos;t need to book hotels in advance in south-western Sicily. Outside Palermo, off the beaten track, there aren&apos;t many tourists around. The locals are very helpful and will help you find a bed for the night. Sicilians are happy to see foreigners, especially the English \u2013 if a Sicilian gets rich, they start to dress like an English gentleman!     La Foresteria hotel    My favourite hotel is La Foresteria (doubles from \u20ac90, planetaestate.it), an exceptional place on top of a\u00a0little hill in wine country. There is a\u00a0beautiful pool, gardens with 16 kinds of sage, an estate with 250 kinds of birds. Guests all eat together around a\u00a0big, 30-seat dining table. Tourists often worry about the mafia but there&apos;s no need. Most Sicilians are good people and I&apos;ve never experienced any crime. \u2022 Giorgio Locatelli is chef patron of Locanda Locatelli in London (locandalocatelli.com).

Many suggestions in the article, while they may help a little, treat the symptoms rather than the cause. By making insomnia a problem to be fought, there is a danger of making it worse. For example, if you think you must try the latest technique, this creates a tension that increases adrenaline and perpetuates the problem. In my experience, meditation is by far the best approach: rather than fighting insomnia, it brings a sense of calm awareness to it. This may sound counter-intuitive, but when you stop fighting and learn to let go, before long you&apos;re sleeping like a baby.

Occasionally it&apos;s a process that will produce a classic such as The Magnificent Seven (based on Akira Kurosawa&apos;s Seven Samurai) or at least something as interesting as Martin Scorsese&apos;s The Departed (based on Hong Kong cop thriller Infernal Affairs). More often than not, though, it&apos;s an unsatisfying cinematic experience such as Spike Lee&apos;s recent take on the cult Korean revenge thriller Oldboy, Nic Cage&apos;s Bangkok Dangerous, or the endless stream of not-quite-as-scary horrors including Dark Water, The Eye, The Ring or The Grudge. And it&apos;s nearly always a one-way street \u2013 probably because Hollywood blockbusters have reasonable global distribution, so there&apos;s a good chance that audiences around the world will have already seen them, while Asian cinema is still regarded as something of a niche pursuit in the west. Which is why it was so interesting to read about Saidoweizu, a 2009 Japanese remake of the much-loved indie classic Sideways on US film site The Dissolve, this week. That&apos;s right \u2013 there&apos;s an obscure remake of the film that followed Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church drink-driving their way around the vineyards of California&apos;s Napa Valley; the one that nearly killed off the Merlot industry and made sure a certain generation will never be able to say &quot;Pinot Noir!&quot; without mentally adding an exclamation mark. Instead of transplanting the story to Japan (and, say, sending them off on a tour of the finest shochu distilleries), the film packs its two stars, Fumiyo Kohinata and Katsuhisa Namase (Michio and Daisuke instead of Miles and Jack), off to California. Daisuke is getting married to an American, and is pretty keen on the traditional bachelor party in Vegas \u2013 but grumpy pal Michio manages to talk him into sampling the best of Napa wineries \u2013 here, that&apos;s Coppola, Mondavi, Newton and Frog&apos;s Leap \u2013 which is the start of a very familiar looking Californian road trip, complete with fellow Japanese expats Kyoka Suzuki and Rinko Kikuchi (Pacific Rim and Kumiko The Treasure Hunter) to drink and drive with. Kampei! If you&apos;re in the mood for more cross-cultural remakes, how about Ken Watanabe&apos;s recent remake of Clint Eastwood&apos;s Unforgiven (he&apos;s a moody samurai whose sword-swinging days are over), Andy Lau and Gong Li replacing Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt in a Mandarin version of What Women Want (yes, man-wears-women&apos;s-tights is a joke that doesn&apos;t get lost in translation), or Song Seung-heon and Nanako Matsushima taking the Swayze/Moore roles in a tragic love story about a hunky Korean potter who is devastated when his beautiful wife dies \u2013 and then surprised with she gets in touch with him with the help of a friendly psychic who can communicate with the spirit world?

Local food experts and bloggers nominated their favourite dishes, which were then tested by a tasting team.

The UK&apos;s only prize went to London&apos;s Albion, which won best bakery dish for their fried jam croissant. While there are no real surprises on the list, the awards celebrate the quality and variety of authentic regional food around the globe, served at diners, street stalls or food carts rather than exclusive restaurants. Overall winner of the tastiest dish in the world: Ceviche at Chez Wong, Lima, Peru     Winner of Chowzter tastiest item in the world award: cebiche at Chez Wong, Lima, Peru    Ceviche is such a point of pride in Peru that it has its own national holiday \u2013 28 June. Javier Wong, the chef/owner of Chez Wong in Lima, is considered a master of ceviche (spelt cebiche in Peru). His restaurant, which is far from fancy, is in one room of his house, in the rough and tumble district of La Victoria. There&apos;s not even a sign on the door. If you don&apos;t have a reservation, you don&apos;t get in. No exceptions. There&apos;s no menu, substitutions or alterations. Wong works with Pacific sole only. He gets the best pick from the market and is a master with the knife. He breaks down the entire fish at a small table at the head of the dining room and dices it up for a ceviche. He mixes it in a bowl right at the table with just the right amount of salt and lime. On most days, he&apos;ll add octopus, though occasionally you will see squid. It&apos;s served immediately. After the ceviche, you can add a tiradito (a sashimi-like cousin to ceviche) and/or a saltado (stir fry), which Wong prepares in the kitchen in a wok with a high flame. It&apos;s unbelievably simple, yet no one has been able to do it better. Diners reserve months in advance for one of seven tables at Wong&apos;s, proof that with the right ingredients and techniques, a classic recipe from a simple place can be as powerful and tasty as food from the world&apos;s most expensive restaurants.\u2022 Calle Enrique Leon Garcia 114, +511 470 6217.

Upon hearing he planned to visit, the poor nuns went into a panic because they had almost nothing to prepare. They prayed, then brought together the little bits of what they had. The result? A heavenly thick sauce infused with chiles, pepper, peanuts, almonds, cinnamon, anise seed, tomato, onion, garlic and chocolate. Served over meat, the dish has become a culinary symbol of Mexico, and every family and restaurant in Puebla has its own version of the traditional recipe. But the one cooked up by La Casita Poblana strikes the perfect balance between spicy and sweet. Order it served over chicken breast or thigh. \u2022 16 de Septiembre 3912 72580.

The year before, he had become the first person to solve the puzzle in fewer than 10 seconds on average. As a result, he was something of a celebrity, at least in a certain world. On the online forums where competitive Rubik\u2019s Cube solvers congregated, he had been compared to Usain Bolt. In Bangkok, at the Championship, he was asked for autographs and pictures. And, at first, he seemed ready to justify his fame. In the early heats, he blew past the field. But, in the finals, his nerves betrayed him. Now, two years later, in Las Vegas, Zemdegs exhaled and closed his eyes. Two solves down, three to go. When, in the spring of 1974, Ern\u0151 Rubik, a Hungarian professor of design, invented his eponymous cube, he had no idea that it would become one of the world\u2019s best-selling toys. Nor did he envision that it would impact fields as diverse as science, art, and design \u2013 the subject of &quot;Beyond Rubik\u2019s Cube&quot;, an exhibit at the Liberty Science Center, in Jersey City, New Jersey, that opened 26 April to celebrate the puzzle\u2019s 40th anniversary. And he certainly couldn&apos;t have imagined that, one day, his puzzle would be at the center of a competitive sport in which the top performers can re-solve it in less time than it takes to read this sentence aloud.     A Google doodle celebrating the invention of the Rubik's Cube Photograph: /PR    The first Rubik\u2019s Cube competitions began in the early 1980s and were largely a promotional affair that vanished with the collapse of the initial fad for the puzzle. But in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Internet allowed hobbyists around the world to find each other and run competitions of their own. More than 1,700 competitions have taken place in 66 countries since the 2004 founding of the World Cube Association, a governing body modeled after FIFA, the arbiter of international soccer. (Unlike, soccer, however, there is no qualification for any of these tourneys, including the World Championship: anyone can sign up.) Most cubers, as competitors are known, are, as you might expect, young, male, and have an aptitude for math and science. And yet, as Mats Valk, the Dutch teenager who currently holds the world record for a single solve \u2013 5.55 seconds \u2013 insisted at the most recent World Championship last summer, \u201cIf you look at the top, there are actually, like, no nerds at all. Like, me, Feliks, Cornelius \u2013 we are not nerds.\u201d And it\u2019s true that Valk, Zemdegs and Cornelius Dieckmann, an 18-year-old from Berlin, all appear to be well-adjusted teens. Valk, who is tall and lanky with sandy blond hair, has an easy smile and outgoing demeanor. Zemdegs, whose dark hair and angular features recall the tennis player Novak Djokovic, recently entered Melbourne University, one of the most prestigious schools in Australia, where he is pursuing degrees in engineering and business. Dieckmann, who plays classic rock and blues guitar, has a passion for British and American fiction, and would probably fit right in at a party in Brooklyn. But hand one of them a Rubik\u2019s Cube and you will see a seemingly normal person transform into a being capable of prodigious feats. Jeannine Michaelsen, a German TV presenter, came to the 2013 World Championship to film a segment for SportXtreme, a newsmagazine produced by ZDF, one of the country\u2019s most popular channels. \u201cWe all think, \u2018Oh, this looks amazing,\u2019\u201d she said of the sports she typically covers, like Base jumping and big wave surfing. \u201cBut, of course, we know they can do it. But this? If you see this in person, it\u2019s, like, \u2018How the fuck do you do that?\u2019\u201d            The World Cube Association, the governing body of speedsolving, speedcubing or cubing, as it is variously known, requires competitors to attempt five solves, the best and worst of which are eliminated, and the other three times are averaged to make sure that nothing is decided by chance. Before each solve, puzzles are scrambled according to a computer program, to ensure that all competitors begin from the same positions. Zemdegs had likely never seen the particular scramble he had just undone: any single Rubik\u2019s Cube can be arranged in more than 43 quintillion different ways. In real time, what a cuber like Zemdegs or Valk is doing is almost impossible to make out. At times, it looks like the pieces fall into place as they shake the puzzle vigorously. The blur is due in part to advances in puzzle technology; hardly anyone actually uses a Rubik\u2019s Cube in competition anymore. Most cubers employ models designed in China in which the interior mechanism that Rubik originally designed has been revamped to minimize friction. (Occasionally, faster puzzles pose problems. An overzealous turn can cause them to misalign or, in extreme cases, explode.) When Rubik invented his cube, he had little idea how to solve it. No matter which way he turned the puzzle, the colors seemed only to get more mixed up. Still, he refused to believe that it couldn\u2019t be solved. &quot;It was a code I myself had invented!&quot; he wrote in an unpublished manuscript, quoted in a 1986 Discover profile. &quot;Yet I could not read it.&quot; Eventually, Rubik began to develop sequences of moves that would allow him to rearrange a few pieces of the puzzle at a time. First, he aligned the corners. Then, he attacked the edges. After about a month, he could resolve the puzzle at will. Rubik\u2019s solution \u2013 known, for obvious reasons, as the &quot;corners-first&quot; method \u2013 is only one of several ways to solve the cube. You can assemble it layer by layer, like a baker putting together a cake. Or you can build blocks of matching pieces and then connect them, as if you were playing with Legos. The most popular method among cubers is an advanced layer by layer method called the Fridrich Method, after Jessica Fridrich, a professor of engineering at Binghamton University and the 1982 Czech National Champion, who helped to develop it. It&apos;s known alternatively as CFOP, an acronym for the steps involved: cross, first two layers, orientation of the last layer and permutation of the last layer. &quot;It\u2019s the same house, perhaps,&quot; Fridrich told me last year, &quot;but with completely different furniture.&quot; She devised all of her algorithms \u2013 sequences of moves with a discrete effect on the puzzle \u2013 by hand. Today, cubers can generate dozens of alternatives using computers. Fridrich laments that so many cubers now use the same method \u2013 &quot;It\u2019s all been optimized to death,&quot; she quipped \u2013 but is astounded by the speed of her heirs. &quot;I always thought that the limits of speedcubing were, like, at 13 seconds,&quot; she said. &quot;And what\u2019s happening today is just nothing short of a miracle.\u201d     A Rubik's Cube solved using the CFOP method   The biggest factor in the speed of today\u2019s cubers has more to do with practice than anything else. Wayne Gretzky, the greatest hockey player of all time, could famously predict where the puck would travel before it arrived \u2013 a skill he attributed not to innate talent, but simply to his father\u2019s coaching. The same principle applies in cubing. Having solved the puzzle so many times, elite cubers like Valk, Zemdegs, and Dieckmann are able to visualize what it will look like several steps in advance \u2013 an ability known in the sport as &quot;look ahead&quot;\u2013 so that, once the solve begins, they rarely have to pause to figure out their next move. &quot;Look ahead is the biggest part,&quot; Dieckmann says. &quot;It\u2019s even more important than turning fast.&quot; Looking ahead requires enormous concentration, and can be easily derailed by anxiety. So cubers have come up with various ways to calm their nerves. Some don the sort of industrial-grade earmuffs worn by airport personnel. Andy Smith, a teenager from New Jersey, carries a handkerchief \u2013 on which his mother embroidered a Rubik\u2019s Cube \u2013 to wipe the sweat from his hands before he begins solving. When it works, though, look ahead has an uncanny effect, allowing cubers to link moves so seamlessly that their reflexes seem superhuman. On average, CFOP requires 56 twists to solve the Rubik\u2019s Cube. During the fifteen seconds in which competitors are allowed to inspect the puzzle, most are able to plan out a handful of moves. The best never stop looking ahead, and can sustain speeds of nearly ten turns per second. Look ahead demands such concentration that, some cubers say, it alters their perception of time. \u201cIn an ideal solve,\u201d says Stefan Huber, the top-ranked cuber in Austria, &quot;you don\u2019t have the feeling that you were turning fast. You were just turning at a comfortable pace, and, in the end, sometimes I have the experience, when I watch the video, I have the feeling, &apos;Oh, it really looked fast.&apos; But I didn\u2019t have the feeling that it was that fast.&quot; Hardly any of this is conscious. &quot;I don\u2019t know how to explain it,&quot; Zemdegs says, &quot;but you don\u2019t, you don\u2019t really think. You just do it.&quot; &quot;Oh that\u2019s shit, that\u2019s shit,\u201d said one cuber of Zemdegs\u2019 last solve \u2013 9.12 seconds, his slowest of the finals at the championship in Las Vegas. But it didn\u2019t matter. Zemdegs had won the title, with an average of 8.18 seconds. Zemdegs was immediately surrounded by a scrum, while Valk, who came in second, stood off to the side. Although, in some ways, victory was beside the point \u2013 for many of the nearly 600 cubers in attendance, a record, the World Championship was more about hanging out with other cubers, some of whom they had never met offline. But Valk was nevertheless disappointed. On his final solve, he had been penalized two seconds because his puzzle had been misaligned by slightly more than the allowable limit. Still, before Zemdegs accepted his prizes \u2013 $3,000 for winning, and hundreds more for the other contests in which he had placed, including solving the puzzle one-handed \u2013 Valk seemed to cheer up. In the makeshift green room, moments before taking the stage, he had given encouragement to a pale and nervous Zemdegs. &quot;We can do this,&quot; he said. &quot;No, you can do this. Seriously, you deserve to win.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-05-02T15:00:18Z", "tags": ["Game culture", "US news", "World news", "Life and style", "Toys", "Austria", "Hungary", "Science", "Mathematics", "Germany", "Australia news", "Culture", "Technology"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/02/rubiks-cube-competitive-world-speedcubing", "title": "Beyond the Rubik's Cube: inside the competitive world of speedcubing", "sentences": ["In 2011, when he was 15 years old, he traveled to Bangkok from his native Melbourne to attend the biennial World Rubik\u2019s Cube Championship for the first time.", "In Bangkok, at the Championship, he was asked for autographs and pictures."]}, {"article": "At first glance the sprawling campus in the glorious Cotswolds countryside looks an unlikely base from which to wage war against Italy&apos;s most feared crime organisation, the &apos;Ndrangheta. And yet the laboratories of Campden BRI, once part of the University of Bristol and now a major research hub, are, in their own quiet way, playing a vital role in tackling organised crime. The laboratories are not conducting forensic tests on specks of blood or splinters of bone. Rather, they have been contracted by the government&apos;s Rural Payments Agency to carry out chemical tests to establish the purity of olive oil which, since March, has been subject to new EU regulations designed to ensure that consumers get what they believe they are paying for. This is bad news for the &apos;Ndrangheta and other organised criminal gangs, which for decades have been assiduously passing off inferior olive oil and oil from other vegetable sources as the premium extra virgin variety. According to the European parliament&apos;s food safety committee, olive oil is the product most at risk of food fraud, and the rewards for adulteration of it are substantial. Cheap pomace olive oil \u2013 extracted from olive residue using chemicals \u2013 sells for 32.3p per 100ml, compared with \u00a31.50 for extra virgin. &quot;Olive oil is a valuable commodity and fraud is on the increase,&quot; said Dr Julian South, head of chemistry and biochemistry at Campden BRI. &quot;Food authenticity continues to be a high-profile issue, and the testing of olive oils is taking place in all European Union member states.&quot; Jenny Morris, principal policy officer at the Chartered Institute for Environmental Health, acknowledged that olive oil was ripe for fraud. &quot;A lot of people buy virgin olive oil,&quot; she said. &quot;They like the fact that it is high quality and they are prepared to pay a premium. If you are a criminal and you get hold of some oil, not necessarily olive oil, you can colour it green with a bit of chlorophyll and make a lot of money out of it. Because of its distribution, it is sometimes hard to track.&quot; But many other products are almost as vulnerable to criminal adulteration as olive oil. Other popular and lucrative frauds include diluting honey with cheap sugar syrup, passing off methanol as vodka, mixing inferior rice with premium basmati and switching cheap fish such as catfish with expensive alternatives like haddock. It certainly beats mixing cocaine with bulking agents like talcum powder \u2013 an activity that is far riskier than corrupting the food chain, according to experts. &quot;At the moment the risks for criminals operating in this field are low because they are not routinely coming up against trained and organised professional investigators,&quot; Gary Copson, a former Metropolitan police detective and advisor to the government&apos;s Elliot review into food chain integrity, told a parliamentary committee earlier this year. &quot;While there is excellent work being done by trading standards, it is generally focused at a lower level. They don&apos;t have the capacity to work at the higher level that we have seen and suspect is in the background,&quot; Copson said, according to Environmental Health News. The Elliot review, due to report by early June, will help to highlight the extent to which organised crime has penetrated food distribution networks. This became apparent during the horsemeat scandal last year and was confirmed in February following the launch of Operation Opson III, an Interpol campaign that seized more than 1,200\u00a0tonnes of fake or sub-standard food and nearly 430,000 litres of counterfeit drinks. Almost 100 people were arrested or detained in 33 countries, while officers impounded more than 131,000 litres of oil and vinegar, 80,000 biscuits and chocolate bars, 20\u00a0tonnes of spices and condiments, 186 tonnes of cereals, 45\u00a0tonnes of dairy products and 42 litres of honey. The largest amounts of foodstuffs seized were in the fish or seafood category \u2013 including 484 tonnes of yellowfin tuna. Some of the frauds uncovered in the operation came straight from the pages of bad novels. Investigators discovered an organised crime network in Italy behind the manufacture and distribution of fake champagne. Materials to prepare 60,000 bottles, including fake labels, were seized following raids on two sites, with three people arrested and 24 others reported to the authorities. In Bangkok, the Royal Thai police raided a warehouse and recovered more than 270 bottles of fake whisky, as well as forged stickers, labels and packaging. Officials in the Philippines seized nearly 150,000 fake stock cubes, while French police identified and shut down an illegal abattoir on the outskirts of Paris. In Spain, 24 people were detained for illegal work and immigration offences after investigators recovered 4.5 tonnes of snails that had been taken from woods and fields. In the UK, police seized 17,156 litres of counterfeit vodka, with an estimated street value of \u00a31m, worth around \u00a3270,000 to the UK exchequer in duty and VAT. Michael Ellis, head of Interpol&apos;s trafficking in illicit goods and counterfeiting unit, said at the time that the operation would have opened many people&apos;s eyes to the threats posed by organised criminal networks. &quot;Most people would be surprised at the everyday foods and drink which are being counterfeited, and the volume of seizures shows that this is a serious global problem,&quot; he said. But counterfeiting is only one weapon in the criminal gangs&apos; armoury. In Mexico, a drug cartel known as the Knights Templar has recently been taking over lime farms in an area called the Tierra Caliente. The cartel now controls a large proportion of the limes exported to the US, with the result that prices have tripled. The same group is also seeking to control the avocado trade. In some cases, the role of criminal networks in the food chain has proven fatal. More than 40 people were killed by methanol-contaminated vodka and rum in the Czech Republic in 2012. At least one person has died here. UK trading standards departments have warned that there has been a fivefold increase in seizures of counterfeit alcohol since 2009. Fakes have been found to contain a range of dangerous contaminants, including isopropanol, methanol and chloroform. The use of the industrial chemical melamine to increase protein in baby milk powder in China in 2008 also resulted in deaths but also, according to experts, proved that criminal gangs were becoming more sophisticated in their use of technology to carry out fraud. &quot;The most surprising aspect is the ingenuity,&quot; said Stuart Shotton, consultancy services director at Foodchain Europe, which advises the industry on food security. &quot;You&apos;ve got some very clever people \u2013 food technologists; people who are experienced in the industry \u2013 who are making decisions and changes on a scientific basis to figure out what they can do to a product to increase its commercial viability.&quot; Shotton said criminal gangs would move into food fraud if they were attracted by one of two factors. &quot;Either a product is high value but low volume and you want to replace certain elements to make more of a profit, or it is low price [but] high volume, where economies of scale dictate that if you can shave a penny off a product and you are selling a million products, you&apos;ve made a substantial amount of money.&quot; He called on the food industry to learn from other industries, such as fashion brands, if it was going to secure itself successfully against criminal activity. &quot;We don&apos;t have holograms or watermarks \u2013 maybe that&apos;s the route we need to start going down,&quot; Shotton said. However, the full extent to which fraud in the food industry is down to criminal networks is unclear as there is currently a lack of data. Some of the fraud is clearly perpetrated by small-time players rather than organised crime. For example, a London-based importer was recently fined \u00a317,000 after passing off syrup as honey. But even the actions of some small-scale fraudsters can have large-scale repercussions. &quot;Look at [the red dye] Sudan 1,&quot; Morris said. &quot;It was down to enterprising small-scale producers of chilli in Italy realising that if their powder looked redder they&apos;d get more money for it. So how did they make it redder? They put industrial floor dye into it.&quot; The Food Standards Agency acknowledges that reports of known or suspected food fraud have steadily risen year after year since the inception of its food fraud database in 2007. Back then just 49 reports were submitted. Last year the number had increased to 1,538. A spokesman explained that the most common concern \u2013 involving 16% of all reports submitted last year \u2013 was to do with the sale of &quot;unfit food&quot;. Counterfeit alcohol, mostly vodka and wine, was the second-largest issue, representing some 14% of the reports created. But the nature of the food industry means frauds can change very quickly. For clues as to which food groups criminal gangs are considering ripe for future fraud, it may be helpful to look to the US, where something called the Pharmacopeial Convention&apos;s food fraud database tracks media reports of food fraud. Products currently subject to serious fraud include turmeric and chilli powder, cooking oil, shrimp, lemon juice and maple syrup. According to foodqualitynews.com, not one of these was in the top 25 list of food frauds between 1980 and 2010. The Elliot review is expected to recommend that the food industry must &quot;think like a criminal&quot; if it is to thwart criminal activity. This is something other countries have been doing for years. &quot;Look at the Italians,&quot; Morris said. &quot;They deal with a lot of food crime involving premium products like buffalo mozzarella or olive oil. They ask themselves, &apos;Where is the biggest opportunity to make money? Let&apos;s focus there.&apos; The only way you are going to head off the crooks is to have an idea of where they are going to strike and target your surveillance resource there.&quot; Hilary Ross, a lawyer with the firm DWF who has 22 years&apos; experience of food fraud and was a contributor to the Elliot review, agreed there was a need for fresh thinking. &quot;In the last five years we&apos;ve seen an increase in food prices, economic instability, shortages due to climatic changes. When that happens foods prices tend to change and then there is a greater likelihood of fraud.&quot; The secret, Ross suggested, was to examine events that criminals would seek to exploit. &quot;We need intelligence-gathering and horizon-scanning, not just by individuals but by European and international bodies, so that, for example, we can identify if there is going to be a crop shortage. That&apos;s where criminality breeds.&quot; But Morris conceded that keeping the criminal networks in check was nigh-on impossible. &quot;The reality is you will never stop them entirely,&quot; she said. &quot;You just have to look at the biggest opportunities and then try to stop them.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-05-03T19:58:00Z", "tags": ["Organised crime", "Food safety", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "World news", "Food & drink industry", "Business", "UK news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/03/food-fraud-uk-labs-fight-organised-crime-counterfeit", "title": "Cartels and organised crime target food in hunt for riches", "sentences": ["In Bangkok, the Royal Thai police raided a warehouse and recovered more than 270 bottles of fake whisky, as well as forged stickers, labels and packaging."]}, {"article": "For most of us with busy lives it&apos;s quite common to feel under the weather sometimes \u2013 faint, dizzy, exhausted or weak. Usually it&apos;s a passing disturbance, caused by stress, an infection or not enough sleep. But it can be a terrible, and sometimes fatal, mistake to dismiss such episodes as &quot;just a funny turn&quot;. For 46,000 people each year, these symptoms are caused by a TIA \u2013 a transient ischaemic attack \u2013 which is a mini-stroke. If not taken seriously, there&apos;s a real risk of a full stroke happening. I now know a lot about TIAs, but knew nothing two years ago. That&apos;s when my husband, the broadcaster Andrew Marr, had a couple of &quot;funny turns&quot; but thought they were nothing serious. A few months later he went on to have a major, life-changing stroke, which resulted in four months in hospital; eight months off work and permanent disability. We only realised that he had had a couple of TIAs when the hospital surgeon told him that brain scans revealed two earlier &quot;incidents&quot; before his full stroke. At first we were puzzled, but then realised that the clues were there. In retrospect, Andrew&apos;s most obvious TIA happened while he was filming for a BBC history series in northern Greece. He got up early one morning to do a piece to camera in a cave in Macedonia and, most unusually for him, simply couldn&apos;t get the words out. He told me his mouth just stopped working and he had an overwhelming sensation of tiredness. He was helped into the crew car and left to sleep for the afternoon in a local village, after which he felt better and was able to complete filming. At the time he put it down to jet lag (he had been crossing several different time zones during the course of the filming, travelling to Japan, China, the US and Russia.) A month or so later, when back in the UK, he blacked out briefly and couldn&apos;t understand why. This time he was alone, and so wasn&apos;t aware of any speech difficulties. Again, the episode passed off quite quickly and he thought no more of it. After all, he was only 53 and kept himself fit with regular long runs and cycle rides around Richmond Park. If only we had recognised what was going on, Andrew could have had help before his stroke happened. But he didn&apos;t understand it, and neither did I. What was in fact taking place was that a small clot was blocking the blood supply to the brain. In most cases of TIA, the blockage either dissolves itself or moves, so that the blood supply is restored and the person feels normal again, with no permanent damage being done. Often the whole thing will be over in a matter of hours. But sometimes a TIA can lead to a full stroke within a day or two. Sometimes it is the precursor of a stroke in the months ahead, as it was with Andrew. That&apos;s why I am supporting a new campaign from the Stroke Association which aims to raise awareness of the potentially catastrophic consequences of TIAs. A recent survey it carried out among 2,000 members of the public found very little awareness of TIAs, their symptoms and significance. A later survey of 670 people who had recently suffered a TIA revealed that more than half had never heard of a TIA or mini-stroke, and had no idea what was happening to them. According to the Stroke Association, 10,000 strokes a year could be avoided if all TIAs were treated urgently. That&apos;s 10,000 people who could be spared death or disability and 10,000 families who could be spared an immense trauma. We should consider the economic cost, too. Stroke is the third largest cause of death in the UK, and also the largest cause of disability. The cost to the economy, including direct costs to the NHS as well as informal care, benefits paid and lost productivity, is around \u00a39bn, according to a report from the National Audit Office. It&apos;s not just the public who don&apos;t know enough about TIAs. The same survey by the Stroke Association found that 16% of people didn&apos;t feel they were taken seriously when describing their symptoms and 25% reported that health professionals didn&apos;t realise that they had had a TIA. Stories of misdiagnosis range from patients being told they had a migraine, being referred for eye tests or believing they had sciatica. The television presenter Chris Tarrant, who suffered a mini-stroke in March on a flight from Bangkok to London, initially thought he was suffering from asthma. To be fair, TIAs are often hard to diagnose, because the symptoms can vary. The most obvious symptoms are the same as those for stroke: facial weakness, often resulting in a drooping mouth; arm or leg weakness, speech difficulty, blurred vision and dizziness. Yet not all of these happen all of the time. Andrew had no arm or leg weakness during his TIAs. Some of those surveyed declared they hadn&apos;t had any facial weakness, so didn&apos;t think they could be having a mini-stroke. The benefits of quick diagnosis are immense. Clot-busting drugs can be given early to ensure that the blood clot dissolves before any brain damage occurs. Often tests will reveal high blood pressure or high cholesterol, in which case medication such as ACE inhibitors and statins can be prescribed, along with lifestyle changes \u2013 yes, more fruit and vegetables and more exercise. Atrial fibrillation is another condition, often undetected, which affects heart rhythm and increases the risk of clots. So even those who like to think of themselves as young and fit shouldn&apos;t rule out getting tests if they do suffer &quot;a funny turn&quot;. As with so many health conditions, there is a postcode lottery when it comes to TIAs. Some parts of the country now have specialised clinics for rapid diagnosis and staff in the ambulance service and in GP surgeries have received excellent training in how to spot the symptoms of a mini-stroke. But in other places you could well get sent home with a paracetamol. Follow-up care is also patchy. One patient reported that she only realised she had suffered a TIA when she read her medical notes \u2013 no one at the hospital had bothered to tell her, nor followed up her symptoms. Southend University hospital is one that leads the way. Its TIA clinic used to open only five days a week and could only see three patients a day. But since 2012 the service has become a seven days a week operation \u2013 essential, since strokes and mini-strokes don&apos;t respect weekday working hours \u2013 and all high-risk patients are seen within 24 hours. A rapid referral system using the internet and mobile phones means that there is much less likelihood of a patient being left to have a full stroke while waiting to be seen. The key factor in making a good recovery from a stroke is speed: the sooner a patient is treated, the less likelihood there is of permanent damage. So the advice to those without a good TIA clinic nearby is to go straight to A&amp;E. What happens if you don&apos;t act fast? Well, 16 months on from his stroke, my husband is still left with a pretty useless left arm and has to wear an electronic device with an ankle brace to help him walk. He endures or enjoys (depending on whether you talk to Andrew or the physiotherapists) five hours of physiotherapy every week and performs endless repetitive exercises to try to recover better function in his left arm and leg. And he was one of the lucky ones: his cognitive skills and memory were not affected, as they often are with a stroke. No one can spend their life saying &quot;if only&quot;. You have to accept where you are and get on with it. But if only we had known a bit more about TIAs a couple of years ago, life would have been very different. If this new campaign from the Stroke Association can prevent any strokes at all, let alone 10,000 a year, then it will be very worthwhile. A funny turn could otherwise turn out to be not very funny at all.", "publicationDate": "2014-05-03T23:05:32Z", "tags": ["Health & wellbeing", "Health", "Society", "Andrew Marr", "Media", "Neuroscience", "Life and style"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/04/andrew-marr-warning-signs-stroke", "title": "My husband Andrew Marr missed the warning signs of his stroke.

In a unanimous decision, the constitutional court ruled that Yingluck had acted with a hidden agenda when she transferred a senior civil servant to another position shortly after taking office in 2011. &quot;The prime minister&apos;s status has come to an end,&quot; one of the court&apos;s nine judges said in a statement broadcast live on television. &quot;Yingluck can no longer stay in her position acting as caretaker prime minister.&quot; Analysts called the ruling a &quot;new and potentially dangerous escalation&quot; of Thailand&apos;s political crisis.

While Yingluck&apos;s Pheu Thai party described the verdict as a virtual coup and conspiracy to oust her from government, the 46-year-old accepted the decision in an emotional press conference. &quot;I am proud of every minute I have worked as prime minister, because I came from a democratic election,&quot; she said. Yingluck was accused of removing Thailand&apos;s then chief of national security, Thawil Pliensri \u2013 who had been appointed by the opposition \u2013 in order to promote her brother-in-law to another post as national police chief. Although such a move was legal, the court ruled, it was done too quickly and without &quot;moral principles&quot;. The court also ruled that the nine current cabinet ministers who were in office at the time of the transfer must also step down \u2013 among them the labour, finance and foreign ministers. While anti-government protesters are likely to be happy to see Yingluck gone, the verdict falls short of their desire to see her entire government removed. The commerce minister, Niwatthamrong Boonsongpaisan, was named by the Thai cabinet as Yingluck&apos;s replacement until a planned general election on 20 July. While the Pheu Thai party is widely expected to win \u2013 variations of the party have won every election since 2001 \u2014 it is unclear whether anti-government protesters will allow the election to go ahead. A snap election called by Yingluck on 2 February was marred by violence and protests, with whole provinces prevented from voting. Yingluck&apos;s supporters \u2013 who mainly come from Thailand&apos;s rural north and north-east \u2013 have vowed to hold a rally on Saturday and argue that the courts have sought to topple her at the behest of anti-government protesters led by the People&apos;s Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC). The protesters accuse her of acting as a proxy for her brother Thaksin, the former prime minister who was removed from government in 2006 and now lives in self-exile in Dubai. They have staged rallies and sit-ins at government buildings since November, sparked by the midnight passage of an amnesty bill that would have allowed Thaksin to return from exile. &quot;The opposition will try to delay [elections] until unspecified political reforms are carried out,&quot; said Thailand analyst Jacob Hamstra of the Economist Intelligence Unit. &quot;These changes, presumably, would in effect increase the influence of the anti-Thaksin military and bureaucratic establishment in Bangkok at the expense of Thailand&apos;s poor, rural majority.&quot; Wednesday&apos;s verdict is not unusual. Yingluck is the third Shinawatra-linked prime minister to be judicially removed from post since 2006, a point that analysts stress marks a &quot;fascinating development in the Shinawatra saga&quot; of political to-and-froing since his ousting. &quot;What is interesting about the current iteration is the bloodless, legal nature of the approach,&quot; says Liam McCarthy, an expert on south-east Asia at Nottingham Trent University. &quot;Using the legal process to take what the coup couldn&apos;t secure, and the polls couldn&apos;t guarantee.&quot; While Wednesday&apos;s ruling could be seen as a victory for the PDRC, it is unlikely to assuage protesters, who may now turn on the new caretaker prime minister, said Thitinan Pongsudhirak of Thailand&apos;s Institute of Security and International Studies. &quot;They lost Yingluck but they haven&apos;t lost her government, so I think we are set up for more drama,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;He [Niwatthamrong Boonsongpaisan] is really a Thaksin lackey and Yingluck confidante, and now that he is acting PM, I suspect very quickly that will become the new lightning rod \u2013 [as] he comes from the family business.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-05-08T05:20:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Thaksin Shinawatra", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/07/thai-prime-minister-yingluck-shinawatra-steps-down", "title": "Thai prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra forced to step down", "sentences": ["&quot;These changes, presumably, would in effect increase the influence of the anti-Thaksin military and bureaucratic establishment in Bangkok at the expense of Thailand&apos;s poor, rural majority.&quot; Wednesday&apos;s verdict is not unusual."]}, {"article": "T20 Cricket: Nottinghamshire Outlaws v Lancashire Lightning6pm, Sky Sports 2 To the whirring accompaniment of what is most likely WG Grace revolving in his grave, the T20 Blast series sees counties pitted against one other in evening fixtures over the course of the weekend.

The move, which came as a surprise, was announced on the military&apos;s television channel and sparked fears that the move was part of a coup d&apos;etat. Thailand&apos;s army, which has staged 11 successful coups since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932, said in a statement that it had taken the action to &quot;keep peace and order&quot; and soldiers entered several private television stations that are sympathetic to protesters. A ticker on Channel 5, an army station, however, denied the military was taking over, saying &quot;the invocation of martial law is not a coup.&quot; Violence in recent months mark the latest episode in eight years of upheaval that has pitted the largely rural supporters of populist former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra against the Southeast Asian nation&apos;s traditional elites. The crisis deepened the week before last when Thailand&apos;s constitutional court removed Yingluck Shinawatra from her position as prime minister for nepotism along with nine cabinet members in a case that many viewed as politically motivated. Protesters say Yingluck&apos;s removal is not enough. Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan, who took over as caretaker prime minister, is from the same ruling party. Three people were killed in explosions and a shooting attack against anti-government demonstrators last Wednesday as the country&apos;s electoral commission called for a July election rerun to be postponed. The deaths riased the nationwide toll since protests began last November to 27 dead and 800 wounded. A senior US defence official told the Associated Press news agency last week that the US was &quot;reasonably confident&quot; that Thailand&apos;s military would not launch a coup, although analysts have warned the nation&apos;s political crisis could trigger armed conflict. A spokesman for the army, Winthai Suvaree, also told Reuters last week: &quot;The military is not planning to stage a coup and it will let politicians sort the country&apos;s problems out.&quot; In 2006 the army sent tanks and troops into the capital to wrest power from the then prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, as he attended the United Nations general assembly in New York. It had been the army&apos;s first military intervention in 15 years. Shinawatra fled Thailand in 2008 after being given a jail term and while a government of his allies was elected in the first post-coup polls it was later removed by the courts.

Last summer, the team behind it opened Shears Yard, an open-plan bar-restaurant in a historic workshop that, with its exposed brick, open eaves and stark minimalism, looks a little 1990s itself. Which I quite like. It is a refreshing change from the now ubiquitous distressed Brooklyn dive bar look. The food charts a similarly individual path through modern food. There are burgers, but smart ones (lobster, crayfish and mackerel), while the main dishes mix and match traditional (bubble-and-squeak croquettes) with trendy ingredients and techniques (black garlic emulsion, roast kohlrabi), in interesting ways. It&apos;s pretty sophisticated stuff: the two-course set-menu is good value although not exactly a budget price at \u00a314.50. At lunch, though, you can get a taste for what&apos;s going on here, via those burgers, gussied-up sandwiches and some terrific meat and vegetarian tasting boards. I don&apos;t know what the caramelised onion chutney was meant for, or if it should have been there at all, but otherwise my fish platter (\u00a38.95) was great. It comprised rustling whitebait and a lemony mayo as thick as gloss paint; a slightly worthy mackerel pat\u00e9 next to a mound of excellent dill-pickled courgettes; and crayfish on dressed leaves. The star of the show, however, was the home-cured sea trout. These thick, Lucozade-orange tranches had the firm, sticky texture of liquorice, with hints of the curing ingredients (tea?) and yet had a bright, saline freshness.

Construction work in Sovereign Place meant El Topo was a pig to find (it is much easier to reach from Neville Street). And then, thanks to a logistical problem, the kitchen only had (yawn!) pulled pork ready for its San Francisco-style burritos. I was ready to write it off, but then I had a bite\u2026 and, well, wow. First, that pulled pork was something else: soft as velvet, juicy as hell and full of slow-cooked flavour. This was nothing like that dry, fibrous interloper which you now come across everywhere. More than that, everything (red rice, black beans, vibrant salsa) tasted fresh and cooked to a T, and all the components were in balance. The sour cream and cheese made their presence known, but in a civilised, restrained way. They didn&apos;t overwhelm the burrito. All told, it was the best burrito I have eaten in some time. And if you want yours jazzing up with guacamole, hot sauce or jalapenos, El Topo will do it free of charge.

Read down its peg-board menu, however (drip-filter, Square Mile beans, 12-hour cold-brewed tea) and you are left in no doubt about the seriousness of this endeavour. That is further borne out by a fastidiously silky flat white that delivered big, full-spectrum coffee flavour (\u00a32.50). Sadly, Laynes was out of breakfast rarebit (no, I don&apos;t want granola instead, thanks), but I swung back later for a sandwich and cake. The former, while not huge, was one of those sandwiches that reminds you how good a simple sarnie can be when all its constituent parts \u2013 pastrami that delivers a long, peppery heat, serious rye from Leeds Bread Co-op \u2013 are A1.

In fact, this late-night DJ bar and event space is one of Leeds&apos; hippest hangouts, well-known for its discerning music policy, good food and craft beer. The menu is simple but effective: first-rate ingredients are employed in sourdough sandwiches; platters of meats and cheeses offer good things to share and pick at; while outsized scotch eggs and pork pies (not &quot;homemade&quot; as the menu rather misleadingly suggests but, when I query it, bought in from the Greedy Pig and the Little Yorkshire Pie Co) round out the offer. The Grub &amp; Grog Shop, from local producer Made By Jim, pops up each Friday lunchtime offering stews, seasonal salads and affordable hot sandwiches, such as slow-cooked lamb and pickled rhubarb with pea puree and mint dressing on a Leeds Bread Co-Op ciabatta.

In broad terms, he sources top-notch ingredients and lets them speak for themselves. They are assembled in interesting combinations across a menu of salads, deli platters and upmarket sandwiches (deep-fried halloumi, say, with harissa, red peppers and tzatziki), which this experienced chef then cleverly tweaks, at the periphery. For instance, on a daisy-fresh croissant, smoked salmon of a smooth complexity is dressed with long ribbons of cucumber and blobs of an unusually clean, citrus-spiked creme fraiche. Elsewhere, Hepworth busies himself rustling up panko-crumbed scotch eggs, quiches, slick cakes and hot sandwiches, such as his lunchtime special of fish fingers and homemade tartar sauce. The breakfast menu, which includes eggs Benedict, French toast and pancakes, looks terrific, too. As for Hepworth&apos;s fondness for serving everything on slates, we will have to discuss that another time, but the deli \u2013 its shelves lined with everything from bacon jam to Yorkshire fudge \u2013 would benefit from less gloomy lighting. \u2022 Snack items and sandwiches \u00a31-\u00a33.95, platters \u00a37.25-\u00a38.50. 21 Thorntons Arcade, 07938 960517, hepworthsdeli.co.uk Trinity Kitchen Ordinarily, you might walk the long way round just to avoid Trinity, a huge, shiny new shopping centre in Leeds city centre. Trinity Kitchen, however \u2013 a food court stuffed with chain names but also, crucially, five food trucks, vans and shacks that change on a monthly basis \u2013 is a pretty irresistible lure. Those mobile guests are chosen in collaboration with the organiser of the British Street Food Awards, Richard Johnson, which means that London&apos;s best (such as Original Fry Up Material; the Cheese Truck, whose grilled sandwiches look incredible; and Big Apple Hotdogs), regularly rub shoulders here with Leeds outfits such as Marvellous Tea Dance , Fish&amp; and Manjit&apos;s Kitchen. Many of the northern traders are members of the energetic Northern StrEats association, a key name to look out for locally.

On closer inspection that menu \u2013 ham hock with homemade piccalilli sandwich, eight-hour cooked pulled pork with the Pig&apos;s own spicy barbecue slaw, brisket burger with blue cheese and dry-cured bacon \u2013 is pretty trendy. The Pig serves coffee from local micro-roastery North Star and its legendary pork and chorizo scotch eggs are served in hip Leeds bars. What the Pig delivers is sometimes less miraculous than the hype but, nonetheless, a large breakfast bap of decent bacon, properly fried until it had taken on a rusty char, topped with a thick wedge of smooth, quietly spicy black pudding, was \u00a32.40 very well spent.

The latter is so good you will find it on the menu at super-picky local pig joint Friends of Ham . At night, most main courses break our \u00a310 cut-off but, during the day, you can sample those complex air-dried meats on deli boards, or take your pick from fish finger and meatball sandwiches and a short menu that includes such rib-stickers as homemade black pudding with potato, spinach and poached egg, and Erdinger-battered fish and chips. The Reliance is also a good place to recover over Sunday brunch (\u00a33.25-\u00a37.50). I enjoyed a glass of Saltaire Brewery&apos;s South Island Pale (half pint \u00a31.65) then, with more beer in mind, pottered along to North Bar, arguably Leeds&apos; best craft beer bar. Keen to ensure that your stomach is lined, North serves snack boards of charcuterie from the Reliance, alongside toasties and pies from renowned Leeds butcher Wilsons.

My bravura veggie sample, Paul &amp; Linda, with smoked mozzarella, fat caperberries, artichoke and pools of lemony-fresh salsa verde, was, at \u00a31.40, a complete bargain. At the other end of the bar, Patty&apos;s serves superlative cheeseburgers from \u00a35 that, dripping with cheese and meat juices (and momentarily steamed under a cloche before serving), are so soft and yielding, so plump and squishy, you could almost slurp them down. The skin-on chips are, likewise, earthy, golden and seriously moreish. On their own, they would make a godlike beer snack. The cost for the two? \u00a36.50.

The army&apos;s commander, General Prayuth Chan-ocha said the military had stepped in to restore order, and invited both sides of the kingdom&apos;s bitter political divide to talks. &quot;We ask all sides to come and talk to find a way out for the country,&quot; Prayuth told reporters after meeting directors of government agencies and other high-ranking officials. Prayuth warned pro- and anti-government protesters to avoid violence, and said martial law would be revoked after peace and order had been restored. Earlier, the military insisted the intervention was not a coup d&apos;etat and said in a statement: &quot;The public do not need to panic and can continue on with normal life.&quot; The statement \u2013 read out in one of a number of televised proclamations \u2013 said the military had been compelled to act because &quot;groups with bad intentions&quot; risked escalating a six-month-long political crisis by threatening to overthrow the elected government. &quot;The royal Thai army intends to bring back peace and order to the beloved country of every Thai as soon as possible,&quot; said Prayuth in the statement, adding: &quot;We intend to see the situation resolved quickly.&quot; On Monday, the caretaker prime minister, Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan, refused protesters&apos; demands to step down. The army did not inform the caretaker government of its plan to declare martial law. While troops were deployed along a number of roads in Bangkok and soldiers took back Government House and other buildings that had been occupied by anti-government protesters, the situation in the capital remained largely calm, with schools and businesses open and traffic flowing as usual. The justice minister, Chaikasem Nitisiri, told the Associated Press that although the army had not consulted Niwattumrong about the declaration, the caretaker government was still running the country and the army was in charge of security. &quot;Security matters will be handled solely by the military, and whether the situation intensifies or is resolved is up to them,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no cause to panic.&quot; Thailand has been gripped by off-and-on political turmoil since 2006 when the then prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, was toppled by a military coup after being accused of corruption, abuse of power and disrespect for King Bhumibol Adulyadej. The army, which is seen by many as sympathetic to anti-government protesters, has staged 11 coups since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932. One anti-government protester, Wichada, who has been on the streets for nearly 200 days, welcomed the intervention. &quot;We&apos;re very happy about the army&apos;s announcement because it means they are on our side,&quot; she told the Guardian from a protest camp next to Democracy Monument in Bangkok&apos;s old city. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a specialist on Thai affairs and associate professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said martial law could break the impasse of the past six months. &quot;The government is unable to govern, and the protesters&apos; goals haven&apos;t been realised, so both sides now have to answer to martial law,&quot; he said. Thitinan said the army had placed itself in a precarious position. &quot;It now has to walk a tightrope, not too far in the government&apos;s camp, not too far in the protesters&apos; camp. The army had better have a good game plan \u2013 the other sides knew what they wanted, but it&apos;s not clear if the army does.&quot; The latest round of unrest started last November when anti-government protesters took to the streets to try to oust the then prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, Thaksin&apos;s sister. She dissolved the lower house of parliament in December in an attempt to ease the crisis, and then led a weakened, caretaker government with limited powers. This month, the constitutional court ousted Yingluck and nine cabinet ministers for abuse of power, but the move has done little to resolve the political conflict that pits the rural poor majority, who support Yingluck, against her opponents who are largely drawn from the urban middle and upper class. An overnight attack last week on the main anti-government protest site left three dead and more than 20 injured. It raised the death toll since November to 28 and drew a strong rebuke from the army chief. Along with the declaration of martial law, the army issued an order suspending a number of television and radio stations, which have provided platforms for both political camps to air often aggressive rhetoric. At least 10 politically affiliated private TV stations from both sides stopped broadcasting \u2013 after armed soldiers entered and requested they do so. The leader of the pro-government Red Shirt movement, Jatuporn Prompan, said his group could accept the imposition of martial law, but said they &quot;won&apos;t tolerate a coup or other non-constitutional means&quot; to grab power. &quot;We will see what the army wants,&quot; he said, warning that the undemocratic removal of the country&apos;s caretaker government &quot;will never solve the country&apos;s crisis and will plunge Thailand deeper into trouble&quot;. The US state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Washington was &quot;very concerned about the deepening political crisis in Thailand&quot;. She said it urged &quot;all parties to respect democratic principles, including respect for freedom of speech \u2026 We expect the army to honour its commitment to make this a temporary action to prevent violence, and to not undermine democratic institutions.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-05-20T07:47:07Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/20/thai-army-declares-martial-law", "title": "Thai army declares martial law", "sentences": ["Thailand&apos;s army has declared martial law, deploying troops in the heart of Bangkok before dawn in an attempt to end months of political turmoil and violence that has claimed 28 lives to date.", "While troops were deployed along a number of roads in Bangkok and soldiers took back Government House and other buildings that had been occupied by anti-government protesters, the situation in the capital remained largely calm, with schools and businesses open and traffic flowing as usual.", "&quot;We&apos;re very happy about the army&apos;s announcement because it means they are on our side,&quot; she told the Guardian from a protest camp next to Democracy Monument in Bangkok&apos;s old city.", "Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a specialist on Thai affairs and associate professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said martial law could break the impasse of the past six months."]}, {"article": "Thailand&apos;s army declared martial law at dawn on Tuesday \u2013 a surprising move after six months of deadly clashes in a protracted battle to overthrow the elected government. It remains unclear whether this is an attempt to restore peace and order, as the military has indicated, or the beginning of another political ousting in a nation that has seen 18 coups in the last 80 years. Why is Thailand in crisis? Thailand has been divided for years between pro-establishment, mostly urban &quot;yellow shirts&quot; and largely working class, rural &quot;red shirts&quot; who support the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Thaksin&apos;s removal in military coup in 2006 is still a sore point for the millions of red shirts who continue to vote for variations of his party, which has won every election for the past decade. Yellow shirts have been protesting for the past six months to remove the current manifestation of the Thaksin-aligned government from office, claiming it is corrupt. Thaksin&apos;s sister Yingluck, who was voted in as PM in 2011, was forced from power this month by a court ruling, in many observers deemed a judicial coup. Led by the veteran politician Suthep Thaugsuban, the yellow shirts say they will not back down until an unelected government is installed that can institute reforms. The red shirts have promised to stand their ground and have threatened civil war if the democratically elected government is deposed. Is this a coup? Thailand&apos;s army has staged 18 coups since absolute monarchy was abolished in 1932, including the one that ousted Thaksin. But it said Tuesday&apos;s move was merely to &quot;provide safety to the people&quot;. In one of many televised proclamations, military officials said: &quot;This is not a coup \u2013 the public do not need to panic and can go about their lives as normal.&quot; But with armed soldiers and tanks dotted around Bangkok, it would seem very much like this was, in fact, a coup. Human Rights Watch has called it a de facto coup. The army has temporarily banned any broadcast or publication &quot;detrimental to national security&quot;; asked 10 politically affiliated satellite and cable TV stations to cease broadcasts; prevented protesters from marching outside of their protest areas; and told police to reinforce the military, if requested. The arrmy chief, General Prayuth Chan-Ocha, has said he is keen to get both protesting sides to the negotiating table, and has appointed an advisory committee to maintain peace, comprising the heads of the navy, air force and police. Although the current caretaker government was not warned of the army&apos;s plans to invoke martial law, it is still in control \u2013 at least for now, said Panitan Wattanayagorn, a military affairs analyst at Chulalongkorn University. &quot;By law, you can declare martial law first and then inform the government later,&quot; he said. Observers may see parallels to the coup in 2006. The main difference between now and then, Panitan said, was that the army then was &quot;very clearly taking over&quot;. &quot;It seems now they are not overthrowing the government, but that is questionable if you question the [army&apos;s] motives,&quot; he said. &quot;So the motives here have to be clear \u2013 first by the army identifying the threats [to the public and government] clearly and transparently, and then allowing conflicting parties to negotiate their way through senate or parliament.&quot; What does martial law mean for Thailand&apos;s future? Thailand has been through a considerable number of bumps over the past six months. Yingluck&apos;s attempt to push through an amnesty bill that would allow Thaksin to return from self-imposed exile sparked protests by yellow shirts that have continued non-stop. Much now hinges on the capacity of both sides to stay calm. Thaksin, who holds large sway over his millions of supporters, tweeted on Tuesday that the declaration of martial law was &quot;expected&quot;, and said he hoped it would not &quot;damage the democratic process more than it already has been&quot;. The red shirts have encouraged followers to keep calm and avoid any confrontation with soldiers. Their governing UDD body said this was &quot;no coup yet&quot;. The protest leader Suthep said on his Facebook page that protesters should remain at their sites, per army recommendations, and requested that the senate appoint a new prime minister to replace the current caretaker PM, Niwatthamrong Boonsongpaisan. For some in government, it was unclear exactly why the army chief imposed full martial law instead of just a state of emergency, as was declared earlier this year. Kissana Phathanacharoen, of the Centre for Administration of Peace and Order, which was dissolved under martial law, said: &quot;There will always be rumours of a coup d&apos;etat but no one can actually prove them until the army performs the coup d&apos;etat. If the situation returns to normalcy then the army may revoke the application for martial law.&quot; Thailand&apos;s stock exchange plummeted on Tuesday, with a number of nations questioning the Thai military&apos;s role in politics. Liam McCarthy, an expert on south-east Asia at Nottingham Trent University, said: &quot;This poses a threat to the security of Thailand, both in terms of the safety of the people, and the integrity of the state. Whether this is merely a short-term attempt to resolve the current crisis, or a more permanent seizing of power, is yet to be seen.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-05-20T11:44:23Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/20/thailand-martial-law-coup", "title": "Thailand Q&A: is this another coup?", "sentences": ["In one of many televised proclamations, military officials said: &quot;This is not a coup \u2013 the public do not need to panic and can go about their lives as normal.&quot; But with armed soldiers and tanks dotted around Bangkok, it would seem very much like this was, in fact, a coup."]}, {"article": "Cannes 2014 has already served up some steaming turkeys. And although the directorial debut of Ryan Gosling isn&apos;t quite an out-and-out dud, its high profile means those reflecting back will likely recall Lost River in the same breath as The Captive and Grace of Monaco, rather than Foxcatcher and Mr Turner. Our own Peter Bradshaw gave the film a two-star review, and a qualified drubbing. They shouldn&apos;t have let him do it, says the Guardian critic, but they might not have been entirely misguided in giving him the nod.   It is colossally indulgent, shapeless, often fantastically and unthinkingly offensive and at all times insufferably conceited. Yet it is frustrating precisely because it sometimes isn&apos;t so bad.

Others have been less kind.

Speaking just hours after the Thai army invoked the nationwide, late-night decree \u2013 which was announced at 3am on Tuesday and without government knowledge \u2013 caretaker prime minister Niwatthamrong Boonsongpaisan insisted that his government was still running the nation and promised it would &quot;engage in reforms&quot; before new elections took place, which he called for August. The invocation of martial law was intended to &quot;restore peace and order&quot; amid threats of civil war and a government overthrow, the army said, although many have been left wondering whether the military \u2013 which has launched 18 coups over the last 80 years \u2013 is really attempting to keep the peace, as it claims, or depose the government. By early morning on Tuesday armed soldiers and tanks had been rolled out through Thailand&apos;s capital Bangkok, although the city remained largely peaceful and some Thais took the opportunity to take selfies next to the tanks. The army ordered the closure of a number of partisan TV stations, warned protesters not to march outside of their protest areas, banned media from reports that could be &quot;detrimental to national security&quot; and told police they must reinforce the military, if required. While some observers pointed out parallels to 2006, when a military coup deposed the then-premier Thaksin Shinawatra \u2013 a highly polarising figure still at the root of the current political tensions \u2013 army chief general Prayuth Chan-ocha said in a televised address: &quot;This is not a coup. The public do not need to panic and can continue with normal life.&quot; He added: &quot;We ask all sides to come and talk to find a way out for the country.&quot; Anti-government protesters have been trying since November to depose the incumbent Pheu Thai government, which they claim is a corrupt proxy of former PM Thaksin, and have called on the Thai senate to appoint a new premier. They are not interested in any calls for new elections \u2013 possibly because the incumbent party, or variations of it, has won every election for the past 10 years \u2013 resulting in a legislative paralysis. Violent clashes between the two sides have seen 28 people killed and 700 injured over the past six months. Things were made worse when Thaksin&apos;s sister, former PM Yingluck, was dismissed this month with nine ministers, after a controversial court ruling found them guilty of abusing their power. Caretaker PM Niwatthamrong has since replaced Yingluck but is himself in a precarious position \u2013 having been chased out of meetings with the election commission by protesters and refusing calls to step down. Observers spent the day debating whether the invocation of martial law was a coup, a soft coup, or a de facto coup, as various analysts termed it. Although the caretaker government was not warned of the army&apos;s plans to invoke martial law, that didn&apos;t necessarily indicate it was being taken over, said Panitan Wattanayagorn, a military affairs analyst at Chulalongkorn University &quot;By law, you can declare martial law first and then inform the government later,&quot; he said. &quot;It seems now they are not overthrowing the government, but that is questionable if you question the [army&apos;s] motives,&quot; he added. &quot;So the motives here have to be clear \u2013 first by the army identifying the threats [to the public and government] clearly and transparently, and then allowing conflicting parties to negotiate their way through senate or parliament.&quot; While Prayuth has offered to help the two sides resolve their political differences, both camps have vowed to continue protesting. Anti-government leader Suthep Thaugsuban, who has led supporters to camp out across Bangkok and lay siege to government buildings over the past few months, told supporters: &quot;We will still keep fighting \u2013 we haven&apos;t won.&quot; Pro-government leaders urged calm but warned if a new PM were appointed, things could &quot;escalate&quot;. Thailand&apos;s stock market plummeted amid the news of the decree, with a number of nations, including the US and EU, as well as human rights groups, expressing concern over the Thai military&apos;s hand in politics. &quot;Thailand&apos;s military has a long history of coups d&apos;etat and tearing up constitutions,&quot; said Jaturong Boonyarattanasoontorn of the Union for Civil Liberty. &quot;It is deeply troubling that, yet again, the army shows utter disregard for the rule of law in the name of national security.&quot; The US embassy in Bangkok warned the martial law decree should only be a &quot;temporary action to prevent violence&quot;, while the EU said: &quot;The priority now is to set a clear timetable for early elections and establish as soon as possible a fully functioning government with democratic legitimacy.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-05-20T18:13:30Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/20/thailand-martial-law-talks-stalemate", "title": "Thai army imposes martial law and calls for talks to resolve stalemate", "sentences": ["By early morning on Tuesday armed soldiers and tanks had been rolled out through Thailand&apos;s capital Bangkok, although the city remained largely peaceful and some Thais took the opportunity to take selfies next to the tanks.", "Anti-government leader Suthep Thaugsuban, who has led supporters to camp out across Bangkok and lay siege to government buildings over the past few months, told supporters: &quot;We will still keep fighting \u2013 we haven&apos;t won.&quot; Pro-government leaders urged calm but warned if a new PM were appointed, things could &quot;escalate&quot;.", "&quot;It is deeply troubling that, yet again, the army shows utter disregard for the rule of law in the name of national security.&quot; The US embassy in Bangkok warned the martial law decree should only be a &quot;temporary action to prevent violence&quot;, while the EU said: &quot;The priority now is to set a clear timetable for early elections and establish as soon as possible a fully functioning government with democratic legitimacy.&quot;"]}, {"article": "In recent months, the F-word has been gaining currency in Thailand: observers are increasingly using &quot;fascist&quot; to describe the goals and methods of those determined to bring down the elected government, which is clinging to power despite a series of blows from its opponents in the courts and on the streets. The army&apos;s declaration of martial law in the early hours of Tuesday \u2013 without consulting the government \u2013 further undermines the embattled administration and the kingdom&apos;s fragile democracy. Under the Martial Law Act of 1914, military commanders now have wide-ranging powers to detain suspects, censor the media, impose curfews and prohibit public gatherings. Fourteen television stations have been taken off the air, and the Bangkok Post reported on Wednesday that the military was &quot;restricting comments on TV and in the print media by prohibiting remarks that could confuse society or provoke violence&quot;. There were also reports that books on Thai politics had been taken off the shelves at some shops. This was a clearly a coup in all but name, and it was greeted with deep concern by the international community. As Brad Adams of Human Rights Watch said, &quot;Thailand&apos;s friends in the world&apos;s capitals should make it clear that they expect this de facto coup to be reversed immediately.&quot; The causes of the bitter conflict tearing Thailand apart are complex, and civil war remains a strong possibility. The army justified the imposition of martial law by claiming it was necessary to restore order amid heightened tensions and fears that rival groups would clash in the streets. For the past six months, the former deputy prime minister Suthep Thaugsuban has led protests aimed at unseating the Pheu Thai government, which won a 2011 election observers said was largely free and fair. In February, it won another election, which was boycotted by the opposition Democrat party while Suthep&apos;s thugs blocked polling stations. The inept, elitist and misnamed Democrats, led by the Eton- and Oxford-educated Abhisit Vejjajiva, appear to have given up on parliamentary democracy altogether. The government commands strong support in the rural north and north-east of the country, while the protesters are drawn mainly from Bangkok&apos;s middle class and elite, and from opposition strongholds in the south. They claim the government is controlled by the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was overthrown in a 2006 coup and now lives in Dubai; he faces a two-year jail sentence if he returns to Thailand. Thaksin, a policeman-turned-telecoms-billionaire, is a deeply divisive politician who appealed directly to the rural masses, upsetting the status quo and making many enemies among the traditional elite. Many of the middle-class protesters make no effort to conceal their scorn for the government&apos;s &quot;red shirt&quot; supporters, whom they portray as ignorant, uneducated &quot;buffalos&quot;. In doing so, they display only their own ignorance. A few days ago, it emerged that the newly crowned Miss Thailand Universe had said on Facebook the red shirts were dirty, and the leaders should be executed. A member of the election commission, which organises polls, previously described the red shirts as &quot;low class and vile&quot;. Suthep and his followers have vowed to &quot;eradicate the Thaksin regime&quot;. They have powerful allies in the military and the heavily politicised courts, which have repeatedly ruled against the government. Earlier this month, Thaksin&apos;s sister Yingluck, who was elected prime minister in 2011, was dismissed by the courts over the transfer of an official who was openly hostile to her government. It was the third time a prime minister loyal to Thaksin had been dismissed by a dubious court decision; one lost his job after appearing on a television cooking show. In another blow to the government, 36 senators were indicted last month for backing an &quot;unconstitutional&quot; bid to make the senate fully elected. The elephant in the room is the looming royal succession. Thailand&apos;s King Bhumibol is 86 and ailing, but strict lese-majesty laws make it impossible for journalists based in the country \u2013 including this one \u2013 to discuss the issue openly without fear of arrest. The crown prince is widely seen as an ally of Thaksin, and credible analysts view the current political turmoil through the lens of royal intrigue and a fight for control of the crown property bureau, which is worth billions. The army&apos;s intentions will become clearer in the next few days. Many government supporters fear that it will appoint a new administration, which the protesters have been clamouring for \u2013 despite doubts over whether the constitution allows it. If this happens, the red shirts will surely take to the streets again, and more bloodshed will be inevitable. Those of us who love Thailand and value democracy must stand with the country&apos;s flawed but democratically elected government. This does not mean supporting Thaksin, who has been described by Human Rights Watch as &quot;a human-rights abuser of the worst kind&quot;. It means allowing the Thai people to elect their own leaders \u2013 even bad ones \u2013 and control their own destiny.", "publicationDate": "2014-05-21T15:43:36Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Human rights", "Law"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/21/stand-up-thailand-fragile-democracy-civil-war", "title": "We must defend Thailand's fragile democracy \u2013\t or civil war looms | Mark Fenn", "sentences": ["Fourteen television stations have been taken off the air, and the Bangkok Post reported on Wednesday that the military was &quot;restricting comments on TV and in the print media by prohibiting remarks that could confuse society or provoke violence&quot;.", "The government commands strong support in the rural north and north-east of the country, while the protesters are drawn mainly from Bangkok&apos;s middle class and elite, and from opposition strongholds in the south."]}, {"article": "So how does Boublil and Sch\u00f6nberg&apos;s musical stand up 25 years after its premiere? In this new production by Laurence Connor, it survives very well as a piece of musical storytelling and as a public spectacle. It&apos;s not a show one loves, in the way one does Guys and Dolls or Sweeney Todd, but I found myself watching it with a professional admiration. It is famously derived from Madam Butterfly in that it shows, in the final days of the Vietnam war, the doomed love between an American marine, Chris, and an orphaned Saigon prostitute, Kim. But, in one crucial respect, the narrative improves on its source. In the opera, Pinkerton&apos;s abandonment of Cio-Cio-San strikes one as heartless. But, in this version, the lovers are separated by the enforced American evacuation of Saigon in 1975. And this leads to the musical&apos;s most famous scene of a helicopter whisking troops off the American embassy roof, something accomplished here with a technical skill that generates the kind of excitement one associates with 19th-century spectacular melodrama. But, seeing the show for the first time in a quarter of a century, I was more struck by its satirical edge than its emotional power. It&apos;s not just that Chris condemns the Vietnam war as &quot;a senseless fight&quot;. Connor&apos;s production implies that, although the story is about a cultural collision, the opposing forces of communism and capitalism carry strange visual echoes. Ho Chi Minh City, as Saigon became, is embodied by a towering golden statue before which Viet Cong troops parade with well-drilled fervour. America, meanwhile, is symbolised by a Statue of Liberty replica before which chorines dance with military precision. The show is not morally equating the two systems; it is simply suggesting that they feed off each other. The show&apos;s satirical quality is best embodied by the character of the Engineer: a pimping Pandarus, bred of a Vietnamese woman and a French soldier, he is caught between two worlds and dreams of escape to America. He was excellently played by Jonathan Pryce in the original, but here Jon Jon Briones makes him an even grubbier, sleazier figure who is the victim of both his background and pathetic fantasies that see him in the penultimate number, The American Dream, pleasuring himself on the bonnet of a Cadillac. The show&apos;s political point about the casualties of a disastrous war comes across clearly. If I was less moved by the love story, it was no fault of the actors but of the fact that Sch\u00f6nberg&apos;s score becomes generic and rhetorical in the big romantic numbers. They are, however, very well sung by Eva Noblezada as Kim and Alistair Brammer as Chris. Kwang-Ho-Hong also makes a very strong impression as Kim&apos;s rejected lover turned political commissar.  All told, the evening leaves one admiring the technical skill of Connor&apos;s production, the musical staging of Bob Avian and the designs of Totie Driver and Matt Kinley, which bring out especially well the gaudy vulgarity and neon sickness of Bangkok, where Kim ends up as an exploited showgirl. I can&apos;t say I was deeply moved, unlike the lady in front of me forever dabbing her eyes, but I came away feeling this is a successful variation on an old tale and put across with exemplary vigour. \u2022 Box office: 0844 482 5155.

They are still waiting. The imposition of military rule is only the latest in a series of rude interruptions of civilian government by the army, which has staged 18 coups since then, 11 of them successful. Civilian rule itself has been no democratic idyll, with some administrations managed from behind the scenes by the military, others chaotic coalitions, others still torn by clashes between wilful leaders of micro parties. The broad story of Thai politics over the years has been one in which the country&apos;s establishment \u2013 the bureaucracy, the judiciary, the royal court, the army, and the Bangkok middle class \u2013 has used the political system, including its default mechanism of the military coup, to play out their own quarrels and rivalries. This changed when Thaksin Shinawatra, a former policeman who had become a highly successful businessman, arrived on the political scene. He abandoned the Bangkok merry-go-round, instead challenging it by seeking and winning votes among the poorer classes, particularly in the north of the country, as well as among residents of the capital originally from the outer provinces. These were people whose attitude to those who had previously sought their support was summed up in the description of a politician as a baby bird. Each vote they gave him was like a feather; when he had enough feathers, he flew away, and they never saw him again. Thaksin was different. He delivered, changing lives with healthcare schemes, loan assistance and development funds. They voted for him gratefully and consistently, and when he went into exile, they voted for associates he nominated. When these were pushed out by various dirty tricks, they voted for his sister, recently also ousted on a legal technicality. There was much that was problematic about Thaksin and his family, but the fundamental fact was that the old establishment could not cope with the reversal of fortune which had taken place. They tried to change the verdict of the polls on the streets, paralysing the business of government by the threat of violence and provoking an answering violence from Thaksin supporters. The king was old and out of it, and there were no politicians with the seniority and moderation to mediate. That left the less than impartial army, whose sympathies lie with the establishment and which had intervened against Thaksin before,  in 2006.

General Prayuth Chan-ocha, head of the army and now acting prime minister, did not use the word &quot;coup&quot; in his televised announcement to the nation but declared the takeover was necessary &quot;in order for the country to return to normality quickly, and for society to love and be at peace again&quot;. He added: &quot;We ask the public not to panic and to carry on their lives normally.&quot; On Friday the general summoned members of the politically pivotal Shinawatra family to a meeting. Yingluck Shinawatra was forced from office as caretaker prime minister earlier in the month by a court ruling; her brother, Thaksin, was ousted as prime minister by the military in 2006 and opponents argue the family exercises a corrupt grip on Thai politics that must be broken.  The Reuters news agency said Yingluck Shinawatra and the general were seen arriving on Friday at an army facility, while the army announced it had banned 155 people including politicians and activists from leaving the country &quot;in order to maintain peace and resolve the conflict&quot;. The surprise announcement of a full military takeover followed the unexpected late-night invocation of martial law on Tuesday, which the army said was not a coup but merely a peacekeeping move to &quot;restore order&quot; in a nation beleaguered by political in-fighting. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, in a strongly worded statement warning that the takeover would &quot;have negative implications for the US-Thai relationship&quot;, openly condemned Prayuth&apos;s move and said: &quot;There is no justification for this military coup.&quot; He added: &quot;I urge the restoration of civilian government immediately, a return to democracy, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as press freedoms. The path forward for Thailand must include early elections that reflect the will of the people.&quot; Bangkok&apos;s road traffic increased Thursday evening after the military announced a nationwide 10pm-5am curfew. Many people stocked up on essentials at supermarkets and small shops. The army also banned public gatherings of five or more people, suspended all television and radio stations (which are permitted to play only military signals), and established a special unit to monitor social media comment. Rival political factions have spent the past two days at Bangkok&apos;s Army Club, where they attempted to come to a compromise over the future of the country. The coup became apparent during Thursday&apos;s negotiations when Prayuth asked the caretaker justice minister, Chaikasem Nitisiri, whether the government was ready to resign. &quot;As of this minute, the government will not resign,&quot; Chaikasem allegedly answered, according to the English-language Nation newspaper. &quot;So, as of this minute, I decide to seize ruling power,&quot; Prayuth retorted. An electoral commissioner who was at the negotiations said that Prayuth had told the assembled company: &quot;Everyone must sit still.&quot; Rumours of a possible coup had been circulating since November, when anti-government protesters first took to the streets to demand the resignation of the incumbent Pheu Thai party. But Prayuth&apos;s seemingly sudden decision on Thursday \u2013 in the midst of negotiations between rival political groups \u2013 took many by surprise. &quot;The army clearly had no sincerity in brokering talks,&quot; said Michael Connors, a south-east Asia expert and associate professor at the Malaysia campus of the University of Notthingham. &quot;In retrospect [the coup] must have been calculated, and it looks like the [declaration of] martial law was just a pretext to deliver a strategic advantage to the coup group.&quot; Despite options reportedly being floated at the Prayuth-mediated talks at the Army Club no agreement was reached, although the rival leaders did tweet &quot;selfie&quot; pictures of themselves smiling and laughing together at the round-table discussions. All that changed, however, when hundreds of extra troops arrived at the venue and took away the leader of the anti-government protests, Suthep Thaugsuban. Various other leaders have also been detained, including members of the opposition party, of the Pheu Thai government, plus members of the pro-government Red Shirts and anti-government People&apos;s Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC). Thailand&apos;s caretaker prime minister, Niwutthamrong Boonsongpaisan, who assumed the role this month after Yingluck Shinawatra was removed from office by a controversial court ruling, was not at the meeting on Thursday and his location was unknown. Rumours that he could have been at the US embassy were denied publicly, and the army asked him to turn himself in. Prayuth had warned he wanted an end to the political warring that, since November, as anti-government protesters begancalling for a new, appointed, government, has led to the deaths of 28 people and caused injury to more than 700 others. &quot;This must be resolved swiftly before I retire, otherwise I won&apos;t retire,&quot; said Prayuth, who is due to step down at the end of September. &quot;I will not allow Thailand to be like Ukraine or Egypt.&quot; The new Peace and Order Maintaining Command, which includes the army, navy and police, will now be in charge of governingthe country. The stated aim is to reform Thailand&apos;s economic, political and social structures, Prayuth said, though courts and parliament&apos;s upper house will continue as normal. Chiranuch Premchaiporn, press freedom advocate of the online news outlet Prachatai, told the Associated Press: &quot;Our problems will never be solved if people are not allowed to express their ideas and speak.&quot; The takeover was met with a warning by the Red Shirt activists&apos; group, the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), which vowed retaliationshortly after the televised statement. &quot;NOW it is COUP \u2013 stand by for a retaliation from the UDD,&quot; the group tweeted. Various governments, including those of France and Germany, as well as human rights groups, have condemned the military&apos;s move \u2013 the 19th coup since absolute monarchy was abolished here in 1932. &quot;The military&apos;s seizure of power has become routine and a sad reality of Thai politics,&quot; said Karim Lahidji, of the International Federation for Human Rights. &quot;Two days after it publicly declared that it was not going to stage a coup, the military seized power and plunged Thailand into a deeper political crisis.&quot; The junta warned it would block any social media platforms in the country found to carry content that incited violence or criticised military leaders. In a television bulletin the military urged &quot;co-operation from social media operators and all involved to stop such messages that incite violence, break the law or criticise the coup council&quot;. &quot;If we find any to be in violation we will suspend the service immediately and will summon those responsible for prosecution.&quot; Observers say Thailand&apos;s next move will depend on just how well the various factions, and the public, respond to the military takeover. &quot;This coup looks like many others going back to the 1970s: the language used, the seeming solidarity among the main branches of the security forces,&quot; said Michael Montesano, co-coordinator of the Thailand studies programme at Singapore&apos;s institute of south-east Asian studies. &quot;They&apos;ve inherited a mess and how they&apos;re going to manage it depends on how much resistance there is to the government that they attempt to install.&quot; Connors said, though, that the fact that there had been so much talk of resistance proved this coup was different from all the others. &quot;They&apos;ve never had a coup like this, in which this potential of mass resistance is so strong,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s only imaginable that this coup will be incredibly repressive as a response.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-05-23T05:44:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/22/military-coup-thailand-peace-general-prayuth-chan-ocha", "title": "Coup needed for Thailand 'to love and be at peace again' - army chief", "sentences": ["The path forward for Thailand must include early elections that reflect the will of the people.&quot; Bangkok&apos;s road traffic increased Thursday evening after the military announced a nationwide 10pm-5am curfew.", "Rival political factions have spent the past two days at Bangkok&apos;s Army Club, where they attempted to come to a compromise over the future of the country."]}, {"article": "Thailand&apos;s military has detained more than 150 politicians and activists and banned them from leaving the country, a day after the army chief seized power in a coup declared necessary to &quot;restore order and normality&quot; in the politically divided nation. The group includes members of the prominent Shinawatra family, including former premier Yingluck Shinawatra, who was forced to step down two weeks ago. Those disobeying the army&apos;s summons were warned that they would be arrested and prosecuted, the army&apos;s new governing body, the National Peace and Order Maintenance Council (NPOMC), said. Yingluck arrived at the Royal Thai Army base on Friday morning in a bulletproof vehicle surrounded by bodyguards, local media reported, but left after 30 minutes for another army facility, according to the Associated Press. It was unclear what the army&apos;s summons entailed, as media were not allowed inside the base and reporting has been highly restricted, with many Thai and international TV channels off-air. Some were later released but by Friday evening, the whereabouts of those still in detention remained unclear. Thaksin&apos;s lawyer, Robert Amsterdam, issued a statement warning that the &quot;illegal seizure of power&quot; could result in a power divide. &quot;The military coup carried out by the army of Thailand does not have any legitimacy, nor does the army of Thailand have a mandate from the people of Thailand to govern the country,&quot; Amsterdam said. &quot;Those who have the mandate of the people of Thailand, secured through free and fair elections, are now considering the formation of a government in exile.&quot; The chief of the army,General Prayuth Chan-ocha, who staged Thursday&apos;s coup and is acting prime minister, also summoned a number of other high-ranking anti- and pro-government leaders for talks, among them the recently deposed premier Niwatthamrong Boonsongpaisan, as well as former labour minister Chalerm Yubamrung. Foreign ambassadors were also invited to meet with the new NPOMC at 4pm local time. The detention of such a large number of politicians and leaders is significant, not least because it involves the Shinawatra clan \u2013 a highly polarising family in Thailand. The 64-year-old leader of the group, Thaksin \u2013 a telecoms tycoon and former prime minister who was deposed in a 2006 military coup \u2013 was hugely popular among rural voters and lauded for his populist policies while in office. But he was equally derided by Bangkok&apos;s urban, pro-royalist elites, who accused the politician of cronyism and corruption. Despite having been deposed eight years ago, Thaksin is still at the forefront of the political turmoil, during which 28 people have been killed and 700 injured since November \u2013 when protests against the Yingluck-led Pheu Thai party were sparked by a proposed amnesty bill that would have ushered in Thaksin&apos;s return to Thailand. The government has since been in a political deadlock, with anti-Thaksin forces fighting for the installation of a non-appointed leader who would oversee vague reforms, and pro-Thaksin forces calling for elections. Pro-Thaksin parties have won every election since 2001. Now the army is at the helm and has promised not only to restore order but also institute the reforms \u2013 although just how, and under what circumstances, has not yet been made clear. On Friday evening, hundreds of protesters held a candlelit vigil in downtown Bangkok with banners reading &quot;No coup!&quot;, &quot;Let people vote&quot; and &quot;Military junta \u2013 get out!&quot;. A large group of soldiers initially attempted to disperse the crowd, before allowing them to hold the sit-in at the central MBK shopping centre, local media reported. Earlier, unverified reports circulated that the military was attempting to detain pro-Thaksin redshirts in the north and north-east of the country. According to online news portal Khaosod, the army has also closed off a Thai-Laos border crossing in an effort to prevent them from fleeing the country. Like Thaksin, army chief Prayuth is no stranger to coups: he was part of the junta that helped depose Thaksin in 2006, a takeover that helped cement a massive pro-Thaksin support base known as the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship, and eventually led to massive street battles between royalist yellowshirts and pro-Thaksin supporters in 2010, resulting in the deaths of nearly 100 people. While Prayuth claimed that the takeover would help restore peace to the nation, &quot;it&apos;s the very act of a military takeover that is likely to\u00a0\u2026 provoke acts of violence and possibly cause more loss of life&quot;, said the Bangkok Post in an editorial on Friday. &quot;This coup is not the solution.&quot; Thursday&apos;s coup \u2013 the country&apos;s 19th since an absolute monarchy was abolished here in 1932 \u2013 has been condemned by a number of nations, including France, Japan, Australia, the EU, UN and US.

She had been so house-proud that it broke his heart to see the windows smashed and footmarks all over her immaculate worktops. &quot;I felt that everything in my parents&apos; world had been defiled. But one positive thing came out of it. The burglars had ripped open Dad&apos;s beautiful old desk, which he had kept locked for as long as I can remember. And as I sorted through it, I spotted an old diary, dating back to 1944. For the first time, I had his own record of his wartime experiences.&quot; Tarrant had always enjoyed a special bond with his father, Basil. &quot;Dad was my closest friend,&quot; he says. &quot;We had a similar outlook and I could talk to him about anything. Sex, relationships \u2026 whatever.&quot; He looks a little sad. &quot;The only thing that was taboo was the war. It was a generational thing. The ones like Dad, who had been in the thick of the fighting, rarely said a word about it. From childhood, I knew better than to ask. But after he died, I realised I barely knew him at all.&quot; Tarrant, 67, is chatting at his publishers in London. Dressed in a sober suit, he seems less blokey than of old and more reflective, though that&apos;s hardly surprising. Last month, on a flight from Bangkok to London, he suffered a\u00a0mini-stroke and nearly died. Thanks to intensive physiotherapy, his speech and movement are almost fully restored, though his specialist has warned him that his piano-playing days are over. &quot;But that&apos;s OK,&quot; he quips. &quot;I couldn&apos;t play the piano in the first place. The main thing is I&apos;ve lost a stone and a half in weight. And I\u00a0get tired. But it&apos;s a lesson learned. I&apos;m\u00a0taking three months off and then\u00a0I&apos;ll decide what to do. Will I go back into television? I don&apos;t know.&quot; One thing is certain, however. If his father were alive, he would be among the first he&apos;d turn to for advice. He is never far from his thoughts. Now more so than ever because he has spent the past two years writing a deeply moving memoir about the mysterious war record of his father, who won a Military Cross that was personally authorised by Field Marshall Montgomery. It was an extraordinary experience, wading through mountains of regimental paperwork and, above all, speaking to the surviving men who had served with his father \u2013 men now in their 90s. The revelations astonished him. Basil joined a territorial unit of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps in 1936 when he was just 17. He was called up in 1939 and went with his unit to France, but was evacuated from Dunkirk in the chaotic retreat in May 1940. But on 6 June, 1944, he was back for D-Day and landed on Juno Beach. As an officer, he was one of the first ashore, encountering ferocious resistance, but characteristically Basil always made light of D-Day. &quot;He used to say, &apos;It was all right when we landed, there was just a bit of struggle with the\u00a0parking.&apos;&quot;     \u2018He was always in the thick of everything\u2019 \u2026 Chris Tarrant's father, Basil.     After Normandy, Basil won the MC for leading a night patrol of 16 men through a minefield at Groesbeek on the Dutch-German border, where they attacked two farm buildings housing 60 Germans. Although heavily outnumbered, they flushed out the enemy with grenades, receiving no casualties, before continuing the advance, where the battalion engaged repeatedly with retreating Panzer units. But perhaps his finest hour came when they pushed on to the German town of Kleve and the scene of Operation Veritable, when, in six weeks, 25,000 Allied and 80,000 German soldiers died. With his senior officers dead, Basil had to take command. &quot;Few of us have heard of the battle, but it was one of the most savage of the whole war,&quot; says Tarrant. &quot;It would have been house-to-house, and hand-to-hand, and bayonets.&quot; For his bravery and initiative, his father was recommended for a second Military Cross, but the order was either never received or overruled. &quot;The more I&apos;ve learned about what he did, the more it rankles,&quot; says Tarrant. Basil&apos;s war ended three weeks before peace was declared when his Jeep drove over an anti-tank mine. It was thought he would lose an arm, but surgeons managed to save it. The miracle is he survived the war. Time and again, Basil overcame seemingly insurmountable odds. &quot;He must have learned very quickly how to survive, using a street fighter&apos;s intelligence. He also had a lot of luck. He would have seen so many people shot or horrifically wounded.&quot; Listening to the men who served under his father, Tarrant found it hard to equate Basil&apos;s heroic and expedient \u2013 but nonetheless bloody \u2013 actions with the laidback, funny man he knew. &quot;They all said if they had to crawl through a house full of Germans they would rather follow Major Tarrant than anyone else because they thought they had half a chance of coming home. I kept saying, &apos;You&apos;re just saying that because I&apos;m his son,&apos; but they said, &apos;No, we really liked him. He played football with us. Even though he was an officer, we related to him.&apos; &quot;Mind you, one chap thought Dad was slightly mad. As they lay behind a wall being picked off by sniper fire, Dad briefly showed his head so they could locate the firing position. The plan worked and they took the sniper out immediately, but they were convinced Dad had been killed. This guy said it was as if Dad had something to prove. He was always in the thick of everything.&quot; Tarrant is immensely proud of his father, but hurt that he felt unable to share his war experiences with him. &quot;I&apos;m sure people will ask why I didn&apos;t press harder, but you can&apos;t force someone to relive painful memories. He used to go to soldiers&apos; reunions and I\u00a0reckon that would have been the one time he talked about it.&quot; He also did something he regrets. &quot;I\u00a0set up my own production company and Dad unexpectedly said, &apos;I&apos;ve got an idea for a programme. We could go to Juno Beach, talk about D-Day and the film could go out on 6 June for the 50th anniversary.&apos; I agreed it was a great idea, but there was no way we could make it in time. How stupid was I? Even if the film had never been publicly aired, I should have seized the offer with both hands.

I say, &apos;Dad, I found this out yesterday \u2013 why didn&apos;t you tell me?&apos; But I always end by saying, &apos;I&apos;ve learned so much more respect, admiration and love for you.&apos; &quot;When Dad fell ill with heart trouble, we didn&apos;t think he was dying because he was tough. But I think he knew because on Armistice Day he struggled out of bed, put on his best suit and medals, and stood to attention in front of the television through the two minutes silence and saluted. &quot;When they played the Last Post, tears were streaming down his face.

The round-up of figures from the country&apos;s months of political turmoil continued a day after Thailand&apos;s army chief seized power in a coup declared necessary to &quot;restore order and normality&quot;. On Friday General Prayuth Chan-ocha, Thailand&apos;s acting premier, ordered 155 political leaders, including the Shinawatra clan and both pro- and anti-government protesters, to report to him at Thai army headquarters in Bangkok. A further 35 activists and leaders were additionally summoned on Saturday \u2014 including prominent academics \u2014 under threat of a two-year jail sentence and 40,000 baht ($1,230) fine if they failed to turn themselves in. Military spokesman Colonel Werachon Sukhondhadhpatipak told the BBC the purpose was to give the detainees \u201ctime to think\u201d and \u201cfind common ground\u201d regarding their political differences. While some have been released the whereabouts of many remains unknown. They have all been banned from leaving the country. Local media reported on Friday that Yingluck had been taken to an army camp in Saraburi province, central Thailand, but a military aide would not confirm the location. \u201cShe\u2019s in a safe place,\u201d the aide told Reuters. \u201cShe has not been detained in any military camp. That\u2019s all I can say at the moment.\u201d A source from Yingluck\u2019s Pheu Thai party said: \u201cWe can\u2019t say she is absolutely free because there are soldiers in the area monitoring her.\u201d Yingluck\u2019s sister and brother-in-law \u2014 both of whom have also held senior political posts \u2014 were being detained, as are several former ministers in the now-deposed Pheu Thai government. It is believed that they were all moved to different locations around the country to minimise the potential for any resistance to Thursday&apos;s military coup. Yingluck had arrived at a Bangkok base on Friday morning in a bulletproof vehicle surrounded by bodyguards, local media reported, but left after 30 minutes for another army facility, according to the Associated Press. Friday&apos;s detention of such a large number of politicians and leaders is significant, not least because it involves the Shinawatra clan \u2013 a highly polarising family in Thailand. The 64-year-old leader of the family, Thaksin \u2013 a telecoms tycoon and former prime minister who was deposed in a 2006 military coup \u2013 was hugely popular among rural voters and lauded for his populist policies while in office. But he was equally derided by Bangkok&apos;s urban pro-royalist elites who accused him of cronyism and corruption. Despite being deposed eight years ago Thaksin is the catalyst for the political turmoil that has seen 28 people killed and 700 injured since November, when protests against the Yingluck-led Pheu Thai party were sparked by a proposed amnesty bill that would have ushered in Thaksin&apos;s return to Thailand. The government has since been in a political deadlock, with anti-Thaksin forces fighting for the installation of a non-appointed leader who would oversee vague reforms, and pro-Thaksin forces calling for elections. Pro-Thaksin parties have won every election since 2001. Now the army is at the helm and has promised to not only restore order but to institute the reforms. Just how, and under what circumstances, has not yet been made clear. Thaksin&apos;s lawyer, Robert Amsterdam, issued a statement on Friday warning that the army&apos;s &quot;illegal seizure of power&quot; could result in a dramatic power divide. &quot;The military coup carried out by the army of Thailand does not have any legitimacy nor does the army of Thailand have a mandate from the people of Thailand to govern the country,&quot; Amsterdam said. &quot;Those who have the mandate of the people of Thailand, secured through free and fair elections, are now considering the formation of a government in exile.&quot; The coup has provoked a growing public resistance to the military takeover amid bans of public gatherings of five or more people. On Saturday morning roughly 100 people gathered at a mall in northern Bangkok with signs reading \u201cFuck the coup\u201d and shouting \u201cElection, election!\u201d. They seemingly intended to march towards Thai army headquarters but were blockaded by soldiers in riot gear and army vans. The defiance on the streets followed another gathering of protesters Friday evening, with as many as five people believed to have been detained by the military for participating in a candlelit vigil, according to reports on Twitter.  Thursday&apos;s coup \u2013the country&apos;s 19th since an absolute monarchy was abolished in 1932 \u2013 has been condemned by human rights group and nations including France, Japan, Australia, Germany, the EU, UN and US. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, said there was no justification for the coup and called for the release of all detained politicians. The US has since suspended $3.5m in military aid to Thailand, roughly one-third of its aid to the country. Unverified reports circulated that the military was attempting to detain &quot;red shirts&quot; \u2013 supporters of Thaksin \u2013 in the north and north-east of the country. According to online news portal Khaosod the army has also closed off a Thailand-Laos border crossing in an attempt to prevent them fleeing across. Like Thaksin, army chief Prayuth is no stranger to coups: he was part of the junta that helped depose Thaksin, a takeover that helped cement a massive pro-Thaksin support base known as the United Front for Democracy and eventually led to massive street battles between royalist yellow shirts and Thaksin supporters in 2010 that resulted in the deaths of nearly 100 people. Prayuth claimed that the takeover would help restore peace to the nation but the Bangkok Post said in an editorial on Friday: &quot;It&apos;s the very act of a military takeover that is likely to \u2026 provoke acts of violence and possibly cause more loss of life. This coup is not the solution.&quot; Most analysts have said the situation in Thailand is unlikely to improve soon. &quot;The &apos;hardliner&apos; generals now run the show and we should expect [a] bad outcome,&quot; said a report by the Siam Intelligence Unit thinktank. &quot;The new junta government will run the country for one to two years. The worst possible scenario is a chronic civil war.&quot; The new military administration has issued an order banning all media from reporting information deemed a threat to national security; a criticism of the acting government; or news that could incite confusion, conflict or unrest, according to online news portal Prachatai.", "publicationDate": "2014-05-24T07:21:08Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/24/thailand-coup-yingluck-detained-as-roundup-by-military-continues", "title": "Thailand coup: Yingluck detained as roundup by military continues", "sentences": ["On Friday General Prayuth Chan-ocha, Thailand&apos;s acting premier, ordered 155 political leaders, including the Shinawatra clan and both pro- and anti-government protesters, to report to him at Thai army headquarters in Bangkok.", "Yingluck had arrived at a Bangkok base on Friday morning in a bulletproof vehicle surrounded by bodyguards, local media reported, but left after 30 minutes for another army facility, according to the Associated Press.", "But he was equally derided by Bangkok&apos;s urban pro-royalist elites who accused him of cronyism and corruption.", "On Saturday morning roughly 100 people gathered at a mall in northern Bangkok with signs reading \u201cFuck the coup\u201d and shouting \u201cElection, election!\u201d.", "Prayuth claimed that the takeover would help restore peace to the nation but the Bangkok Post said in an editorial on Friday: &quot;It&apos;s the very act of a military takeover that is likely to \u2026 provoke acts of violence and possibly cause more loss of life."]}, {"article": "     Thailand&apos;s military junta has dissolved the country&apos;s last remaining democratic institution \u2013 the senate \u2013 and ordered dozens of activists and journalists to turn themselves in to the army as protests grow against Thursday&apos;s coup. The governing National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) announced in a televised statement late on Saturday that it had dissolved the senate and would be assuming control of all lawmaking powers, a few hours after it summoned 35 prominent academics and activists to report to army headquarters. That was in addition to some 155 leading politicians and leaders it had already called in for questioning. The council has also sacked the police chief and head of the department of special investigations, Thailand&apos;s FBI, and on Sunday afternoon it called in the editors of 18 major Thai newspapers.

Thailand&apos;s army seized power in what it said was an effort to restore peace and order after six months of political infighting left 28 people dead and more than 700 injured. But the coup leaders are also facing trouble in southern Thailand, where at least 10 bombs exploded on Saturday, reportedly killing three people and wounding 63. An Islamic insurgency has been under way in the south for a decade. Troops were deployed across central Bangkok on Sunday, concentrated around the shopping malls of Rajprasong, to dispel a growing crowd of protesters defying a public ban on gatherings of five or more people. The crowd shouted at the soldiers, held up banners reading &quot;anti coup&quot; and called for elections and a return to democratic rule.     Soldiers stand guard in Bangkok after dispersing anti-coup protesters on Sunday. Photograph: Christophe Archambault/AFP/Getty Images    About 1,000 people gathered for a similar protest on Saturday in Bangkok, where some were reportedly arrested, while others protested against the coup in the northern city of Chiang Mai, a political stronghold for the now-deposed Pheu Thai party. Demonstrations also took place at the beach resort of Pattaya and at Khon Kaen in the north-east. The army chief and head of the junta, General Prayuth Chan-ocha, now serving as acting prime minister, warned people against joining the protests: &quot;Democratic principles cannot be executed normally,&quot; he said. On Thursday, Prayuth dissolved the lower house of parliament and suspended the constitution, one that he had previously helped draw up in 2006 when he was part of the last military coup that deposed Thaksin Shinawatra as prime minister. Emptying out both the house and senate means the junta will bypass the need for parliamentary approval of new laws. Many of those told to report to the junta appear to been outwardly critical of Thailand&apos;s lese-majeste law, known as Article 112, which calls for up to 15 years&apos; imprisonment for defamatory, insulting or threatening comments about the royal family. Critics claim it stifles public debate and helps to maintain the status quo. Recent attempts to reform the law have been met with fervent resistance by royalists, among them Prayuth, who according to the Associated Press told critics: &quot;If you guys play hardball I&apos;ll have no choice but to do so too.&quot; After initially blocking all Thai and foreign television channels from broadcasting, the junta has allowed some to go back on the air. But it appears that many international channels \u2013 among them CNN and BBC \u2013 are still blocked. About 14 Thai TV channels and radio stations were still banned, the Bangkok Post reported. Chambers said the speed at which the junta was instituting change was &quot;very worrisome&quot; and that the immediate future for Thailand looked bleak. &quot;I see more jailings. I see the enshrinement of more army power. I see the beginning of civil war after Thaksin announces a government in exile,&quot; he said. A number of nations and human rights organisations have expressed their grave concern over the military&apos;s recent actions. The US, a major trading partner, has suspended $3.5m (\u00a32m) in military aid. &quot;We are increasingly concerned about actions the military has taken, just a few days after it staged a coup \u2026 We again call on the military to release those detained for political reasons, end restrictions on the media and move to restore civilian rule and democracy through elections,&quot; a state department spokeswoman said on Saturday.

King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 86, who is ailing and frail, is not expected to attend the a royal ceremony on Monday morning at the Royal Thai Army headquarters in Bangkok.

Former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra, had been taken into custody on Thursday but was released on Saturday.

The Shinawatra clan is a polarising family in Thailand. Its billionaire leader, Thaksin, a former premier deposed in 2006, now lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai. His supporters have fought bloodily with his critics for eight years and some observers say that the current military detentions could be seen as an attempt to &quot;purge&quot; the nation of any Shinawatra influence.

General Prayuth Chan-ocha told journalists on Monday morning that the much revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 86, had officially backed him as the leader of the military council now running the country. Prayuth seized power on Thursday after six months of political in-fighting between the now-deposed government and its critics, who had taken to the streets and besieged government buildings in an effort to oust it. At least 28 people were killed and more than 700 injured in sometimes violent clashes after anti-government protests began in November. Vowing to restore order across Thailand, Prayuth said he would have no choice but to use violence if anti-coup demonstrators, who over the past four days have taken to the streets in Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Pattaya, continued to protest. &quot;The most important thing right now is to keep peace and order in the country,&quot; said Prayuth, dressed in a white military uniform and flanked by 14 officers, in the televised press conference. &quot;The less you allow me to speak, the more I&apos;ll be able to work.&quot; The royal endorsement officially allows Prayuth to head the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), which will establish a legislative assembly and reform committee, draw up a temporary constitution, and appoint a prime minister. Prayuth promised elections would take place, but only when Thailand was &quot;at peace&quot;. One of the council&apos;s first actions will be to arrange payments to nearly 1 million farmers under a botched billion-dollar rice-pledging scheme initiated by the now-deposed Pheu Thai government. Prayuth has enacted sweeping changes in the four days since he deposed the democratically elected government. More than 200 journalists, academics, politicians and activists have been rounded up and many of them detained in undisclosed locations, ostensibly to give them &quot;time to think&quot;, as Prayuth said last week. Although the army has said detentions will last no longer than a week, observers fear they are merely a means to stifle dissent against the takeover, because many of those summoned include members of the former cabinet, including the former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra and her supporters, and those who appear to have been outwardly critical of Thailand&apos;s lese-majesty law, which protects the monarchy. As of Monday, an unknown number of people still remained in detention, including the outspoken Thai journalist Pravit Rojanaphruk of the English-language newspaper the Nation, who has not been seen or heard from since arriving at army headquarters on Sunday, the newspaper reported. Yingluck was released from detention late on Sunday but now has soldiers guarding her home and must inform the junta of her activities, a senior military official told Reuters. Suthep Thaugsuban, who has led anti-government protests for the past six months, has also been released from detention but was handed over on Monday to the prosecutor&apos;s office on rebellion charges, along with 10 other leaders of the People&apos;s Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC), the Nation reported. Another nine people \u2013 among them law and political science professors from Bangkok universities \u2013 were summoned late on Sunday night, the online news portal Prachathai reported, with some pro-government leaders and anti-coup protesters having been arrested in the northern city of Chiang Mai over the weekend. The junta has said that the military now has the jurisdiction to intervene in all legal cases \u2013 including lese-majesty and national security cases \u2013 and has warned civilians and the media against posting anything on social media that could be deemed a threat to national security. &quot;For those of you who use social media to provoke, please stop because it&apos;s not good for anyone,&quot; the deputy army spokesman, Winthai Suvaree, said in a televised statement. Nineteen news editors were called in on Sunday for the junta to speak to them about covering news during an &quot;abnormal situation&quot;, the Nation reported. Various human rights groups and countries have expressed their concern over the coup \u2013 among them the US, the EU, Japan, France and Germany \u2013 and issued warnings against &quot;non-essential travel&quot; to the popular tourist destination. The US has suspended roughly one-third of its aid to the country. The former education minister Chaturon Chaisang, who is currently in hiding, told Reuters by telephone that the junta was likely to tighten its grip as the days wore on. &quot;This is very serious indeed, it&apos;s very bad,&quot; Chaturon said. &quot;It seems they&apos;ll detain a lot of people and we don&apos;t know for how long.

This has to be one of the best novels in recent years, and I&apos;m looking forward to exploring other works by this writer, I can&apos;t believe I have missed out. Digressive, challenging, psychologically and formally challenging.  edinflo was entranced by Rebecca Solnit&apos;s The Faraway Nearby, the account of a daughter coping with her mother&apos;s Alzheimer&apos;s:   It is a collection of intertwined essays about the decline of her mother, who has dementia, and Solnit&apos;s ambivalence as she contemplates the fraught and competitive relationship they had for most of her life. She uses this framework to explores larger ideas about stories, selfhood, memory and myth. I really liked her thoughts on reading and the relationship between reader, book and writer:   The object we call a book is not the real book, but its potential, like a musical score or seed. It exists fully only in the act of being read; and its real home is inside the head of the reader, where the symphony resounds, the seed germinates. A book is a heart that only beats in the chest of another.

The way a wall of books can be at once a wonderful homely thing and a dominating unmovable feature and sabotages any attempt at redecoration, frightens off potential buyers, and , in the end, a dead weight that prevents their owner from moving on.   TimHannigan shared his thoughts on a new &quot;genre&quot; he has encountered:  There is a peculiar phenomenon in English-language publishing in Southeast Asia: a ubiquitous genre perhaps best thought of as \u201cAsian sleaze\u201d. It spans fiction and non-fiction, but the cover generally features a partially clothed woman with long black hair, either in silhouette, or viewed from behind. The title is usually something along the lines of Bangkok Velvet. The author is always a white man. Whether the book is fictional or purportedly \u201ctrue\u201d, it invariably features a cast of bargirls, whose portrayal is not exactly three-dimensional. It also invariably features a number of white men. If the book is nonfiction the principal white man is the author. If the book is fiction the principal white man is, well, the author (but usually dressed up as a hard-bitten private eye working in Bangkok). These principal white men do not appear to have much self-awareness. Seriously: next time you\u2019re passing through Singapore, Bangkok or Jakarta have a look in the airport bookshop. You\u2019ll see them.

The former education minister Chaturon Chaisaeng emerged from hiding on Tuesday to hold a surprise press conference at the Foreign Correspondents&apos; Club in Bangkok, where he told a room packed with journalists that he did not accept the coup and demanded that the country be returned to civilian rule. &quot;The coup d&apos;etat is not a solution to the problems or conflicts in Thai society but will make the conflicts even worse,&quot; Chaturon said. &quot;I still insist on using my own rights and liberty to call for returning the country to democracy.&quot; Thailand&apos;s army deposed the government last Thursday and has since stifled the media, enforced a nationwide curfew and detained roughly 250 people, among them activists, academics, journalists and politicians perceived to be critical of the regime. Many members of the ousted government are still in detention, having answered a military summons that Chaturon had been defying since last week. He was the first minister to speak publicly since the takeover, and said the coup was likely to create &quot;more and more resistance&quot;. Armed guards rushed into the press conference while Chaturon was speaking and escorted him to a van waiting outside. It is unclear what awaits those taken into custody, but reports suggest detainees can be held for up to seven days in undisclosed locations around the country, where they are denied contact with family or lawyers and have their personal belongings confiscated. General Prayuth Chan-ocha, the army chief who seized power last Thursday and is now acting as premier, has said the detentions are intended to give people &quot;time to think&quot;. &quot;I&apos;m not afraid,&quot; Chaturon said as he was being taken away. &quot;If I was afraid, I wouldn&apos;t be here.&quot; The junta spokesman Colonel Winthai Suvaree said Chaturon would face a military court for defying the summons, which could result in a two-year jail sentence and 40,000 baht (\u00a31,230) fine. Some observers expressed disbelief that the junta \u2013 which has barred any criticism of its new council and vowed to clamp down on reports that could incite unrest or &quot;cause confusion&quot; \u2013 would choose to arrest the politician in front of so many international media and risk attracting bad press. But the governing National Council for Peace and Order told the Bangkok Post that it was confident it could &quot;convince foreign correspondents that the action taken against Mr Chaturon was lawful and justified&quot;. Meanwhile, the online news portal Prachathai reported that the military had summoned for questioning 11 student activists from north-east Thailand, a political stronghold for the now deposed Pheu Thai government. There have been reports that university rectors and professors have been called in to discuss &quot;political activism&quot;. The United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship said at least 30 red shirt leaders \u2014 who also support Pheu Thai \u2014 had been detained. Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a political analyst at Kyoto University&apos;s Centre for Southeast Asian Studies, said the increasing number of military detentions could only be seen as an &quot;aggressive approach to intimidate people and create a climate of fear&quot;. &quot;By releasing so many orders, by calling people in, harassing them, detaining them, not telling them when you will set them free \u2013 it freaks people out and it is so effective,&quot; said Pavin, who is defying a summons to report to the military. But he added: &quot;It is very unwise to do this in front of the international community, when you know they are watching you closely. They just want to prove that they are really serious about people who mess with the military coup. This says: Don&apos;t mess with us. They want to publicise that [fact].&quot; Prayuth seized power last week in an attempt to &quot;restore peace and order&quot; after six months of political infighting and protests in which 28 people were killed and more than 700 injured. Critics have said the coup \u2013 Thailand&apos;s 19th in 82 years \u2013 is unlikely to heal deep political divisions, and anti-coup protests have popped up in Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Pattaya in the past few days. The junta has said the army would have no choice but to use force if the protests continue. Various governments and human rights groups have voiced their concern over the military takeover, while the US has frozen $3.5m worth of military aid. Tourism has dropped by 20%. Still, Thailand&apos;s navy chief, Admiral Narong Pipatanasai, offered a rosy outlook of the situation and said things were better than they seemed. &quot;The fact is,&quot; he said, &quot;we still live happily \u2013 more happily \u2013 than the period before we announced martial law.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-05-27T15:45:23Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/27/thai-minister-arrested-military-coup", "title": "Thai minister arrested at packed press conference after denouncing coup", "sentences": ["The former education minister Chaturon Chaisaeng emerged from hiding on Tuesday to hold a surprise press conference at the Foreign Correspondents&apos; Club in Bangkok, where he told a room packed with journalists that he did not accept the coup and demanded that the country be returned to civilian rule.", "But the governing National Council for Peace and Order told the Bangkok Post that it was confident it could &quot;convince foreign correspondents that the action taken against Mr Chaturon was lawful and justified&quot;.", "Critics have said the coup \u2013 Thailand&apos;s 19th in 82 years \u2013 is unlikely to heal deep political divisions, and anti-coup protests have popped up in Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Pattaya in the past few days."]}, {"article": "In what seems to be a move towards establishing some sense of normality nearly a week after staging a coup, Thailand&apos;s military junta has appointed an advisory council, released some high-profile activists from detention and relaxed a nationwide curfew.Observers called the news &quot;a small step in the right direction&quot; after last Thursday&apos;s military takeover \u2013 Thailand&apos;s second coup in eight years \u2013 which has resulted in widespread international criticism, the freezing of foreign aid, dwindling tourism and small but significant street protests calling for a return to democratic rule. But in a worrying step towards greater censorship, the junta announced on Wednesday that it would establish a &quot;national internet gateway&quot; to better monitor websites and social media platforms, and told local media it would be requesting Facebook, YouTube and the chat application Line to ban user accounts with &quot;illegal&quot; content, the news portal Prachatai reported. The junta has blocked 200 websites and also appeared to block 30 million users from Facebook for a brief period on Wednesday afternoon, but it was not clear if this was due to a technical glitch, as it claimed, or part of a wider censorship test. The military later reversed its &quot;technical glitch&quot; statement and said that it had blocked Facebook because people were using it to help organise protests. &quot;We have blocked Facebook temporarily and tomorrow we will call a meeting with other social media, like Twitter and Instagram, to ask for cooperation from them,&quot; Surachai Srisaracam, permanent secretary of the information and communications technology ministry, told Reuters. Led by the army chief General Prayuth Chan-ocha, who seized control after six months of political instability, the junta has enacted rapid changes in a matter of days, among them the detention of over 250 journalists, academics, activists and politicians; the dismantling of many media freedoms; and a ban on public gatherings of more than five people in order to prevent anti-coup protests. Having been endorsed on Monday by Thailand&apos;s king, Prayuth&apos;s first task has been to revive Thailand&apos;s spluttering economy. It has begun making payments for roughly one million farmers under the now deposed government&apos;s botched rice subsidy scheme, and late on Tuesday named a six-member team of advisers \u2013 among them retired generals with strong connections to Thailand&apos;s monarchy \u2013 to oversee economic, security and foreign affairs. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political analyst with Thailand&apos;s Institute of Security and International Studies, said the &quot;concrete focus on economic management and international relations&quot; was a good sign. &quot;The advisory council is a small step in the right direction on Thailand&apos;s long way back to normality and democratic rule,&quot; he said. General Prawit Wongsuwon, appointed as chairman of the advisory board, and General Anupong Paojinda, appointed to handle international relations, are well known royalists who, together with Prayuth, helped stage the 2006 coup that deposed the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a telecoms billionaire who is still at the heart of Thailand&apos;s political instability. According to Reuters, both Prawit and Anupong are said to have secretly supported anti-government protests that began last November against the Pheu Thai party, led by Thaksin&apos;s sister Yingluck, who was then serving as premier. Yingluck was ousted this month by a judicial ruling, along with nine cabinet members. The junta has faced fierce criticism over its detainment of more than 250 people seen as critical to the regime, who the military has said it can keep detained up to a week in undisclosed locations without access to their family, lawyers or personal belongings Yingluck, who reported to the army over the weekend, was released on Tuesday, while a number of high-profile &quot;red shirt&quot; activists were released from custody on Wednesday afternoon, among them the former leader Thida Thavornseth, her husband, Weng Tojirakarn, and the current leader, Jatuporn Prompan, according to the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD). On Tuesday the junta released so-called &quot;propaganda&quot; footage of five detainees, one of whom was Jatuporn. &quot;Now everyone knows how each other feels and that they do not want the country and everything to be damaged further,&quot; he was filmed saying \u2013 in reference, it seems, to the junta&apos;s desire that detainees reflect on their political standpoints. &quot;I never asked where this location is,&quot; he added, laughing. &quot;Nobody knows where it is.&quot; Those released from detention are told not to discuss their political opinions with others and in some cases must swear to refrain from engaging in anti-coup activities, it has been reported. Prayuth has promised elections but has not yet given a timeline for them, provoking concern among businesses, trade partners, human rights groups and foreign governments including the US, UK, Japan, Australia and the EU. A key trade and political ally of Thailand, the US has openly condemned the coup, freezing $3.5m in military aid and suspending military drills. But a senior official told Reuters that such actions may not be enough. &quot;We&apos;re going to have to continue to calibrate how we&apos;ll work with the government and military when they don&apos;t show any pathway back to civilian rule,&quot; the official said. &quot;We&apos;re very concerned, and there will be an impact on our relationship.&quot; While the seven-hour nationwide curfew has been relaxed to four hours, starting at midnight, a number of radio and television stations remain off-air, among them BBC and CNN. Eighty people, including the outspoken journalist Pravit Rojanaphruk from the Nation newspaper and the former education minister Chaturon Chaisaeng, who was publicly arrested on Tuesday, remain in detention.

In the wake of international news channels such as CNN and the BBC being taken off air, as well as HBO and the Disney Channel, it is especially significant that this small but pointed gesture of protest should have sprung from popular culture. The salute in The Hunger Games represents a way for the downtrodden people of Panem to mutely register their defiance of the government. Not that those using it in the film escape censure (or worse).

Members of the activist-hackers group Anonymous were early adopters; Occupy Wall Street also took up the mask in the fight against corporate greed.

The concrete and steel architecture of power surrounds them but they are as one in their arcane gesture of freedom. Arcane, that is, if you are not following The Hunger Games. In Thailand this weekend protesters against the military seizure of power adopted a salute from The Hunger Games \u2013 which, in case you live under a rock or only watch Jean-Luc Godard movies, is a series of films based on novels by Suzanne Collins in which a dystopian empire divides to rule. Separating its subject peoples into closed districts, the regime forces each to yield up young &quot;tributes&quot; to participate in the annual televised Hunger Games. This gladiatorial fight to the death is supposed to distract and terrify the populace. The ritual goes wrong, however, when rebellion is sparked by the games themselves. You probably already know all that, and you can probably also see why the Hunger Games salute might become reality on the streets of Bangkok. The Hunger Games is about resisting a totalitarian regime. Thailand has just experienced a coup. But this symbolism is stranger than it looks. On closer examination it reveals something about the bankruptcy of political beliefs in the 21st century.     Jennifer Lawrence in The Hunger Games. Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar    When the best political imagery available comes from a corny series of paranoid science fiction films that are retro-1970s science fiction at best, and vacuous adolescent fantasy at worst, there is something missing. The Thai protesters&apos; resort to the world of The Hunger Games for a subversive symbol is reminiscent of Occupy&apos;s use of the Guy Fawkes mask from V for Vendetta. It seems that films and comics, rather than conventional political ideologies, are the texts from which modern radicalism takes its imagery. This is understandable. The old mass movements of the 19th and 20th centuries, with their potent shared symbols, collapsed with the end of the Soviet Union. Communism&apos;s clenched fist is tainted by failure and violence. Trade union banners, red flags and Che T-shirts have all become icons of the past, not the present. Anyway, the Thai protests are about democracy, not socialism. Should they wave the tricolour of the French Revolution? The stars and stripes? In an age of torched ideologies and ruined utopias, the symbols of dissent have to be newly forged, recast out of what comes to hand. What comes easiest to hand is popular culture. But do The Hunger Games or V for Vendetta really offer useful images, or does this reliance on them reveal a tragic intellectual vacuum? Images have meaning. The clenched fist of Marxist revolutionaries was not just a gesture. Behind it lay a history of revolution going back to 1789 and a huge body of serious political thought from The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte to the writings of Antonio Gramsci. But what does it actually mean to claim allegiance to The Hunger Games?     An Occupy protester wearing a V for Vendetta mask in Madrid in 2012. Photograph: Action Press/Rex Features    The dystopian setting of these films has nothing to do with reality. In spite of vague satirical swipes at reality television and fashion, this cinematic world is basically a heady concoction of wilful absurdities. A daft fictional evil regime that is a monstrous blend of Terry Gilliam&apos;s Brazil and The X Factor downtreads its noble innocent victims until they fight back. The whole thing is rooted in teenagers&apos; sensibilities and its images of politics are there to drive up dramatic tension, and sell more DVDs. Job done. As a political analysis The Hunger Games is, I grant, perhaps a tiny bit more realistic than V for Vendetta, in which Britain is a fascist state and the only way to fight it is to plant a bomb under parliament. Yeah man, that&apos;s so like today it&apos;s uncanny. Bring back Marxism \u2013 at least it tried to think things through. Marx himself would have thought the emptiness of today&apos;s radical imagery beneath scorn.

But it does not go far enough. While noting the incomplete democratic revolution of 1932 and the place of the royal court in the &quot;old&quot; establishment democratically overthrown by Thaksin Shinawatra, it underplays the decades-long campaign by the king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, to recoup power for the monarchy. Paul M Handley (in The King Never Smiles: A Biography of Thailand&apos;s Bhumibol Adulyadej) observed: &quot;[r]ather than accepting his position as simply a benign cultural object like the modern Japanese or British monarchs, Bhumibol made himself a full-fledged, dominant political actor&quot;. Reviewing Handley&apos;s book for the New York Review of Books, Ian Buruma commented: &quot;Bhumibol has never had much time for elected politicians, whom he tends to denigrate as selfish, venal and divisive. Tough military men and loyal bureaucrats are more congenial to his vision of unity, order and harmony under the wise, selfless, and virtuous monarch&quot;. Buruma is too kind. A revanchist monarchy is the central impediment to democracy in Thailand. It is probably too much to expect a religious people like the Thais to accept Denis Diderot&apos;s advice that &quot;Men will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest.&quot; But there will be no democracy in Thailand until the monarchy is abolished.Geoff MullenSydney, Australia The alienation of children Alex Renton&apos;s indictment of prep and public boarding school (23 May) will have rung bells for a lot of old inmates. And (unlike your Guardian Weekly headline, The abusers could still be teaching) he&apos;s wise not to make too much of the physical cruelty and sexual abuse entailed. What does more damage is the routine alienation of young children from family and community, and the systematic substitution of formal hierarchy, models and discipline for the intimate interaction of home life. For working-class families, to have a child taken into care has been a proof of failure; for certain middle-class families, it&apos;s still proof of success, and a prudent investment in future success \u2013 however partial \u2013 as emotion and energy are diverted to competitive performance. I blame the middle-class parents. If not my own, then theirs who brought them up unable or unwilling to care for us, or trust any common humanity beyond their class. I can&apos;t say I suffered much at school, but by the end of each school holiday I felt the cold and darkness creeping in. When the school train pulled away, the tears may have been in my parents&apos; eyes, not mine. Not every painful separation is avoidable. We all know about cutting the cord. But who asks what happens at the other end of the cord, inside the baby? Could that be where a lot of later emotion comes home to roost, as subsequent partings and losses flit back to the old grand central station, onetime source of everything?Greg WilkinsonSwansea, UK Schools of economists I enjoyed Aditya Chakrabortty&apos;s article on the state of university economics departments (16 May). I\u00a0am encouraged to hear that current students are demanding that they be taught rather than indoctrinated. Perhaps the problem is that these economics schools are being considered in the wrong light. As any liberal arts professor might suggest, let&apos;s start by &quot;unpacking&quot; the institution&apos;s title: while a &quot;school of economics&quot; is clearly economic for the university, the &quot;school&quot; part has obviously been read in the wrong context. Instead of being a place of learning and open debate, please think of these institutions instead as large groups of cold-blooded vertebrates moving in unison to find food and protect themselves from perceived threats. This type of &quot;school&quot; is better used for studying the biology of complex human systems or as economics case studies themselves \u2013 how they are used by universities to collect revenue or &quot;food&quot; from students, alumni and corporate partners, and how their policies move according to shifting currents rather than better understanding. Only rarely should these &quot;schools&quot; be thought of as a part of a university&apos;s attempts to be a source of enlightenment.Dave ScottToronto, Canada \u2022 Aditya Chakraborrty&apos;s statement that &quot;mainstream economists are liberal in theory but can be [sic] authoritarian in practice&quot;, just misses the crux of the issue: namely, the impact of peer review. That practice may well be beneficial in physics or chemistry but, in other disciplines, it is the weapon by which a senior tenured faculty ensures that young aspirants cannot rock the academic boat \u2013 even where the ship is run by fools!Philip StiggerBurnaby, British Columbia, Canada The death of the novel Yet another dire prediction that books, especially novels, are doomed (23 May). And yet another reference to Marshall McLuhan, who apparently predicted the advent of the books&apos; nemesis, the internet, as the inevitable result of the broadcast technology that existed in his time. In any case, Will Self laments the possible loss of his livelihood as a novelist, and predicts that students expecting to follow in his footsteps will be swallowed whole into the swamp of unread theses, coming up for air only to teach others like themselves who will face the same fate. Such, as Self says, is the inevitable follow-up to &quot;a self-perpetuating and self-financing literary set-aside scheme to accommodate writers who can no longer make a living from their work&quot;. Self ignores the fact that there are vast numbers of non-writers who still buy novels, and who consider it one of life&apos;s greatest pleasures to lounge comfortably with a good hardcover book. I have no idea whether the invention of the telephone was considered the work of the devil, but it made us more conversant. By the same token, books in any form are living messages from writers to whom we can still respond.Richard OrlandoWestmount, Quebec, Canada The horrors of coal While I agree with Simon Jenkins (23 May) that coal power must go, I think he could do with having a better look at the energy sector. Oil, gas and nuclear all receive (very) large subsidy, and add to the problem of climate change. The renewable issue is mostly with their intermittent nature. The solution is clearly development of distributed-energy storage, which would enable us to avoid the use of coal as the back-up power source. I find the idea of using neighbourhood-scale hydrogen power very compelling \u2013 the hydrogen can be produced by renewable energy and then used to fill the gaps from the renewable supply. The answer to the climate problem is going to need new ideas to fix it \u2013 relying on slightly different mixes of old ones is sure to fail.Rohan ChadwickBristol, UK \u2022 I largely agree with Simon Jenkins&apos;s prescription to focus more on gas and nuclear power to reduce coal use. Yet, in discounting solar and wind power, he missed the big picture. While it is true that coal dependency is rising in Germany and electricity is costly due to high use of solar and wind power, the investment made in creating a market for these technologies has brought down costs dramatically over the past 10 years \u2013 with an eight-fold reduction for solar. The rest of the world benefits. Solar and wind power need to be part of the global solution to climate change.Phil Napier-MooreBangkok, Thailand Briefly \u2022 It shouldn&apos;t surprise your writer that since the US has interfered with elected governments in Egypt and Ukraine, the Iranians think they may be next (23 May).

The symbol has become a popular form of protest following the junta&apos;s seizure of power on 22 May. A military spokesman told the Associated Press that its use was being monitored and would lead to intervention by the authorities in certain circumstances. &quot;We know it comes from the movie, and let&apos;s say it represents resistance against the authorities,&quot; Colonel Weerachon Sukhondhapatipak said. &quot;If a single individual raises three fingers in the air, we are not going to arrest him or her.

In Thailand, some protesters took to Twitter to explain its adoption. &quot;Dear #HungerGames,&quot; tweeted one user. &quot;We&apos;ve taken your sign as our own. Our struggle is non-fiction. Thanks.&quot; The move follows the military&apos;s decision, in the wake of the bloodless coup, to ban foreign TV channels such as the BBC, CNN, HBO and the Disney Channel. Local journalists have been warned not to criticise the junta, and there are suggestions that Facebook and Twitter could face restrictions if they are used to protest.

How about a free haircut or hot meal? A dance show by women in PVC miniskirts? Perhaps a chance to pet a pony? All this \u2013 and more \u2013 is now available to you courtesy of the Royal Thai Army&apos;s &quot;Happiness&quot; campaign, which is staging free festivals across Bangkok to &quot;bring back happiness&quot; to the Thai public following last month&apos;s military coup. A bizarre combination of an army-controlled street party and a music festival, the &quot;parties&quot; have been taking place in parks and squares, where the public is showered with free food and drink and given an opportunity to watch the army sing and dance \u2014 and take selfies next to trussed-up soldiers. The campaign is by order of Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha, who took control of Thailand two weeks ago in a military coup that has been condemned nationally and internationally. About 300 people have been detained since the army seized power on 22 May, among them academics, journalists, activists, politicians and human rights defenders. Those protesting against the coup have held flash mobs in shopping malls, holding up banners likening junta-ruled Thailand to George Orwell&apos;s Nineteen Eighty-Four and flashing three-fingered &quot;Hunger Games&quot; salutes to show resistance.The army has cracked down on anti-coup protesters, banning the three-fingered salute and today arresting a motorcycle-taxi driver for distributing anti-coup leaflets, local media reported. But Prayuth has said the coup should be celebrated as an opportunity for Thais to feel good after a long stretch of political in-fighting left the country deeply divided. &quot;The Thai people, like me, have probably not been happy for nine years,&quot; he said last month. &quot;But since May 22, there is happiness.&quot; The junta, which calls itself the National Council for Peace and Order, (NCPO) has been circulating the theme of &quot;happiness&quot; extensively since overthrowing the democratically elected government. It has plans for a new &quot;happiness index&quot; to determine how people feel after the coup, while Prayuth is delivering a weekly TV and radio programme called Returning Happiness to the People, to discuss the junta&apos;s decisions and plans. At Victory Monument, the very site where demonstrators were until a few days ago, the army on Wednesday set up trucks, loudspeakers, a stage and even a petting zoo \u2013 complete with bales of hay, horses, a cowboy mannequin and a ceramic teepee. Nearby there was a selfie stand in front of a giant banner reading HAPPINESS, allowing the public to take pictures of themselves with soldiers in riot gear and wraparound sunglasses. &quot;Oh, he&apos;s so handsome, take my picture!&quot; shouted one young woman as she queued for a photo. The coup has prompted a selfie-craze of sorts, with the trending Twitter hashtag &quot;Show me a hot soldier&quot; morphing into photos of Thai people in fancy dress, then even of newlyweds posing with soldiers or next to army trucks. &quot;My heart feels good like this, because before [the coup] people were acting sick in the head,&quot; said Lt Pipat Boonrungruang, manning the crowd. &quot;This is fun and it makes people smile.&quot; At the main stage, a surreal mix of propaganda and performance was taking place. The crowd went wild as young male soldiers drummed helmets and metal food plates in a Thai military version of Stomp, throwing red roses and money at the stage, followed by a dance show with women in PVC miniskirts and glittering belts. &quot;Does this make me happy? Yes,&quot; said Farida Lee, 40, who was taking pictures of the dancers. &quot;It makes the nation happy, sure. Without the army we would have had more fighting, more problems, more people killed. This is a good thing. Prayuth is good.&quot; As for the free haircuts, oddly they were nowhere to be found. &quot;No, no haircuts today,&quot; said a soldier watching the show, who then did a polite little bow. &quot;I&apos;m truly sorry.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-06-04T20:04:47Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/04/thailand-to-bring-happiness-to-the-people", "title": "Thai junta 'brings happiness to the people' with parties and selfies", "sentences": ["All this \u2013 and more \u2013 is now available to you courtesy of the Royal Thai Army&apos;s &quot;Happiness&quot; campaign, which is staging free festivals across Bangkok to &quot;bring back happiness&quot; to the Thai public following last month&apos;s military coup."]}, {"article": "Tom Rachman&apos;s second novel is a great jigsaw-puzzle of a book, spanning a quarter of a century and with its pieces scattered all over the world. Its heroine is Matilda Zylberberg, known as Tooly, and what aims to hook the reader in is not so much the possibility of finding out what happens as finding out what once happened. Tooly \u2013 whom we meet running a moribund secondhand bookshop in a one-horse town in the Welsh borders \u2013 has lived a peripatetic life. We get glimpses of it as the narrative jumps back and forth. In 1988, a nine-year-old Tooly and an adult, perhaps her father, identified as Paul, are leaving Australia for Bangkok. In 1999, Tooly is in Brooklyn, hanging out with an elderly Russian eccentric called Humphrey. How did she get from there to there? Where did Paul vanish to, and when? Other characters, whose relationships to each other and Tooly herself are obscure, start to appear. There&apos;s Sarah, a fortysomething flibbertigibbet who comes unpredictably in and out of\u00a0the story, now love-bombing Tooly, now abandoning her. And there&apos;s Venn,\u00a0a charismatic figure who seems to live on the borders of criminality and violence, yet who is cast as Tooly&apos;s great protector and friend. He, too, comes and goes unpredictably. This is a book about constant motion. Almost every character we meet is in some way rootless, whether by choice or accident or aspiration. Fogg, the loquacious nebbish who helps Tooly in the bookshop, is almost the only character with any fixity: he was born in Caergenog and is unlikely ever to leave it, though he considers himself a Parisian boulevardier by destiny, or at least inclination. Humphrey \u2013 whose travels, we&apos;re told, took him from the gulag to South Africa \u2013 claims to have been &quot;cornered by history&quot;. Paul seems to be on the run. Sarah, feckless, seems on the run from herself. The hero-worshipped Venn impresses on Tooly the importance of being detached from the world\u00a0and other people. It&apos;s a lesson Tooly appears to have learned. She presents at first as a sort of hybrid of Zooey Deschanel and Pippi\u00a0Longstocking. She moved every year of her childhood from school to\u00a0school and her character itself is fugitive, preliminary: &quot;At each new school, in each new country, she presented a new personality.&quot; Her hobby as a teenager is to wander Manhattan, talking her way into other people&apos;s apartments by pretending she\u00a0used to live there. While playing that game she meets a young law student, Duncan, who becomes her boyfriend in the late 90s and whose more settled adulthood and unshowy kindness anchors the later parts of the plot. Duncan, in the novel&apos;s present day, re-establishes contact with Tooly to tell her that Humphrey (whom he believes to be her father) is ill \u2013 and it&apos;s\u00a0her rediscovery of Humphrey, now pitiably frail and (bizarrely) having lost\u00a0his Russian accent, that drives her determination to unravel what actually happened in her past. To my taste, at least at the outset, Rachman steers dangerously close to\u00a0being merely whimsical. There&apos;s something slightly cutesy about the wall-to-wall eccentricity, something slightly precious about the fey withholding of information from the reader. Tooly isn&apos;t quite the Manic Pixie Dream Girl stereotype, but she threatens to be. You find yourself thinking: get on with it. But if you stick\u00a0with it, Rachman hits his stride. The Rise and Fall of Great Powers gestures with its title and its scope at something world-spanning. That&apos;s semi-ironic. Its background music is\u00a0world-historical \u2013 there are intermittent bursts of chat about Reagan and Gorbachev, 9/11, the Rwandan genocide and the Clinton impeachment \u2013 but it&apos;s at its heart about individual lives: how opaque we\u00a0are to each other,\u00a0and how little we\u00a0understand our own histories. This is a book threaded with other books \u2013 the groaning shelves of the World&apos;s End bookshop in Caernenog; Paul&apos;s bird books; the great European philosophers Humphrey reads, mashed-potato sandwich at hand (&quot;You are 10 years old, and you not read Oswald Spengler?&quot;); the books through which Tooly educates herself.\u00a0Of all the books-within-the-book, the one that pops up most insistently is Nicholas Nickleby, another epic of happenstance and reversed fortune, of\u00a0semi-orphanhood and unlikely patronage. It&apos;s in something of that spirit that, as the book moves towards its end, the strange gravities that hold its constellation of characters together start to make sense \u2013 upsetting both Tooly&apos;s and the reader&apos;s expectations in a satisfying and rather poignant way. And even as they are understood, they vanish. The things time does to identity, its little incremental extinctions, come to the very centre of\u00a0Rachman&apos;s attention. And here, perhaps, is where all those books \u2013 and this book \u2013 enter in: &quot;People kept their books, she thought, not because they were likely to read them again but because these objects contained the past \u2013 the texture of being oneself at a particular place, at a particular time, each volume a piece of one&apos;s intellect, whether the work itself had\u00a0been loved\u00a0or despised or had induced a snooze on page 40.&quot; I\u00a0had a\u00a0little snooze on page 40, but by page\u00a0340 I was bolt awake.

Amid all that, there&apos;s one case that&apos;s unlikely to catch much attention. It sits in the in-tray of a Bangkok administrative court, and concerns a dispute between a director and Thailand&apos;s board of film censors. The movie in question has been banned since 2012, when the censors decreed that it possessed &quot;content that causes divisiveness among the people of the nation&quot;. The director&apos;s name is Ing Kanjanavanit. The title of her film is Shakespeare Tong Tai (Shakespeare Must Die). Even by the fraught standards of Thailand&apos;s recent history, the idea of a 450-year-old poet being politically too hot to handle seems surreal. But then everything about this story is surreal: belligerent title aside, the film is a dutiful adaptation of Shakespeare&apos;s Macbeth, faithful to nearly every jot and scribble of the text (at 172 minutes, it&apos;s not for lightweights). It received 3m Thai baht (\u00a354,000) in funding from Thailand&apos;s Ministry of Culture, two years before a different branch of the same ministry decided to outlaw it. Ing has been attacked as a royalist sympathiser and a dangerous subversive, and simultaneously lauded as a selfless defender of free speech. She and I are sitting on a bench outside the campus of National Taiwan University in Taipei, where Shakespeare Must Die has just been screened. The air is heavy with traffic fumes from the evening rush hour; you could slice the humidity with a knife. The reason we&apos;ve abandoned the blissful air-con of the screening room for the bench is so that Ing can smoke. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she says, genuinely troubled. &quot;Sorry. Really, you don&apos;t mind?&quot; Slight and neat with a patient, wide gaze, Ing (who as a director goes under the name of Ing K) doesn&apos;t look like a firebrand. Born in 1959, she was sent to boarding school in Derbyshire and studied for her A-levels in Godalming, Surrey; her English has a pleasingly antiquated quality. It is easier to picture her as a smalltown university lecturer than a dangerous rabble-rouser. I run through the outlines of the case, to check I&apos;m not missing something. She smiles wanly. &quot;Two years now,&quot; she says. &quot;We have no idea when we&apos;ll get our day in court. It could be any day, it could be much longer. But when the country&apos;s like this, who cares about a movie?&quot; &apos;I use Thaksin to illustrate Shakespeare, not the other way around. I could just shout rude words on the street; plenty of people do. It&apos;d be much less trouble&apos; The project began in earnest in 2007, when Ing had finished her previous film, Polamuang Juling (Citizen Juling), a documentary about the death of a teacher assaulted by a group of Muslim women in southern Thailand. Convinced that Juling was too controversial for international festivals, she began translating Macbeth to keep her mind off things. &quot;I just wanted to have no brain left for anything else. So I went back to Shakespeare.&quot; As it happened, in 2008 Juling was selected by the Toronto festival, where the New York Times praised it as &quot;unflinchingly and achingly human&quot;. Soon after, it was accepted by Berlin. But by then Ing had become consumed by Macbeth; her partner Manit Sriwanichpoom, one of Thailand&apos;s leading photographers, who had also collaborated on Juling, produced. Together they called it Shakespeare Must Die (no relation to Paolo and Vittorio Taviani&apos;s Caesar Must Die, which came out later: eerie coincidence, she smiles). Though she wanted to translate Shakespeare&apos;s text into Thai as precisely as possible, Ing wanted to make the play contemporary. She sensed it could be a pointed analogue for her country&apos;s turbulent recent history, which had witnessed the arrival of the tycoon Thaksin Shinawatra as prime minister in 2001 (a hero to some; a corrupt dictator to others), his overthrow in 2006, and the subsequent tumultuous power struggles, capped by this latest military coup \u2013 perhaps the 12th Thailand has seen since 1932 (calculations vary). In the film, Macbeth/Dear Leader, played with porcine cunning by Pisarn Pattanapeeradej, transitions with alarming rapidity from dutiful officer to narrow-eyed megalomaniac, chillaxing in his garishly overdecorated compound. Fiona Tarini Graham&apos;s Lady M is sensual and vengeful, always on the brink; she ends her life in the palace pool, like a subtropical Ophelia.            Even if you&apos;re unversed in the intricacies of Thai politics, it is not hard to see Thaksin&apos;s shadow falling across the screenplay. That at least seems to have been the view of the censors, who decreed that it was &quot;in conflict with peaceful social order or good public morality&quot;, and demanded changes \u2013 notably objecting to its use of the colour red, associated with Thaksin&apos;s supporters. The film had been funded by an opposition-led government; by the time it came to be licensed, Thaksin&apos;s sister Yingluck was prime minister. Ing concedes she is hardly a fan of a man she accuses of a &quot;blatant and obscene lack of ethics&quot;, but rejects the accusation that the film is anti-Thaksin propaganda: her use of red, for instance, was decided long before it became associated with his redshirts. &quot;I use Thaksin to illustrate Shakespeare, not the other way around. I could just shout rude words on the street; plenty of people do. It&apos;d be much less trouble.&quot; And in fact Shakespeare Must Die is stranger and more multivalent than that, a hallucinogenic play-within-a-play in which a staged production of Macbeth drifts into dreamlike reality, then out of it again. Some scenes occur in what looks like a theatre, complete with watching audience; others are more straightforwardly naturalistic. One of the most disturbing sections occurs at the end, where Macbeth&apos;s execution bleeds into a scene resembling the notorious massacre at Thammasat University in Bangkok on 6 October 1976. The facts are disputed, but police and rightwing paramilitaries were accused of torturing and murdering at least 46 pro-democracy students, some of whom had been staging satirical theatre as part of their protests, an ominous interleaving of art and life. &quot;Macbeth ends optimistically: the bad guy dead, all that,&quot; says Ing. &quot;But in real life it&apos;s not a happy ending. The film is a kind of warning.&quot; &apos;What can you do? You just go on and on. Put one foot in front of the other&apos; If it is a warning, few have been able to attend to it. Barred from public screening in Thailand, Shakespeare Must Die has been seen only in campus settings and at a handful of festivals in Asia. Ing grinds out her cigarette. &quot;The guy from Cannes said: &apos;Why are you making such an unimaginative adaptation?&apos; If I had made Macbeth a pimp and set it in a Bangkok red-light district, Lady M as a whorehouse madam, the Witches transvestite drag queens, it would have gone everywhere.&quot; Her response to the impasse was to do what she did before: pick up a camera. Watching her partner return from meeting after fruitless meeting with the men in suits, Ing decided to come along, too \u2013 partly to keep him company, partly as legal cover. Initially she had no thought of turning the footage into a film, but as they journeyed from being denied a rating to public protests to a failed appeal, a plotline began to emerge: a shoestring Waiting for Godot with overtones of Kafka; high Shakespearean tragedy transformed into a bureaucratic comedy of errors, complete with a cast of hapless, face-saving goons. They called it Censor Must Die. It&apos;s not without laughs: on one occasion Manit is made to wait while the board urgently reviews the family film Dear Doggies 2; on another Ing is expelled to the culture ministry lobby, whereupon her camera lingers on a fatuous instructional video on the niceties of Thai etiquette. &quot;This is their mentality, so out of step with the times. It&apos;s absurd. Like Alice in Wonderland.&quot; Equally Alice in Wonderland is the fact that \u2013 presumably embarrassed by having outlawed a film co-written by Shakespeare \u2013 the authorities have allowed Censor Must Die to pass, on the basis that it depicts &quot;events that really happened&quot;. &quot;But effectively it&apos;s been banned,&quot; says Ing. &quot;They threatened to sue a cinema that put it on. What cinema wants to screen documentaries anyway?&quot; The court case is still pending; she and Manit are busily considering alternative ways to screen their work in Bangkok. And Ing has been shooting yet another documentary, this time following the anti-government protesters camped around Bangkok&apos;s Victory monument and filmed largely on her iPhone. Her working title is Bangkok Joyride. She&apos;s been working on it for seven months. A long time, I say. She shrugs helplessly: &quot;I haven&apos;t got an ending yet.&quot; Back in London, I call up Ing to check how she&apos;s doing. It&apos;s now 10 days after the military moved in. She is more optimistic than I expect: perhaps there will be a political settlement, she says. The court case is progressing. And she has her ending \u2013 to Bangkok Joyride, at least. Gatherings of more than five people are now outlawed; she was filming on the day the soldiers arrived. A conclusion of sorts. The phone line makes her sound a world away. &quot;What can you do?&quot; she says. &quot;You just go on and on.

Distasteful because even as the Syrian leader brandished his ballot paper, his military forces were dropping a barrel bomb, the regime&apos;s new terror weapon of choice, on the citizens of Aleppo. Disturbing because such a staged photograph is an established trademark of democracy around the world. It is the sort of picture elected politicians everywhere like to pose for. It sends a reassuring message of order, normality and one-person, one-vote humility. You see: the great man is just like you and me. Except Assad is not an ordinary guy. No man of the people he, Assad is a dictator whose &quot;presidential election&quot;, held only in those urban areas under government control and boycotted by all credible opposition groups, was a travesty and a sham. He rules because his late father, Hafez, and Syria&apos;s Alawite oligarchy handed him the job in 2000. Early on, he fluffed good opportunities to pursue reform. Since the initially peaceful demonstrations against his regime began more than three years ago, he has proved himself, by turns, foolish, craven and vicious. He exacerbated divisions and escalated the war by resorting to ever more extreme, indiscriminate violence. He is not an elected president. He is a killer and a war criminal with the names of 162,000 dead Syrians on his personal electoral roll. Historically speaking, Assad is something else, too: a political &quot;strongman&quot; in the dismaying tradition of a region that seems pitifully prone to domination by fiercely driven, unscrupulous and often unsavoury individuals with dictatorial tendencies. In recent times, Saddam Hussein in Iraq was one such; Muammar Gaddafi in Libya was another. In Egypt, Hosni Mubarak, a former general, succeeded Anwar Sadat, himself a political heir to the arch-strongman, Gamal Abdel Nasser. Now, following Mubarak&apos;s overthrow in 2011, Egypt is once again on the receiving end of strongman politics with the rise of another general, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. His ascent to the presidency was supposedly legitimised in last month&apos;s national elections. But despite being virtually unopposed, he took only 23m out of 53m potential votes on a turnout well below 50%. Time will tell whether Sisi is the firm-handed, sure-footed leader Egypt needs, as his backers claim. But one thing is already clear: he is no democrat and most Egyptian voters know it. Egypt&apos;s first elected president, Mohamed Morsi, remains in jail after his ousting last year by Sisi&apos;s armed forces, along with 15,000 of his Muslim Brotherhood supporters. An estimated 1,400 people have died. Sisi&apos;s intimidatory shadow hovers over Egypt&apos;s institutions, including the judiciary and media. An official personality cult is in the making. And in an approach that has resonated as far as Bangkok, where Thai military coup leaders seem to have taken a cue from Sisi, Egypt&apos;s new strongman stresses stability over human rights and civic freedoms. How he plans to tackle Egypt&apos;s crushing economic and social problems is less certain. However he does it, he is sure to do it firmly. Strongman politics is both contagious and increasingly back in fashion across the Middle East, where the democratic promise of the Arab Spring revolts has mostly turned to dust and tears. Having failed to establish a united national government despite several attempts, Libyans are now witnessing, and to some degree welcoming, the rise in the east of Khalifa Haftar, an army general intent on curbing the militias and jihadists. Nouri al-Maliki, Iraq&apos;s tough-guy prime minister, continues to dominate post-occupation politics in Baghdad. He is seeking a third term despite electoral setbacks last month and his failure to curb sectarian violence. From Algeria, which has just re-elected its de facto president for life, to Yemen, whose &quot;managed transition&quot; is on life support, democratic aspirations wilt as new strongmen flex their muscles or old ones refuse to quit. It might once have been tempting to attribute the strongman phenomenon to local conditions, history or national cultures. But that does not explain its vigour in today&apos;s connected world. One factor that does is foreign meddling. Assad survives, for example, not because he is wanted in Syria but because external rivalries allow it. Maintaining his regime suits Russia&apos;s purposes and those of Iran, while the US, Britain and their Gulf allies, eschewing direct military intervention, lack the means to force him out. In Egypt, Sisi quickly won the backing of Washington and its satellites because they recognise in him a pro-western, Mubarak-type figure with whom they can do business. Most of all, he is not Morsi. In Libya, Haftar has already gained the cautious approval of the US State Department. It would be too much to say the Americans miss Gaddafi. But they do seriously dislike the anarchy that developed after the west helped topple him. The same goes for Maliki in Iraq. The paradoxical failure of western democracies to promote democracy also aids the strongman surge. In Britain, France and other European countries, voters complain endlessly about the failure of politics, either boycotting the process or casting protest votes, as in last month&apos;s European parliament elections. They forget that the alternatives are all much worse. Preoccupied by post-2008 economic woes, the EU, the broadest alliance of democratic states in history, has signally failed to help Arab pro-democracy movements in practical, coherent ways since the first stirrings in Tunisia. Like the US, it is more comfortable with familiar, authoritarian figures such as Sisi than with projecting soft power to promote pluralist choices. This failure of supportive, exemplary democratic leadership is even more apparent in Washington, where the longer Barack Obama has remained in office, held hostage by a hostile Congress, the more myopic, seemingly, has become his global strategic vision. Whether the issue is anti-democratic developments in Asia and in and around Russia or, for example, using US leverage to help create a unified, democratic Palestinian state, Obama has often appeared personally detached, even uninterested. Into this vacuum has stepped, notably, Russia&apos;s Vladimir Putin, whose pernicious &quot;managed democracy&quot; paradigm has further undermined the prospect of genuine democratic advances in Arab Spring countries. The results of Putin-style elections are fixed in advance \u2013 a model increasingly popular in Africa, central Asia and the Middle East. Putin is the ultimate strongman.

The Guardian identified several of its customers and traced CP prawns to all of the top four global retailers \u2013 Walmart, Carrefour, Costco and Tesco \u2013 and other big-name supermarkets including Morrisons, the Co-operative, Aldi and Iceland. We asked those named in our investigation to comment on our finding of slavery in their supply chains. All said they condemned slavery and human trafficking for labour and conducted rigorous social audits. Some appeared already aware that slavery had been reported in the Thai fishing sector and said they were setting up programmes to try to tackle it. Walmart, the world&apos;s largest retailer, said: &quot;We are actively engaged in this issue and playing an important role in bringing together stakeholders to help eradicate human trafficking from Thailand&apos;s seafood export sector.&quot; Carrefour said it conducts social audits of all suppliers, including the CP factory that supplies it with some prawns. It tightened up the process after alerts in 2012. It admitted that it did not check right to the end of its complex chains. Costco told us it required its suppliers of Thai shrimp &quot;to take corrective action to police their feedstock sources&quot;. Tesco said: &quot;We regard slavery as completely unacceptable. We are working with CP Foods to ensure the supply chain is slavery-free, and are also working in partnership with the International Labour Organisation and Ethical Trading Initiative to achieve broader change across the Thai fishing industry.&quot; Morrisons said it would take the matter up with CP Foods urgently. &quot;We are concerned by the findings of the investigation. Our ethical trading policy forbids the use of forced labour by suppliers and their suppliers.&quot; The Co-operative was among those claiming it was already working to understand &quot;working conditions beyond the processing level&quot;. &quot;The serious issue of human trafficking on fishing boats is challenging to address and requires a partnership&quot; in which it is actively engaged, it said. Aldi UK said its contractual terms stipulate that suppliers do not engage in any form of forced labour. &quot;Aldi will not tolerate workplace practices and conditions which violate basic human rights.&quot; Iceland said it only sourced one line containing prawns from a CP Foods subsidiary but was pleased to note that CP was &quot;at the forefront of efforts to raise standards in the Thai fishing industry&quot;. The supermarket sector has been aware of conditions on some Thai fishing vessels for a while, thanks to reports from the UN and NGOs. In a 2009 survey by the UN inter-agency project on human trafficking (UNIAP) 59% of migrants who had been trafficked on to Thai fishing boats said they had seen the murder of a fellow worker. The Environmental Justice Foundation also reported on slavery and forced labour imposed by violence on Thai trawlers and alleged police collusion. Retailers have focused, however, on abuses that came to light further up the Thai prawn supply chain \u2013 in processing and packing factories or in companies subcontracted to peel prawns. It seems the parlous state of fish stocks and the pressure to monitor supply chains for sustainability has made the issue of slavery visible. Two retailers who did not wish to be named said that when they started to look at where fish for prawn feed was coming from, it became clear that the boats engaged in illegal fishing were also likely to be using trafficked forced labour. Retailers have joined an initiative called Project Issara (Project Freedom) to discuss their response and several were at a meeting with producers in Bangkok at the end of last month at which slavery was discussed.", "publicationDate": "2014-06-10T11:05:00Z", "tags": ["Slavery", "Thailand", "Fishing", "Supermarkets", "Walmart", "Tesco", "Global development", "World news", "Environment", "Business"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/10/walmart-tesco-costco-retailers-respond-prawn-supply-slaves", "title": "Walmart, Tesco and Costco among retailers responding to revelations of slavery in prawn supply chains", "sentences": ["Retailers have joined an initiative called Project Issara (Project Freedom) to discuss their response and several were at a meeting with producers in Bangkok at the end of last month at which slavery was discussed."]}, {"article": "     Slaves forced to work for no pay for years at a time under threat of extreme violence are being used in Asia in the production of seafood sold by major US, British and other European retailers, the Guardian can reveal. A six-month investigation has established that large numbers of men bought and sold like animals and held against their will on fishing boats off Thailand are integral to the production of prawns (commonly called shrimp in the US) sold in leading supermarkets around the world, including the top four global retailers: Walmart, Carrefour, Costco and Tesco. The investigation found that the world&apos;s largest prawn farmer, the Thailand-based Charoen Pokphand (CP) Foods, buys fishmeal, which it feeds to its farmed prawns, from some suppliers that own, operate or buy from fishing boats manned with slaves. Men who have managed to escape from boats supplying CP Foods and other companies like it told the Guardian of horrific conditions, including 20-hour shifts, regular beatings, torture and execution-style killings. Some were at sea for years; some were regularly offered methamphetamines to keep them going. Some had seen fellow slaves murdered in front of them. Fifteen migrant workers from Burma and Cambodia also told how they had been enslaved. They said they had paid brokers to help them find work in Thailand in factories or on building sites. But they had been sold instead to boat captains, sometimes for as little as \u00a3250. &quot;I thought I was going to die,&quot; said Vuthy, a former monk from Cambodia who was sold from captain to captain. &quot;They kept me chained up, they didn&apos;t care about me or give me any food \u2026 They sold us like animals, but we are not animals \u2013 we are human beings.&quot; Another trafficking victim said he had seen as many as 20 fellow slaves killed in front of him, one of whom was tied, limb by limb, to the bows of four boats and pulled apart at sea. &quot;We&apos;d get beaten even if we worked hard,&quot; said another. &quot;All the Burmese, [even] on all the other boats, were trafficked. There were so many of us [slaves] it would be impossible to count them all.&quot; CP Foods \u2013 a company with an annual turnover of $33bn (\u00a320bn) that brands itself as &quot;the kitchen of the world&quot; \u2013 sells its own-brand prawn feed to other farms, and supplies international supermarkets, as well as food manufacturers and food retailers, with frozen or cooked prawns and ready-made meals. It also sells raw prawn materials for food distributors. In addition to Walmart, Carrefour, Costco and Tesco, the Guardian has identified Aldi, Morrisons, the Co-operative and Iceland as customers of CP Foods. They all sell frozen or cooked prawns, or ready meals such as prawn stir fry, supplied by CP Foods and its subsidiaries. CP Foods admits that slave labour is part of its supply chain. &quot;We&apos;re not here to defend what is going on,&quot; said Bob Miller, CP Foods&apos; UK managing director. &quot;We know there&apos;s issues with regard to the [raw] material that comes in [to port], but to what extent that is, we just don&apos;t have visibility.&quot; The supply chain works in this way: Slave ships plying international waters off Thailand scoop up huge quantities of &quot;trash fish&quot;, infant or inedible fish. The Guardian traced this fish on landing to factories where it is ground down into fishmeal for onward sale to CP Foods. The company uses this fishmeal to feed its farmed prawns, which it then ships to international customers. The alarm over slavery in the Thai fishing industry has been sounded before by non-governmental organisations and in UN reports. But now, for the first time, the Guardian has established how the pieces of the long, complex supply chains connect slavery to leading producers and retailers. &quot;If you buy prawns or shrimp from Thailand, you will be buying the produce of slave labour,&quot; said Aidan McQuade, director of Anti-Slavery International. The Guardian conducted dozens of interviews with fishermen, boat captains, boat managers, factory owners and Thai officials in and around various ports in Thailand.Thailand enjoys a prime position as the world&apos;s largest prawn exporter in a vast seafood-export industry estimated to be worth some $7.3bn. Through multinationals such as CP Foods, Thailand ships out roughly 500,000 tonnes of prawns every year \u2013 nearly 10% of which is farmed by CP Foods alone. Although slavery is illegal in every country in the world, including Thailand, some 21 million men, women and children are enslaved globally, according to the International Labour Organisation. These people may have been sold like property, forced to work under mental or physical threat, or find themselves controlled by their &quot;employers&quot;. Thailand is considered a major source, transit and destination country for slavery, and nearly half a million people are believed to be currently enslaved within Thailand&apos;s borders. There is no official record of how many men are enslaved on fishing boats. But the Thai government estimates that up to 300,000 people work in its fishing industry, 90% of whom are migrants vulnerable to being duped, trafficked and sold to the sea. Rights groups have long pointed to Thailand&apos;s massive labour shortage in its fishing sector, which \u2013 along with an increased demand from the US and Europe for cheap prawns \u2013 has driven the need for cheap labour. &quot;We&apos;d like to solve the problem of Thailand because there&apos;s no doubt commercial interests have created much of this problem,&quot; admits CP Foods&apos; Miller.The Guardian&apos;s findings come at a crucial moment. After being warned for four consecutive years that it was not doing enough to tackle slavery, Thailand risks being given the lowest ranking on the US state department&apos;s human trafficking index, which grades 188 nations according to how well they combat and prevent human trafficking. Relegation to tier 3 would put Thailand, which is grappling with the aftermath of a coup, on a par with North Korea and Iran, and could result in a downgrade of Thailand&apos;s trading status with the US. &quot;Thailand is committed to combatting human trafficking,&quot; said the Thai ambassador to the US, Vijavat Isarabhakdi. &quot;We know a lot more needs to be done but we also have made very significant progress to address the problem.&quot; Although the Thai government has told the Guardian that &quot;combating human trafficking is a national priority&quot;, our undercover investigation unearthed a lawless and unregulated industry run by criminals and the Thai mafia \u2013 facilitated by Thai officials and sustained by the brokers who supply cheap migrant labour to boat owners. &quot;The Thai authorities could get rid of the brokers and arrange [legal] employment,&quot; one high-ranking Thai official, who is tasked with investigating human trafficking cases, said on condition of anonymity. &quot;But the government doesn&apos;t want to do that, it doesn&apos;t want to take action. As long as [boat] owners still depend on brokers \u2013 and not the government \u2013 to supply workers, then the problem will never go away.&quot; Human rights activists believe that Thailand&apos;s seafood-export industry would probably collapse without slavery. They say, there is little incentive for the Thai government to act and have called for consumers and international retailers to demand action. &quot;Global brands and retailers can do so much good without bringing too much risk upon themselves by simply enforcing their supplier standards, which typically prohibit forced labour and child labour,&quot; said Lisa Rende Taylor of Anti-Slavery International. &quot;And if local businesses realise that non-compliance results in loss of business, it has the potential to bring about huge positive change in the lives of migrant workers and trafficking victims.&quot;The Guardian asked the supermarkets to comment on our finding of slavery in their supply chains. All said they condemned slavery and human trafficking for labour. They all also pointed to systems of auditing they have in place to check labour conditions. Several retailers have joined a new initiative called Project Issara (Project Freedom) to discuss how they should respond and several attended a meeting in with the major producers in Bangkok at the end of last month at which slavery was discussed. Walmart, the world&apos;s largest retailer, said: &quot;We are actively engaged in this issue and playing an important role in bringing together stakeholders to help eradicate human trafficking from Thailand&apos;s seafood export sector.&quot; Carrefour said it conducts social audits of all suppliers, including the CP factory that supplies it with some prawns. It tightened up the process after alerts in 2012. It admitted that it did not check right to the end of its complex chains. Costco told us it would require its suppliers of Thai prawn &quot;to take corrective action to police their feedstock sources&quot;. A Tesco spokesperson said: &quot;We regard slavery as completely unacceptable. We are working with CP Foods to ensure the supply chain is slavery-free, and are also working in partnership with the International Labour Organisation [ILO] and Ethical Trading Initiative to achieve broader change across the Thai fishing industry.&quot; Morrisons said it would take the matter up with CP urgently. &quot;We are concerned by the findings of the investigation. Our ethical trading policy forbids the use of forced labour by suppliers and their suppliers.&quot; The Co-operative was among those saying it was already working to understand &quot;working conditions beyond the processing level&quot;. &quot;The serious issue of human trafficking on fishing boats is challenging to address and requires a partnership&quot; in which it is actively engaged.      The managing director of corporate buying at Aldi UK, Tony Baines, said: &quot;Our supplier standards, which form part of Aldi&apos;s contractual terms and conditions, stipulate that our suppliers must comply with applicable national laws, industry minimum standards and ILO and United Nations conventions of human rights, whichever standard is more stringent. &quot;These standards also require that suppliers do not engage in any form of forced labour and related practices. Aldi will not tolerate workplace practices and conditions which violate basic human rights.&quot; Iceland said it only sourced one line containing prawns from a CP subsidiary but it was pleased to note that CP was &quot;at the forefront of efforts to raise standards in the Thai fishing industry&quot;. CP said in a statement that it believed the right thing was to use its commercial weight to try to influence the Thai government to act rather than walk away from the Thai fishing industry, although it is putting in place plans to use alternative proteins in its feed so that it can eliminate Thai fishmeal by 2021 if necessary. It said it had already tightened controls over the way its fishmeal is procured. While it recognises that workers on boats are exploited, it added that the Thai department of fisheries continues to deny that unregistered boats are a problem. &quot;We can do nothing, and witness these social and environmental issues destroy the seas around Thailand, or we can help drive improvement plans. We are making good progress,&quot; it said. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 June 2014 as an earlier version said Thailand ships out roughly 50,000 tonnes of prawns every year.

The tattooed Burmese fisherman, 29, bears a number of other \u201creminders\u201d of his life at sea: two deep cuts on each arm, calloused fingers contorted like claws and facial muscles that twitch involuntarily from fear. For the past two years, Myint Thein has been forced to work 20-hour days as a slave on the high seas, enduring regular beatings from his Thai captain and eating little more than a plate of rice each day. But now that he\u2019s been granted a rare chance to come back to port, he\u2019s planning something special to mark the occasion: his escape. Using a pair of rusty scissors, Myint Thein chops off his long, scraggly locks. He rinses himself down with a hose, slips on his only pair of trousers and, peering out at his surroundings, remembers not to open his mouth too wide. A man with no teeth is easy to remember.           How slaves help put cheap prawns on our supermarket shelvesWARNING: some may find elements of this film distressing.    Under the tinny roof of Songkhla\u2019s commercial port, on Thailand\u2019s south-east coast, the imperial-blue cargo boat that brought Myint Thein back to shore is unloading its catch, barrel by barrel. The day\u2019s international fish trading has just begun, and buyers are milling about in bright yellow rubber boots, running slimy scales between their fingers, as hobbling cats nibble at the fishbones and guts strewn across the pavement. Myint Thein doesn\u2019t have much time to talk, so he tells us the basics. He paid a middleman two years ago to smuggle him across the border into Thailand and find him a job in a factory. After an arduous journey travelling through dense jungle, over bumpy roads and across rough waves, Myint Thein finally arrived in Kantang, a Thai port on its western, Andaman coast, where he discovered he\u2019d been sold to a boat captain. \u201cWhen I realised what had happened, I told them I wanted to go back,\u201d he says hurriedly. \u201cBut they wouldn\u2019t let me go. When I tried to escape, they beat me and smashed all my teeth.\u201d For the next 20 months, Myint Thein and three other Burmese men who were also sold to the boat trawled international waters, catching anything from squid and tuna to \u201ctrash fish\u201d, also known as bycatch \u2013 inedible or infant species of fish later ground into fishmeal for Thailand\u2019s multibillion-dollar farmed prawn industry. The supply chain runs from the slaves through the fishmeal to the prawns to UK and US retailers. The product of Myint Thein\u2019s penniless labour might well have ended up on your dinner plate.     Thai 'trash fish' workers unload the catch at Songkhla port. Chris Kelly/Guardian    Despite public promises to clean up the industry, many Thai officials not only turn a blind eye to abuse, the Guardian found, they are often complicit in it, from local police through to high-ranking politicians and members of the judiciary \u2013 meaning that slaves often have nowhere to turn when they have the opportunity to run. \u201cOne day I was stopped by the police and asked if I had a work permit,\u201d says Ei Ei Lwin, 29, a Burmese migrant who was detained on the docks at Songkhla port. \u201cThey wanted a 10,000 baht (\u00a3180) bribe to release me. I didn\u2019t have it, and I didn\u2019t know anyone else who would, so they took me to a secluded area, handed me over to a broker, and sent me to work on a trawler.\u201d Brokers Thailand produces roughly 4.2m tonnes of seafood every year, 90% of which is destined for export, official figures show. The US, UK and EU are prime buyers of this seafood \u2013 with Americans buying half of all Thailand\u2019s seafood exports and the UK alone consuming nearly 7% of all Thailand\u2019s prawn exports. \u201cThe use of trafficked labour is systematic in the Thai fishing industry,\u201d says Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch\u2019s Asia division, who describes a \u201cpredatory relationship\u201d between these migrant workers and the captains who buy them. \u201cThe industry would have a hard time operating in its current form without it.\u201d Speaking on condition of anonymity, a high-ranking broker explained to the Guardian how Thai boat owners phone him directly with their \u201corder\u201d: the quantity of men they need and the amount they\u2019re willing to pay for them. \u201cEach guy costs about 25,000-35,000 baht [\u00a3450-\u00a3640] \u2013 we go find them,\u201d explains the goateed broker, who operates out of the industrial fishing and prawn-processing hub of Samut Sakhon, just south of the capital, Bangkok.   Trafficking haven   \u201cThe boat owner finds the way to pay and then that debt goes to the labourers.\u201d At various points along the way, checkpoints are passed and officials bribed \u2013 with Thai border police often playing an integral role. \u201cPolice and brokers \u2013 the way I see it \u2013 we\u2019re business partners,\u201d explains the broker, who claims to have trafficked thousands of migrants into Thailand over the past five years. \u201cWe have officers working on both sides of the Thai-Burmese border. If I can afford the bribe, I let the cop sit in the car and we take the main road. \u201cThis is a big chain,\u201d he adds. \u201cYou have to understand: everyone\u2019s profiting from it. These are powerful people with powerful positions \u2013 politicians.\u201d The price captains pay for these men is a extremely low even by historical standards. According to the anti-trafficking activist Kevin Bales, slaves cost 95% less than they did at the height of the 19th-century slave trade \u2013 meaning that they are not regarded as investments for important cash crops such as cotton or sugar, as they were historically, but as disposable commodities. For the migrants who believed Thailand would bring them opportunity, the reality of being sent out to sea is devastating. \u201cThey told me I was going to work in a pineapple factory,\u201d recalls Kyaw, a broad-shouldered 21-year-old from rural Burma. \u201cBut when I saw the boats, I realised I\u2019d been sold \u2026 I was so depressed, I wanted to die.\u201d Chained Life on a 15-metre trawler is brutal, violent and unpredictable. Many of the slaves interviewed by the Guardian recalled being fed just a plate of rice a day. Men would take fitful naps in sleeping quarters so cramped they would crawl to enter them, before being summoned back out to trawl fish at any hour. Those who were too ill to work were thrown overboard, some interviewees reported, while others said they were beaten if they so much as took a lavatory break. Many of these slave ships stay out at sea for years at a time, trading slaves from one boat to another and being serviced by cargo boats, which travel out from Thai ports towards international borders to pick up the slave boats\u2019 catch and drop off supplies. The vessels catch fish and shellfish for domestic and international markets, including roughly 350,000 tonnes of trash fish, every year, according to the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). This trash fish is separated at sea and ferried back on cargo boats to shore, where it is ground down and turned into fishmeal for multinational companies such as CP Foods, which use it in animal feed for prawn, pig and chicken farming. CP in turn supplies food retailers and giant international supermarkets including Walmart, Tesco, Carrefour, Costco, Morrisons, the Co-operative and Iceland, with frozen and fresh prawns, and ready-made meals.       \u201cJust about every retailer in the United Kingdom buys material from CP,\u201d explains CP Foods\u2019 UK managing director, Bob Miller. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to defend what is going on. We know there\u2019s issues with regard to the [raw] material that comes in [to port], but to what extent that is, we just don\u2019t have visibility,\u201d says Miller. Extensive overfishing in the Gulf of Thailand has forced Thai fleets to travel further afield for longer periods to meet market demands. According to UN estimates, roughly 40% of all Thailand\u2019s seafood is now being caught in foreign waters, from Malaysia and Indonesia all the way out towards Papua New Guinea to the east and Bangladesh to the west. Coupled with mounting petrol prices, this overfishing has led to ever-decreasing profit margins for Thai boat captains, says Human Rights Watch\u2019s Robertson: \u201cWhat motivates is not concern for fishermen\u2019s welfare, but rather maximising catch and ensuring profitability, and that means 18- to 22-hour work days and martial discipline to keep men working.\u201d Of the 15 current and former slaves the Guardian interviewed during the investigation, 10 had witnessed a fellow fisherman murdered by his boat captain or net master. Ei Ei Lwin, the Burmese fisherman, claims he saw \u201c18 to 20 people killed in front of me\u201d. \u201cSome were shot, others were tied up with stones and thrown into the sea, and one was ripped apart,\u201d he says. \u201cHe hated his captain and tried to beat him to death. But the captain escaped by jumping into the sea. The other captains came and pinned [the fisherman] down. Then they tied up his hands and legs to four separate boats and pulled him apart.\u201d           Slavery in the Thai fishing industry: how a worker was tortured and killedWARNING: this animation contains graphic content    With nearly 50,000 registered fishing vessels, Thailand has one of the world\u2019s largest fishing fleets. But the Thai government admits this figure is merely an estimate of the number of Thai boats plying the seas. \u201cGhost boats\u201d \u2013 unlicensed replicas of properly registered and licensed boats \u2013 make up as much as half of Thailand\u2019s true fishing fleet, according to a 2011 International Organisation for Migration report. Boat managers, captains and fishermen \u2013 as well as the Royal Thai Marine police \u2013 described to the Guardian how \u201cghost licences\u201d allow boats unfettered access into Malaysian, Burmese or Indonesian waters, where other ghost boats then keep watch for patrolling authorities. \u201cThere\u2019s a technique,\u201d a high-ranking marine police officer in Kantang, on the Andaman coast, told the Guardian. \u201cIf you have 10 boats, you buy a licence for just two or three boats. Then you\u2019ll have two boats with the same name, and two with no name.\u201d He chuckles. \u201cIf they get stopped, they have a licence to show the authorities, but really it\u2019s a fake licence.\u201d Not every deep-sea trawler is a ghost boat or manned by slaves. But on two separate occasions at Songkhla port, the Guardian was present when two slaves were brought back to shore on cargo boats ferrying trash fish that they, and the other slaves on their boats, had trawled. On both occasions, the Guardian followed the trash fish as it was loaded on to trucks at port and delivered to two separate fishmeal factories that supply CP Foods \u2013 a direct link proving that the multinational was buying fishmeal from factories that have slavery in their supply chain. The industry CP said in a statement that it believed the right thing was to use its commercial weight to try to influence the Thai government to act rather than walk away from the Thai fishing industry, although it is putting in place plans to use alternative proteins in its feed so that it can eliminate Thai fishmeal by 2021 if necessary. While it recognises that workers on boats are exploited, it added that the Thai department of fisheries continues to deny that unregistered boats are a problem. \u201cWe can do nothing, and witness these social and environmental issues destroy the seas around Thailand, or we can help drive improvement plans. We are making good progress,\u201d it said.    First person account Aung Myo   CP said it requires and pays its 38 fishmeal factories to ensure that they only buy trash fish from legal and licensed boats. In theory, this requires boat captains to log the location, date, time, and quantity of their catch and to register their workers. But the Guardian discovered that in practice captains often fail to record trash fish data. Many of them also know there are slaves on the fishing trawlers but never report it to authorities. \u201cI don\u2019t care if the men are trafficked or not, I just buy the fish,\u201d one boat captain told the Guardian. \u201cI need to make money.\u201d And even fishmeal factory owners directly supplying CP doubt the veracity of these fishing logs. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s 100% true,\u201d said one factory owner in Songkhla. \u201cThat\u2019s why I want to take my own boat out to spy on them [the trawlers].\u201d The Thai government also admits that a new scheme to register boats as legal and licensed is plagued by corruption and a lack of political willpower. Songkhla\u2019s marine police told the Guardian that some fishing boat owners simply don\u2019t comply when requested to register their foreign workers. An official tasked with the job confirmed this. \u201cThe biggest problem we face is the politicians in this area,\u201d said the Thai fisheries department employee who was in the process of registering boats at port. \u201cThey own the fishing boats and some of them don\u2019t want to be regulated. They have their own laws, their own regulations, that\u2019s how they see it. They\u2019re more powerful than we are, so it means we can\u2019t really enforce the law.\u201d Thai law also prevents the authorities from curbing trafficking \u2013 for example, the Thai Royal Marine police are not allowed to patrol more than 12 miles from shore. \u201cThere are [slave] labourers out there in Indonesian and Malaysian waters who are being abused,\u201d one high-ranking policeman told the Guardian. \u201cBut I can\u2019t go there. I don\u2019t have the authority. All I can do is pressure the boat owners. If I go [into international waters] I will get shot at by the [relevant] authorities.\u201d     Hidden camera footage of Thai trawler slaves.The Guardian    Simon Funge-Smith, senior fishery officer at the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organisation\u2019s Asia-Pacific regional office, says the Thai government has failed to adopt legislation to keep up with fishing industry practices. \u201cFishing has evolved from happening a few miles from shore to thousands of miles away, from being entirely crewed by nationals to a high dependence on migrant labour,\u201d he says. \u201cRelevant departments have been complacent or simply constrained by limited capacity to bring procedures up to speed, so even simple procedures like inspecting a vessel to check crewlists, passports or catches, may not take place on board.\u201d CP Foods says that it will cut fishmeal out of its prawnfeed by 2021, but until then it hopes to address trafficking by working with the Thai government to register these problem trawlers.  \u201cWe\u2019d like to solve the problem of Thailand because there\u2019s no doubt commercial interests have created much of this problem, and it will be to the commercial aspects of the industry that the solutions will have to come,\u201d says Bob Miller. The Guardian\u2019s findings come at a crucial time for Thailand. After being warned for four consecutive years that it was not doing enough to tackle slavery within its borders, Thailand now risks being downgraded to the lowest ranking on the US state department\u2019s human trafficking index, which evaluates 188 nations according to how well they combat and prevent human trafficking. A relegation to Tier 3 would put Thailand on a par with North Korea and Iran, and could lead to a downgrade in Thailand\u2019s trading status with the US. The Thai government told the Guardian that it was \u201ccommitted to capturing, prosecuting and convicting unscrupulous actors in the fishing industry to hold them accountable for their crimes\u201d. But when we presented the Royal Thai navy with the exact coordinates and details of slave ships no immediate action was taken. The Thai government insists that it has formed task forces, increased trafficking prosecutions and coordinated inter-agency efforts to tackle slavery within its borders. \u201cThailand is committed to combating human trafficking, making it a top national priority,\u201d said Vijavat Isarabhakdi, the Thai ambassador to the US. \u201cWe know a lot more need to be done, but we also have made very significant progress to address the problem.\u201d \u201cTo maintain momentum on convictions, we need more than stories of atrocities. Thai enforcement action can happen when receiving all necessary information and cooperation from all stakeholders and in particular when we have names of vessels and those who have committed crimes.\u201d     A young Cambodian migrant worker loads barrels onto his boat at Songkhla port, Thailand. Photograph: Chris Kelly for the Guardian    But in the long years it has been working on this, very little change has actually taken place, says Mark Lagon, a former US ambassador to combat human trafficking. \u201cThe government knows in Thailand that there\u2019s a problem but they\u2019re not taking action. There is no connectivity between labour inspectors and law enforcement to hold traffickers to account. And, actually, the government is all too often complicit with corruption.\u201d Some Thai officials say the best way to break the cycle of human trafficking is for the Thai government to issue more permits to make it easier for migrants to work legitimately. \u201cRaids and rescues don\u2019t work,\u201d said a government official from the department of special investigations, Thailand\u2019s FBI. \u201cLet\u2019s say you rescue five trafficking victims. That means the [captain] now has to find another five workers, so the cycle continues.\u201d \u201cThe Thai government could get rid of the brokers and arrange [legal] employment,\u201d he added. \u201cAs long as business owners still depend on brokers \u2013 and not the government \u2013 to supply workers, then the problem will never go away.\u201d The anti-slavery campaigner Steve Trent of the Environmental Justice Foundation says slavery on Thai fishing boats is an open secret acknowledged by Thailand and the many governments and businesses that trade with it. \u201cThe supermarkets know this is happening,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone knows this is happening. From the boat to the shelf, the supermarkets have an opportunity to stop this \u2026 They are actively supporting slavery by not acting and, conversely, they could be actively working to get rid of it if they really had the desire.\u201d Lisa Rende Taylor, of Anti-Slavery International, said it was up to international retailers and globalised brands to demand change. \u201cIf local businesses realise that noncompliance results in loss of business and competitiveness, and that these brands and retailers will indeed reconsider their sourcing practices throughout their supply chain, it has the potential to bring about huge positive change in the lives of migrant workers and trafficking victims,\u201d she said. For the thousands of migrant workers currently in Thailand, that \u201cpositive change\u201d is as simple as a legal work permit and monthly paycheck in a regulated industry. Until that happens, however, migrants must fend for themselves \u2013 which explains why, when we phoned Myint Thein three days after he escaped in Songkhla, we discovered that he\u2019d taken his chances \u2013 and gone to out to sea on another fishing boat.     Cambodian migrant workers on their boat in Songkhla port, Thailand. Chris Kelly/Guardian    The supermarkets respond The Thai food giant CP Foods says it sells prawns to many of the leading supermarkets in the US, the UK and across Europe.  The Guardian identified several of its customers and traced CP prawns to all of the top four global retailers \u2013 Walmart, Carrefour, Costco and Tesco \u2013 and to other supermarkets including Morrisons, the Co-operative, Aldi, and Iceland.  We asked those named in our investigation to comment on our finding of slavery in their supply chains. All said they condemned slavery and human trafficking for labour. All also said they conducted rigorous social audits. Some appeared already aware that slavery had been reported in the Thai fishing sector, and said they were setting up programmes to try to tackle it. Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, told us: \u201cWe are actively engaged in this issue and playing an important role in bringing together stakeholders to help eradicate human trafficking from Thailand\u2019s seafood export sector.\u201d Carrefour said it conducts social audits of all suppliers, including the CP factory that supplies it with some prawns. It tightened up the process after alerts in 2012. It admitted that it did not check right to the end of its complex chains. Costco told us it required its suppliers of Thai shrimp \u201cto take corrective action to police their feedstock sources\u201d. Tesco told us: \u201cWe regard slavery as completely unacceptable. We are working with CP Foods to ensure the supply chain is slavery-free, and are also working in partnership with the International Labour Organisation and Ethical Trading Initiative to achieve broader change across the Thai fishing industry.\u201d Morrisons said it would take the matter up with CP Foods urgently. \u201cWe are concerned by the findings of the investigation. Our ethical trading policy forbids the use of forced labour by suppliers and their suppliers.\u201d The Co-operative was among those claiming it was already working to understand \u201cworking conditions beyond the processing level\u201d. \u201cThe serious issue of human trafficking on fishing boats is challenging to address and requires a partnership\u201d in which it is actively engaged, it said. Aldi UK said its contractual terms stipulate that suppliers do not engage in any form of forced labour and related practices. \u201cAldi will not tolerate workplace practices and conditions which violate basic human rights.\u201d Iceland said it only sourced one line containing prawns from a CP Foods subsidiary but was pleased to note that CP was \u201cat the forefront of efforts to raise standards in the Thai fishing industry\u201d. The supermarket sector has been aware of conditions on some Thai fishing vessels for a while, thanks to reports from the UN and non-governmental organisations. A 2009 survey by the UN inter-agency project on human trafficking (UNIAP) found that 59% of migrants it interviewed who had been trafficked on to Thai fishing boats said they had witnessed the murder of a fellow worker. The Environmental Justice Foundation also reported on slavery and forced labour imposed by violence on Thai trawlers, as well as alleged police collusion.  Retailers have focused until recently, however, on abuses that frequently came to light further up the Thai prawn supply chain \u2013 in processing and packing factories or in companies subcontracted to peel prawns. It seems that the parlous state of fish stocks and the pressure to monitor supply chains for sustainability has made the issue of slavery visible. Two retailers who did not wish to be named said that when they started to look at where fish for prawn feed was coming from, it became clear that the boats engaged in illegal fishing were also likely to be using trafficked forced labour.

Or a prawn on the barbie in the back yard? Just Sunday treats which everyone enjoys. Yet underneath the Marie Rose sauce lurks a tale of exploitation, environmental degradation, and, as our report today shows, in certain cases something even worse. The slave labour used in parts of the Thai prawn industry marks a new low point in the abuse of workers in poorer countries, and an even more urgent reminder to the better off in all countries that when we decide we do not care about how the things we use and consume are produced, we risk consigning vast numbers of people to harsh and dismal lives, and sometimes to sad and unnecessary deaths. The way we live in the rich world, which includes the affluent classes in less developed countries, imposes terrible costs on many of those who grow our food, make our clothes, mine our metals, cut our timber and otherwise sustain our generally comfortable existence. One day it is textile workers dead under a collapsed factory in Bangladesh. The next it is a wave of suicides in Chinese computer factories. The next the revelation that the trainers so many of us wear are put together by underage girls on miserably low wages. Each time there is a burst of revulsion, then pledges of improvements by both producers and importers \u2013 pledges which may or may not be kept. Movements like Fairtrade garner wide support but may also have unhappy side-effects. It is often hard to tell whether external pressures, such as they are, have improved things much, if at all. Our addiction as consumers to cheap things and the addiction of our corporations to excessive profits are the main drivers of this process of immiseration. It is important not to be utopian. We are not going to lose our obsession with shopping anytime soon, and the gradient in labour costs cannot be abolished. Indeed it is hard to see how the world economy could work without it. Even sweatshops may be better than the alternatives where the lower costs of labour may be one of the few comparative advantages possessed by governments intent on growth. Ideally, growth brings with it successful internal demands for better conditions, wages and union rights. But that does not mean we should just passively wait for such change. It can be accelerated. There must be action, above all, on forced and slave labour. The International Labour Organisation calculates that 21 million are in forced labour, trafficking, and modern slavery worldwide, bringing $150bn in illegal profits to those who organise it. Among the victims are the poor Cambodians and Burmese whose plight we describe today. Forced to crew Thai boats scouring the ocean for fish to feed the country&apos;s voracious prawn farms, they are treated as if they are almost as disposable as the fish they catch. The Thai fishing trade has always had a lawless side, its activities blurring into smuggling, piracy and worse. During the late 70s, Thai pirates murdered and plundered the &quot;boat people&quot; fleeing communist rule in Vietnam. Bangkok failed to control those excesses. There must be international pressure on the Thai government to act with greater effectiveness this time. What of us, the prawn eaters? The history of consumer boycotts is a spotty one, yet concerned customers can act to wake up their supermarkets. Let the big chains in turn use their considerable power to wake up their Asian suppliers, who in turn can upset the criminal labour brokers and gang masters who manage this vicious business. The prawn problem, which is really just one aspect of a seriously distorted global economy, would not end there. Overfishing for wild prawn is environmentally destructive, prawn farming hardly less so. Ultimately only a worldwide rebalancing of manufacturing and farming so that more is everywhere produced both locally and responsibly can disentangle the skein which binds together the mistreatment of workers, the mistreatment of nature, and the mistreatment of ourselves.", "publicationDate": "2014-06-10T16:43:10Z", "tags": ["Slavery", "Thailand", "Cambodia", "Food & drink industry", "Supermarkets", "Seafood", "Life and style", "Myanmar"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/10/supermarkets-slave-labour-problem-prawns", "title": "The Guardian view on the supermarkets' slave labour problem | Editorial", "sentences": ["Bangkok failed to control those excesses."]}, {"article": "     The US is considering downgrading Thailand on a human trafficking blacklist, following revelations in the Guardian that slaves are being used in the production of prawns sold in leading American, British and European supermarkets. Washington will directly address allegations of human trafficking in Thailand&apos;s trade in prawns \u2013 known in the US as shrimp \u2013 in an imminent report that could result in economic sanctions against Bangkok. The state department has confirmed it intends to review the country&apos;s response to abuses such as migrants being bought by shipowners and forced to work as slaves for years at sea without pay. The review, expected in the middle of this month, could result in Thailand being downgraded to the lowest level in a US system that ranks 188 nations according to their willingness and efforts to combat slavery and human trafficking. A relegation to tier three could trigger economic sanctions and loss of development aid, although such punishments can be waived under certain national security considerations. &quot;We are aware of the Guardian investigation,&quot; said Luis CdeBaca, Washington&apos;s Ambassador-at-Large for monitoring and combatting trafficking in persons, in a statement. &quot;We are currently finalising the 2014 Trafficking in Persons report, which will be released later this month, and will include an overview of human trafficking in Thailand and the Thai government&apos;s efforts to address human trafficking.&quot; The annual Trafficking in Persons (TiP) report is considered to be the gold standard in global anti-trafficking efforts. Last year Thailand narrowly escaped relegation for the third year running and was told it would face an automatic downgrade this year if significant progress was not made to address issues of slavery and trafficking within its borders by the end of the year. Last year, for the third year running, Thailand narrowly escaped relegation and was told it would face an automatic downgrade this year if significant progress was not made to address issues of slavery and trafficking within its borders by the end of the year. &quot;Under US law there is a time limit how many years a country can stay on the tier-2 watch list before it is automatically downgraded to tier 3,&quot; said former US trafficking ambassador Mark Lagon, now a professor at Georgetown University. &quot;If the US government determines that Thailand has made improvements it can be raised up, but if it has not, there is no longer an opportunity to have any waivers or delay.&quot; Lagon said Thailand was at a &quot;critical juncture&quot; with the annual report due to be released within days and the country facing international &quot;moral opprobrium&quot; for receiving the lowest possible ranking. He also paid tribute to The Guardian&apos;s six month investigation into the Thai fishing industry, which uncovered horrific conditions, 20-hour shifts, regular beatings, torture and execution-style killings. Fifteen migrant workers from Burma and Cambodia described to the Guardian how they had been enslaved, after paying brokers to help them find work in Thailand in factories or on building sites. They were sold instead to boat captains, sometimes for as little as $420 (\u00a3250). &quot;As important as the work of governments and the UN are revelations brought to light by journalists,&quot; said Lagon. &quot;They do affect governments: creditworthiness, commerce, trust in the seafood coming out of Thailand will all be affected by this.&quot; Although slavery is illegal everywhere in the world, including Thailand, the south-east Asian country is considered a major source, transit and destination country for slavery, where nearly half a million people are believed to be enslaved, according to the Global Slavery Index. A tier-3 ranking would rank Thailand alongside Iran, North Korea and Saudi Arabia for categorically failing to comply with the most basic international requirements to prevent trafficking and protect victims. A downgrade could also lead to restrictions on US foreign assistance and access to global institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.

A recent article on the blog Africa is a Country demonstrated that &quot;the covers of most novels &apos;about Africa&apos; seem to have been designed by someone whose principal idea of the continent comes from The Lion King&quot; - reducing it, no matter the subject, geographical area or writer, to an acacia tree and a sunset. This followed a Twitterstorm triggered by a tweet from SimonMStevens:    Like so many (wildly varying) writers on Africa, Adichie gets the acacia tree sunset treatment... (@AfricasaCountry) pic.twitter.com/zMQtirfrQ9&mdash; Simon Stevens (@SimonMStevens) May 7, 2014    Stevens, a PhD candidate in international history at Columbia University, explained: &quot;I was browsing in the university bookshop here at Columbia last month when I noticed a display of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie&apos;s Half of a Yellow Sun. (...) The image of the acacia trees silhouetted against the orange sunset seemed strikingly familiar, so when I got home I spent a bit of time playing around on Goodreads and it soon became apparent how common a trope this was.&quot;  &quot;Of course not all or even most books set in Africa have this imagery on the cover \u2013 as people have repeatedly felt the need to point out to me since I first tweeted this! \u2013 but what caught my attention was the variety of books with this cover trope that I had turned up in a very brief search,&quot; he said. What struck him was the fact that &quot;in so many of the books that particular imagery bears so little relationship to the content. The books in the collage I put together are wildly varying: they&apos;re set in Botswana, the Congo, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, and range from the colonial adventure stories of Rider Haggard and the airport pulp fiction of Wilbur Smith, to the works of winners of the Nobel Prize for Literature like JM Coetzee, Nadine Gordimer, Doris Lessing, and Wole Soyinka.&quot; A recent piece in The Atlantic pointed out that &quot;what makes the persistence of these tired and inaccurate images even worse is that we&apos;re living in an era of brilliant book design (including this lovely, type-only cover for Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s Americanah).&quot; But this trend doesn&apos;t only affect books about Africa. There are other examples, such as the obsession with veils on Arabic literature, as denounced by M Lynx Qualey on her blog Arabic Literature, where she cites a talk by academic Adam Talib: &quot;Publishers, Talib said, can sometimes package books for bigots. This packaging might be one reason why readers leap to particular conclusions about an author\u2019s narrative. On the other hand, Talib added, he doesn\u2019t necessarily &apos;blame&apos; the publishers, as he also wants to get translated Arabic literature out to a wide audience, and this might be one way to do it.&quot;     Photograph: @saramsalem    This sparked the appearance of other examples on Twitter, such as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie&apos;s UK editions, &quot;soulful-black-woman-with-colourful-smudges&quot;:    .@SimonMStevens @AfricasaCountry See also soulful-black-woman-with-colourful-smudges e.g. UK pb eds of Adichie&#39;s bks. pic.twitter.com/bt7kUcaP06&mdash; Alice Kewellhampton (@aliceluciekh) May 7, 2014    We&apos;ve got another example from a reader who recently spotted a new phenomenon in English-language publishing in southeast Asia.

Scores of workers toiled feverishly to process mountains of shrimp for export to the US and EU. Most had been trafficked to the facility from nearby Burma and Cambodia. They toiled like automatons, processing shrimp around the clock. The workers were exhausted and malnourished, and almost all were kept in a state of debt bondage, with most of their &quot;wages&quot; deducted for exorbitant room, board and other expenses. One worker showed me his cramped, blistered fingers and said: &quot;My hands pain [me] so much, but I must work like a machine or the guards will beat me.&quot; Such is the reality for tens of millions of workers at the bottom of the global economy&apos;s supply chains. Most individuals are exploited in brutal working conditions and paid paltry wages. In the worst cases, the workers are exploited in conditions of outright slavery. They are beaten, abused, tortured or worse. The underbelly of the global economy has become a dark, brutish realm in which under-regulated labour markets provide minimised production costs for dozens of commodities exported around the world. Nowadays, you can traffic someone any distance, and at minimal cost, inside a day \u2013 generating thousands, tens of thousands \u2013 or, in the case of sex-trafficking, hundreds of thousands \u2013 of dollars a year for each slave. In the International Labour Organisation&apos;s May 2014 report, Profit and Poverty: The Economics of Forced Labour, it is estimated that $150bn (\u00a3892m) in profits is generated annually from forced labour. Hundreds of billions of dollars more are generated by child labourers and other workers who are exploited in severely harmful and abusive conditions. On average, a forced labourer generates about $8,000 profit annually for his or her exploiters. I calculate the average one-off cost of a slave today is $450. The transformation of the global slave trade from a high-cost, slow-recruitment business to a low-cost, rapid-recruitment one is driving criminal interest in trafficking and slavery, which is why it is permeating every corner of the global economy. These profits feed into every level of a commodity&apos;s supply chain \u2013 from the local factory owner, to the middlemen and wholesalers, all the way to retailers in developed economies seeking to be competitive on price for consumers who demand the lowest cost possible. The vulnerable and desperate of the world have become an expendable sub-class of people whose labour is extracted in slave-like conditions in order to feed cheap goods \u2013 from seafood and rice to tea and coffee, minerals and apparel to mobile phones and commercial sex \u2013 into the global economy. That slavery continues almost three centuries after the first attempts to eliminate it represents a catastrophic failure of capitalism and civilisation. Human rights, reason, justice and fairness have little meaning for the most vulnerable and desperate, who are chewed up and spat out by the global economy. What would a system free of these abuses look like? Is it even possible? I believe it is, subject to certain conditions. First, specially trained research teams must document the production base of each commodity through every level of its supply chain. This will reveal the extent to which supply is tainted by slavery and child labour. The first model of this process was outlined in a report I published through Harvard University, Tainted Carpets: Slavery and Child Labour in India&apos;s Handmade Carpet Sector. A multi-stakeholder team consisting of industry, government, academics and NGOs could then use this data to craft a response focused on eliminating slave-like labour from the supply chain on a reliable and sustained basis. Elements of an effective response would differ from one commodity to another, but a necessary constant would be a system of independent, third-party certification. To provide reliable and independent certification, these systems would need to be designed on a commodity-specific basis. Some such certification regimes exist, but few \u2013 if any \u2013 go beyond the first tier or two of a supply chain, or are properly independent. Governments and industry would have to support these efforts, and academics and NGOs would need to assist with design, as well as monitoring and measuring results. Once reliable certification and product labelling were in place, consumers could make enlightened choices to purchase goods untainted by slavery, child labour, or other forms of extreme exploitation. Next, industry would need to invest in the development, education, health and security of the communities whose low-cost labour they source. Doing so would help mitigate vulnerability to being trafficked and exploited. Industry has every right to avail itself of less expensive labour pools, but that right is accompanied by an obligation to invest in those communities, mitigating their impoverishment and vulnerability. With these and other efforts, we could achieve a more ethical and sustainable global economy. Consumers may have to pay slightly more for certain goods, and multinational corporations may have to accept slightly lower profits. But a freer and fairer labour environment would promote greater productivity, potentially offsetting some of those expenses. For the past quarter of a century, the global economy has brought many benefits to the world through greater flows in goods, capital and people. But the poorest of the poor have increasingly become an exploited labour class toiling in murky factories, mines and fields to feed our insatiable appetites. In this way, we are all shareholders in a system of slavery found in numerous global supply chains. We must ask ourselves how much longer we will look the other way while millions toil in slave-like conditions to provide us with the goods and services we consume. \u2022 Siddharth Kara is the author of Bonded Labour: Tackling the System of Slavery in South Asia, and directs the programme on human trafficking and modern slavery at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.

Along with Neymar, Messi and Ronaldo was Keisuke Honda. Asian players being used to promote global corporations elsewhere in Asia is worthy of note but this was not down to Honda being Asian but Honda being good. Despite that and the growing number of counterfeit Japanese and South Korean shirts on display in Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur markets, it is still largely true that plenty of football fans in Asia don\u2019t really follow Asian teams, preferring to support the big boys. Perhaps these next few weeks can show that the two are not mutually exclusive. If this summer produces a feeling that in the not-too-distant future that the best of the continent is capable of challenging the best in the world then perhaps, just perhaps, talk of the Asian Century will apply to football as well. Japan arrive in Brazil as the strongest team that Asia has ever sent to a World Cup. There are flaws but there is plenty to like, not least the trinity of Shinji Kagawa, Honda and Shinji Okazaki \u2013 the continent\u2019s most in-form forward coming off the back of a 15-goal Bundesliga season. Add full-backs that bomb forward and a midfield that moves the ball with swift fluidity and you can almost forget the defensive issues. Lapses of concentration and composure at the back are making it ever harder to predict what will happen as a crazy 4-3 win over Zambia showed last week. There are still expectations at home \u2013 a recent poll had almost 70% forecasting an extended stay with 18% fancying the last four \u2013 as there were ahead of a 2006 tournament that ended in failure. This is a better team with a better coach, though like Zico eight years ago, Alberto Zaccheroni has been accused of being overly loyal to his group of Asian Cup-winning players. Regardless, for the first time, the message coming out of the entire camp, including the Japan FA, is one of confidence ahead of the coming tests. Second round would be satisfactory, but quarter-finals would be undoubted success. First, though, Ivory Coast, Colombia and Greece provide an interesting rather than intimidating challenge to a team that has been guilty of giving European and, especially South American, opposition, too much respect in the past. Japan should get out of this open group providing that an out-of-touch Honda finds his form. Then the Samurai Blue need a first victory against one of the big boys in a competitive game \u2013 any of England, Italy or Uruguay, all past champions, will do \u2013 for progression in more than one sense of the word. South Korea did it in 2002 but would settle for a third appearance in the knockout stage out of four 21st century appearances. The coach, Hong Myung-bo, the captain of the 2002 semi-finalists, took the job last July and while the 45 year-old has never led a club, the \u2018Eternal Libero\u2019 has taken the Under-20 team to the quarter-finals of the 2009 World Cup and the Under-23 team to bronze at the 2012 London Olympics. Many of those graduates are now preparing for the biggest test of all \u2013against Russia, Algeria and Belgium. Boosted by the draw, expectations are high there too \u2013 a Seoul poll had 80% predicting the knockout stage \u2013 though World Cup fever is not. There will be no huge public-viewing parties that have been a bright-red staple of the capital and other major cities for the past three tournaments. The country is still coming to terms with the anguish of April\u2019s Sewol ferry disaster and there are still victims unaccounted for. Hong wants Asia\u2019s youngest representatives to make the country feel a little better. Nobody knows which South Korea will turn up in Brazil \u2013 they almost did not at all after a poor qualification campaign that saw the team use 45 players, more than all of the qualifiers except Argentina. Could it be the version that has the two wide men, Son Heung-min and Lee Chung-yong, driving forward with speed and skill and the cultured Ki Sung-yeung pulling the strings from deep? Or the one with a toothless attack and a defence terrified of set pieces? Japan may struggle in this regard but South Korea are on a whole other level. Behind closed doors of a training camp in Miami, the team has rolled up its sleeves to work on this vice again and again. Unlike the two east Asian rivals, Iran are stronger at the back than in attack and playing Team Melli could be an exercise in frustration for Nigeria, Argentina and Bosnia. Despite a lack of friendly games (it took almost nine months from qualification to arrange the first against Guinea on March), for all kinds of reasons \u2013 political, economic and even the occasional football one \u2013 the coach, Carlos Queiroz, has his men well-organised and happy to sit very deep and allow possession but no space in their half of the field. The country is mad for football, certainly more than its fellow AFC representatives, something that has always attracted and unnerved the powers-that-be. Just what would happen in Tehran if the captain Javad Nekounam can lead the team to the second round for the first time and/or beat Argentina \u2013 not even China\u2019s World Cup panda pundits could predict that. After qualifying for the 1998 World Cup the heroes were told to delay their return home from Australia by three days as celebrations, with members of both sexes out on the street, in the capital were getting out of hand. Defeating Messi and co has the potential to shock both the football and real world. It is unfair and tiresome for Iranian fans to keep hearing about politics when they are looking forward to a fourth World Cup but at least the players have a chance to ensure that mentions of Iran in international headlines over the next few weeks are not all in connection with sanctions, Syria or nuclear programmes. Australia rarely gets such global column inches but getting out of a group containing Spain, Holland and Chile would change all that. The draw may not be the disaster it seems. All knew that there was need for some serious transition work on a squad that was the second oldest in 2010 and had changed little before the arrival of the new coach Ange Postecoglou in October 2013. The only question was whether it should happen pre or post Brazil. Such a tough group has made it much easier for Postecoglou, highly rated at home but yet to show what he can do internationally, to start the process and the only genuine golden generation survivors are Tim Cahill and Mark Bresciano after Lucas Neill and Mark Schwarzer recently joined their fellow 2006 heroes Harry Kewell, Mark Viduka and Brett Emerton into the Socceroo history books. Despite the opposition and expectations, the 2014 World Cup is unlikely to be pointless for the country, either in terms of results or experience for a young group of players. Sometimes it is better not to stick with what you know and feel comfortable with, despite the best attempts of international fast food companies to persuade you otherwise. The AFC foursome can not only force the world to think again when it comes to Asian football, they can show Asian fans a thing or two.

Migrants began streaming across the border last week after the Thai army spokeswoman, Sirichan Ngathong, called illegal labourers a threat to Thailand and said anyone found without papers would be arrested and deported. Official Thai statistics show that more than 2 million documented migrant labourers work in Thailand, the vast majority of whom are Burmese, Cambodian and Lao. There are no official figures for those who work in Thailand without papers, but some activists claim that as many as 200,000 Cambodians may be working illegally \u2013 nearly the same as the number of people who have fled back to Cambodia in the past few days, according to Cambodian officials. The exodus has sparked anger in Cambodia, where government officials have called on the Thai military \u2013 which seized power in a bloodless coup on 22 May \u2013 to assume responsibility for the migration and its consequences. &quot;The army has rushed to deport workers who are considered illegal without prior notice or discussion with Cambodia, or at least making contact with provinces along the borders,&quot; Cambodia&apos;s interior minister, Sar Kheng, was quoted by Reuters as saying. &quot;The current Thai army leadership must be held responsible for all the problems that have occurred, including the loss of life.&quot; The migrants were likely to have been spurred on by unverified reports of killings and beatings at the hands of the Thai army, with the Cambodian Human Rights and Development Association (Adhoc) claiming to have &quot;credible witness accounts&quot; that nine migrants had been killed and many others beaten during deportations. Up to eight people were also allegedly killed last weekend, when a truck transporting migrants to the border overturned. While the Thai junta has denied any official crackdown and claims that the exodus back to Cambodia is voluntary and based on &quot;unfounded rumours&quot; of reprisals, it is still transporting migrants back to the Cambodian border in paid-for buses and Thai police cars. One Cambodian official also told Radio Free Asia&apos;s Khmer service that the Thai military had &quot;instructed private companies not to accept illegal migrants&quot;. Moun, a 27-year-old undocumented labourer who has spent the past seven years working in the construction and seafood industries in and around Bangkok, said he decided to flee after his friends warned him he was in danger. &quot;They said the army would arrest me if I got caught, and I was worried I would never get back home if that happened,&quot; he said as he piled his wife, baby and all their belongings \u2013 including a large toy car \u2013 on to a crowded bus filled with 200 other migrants heading for the Cambodian border town Poipet. &quot;I hope I can come back once the situation here gets better.&quot; Thai officials claim workers will be permitted to return once they receive legal work permits, which they must obtain from within their home countries. But with a once-booming Thai economy now on the brink of recession, it is not clear how many &quot;official&quot; jobs will be open to migrant workers. Labour-intensive industries such as construction, agriculture and seafood have long largely depended on migrant labour to fill jobs that Thais have eschewed for better-paid, easier work, but the junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha vowed last week to tighten laws regarding migrant workers and now aims to create &quot;economic zones&quot; along border areas, where migrants can be better controlled. &quot;We don&apos;t want foreign workers to be exploited by their employers,&quot; said Sihasak Phuanketkeow, Thailand&apos;s permanent secretary to the foreign ministry. A Guardian investigation last week into the Thai fishing industry, which is largely manned by Cambodian and Burmese migrant workers, found that some labourers were being press-ganged on to Thai fishing boats, where they were forced to work as modern-day slaves under horrific conditions in a $7.3bn (\u00a34.3bn) seafood industry that exports to the US, UK and EU. As part of an attempt to &quot;regulate&quot; Thailand&apos;s migrant labour population, the junta has vowed to register all foreign labourers within one year and claims that migrant workers in the fishing industry are a &quot;problem that must be urgently solved&quot;. The ongoing exodus is likely to have a profound impact on the hundreds of thousands of families who depended on migrant workers&apos; salaries back in Cambodia, where most people eke out a living as farmers and 20% of the population lives on less than $1.25 a day, according to World Bank figures. \u2022 Additional reporting by Nat Sumon", "publicationDate": "2014-06-18T13:39:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Cambodia", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/18/cambodia-thailand-migrant-labourers-border", "title": "Cambodia blames Thailand as 220,000 migrant labourers cross border", "sentences": ["Moun, a 27-year-old undocumented labourer who has spent the past seven years working in the construction and seafood industries in and around Bangkok, said he decided to flee after his friends warned him he was in danger."]}, {"article": "As chairman of Charoen Pokphand (CP) Foods, I want to confirm our position regarding Thai fishing boats supplying fish for the production of fishmeal to the feed mill industry, including CPF (The supermarket slave trail, 11 June). Through our research and development of alternative protein sources, CPF could walk away from fishmeal. However, doing so would shift the problem to the fishing industry, which is mostly comprised of fishermen earning their living in legal ways. The products of the fishing boats involved in human trafficking and slavery will continue to be purchased by other factories, and the issues around slavery will remain unchanged. I believe it is better to work within the system, using our buying power to eradicate slavery in the region and make fishing practices fully sustainable. While others talk about it, we are doing it. I confirm as follows: 1) We condemn all aspects of human trafficking and slavery. 2) Under my instruction, CPF has ceased buying fishmeal from suppliers suspected of obtaining bycatch from fishing boats involved in human trafficking or slavery. CPF will involve independent NGOs to routinely audit the legality of the sources of our suppliers. 3) We will conduct an audit on such suppliers to determine if they have been involved in illegal actions. We will stop purchasing meal from suppliers acquiring raw materials from fishing boats involved in human trafficking or slavery, until they can rectify illicit actions. 4) Even though our only link to the fishing industry is our purchase of fishmeal from independent fishmeal suppliers, which we use as a minor ingredient in our production of shrimp feed, CPF will\u00a0actively assist the relevant authorities in Thailand to strengthen the law enforcement against human trafficking and slavery involving the supply chain of fishmeal.

The money was for lobbying to persuade the White House, Congress and US departments of state and defence that Thailand is a country that fights human trafficking and forced labour. It seems not to have been money well spent. On Friday Thailand was downgraded to the lowest ranking in the state department&apos;s annual report on Trafficking in Persons. The money invested in lobbying therefore represents both a defeat and a serious embarrassment for the Thai authorities.           In truth though, it has looked in recent weeks like the Thais were resigned to this US condemnation. Earlier this month, Thailand was the only government to vote against ratifying a new treaty to stop forced labour drawn up by the UN&apos;s International Labour Organisation. A couple of days later days the law firm emailed a clarification on behalf of the Thai embassy \u2013 Thailand had voted against because it was not sure it could implement the treaty, but it would adopt it anyway. Bangkok&apos;s failure to get to grips with the gross exploitation of workers was laid bare in the recent Guardian investigation which found that slaves are being used on Thai fishing boats that serve the global prawn industry. Some of the revelations \u2013 summary executions, 20-hour days with no pay, men traded among boat owners like animals for a few hundred pounds \u2013 beggared belief. If US minds were not already made up, this was further convincing evidence in favour of a downgrade. The downgrading of countries that are American allies is always a subject of debate, however, according to former US anti-trafficking ambassador Mark Lagon. Behind the scenes US embassies in the countries&apos; and regional bureaus will have been arguing that the US has &quot;other equities than human rights&quot; in countries such as Thailand and Qatar, he said. Whether the US can afford to be candid about governments in turmoil and facing anti-coup demonstrations, such as Bangkok&apos;s, will also have been a factor. &quot;Clearly there will have been intense debate about whether Thailand or Qatar deserve a downgrade and questions around the valuable relationship the US has with its strategic partners,&quot; Lagon said. With such partners, economic sanctions that could be triggered by a tier 3 ranking are often waived, so that the impact comes instead from the attached moral stigma \u2013 particularly for a country like Thailand that openly promotes itself as a relaxed tourist destination. The downgrade will be seen as a &quot;confirmation of loss of face&quot; for the Thai government, says migrant rights expert Andy Hall, but it is important to note that this &quot;face [was] lost a while ago now&quot;. &quot;A tier 3 status for Thailand is called for as acknowledgement of the severity of the human trafficking situation in Thailand and failure of successive administrations to address the breakdown in rule of law and migration policy that have led to this poor situation,&quot; he says. The Thai government has issued numerous statements in the last week proclaiming its expectation for an upgrade, claiming that it has &quot;tackled the human trafficking problem&quot; in Thailand. As proof, it points to the creation of government task forces and higher prosecution and conviction rates than last year. But in its analysis of Thailand&apos;s anti-trafficking progress, the state department was just short of scathing. The report cites corruption &quot;at all levels&quot; as impeding significant headway and claims that anti-trafficking law enforcement remains insufficient compared with the overall scale of trafficking and slavery. It also states that, despite frequent media and NGO reports detailing instances of trafficking and slavery in sectors like the fishing industry, the government has &quot;systematically failed&quot; to investigate, prosecute or convict boat owners and captains, or even officials, complicit in the crimes. The document also describes &quot;credible reports&quot; of corrupt officials engaging in commercial sex acts with child trafficking victims, colluding with traffickers, and protecting brothels. And it pointed to separate criminal defamation suits filed against individuals like Andy Hall \u2013 who documented trafficking violations in a food processing factory \u2013 and two journalists who published excerpts of a report on the trafficking of Rohingya refugees (and the Thai Navy&apos;s alleged involvement), as possibly &quot;silencing&quot; other activists and media. The company identified by the Guardian as having slaves in its prawn supply chain, Charoen Pokphand Foods (CP), also moved this week to defend its position. Shares in Thai seafood companies had already fallen on the Thai stock exchange amid news that Europe&apos;s largest retailer, Carrefour, together with Norwegian supermarket chain Ica, has stopped purchasing its products added to pressure. CP&apos;s chairman Dhanin Chearavanont wrote publicly condemning &quot;all aspects of human trafficking and slavery&quot; and said he had personally instructed his company to stop buying fishmeal from suppliers suspected of sourcing from slave boats. He added that the company wanted to work with the Thai government and with independent NGOs to audit the supply chain and rid it of slavery. With powerful connections to top-level politicians in Thailand, and listed by Forbes as the country&apos;s wealthiest man, the billionaire&apos;s acknowledgement of the problem was seen as essential by local campaign groups to any real progress. Dhanin also met David Cameron in Downing Street last year, although the visit was not recorded in the prime minister&apos;s list of official meetings. Human rights activists remained sceptical that slavery would be tackled in the absence of clear details from the Thai government and the industry of what action they would take. Phil Robertson, deputy director, Asia Division, Human Rights Watch said: &quot;The Thai industry has looked the other way for so long on abuses in Thailand&apos;s fishing fleets that I expect corporate monitoring of supply chains will fall far short of what is needed unless truly independent NGOs and representatives of the migrant fishermen themselves are at the centre of those efforts. And even then, it will be hard \u2013 because the use of trafficked persons is systematic and pervasive in these fishing fleets and there has been little political commitment from the Thai government to clean it up.&quot; The International Transport Workers Federation (ITF) also argued that market-led solutions such as auditing and certification, which the Guardian found were often faked, would be inadequate on their own to eradicate abuse. &quot;Parts of this industrial model are predicated on modern slavery and we must work to pick this apart. It is critical that there is an immediate response from companies and that it includes respect for fundamental workers&apos; rights such as freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining,&quot; Liz Blackshaw leader of the ITF programme on fisheries said. In a statement the Thai government said it disagreed with the state department&apos;s decision but would continue to fight against trafficking. &quot;In 2013, Thailand made significant advances in prevention and suppression of human trafficking along the same lines as the state department&apos;s standards,&quot; it said. &quot;While the latest TiP report did not recognise our vigorous, government-wide efforts that yielded unprecedented progress and concrete results, Thailand remains committed to combating human trafficking. It is a national priority.

This is, it&apos;s not unfair to say, an unusual combination. Storm grew up in a tough, working-class coastal Danish town. His alcoholic father left home, his stepfather beat him and he committed his first armed robbery at 13. There followed multiple expulsions, special schools and a promising career as a boxer curtailed by indiscipline. By his mid teens, he was involved in a local street gang mainly composed of local Palestinian, Turks and Iranian immigrants. &quot;I gravitated to [them]. I felt like an outsider in Korsor and I always identified with the underdog,&quot; he says early in this fascinating account of a decade or so spent inside both militant Sunni Muslim activism and security services&apos; counterterrorism. Leaving the neighbourhood street toughs, Storm graduated to the Bandidos, a biker gang, and enjoyed much violence, casual sex and drugs. At the age of 21, in 1997, however, he found a biography of the prophet Muhammad in a local library. The &quot;dignity and simplicity&quot; of Muhammad&apos;s life appealed to Storm, as did &quot;his story of battling the odds, fighting for a cause&quot;; the cause also brought with it &quot;a sense of solidarity and loyalty&quot;. The gangster declared himself a Muslim and enjoyed the comradeship of other Muslims he knew from the neighbourhood. None of them took the\u00a0strictures of faith very seriously or\u00a0knew many of its teachings. They celebrated his conversion by going on\u00a0a\u00a0drinking binge. But another bout of jail \u2013 and exposure to much more rigorous and radicalised Muslims behind bars \u2013 hardened Storm&apos;s Islamic faith and changed his perception of the world beyond Demark. When he fled to London to avoid angry members of his former gang, he ended up in Regent&apos;s Park mosque; then he was offered a Saudi-funded scholarship to study Arabic and his new faith at an ultra-conservative religious school in Yemen. He accepted and this first journey to the Middle East marked the real start of his extraordinary journey through 15 years of extremism in Britain, Denmark and the Yemen. Accounts of &quot;My Time in al-Qaida&quot; are numerous enough for them to constitute a sub-genre, but there are no others in which the main protagonist has also played such an extensive role for western security services, and, more crucially, is prepared to reveal so much. Tim Lister and Paul Cruickshank, the two CNN journalists who have written the book with Storm, have done a fine job of giving context to his extraordinary story and appear to have tested much of his account. The result is a credible narrative that illuminates both violent Islamic extremism and the intelligence community&apos;s efforts to fight it. Neither the Islamists nor the spooks come out of it particularly well. After learning Arabic and soaking up the teachings of some of the most conservative contemporary Islamic thinkers, Storm left Yemen for the UK. This was the end of the 1990s and London was home to many exiled radicals calling for violence overseas. The Danish convert quickly found new friends, some of whom went on to commit terrorist acts, and he spent time with Omar Bakri Mohammed Fostok, the leader of the Al-Muhajiroun group. British activism existed on the very margins \u2013 cultural, political, social \u2013 of mainstream society. Staying in grubby flats in run-down council estates, living off welfare and petty (or occasionally more serious) crime, Storm and his associates inhabited a world of overstayed visas, violent online videos, idolised preachers, frustration and alienation. Throughout the book, militant activism is revealed to be amateurish but nonetheless a threat. While the Islamic societies and the links between the brothers created a surrogate family or &quot;fictive kin&quot;, and were a form of cultish &quot;closed society&quot;, they were also connected to a global network of contacts who shared an ideology and a purpose. Storm&apos;s own credentials as a militant were reaffirmed continually by his apparent closeness to well-known activists and ideologues. The most prominent of these, and a central character in his account, is Anwar al-Awlaki, a charismatic US-born radical cleric of Yemeni origins who would eventually be regarded as second only to Osama bin Laden in posing the greatest threat to western security. Al-Awlaki, the son of a senior figure in a major local tribe, invited Storm to dinner when the young Danish convert was back in Yemen in early 2006, and impressed him greatly. Even so, Storm was beginning to doubt the message. He was troubled by what he saw as an incoherence within Islam on the question of free will and predestination. According to Agent Storm, however, his biggest problem was presented by the indiscriminate violence of the movement. He &quot;began to reconsider some of the justifications for the killing and maiming of civilians&quot;, he writes. &quot;Now I thought of the twin towers, Bali, Madrid in 2004, London in 2005 \u2026 If they were part of Allah&apos;s preordained plan, I now wanted no part of it. My loss of faith was as frightening as it was sudden.&quot; Storm was not alone, and Lister and Cruickshank miss an opportunity to point out that tens of millions of people across the Islamic world, including very many who had been broadly sympathetic to the aims of the\u00a0extremists in the period following the US and British invasion of Iraq, were having the same doubts. From Morocco to Malaysia, levels of support that were high in 2004 or 2005 had declined by 2007. Both MI5 and PET, the Danish intelligence service, had previously attempted to recruit Storm, with no success. Having repudiated his former &quot;brothers&quot;, he dug out a card with a number on it and called. From here on, the narrative gathers pace, becoming a spy thriller written in spy-thriller prose. Detailed accounts by participants of how western intelligence agencies attempted to kill major al-Qaida figures are rare, and Storm&apos;s descriptions of meetings, training sessions and discussions are revelatory. He recounts a series of episodes working as an informant for MI5 (back to the dingy flats and the mosques), for PET in Denmark and, eventually, for the CIA. Storm&apos;s portrayal of the spooks is unflattering. From the philandering, flashy, hard-drinking PET, to the stand\u2011offish, rule-obsessed Brits, to the arrogant, wealthy CIA, no one comes out well. The degree to which the agencies conform to national stereotype is jarring, but his account of the lavish post-mission &quot;debriefing&quot; sessions with Danish handlers in luxury hotels in Bangkok and Lisbon is nonetheless more than plausible. Indeed, much has subsequently been confirmed by internal official inquiries in Denmark. Storm, astonishingly, taped meetings with the CIA by leaving his iPhone recording and this material, too, corroborates his story. His relationship with all the agencies eventually fell apart after the CIA set out to kill Al-Awlaqi. The cleric&apos;s vehicle was destroyed by a missile fired from an unmanned drone in September 2011. Storm claims that a flash drive he delivered to Al-Awlaqi led the Americans to their target. The CIA denied this and Storm lost out on a promised $5m reward. He had fallen out with MI5 and MI6 long before, in part because they suspected he had become involved in an assassination attempt, something prohibited by UK law. His relationship with the PET ended in acrimony too, as he went public with his story. Storm repeatedly insists that he was led into radical Islamic violence by a &quot;quest to fight for the underdog&quot;. Equally important, perhaps, was his desire to be one of the team, to be liked, even to be admired by the gangsters, the aspirant militants in the UK, the hardened networks in the Arab Peninsula and the security services. Terrorism is less a matter of faceless organisations than a social activity \u2013 one which, in nature if not purpose or justification, is much like any other. \u2022 To order Agent Storm for \u00a313.59 with free UK p&amp;p call Guardian book service on 0330 333 6846 or go to guardianbookshop.co.uk.", "publicationDate": "2014-07-02T08:29:00Z", "tags": ["Politics", "UK security and counter-terrorism", "UK news", "Books", "Al-Qaida", "Denmark", "World news", "Culture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/02/agent-storm-al-qaeda-morten-storm-review", "title": "Agent Storm: My Life Inside al-Qaeda by Morten Storm \u2013 review", "sentences": ["The degree to which the agencies conform to national stereotype is jarring, but his account of the lavish post-mission &quot;debriefing&quot; sessions with Danish handlers in luxury hotels in Bangkok and Lisbon is nonetheless more than plausible."]}, {"article": "The first low-cost transatlantic flights since Freddie Laker&apos;s doomed Skytrain enterprise has left Gatwick airport for Los Angeles, a development that Gatwick describes a &quot;game-changer&quot; in the debate over where to build a new runway in London. As well as the twice-weekly service to LA, Norwegian will operate two flights a week to Fort Lauderdale, where the majority of the cabin crew will be based, while a London-New York service has its first flight on Thursday. The new operation from Norwegian Air Shuttle has attracted controversy, particularly in the United States, for taking advantage of differing international legislation to circumvent labour costs and buy aircraft on more favourable terms than competitors. Consumers will also struggle to find a seat at the advertised cheapest fares, on the relatively few long-haul services that Norwegian runs. Only seven of its 95 planes are capable of transatlantic flights. Norwegian will run a service pitched somewhere between the low-cost European model and traditional transatlantic carriers, with seat-back entertainment included but food and luggage incurring extra charges. The airline&apos;s chief executive, Bj\u00f8rn Kos, said: &quot;At Norwegian, we believe that everyone should be able to afford to fly. In order to compete in the global airline industry you need to adapt to changes and keep a constant focus on cost. &quot;Norwegian has a low-cost model, meaning a lean administration, brand new and fuel-efficient aircraft and efficient operations. We fly direct routes with high passenger demand and choose centrally located airports such at Gatwick that share our mindset.&quot; Kos says costs have been driven down by the fuel efficiency of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane. The airline, which already operates similar services between Thailand, Scandinavia and the US, has come under fire in Norway and elsewhere for employing crew in Bangkok on Singaporean contracts. Unions have accused Norwegian of undermining labour conventions, with the ITF likening its pursuit of operating licences to the shipping practice of registering vessels under flags of convenience. Norwegian said it established its long-haul company in Dublin for its air traffic rights as an EU nation and to maintain export guarantees to finance its fleet orders, and that the airline fully complies with European safety standards. Pilots union Balpa said concerns remained, although a ruling in the US has prevented Norwegian from using pilots from Bangkok on the new Gatwick routes. Balpa said: &quot;The use of European pilots on this new route will reassure passengers who may otherwise have been concerned about an airline associated with a particular country by name which is in fact cherry-picking another country to oversee its safety standards and yet another to employ its pilots.&quot; For Gatwick, however, the Norwegian long-haul launch is a milestone in its battle for expansion. Its chief executive, Stewart Wingate, said: &quot;A low-cost carrier flying to the Big Apple for a small price shows how fast aviation is changing and highlights one of a series of future trends that will have a huge bearing on the UK&apos;s runways debate.&quot; The airport unveiled a new report by independent aviation consultant Chris Tarry, which set out how the latest generation of aircraft could affect London airport expansion, with a fuel economy, size and range that lowers the need for connecting passengers and opens up the development of low-cost long-haul services. Tarry&apos;s report says Gulf expansion would also lower the demand for connections in a London hub, but he believes that traffic will grow due to the strength of the capital as a destination in its own right. Wingate added: &quot;As this new report outlines, it is the airlines&apos; fleet plans and order books of today that hold the key to the expansion needs of tomorrow. New generation aircraft and other key trends will lead to a reduction in &apos;hub&apos; connecting traffic, an increase in point-to-point services and the continued growth of low-cost carriers, all of which are cornerstones of Gatwick&apos;s case for a second runway.&quot; He added: &quot;Heathrow&apos;s plans are yesterday&apos;s solution to tomorrow&apos;s problem and that only expansion of Gatwick can meet the challenges and demands of the future.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-07-02T15:29:15Z", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Business", "London", "UK news", "Heathrow third runway", "Travel and transport", "Heathrow", "Air transport", "Environment", "Norway", "Europe", "World news", "US news", "Los Angeles", "California", "New York"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/02/norwegian-low-cost-transatlantic-flight-gatwick-la", "title": "Norwegian's low-cost transatlantic service takes off from Gatwick", "sentences": ["The airline, which already operates similar services between Thailand, Scandinavia and the US, has come under fire in Norway and elsewhere for employing crew in Bangkok on Singaporean contracts.", "Pilots union Balpa said concerns remained, although a ruling in the US has prevented Norwegian from using pilots from Bangkok on the new Gatwick routes."]}, {"article": "Art has a special relationship with money. As the latest art sales show, contemporary art is a coveted luxury item. It is collected by people who have supervillain yachts and help to fund the Tory party. Can today&apos;s plutocrat art say anything about poverty? Artist Phil America (yes he&apos;s American) has had a go. Recently, America moved to Klong Toey, Thailand&apos;s largest slum, and employed a local carpenter to create him a &quot;typical&quot; slum dwelling \u2013 a tiny one-room shack. He lived in it and &quot;interacted&quot; with fellow slum-dwellers. The resulting work, Slum Vacation, has been shown at the art gallery of Bangkok University. The shack in which America lived and its contents were on view in an installation at the gallery, together with photos and sounds of the slums. The university is close to Klong Toey, and the event is said to have broken down cultural barriers between the academic community and its neighbours. Yet the limitations of Slum Vacation seem all too apparent. Reproducing a &quot;slum house&quot; in a gallery turns poverty into spectacle. The way people live has been aestheticised here as an object of curiosity to contemplate. The fact that Phil America lived in the shack himself and experienced life in Klong Toey only adds to the work&apos;s clumsiness. It becomes an image of the heroic artist bravely stepping out of his life to experience the other side of existence. His artwork is not a portrait of the people of Klong Toey: it is a self-portrait of the artist having an exotic adventure. Slum Vacation so obviously risks making poverty into entertainment and the artist into a hero as he literally slums it. Come on. How can this stand up as a serious representation of, let alone intervention in, the lives of the poor? Only that title, Slum Vacation, shows a more subtle understanding of how hard it is for artists to make a meaningful social statement. With its echo of the Dead Kennedys song Holiday in Cambodia, it acknowledges the absurdity of the project, the impossibility of truly &quot;experiencing&quot; poverty as an outsider \u2013 let alone communicating it to others. If this work fails to address inequality, is there any art now that does do it justice? I see more depth in the work of Santiago Sierra. He makes conceptual art that seriously addresses poverty, often paying people from impoverished, exploited groups \u2013 for example migrants \u2013 to participate in his works. These disturbing performances draw attention to their own means of production. It&apos;s provocative, and a lot more real than a slum house displayed in a gallery. Even so, the contradictions are agonising for artists today who want to be socially engaged, for any image of poverty in the moneyed art of our time risks looking about as socially realistic as an 18th-century porcelain figure of a happy swain.", "publicationDate": "2014-07-07T14:35:16Z", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Culture", "Performance art", "Installation", "Poverty"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/jul/07/slum-vacation-plutocrat-art-poverty-phil-america", "title": "The artist who took a 'slum vacation' to Thailand's biggest shanty town", "sentences": ["The resulting work, Slum Vacation, has been shown at the art gallery of Bangkok University."]}, {"article": "A historic presidential election in Indonesia was precariously balanced on Wednesdayafter both candidates declared themselves winners, raising the prospect of a tense standoff in the Islamic world&apos;s biggest democracy. Just hours after the polls closed, Joko Widodo, the governor of Jakarta who has made the fight against corruption and social injustice key policies, gave a live television address claiming victory, setting off scenes of jubilation among his supporters. &quot;We are grateful that based on the counting of the quick counts, Jokowi-JK has won,&quot; he said, referring to his own nickname and the initials of his running mate, Jusuf Kalla. He cited one of the early post-election counts, which samples votes from around the country and which gave him about 52% of vote compared with about 48% for his rival, Prabowo Subianto, an ex-general and son-in-law of the former dictator Suharto. &quot;This is the victory of all people of Indonesia,&quot; Jokowi later told supporters. Another credible quick count by the pollster Saiful Mujani with similar figures gave Jokowi 52.95% and Prabowo 47.05%. But his opponent was in no mood to concede, appearing on television later to say: &quot;We are grateful from the incoming data that we received the mandate of the people.&quot; Numerous quick counts cited on television channels showed significant variations in result, depending on the political affiliation of the TV channel. The quick counts conducted by the Centre for Policy Studies and the Indonesia Voice Network, put Prabowo in front by 1% to 4%. Political analyst Yohanes Sulaiman said: &quot;I think basically we are going to be in limbo. Are you actually willing to tell Prabowo to his face: &apos;Hey, you are wrong&apos;?&quot; Prabowo, who was dismissed from the Indonesian army special forces for ordering the kidnapping of pro-democracy activists in 1998, is known to have a short\u00a0temper. His supporters admire him for his firmness, arguing that Indonesia, a nation strung across 17,000 islands and home to hundreds of ethnic groups and cultures, needs a strong, unifying leader. Other analysts believe the dual claim could end up in a long drawn-out constitutional battle that is unlikely to be resolved for months. The elections are seen as a crucial test of democracy in the world&apos;s fourth most populous country, as they should result in Indonesia&apos;s first democratic transfer of power from one elected leader to another. Indonesia has offered a respectable example, in recent years, of a Muslim-majority country that threw off dictatorship and blossomed economically under a democratic system. On his official Twitter account, the outgoing president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who has publicly endorsed Prabowo, urged for peace to be preserved. He asked both camps to &quot;restrain themselves and not to mass on the streets to celebrate, until an official KPU [election commission] announcement&quot;. Yudhoyono repeated his comments several hours later, adding that the conflicting counts did not qualify as the &quot;official results&quot;. Authorities said up to 250,000 police officers were on standby across the country and while there are fears that the conflicting declarations could cause unrest, as of Wednesday evening there were no reported incidents. Before the election several credible pollsters had placed Jokowi ahead of Prabowo, but maintained that the race was too close to call. At the polls, voters appeared to be equally divided over their choice of the next president. Voting preferences were more pronounced across demographic lines. First-time voters, who account for a third of the 187 million electorate, tended to favour Jokowi. Anis Komariah, 28, commenting on Jokowi&apos;s reputation for clean governance as she voted in south Jakarta, said: &quot;He is the type of person that is sincere, and the parties that support him, he didn&apos;t offer them ministerial positions.&quot; Young voters, who have taken to social media in huge numbers during the election \u2013 at one point on Wednesday six out of 10 top trending hashtags worldwide referred to Indonesia&apos;s election \u2013 believe that Jokowi represents a clean break with the past. Older voters who are likely to have vivid memories of the mass riots that led to the fall of Suharto in 1998, say they favour Prabowo, seeing him as a strong, commanding leader who they believed would better unify the country. Rofiq Mohammad, a 48-year-old voter, said: &quot;I think a strong leader is important because we don&apos;t want a situation like the Middle East. &quot;If things get unstable, everything will go bad and maybe so bad that it will be difficult to come back again. Indonesian stability is the most important.&quot; However, there appeared to be a consensus among voters in the world&apos;s third-largest democracy that the election should go ahead peacefully amid fears that riots could break out in the event of a tight or contested result. Official results are not expected for two weeks. Edward Gunawan, a film producer who flew home to Indonesia from Bangkok in the middle of a shoot so he could vote for the first time, said that in recent weeks selfies and pictures of food had vanished from his social media feeds. &quot;It&apos;s interesting that your news feed is suddenly filled with very serious stuff, but I see it as a very encouraging sign,&quot; said Gunawan, who likened the mood to the election of US president Barack Obama in 2008. &quot;My generation and even the younger generation are getting involved and getting excited about the political process.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-07-09T15:13:44Z", "tags": ["Indonesia", "Asia Pacific", "Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/09/jokowi-prabowo-both-claim-victory-indonesian-election", "title": "Jokowi and Prabowo both claim victory in early Indonesian election results", "sentences": ["Edward Gunawan, a film producer who flew home to Indonesia from Bangkok in the middle of a shoot so he could vote for the first time, said that in recent weeks selfies and pictures of food had vanished from his social media feeds."]}, {"article": "A burst of 10 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Researchers tests personal data market to find out how much your personal information is worth &gt;&gt; MIT Technology Review  In total, the team ran 596 auctions over 60 days and paid out a total of \u20ac262 in the form of Amazon vouchers to 29 participants. The median bid across all the data categories was \u20ac2. They also paid out \u20ac100 to one of the participants with the highest response rate who they chose using a raffle. The results clearly show that some information is more highly valued than others. &quot;We have found that location is the most valued category of personally identifiable information,&quot; say Staiano and co. And participants tended to value processed information more highly as well because of their perception that it gave a greater insight into their lifestyle. But interestingly personal information becomes even more highly valued in certain circumstances. For example, the study covered two unusual days. The first was a holiday in Italy known as the Immaculate Conception holiday. The second was a day of particularly high winds which caused multiple roadblocks and accidents. &quot;The median bids for all categories in these two days were significantly higher than for the rest of the days in the study,&quot; say Staiano and co. In other words, participants value their information more highly on days that are unusual compared to typical days.  \u20ac2 per day is over \u20ac700 annually. You can read the Arxiv paper.

Unbundling mobile apps for the emerging markets &gt;&gt; Lightspeed  I think unbundling is a strategy that has not yet been applied with vigor in the emerging markets on smartphones. I think there are potentially disproportionate advantages to be had by unbundling in countries like India, in the short- to medium-term. Why is this? Because low device memory limits (typically less than 16 Gb), low bandwidth limits (mostly 2G) and relatively high bandwidth prices result in dramatic drops in conversion rates, download success rates and retention rates as app size increases. Also, in my opinion, discovery on the app stores is easier when there is a single focused value prop (kind of the approach that Whatsapp has taken with a singular focus on messaging).  The graph of downloads against file size is persuasive. Tablet PC quarterly shipments fall for the first time, according to NPD DisplaySearch &gt;&gt; DisplaySearch  &quot;Tablet PC demand in 2014 is being affected by falling demand for the 7&quot; class in emerging regions and in China, where many local white-box brands have experienced lower-than-expected shipment growth,&quot; said Hisakazu Torii, vice president, smart application research at NPD DisplaySearch. &quot;Most major brands have recently reduced their business plans for 2014. There is a risk that the replacement cycle for tablet PCs will lengthen beyond the one to two year range unless brands can develop more attractive usage scenarios.&quot;  Forecasts declining notebook sales. The truth behind Apple&apos;s suppliers in China (Part 1) &gt;&gt; SonnyDickson  In Hua Qiang North Market, the heart of asia&apos;s electronics market, there is a building called YuanWang Digital Mall. There are dozens of iPhone 5 &amp; 6, iPads, and Macs such as Mac Mini&apos;s and Macbook&apos;s. These units vary from real, and fake units. All the real units and all their accessories are\u00a0 being showcased and traded throughout that mall, and later sold and distributed around the whole world. Almost all the goods there are smuggled goods from HK, due to 17% tax at China customs, so smuggling to avoid high tax is very very profitable. On May 27th, Shen Zhen Customs (Shenzhen anti-smuggling governing body), and Hua Qiang street authorities,\u00a0stormed the YuanWang Mall to try to catch some of those smugglers and whoever was said to sell Apple/Samsung/Nokia/etc units, or fake Apple/Samsung/Nokia units. More than 120 government officials are involved in this operation. Apple may have had a role in this raid, since Apple have the ability to track all serials &amp; activations between HK and China. There are 3 major smugglers and sellers who own 10 warehouses, 38 shops inside the mall, and around the area have been caught. During these operations more than 2 thousand people witnessed the whole raid, making it such a scene in the area.  A Statistical Comparison of the iOS and Android Stores &gt;&gt; ShinobiControls Website Colin Eberhardt:   A few months ago I published a blog post which showed the results of analysing the meta-data of 75,000 apps from the iTunes App Store. This analysis revealed some interesting results; 75% of apps are free, 60% have no ratings and the Entertainment category has the worst user ratings. This blog post continues the analysis by adding 60,000 Android apps into the mix. For those of you that like their information presented in tweet-sized portions, here are some quick results \u2022 The iOS store has 3.5x more business apps than the Android store, and 2x more Education apps.\u2022 Both stores have roughly the same number of free apps, at 75%\u2022 The most expensive category in the Android store is Medicine at $21 avg, which is double the most expensive iOS category, Business, with an average price of $12.\u2022 The average user rating of Android apps is slightly lower than iOS apps\u2022 The Apple store has 3x more apps with zero user ratings.  Would have been nice - with the Android apps (as it&apos;s not available for the iOS store) - would have been an analysis of the number of downloads. (Thanks @HotSoup for the link.) German court orders Motorola to stop selling top phones &gt;&gt; Cult of Android  A German court has ordered Motorola to stop selling selected smartphones in Germany to do a dispute over the design of their antennas. The company&apos;s flagship Moto X, Moto G, and other devices infringe a patent for &quot;Laser Direct Structuring&quot; that is owned by German engineering firm LPKF. &quot;On July 8, 2014, the Mannheim Regional Court ordered Motorola Deutschland and Motorola Mobility USA to refrain from selling cell phones in Germany that infringe the patent and ordered Motorola Deutschland to recall all cell phones that infringe the patent from commercial customers,&quot; LPKF said in a statement today.

Joy was the customer service person who helped me do this. Joy&apos;s notebook is about two inches thick, she&apos;s created an A-Z index for it, it is packed full of handwritten notes about how to do different tasks in the various system she uses \u2013 steps that need following, codes that need inputting. It sits beside her every day, beautifully decorated (with stickers) evidence of\u00a0the horrendous usability of the software she uses to get her job done. Joy has been working for this airline for\u00a0years. She told me that some of the stuff that is in her notebook\u00a0she doesn&apos;t need anymore \u2013 either because they&apos;ve upgraded to a new system or that, after years, she&apos;s finally managed to memorise it. She told me that each time they upgrade the system it seems to get harder, not easier, to use. Joy told me that all the customer service reps have a notebook like this. You can&apos;t use the systems without one. Joy is digitally literate and confident with the computer, but it is impossible to use without the notebook.

Stop the JerkTech &gt;&gt; TechCrunch Josh Constine:   &quot;Go disr*pt yourself&quot; is what I have to say to founders of startups like ReservationHop and Parking Monkey. They&apos;re emblematic of a compassionless new wave of self-serving startups that exploit small businesses and public infrastructure to make a buck and aid the wealthy. Let&apos;s call these parasites #JerkTech. It&apos;s one thing to outcompete a big, stagnant company with new technology. It&apos;s another to screw over the little guys just because you can sell what&apos;s usually free. So what do these tools do? ReservationHop places phony reservations at the hottest San Francisco restaurants, and then sells them for $5 or $10 apiece on its site. That makes it harder for the common man to get a reservation, since if they call the restaurant directly, they&apos;ll find all the spots taken. And if ReservationHop doesn&apos;t sell the spots it stole? Tough luck for the restaurant, which just had a table go empty or wasted a half hour because the fake Dick Jerkson that ReservationHop put as the name on the res never showed up.  How Microsoft stops your Windows Phone getting certain features &gt;&gt; Neowin  beyond the annoying limitations of carriers and the realities of software development, there is a further mechanism that can - and in some cases, does - restrict the availability of certain Windows Phone features in particular markets. Documentation seen by Neowin, shown to us\u00a0by a source at one of Microsoft&apos;s hardware partners, describes how OEMs must comply with &quot;Embargos&quot; set by Microsoft, which may prohibit or restrict distribution or announcement of certain features within the Windows Phone OS. For example, on WindowsPhone.com, Microsoft says that Wi-Fi\u00a0Sense\u00a0- a feature that allows users to automatically connect to wireless networks, and share Wi-Fi details with trusted contacts - &quot;is not available in the following countries/regions: Bangladesh, Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.&quot;  Not explained: why (beyond services that might just not be ready in some countries, eg Cortana/speech) Microsoft would do this. The spread of second-hand smartphones in Thailand/SE Asia &gt;&gt; Inside The Noodle Bowl Jon Russell went travelling and has some notes:   In no particular order: \u2022 Lots more people using iPhones (and to a lesser extent Samsung smartphones). What struck me most is that folks you wouldn&apos;t expect to have them \u2013 such as migrant workers in Bangkok, who catch the bus to back up-country on their breaks \u2013 have older devices, like the iPhone 4 or 3GS. All the usual apps, Line, Instagram, Facebook, etc are on-board (from what I&apos;ve seen) thanks to the fact that iOS supports older devices like no other platform. Unlikely that money is being spent, but very likely that users are highly-engaged and active (most have probably spent most of their time online in an Internet cafe). \u2022 Lots of folks with two phones. A feature phone for calling, and an older smartphone for games, apps and other computer-like activities. This is their version of an affordable tablet/computer, I guess, and feeds back to the above. \u2022 A great many smartphone users still evidently on pre-pay deals, as they toggle 3G data settings on/off. Also watched a number of people toggle location on/off, presumably to check-in on Facebook or Foursquare, while taking into account older devices have older batteries which drain quicker. \u2022 Most tablet usage appeared (at least from what I saw) to be among middle-class and upwards.

We are in Rome, and the poem&apos;s speaker is assailed by a kind of vision: a warm sunlit piazza, its busy &quot;fretwork of shadows&quot;, &quot;small navy of carts&quot;, even the marble of the Palazzo Farnese, are dissolved, and in their place he is stood before a hill, &quot;mole-coloured and bare&quot;, looming in a childhood wintertime&apos;s cold and silence &quot;that promised to last forever, like the hill&quot;. Hecht&apos;s hill poem is quite different from Adam Thorpe&apos;s Silbury Hill in prose, not least in the way the latter poet&apos;s imaginative excavations reveal something central and nurturing, wholly at odds with the &quot;plain bitterness&quot; of the former&apos;s. But looming, inscrutability and visionary elements are common to both; and it also calls to\u00a0mind how Thorpe&apos;s astonishing debut novel Ulverton opens by picking out a figure &quot;on the hill at first light&quot;. Perhaps, its speaker wonders, &quot;the warrior buried there had stood up again to haunt us&quot;. Over eight chapters, On Silbury Hill orbits and explores Thorpe&apos;s near-lifelong relationship with a manmade prehistoric mound, a flat-topped pudding dish of grassed-over chalk, whose origins and purpose are essentially mysterious. Fittingly, the book is a gathering, a layering, and Thorpe is at any moment liable to range backwards and forwards across decades and millennia. &quot;The point about Silbury Hill is that she has no point,&quot; he writes, and yet two centuries of curious shaft-sinking and tunnelling had left its structure in such a parlous state by the turn of the millennium, he wonders what any collapse might precipitate psychologically. &quot;This is probably unhealthy. To be so dependent for your sanity on a great prehistoric lump of chalky earth!&quot; Silbury looms alongside the A4, west of Marlborough: probably not the best approach (a walk south along the Ridgeway will afford a more dramatic reveal) but the one most people will be familiar with. The largest manmade hill in Europe, &quot;if the Titanic sailed just behind her in your dreams, you would only see the smoke from the funnels&quot;. The site seems to have been built, in fits and starts, over millions of man hours, about 4,400 years ago, the neolithic giving way to the bronze age, though Thorpe understands how we view everything &quot;from our particular hill in time&quot;: Silbury might be the result of overlap and intermingling, a unique cultural moment, rather than a neat succession. To our enlightened eyes, from John Aubrey&apos;s 1663 sketch to\u00a0a real-time YouTube video where the equinoctial setting sun appears to roll down its slope into the horizon, Silbury has appeared obdurate, blank, unfathomable, open to endless interpretation. While it reaps a record of many attempts to shed light, reading On Silbury Hill is a little like wandering through the Avebury world heritage site and finding interpretation boards juxtaposed with old diaries, field notes and family albums. Thorpe&apos;s father worked for PanAm, and his young son stares out from the edges of early memory, a succession of Rolleiflexed backdrops (Paris, Lebanon, Calcutta, Kathmandu, Bangkok) before the family settled in the Chilterns, at the end of the Metropolitan line, in 1962. Thorpe has an attractive willingness not to suppress or tidy up the knottiness of childhood and its attachments. He discovered the Wiltshire downlands and Silbury towards the end of that decade when he was sent to board at Marlborough College, but not before he\u00a0had grown fond of the clear-floored, cathedral-lit Buckinghamshire beechwood; the new, austere billows and scarps required an adjustment, and biking on to the downs he felt their prehistoric mounds and barrows as &quot;massive and mysterious dreams in the\u00a0middle of a modern wakefulness&quot;. He was desperate for normality \u2013 beechwoods, meadows, suburban gardens \u2013 and these dreams frightened him. His Marlborough sounds like If \u2026 meets Tom Brown&apos;s School Days: lank Lynyrd Skynyrd hair, communal showers and casual sadism. To further complicate matters of belonging, Thorpe&apos;s father was posted to Douala during his second year; the family home was now equatorial West Africa, the school holidays coinciding with its rainy season, where Mount Cameroon rendered the BBC World Service &quot;a murmuring hiss&quot;. In the middle of all this, it is tempting to regard Silbury as forming a still point, an omphalos. &quot;We flicker and zip around here, like a speeded-up film that squashes years into minutes, and she stays quietly the same, giving nothing away.&quot; At the same time, his book and the hill form obvious analogues: a life builds up in layers, and Silbury becomes a kind of book of earth, &quot;a library that could not be physically opened or entered. Or even like a shoebox full of old family snaps.&quot; This, Thorpe suggests, is what the prehistoric mind might have understood: earth, moved and manipulated with antler picks and baskets, is the embodiment of the cyclical movement of time. &quot;There is no such thing as the past. The hill lives and the generations live within it.&quot; Silbury has found itself drawn into wider narratives and myths of origin, of Englishness, perhaps not so much as\u00a0that other strange attractor to the south of Avebury&apos;s sacred precinct, Stonehenge, but nonetheless \u2026 Just before Thorpe made its acquaintance, Silbury felt the white heat of telearchaeology and became a topographical celebrity in the post-Quatermass 1960s. BBC2 did its proto-Time Team thing, the young channel pioneering a live dig\u00a0and bringing science to bear on the implacable chalk, &quot;pocked, prodded, drilled into and &apos;x-rayed&apos; with a seismograph&quot;. Because the findings weren&apos;t visually dramatic \u2013 no sign of local legend King\u00a0Sil mounted in his rumoured gold chamber \u2013 the project was seen as something of a failure, as if decades of\u00a0cutaway Valley of the Kings diagrams and the Sutton Hoo treasure had formed a kind of mass expectation. But there is\u00a0some crackly irony here: the pictures from Silbury would have been broadcast into our living rooms via hilltop transmitters, some of which,\u00a0like Winter Hill serving the north-west of England, were once themselves sites of\u00a0neolithic or bronze\u00a0age activity. Throughout On Silbury Hill, Thorpe is limber enough to explore subtle shades of mood and inwardness, remoteness and intimacy, but also what might be described as the louder anxieties of anyone living across this millennial gap of ours, when the world\u00a0changed from black and white to\u00a0colour and replaced transistor radios with Google glasses, and when the industrial resource-stripping of the planet was no\u00a0longer seen as vaguely heroic but disastrous and unsustainable. The banished gods might only be\u00a0in hiding, and could do worse than Silbury. Despite his vigilance and scepticism \u2013 even towards his own &quot;tofu-knitting, yoghurt-weaving&quot; susceptibilities \u2013 Thorpe arrives at something like his own theory of the hill. You should burrow in and discover this for yourself, but what makes On Silbury Hill such a rich and evocative book of place are the myriad two-way hauntings he proposes between people and landscapes over time. And when our world has gone for scrap, the A4 lies\u00a0like a shadow in the topsoil, and the very words in On Silbury Hill form mysterious squiggles &quot;like the mark of\u00a0disease on a leaf&quot;, Silbury will most likely still be stood there, broadcasting on its own chalky frequencies. \u2022 To order On Silbury Hill for \u00a312 with free UK p&amp;p call Guardian book service on 0330 333 6846 or go to guardianbookshop.co.uk.", "publicationDate": "2014-07-17T11:00:01Z", "tags": ["Science and nature", "Books", "Culture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/17/on-silbury-hill-adam-thorpe-review", "title": "On Silbury Hill review \u2013 a rich and evocative book of place", "sentences": ["Thorpe&apos;s father worked for PanAm, and his young son stares out from the edges of early memory, a succession of Rolleiflexed backdrops (Paris, Lebanon, Calcutta, Kathmandu, Bangkok) before the family settled in the Chilterns, at the end of the Metropolitan line, in 1962."]}, {"article": "Among more than 100 scientists and campaigners flying to the international Aids conference in Melbourne on board flight MH17 was a former leader in the field, Joep Lange from the Netherlands, who was travelling with his partner, Jacqueline van Tongeren. Lange was president of the International Aids Society, which runs the meeting, from 2002 to 2004, spanning the two-year interval between the Barcelona and Bangkok conferences, where drug treatment for all those with HIV around the world were top of the agenda. The Aids pandemic threw scientists such as Lange into the political maelstrom and many of them took on campaigning and political roles alongside their research. Lange, 60, was professor of medicine at the academic medical centre of the University of Amsterdam and specialised in drugs to treat HIV infection and prevent people developing Aids. He was senior scientific adviser to the International Antiviral Therapy Evaluation Centre in Amsterdam. Having helped to develop drugs for HIV, he was in the forefront of efforts by the scientific community to make them widely available to a population in the developing world who could not possibly pay the very high prices drug companies asked. Around the time of the 2000 Durban Aids conference, when the controversy around access was at its height, a three-drug combination cost $10,000 per patient per year. In 2001, Lange founded the PharmAccess Foundation, which worked to get access to the drugs for those in poor countries and he continued as its chair until his death. He was also co-director of an HIV research collaboration based in Thailand. The director of the Wellcome Trust, Dr Jeremy Farrar, paid tribute to him and others in the HIV community who died on the plane. He said: &quot;I am deeply saddened that Joep Lange, his partner Jacqueline van Tongeren, and other colleagues from the World Health Organisation and the HIV research community are reported to be among those killed in the MH17 disaster. &quot;Joep was a great clinical scientist, and a great friend of the Wellcome Trust who has long been a valued adviser. He was also a personal friend. He is a great loss to global health research. The thoughts and sympathies of all of us at the Trust are with his family and other families who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.&quot; Emeritus professor of viral oncology at UCL, Prof Robin Weiss, said: &quot;Not since the loss of Jonathan Mann and his wife on the sabotaged Swiss Air flight to Geneva 17 years ago has the HIV/Aids research community suffered such a great loss.&quot; Shaun Mellors, the associate director for Africa at the UK-based International HIV/Aids Alliance, talked of the shock and sadness of everybody in the HIV community. &quot;This is a profound collective loss to science, to research, to medicine and to public health and our deepest condolences are with their loved ones,&quot; he said. &quot;They spent their lives fighting for the lives of others and we pledge to continue their important work. &quot;I first met Joep in 1995 when I was working for the Global Network of People Living with HIV (GNP+). I was young and an inexperienced activist who had moved from South Africa to take on this challenging new role as the executive director and in Joep I found a mentor and ally. He was a powerful advocate for treatment access, fought hard to ensure that people living with HIV were involved and included, was not afraid to share his views even if they were against the establishment, and he had a wicked and enjoyable sense of humour. &quot;He taught me a lot about equity and politics, and also about being a humble and effective individual. He introduced me to the world of clinical science, where I did not have to be afraid of it, but rather question and engage with it. His commitment to the work that he was doing is something that we all need to continue \u2013 because he would expect it of us, nothing less.&quot; There was shock, outrage and distress at the Melbourne conference, which officially opens on Sunday but is already running sessions. &quot;There&apos;s a huge feeling of sadness here, people are in floods of tears in the corridors,&quot; Clive Aspin, a HIV researcher who attended the pre-conference plenary session in Sydney, told Guardian Australia. &quot;These people were the best and the brightest, the ones who had dedicated their whole careers to fighting this terrible virus. It&apos;s devastating.&quot; The director of the Monash Immunology and Stem Cell Laboratories, Prof Richard Boyd, said he was &quot;gutted&quot; by the losses. &quot;There were some serious HIV leaders on that plane,&quot; he said. &quot;This will have ramifications globally because whenever you lose a leader in any field, it has an impact. That knowledge is irreplaceable.&quot; &quot;Truly beautiful, inspiring, committed, smart and compassionate people have been brutally taken away from us,&quot; said Murdo Bijl, a Dutch Aids advocate who knew many of those on board MH17. &quot;The world and the Aids field will miss these brilliant doctors, advocates, researchers and friends.&quot; Glenn Thomas, a senior communications officer at the World Health Organisation, based in Geneva, who had specialised in the big infectious diseases \u2013 Aids, TB and malaria \u2013 was one of an estimated 108 people headed for the conference on the plane. Thomas, 46, was British and had worked for the BBC before moving to Switzerland. Other names mentioned include Martine de Schutter, executive coordinator of the campaigning group Aids Action Europe and Pim de Kuijer, a Dutch Aids activist and parliamentary lobbyist, who spent time as an intern with the MEP Lousewies van der Laan. In a statement, Van der Laan said: &quot;Pim believed in understanding between countries, the rule of law and equality for all and fought for his values through his work and his political activities. Let&apos;s try to live up to his legacy and work even harder towards a peaceful world.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-07-18T11:53:45Z", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "Aids and HIV", "Plane crashes", "Ukraine", "Russia", "Melbourne", "Australia news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/18/mh17-victims-president-international-aids-joep-lange-melbourne-conference", "title": "MH17 victims include former president of International Aids Society", "sentences": ["Lange was president of the International Aids Society, which runs the meeting, from 2002 to 2004, spanning the two-year interval between the Barcelona and Bangkok conferences, where drug treatment for all those with HIV around the world were top of the agenda."]}, {"article": "At different points this weekend, the bleary-eyed footballers of Newcastle United and West Ham United will step wearily into the southern hemisphere winter. While other clubs fly to North America or Thailand, these two sets of modern-day missionaries are undertaking 24,000-mile return journeys to New Zealand to spread the Premier League gospel while playing friendlies against Wellington Phoenix and Sydney FC in Dunedin, Auckland and Wellington. When it comes to summer tours, Premier League clubs\u2019 marketing departments like nothing better than tackling new frontiers. Merchandising managers dream of parking their commercial tanks on foreign front lawns \u2013 or at least planting a flag, in club colours, on hitherto alien soil. If, privately at least, Alan Pardew\u2019s players may be less than enthused about going so far for a short stay \u2013 Newcastle will spend only six days in the South Pacific region after arriving on Sunday \u2013 rights to televise their friendlies have been snapped up by 20 countries stretching from Australia to America and Israel to Indonesia. It is the first time in 29 years that leading English teams are visiting New Zealand and Felicity Croft, West Ham\u2019s commercial director, could not be more delighted that her club have set themselves apart from the nine Premier League rivals who opted to head for the ultra-fashionable United States this summer. \u201cIt\u2019s a long way to go but definitely worth it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ll use the tour to develop our fan base and commercial opportunities around the world.\u201d During a 12-day stay, Sam Allardyce\u2019s side, who arrive on Saturday, will stage open training sessions, with their defender Winston Reid, New Zealand\u2019s captain, pictured, a star attraction. \u201cWe\u2019re giving fans the chance to really touch and feel a Premier League club,\u201d Croft says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a large programme of exciting community events and we\u2019re going to be talking to fans about what they want from us. Football\u2019s landscape is changing and we want to ensure we\u2019re at the forefront of commercial deals so we can compete in the Premier League.\u201d With \u201csoccer\u201d finally capturing North American hearts and minds \u2013 and the United States providing none of the counterfeit problems confronting official merchandisers in east Asia \u2013 it is no surprise that Arsenal, Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Swansea City, Tottenham Hotspur and West Bromwich Albion will have crossed the Atlantic by the end of the month. Perhaps surprisingly, Swansea City, currently in Chicago, commanded the highest television audience for a Premier League match in the US last season. On NBC \u2013 where Robbie Mustoe, the former Middlesbrough midfielder, is a key analyst \u2013 more than 1.2m viewers watched Garry Monk\u2019s side beat Cardiff 3-0 in February. Steve Parish, Crystal Palace\u2019s chairman, seems anxious to jump on the bandwagon. \u201cAmerica\u2019s a big market so we\u2019ll be PR-ing the hell out of it and make it aware of Crystal Palace,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll try to ease the burden on Tony Pulis as he\u2019s got to get the team ready over there but he\u2019ll still do as much as he can to promote the club. Tony\u2019s compiled a great list of things we can give away that the fans out there will like.\u201d Only a few years ago Palace might have been joining those Premier League peers flocking to the Orient but only Everton and Leicester City \u2013 who have Thai sponsors and owners respectively \u2013 are heading to east Asia, where they will play each other in Bangkok. With South Africa similarly slipping out of summer touring fashion, it will be interesting to see where is in vogue come the new year, when clubs begin organising their 2015 tours. Last winter Pardew \u2013 who urgently needs a good start to the season and, significantly, has left Hatem Ben Arfa behind \u2013 could easily have identified several attractive pre-season programmes without involving 30 hour each way journeys down under. Unfortunately such plans would not have dovetailed quite so neatly with Mike Ashley\u2019s global expansion blueprint for Sports Direct. The Newcastle owner\u2019s principal business has recently announced plans to launch in Australia and New Zealand, opening three large stores while also forming a partnership with a leading internet retailer. If, to differing degrees, branding plays a big part in every club\u2019s overseas expeditions, the human factor looms large too. After all, summer is a time for not merely laying solid fitness foundations but bonding \u2013 on and off the pitch. There is the \u201cwhat happens on tour stays on tour\u201d aspect of things. \u201cWives and girlfriends hate pre-season trips abroad,\u201d acknowledges one former Premier League press officer. \u201cThey know the boys will be given the odd night off when they head to bars and nightclubs and there\u2019ll be plenty of pulling \u2013 or \u2018birding\u2019 \u2013 opportunities.\u201d In rather different contexts, Brendan Rodgers, Mauricio Pochettino and Louis van Gaal must \u201cseize the moment\u201d during their American forays. As Rodgers\u2019 Liverpool settle into headquarters at Harvard University and begin adjusting to life after Luis Su\u00e1rez, Pochettino aims to imbue Tottenham\u2019s squad with his hard-pressing philosophy and Van Gaal wants to make an immediate\u00a0impact. Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s new rival frequently gives the impression he is more than a mere mortal. Yet even the indefatigable 62-year-old Dutchman surely faces the real risk of burnout after swapping his orange tie for a red one and switching seamlessly from choreographing Holland\u2019s World Cup campaign to flying Stateside as United\u2019s public face. These exercises frequently provoke conflicts of interest between clubs\u2019 business and football departments; managers resent being asked to press the flesh at corporate functions when they could be more usefully employed talking tactics on practice pitches. Already Van Gaal has hinted at such creative tensions by making pointed remarks about the extent of the marketing commitments demanded by directors who simultaneously expect him to dethrone Pellegrini\u2019s City. \u201cIt\u2019s not always easy to fulfil commercial and football expectations,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s my big\u00a0challenge.\u201d Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is sufficiently concerned about post-World Cup fatigue to have persuaded Roman Abramovich that, for once, Chelsea could do without a lucrative summer tour. Mourinho\u2019s players featured for more minutes and covered greater distances than those from any Premier League rival during Brazil 2014. Small wonder he believes an Austrian training camp will prove the most restorative springboard for a title challenge. Another big fan of Austria, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, has long frowned on trans-continental summer tours but even Arsenal are facing Thierry Henry\u2019s Red Bulls in New York as the Gunners make their first US visit since 1989. With Sunderland striving to gain a commercial foothold in southern and west Africa \u2013 Nigeria is a particular target \u2013 Lagos probably loomed large in Gus Poyet\u2019s nightmares. Instead he has persuaded his board that squad fitness matters more than exploiting merchandising leads. \u201cPeople need to realise pre-season is hard and players need to suffer a little bit, mentally as well as physically,\u201d says Poyet whose squad are bound for a Portuguese training camp. \u201cThe more you suffer now, the less you\u2019ll suffer later. If you get pre-season right you\u2019ll be ready.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2014-07-18T14:53:28Z", "tags": ["Premier League", "Newcastle United", "West Ham United", "Football", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/18/premier-league-pre-season-tours-spread-gospel", "title": "Premier League pre-season tours spread the gospel far and wide", "sentences": ["Tony\u2019s compiled a great list of things we can give away that the fans out there will like.\u201d Only a few years ago Palace might have been joining those Premier League peers flocking to the Orient but only Everton and Leicester City \u2013 who have Thai sponsors and owners respectively \u2013 are heading to east Asia, where they will play each other in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "It looks virtually identical to a conventional online page of the Guardian \u2013 the same layout, typography, links to other sections, and comments below the line. The story, with Money reporter Miles Brignall&apos;s byline, gives a glowing account of a company called Business Grants &amp; Loans. But the page is entirely fake, hosted on a copycat website and apparently designed by fraudsters to give the impression that the company has won independent endorsement from the Guardian \u2013 and to lure victims into handing over hundreds of pounds each. Until now, fake websites have tended to be clones of bank websites or institutions such as HM Revenue &amp; Customs. Conmen send out &quot;phishing&quot; emails which convince people to click through to the bank, but, in reality, they are taken through to the copycat website designed to illegally capture log-ins and password details. But the fake Guardian pages are, thankfully, a rare example of an attempt to give the impression that a trusted news organisation has endorsed a company. The fake website page uses the address &quot;theguardian.com.uk&quot; \u2013 rather than our real web address, which is theguardian.com. The Guardian immediately asked the internet service provider that hosts the page to take it down. We were alerted to the scam by a victim who paid \u00a3175 to Business Grants &amp; Loans by bank transfer, but then failed to receive the loan of \u00a315,000 that she had been promised. She had been sent an email from the company (see composite above) which read: &quot;To back things up, in 2013 we were mentioned in the Guardian. &quot;We would strongly suggest you read the article below, this should give you the confidence you need in our company \u2026&quot; In the fake article, readers are told that Business Grants &amp; Loans is an &quot;expanding company&quot; which is &quot;helping 76% of applicants achieve the funding they desire&quot;. It tells readers to head to the company&apos;s website, and goes to extraordinary lengths to make the article appear genuine \u2013 even creating fake below-the-line comments from regular readers of Guardian Money, such as &quot;Halo572&quot; and &quot;oommph&quot;.     commenters    One fake entry reads: &quot;I myself have dealt with them and they found me a loan option that was very suitable within just a few days.&quot; To add greater authenticity, it includes our reporter&apos;s email address \u2013 with a small change, so anyone trying to email him is directed away from his regular address. At this stage we should make clear to readers that the Guardian&apos;s website has not, in any way, been hacked or hijacked, with genuine pages replaced with fake ones. The idea is that pages are created that appear to be from the Guardian, then are put up on a URL (uniform resource locator) that is similar to the Guardian (ie, &quot;.com.uk&quot; rather than just &quot;.com&quot;). They are then embedded in web links that are sent via emails to the company&apos;s clients. We are keen to hear from anybody else who has been duped. Another example we found of fraudsters imitating a trusted news organisation was last June, when a faked BBC website news page appeared to be endorsing some dodgy diet pills. Entitled &quot;Special Report: We expose how to lose 23lbs of Belly Fat&quot;, and posted on fake BBC Health pages, it was a crude reconstruction of a BBC web story, but it may have been enough to give it credence in some readers&apos; minds \u2013 which was the obvious intention. The URL was &quot;World-BBC.co.uk&quot; rather than the conventional &quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;. We asked the Guardian&apos;s IT department to find out as much as possible about the fake web page. Very quickly, we learned that it appeared to have been produced, relatively recently, by a &quot;Kieren Daniel Farrer-Thornton&quot;. After an extensive investigation, we were able to trace Thornton to Thailand. He had previously run a web design business, called KK Web Design, which promised to &quot;offer a very unique concept to web design&quot; but which has been inactive in recent years. In January 2012 he began a Facebook page from Thailand, claiming to be in Bangkok. By November 2012 he is boasting that he is &quot;a money-making machine&quot; and a few days later posts &quot;guna have a fukin expensive weekend after our best week at work yet \u2026 just over \u00a313k hitting the bank, were guna be rich fukers after xmas&quot; \u2013 which links to an Ashton Saunders. He also boasts of &quot;rooftop parties, champagne and enough hot girls that ill need to rent the whole hotel&quot;.     samui    He even shares a link to a BBC story about two men fined \u00a3440,000 for sending millions of spam text messages, and writes next to it: &quot;AND WE THOUGHT WE WERE BAD.... GARY U NAUGHTY BOY!!!!&quot; The Facebook postings stop at the beginning of 2013, just after Thornton says he has had a meeting with a software company. But what about the company itself, Business Grants &amp; Loans? In the UK, calls are met with an automated message which says it is so busy handling &quot;thousands of applications&quot; that correspondence must be done entirely via email, although all our emails went unanswered. Its website is ukgrants.org.uk, and claims to be based in Amersham, Bucks. At Companies House, Business Grants &amp; Loans is a trading name of Business Grant Finder Ltd, whose company director is listed as 27-year-old Ashton Saunders \u2013 who also pops up regularly on Kieren Thornton&apos;s Facebook postings. We located Saunders in Pattaya, Thailand \u2013 where he claimed to have no knowledge of the fake Guardian pages. He said he had sold the company a year ago to his cousin \u2013 who he named as Kieren Thornton. At Companies House there is no indication that the Business Grant Finder Ltd has been sold or dissolved. We asked Saunders about fraud. Did he have any knowledge of fees taken when there was no chance of the person obtaining a loan? He said that, when he ran the company, it was a legitimate business that took fees but did arrange loans. Just before Money went to press, the plot thickened. In a statement attributed to Kieren Thornton, but sent by Saunders, Thornton confirmed he had bought the company \u2013 but claimed he was the victim of a scam. He said that eight months ago he was contacted by a customer, who provided a link to an article about his company. &quot;I just saved the link but also got my web designer to store it for myself on a hosting account that I owned, in case it disappeared from your site. &quot;Clearly, for some reason, they have made this, and now I understand it is a false document. I do not understand the intentions behind this customer and the reasons they would do this. &quot;However, this has now been removed as you have gladly brought it to my attention.&quot; Thornton was also quoted as saying the company &quot;unfortunately has been slandered online as being a scam&quot;. He added: &quot;I have always cooperated with any customer who has complained \u2026 I will not be charging any customers a fee until I, myself, source grants that are available for our clients.&quot; Meanwhile, the person who alerted us to the fake page says: &quot;You don&apos;t take out a loan if you don&apos;t need the money. We had a call from someone and it all sounded very convincing \u2013 helped by the Guardian article, or so we thought. &quot;We paid the admin fee by transfer, but now, every time we call, we are told the offices are closed for training purposes. We have been scammed, and it doesn&apos;t feel very nice.&quot; The money was paid into a NatWest account. She has since taken up the matter with her bank, and has been told investigations are ongoing. Meanwhile, the Guardian has passed details of its investigation to Action Fraud, the fraud and internet crime reporting centre run by the City of London Police. Spot the clues It is not always easy to spot a copycat website, but here are some clues that all is not as it seems, writes Hilary Osborne. Search for the real thing Put the name of the website you think you have been looking at into a search engine and see what comes up. In many cases the genuine article will appear at or near the top. Do not assume that is the case unless it&apos;s a site you know well \u2013 and certainly be careful if appears at the top and is marked up as an advert (look out for &quot;Ad&quot; next to it) - but if something does appear that looks different to the site you were looking at, that should ring alarm bells. Look at the URL Really closely. Now look again. The copycat site will probably have a URL that looks very similar to the real thing, but there will be subtle differences. In the case of the fake Guardian page, the URL is theguardian.com.uk \u2013 visit the Guardian site from the UK and the real address is theguardian.com/uk. That dot gives the game away. For government sites it&apos;s worth remembering that. Chop the URL down If you find yourself on what looks to be a sub-page of a website cut back the URL to see if the homepage actually exists. The fake Guardian page has an address starting &quot;http://theguardian.com.uk-news-article-database-business-grants-loans-review-listed ...&quot; \u2013 cut it back to end after &quot;.uk&quot; and you end up on a page telling you the server has not been found. Click on links Explore the page thoroughly as there is likely to be something somewhere that gives it away. Perhaps a link won&apos;t work, or will go to something unexpected \u2013 on the fake page we feature, clicking on the &quot;article history&quot; link showed the title of a different story, while the stories at the top of the &quot;most read box&quot; were all from May.", "publicationDate": "2014-07-19T06:00:39Z", "tags": ["Internet safety", "Consumer affairs", "Money", "Technology", "Internet, phones & broadband", "UK news", "Internet"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jul/19/fake-guardian-webpages-boost-credibility", "title": "Reader scammed by fake Guardian webpage", "sentences": ["In January 2012 he began a Facebook page from Thailand, claiming to be in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Teaching abroad is a popular job choice for students leaving university, thanks to the almost guaranteed prospect of employment and the opportunities for adventure it offers. It can be a great way to see the world without it costing you anything. Depending on where you teach, you might even be able to save some cash. But teaching overseas can be a daunting prospect and raises all kinds of important questions from, &quot;What experience do I need?&quot; to, &quot;Will I be able to buy my favourite cheese in Outer Mongolia?&quot;. Here&apos;s what you need to know before you book your flight. What qualifications do I need? The basic qualificationBy far the most common route into teaching abroad is to teach English as a foreign language (EFL). It might seem like a bit of a stretch from that degree in physics, but if your native tongue is English then you&apos;re already most of the way there. Contrary to popular belief, you don&apos;t need to speak a foreign language to teach abroad and a background in education or professional teaching experience is not required for most jobs. Although it&apos;s possible to find jobs teaching EFL without any experience or qualifications, the majority of language schools require a university degree \u2013 in any subject \u2013 and a Tefl (teaching English as a foreign language) certificate. Tefl certification can be found cheaply online, but many recommend investing in a 120-hour Tefl course such as the Celta (Certificate in teaching English to speakers of other languages) qualification, which is offered by more than 300 centres around the world. Piers Lloyd, who is currently teaching at a private English school in Burma, says: &quot;It&apos;s easy to find cheap Tefl courses \u2013 before I got my Celta I completed a weekend-long crash course in EFL teaching,&quot; says Lloyd. &quot;But the Celta course prepared me better, as I had to teach assessed lessons.&quot; The professional qualificationTeaching abroad is also a popular choice for qualified teachers with a PGCE (postgraduate certificate in education). Raj Ladva completed a PGCE in early years education at the University of the West of England (UWE) before moving to Bangkok, Thailand, where he teaches at a top international school. Ladva recommends getting some teaching experience at home before looking for work overseas. &quot;I taught for two years in the UK after completing my PGCE. The best international schools, and the ones with the best expatriate packages, prefer candidates to have at least two years of teaching experience after they qualify,&quot; he says. He sees many advantages to teaching abroad over the UK. &quot;I received an increased salary, housing allowance, bonuses, flights home and of course the full school holidays,&quot; he says. Teachers with a Bachelor of Education or PGCE aren&apos;t limited to teaching English. Rachel Eastwell completed a PGCE in the UK before moving abroad to teach in Bogota, Colombia. &quot;I work in the pre-school section of a large, private bilingual school which follows the International Baccalaureate curriculum,&quot; she says. &quot;Although almost all of my students are Colombian, the language of instruction is English so I also teach subjects like maths and science.&quot; How much can I earn? Teaching abroad is one of the most cost-effective ways to live and travel overseas for an extended period. Even as a first-time English teacher, you can expect to earn enough to pay your rent and live comfortably. Some of the best deals can be found in Asia, where teachers can earn enough to save a proportion of their salary each month. &quot;Teachers can easily leave South Korea with \u00a35,000-6,000 in savings, depending on how they live throughout the year,&quot; says Carrie Kellenberger, owner of international recruitment agency Reach to Teach. She also recommends China for graduates looking to save money during their first year abroad. &quot;Schools in China typically offer flights and accommodation, among other perks,&quot; she says. For even better salaries, consider countries in the Middle East, such as the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. However, be aware that some of these positions require professional teaching experience or an advanced degree in education. What can I expect?  The only way to know what to expect when you move halfway around the world is to make sure you&apos;ve done your research, according to Eugene Quah, chief executive officer of Edulink Australia, a private English language school based in Burma. &quot;We have had teachers who were unhappy because they came to Burma thinking it would be a tropical paradise where people all live in bamboo huts. They end up leaving because their expectations are unrealistic,&quot; says Quah. &quot;Ask the school to put you in touch with a current teacher so you can find out what it&apos;s like to work there. If someone asks for a job at our school, and they don&apos;t ask questions, I get nervous about employing them,&quot; he says.     Yangon, Burma. People in Burma don't all live in bamboo huts. Do your research to know what to expect from a city. Photograph: Alamy    Although it can be a life-changing experience, living overseas can also be challenging. Anna Felgenhauer, who has been teaching in South Korea for over four years, admits there are some down sides to living abroad. &quot;Of course missing friends and family and dealing with homesickness can be hard, and I also miss things like good cheese! Getting used to the culture in a different county can be difficult,&quot; she says. The work can be tough too. Lloyd says that a heavy class load, difficult students and a demanding boss were some of the issues with his job teaching in Thailand. &quot;I was teaching 18 different classes every week, all with between 30 and 40 students. A lot of my time was spent dealing with difficult students, which wasn&apos;t very rewarding. I got no support, which was difficult as a first-time teacher. You have to have a strong character,&quot; he says. However, most agree that teaching abroad is a rewarding opportunity to see the world, experience other cultures, and learn about yourself. &quot;Think about the stories you will have to tell,&quot; Ladva says. &quot;Whether you&apos;re in it for the money, the opportunities for travel or just for the pure fun of living somewhere you have only seen on a map, teaching abroad is nothing short of an adventure.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-07-23T13:17:00Z", "tags": ["Tefl", "Teaching", "Education", "Advice for students", "Students"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jul/23/teaching-abroad-how-what-expect", "title": "Teaching abroad after uni: a guide for grads", "sentences": ["Raj Ladva completed a PGCE in early years education at the University of the West of England (UWE) before moving to Bangkok, Thailand, where he teaches at a top international school."]}, {"article": "It&apos;s tempting to assume that Boris Johnson&apos;s plan for a floating village to be constructed on the waters of east London&apos;s Royal Victoria Dock will, you know, sink without trace. Veteran Boris-watchers will recall great excitement about a &quot;living bridge&quot; being built across the Thames. Nothing has been heard of it since. The site for the floating village would be right alongside the little used Emirates Airline cable car, another mayoral wizard wheeze. This might be taken as a bad sign.  The village will be small, covering just 15 acres. But there are grounds for believing in it. There are also reasons for wishing it well. The plans, which won a competition held under the auspices of the Mayor&apos;s London Development Panel, have been drawn up by a consortium of mainstream developer Carillion, housing association Genesis and sustainable regeneration specialists Igloo.  The latter has made a pleasing mark on London with its Bermondsey Square project. Its chief executive Chris Brown writes a mighty good blog. Brown agrees with Newham mayor Sir Robin Wales, who will determine the project&apos;s future, that the village mustn&apos;t be a &quot;yuppie ghetto&quot;. He confirms that he envisages some of its 50 homes being affordable.  &quot;I don&apos;t want to sound over the top,&quot; Brown says, &quot;but for some people this style of living really is a dream. We don&apos;t want it to be exclusively for the well-off.&quot; Meanwhile, the Green Party at City Hall is keen on the &quot;custom building&quot; involved, meaning that residents are involved in designing their own homes. This fits with Green ideals about housing innovation and communities taking the lead in developments. Johnson sees the village as part of his quest to turn the Royal Docks into London&apos;s next business district. George Osborne has designated them an enterprise zone, meaning tax breaks and looser planning regulations for investors. Last year, it was announced that a Chinese company would create \u00a31bn &quot;business port&quot; in the Royal Albert Dock and in February it opened an office there. As well as homes, Johnson anticipates &quot;a unique mixed-use development&quot; complete with restaurants, cafes and even a lido, making the floating village a visitor attraction.  There are other floating settlements around the world: a seniors village in Sausalito; markets in Bangkok; Ijburg&apos;s island city.

Talking last month on his late-night HBO show Last Week Tonight, Oliver ridiculed Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha&apos;s &quot;dystopian nightmare&quot; of a government, called Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn a &quot;buffoon&quot; and an &quot;idiot&quot;, and ridiculed a clip of a contentious home video of the prince and his semi-naked wife at a poolside birthday party for their pet poodle Foo Foo. &quot;You&apos;re telling me they&apos;re not supposed to make fun of that?&quot; Oliver asks incredulously \u2013 referring to strict pro-monarchy laws prohibiting anyone from poking fun at the monarchy. &quot;That&apos;s entrapment!&quot; Under Thailand&apos;s strict lese-majeste laws, anyone who insults, defames or threatens the royal family can be imprisoned for up to 15 years \u2013 a law Oliver calls &quot;stupid&quot; and the countries who wield such laws stupid as well. The Cambridge-educated polemicist then goes on to pick apart Prayuth&apos;s recent happiness campaigns across the capital, Bangkok, where locals and foreigners alike have been offered free meals and haircuts, music concerts put on by Thai soldiers and flanked by PVC-clad dancers, and the chance to both pet a pony and take a selfie next to a trussed-up soldier as an attempt to &quot;bring back happiness to the people&quot; after a decade of political in-fighting. &quot;If they think people are that easy to manipulate, they are right,&quot; Oliver jokes to much audience laughter. &quot;Look, I can&apos;t vote or express dissent, but look at [the pony]! He&apos;s so soft.&quot; The comments have not gone down well in Thailand, where the ruling National Council for Peace and Order has restricted media freedoms; detained activists, politicians and academics; temporarily suspended social media; and blocked tens of thousands of websites deemed &quot;harmful&quot; to national security. According to a confidential document reportedly obtained by Vice magazine, the Thai government now also considers Oliver one of a number of international threats currently &quot;undermining the royal institution&quot;.

A former president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, he became known for a polite form of modernism that proved attractive to establishment clients, with its references to historical forms, often characterised by strong symmetry and the sort of spatial arrangements found in classical buildings. He brought an uncompromising approach, with a fierce insistence on quality \u2013 which was to prove too much for the BBC. The \u00a3800m redevelopment of Broadcasting House, designed by MacCormac and completed in 2012, ended in an acrimonious row that marked a dispiriting note towards the end of his career. After battles over his plans for the newsroom, and 300 changes to his design, MacCormac complained of &quot;insufferable contempt&quot; and a &quot;dumbing down&quot; of his scheme, warning it would become &quot;no better than a speculative office building&quot;. He was sacked in 2005, five years into the project, in what the BBC described as an &quot;exceptionally painful&quot; break-up. It was a process of drastic cost-cutting and subservience to the contractor that MacCormac had not had to face until then. Throughout the 1980s and 90s, he developed a sophisticated and courteous architectural language that proved attractive to well-endowed Oxbridge colleges. He built several refined, carefully detailed schemes for St John&apos;s, Oxford, and his alma mater, Trinity, Cambridge, as well as the ellipse-shaped Ruskin Library for Lancaster University and faculty buildings in Warwick. He also created one of the Jubilee line&apos;s most memorable stations in Southwark in 1999, welcoming commuters with the sweeping arc of a bright blue atrium, topped with a flying saucer lantern, in a nod to Charles Holden&apos;s earlier station designs. Other notable projects include the British Embassy in Bangkok (2008) and the Wellcome Wing at the Science Museum in London (2000). Born in Marylebone, cental London, MacCormac came from a medical family with roots in Northern Ireland. Interested in boats since he built model ships as a small boy, spent his national service in the Royal Navy (1957-59) and retained a love for sailing, owning a 1908 oyster-fishing smack that he sailed in the Thames Estuary. From Westminster school he went to Trinity, where he gained a double-first and would later teach (1969\u201375 and 1979-81), before proceeding to the Bartlett School of Architecture at University College London, exposing him to two very different environments. As he wrote in an essay in Arena magazine in 1967, on his and fellow students&apos; experience coming from Cambridge to the Bartlett: &quot;Our aesthetic preoccupations soon convicted us of &apos;formalism&apos;, but our relative success in solving organisational problems prompted us to consider whether the architects&apos; traditional concern with pattern, order and simplicity was not effective in solving physical as well as aesthetic problems.&quot; It was a desire for humane &quot;elegant solutions&quot; that he would go on to pursue, against the mechanistic, &quot;cold-blooded&quot; alternative of the Bartlett. MacCormac began his career at the modernist practice of Powell and Moya in 1963, before joining Lyons Israel and Ellis in 1965, from where he moved in 1967 to the London borough of Merton to work on social housing projects. He left to set up the practice MacCormac Jamieson Prichard in 1972, with Peter Jamieson and David Prichard, and soon won an open competition for a university building in Bristol, which would define the direction of the following decades.     MacCormac designed the atrium at Southwark underground station on the Jubilee line in south London. Photograph: Peter Durant/arcblue    The stepped brick Sainsbury student accommodation building for Worcester College, Oxford (1982), was followed by the Bowra Building, Wadham College (1993), and the Garden Quadrangle at St John&apos;s College (1994). Then came the Ruskin Library at Lancaster University (1996) and the accommodation blocks of Burrell&apos;s Field for Trinity College, Cambridge (also 1996) \u2013 which he always considered his finest work. All are characterised by an unfolding sequence of vistas and carefully framed routes, the forms modelled with a clear sense of hierarchy and proportion, if sometimes feeling a little mannered. They owe much to the work of Frank Lloyd Wright as well as the Arts and Crafts movement, the incorporation of artwork in his buildings being a recurring theme. Knighted in 2001, MacCormac stood out at a time when many of his contemporaries were pursuing hi-tech and postmodernist routes. In 2008 his firm became MJP Architects. In a review of its book Building Ideas (2010), the architectural historian Alan Powers wrote: &quot;MacCormac&apos;s career is almost a parable for the whole drift of architecture since 1970 \u2026 [along with Ted Cullinan and others, he] weathered the storms of the 1960s and 70s and helped to re-establish trust in architects and their intentions.&quot; MacCormac met his partner of 30 years, the author Jocasta Innes, when she moved in next door to his home and office in Spitalfields, east London. &quot;One of my assistants \u2026 came back one day and said he&apos;d seen this extraordinary woman up a ladder \u2013 next to our office \u2013 in a cat-suit with a blowtorch, ordering men around,&quot; MacCormac recalled. &quot;I was attracted to her immediately.&quot; Together, they restored and revived the pair of Regency houses, complete with a secret passage running between them. &quot;The two Spitalfields houses, and our lives, were bound together,&quot; wrote MacCormac, in a book on the houses published last month: &quot;They have many characteristics in common \u2013 illusion, allusion, surprise, humour and, of course, colour.&quot; Jeremy Estop, the managing director of MJP, described MacCormac as being &quot;able to &apos;speak&apos; through design, but also with a rare gift with words, allowing him to lucidly articulate architectural ideas and philosophy. [He] wore his intellect lightly, constantly perspicacious, but always ready with an anecdote or joke. He was eager to exchange ideas with everyone regardless of age or experience.&quot; Ultimately MacCormac lost his voice to illness. He is survived by a son, Will, from his marriage to Susan Landen in 1964, which ended in separation in 1983; another son, Luke, predeceased him. \u2022 Richard Cornelius MacCormac, architect, born 3 September 1938; died 26 July 2014", "publicationDate": "2014-07-29T17:56:39Z", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art and design", "BBC", "Media", "London Underground", "London", "Rail transport", "University of Cambridge", "University of Oxford", "Lancaster University", "UCL (University College London)", "UK news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jul/29/richard-maccormac", "title": "Sir Richard MacCormac obituary", "sentences": ["Other notable projects include the British Embassy in Bangkok (2008) and the Wellcome Wing at the Science Museum in London (2000)."]}, {"article": "UK and US supermarket groups are meeting in Thailand this week to create a taskforce to tackle trafficking and forced labour in the shrimp feed industry.

Morrisons, Tesco and Costco US, which buy farmed shrimp from CP Foods, are among the retailers expected to attend the talks with Thai government representatives. Several international catering and food-service firms including Sodexo, Brakes as well as campaigners from Oxfam and the Environmental Justice Foundation will be among the attendees.

The aim of the meeting is to agree on the terms of an industry action group, which will work with CP Foods to establish a global benchmark in sustainable shrimp-feed production. It will also help the Thai government create a strategy to halt human trafficking and forced labour in the seafood supply chain.

Is your favourite show not included? Let us know about it in the comment thread below. La Divina Commedia, 2002 Performed by award-winning Russian physical theatre company Derevo.  I was at the fringe performing with my school, only 17, when we went to see this Russian total theatre troupe. As a rather sheltered chap from rural Lincolnshire, I had never seen anything like it. Utterly blew apart my idea of what theatre could be. I remember shaking as we walked out of the venue (the circus big top, I think).

Doctor Brown Because, 2010  Performed by visual comedy absurdist Doctor Brown.   This was the first Doctor Brown show I saw at the fringe. Maybe his first there. We sat in an audience of at most six or seven people and got pelted with olives and branflakes in the first 30 minutes without him uttering a word. We were transfixed and terrified and distinctly isolated in the gloomy cave. In the second half of the show a friend was coaxed on stage and \u201coiled up\u201d. Afterwards we sat in bemused, exhilarated shock! I went back 3 times with various friends that year just to see their reaction \u2026 with never more than a handful in the crowd. We all felt we had uncovered something special.

Her distress is evident as she relives the experience.\u201d Eight Songs for a Mad King, 1973 This is a monodrama by Peter Maxwell Davies, based on words by King George III. In this case, it was performed by Davies himself and the Fires of London.   The most startlingly original piece of music theatre I\u2019d ever seen performed with astonishing virtuosity. Forty years later, the experience is still vivid and immediate in my memory, unsurpassed for its originality.  Alastair Middleton Startling indeed. Judge for yourself:       Jesus Hopped the A Train, 2001 Play written by Stephen Adly Guirgis and directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman.  I was electrified by the sheer visceral sucker punch of Philip Seymour Hoffman\u2019s production about Rikers Island convicts on death row. The final moments \u2013 when Angel Cruz not only accepts his guilt but also seeks forgiveness for the small, irrelevant failings of his past \u2013 deeply moved me and changed me.  Patrick Ward \u2022 What we said: \u201cStephen Adly Guirgis\u2019s play never quite escapes the bars that this kind of intense prison drama puts around itself, but its aggressive, high-octane style is like a shot of caffeine straight in the veins. And Philip Seymour Hoffman\u2019s beautifully judged production allows a group of A-list actors to flesh out the deficiencies in the characterisation.\u201d Swan Lake rehearsal, 1984  Managed to sneak in to The Playhouse and see Nureyev rehearsing Swan Lake in 1984 \u2013 my 20th birthday.

My friend Shelley had bought me a ticket for the performance later on in the day but for some reason \u2013 may be to pick up the tickets \u2013 we sneaked into The Playhouse earlier on and found him rehearsing Swan Lake with his fellow swans. It was amazing. One of those precious forbidden moments that stays with you forever. Years later, on a delayed flight from Melbourne to Bangkok, I found myself sitting next to Nureyev in the departure lounge.

Flight of the Conchords, 2002  Back in 2002, as a student at Glasgow University, my brother and I caught the Megabus through to Edinburgh on a whim to catch a comedy show at the festival. We\u2019d done no research whatsoever and were complete festival virgins. We found ourselves outside the Gilded Balloon and glanced down a long list of performers\u2019 names that meant absolutely nothing to us, and finally picked something called Flight of the Conchords, because we \u201cliked the name\u201d. Of course, Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement\u2019s show Folk the World was hilarious. My brother and I left with enough in-jokes about Kiwi faux-folk to sustain us for years. In fact, we were still singing lines of their songs to each other when HBO picked them up in 2007 and they became the world\u2019s favourite comedians.  As a festival wildcard, this was a massive success.

The National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), headed by Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha - who took control of Thailand in a bloodless military coup in May - unveiled plans this week connecting the northern border town of Nong Khai with Map Ta Phut, located south-east of Bangkok. Chaing Khong, just south of the Laos capital Vientiane, will also be connected to Ban Phachi, in the central Ayutthaya regions. The railway lines will link up directly to Kunming, in China&apos;s southern Yunnan province, in what analysts have termed Chinese &quot;high-speed railway diplomacy&quot;. China is looking to build a 3,000km (1,860m) high-speed line from Kunming all the way down to Singapore, passing through Laos, Thailand and Malaysia \u2014 a project that would increase China&apos;s GDP and those of the involved nations by $375b, a former Chinese railway chairman told the China Daily. According to China Railway Corp, it appears the Kunming-Singapore line will be constructed in four stages, from Kunming to Vientiane, Vientiane to Bangkok, Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur, and Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. Construction of the Thai lines is planned to begin next year as part of the new eight-year 741.4 billion baht ($23.3bn) infrastructure development project connecting Bangkok and other key cities with airports, seaports, border areas and cargo depots, the Bangkok Post reported, with some 106 new trains added to the existing fleet. Six dual-track railway lines will also be constructed under the same scheme. The two routes comprise nearly 1,400km in total but unlike many other high-speed trains, which generally run at a speed of 200 km per hour, will only be able to run at 160 km per hour until further investment would allow a higher-speed system.     Map of the planned route     Chinese officials involved in the project have described the deal as a major scoop for the Chinese government, which had earlier struck a deal with former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra \u2014 only to see the project initially rejected by the junta when it came to power. Now the military government has approved the project, &quot;there will be huge room for cooperation [between China and Thailand],&quot; Yang Yong of the China Railway Corp told China Daily, adding that Chinese engineers had been involved in feasibility research for the high-speed lines, and Chinese companies were directly helping to modernise Thailand&apos;s railway system.

Pattaramon, who was already a mother to two children, said: &quot;Why does he have to be abandoned while the other baby has it easy? I feel sorry for him. I don&apos;t know what to do. I chose to have him, not to hurt him. I love him. He was in my tummy for nine months, it&apos;s like my child. I treat him like my other children, never think you are not my child and I don&apos;t care for you, never.&quot; She added: &quot;They [the surrogacy agency] told me to carry a baby for a family that does not have children ... They said it would be a baby in a tube. The money that was offered was a lot for me. In my mind, with that money, one, we can educate my children, two, we can repay our debt.&quot; The Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, described the case as an &quot;incredibly sad story&quot;. He said: &quot;I guess it illustrates some of the pitfalls involved in this particular [surrogacy] business.&quot; Abbott said he was yet to be briefed on the matter, but added he would look at &quot;what might be possible&quot; to help the boy. The Hope for Gammy campaign page carries dozens of comments expressing outrage and disbelief at Gammy&apos;s parents. &quot;The healthy baby should be taken away from those monsters,&quot; said one. &quot;They obviously have no human compassion.&quot; Another said: &quot;May this selfish and heartless couple be exposed and shamed for this horrible neglect!&quot; Commercial surrogacy, in which a woman is paid to carry a child, is illegal in Australia, but couples are allowed to use an altruistic surrogate \u2013 who receives no payment apart from medical and other reasonable expenses. A Thai public health ministry official, Tares Krassanairawiwong, confirmed that paying for surrogacy was also illegal in Thailand. &quot;Surrogacy can be done in Thailand, but it has to comply with the laws,&quot; she said. &quot;A surrogate has to be related to the intended parents and no money can be involved.&quot; According to the support group Surrogacy Australia, outrage over Gammy&apos;s story could lead to a complete ban on international surrogacy in Australia, where more couples choose to go overseas than find an altruistic surrogate at home. &quot;It&apos;s just much easier overseas,&quot; its chief executive Rachel Kunde told Agence France-Presse. &quot;There&apos;s so much red tape involved [in Australia].&quot; Kunde added that the details of the latest case were not clear and claimed it was not known whether the Australian couple involved had been told that the boy was alive. &quot;Our greatest fear is that Australia is going to ban international surrogacy altogether,&quot; she said. &quot;We are hoping that the government will make accessing surrogates in Australia easier.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-08-02T11:42:36Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Australia news", "Down's syndrome", "Health", "Society", "Surrogacy"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/02/hope-for-gammy-raises-90k-baby-downs-syndrome-abandoned-thailand", "title": "'Hope for Gammy' raises \u00a390k for baby with Down's syndrome left in Thailand", "sentences": ["Pattaramon Chanbua, from Chonburi province, south-east of Bangkok, had agreed via an agent to be a surrogate for the couple&apos;s twins, who were born in December, for a fee of \u00a38,850."]}, {"article": "Surrogacy campaigners have called for clearer regulations after claims by a Thai woman that she was left with a baby with Down&apos;s syndrome after his Australian parents refused to take him but instead took his healthy twin sister. An online campaign to raise funds for urgent medical treatment for the seven-month old boy, named Gammy, reached \u00a3175,000 as fears were expressed that the case could lead to Australia banning international surrogacy. Australia&apos;s department of foreign affairs is examining the Thai surrogacy trade. &quot;The Australian government agencies are examining these issues in consultation with authorities in Thailand,&quot; a spokesman said at the weekend. The baby has a congenital heart condition and a lung infection as well as Down&apos;s syndrome. Doctors at the Samithivej hospital in Bangkok, where the boy is being treated, said his breathing had since improved. Donations are being handled by the Australian charity Hands Across the Water. His mother, Pattaramon Chanbua, a food stall worker, said she was paid $15,000 (\u00a39,000) to be a surrogate. The Thai newspaper Thairath, which first reported the story, said Pattaramon had never met the Australian couple, whose identities remain unknown but are said to be from western Australia. Pattaramon, 21, who has two other children, said in a television interview: &quot;Only the agency doctors and his parents knew that he had Down&apos;s syndrome from the fourth month. But during the seventh month of pregnancy the agency called me and told me that the parents wanted me to terminate the child because he has Down&apos;s syndrome.

Commercial surrogacy, in which a woman is paid to carry a child, is not permitted in Australia, with money limited to the costs of medical and other reasonable expenses, leading to many couples choosing to go abroad, with Thailand and India among the most popular destinations.

She works on a food stall in a small seaside town south-east of Bangkok. It is an extremely hard existence. When offered A$16,000 (\u00a39,000) to become a surrogate mother for an Australian couple she saw a way out: \u201cThe money that was offered was a lot for me. In my mind, with that money, one, we can educate my children; two, we can repay our debt.\u201d We only know about her because of a baby boy called Gammy, one of the twins she gave birth to seven months ago. Gammy has Down\u2019s syndrome and a congenital heart condition, and according to Chanbua, the Australian parents took Gammy\u2019s twin sister but left him. The outrage this has provoked has resulted in donations being made online to fund medical care for Gammy. The couple in question deny this version of events, saying that the surrogacy agency \u2013 organised out of a house in Bangkok \u2013 only knew that there was a baby girl, and did not know she had a twin brother. They have described the situation as \u201ctraumatising\u201d. Indeed. For now, Chanbua and her mother are caring for the \u201cunwanted\u201d child. All of this is heart-rending: fertility tourism at its worst. In countries where there is very little regulation I suspect there are a lot more stories like this. Many couples travel to Thailand for IVF and surrogacy, which the Thai authorities are now saying is illegal but has clearly been thriving. Surrogacy is a moral and legal minefield. In the UK it is legal, but with the vague and strange proviso that no money other than \u201creasonable expenses\u201d should pass hands, with an agreement drawn up by individuals. Rebekah Brooks had her baby this way. Many European countries ban it outright, and in the US laws vary dramatically from state to state. California is known to be surrogate friendly, drawing up gestational contracts, regardless of a person\u2019s marital status or sexual orientation. These contracts establish the legal parentage prior to birth so that no adoption proceedings are necessary. This is the liberal ideology in full flow, with a baby as a consumer choice. It appears to work well for various celebrities. Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick used surrogates, as did Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban. Kidman, in bizarre celeb speak, expressed her gratitude to \u201cin particular our gestational carrier\u201d. Yes, that makes me queasy. A woman as mere gestational carrier: the renting of wombs. What is wrong with adoption? Well, many couples become too old to be considered as adoptive parents, and others clearly want a genetic link to their desired baby. Male gay couples need to hire surrogates \u2013 although, again, I would prefer that adoption was made easier for them. For all the Californication of this complicated exchange, the case of Gammy highlights exactly what is wrong with the whole process. The surrogate did not appear to understand the reality of what she was doing \u2013 she has said that the surrogacy agency suggested that \u201cit would be a baby in a tube\u201d; and that the parents were paying for a healthy child, not \u201cdamaged goods\u201d. One may argue that a woman has every right to do what she wants with her own body. This is an argument that is regularly made about sex work but so often ignores the context in which women make those choices. Thailand, which now has to be seen as cracking down on surrogacy arrangements and sex-selective IVF, is full of young women prepared to sell their bodies. So is India, which is now emerging as the hub of fertility tourism. It is low cost there, and the packages which are offered include the fertility treatment, the surrogacy fee, the cost of delivery and the flights. Poor Indian women will rent their wombs to richer, infertile couples. Go online now and you can look at the competitive prices. This is global capitalism in action. It is a twisted version of slavery, in which the bodies of impoverished women are disposable receptacles for the privileged. Sure, I have read tabloid stories about happy surrogates: women who just love being pregnant and can\u2019t wait to serve up a baby for a fee. But little Gammy reminds us what this trade is really about: the actual value of the surrogate. All of it is repulsive, and the reaction of those who have donated money to help this child tells us you do not have to give birth to a baby to want to care for it. Trading wombs and babies on the free market devalues women. It devalues life.", "publicationDate": "2014-08-04T12:07:25Z", "tags": ["Surrogacy", "Women", "Pregnancy", "Parents and parenting", "Australia news", "Asia Pacific", "Thailand", "India", "Life and style", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/04/baby-gammy-thailand-surrogacy-repulsive-trade-pattaramon-chanbua", "title": "The case of baby Gammy shows surrogacy for the repulsive trade it is | Suzanne Moore", "sentences": ["She works on a food stall in a small seaside town south-east of Bangkok.", "The couple in question deny this version of events, saying that the surrogacy agency \u2013 organised out of a house in Bangkok \u2013 only knew that there was a baby girl, and did not know she had a twin brother."]}, {"article": "The Australian government has suggested that a child apparently abandoned to its surrogate mother in Thailand after being born with Down&apos;s syndrome may be given Australian citizenship. The seven-month-old child, who is currently in hospital in Thailand for treatment of a life-threatening lung infection and will need further operations for a heart condition, has sparked a worldwide debate on the rules surrounding international surrogacy. Pattaramon Chanbua, a 21-year-old foodseller in the coastal town of Sri Racha, is taking care of the boy, named Gammy, after an Australian couple, who have not been identified by the media, took his healthy twin sister back to their home in Western Australia. Hundreds of thousands of pounds have been raised for the child via a viral online campaign since the story emerged. Australia&apos;s immigration minister, Scott Morrison, told Sydney Radio 2GB on Monday that Pattaramon was &quot;an absolute hero&quot; and &quot;a saint&quot;, and that the law surrounding the case was &quot;very, very murky&quot;. &quot;We are taking a close look at what can be done here, but I wouldn&apos;t want to raise any false hopes or expectations,&quot; he said. &quot;We are dealing with something that has happened in another country&apos;s jurisdiction.&quot; Morrison&apos;s office later said in a statement that &quot;the child may be eligible for Australian citizenship&quot;. It is unclear if the Australian couple actually abandoned the child, as previous reports have suggested. Pattaramon has told journalists she was asked to abort her son after it was discovered he had Down&apos;s syndrome, and that the parents, from Bunbury, 171km south of Perth, would only take his healthy twin sister. The parents told the ABC 7.30 programme that they had no knowledge of Gammy and were preparing to release a statement through their lawyers on Monday night, as media camped outside their home. Pattaramon, however, who gave birth to twins after agreeing to be a surrogate for the couple, has said they saw Gammy in hospital. She said the agency organising the surrogacy knew about Gammy&apos;s condition four to five months after she became pregnant, but did not tell her. When it suggested in her seventh month of pregnancy that she should abort one of the twins, she refused. She was promised A$16,000 (\u00a38,900), but has yet to see all of the money. &quot;If they don&apos;t know about the twin, they wouldn&apos;t be crying the day after they took the girl out of the hospital and home to Australia,&quot; she told ABC. &quot;They probably would have not asked me to have a abortion if they truly don&apos;t know [about the twin with Down&apos;s syndrome].&quot; ABC said it had spoken to the biological parents, who were still claiming never to have seen Gammy, twice at their home. They reportedly said: &quot;We saw a few people at the hospital. We didn&apos;t know who the surrogate was. It was very confusing. There was a language barrier.&quot; Pattaramon, who lives 90km south of Bangkok with her six-year-old son and three-year-old daughter, said she would raise Gammy as if the boy was her own. &quot;I love him,&quot; she said. &quot;He was in my tummy for nine months. It is like my child. I love him like my own. I treat him like any other children.&quot; An online campaign called Hope for Gammy, administered by the Australian charity Hands Across the Water, has raised around $220,000 to help Gammy since 22 July. Mora Kelly, the founder of the Children First Foundation, which brings sick children from developing countries to Australia for medical treatment, said she had discussed bringing Gammy to Melbourne for heart surgery with Hands Across the Water. &quot;I believe that this child should be able to access our healthcare system here in Australia,&quot; she told ABC. &quot;This child, in essence \u2026 should be an Australian citizen.&quot; It is illegal to pay a surrogate mother in Australia, and in some states, not including Western Australia, it is illegal to pay a surrogate living overseas. An Australian woman can act as a surrogate for free, but also has the right to keep the child rather than hand it over to the biological parents. Richard Perrins, a solicitor specialising in surrogacy at Natalie Gamble Associates, said an increasing number of couples were looking for surrogate mothers overseas because of the difficulty in finding one in their own country. In the UK surrogacy is legal, but a couple can only pay &quot;reasonable expenses&quot; to a surrogate mother. &quot;The most popular countries are the US where it is legal in some states, India, Ukraine and now this case in Thailand has been publicised,&quot; Perrins said. &quot;There is a push for more regulation in this area, because if it was clearer where people stand both parties would be more at ease.&quot; Gammy&apos;s case was rare, he added. &quot;In general, people have very positive outcomes from surrogacy. More often than not, it doesn&apos;t go wrong.&quot;", "publicationDate": "2014-08-04T13:09:50Z", "tags": ["Australia news", "Surrogacy", "Pregnancy", "Parents and parenting", "Life and style", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Thailand"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/04/baby-gammy-australian-citizenship-government-suggests", "title": "Baby Gammy may be given Australian citizenship, government suggests", "sentences": ["There was a language barrier.&quot; Pattaramon, who lives 90km south of Bangkok with her six-year-old son and three-year-old daughter, said she would raise Gammy as if the boy was her own."]}, {"article": "23 Love Lane This tasteful 200-year-old mansion is an oasis of calm right in the heart of bustling George Town.

It\u2019s very easy to become paranoid when you\u2019re in Edinburgh and to think that everything, even the weather, is about you. It isn\u2019t. Nothing\u2019s about you. Apart from the reviews, of course. They\u2019re all about you! It\u2019s of crucial importance both to your mental wellbeing and to those around you that you try to maintain a certain level of equanimity. Do normal things. Talk about things other than the festival. Eat properly. Don\u2019t drink too much. Look at wondrous Arthur\u2019s Seat, which, if you don\u2019t know Edinburgh, is a magnificent dormant volcano \u2013 or massive hill \u2013 bang in the centre of Edinburgh. It\u2019s breathtaking and magical and awe-inspiring). Don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking it\u2019s a legendary, bespoke toilet belonging to the English alternative comedian and veteran fringe-goer Arthur Smith, on loan to the National Museum of Scotland during the festival, and go in there asking to see it. The staff wouldn\u2019t appreciate that at all, especially this close to the\u00a0referendum. Anyway, I\u2019m very lucky. Since 2007 I\u2019ve always had a child with me at the festival. My own child, I mean \u2013 I don\u2019t rent someone else\u2019s when I get up here to keep things in perspective.     When you\u2019re in Edinburgh, don\u2019t forget to take in the view of Arthur\u2019s Seat. Photograph: Murdo Macleod    Although I do think that\u2019s a good idea. If Edinburgh parents start doing that, I want my cut. Children are not only great levellers, they\u2019re also brilliant fun. I have two now and I love being at the festival with them. My son saw a man dressed up as Margaret Thatcher the other night and said: \u201cIs he in The Ladyboys of Bangkok, Mummy?\u201d I prepared as much as I possibly could for this year\u2019s show. I had a good run last year \u2013 for the first time in 10 years people came, and I didn\u2019t want to disappoint them in case they came back. This year feels different. I have to think about the structure of this show very carefully because it covers some difficult issues. I didn\u2019t have to do that so much with last year\u2019s show, A Bic for Her. It was pretty much one routine shouted after another, with a serious bit at the end. It was easier to write and easier to learn. This one has routines within routines, and I can\u2019t get the order wrong otherwise the whole thing falls apart. It occurred to me at the beginning of the run that if something spontaneous happened in the room, at a crucial moment, I\u2019d have to go all the way back to the beginning again. Like when my son gets distracted by a fly while we\u2019re doing his times tables. \u201cWhere was I\u00a0again? Argh! We\u2019ll have to go back to\u00a0the beginning now. 1 x 2 is 2. 2 x 2 is 4. 3 x 2 is ...\u201d I\u2019m not very good at\u00a0maths. Still, the shows have gone down fine so that\u2019s a relief. The only slightly dodgy one I\u2019ve had was on Saturday. Saturdays are always a bit odd. The audience haven\u2019t necessarily come to see you, but to see \u201csome comedy\u201d and you might not be their idea of comedy, which I wasn\u2019t, and I can completely understand that. I\u2019m not even my idea of comedy.

I was on board the polar research ship, the Akademik Sergey Vavilov. The vessel, though under Russian command, had been hired by a Canada-based adventure-tourism company for its Arctic excursions. We were at breakfast when John, our rugged Australian expedition leader, told us over the ship\u2019s public address system that a bear had been sighted on land. We were crossing the mouth of one of the westerly fjords of Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean.  \u201cGet your life jackets on,\u201d he urged. \u201cGangway, 9am.\u201d Our Zodiac inflatables, each carrying 10 passengers, cruised parallel to the rocky coast. We looked at the bear and the bear looked right back at us. Once or twice, he lifted his head, half raising his torso, before lying down again.  \u201cThis bear\u2019s doing what a bear is meant to do,\u201d said our guide Cecilia. \u201cHe\u2019s lying down, conserving energy. If you see polar bears walking around, that means they\u2019re hungry and looking for food.\u201d About 3,000 polar bears live in Svalbard, out of an estimated worldwide total of 20,000. They need ice to survive \u2014 it\u2019s where they find the seals that constitute their main food source. For the past couple of years, though, the ice, which in winter used to cover most of the sea around Svalbard, hasn\u2019t arrived. \u201cYou can\u2019t be sure it\u2019s down to global warming,\u201d Cecilia said. \u201cBut the reality is that there are some very hungry bears around.\u201d Last month, the scientific council of the United Nations Environment Programme\u2019s Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) gave its positive advice on a Norwegian proposal to list the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) under the convention. In the explanatory document, Norway observes that the polar bear is indeed a migratory species, falling within the ambit of CMS. Of the 19 subpopulations (spread out between five countries, at least eight directly overlap two or more national jurisdictions, thus qualifying them for protection under the CMS. Norway points out that climate change is emerging as the most far-reaching and significant stressor on Arctic biodiversity, including polar bear populations. But contaminants also play a part. Many pollutants reach high levels in polar bears due to their high fat diet and high position in the food chain. A number of the organochlorine pollutants are lipophilic; that is, they are deposited in the fat of the animals that consume them. Because animals in the Arctic marine ecosystem are highly dependent on fat for storing energy, growth, insulation and buoyancy, these pollutants are rapidly accumulated progressively up the food chain. In proposing the listing of the polar bear under the CMS, Norway argues that, given the pressures polar bears already face, it makes sense for the range states to agree, within the CMS framework, on some specific protection measures.   Increasing activities of Arctic industries, such as petroleum or increased shipping activities, have significant potential to place a further burden on subpopulations already weakened by the cumulative impacts of habitat destruction. As such, there is an urgent need to discuss mitigation of these impacts before they become entrenched and the solutions more difficult to find.\u201d  Norway notes that in the Norwegian Arctic and Russia, polar bears are protected from all forms of harvest except problem or defence kills, although poaching is, apparently, a significant conservation issue in Russia. There is, however, a legal \u201charvest\u201d of polar bears in Greenland, the US and Canada.  Some 600 of these bears enter each year into international trade. To the disappointment of many, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), at its last meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, in March 2013, failed to agree on a ban on international trade in polar bear products.  The failure \u2013 for the time being - to agree measures in Cites does not, of course, preclude important action being taken under CMS now. Such measures might, inter alia, relate to habitat protection, or the regulation of shipping or the exploitation of resources such as oil, so as to minimise the impact on polar bear populations. The 11th conference of the parties to the CMS (COP 11) will take place in Quito, Ecuador, at the beginning of November. The protection of polar bears is not, of course, the only major issue on the table. There are also important proposals for the protection of sharks and rays, and all species of sawfish, as well as lions, and the great bustard. There are also action plans to be approved for the Argali sheep, Pacific loggerhead turtle and the endangered Saker falcon. Remembering as vividly as I do my Svalbard trip last year and those close encounters with polar bears (we saw five altogether) I have, of course, a particular interest in the Norwegian proposal. \u201cIconic\u201d may be an overused word. But if the polar bear is not an iconic species, worth protecting by all means, I don\u2019t know what is.

Instead of the UK releasing albums on Monday, the United States on Tuesday, Australia and Germany on Friday, and so on, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry is reportedly moving toward a unified worldwide streetdate of Friday. According to Billboard, executives in the major territories and at the major labels want to be able to stage simultaneous international releases. They hope to reboot the system in July 2015, after which record shops from Birmingham to Boston and Bangkok will all put out their new albums each Friday. Piracy is the main reason for this change. Often, new releases go on sale first in Australia on Friday, four days before the same music becomes available in the US. If tracks are leaked onto file-sharing networks, that\u2019s four days that American fans are asked to await the domestic streetdate. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s surprise album release, last December, is also being cited as a main reason for this change. By becoming available for purchase everywhere at once, the singer\u2019s fifth long-player benefited from a huge, worldwide response, breaking an iTunes sales record. Despite the enthusiasm from some quarters, changing the streetdate in markets like the UK and US will require lots of planning, as well as cooperation across disparate parts of the music and retail industries, including warehousing, transport and record shops.

Mitsutoki Shigeta, 24, who is Japanese, fled Thailand for Macau last week after his apartment in Bangkok was raided by the authorities, who were alerted by a tip-off from neighbours. Police found nine surrogate babies, aged six months to a year, with their nannies, and a pregnant surrogate mother, in the apartment. Later DNA tests demonstrated that Shigeta was the father. Additional birth certificates showed that Shigeta had fathered another six children in Thailand. Thai police said they thought that Shigeta, who is from a wealthy family, could have been involved in trafficking his own children. They have requested help from the Japanese authorities to find him. His activity was reported to the authorities by at least one surrogate agency over the past two years, according to Mariam Kukunashvili, of the New Life Global Network, an international group of fertility centres. She told Thai media that her agency had provided two surrogate mothers to Shigeta in 2012, one of whom gave birth to twins, but found the number of his commissions suspicious. &quot;We served Shigeta one time only and then he demanded he wanted more and more babies,&quot; Kukunashvili told the Bangkok Post. &quot;I immediately found it suspicious, especially for a man of his age, and we refused to further serve him and warned Interpol, the BBC, CNN and the Japanese embassy.&quot; Kukunashvili claims that she learned, while the surrogates were pregnant, that Shigeta had recruited an additional three surrogate mothers from another agency to carry more babies. She was curious as to why he was so keen to father so many children; in response Shigeta, she said, suggested it was so he could &quot;have a big family for voting and win an election in Japan&quot;. Shigeta&apos;s lawyer has denied allegations of human trafficking and says his client, who has another three children in Japan, merely wanted the children so that he could pass on his &quot;business and fortune&quot;. Shigeta \u2013 who is believed to own a flat in Hong Kong \u2013 is a stakeholder in the German company behind a mobile phone app that allows parents to track their children&apos;s movements, the South China Morning Post has reported. Shigeta travelled frequently in and out of Thailand and took four of his babies to Cambodia this year, Thai police said. The remaining 11 children are now being cared for in a government home in Thailand. The IVF clinic that Shigeta used has been closed. This potential surrogacy scandal comes after the case of an Australian couple accused of abandoning their son, Gammy, who has Down&apos;s syndrome, with his Thai surrogate mother, raising questions about Thailand&apos;s open surrogacy laws and about children being vulnerable to human trafficking.

ABC reported that two Australian homosexual couples and two American couples were stopped by police at Bangkok airport on Thursday afternoon amid plans by the country to overhaul its surrogacy laws. On Wednesday, Thailand\u2019s military government gave preliminary approval for a draft law making commercial surrogacy a criminal offence, largely due to an international outcry over the case of an Australian couple accused of abandoning their baby with Down\u2019s syndrome, known as Gammy, to his surrogate mother. The West Australian couple took Gammy\u2019s healthy twin sister home. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has urged Thai authorities to allow a transitional period for the new laws so that Australians already into the surrogacy process are not unduly affected. \u201cWe strongly urge Australians entering Thailand for the purposes of commercial surrogacy to seek independent legal advice in both Thailand and Australia before doing so,\u201d a department spokeswoman said following reports of couples being stopped. \u201cIn particular, they should seek advice on the implications of any new exit requirements.\u201d The department would not be releasing names of Australian couples stopped at the airport, she said. In a statement posted on their closed Facebook group wall, Surrogacy Australia said it would not be commenting on the situation to the media, but more than 200 couples might be affected, SBS reported. The couples would now have to face the Thai family court, which traditionally rules in such cases that children should stay with their birth mother, leading Australian surrogacy lawyer Stephen Page said. The Gammy case had revealed to Thai authorities how fraught surrogacy arrangements without strong judicial oversight from the outset were and had embarrassed them internationally, he said, prompting their swift reaction. \u201cBut that couples are now being stopped at the airport is extraordinary,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s really concerning is the Thai government has changed the rules halfway through the game and virtually overnight, these couples who had gone into this process in good faith now find themselves pawns in a disastrous game.\u201d To avoid a repeat of the Gammy case, he said Australian legislation that criminalised commercial surrogacy in all jurisdictions but the Northern Territory, and which was often discriminatory, needed to be overhauled. Australian couples chose Bangkok in large numbers because it was close, was perceived as cheaper, and until recently had not sought to ban commercial surrogacy, he said. \u201cThe first thing we need is a strong framework of international law so everyone knows what\u2019s up and we don\u2019t have this vague situation like in Thailand or India where the rules suddenly get changed,\u201d Page said. \u201cCertainly the leading players in the commercial surrogacy field include the US, who act from a human rights and feminist perspective with their laws. \u201cAbove all, their surrogacy laws have a strong judicial oversight and I can\u2019t emphasise the importance of that enough.\u201d Changes to Australian commercial surrogacy laws could be driven by a Hague convention specifically relating to surrogacy, he said. The Hague convention \u201cprotects children and their families against the risks of illegal, irregular, premature or ill-prepared adoptions\u201d overseas. It\u2019s a suggestion echoed by the attorney general, George Brandis, who on Thursday released a report on parentage and the family law act calling for a coordinated international response to overseas surrogacy arrangements. \u201cCouncil believes this issue requires a coordinated international regulatory response of the kind embodied in the Hague Adoption Convention,\u201d the report said. Page said the Gammy case almost guaranteed that the next special commission of the Hague Conference\u2019s Convention on Intercountry Adoption in 2015 would adopt a convention on surrogacy. On Friday, research released in the Medical Journal of Australia found that legislation criminalising compensated surrogacy was doing little to stop Australian would-be parents entering into arrangements with overseas surrogates. The authors called for an urgent review of surrogacy-related laws following an anonymous online survey of 259 intended parents in partnership with Surrogacy Australia. Only 9% of respondents were deterred by laws criminalising commercial surrogacy arrangements overseas, researchers found, and 44% never considered uncompensated, or altruistic, surrogacy. This was where the surrogate mother was only reimbursed for out-of-pocket medical costs associated with pregnancy and birth. \u201cThe high proportion of intended parents using overseas instead of domestic surrogacy arrangements shows that Australian public policy in this area is failing,\u201d the study said. \u201cIt appears that the drive to have a child for people who need surrogacy is greater than the barriers erected by Australian legislators.\u201d But the medical director of IVF Australia, Dr Peter Illingworth, said overseas surrogacy arrangements were complex and fraught with risk. Australian couples had to hand their embryo over to people who were usually complete strangers, he said, and there was a perception that rich people were paying poor people to take health risks on their behalf. \u201cAny pregnancy carries risk and while most are safe and happy events, there are of course complication risks,\u201d Illingworth said. \u201cWhat we need to do is see what we can do to make surrogacy more practical for people who need to use it in Australia.\u201d In Australia, altruistic surrogacy was restricted to women without a uterus, those medically unfit and unable to carry a pregnancy to full-term, and to same sex couples. There were about 100 such cases each year, he said. Would-be parents often felt insecure throughout the pregnancy of the surrogate, he said, because legal arrangements about parentage of the child were not finalised until after the birth. \u201cThis creates great uncertainty for all participants in the surrogacy process. \u201cSurrogate law could be improved in Australia by giving parents more certainty by sorting out legal arrangements from the very beginning.\u201d The press officer for the ambassador of Thailand, Maris Sangiampongsa, did not return calls from Guardian Australia requesting comment.", "publicationDate": "2014-08-15T04:48:35Z", "tags": ["Australia news", "Thailand", "Surrogacy", "Parents and parenting", "Asia Pacific", "Family", "Pregnancy"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/15/australian-couples-hit-thai-surrogacy-ban", "title": "Australians hit by Thai surrogacy ban are 'pawns in a disastrous game'", "sentences": ["ABC reported that two Australian homosexual couples and two American couples were stopped by police at Bangkok airport on Thursday afternoon amid plans by the country to overhaul its surrogacy laws.", "Australian couples chose Bangkok in large numbers because it was close, was perceived as cheaper, and until recently had not sought to ban commercial surrogacy, he said."]}, {"article": "Thai authorities are now asking all foreign couples leaving the country with surrogate children to produce proof of custody after a recent spate of surrogacy scandals has forced police to clamp down on the largely unregulated industry. The news follows the detention of four couples \u2013 two Australian and two American \u2013 who tried to fly out of Bangkok this week but were held by immigration authorities amid sudden plans to overhaul existing surrogacy laws. Thai immigration police told the Australian federal police on Friday that they had detained a same-sex Australian couple flying to Singapore because &quot;they didn&apos;t have documents to prove that the father is the child&apos;s legal guardian&quot;. Authorities told the couple they needed a court order before they would be permitted to leave the kingdom. According to ABC reports, the couple have now been able to leave the country with their newborn twins who were born last month via a surrogate and have arrived in Singapore. It is understood several other couples remain in Thailand and are speaking with the Australian embassy in Bangkok to try to resolve their cases. It is unclear just how many other couples of other nationalities may have been detained under similar circumstances. A US embassy spokesperson in Bangkok told the Guardian on Friday that &quot;some parents with children born via surrogacy have not been permitted to exit [Thailand]&quot; but would not clarify the exact number, while the UK embassy in Bangkok said that they had not received any requests for guidance regarding surrogacy. Up to 200 Australian couples may be affected by Thailand&apos;s new regulations, effectively rendering them &quot;pawns in a disastrous game&quot;, a leading surrogacy lawyer told the Guardian. It is believed that around 150 surrogate babies are currently in Thailand, ostensibly waiting to be taken out of the country by their biological parents. On Wednesday, Thailand&apos;s military government gave preliminary approval for a draft law making commercial surrogacy a criminal offence, largely due to an international outcry over the case of an Australian couple accused of abandoning their baby boy, called Gammy, after finding out he had Down&apos;s syndrome. The Western Australian couple took Gammy&apos;s healthy twin sister home. The new law \u2013 which authorities expect to ratify by the end of the year \u2013 would allow only legally married couples to file for parental rights of a child born to a surrogate mother. It is not clear whether individuals, unmarried or same-sex couples, would be able to take part in surrogacy agreements, but as gay marriage is not recognised in Thailand, it does not seem likely. Australia&apos;s department of foreign affairs and trade has urged Thai authorities to allow a transitional period so that Australians already into the surrogacy process are not penalised.

During the competition, the team uploaded a picture of themselves at the tournament\u2019s opening ceremony to Facebook, and controversy ensued. \u201cTeam South Africa wearing Palestinian badges and Keffiyehs to show our opposition to the human rights violations carried out against the people of Palestine,\u201d they posted. The debating team\u2019s captain, Joshua Broomberg, is the deputy head boy of a prestigious Jewish school in Johannesburg. That sent the online commenters into apoplexy. Threats of violence were made against the students. Although South Africa has long had a strongly pro-Israel Jewish community, despite the African National Congress government increasingly opposing Israeli militarism and occupation, there are growing splits within the tight, Zionist enclave. Over 500 prominent Jews signed a statement a few weeks ago that read:  Just as we resist antisemitism, we refuse to dehumanise Palestinians in order to make their deaths lighter on our collective conscience. We sign this statement in order to affirm their humanity and our own. We distance ourselves from South African Jewish organizations whose blind support for Israel\u2019s disproportionate actions moves us further from a just resolution to the conflict.  In the global Jewish diaspora, dissent against Israel of this magnitude is a relatively new phenomenon. Although support for the Jewish state has been an unofficial second religion for Jews for decades \u2013 in my own family it was simply expected that Israel would be uncritically backed in times of war and peace, with Palestinians demonised as unreasonable and violent \u2013 times are changing. This doesn\u2019t please some of the loudest Jewish voices. Conservative writer Shmuel Rosner argued in the New York Times in early August that liberal critics of Israel were severing familial ties. \u201cIf all Jews are a family\u201d, he wrote, \u201cit would be natural for Israelis to expect the unconditional love of their non-Israeli Jewish kin.\u201d \u201cIf Jews aren\u2019t a family,\u201d he continued, \u201cand their support can be withdrawn, then Israelis have no reason to pay special attention to the complaints of non-Israeli Jews.\u201d Rosner believes that Israel will survive without liberal Jewish backing but surely even he recognises that Israel isn\u2019t an island, and without strong support from America \u2013 diplomatically, financially and militarily \u2013 the Jewish state is isolated and increasingly alone. Rosner knows that Jewish diaspora support for Israel is vital if the Jewish state is to perpetuate its nearly 50-year occupation of Palestinian lands. The standard tools used to silence skeptical Jews, including those in the diaspora \u2013 false allegations of self-hatred and antisemitism, accusations of backing Hamas - are less effective today. Israel can\u2019t rely on diaspora support while hardline Zionists criticise diaspora Jewish voices for an apparently insufficient knowledge of Israeli politics or Hebrew, either.  In reality, despite what Israel supporters claim, the conflict isn\u2019t complicated; occupation never is. Critics have been stripped of their power by the sheer scale of the Israeli invasion in Gaza, and the searing images of death and destruction, which are forcing even the most dedicated Israel backers to question the tactic of collective punishment. In the US, Israel\u2019s chief backer, support for Israel is flagging. The numbers don\u2019t lie; a recent Gallup poll in the US found that Democrat voters and youth were much less likely to endorse Israel\u2019s actions than the general US population, and a key sample of congressional staffers agreed that \u201cIsrael attacked Gaza in a wild overreaction\u201d. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee understands the \u201cvulnerability\u201d of progressive support for Israel in the diaspora. Funding for young Jews to embrace Israel has been ramped up and \u201cbirthright\u201d trips are still ongoing, despite the conflict. But as one Rabbi noted, \u201cThis is a hard time to go and make that deep connection that we seek to make [on trips to Israel] ... you are not going to see the Israel I saw when I was there in June. It really is different. It changed overnight\u201d. Even the free trips are losing their effectiveness, and little wonder: a recent video, filmed at the Western Wall, shows how some young Israelis consider \u201canother war, and another war, and another war\u201d in Gaza to be normal. The Jewish diaspora has long been relied upon to endorse and fund Israeli actions. Zionist leaders from my home country, Australia, are this month welcoming one of the most senior members of the Israeli government: Avigdor Lieberman, the foreign minister, who advocates the total separation of Palestinians and Jews inside Israel, and wants \u201cloyalty oaths\u201d for Arab-Israeli citizens. The visit is already being hailed as \u201ca wonderful reflection of the standing of the Australian Jewish community within the leadership of the Israeli government.\u201d The feeling is mutual. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, wrote a letter to diaspora Jews this month thanking them for \u201cstanding by Israel\u201d:  The support of Jewish communities around the world has been a source of great strength for the people of Israel \u2026 Many of you have had to face aggressive protesters, and even violent antisemitism \u2026 Israel will, for its part, continue standing at your side, as you deal with hatred and intolerance. Jews everywhere should be able to live with pride, not fear. I have great faith in the Jewish people and in the justice of our cause.  While Israel doesn\u2019t attract the same degree of support, some blind, it once enjoyed, the extent of dissent shouldn\u2019t be exaggerated. Netanyahu\u2019s message is still overwhelmingly appreciated by the majority of active Jews worldwide. Orthodox and Liberal around the world embrace Israel in their own, often deeply reactionary way \u2013 as do plenty of evangelical Christians. Even some self-described progressive Jews, like the US writer Peter Beinart, still identify as Zionist. They do so to stay connected to family, friends and community. Were they to oppose Israel they would become outsiders. After all, since Israel\u2019s establishment in 1948, and more so since the 1967 Six Day War, communal organisations have been deeply involved in providing the intellectual, emotional and financial backing for the Jewish state.  Who knows how many more Israeli massacres it will take to wean Jews in the diaspora off the Zionist cultural drip-feed? There\u2019s a feeling of belonging, a prestige associated with the Zionist world that makes many Jews feel complete. Losing that means cutting ties with the modern, Jewish ritual of devotion to a foreign country. It\u2019s perhaps hard for an outsider to understand this.  Nevertheless, groups such as Jewish Voice for Peace in America are giving strength to an independent view. While acknowledging the worrying signs of real antisemitism emerging around the world, they argue, as Israeli journalist Amira Hass does, that \u201cIf the security of Jews in the Middle East were of real interest ... [the west] would not continue subsidising the Israeli occupation\u201d. Even the prominent Zionist Leon Wieseltier, writing in New Republic, is signalling the surging disquiet. \u201cI have been surprised by the magnitude of the indifference in the Jewish world to the human costs of Israel\u2019s defense against the missiles and the tunnels,\u201d he argued recently. A \u201cJewish Bloc against Zionism\u201d marched in the massive protests in London against the Gaza massacre, joining unprecedented outrage from Britain\u2019s political leadership over Israeli behaviour. Jews protested in New York and across America against Israeli actions.  Diaspora Jews should acknowledge the risks that arise from conflating antisemitism with anti-Zionism, a legitimate difference with historical roots. They are increasingly feeling targeted for uncritically backing Israel, and perhaps have the most to lose if this distinction is not made. The alternatives are bleak: a split among Jewish communities along generational lines, or growing disillusionment of the Jewish population.  French Jews are moving to Israel in ever-growing numbers, but few Jews feel safer in Israel than in their own nations. What threatens the Zionist establishment is not antisemitism or migration, but boycotts. A spokesperson for Britain\u2019s Community Security Trust, a group that monitors antisemitism, recently said that the community would \u201cget through\u201d a spike in Jew hatred \u2013 \u201cbut the boycott stuff is really, really serious\u201d.

There\u2019ll be the usual things like ultrasound scans and photographs of him as a newborn. There\u2019ll also be pictures of a Thai woman, Roman\u2019s surrogate mother, at various stages of pregnancy, and copies of contracts between his parents \u2013 Peter Foster and Sam Samaras \u2013 and their surrogacy agency, Talent IVF. \u201cWe\u2019re going to tell him the truth,\u201d says Foster. He and his partner of 12 years brought Roman home to the tiny West Australian town of Tom Price in March. \u201cIt\u2019s important that he knows. We\u2019re not ashamed, we\u2019re not embarrassed, and I don\u2019t think it should be something that\u2019s frowned upon.\u201d The case of Gammy, a baby boy with Down\u2019s syndrome delivered by a Thai surrogate and left behind by his West Australian parents who returned to Australia with Gammy\u2019s twin sister, has caused intense debate about the lack of regulation around commercial surrogacy. It has also raised an ethical debate, with critics saying it amounts to exploitation of poor women by wealthy westerners. As a result of the Gammy case, Thailand this month announced plans to outlaw commercial surrogacy, with scores of Australian couples stranded in the country until they can get a court order to leave with their surrogate babies. Foster, 34, was horrified by the Gammy case, and says his experience was positive and professional. With improving technology and shifting social attitudes, he sees no reason why commercial surrogacy should not be legal if it is properly regulated. If it is banned in Australia, it is inevitable that couples desperate to have a child will try overseas, he says. \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with commercial surrogacy providing there\u2019s checks and balances in place and providing no one is taken advantage of.\u201d In Western Australia, commercial surrogacy is illegal, but it is not an offence to travel overseas to organise a surrogate pregnancy. Foster and Samaras decided on Thailand after India banned surrogacy for same-sex couples last year. On its website, Talent IVF advertises it service for US$45,000 to cover the cost of doctors, the IVF procedure, tests and payment for the surrogate woman. Samaras, 41, works for Rio Tinto, and travelled to Bangkok last year to donate sperm. The couple were kept up to date via Skype and received regular reports on the woman\u2019s progress. Foster says she is in her early 30s, and it was her second surrogate pregnancy \u2013 the first resulted in twin girls. She planned to use the money to help educate her own two children. The biological mother is a Thai woman who provided a donor egg, and Foster does not know her identity. Two embryos were implanted in the surrogate, with the couple told there was a 40% chance of twins. Foster, a public servant and a councillor with the local shire of Ashburton, says there were discussions about options if tests revealed there was something wrong with the foetus. A Down\u2019s syndrome test proved negative. \u201cEverything was fine. I don\u2019t think we really considered if something had going wrong what our decision would be. [If he was born], we would have taken him regardless.\u201d The couple were advised to be in Bangkok two weeks before the baby was due to be induced. Foster couldn\u2019t make it for family reasons, but Samaras took his own mother and was present at the birth on 11 February. Foster arrived soon after. The couple met the surrogate woman, her partner and children. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect to meet them but it was quite lovely. She was nice with us, gave us a little kiss and said thank you.\u201d Legally, all went well. The surrogate mother is legally the mother on the birth certificate, and she went with Foster and Samaras, first to the Thai embassy and then the Australian embassy. A blood sample was taken from Roman\u2019s toe to prove through DNA tests that Samaras was the biological father, and that the Thai surrogate was not related to the baby. Five weeks after he was born, Roman was free to come home \u2013 a dual Thai and Australian citizen. Foster says there were \u201ca few raised eyebrows\u201d in Tom Price, population 5,000, but most people were supportive. \u201cWe feel we have to prove something. We\u2019re first-time parents, we want to do it right. It\u2019s new, it\u2019s amazing. It would be awful to take that opportunity to have a child away from people.\u201d Foster and Samaras remain members of online forums discussing surrogacy. There is angst about baby Gammy and the changes to Thailand\u2019s law, and already there is sharing of information about the next country where couples, both same-sex and heterosexual, could travel for commercial surrogacy.

Police raided a home in Bangkok earlier this month, finding nine babies with nine nannies. Mitsutoki Shigeta, 24, has been identified as the father of each of them, as well as seven more. Authorities are looking into his motives, which he says are benign. The children were apparently housed in unfurnished rooms filled with baby bottles, bouncy chairs, playpens and nappies, according to Thai police. &quot;What I can tell you so far is that I&apos;ve never seen a case like this,&quot; Thailand&apos;s Interpol director, police Maj Gen Apichart Suribunya, said on Friday. According to the Associated Press (AP), he added: &quot;We are trying to understand what kind of person makes this many babies.&quot; The investigation will centre on Japan, Cambodia, Hong Kong and India. &quot;We are looking into two motives. One is human trafficking and the other is exploitation of children,&quot; said police Lit Gen Kokiat Wongvorachart, Thailand&apos;s lead investigator in the case. He said Shigeta had made 41 trips to Thailand since 2010. On many occasions he travelled to nearby Cambodia, where he brought four of his babies. The founder of the New Life clinic, a multinational fertility clinic that provided Shigeta with two surrogate mothers, said she warned Interpol about him even before the first baby was born in June 2013, the agency reported. &quot;As soon as they got pregnant, he requested more. He said he wanted 10 to 15 babies a year, and that he wanted to continue the baby-making process until he&apos;s dead,&quot; said Mariam Kukunashvili. She told the AP, Shigeta also asked about equipment to freeze his sperm to have sufficient supply when he was older. And she said he told the clinic&apos;s manager that &quot;he wanted to win elections and could use his big family for voting&quot;, and that &quot;the best thing I can do for the world is to leave many children&quot;. Kukunashvili, who is based at the company&apos;s headquarters in the country of Georgia, said she never met Shigeta but received reports from her Thai staff. The clinic is based in Thailand and six other countries. She said she also emailed Shigeta, whose then lawyer responded to say he was involved in &quot;no dishonesty, no illegal activities&quot;. He has not been charged with any crime and, according to reports, is trying to get his children back. The 12 in Thailand are being cared for by social services and he has proven through DNA samples sent from Japan that he is their biological father. He quickly left Thailand after the raid on his condominium on 5 August and has said through a lawyer that he simply wanted a large family and has the means to support it, AP reported. Thai police said Shigeta hired 11 Thai surrogate mothers to carry his children, including four sets of twins. Police have not determined the biological mothers, Kokiat said. The case came to light after a tip-off that followed allegations that an Australian couple abandoned a surrogate baby after learning it had Down&apos;s syndrome. The couple deny the accusation. During the raid on the property, Shigeta&apos;s former lawyer Ratpratan Tulatorn insisted his client had done nothing wrong. &quot;These are legal babies, they all have birth certificates,&quot; Ratpratan told Thailand&apos;s Channel 3 television station. &quot;There are assets purchased under these babies&apos; names.

It seems too smugly self-absorbed to meet the James Foley case. Who cares if such vile horror frightens the horses in polite society? There&apos;s a bigger problem here. This is the age of the world wide web, a time of instant images and instant shock. James Foley died, horribly, on one small patch of our interconnected globe. Yet the obvious need for more concern, more understanding, which he sought in his own small, brave way to meet, has never been so feebly addressed. Only ghoulish revulsion gave his death the resonance to drag David Cameron back from holiday and prompt Barack Obama to rediscover his eloquence playbook. Foley was 40, a teacher in deprived communities who turned full-time freelance reporter a mere six years ago. He didn&apos;t stop in the US and look for a conventional newspaper job. He set off alone where the danger was greatest: to Afghanistan, Libya, Syria. He always put himself in harm&apos;s way by choice. And that, in turn, is why he mostly worked for GlobalPost, a good online deed in a bad, contracting media world that could no longer cover faraway places because that was expensive \u2013 and the audience wasn&apos;t there anyway. Here&apos;s Hannah Storm of the International News Safety Institute, lamenting Foley&apos;s end like that of the 80 or so other journalists and media workers already killed in 2014 action. &quot;He is not the first freelance journalist to be killed this year, and he will probably not be the last\u2026 With a dearth of jobs in newsrooms, and overseas bureaux being cut by major news organisations, many freelances have turned to conflicts to cut their teeth&quot;. In short, some of the most perilous places on Earth are chronicled today \u2013 if at all \u2013 by courageous or heedless young men and women, some trained, some neophytes, without the backup that Big Media can provide. &quot;Stripped down, pared-back journalism has created opportunities for those who dare, but it has also allowed outlets to hide behind flaky bottom lines as a means of abdicating responsibility&quot;, says Martin Chulov in the Guardian. And remember what one freelance, Anjan Sundaram, wrote in the Observer and New York Times last week. &quot;The western news media\u2026 are turning their backs on the world\u2026 Where correspondents were once assigned to a place for months or years, reporters now often handle 20 countries. Bureaux are in hub cities, far from many of the countries they cover\u2026 As the news has receded, so have our minds\u2026 Huge swaths of the world are forgotten or shrouded in myth.&quot; GlobalPost is a brave startup from Massachusetts, struggling for a funding formula six years after it started. The idea is to put a dozen or so full-time correspondents in spots that America doesn&apos;t cover very well \u2013 Bangkok, Lima, Nairobi, Seoul, Brussels and more \u2013 and back that coverage via 50 wide-scattered freelance stringers. Foley was one such. His Post line editor reputedly told him not to go to Syria after a frightening kidnap ordeal in Libya. He went nonetheless. That&apos;s the wonder of the freelance life. You do what you feel you need to do, not what the office tells you. It is also the peril of a stringing existence. The tiny Post formed an alliance with the mighty NBC News last year, providing some of the coverage to swell NBC&apos;s offering. Ken Doctor, one of America&apos;s shrewdest media analysts, wrote about that narrow-eyed. &quot;What NBC News needs is more high quality international news content, at a low cost. Staff-produced content is expensive, and NBC, like its network peers, has seen significant cutback in staffing for years\u2026 The GlobalPost deal is an extension of a commitment [NBC&apos;s head of newsgathering] made long ago: produce more content than ever before to feed the multi-platform beast \u2013 at a lower budget than ever before.&quot; Let&apos;s be clear. Staff journalists \u2013 such as Daniel Pearl of the Wall Street Journal \u2013 can be kidnapped and killed, too. Marie Colvin, a hero for the Sunday Times, stands high on the Syrian death list. Nevertheless, and even so, there is added risk when you&apos;re obliged to fly virtually solo \u2013 and one additional reason (money) when that&apos;s so. But then there&apos;s the dreadful link to Foley and Twitter and White House eulogies to &quot;Jim&quot;, this &quot;journalist who was a son, a brother, a friend&quot;. The money we spend on covering international news has plummeted in the quarter-century since the cold war ended. We, the reader, the viewer, have lost our fear of nuclear oblivion. We&apos;ve turned the page. The world is a much bigger, more distant place: but also far smaller, more immediate. Twitter can bring terror to our smartphones in seconds. A few hundred deluded Brits in masks can hold presidents and prime ministers in thrall. Perversely, GlobalPost will gain traction from this tragedy \u2013 and Foley, in death, will be professionally honoured as he never was in life. Isn&apos;t it time for the giants of news gathering to see what they&apos;ve let slide? Which therefore poses the greatest dilemma of all: not just the question of funding news in a digital age that wrecks revenue streams, but a chilling question for editors \u2013 and most of all for you, the audience. Do you want to know what&apos;s happening in this world, the world you live in? Do you want to see how bestial forces arise? Do you want to click off Twitter, shiver and blame the messenger?

Dressed in a while military uniform and flanked by officers, Prayuth said: &quot;I consider this the highest honour of my life,&quot; and added: &quot;I am ready to get tired.&quot; The royal endorsement will allow Prayuth \u2013 who is due to stand down as army chief next month \u2013 to establish an interim government until elections are held some time in late 2015. He is expected to form a new cabinet by October and described his priorities as preparing the country for national reform and establishing prosperity, according to media reports. &quot;Our country has accumulated many problems \u2026 which need to be urgently solved,&quot; he said. &quot;To do this we must not create future problems.&quot; Prayuth, 60, is the first coup leader to serve as prime minister in nearly 60 years and his appointment was condemned by opponents. The ruling junta, named the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), has also come under fire both at home and abroad for cracking down on dissidents; detaining politicians, journalists, critics and activists; shutting down newspapers, radio and TV stations; imposing martial law; and handpicking a military-dominated parliament that now has more officers in it than Burma&apos;s.

In the past 12 months they have spent \u00a3195.3m on Marouane Fellaini, Juan Mata, Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera, Marcos Rojo and \u00c1ngel di Mar\u00eda. Their transfer record, which had stood since Dimitar Berbatov joined from Tottenham Hotspur on a crazy deadline day back in 2008, has been smashed twice in eight months. United are no strangers to extravagance. Sir Matt Busby made Denis Law the most expensive player in the history of British football in 1962; Ron Atkinson broke the transfer record to sign Bryan Robson in 1981; and Alex Ferguson edged that figure ever higher during his 26 years with the club. Now Louis van Gaal has made Di Mar\u00eda the most expensive player to grace the English game. How will he fare? Here is the formbook for record breaking transfers in the past 20 years.  1) Fernando Torres, \u00a350m, Liverpool to Chelsea, 2011     The increasingly surly Fernando Torres. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA    What was the view at the time?Some Liverpool fans found their way on to Sky Sports News and burned replica shirts to show how angry they were about the supposed betrayal from Torres but most supporters were left wondering if this could be an opportunity for the club. Mark Lawrenson summed up their mixed emotions well in an interview with the BBC. \u201cIt\u2019s not really possible for Liverpool to replace him but they might with two players and I think that\u2019s absolutely fine,\u201d said Lawrenson. \u201cOn his day \u2013 and we have seen unbelievable days from him \u2013 he has been brilliant, as good as anyone in the world. But we haven\u2019t seen him like that for a long time. We\u2019ve seen flashes this season, but not too many. It\u2019s a bit like when King Kenny left. When he went I think we probably replaced him with about 10 as he was that good.\u201d How did he fare?As it happens, Liverpool did replace Torres with two players. On the day he left for Chelsea, the club signed Luis Su\u00e1rez for \u00a322.8m and Andy Carroll for \u00a335m. Despite wasting \u00a335m on Carroll, Liverpool did better from the deal than Torres, whose form has continued down the mournful road Lawrenson had foreseen at the time. Torres is still paid around \u00a3160,000 a week by Chelsea (how crazy is that?) but he did not even make it on to the bench for their match against Leicester on Saturday. It\u2019s embarrassing and even a little sad to write this, but he is now more famous for his misses \u2013 examples A, B and C \u2013 than his goals. Type the word \u201cTorres\u201d into YouTube and the search engine will try to finish your sentence with the words \u201cmisses open goal\u201d. No wonder the man is short of confidence. What did he win?The FA Cup, the Champions League and the Europa League.  Was the move a success or failure?Failure 2) Robinho, \u00a332.5m, Real Madrid to Manchester City, 2008     Robinho, who thought he was going to Chelsea but ended up at Manchester City. Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images    What was the view at the time?Robinho wanted to join Chelsea in the summer of 2008 but the Manchester City owners had other ideas. When the \u00a332.5m deal was finalised, Robinho told journalists he was off \u201cto Chelsea\u201d. The reporters corrected his mistake and he managed to express a modicum of excitement for the \u201cproject\u201d but, even on his first day, he never seemed truly animated about the his new job. \u201cMany people think that Manchester City are not a big club at the moment, but I think the opposite,\u201d said Robinho, somewhat unconvincingly.  \u201cThe team don\u2019t yet have many titles, but they are beginning a project now. Four years ago, Chelsea were seen in the same way. Of course, my goal had been to go to Chelsea because they were the only club that had made a proposal to me. But there was a fight between Real Madrid and Chelsea. Chelsea made the mistake of putting my name on their shirt without having signed anything yet. This hurt the pride of Real Madrid. Also, Chelsea didn\u2019t reach the asking price.\u201d  How did he fare?Robinho served a purpose for City. He was a trailblazer who brought City to the attention of big players and their agents. He scored on his debut, knocked in a hat-trick against Stoke City a few weeks later and was even given the captaincy, but the love affair was fleeting.  His interest drifted and his enthusiasm wilted. Craig Bellamy wrote in his autobiography that Robinho and his fellow countryman Elano \u201cformed a Brazilian clique and didn\u2019t give a shit. They didn\u2019t train with any intensity and if you tackled one of them, it was like you had committed a crime.\u201d Robinho would probably disagree with that assessment, but when he swapped City for a loan spell at Santos he admitted that his Brazilian style was incompatible with English football.  He left the club after 18 months, having played 41 games and scored 14 goals. By then City had moved on, with Carlos T\u00e9vez and Emmanuel Adebayor now scoring their goals and causing their problems. What did he win?Nothing Was the move a success or a failure?Failure 3) Andriy Shevchenko, \u00a330.8m, AC Milan to Chelsea, 2006     Andriy Shevchenko and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho not seeing eye to eye. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian    What was the view at the time?Andriy Shevchenko won the Ballon d\u2019Or in 2004, two years before Roman Abramovich brought him to Chelsea. Shevchenko had been a frighteningly quick striker at Dynamo Kyiv, for whom he once scored a first-half hat-trick against Barcelona, and then he had improved at Milan, where he scored 127 goals in 208 appearances on his way to winning the Serie A title, the Champions League and the Coppa Italia. He should have been a success at Chelsea, but ...  How did he fare?Shevchenko is Milan\u2019s second highest goalscorer in their history, but he only scored nine league goals in three seasons at Chelsea. He is almost apologetic about it: \u201cI left Milan when I was nearly 30 years old, and I had won everything. When I arrived at Chelsea, everyone expected me to repeat the same performances but that was impossible. I suffered many injuries and many other things. Chelsea rarely wanted to play with two strikers. Like it or not, criticism from people is part of our job, our world. Without all these endless discussions, football would not be football.\u201d What did he win?The FA Cup and the League Cup Was the move a success or failure?Failure 4) Rio Ferdinand, \u00a329.1m, Leeds to Manchester United, 2002     Alex Ferguson keeps his hand firmly in his pocket as Rio Ferdinand signs for Manchester United in an awful suit. Photograph: Darren Walsh/Action Images    What was the view at the time?Spending \u00a329.1m on a defender would be a big deal in 2014. Twelve years ago, the transfer fee was huge. Leeds were in need of some money, with debts of around \u00a378m, and even their manager, Terry Venables, admitted the the offer was \u201cperhaps impossible to turn down\u201d.  Venables did not want to lose his captain but Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale could not refuse the cash: \u201cWhen your captain says he wants to leave you have to listen. We\u2019ve got the best price available I\u2019m satisfied I\u2019ve done the best job for Leeds United. If you invest \u00a318m and get \u00a330m you\u2019ve done a good job \u2013 especially if the player says he doesn\u2019t want to play for you again. He\u2019s a great player and a nice lad and I\u2019m sad he\u2019s leaving, but he\u2019ll go with our best wishes and we\u2019ll spend the money wisely.\u201d  How did he fare?Harry Redknapp, the West Ham manager who had sold Ferdinand to Leeds, had an interesting take on his transfer to Manchester United: \u201cWhen Leeds came in with their offer, we couldn\u2019t turn it down. Money like that enabled a club like West Ham to rebuild with a couple of players. Now Manchester United have done the same to Leeds. That\u2019s the name of the game, I\u2019m afraid. There\u2019s always a bigger fish out there somewhere waiting to pounce. I always knew he would go to the top and he has. He\u2019s at the top now with Manchester United. He\u2019s without doubt the best defender in Europe, if not the world.\u201d Redknapp was not far wrong. Aside from the odd lapse in concentration in his early years and the eight-month ban for missing a drugs test, Ferdinand proved to be one of the best defenders in world football. His elegance combined perfectly with Nemanja Vidic\u2019s relentless desire to win the ball and the pair led the club to three European Cup finals in four seasons.  What did he win?Six Premier League titles, two League Cups, the Champions League and the Fifa Club World Cup. Was the move a success or failure?Success 5) Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n, \u00a328m, Lazio to Manchester United, 2001     Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n and Alex Ferguson wear Manchester United scarves at his unveiling. Photograph: Gary M Prior/Getty Images    What was the view at the time?Contrary to popular belief, Paul Scholes did speak before he began working for every organ of the media in his retirement. Back in September 2001, when Ver\u00f3n had been at United for a few months, Scholes was asked to compare his new team-mate with Eric Cantona. \u201cIn terms of his all-round game, I think he\u2019ll do more than Eric has done,\u201d said Scholes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he will have more of an influence on the team but he\u2019s just a better player. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think Eric was amazing but I think Juan has just a bit more. He\u2019s involved in the game all the time. He can create and score goals. He can just do anything.\u201d How did he fare?Not as well as Paul Scholes had predicted. Ver\u00f3n was the old Dimitar Berbatov. A decade before Manchester United fans debated the merits of Berbatov, they had the same arguments about Veron \u2013 is he lazy or in possession of an insouciant cool? Does he slow the team down or add tactical control? Is he what the team need in Europe or their weakness in the league? In the end, he went the same was as Berbatov. Alex Ferguson lost patience with him and sent him off to west London at a reduced price.  What did he win?The Premier League Was the move a success or failure?Failure 6) Alan Shearer, \u00a315m, Blackburn Rovers to Newcastle United, 1996     Alan Shearer practices his goal celebration as he is introduced to the Newcastle United fans. Photograph: Paul Barker/PA    What was the view at the time?Newcastle paid Blackburn \u00a31.7m more for Alan Shearer than Barcelona had just paid to take Ronaldo from PSV Eindhoven to the Nou Camp. They made Shearer the most expensive footballer in the history of the game. And the locals loved it. The club ran out of letters as their fans lined up to have the No9 emblazoned on the back of their shirts. Kevin Keegan addressed the media from Bangkok, where Newcastle were playing the Thailand national team as part of their summer tour, and he was full of beans. \u201cThis signing is for the people of Newcastle,\u201d declared Keegan. \u201cIt just shows you the ambition of Newcastle United. We are the biggest thinking team in Europe now. We\u2019re not the biggest, most successful team, but we\u2019re the biggest thinking club and we have tremendous support from above which allows me to buy players.\u201d  How did he fare?Shearer scored 25 league goals in his first season with Newcastle and remained prolific until his retirement in 2006. He is still the top scorer in the Premier League, with his remarkable total of 260 goals considerably higher than that of any other player. Andrew Cole is second in that all-time list, a full 73 goals behind Shearer. Only nine players have scored half as many Premier League goals as Shearer managed.  What did he win?Nothing Was the move a success or failure?Success 7) Stan Collymore, \u00a38.5m, Nottingham Forest to Liverpool, 1995     Stan Collymore scores Liverpool\u2019s winning goal in their 4-3 win over Newcastle United at Anfield in 1996. Photograph: David Kendall/PA    What was the view at the time?As Liverpool and Everton battled it out to sign Stan Collymore, newspaper columnists fretted about the gross wages football clubs were willing to pay players. Collymore was to earn \u00a313,000 a week and the punditocracy wondered where it would end. The more things change, the more they stay the same.  Collymore said he chose Liverpool over Everton for footballing and not financial reasons, telling Joe Royle that he had friends at the club. \u201cAs I understand it, it just comes down to the fact that he knows some of the other players over at Anfield,\u201d said the Everton manager. \u201cIt was a personal thing. There is no ill feeling and I wish him well.\u201d  Roy Evans thought his masterplan was coming together \u2013 \u201cStan is another piece in my jigsaw but at these prices I can\u2019t afford too many more pieces\u201d \u2013 and Collymore did his best not to think about the money. \u201cLiverpool bought me to play football on the pitch, not to run around saying \u2018I\u2019m an \u00a38.5m footballer\u2019,\u201d he said, while petitioning Nottingham Forest to cough up the 5% of the transfer fee he thought was owed. How did he fare?Things are always complicated with Collymore. He scored 28 goals in 64 appearances for Liverpool, which is a respectable figure for any striker but, despite having all those friends at Liverpool, he didn\u2019t settle well at the club. He missed training sessions. He sulked. And he had \u201creasonably loud sex\u201d with the boss\u2019s daughter.  Neil Ruddock says Collymore could have been a world-beater, but in the end Liverpool were happy to let him go to Aston Villa after two season: \u201cStan didn\u2019t make any attempt to get on with the lads and, although I used to sit next to him on the coach and try and make conversation with him, I could never claim to know him,\u201d wrote Ruddock in his autobiography. \u201cNobody did. He\u2019d turn up for training, do his work, get changed and go home. Not exactly conducive to good team spirit, so I think most of the lads were relieved when he was finally flogged off to Aston Villa.\u201d  What did he win?Nothing Was the move a success or failure?Failure 8) Dennis Bergkamp, \u00a37.5m, Internazionale to Arsenal, 1995     Bruce Rioch poses with Dennis Bergkamp, the first player he bought as Arsenal manager. Photograph: Tony Harris/PA    What was the view at the time?Dennis Bergkamp failed at Internazionale. But he was never going to succeed. Bergkamp, this product of Dutch total football who was raised by Johan Cruyff to prize the assist over the goal, ended up in a team led by Osvaldo Bagnoli, a coach who believed that the quickest way to the goal was the most efficient: \u201cI used to say to the players: the fewer passes you make the better it is,\u201d says Bagnoli of his tactics at Internationale. \u201cI don\u2019t like tick-tock football. I used to say even to the goalkeeper: if you have the ball and see the forward is free then give him the ball.\u201d  Bergkamp was an island: a collaborator in a team that wanted to play the long ball. His strike partner, Ruben Sosa, was an individualist who attacked on his own. Bergkamp was on the outside. So he left for Bruce Rioch\u2019s Arsenal.  The relationship was perfect from the start. At his unveiling the club broadcast a little video of his best goals and assists, with This Is The One by the Stone Roses providing the soundtrack. He liked that. When he went on to the pitch for the press photographs, the head groundsman placed him on a wooden plank so he wouldn\u2019t harm the grass. He loved that. When he went back to his hotel, he saw the story BERGKAMP JOINS ARSENAL was on pages 301 and 302 of Ceefax. That blew him away. He had found a home. How did he fare?They built him a statue. What did he win?Three Premier League titles and four FA Cups. Was the move a success or failure?Success 9) Andy Cole, \u00a37m, Newcastle United to Manchester United, 1995     Alex Ferguson gives Andy Cole his first Manchester United shirt in January 1995. Photograph: David Kendall/PA    What was the view at the time?When Rob Lee noticed that Andrew Cole was missing from Newcastle\u2019s training session he thought his team-mate \u201cwas off on one of his London trips\u201d. In fact Cole was signing for Manchester United, a move that would break the British transfer record and leave a defensive Kevin Keegan arguing with angry fans on the steps of St James\u2019 Park.  Mark Hughes was on the wrong side of 30 and Manchester United needed fresh legs up front so Alex Ferguson set about finding a new striker. He called Nottingham Forest manager Frank Clark to enquire about Stan Collymore\u2019s availability, but Clark had gone home with flu. So Ferguson turned his attention to Cole, whose relationship with Keegan had soured after a debate about his intensity in traning. Collymore heard rumours that Cole was signing for United and tried to contact his agent, Paul Stretford. Unfortunately for Collymore, Stretford was also Cole\u2019s agent and by the time his calls were answered, Cole was on his way to Manchester and Stretford was on his way to the bank.  How did he fare?Cole scored 93 goals in 195 appearances for Manchester United but he will always be remembered for his partnership with Dwight Yorke. \u201cWhen we started playing together, it was like meeting a special woman and falling in love,\u201d recalled Cole in an interview with FourFourTwo. \u201cEverything felt right. We never had a cross word. Our confidence soared and we thought we\u2019d score every week. If one of us didn\u2019t score, the other would. We could alter our play depending on the opposition: I\u2019d go long, he\u2019d go short. Nobody knew how to mark us. At times, we had so much space that we took liberties.\u201d The pair scored 53 goals betwen them in United\u2019s most successful season ever, including these beauties against Barcelona in the Champions League.  What did he win?Five Premier League titles, two FA Cups and the Champions League.

He backs out of commitments. The Islamic website he wants to publish from his Italian home remains unfinished.  \u201cI would add,\u201d he said through translation, \u201cthat I cannot think of the future.\u201d  The doctors tell Britel that he has post-traumatic stress disorder, after a decade-long ordeal of imprisonment without charge or transfer and abuse. It began in 2002, when the United States packed him onto a contractor\u2019s Gulfstream V in Pakistan and flew him to Morocco.  Britel survived what the US calls rendition, an extrajudicial process of transferring a detainee for \u201cinterrogation\u201d in a foreign country. Allies of the US beat Britel with a cricket bat, shoved a bottle into his anus, denied him access to lawyers and Italian diplomats and unceremoniously released him in 2011, as if nothing ever happened.  \u201cRendition is a series of shocking events, one worse than the other,\u201d he said.  The latest shock comes from Washington, in the form of a long-delayed Senate intelligence committee report into the CIA\u2019s post-9/11 torture. Britel and nine other rendition survivors want to see their names in it, a measure they consider necessary both for accountability and for their own closure. In an open letter to Barack Obama on Thursday, coordinated by human rights group Reprieve, they urge the report\u2019s thorough and prompt declassification.  \u201cI ask that there be admission of what went on or an apology for it,\u201d said Abdul Hakim Belhadj, once the commander of the infamous Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, whose allies against Muammar Gaddafi included al-Qaida.  Belhadj, who agreed to a phone interview through translation in Tripoli, is now an Islamist politician in war-torn Libya (\u201cWe have a sort of acceptable stability in the field at the moment,\u201d he said.) In 2004, the CIA helped deliver him from a Bangkok airport into one of Gaddafi\u2019s prisons. In 2011, after more than six years in prison, he tacitly fought beside the US in the war to oust the dictator.  While most attention surrounding the report has focused on abuses the CIA implemented, less has concerned abuses others committed on America\u2019s behalf and with its complicity.  Three of the Middle East\u2019s most brutal and hated dictators participated fulsomely in pre- and post-9/11 renditions: Gaddafi, Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Though the CIA cultivated robust relationships with their security services, cemented around counter-terrorism, the US would later abandon Mubarak, aid in Gaddafi\u2019s overthrow and killing, and come within a hair\u2019s breadth last year of attacking Assad.  Through those alliances, the US secretly permitted the architecture of rendition to encompass their partners\u2019 enemies. Documents recovered by Human Rights Watch in the aftermath of Gaddafi\u2019s overthrow showed the US capturing and interrogating Gaddafi\u2019s opponents in the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, whose ties to al-Qaida were nuanced and transactional, and then rendering them to Gaddafi.  \u201cInterrogation\u201d entailed, among other things, being sealed inside a small \u201cconfinement box,\u201d repeated beatings and waterboarding \u2013 all within CIA custody, and all before transference to Gaddafi\u2019s prisons for even more brutal treatment.  \u201cAt that time, there was an agreement between Gaddafi and the US and UK to return political opponents to him,\u201d Belhadj said.  Belhadj was one of them. After traveling to Afghanistan before 9/11, where he was reputed to have met Taliban leader Mullah Omar \u2013 \u201cAt no point have I ever engaged in any terrorist activity,\u201d he insisted \u2013 he settled in Malaysia and applied for political asylum in the UK. In 2004, he was snatched at the Bangkok airport, with his wife, by men he believes to have been CIA agents.  A 2004-era document recovered from Gaddafi\u2019s security services after his downfall, believed to be written by the CIA, reads: \u201cOur service is committed to rendering the terrorist Abu Abdullah al-Sadiq to your custody. To this end, we have been in touch with the Malaysian authorities to help facilitate the transfer of custody in atimely [sic] manner.\u201d Abu Abdullah al-Sadiq was Belhadj\u2019s nom de guerre. \u201cThey seized me there. That was where I was started to be beaten, as was my pregnant wife,\u201d he said. \u201cThey questioned me about knowledge of any terrorist activities, knowledge of bin Laden, things like that.\u201d Britel said he faced the same sort of questions.  It would be the start of more than six years Belhadj would spend inside Libyan prisons, including the infamous Abou Salim jail. Five of those years, he said, were spent in isolation, without even yard privileges. \u201cConditions were extremely difficult,\u201d he said. Those who survived rendition and wrote Thursday\u2019s open letter believe disclosure of the report is a \u201cnecessary part of correcting America\u2019s own history,\u201d a step toward preventing the next US lapse into an embrace of torture.  \u201cToday in America, the architects of the torture program declare on television they did the right thing. High-profile politicians tell assembled Americans that \u2018waterboarding\u2019 is a \u2018baptism\u2019 that American forces should still engage in,\u201d they write.  But disclosure is taking a circuitous path before completion.  On Wednesday, the Justice Department asked a judge in a freedom of information case to delay until late September ordering the release of documents peripheral to the torture report, including the CIA\u2019s rebuttal. The request was largely predicated on a letter Senator Dianne Feinstein, the architect of the report, wrote to the attorney general expecting \u201ca mutually agreeable version of those documents for public release\u201d by 29 September.  While Feinstein and the CIA have reached the nadir of their relationship \u2013 the CIA intends to attack her report\u2019s credibility \u2013 there are concerns that the CIA has weighed the scale in favor of secrecy. Obama allowed it to lead the declassification review, despite its interest in keeping the report secret. McClatchy reported this week that the main declassification interlocutor with Feinstein, top intelligence lawyer Robert Litt, represented CIA clients in private practice in undisclosed lawsuits.  \u201cWe believe the public should know the full story of what took place in the CIA\u2019s secret prisons and that all of these documents \u2013 the Senate report, the CIA response and the Panetta review should be released to the public,\u201d said Jameel Jaffer, the deputy legal director of the ACLU, which filed the freedom-of-information case. (The Panetta review is a document compiled for former CIA director Leon Panetta apparently detailing and analyzing CIA information provided to Feinstein\u2019s committee.)  \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that the government is seeking further delay, but, given Senator Feinstein\u2019s assurances, we\u2019re hopeful that all of the documents will be released with very limited redactions in September.\u201d  Neither Feinstein\u2019s committee nor the Obama administration ever intended to release the report in full. In April, the Senate panel voted to release only its findings, executive summary and recommendations. It has negotiated censoring the public report within those self-imposed limitations, and reportedly agreed to remove names and specific identifiers for both torture perpetrators and victims.  The 10 rendition survivors object.  \u201cWe, some of the torture program\u2019s targets, have real stories, and families, and lives. Americans deserve to know who we are,\u201d they wrote to Obama on Thursday.  \u201cYou ended the torture program; in time, your decision to name us will prove equally important. Our families and our countries are waiting to hear from you.\u201d Like many observers anticipating the release of the Senate torture report, Britel is ambivalent, unsure how much of its contents will be withheld. \u201cThe release could force the countries involved in my rendition to acknowledge their responsibility, or it may be useless. We\u2019ll see,\u201d Britel said.

With his dark hair swept to the side and bee-stung lips, Cambodian painter Chov Theanly is often told he\u2019s the dapper doppelganger of the country\u2019s most well-known crooner, the late Sinn Sisamouth, the Frank Sinatra of Cambodia during the 60s, the country\u2019s golden age. When Khmer Rouge soldiers marched through Cambodia\u2019s cities in 1975, sending its people to oppressive labour camps, film stars and musicians were some of the brutal regime\u2019s first targets and, like many of his peers, Sisamouth disappeared. But today, almost 40 years later, the arts are thriving once again, and no more so than in Battambang, a dreamy, peaceful city between the capital Phnom Penh and tourist mecca Siem Reap. While construction has rocketed along at breakneck speeds elsewhere, Battambang has, despite being the country\u2019s second-largest city, remained relatively untainted by tourism and mass development. The Sankae river snakes through town, while rice fields, leafy villages and glittering pagodas halo around its edges. I meet 28-year-old Theanly at a small, artist-run space called Sammaki in the middle of town for an informal art tour. A graphic designer and painter who works from a cool, airy attic above his father\u2019s Chinese shophouse on the riverbank, Theanly is one of a wave of home-grown artists enjoying recent success \u2013 his exhibition, entitled Surviving, sold out on its opening night in Phnom Penh last year. \u201cEverything is just very open and creative and collaborative in Battambang,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThere\u2019s an honesty here.\u201d         Perhaps at the core of the city\u2019s artistic revival is the visual arts centre Phare Ponleu Selpak. The sprawling arts school teaches visual, applied and performing arts, provides a formal state education curriculum for almost 1,000 students and welcomes tourists through its gates almost every day of the year, with a circus troupe performance twice a week in the bright big top tent. Phare\u2019s visual arts graduates are now opening their own contemporary art galleries, studios and workshops, and we visit artist-curator Mao Soviet who runs Make Maek, and the newly opened artist-collective space called Studio Art Battambang. It\u2019s a cavernous old shophouse that exhibits large, bamboo sculptures and huge canvases. We pop next door to refuel at Kinyei, a social enterprise cafe with probably the best coffee in Cambodia (try a piccolo or a \u201cCambodian street latte\u201d with palm sugar and orange essence). On Theanly\u2019s suggestion I head to another social enterprise eatery for dinner, the innovative Jaan Bai, on Street 2. With Bangkok-based celebrity chef David Thompson involved in the set-up and menu design, it\u2019s a fun spot to unwind \u2013 local artists were commissioned to create a huge, psychedelic mural on the restaurant\u2019s outside wall and the menu is designed for sharing. Head chef Mohm trained intensively with Thompson at the Bangkok Nahm and the menu reflects this \u2013 there\u2019s a delicious Thai green curry, a finger-licking good dish of crab from the seaside hamlet Kep with Kampot pepper with chilli jam and a fiery kick. Cocktails have a Khmer twist \u2013 try the dragonfruit caipirinha and the lemongrass bloody mary.     The terrace at Jaan Bai restaurant    Besides the contemporary art scene, Battambang\u2019s striking architecture adds to its allure. To the north of town lies the magnificent Sala Khaet, the old Governor\u2019s Residence. In 1905 the last Thai \u201clord governor\u201d, Chhum Aphaiwong, hired Italian architects to erect this sweeping European-style palace. Elsewhere, French colonial villas and art deco structures rub shoulders with striking modernist \u201cNew Khmer\u201d buildings erected during the 1960s. The influence of China is evident too \u2013 one good example is at Lotus, a sleek restaurant-cum-gallery in a three-storey Chinese shophouse, painstakingly restored by Battambang expat Darren Swallow. While the restaurant serves middle-eastern fare \u2013 house-made hummus, baba ganoush, Iraqi-style laffe flatbread, couscous and lentil salads \u2013 the second floor hosts art exhibits and screens independent films and documentaries. I venture out of town on my last day and join a half-day cycling tour with Soksabike, another community project set up by Kinyei cafe. It\u2019s a 30km loop around the villages and gives us a glimpse into the various agricultural industries \u2013 rice paper production, dried fruits, rice liquor and prahok (fermented fish paste) are some \u2013 that support Battambang\u2019s economy.     Cycling tour with Soksabike, a community project    Weaving along palm-fringed roads in the early morning haze is a dreamy experience. We continue down red-dirt roads, through a maze of bamboo trees and lush countryside. Women with checked kramas (cotton scarves) wrapped around their heads smile and wave at us. Later, we see women wearing hijabs in a rainbow of colours do the same. This north-western area is home to many Muslim Cham villages, and is studded with ornate mosques. This melting pot of cultures, ethnicities and religions, plus the juxtaposition of old and new, is what Theanly finds captivating about Battambang, and something he thinks makes it a great spot for creativity. \u201cMy aunt grew up in this town in the 1960s,\u201d he says. \u201cShe always tells me stories of Sinn Sisamouth coming up here to visit other stars: how they would stroll along the river and he would play the harmonica. One of his famous songs, Oh Battambang, is about this river, and I think most people who come here see what he saw \u2026 they see what\u2019s so special. I can\u2019t imagine being anywhere else right now.\u201d \u2022 Singapore Airlines flies from Heathrow to Phnom Penh via Singapore for about \u00a3680 return. Buses run regularly from Phnom Penh to Battambang (five to six hours, $7) and from Siem Reap (four to five hours, $4) but for a more comfortable and faster ride, a private taxi from Phnom Penh (four hours) and Siem Reap (three-four hours) costs about $50.

Andy Hall, 33, also faces a $10m (\u00a36m) fine if found guilty in civil and criminal lawsuits brought against him by the Thai company Natural Fruit \u2013 which supplies the EU with drinks products \u2013 after writing a report alleging major human rights and labour abuses within the company. Hall&apos;s allegations include violence against employees, forced overtime, the use of underage labour, and the confiscation of passports of its Burmese migrant workforce. Natural Fruit denies the allegations. Hall&apos;s findings were published in a report, Cheap has a high price, for the Finnish NGO Finnwatch last year. Natural Fruit, which produces pineapple products and is part of a larger conglomerate that also makes dried fruit and aloe vera products, was supplying juice concentrate to several Finnish retailers at the time. Hall has described the charges against him as &quot;judicial harassment&quot;, adding: &quot;Migrant exploitation by employers, officials and brokers is widespread and systematic \u2026 This abuse extends to many export markets beyond fishing, seafood and pineapples to poultry, fruit and veg, rubber and \u2013 even more now \u2013 retail, food and beverage, and tourism.&quot; His case has sparked alarm among activists, NGOs, human rights groups and food companies worldwide. Hundreds of thousands of people have signed petitions calling for Natural Fruit to drop the case against Hall, while last week United Nordic, a group of food wholesalers from northern Europe, warned that the case could seriously damage the Thai food industry. Last month, an international workers&apos; union described Hall&apos;s defamation case as a &quot;national and international embarrassment&quot;, adding that it was the Thai government, not Hall, who would be shown to be on trial when proceedings began in September. Activists, including Hall, have alleged that the case has direct links to the Thai government. Natural Fruit&apos;s owner is also the president of the Thai Pineapple Industry Association, which supplies the multinational company Dole, and is said to be the brother a high-ranking Thai politician. The Thai government has defended Natural Fruit, saying the firm had a right to sue Hall and that he was allowed to defend himself under Thai law. In a statement, the Thai embassy in London said it had full confidence in Thailand&apos;s judicial system. By agreeing to prosecute, &quot;the Thai government is complicit in an effort to cover up abuses of migrant workers and shut down external investigations of supply chains of Thai exporters&quot;, Human Rights Watch&apos;s deputy Asia director, Phil Robertson, told the Guardian. Thailand has been ruled by a military junta since May, when General Prayuth Chan-ocha took control of the country in a bloodless coup, and soon after threatened to arrest and deport illegal labourers, who comprise up to 10% of Thailand&apos;s workforce. Hall, whose British passport was confiscated by Thai authorities, will attend the Thai-language court proceedings along with observers from the Finnish and British embassies. In an emailed statement to the Guardian, the UK embassy in Bangkok said it was providing Hall with consular assistance. &quot;We are also working with other diplomatic missions and international organisations in Thailand to ensure that the Thai authorities are fully aware of the extent of international concern regarding this case, which we expect to proceed in accordance with Thai law and international human rights standards.&quot; It added: &quot;The UK supports the right of activists to carry out their work and voice their opinion in order to promote human rights, including labour rights, peacefully \u2026 We continue to raise the issue of labour rights in general with the Thai authorities.

It is a case that human rights groups claim is a \u201ccomplicit cover-up\u201d by the government, an attempt to shoot the messenger rather than improve working conditions, and NGOs, industry experts and hundreds of thousands of people all over the world have signed petitions calling for Natural Fruit to drop its charges against him. But Hall, whose civil and criminal trial began in Bangkok at the beginning of September, has no choice but to face the courts. His passport has been confiscated and additional charges against him levelled just one day after proceedings started. \u201cThey are basically making my life impossible,\u201d says Hall, 34, in what he claims is an effort to silence him. \u201cI have to focus my whole life on defending myself.\u201d Born in Lincolnshire to working-class parents, Hall was the first child in the family to go to university. After graduating with a first-class honours degree in law from University College London, he worked briefly with criminal offenders in Oxford before taking a PhD in corporate social responsibility in Melbourne and Cardiff, focusing on occupational deaths. It was a backpacking trip through northern Thailand in 2004 that sparked his interest in migrants\u2019 rights. Meeting Burmese construction workers who had been disabled on the job and left without any medical or financial support, Hall says he felt a strong desire to \u201cboth empower migrants to stand up and fight the abuse they were facing\u201d but also \u201cto create a system and policies within the Thai system to allow them to stand up and fight\u201d. Even now, he adds, migrant workers \u2013 who comprise as much as 10% of Thailand\u2019s workforce, primarily in the fishing, construction, canning and agriculture sectors \u2013 are not allowed to form unions in Thailand, and their rights are still severely limited. In the 10 years he has worked in Thailand and neighbouring Burma, Hall \u2013 who speaks both Thai and Burmese \u2013 has made impressive gains steering migrant workers\u2019 groups in the two nations; advising Burma\u2019s intelligence services on migration issues and policies; helping to develop passport systems so that migrant workers can be regularised; and organising personal friend Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s hugely publicised visit to Thailand in 2012 to meet with thousands of Burmese migrant workers in the fishing and canning industries. But his high-profile work has not often been met with open arms, particularly in Thailand, where he claims the government has never been willing to tackle trafficking or migration \u2013 two serious issues in a nation where up to half a million people are thought to live in slavery. Then there are the worrying phonecalls. Hall says one caller \u2013 who claimed to be a relative of Natural Fruit\u2019s owner, Nai Wirat \u2013 recently phoned to verbally attack him. And there have been warnings of worse: a Thai deputy minister personally told him that he was putting his life in danger. Still, Hall is defiant and unapologetic in the face of such adversity. \u201cWhat I did was in the public interest for the benefit of migrants, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing for 10 years,\u201d he tells the Guardian, during a break at court. \u201cI\u2019m not going to back down because I\u2019ve done nothing wrong. \u201cMy work is not negative, it\u2019s not bad, it\u2019s not vicious \u2013 it\u2019s intended to make things better.

At the age of 10, Phloi goes to live in the royal palace in Bangkok with her mother, who serves as a minor courtier. Phloi\u2019s eventful life inside and outside the palace \u2013 as daughter, sister, wife and mother \u2013 reflects the enormous changes taking place in the country.

It\u2019s a fresh, provocative take on the country\u2019s beauty and bleakness \u2013 without a hint of exoticism. In the poignant title story, a son and his mother, who is rapidly going blind, go on a trip to see their country as tourists. In Priscilla the Cambodian, a boy learns of the hostility towards migrants. And in the novella-length Cockfighter, a family is almost torn apart by a father\u2019s obsession with betting, bird-fighting and getting even with the town bully. The first-person narration in each of the seven stories immediately draws the reader in, whether it\u2019s about cultural discord, coming of age and the loss of innocence, small-town corruption or social divisions. The narrators, mostly young Thais, are finding their way in an unequal and irrational adult world. An acute observer, Rattawut makes a candid and witty tour guide to the darker side of the \u201cland of smiles\u201d. And despite an undercurrent of anger and frustration, he avoids pamphleteering. Rattawut was born in Chicago and grew up in Bangkok. He lives in New York. A History of Thailand by Chris Baker and Pasuk Phongpaichit This engaging and accessible history focuses on the economic, social and political forces that shaped contemporary Thailand. Baker and Pasuk reveal how ruling nobles, unfree labourers, Chinese migrants and Buddhism become part of the mix as the country is transformed from a culturally and linguistically disparate region into a homogenised nation-state under a strong monarchy. Although Thailand avoids direct colonial rule, it doesn\u2019t escape foreign machinations. French and British territorial ambitions have to be parlayed, the second world war brings Japanese occupation, and the US underwrites dictatorship and recruits Thailand as an ally during the cold war. The military and Washington also oversee a revival of the monarchy following its partial eclipse in 1932, when it was forced into a constitutional role (today Thailand has severe lese-majesty laws). The authors recount how, over the years, nationalists, army generals, communist guerrillas, businessmen and civil society movements have all attempted to capture the state and bend it to their beliefs. The right, seeking to impose its formula of nation, religion and king, comes up against reformers pushing for a more liberal, democratic state. The battle remains unresolved, as the recent military coup attests to. Baker taught Asian history at Cambridge University and has lived in Thailand for more than 20 years. Pasuk teaches at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok. \u2022 Check out the other countries in our World library series: Nigeria, Colombia, Vietnam, Egypt, Brazil, Kenya, Indonesia, Libya, Mexico, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Philippines, Iran, Peru, Somalia, China, Afghanistan, Haiti and Sudan", "publicationDate": "2014-09-11T09:38:21Z", "tags": ["Global development", "Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Books", "Culture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/booksblog/2014/sep/11/thailand-best-books-review", "title": "The best books on Thailand: start your reading here | Pushpinder Khaneka", "sentences": ["At the age of 10, Phloi goes to live in the royal palace in Bangkok with her mother, who serves as a minor courtier.", "Rattawut was born in Chicago and grew up in Bangkok.", "Pasuk teaches at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "The University of Sydney has withdrawn invitations for two Sri Lankan human rights organisations to an international conference at the request of the Sri Lankan military, angering campaigners. The university is due to host a two-day event in Bangkok from Monday along with the University of Colombo, which will see delegates from around the world discuss the enhancement of human rights in the Asia Pacific region.  Delegations from the Sri Lankan military and the Sri Lankan police are expected to attend the conference. Leaked correspondence, seen by Guardian Australia, shows that these delegations had originally requested that all non-government organisations (NGOs) from Sri Lanka be uninvited, and organisers subsequently rescinded two invitations.  The civil war in Sri Lanka, in which up to 100,000 people were killed, ended in 2009. The Rajapaksa regime stands accused of war crimes for its brutal suppression of civilians in the north of the country, with both sides subject to a UN human rights council inquiry into alleged war crimes.  Australia was one of 12 countries to abstain in a UN vote for the investigation.  Guardian Australia has also seen a letter discussing the reasons for rescinding the invitations to the two NGOs sent by the conference\u2019s director, University of Sydney associate professor Danielle Celermajer.  \u201cWith about 130 people from across the region confirmed from the conference, it would be a disaster for all members of the Sri Lankan forces, who have been at the heart of the project, to withdraw,\u201d it states.  \u201cIn fact, should they do so, the conference would be unviable. Moreover, we believe that to insist that the NGOs come would place the CSHR [The Centre for the Study of Human Rights at the University of Colombo] and potentially those NGOs at risk of being punished for this decision.\u201d Guardian Australia has seen a copy of the running order of the conference. Sri Lankan military officials are due to speak at a number of events, with one titled: \u201cFacing the challenge of human rights protection in the security sector in the Asia Pacific\u201d.  Australian newsgroup Fairfax has reported further correspondence from Celermajer, telling conference delegates to avoid any confrontation with Sri Lankan military officials at the conference.  The UK-based Sri Lanka Campaign for Peace and Justice has published an open letter to all other conference guests urging them not to participate in the event.  \u201cBy allowing the Sri Lankan Army to dictate who can or cannot attend, the organisers of this conference are, in effect, acceding to that wish, thereby potentially making themselves complicit in the Sri Lankan government\u2019s systematic attempts to suppress dissent and intimidate critical voices within civil society, and to legitimise that policy internationally,\u201d the letter reads.  \u201cWe consider this wholly unacceptable, and believe that the conference, in its current form, will do damage to human rights in Sri Lanka \u2013 damage that will outweigh any good it might achieve,\u201d it adds.  Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said rescinding invitations to the two NGOs was \u201cvery disturbing\u201d.  \u201cBy caving to pressure from security forces this is sending the signal that the voices of security forces are more important than the voices of civil society. It also sends the message that universities can be strong-armed by the Sri Lankan government to drive the agenda and participation of an academic conference, which is very disturbing,\u201d Adams said.  \u201cDefending human rights is about protecting victims, not giving in to intimidating tactics,\u201d he added.  The University of Sydney said it continued to back conference organisers.  \u201cAssociate professor Celermajer\u2019s ongoing project involves taking new and considered approaches in its attempt to improve what are often intractable situations in the region,\u201d a spokeswoman said.  \u201cThese issues are inevitably complex, but intellectual and political breakthroughs require ground-breaking research. The University of Sydney supports academic freedom for all of its staff and encourages them to freely express their views.\u201d Guardian Australia understands Amnesty International have pulled their delegation out of the conference as a result of the university\u2019s actions.

She sidestepped into music in the late 90s, co-founding the LA indie four-piece Rilo Kiley. She has gone on to perform with her boyfriend, fellow musician Johnathan Rice, as one half of the duo Jenny and Johnny, and released three solo albums. Her latest, The Voyager, is out now on Warner Music. THE FIRST RECORD I EVER BOUGHTPass the Dutchie by Musical Youth (1982) I must have been seven or eight when I bought this novelty reggae song on seven-inch. I was a working actor at the time \u2013 I\u2019d been in 100 commercials, and guested on various TV shows \u2013 so I had a few dollars in my pocket. As I recall, this cost me $3.50. I took it home and couldn\u2019t stop playing it: I was just obsessed with the upbeat rhythm. I had no idea what reggae music was, but it spoke to me. The fact it was being performed by children \u2013 Musical Youth were all kids \u2013 made me start to think that music might be something I could do, too. Of course I didn\u2019t know what a dutchie was back then, though. I\u00a0do\u00a0now. THE RECORD THAT INTRODUCED ME TO FEMALE SINGER-SONGWRITERSGonna Take a Miracle by Laura\u00a0Nyro (1971) My mother had a great vinyl collection, and she was constantly playing female singer-songwriters. I first learned about classic song structures by listening to them, and Laura Nyro particularly stood out. Her voice was outside what you\u2019d usually hear on the radio; that really appealed to me. I grew up singing with my mom and sister, so I loved its strong gospel feeling, with Labelle [a vocal group of the 60s and\u00a070s, with Patti LaBelle as lead vocalist] backing Nyro. It seemed to fit in with the way we all related to each other as a family: whenever things were weird around the house, we\u2019d sing a song. THE ALBUM THAT SUMS UP MY YEARS AS A TEENAGE RAVER3 Feet High and Rising by De\u00a0La Soul (1989) My mother\u2019s records were formative for me, but when I became a teenager, I wanted to find songs that she wasn\u2019t hip to. She was so hip, though, that I had to go outside rock\u2019n\u2019roll \u2013 so for about 10 years, I only listened to hip-hop, house and techno. My friends and I were all ravers \u2013 we went to those first underground raves in LA in the 90s, which were really wild. We were kids \u2013 15 and 16 years old \u2013 driving around with strangers; we\u2019d go to a shop at midnight on Melrose, and they\u2019d have a little print-out with directions to the club. It could be out in Palm Springs, or downtown LA, or Orange Country; we\u2019d get there at 2am and rave until 10. I can\u2019t believe our parents let us stay out that late \u2013 I did sneak out my window a few times. But my mom was still down with hip-hop. She\u2019d answer the phone to me, like, \u201cYo yo yo, what\u2019s\u00a0up?\u201d THE RECORD THAT REMINDS ME OF\u00a0TRAVELLINGExile in Guyville by Liz Phair (1993) When I was 18, I took a trip to Thailand with a friend. We stayed for a month. Bangkok was very raw, for a teenager: there were no cellphones, no internet, and the only music I had with me was this cassette by Liz Phair. I was writing a lot of poetry, and she embodied a talky style of songwriting that I found very accessible. I listened to the album over and over again on my Walkman. I remember vividly taking a tiny ferryboat from Bangkok to a little island, listening to this and thinking, \u201cHoly shit, I hope one day I can make music like this.\u201d THE ALBUM I WISH I\u2019D MADE MYSELFWit\u2019s End by Cass McCombs (2011) This is the perfect folk record. The songs are so classic, and I really love his direct way of songwriting. I\u2019ve met Cass a couple of times out at this surf shop in Venice Beach called Mollusk. It\u2019s a tiny little place where all these LA musicians get together; you can drink beer, sit on the floor, and watch these great improvisers riffing off one another. I saw Cass play there, and he was amazing. It all comes back to the songs: they are of such quality that I always want to hear what he has to say. THE RECORD THAT MOST INSPIRES ME AS A SONGWRITERDead Dog\u2019s Eyeball by Kathy McCarty (2005) McCarty is a former waitress from Austin, Texas. She befriended the great Daniel Johnston, and decided to make this record of his songs. It\u2019s one of the best, most story-driven collection of songs I know. They\u2019re both simple and profound; each line punches you in the gut. There\u2019s a really beautiful song called Hey Joe; it\u2019s about depression and mental illness, but you\u2019d never know that unless you knew a little bit about Daniel Johnston\u2019s backstory [Johnston has been diagnosed with an extreme form of bipolar disorder]. With a female vocalist interpreting these songs, they seem so much more polished.      THE ONE THAT CLEARS MY\u00a0HEADReunion with Chet Baker by the Gerry Mulligan Quartet (1957) When you\u2019re talking about your own music every day, listening to bands, going to festivals, you can kind of lose sight of your initial connection with music. Instrumental music \u2013 especially jazz \u2013 helps me refocus. Jazz was, again, something my mum always played around the house \u2013 but this record is particularly special. There\u2019s something about its west-coast sound \u2013 two horns, trumpet, baritone sax; it\u2019s just beautiful, otherworldly. I have it on vinyl and on a CD I bought so long ago that it\u2019s covered in scratches. The album acts like a reset button for me: whenever I put it on, it clears the\u00a0decks. THE RECORD THAT KEEPS ME IN TOUCH WITH HOMEThe Very Best of Ethiopiques (2007) My boyfriend Johnathan and I listen to a lot of world music together, and we particularly love this beautiful compilation. When I\u2019m not with him, out on the road, I put on this record, and it\u2019s like I\u2019m home again. Modern technology makes being apart much more manageable \u2013 I can just Skype him when I\u2019m in hotel rooms doing my nails, or something \u2013 but this record makes me feel like he\u2019s here with me.

If the news that in the past 40 years the world has lost over 50% of its vertebrate wildlife (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish) fails to tell us that there is something wrong with the way we live, it\u2019s hard to imagine what could. Who believes that a social and economic system which has this effect is a healthy one? Who, contemplating this loss, could call it progress? In fairness to the modern era, this is an extension of a trend that has lasted some 2 million years. The loss of much of the African megafauna \u2013 sabretooths and false sabretooths, giant hyaenas and amphicyonids (bear dogs), several species of elephant \u2013 coincided with the switch towards meat eating by hominims (ancestral humans). It\u2019s hard to see what else could have been responsible for the peculiar pattern of extinction then. As we spread into other continents, their megafauna almost immediately collapsed. Perhaps the most reliable way of dating the first arrival of people anywhere is the sudden loss of large animals. The habitats we see as pristine \u2013 the Amazon rainforest or coral reefs for example \u2013 are in fact almost empty: they have lost most of the great beasts that used to inhabit them, which drove crucial natural processes. Since then we have worked our way down the foodchain, rubbing out smaller predators, medium-sized herbivores, and now, through both habitat destruction and hunting, wildlife across all classes and positions in the foodweb. There seems to be some kink in the human brain that prevents us from stopping, that drives us to carry on taking and competing and destroying, even when there is no need to do so. But what we see now is something new: a speed of destruction that exceeds even that of the first settlement of the Americas, 14,000 years ago, when an entire hemisphere\u2019s ecology was transformed through a firestorm of extinction within a few dozen generations, in which the majority of large vertebrate species disappeared. Many people blame this process on human population growth, and there\u2019s no doubt that it has been a factor. But two other trends have developed even faster and further. The first is the rise in consumption; the second is amplification by technology. Every year, new pesticides, fishing technologies, mining methods, techniques for processing trees are developed. We are waging an increasingly asymmetric war against the living world.      Dead popocha fish wash up in the Cajititlan lagoon in Tlajomulco de Zuniga, Jalisco state, Mexico in September. Effluent from a wastewater treatment plant may have caused the mass death of fish.  Photograph: Hector Guerrero/AFP/Getty Images    But why are we at war? In the rich nations, which commission much of this destruction through imports, most of our consumption has nothing to do with meeting human needs. This is what hits me harder than anything: the disproportion between what we lose and what we gain. Economic growth in a country whose primary and secondary needs have already been met means developing ever more useless stuff to meet ever fainter desires. For example, a vague desire to amuse friends and colleagues (especially through the Secret Santa nonsense) commissions the consumption of thousands of tonnes of metal and plastic, often confected into complex electronic novelties: toys for adults. They might provoke a snigger or two, then they are dumped in a cupboard. After a few weeks, scarcely used, they find their way into landfill. In a society bombarded by advertising and driven by the growth imperative, pleasure is reduced to hedonism and hedonism is reduced to consumption. We use consumption as a cure for boredom, to fill the void that an affectless, grasping, atomised culture creates, to brighten the grey world we have created. We care ever less for the possessions we buy, and dispose of them ever more quickly. Yet the extraction of the raw materials required to produce them, the pollution commissioned in their manufacturing, the infrastructure and noise and burning of fuel needed to transport them are trashing a natural world infinitely more fascinating and intricate than the stuff we produce. The loss of wildlife is a loss of wonder and enchantment, of the magic with which the living world infects our lives.  Perhaps it is misleading to suggest that \u201cwe\u201d are doing all this. It\u2019s being done not only by us but to us. One of the remarkable characteristics of recent growth in the rich world is how few people benefit. Almost all the gains go to a tiny number of people: one study suggests that the richest 1% in the United States capture 93% of the increase in incomes that growth delivers. Even with growth rates of 2 or 3% or more, working conditions for most people continue to deteriorate, as we find ourselves on short contracts, without full employment rights, without the security or the choice or the pensions their parents enjoyed. Working hours rise, wages stagnate or fall, tasks become duller, more stressful and harder to fulfill, emails and texts and endless demands clatter inside our heads, shutting down the ability to think, corners are cut, services deteriorate, housing becomes almost impossible to afford, there\u2019s ever less money for essential public services. What and whom is this growth for? It\u2019s for the people who run or own the banks, the hedge funds, the mining companies, the advertising firms, the lobbying companies, the weapons manufacturers, the buy-to-let portfolios, the office blocks, the country estates, the offshore accounts. The rest of us are induced to regard it as necessary and desirable through a system of marketing and framing so intensive and all-pervasive that it amounts to brainwashing.     A man walking past an antique and ivory store in Bangkok, February 28, 2013. Photograph: Pornchai Kittiwongsakul/AFP/Getty Images    A system that makes us less happy, less secure, that narrows and impoverishes our lives, is presented as the only possible answer to our problems. There is no alternative \u2013 we must keep marching over the cliff. Anyone who challenges it is either ignored or excoriated. And the beneficiaries? Well they are also the biggest consumers, using their spectacular wealth to exert impacts thousands of times greater than most people achieve. Much of the natural world is destroyed so that the very rich can fit their yachts with mahogany, eat bluefin tuna sushi, scatter ground rhino horn over their food, land their private jets on airfields carved from rare grasslands, burn in one day as much fossil fuel as the average global citizen uses in a year. Thus the Great Global Polishing proceeds, wearing down the knap of the Earth, rubbing out all that is distinctive and peculiar, in human culture as well as nature, reducing us to replaceable automata within a homogenous global workforce, inexorably transforming the riches of the natural world into a featureless monoculture. Is this not the point at which we shout stop? At which we use the extraordinary learning and expertise we have developed to change the way we organise ourselves, to contest and reverse the trends that have governed our relationship with the living planet for the past 2m years, and that are now destroying its remaining features at astonishing speed?  Is this not the point at which we challenge the inevitability of endless growth on a finite planet? If not now, when?

Thai police officers threatened the two suspects with electrocution during a violent interrogation before the pair agreed to admit to killing Hannah Witheridge and David Miller, according to a Burmese embassy lawyer who spoke to the men on Tuesday. Aung Myo Thant told Burmese media that one of the suspects, Win Zaw Htun, 21, was beaten by police and an interpreter after initially refusing to admit the murders. \u201cHe didn\u2019t confess when he was in the investigation centre,\u201d Aung Myo Thant told the Burmese newspaper Irrawaddy. \u201cA police officer hit the side of his face and the interpreter also hit him four times. Then police threatened to electrocute [the suspects] and said that no worse thing would happen to them if they confessed. So they finally confessed as they saw no hope.\u201d The allegations come after three other Burmese migrant workers said they had been assaulted and scalded with boiling water during a police interrogation. Photographic evidence of their alleged abuse, seen by the Guardian, has been passed to the British ambassador to Thailand, Mark Kent, as calls grow for an independent inquiry. Thai police announced last week that Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both 21, had confessed to murdering Witheridge, 23, and Miller, 24, on a beach on the island of Koh Tao on 15 September. According to an account of their confessions given by Thai police, the suspects encountered the British backpackers embracing on the beach in the early hours of the morning. They are then said to have bludgeoned Miller and left him to drown in the surf before raping and killing Witheridge. Andy Hall, the international affairs adviser of the Burmese Migrant Worker Rights Network, called for an urgent investigation into the abuse allegations, which have been denied by Thai police. He told the Guardian: \u201cAllegations of physical or any other kind of abuse, intimidation or pressure by law enforcement officials or those working alongside such officials during a criminal investigation process \u2013 whether inflicted on those formally detained and accused of a crime or simply against those suspected of a crime \u2013 are serious violations of human rights and should have urgently and independently been investigated.\u201d A team of migrant rights activists has been dispatched to the island of Koh Samui to meet the two murder suspects, who are being held in prison before a court appearance on Wednesday. A third Burmese man is being held in custody as a witness. Hall, a British human rights activist based in Thailand, said: \u201cWe have undertaken this mission as a number of serious allegations of physical abuse against Myanmar workers as part of the questioning process in this murder case have been raised to us in the past week or so.\u201d Testimony seen by the Guardian indicates that the other three Burmese workers were accosted by police on 27 September while they played takoh (cane ball) on Koh Tao. After being hauled in for questioning, it is alleged they were beaten by police and scalded with boiling water. The men, who work on the island, were then released. The abuse allegations were emphatically denied by Thai police at a press conference in Bangkok. Police colonel Prachum Ruangthong said he had met with Burmese embassy officials \u2013 who had received complaints of police misconduct \u2013 and discussed with them the allegations of false evidence and torture. \u201cThey were satisfied with our explanations,\u201d Prachum said. The police also fought back against accusations that the Burmese suspects were little more than scapegoats for possibly higher-profile culprits \u2013 a theory suggested by various human rights groups, migrant rights activists and media outlets. Police said investigators relied on witness testimony, CCTV evidence and DNA tests \u2013 particularly evidence taken from cigarettes found at the crime scene \u2013 to come to their conclusions and that their investigation was by the book. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to create scapegoats in 2014, since it is easier for police to be grilled by the public,\u201d Prachum was quoted as saying by the Bangkok Post. Court proceedings against the murder suspects are expected to begin on Wednesday on the nearby island of Surin. The head of the investigation, Major General Paween Pongsirin, told the online news portal Phuketwan that the case was now \u201cready to proceed\u201d after \u201csome error[s]\u201d occurred in the first few days of the investigation. \u201cWednesday\u2019s hearing will give the various interested parties the opportunity to hear for themselves what we have learned,\u201d he said. A Foreign Office spokesman said: \u201cWe are concerned about the reports of allegations of mistreatment and expect these to be dealt with appropriately. The investigation and judicial process remains a matter for the Thai authorities, but we expect it to be conducted in a fair and transparent way.

But probably not on the street \u2013 vendors in trucks and gazebos have a hard time securing permission and space from councils, so they gather in disused car parks at night, or form mini food terraces in the privately owned public spaces that fill British cities. At the Trinity shopping centre in\u00a0Leeds, a scissor elevator hoists repurposed horse boxes up the outside of the building and into the first-floor food court. The wheels of street food are turning so fast that soon they won\u2019t touch the ground: the developers of Battersea power station, in south London, promise a third-floor street food market \u201cin the sky\u201d. SSP, the company responsible for all those Upper Crusts and Ritazza coffee shops in train stations and airports, is signing up food trucks. There is something touchingly double-edged about the idea of a mobile vendor stuck at a transport terminal. It seems both brilliant for travellers looking for food, and contrary to the promise of free-roaming, pop-up, impulsive, informal dining that first took hungry people to trucks. As if to prove that street food is reaching saturation point, even KFC now runs a truck, and the street food vendor is a trope of romcoms (see Chef, The Five-Year Engagement, etc). Usually, because street food is seen as a kind of social saviour, the vendor as he appears in romcoms is a guy in search of a life with more soul. No wonder that in parts of the US, food writers have decreed the\u00a0end of the food truck. But what about Britain? Has the street food revolution, as one book has it, democratised good honest food or moved it further from reach? Let\u2019s lift the romcom guy across the\u00a0Atlantic \u2013 perhaps with the help of a scissor elevator \u2013 and picture him walking into last month\u2019s British Street Food awards. In Leeds\u2019s Millennium Square, food trucks are arranged in a squared-off figure of eight. Each looks different. (The image the trucks project is as important as the food they sell.) One, the Hip Hop Chip Shop, is a brilliant boombox, with artwork courtesy of\u00a0the illustrator Stanley Chow. Fresh Rootz is a jigsaw of salvaged wood. The soft-shell crab tempura vendor has\u00a0squirted builder\u2019s foam into a sand mould to make a giant crab claw for his\u00a0shack. A\u00a0man scuttles into a truck wearing an ornamental apron that says: \u201cFuck off, I\u2019m busy.\u201d It\u2019s all pretty idyllic. The owners of these joints have made their way here from different life paths. The brains behind the Hip Hop Chip Shop has a career in advertising; Spud from Fresh Rootz worked with people with challenging behaviour. Douglas Ritchie-Robertson of the Crabbie Shack was once lead singer with the Chineapples. James Tabor, of Dogtown hot dogs, came to street food via Felsted boarding school and a career as a City trader. What has brought them all here is a\u00a0passion for food, the desire to create something original, tasty and fun, to enjoy self-governance in the workplace, to be free\u00a0to roll. You can see where romcom scriptwriters were going with this one.     Diners enjoying street food at Exmouth Market in central London. Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    Actually, what has brought them all here, as well as their passion for food, are the efforts of Richard Johnson who, in 2010, founded the British Street Food awards, and who is also responsible for winching those food carts into Leeds\u2019s Trinity shopping mall. (His is another career-change story: in his previous life, he was a food and drink writer.) \u201cThere is big, serious money floating around street food,\u201d he says. \u201cIt all comes from venture capital. Some of the most exciting restaurant openings of the past few years have been rooted in street food.\u201d He cites Meat Wagon, Pitt Cue, Pizza Pilgrims, all of which started as trucks and now have fixed-venue catering empires. \u201cThere is a whole raft waiting to join them, and for very obvious reasons. We are in a society that values realness. The whole thing of keeping it real \u2013 that\u2019s what these brands offer.\u201d This year alone, between 600 and 700 new street food businesses have signed up to Nationwide Caterers Association, a rise of 100% on last year\u2019s figures. Around 2,000 street food businesses are estimated to trade in Britain, touring events everywhere from Devon to Norwich, Brighton to Glasgow. A sub-industry has grown up of businesses that nurture new street food outlets, such as Kitchenette, which helps to get traders started, loans out stalls at markets and advises on health-and-safety requirements in return for a slice of profits. Its\u00a0financial model is based around the idea that some of the companies it helps will launch fixed premises and then multiples \u2013 The Good Egg is expected to do so soon. Even for established traders, the street food chain usually includes a facilitator role. Traders at the British Street Food awards, or the London-based Kerb, for instance, pay 15% of their takings to the organiser. Johnson\u2019s diagnosis of the value of \u201crealness\u201d is correct, at least according to comments from some of the 7,000 or\u00a0so people who have paid \u00a38 in order to enter Leeds\u2019s normally open Millennium Square and spend money on the finalists. \u201cIt has to be authentic.\u201d \u201cYou can see who\u2019s cooking it.\u201d \u201cThe people who are here, it\u2019s their life, their passion.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all about authenticity and taste.\u201d But the authenticity of British street food (this wave of it, at least: it\u2019s good to remember that archaeological digs of Roman Britain frequently turn up oyster shells from ancient street stalls) is evolving. Tucked away in a corner of Millennium Square is Buddha Belly, owned by 28-year-old Sai Deethwa. Street food is in Deethwa\u2019s blood. Her\u00a0mother has a street food stall in Gloucester, before which she ran one in\u00a0her native Thailand. Deethwa\u2019s cousins have stalls in Bangkok; her aunt has a shack in Sikhoraphum. Back in January, on her first trip to\u00a0Thailand, Deethwa visited her aunt\u2019s shack, \u201ca sort of 7-11 of street food. Quite a lot of the neighbours are elderly. They all come to her for their tea. They\u00a0can get a really good, hearty meal cooked fresh for them for about 30\u00a0baht \u2013 50p.\u201d     Sai Deethwa of Buddha Belly in the Trinity Kitchen in Leeds\u2019s Trinity shopping centre. Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian    Deethwa looks up at her own gazebo, which she recently took a fortnight off trading to decorate. It looks great, mainly because when she was invited to take part in the Trinity food court, Johnson \u201cwanted a different kind of look\u201d. He didn\u2019t want any plastic or anything that looked like a gazebo. So now Buddha Belly has wooden pallet walls, bamboo at the counter and fully tiled kitchen-like worksurfaces. It looks the part, and Deethwa\u2019s cooking is great: the heat of her beef massuman creeps up, gives time to enjoy the flavours, before curling slowly around the mouth. She charges \u00a35 or \u00a36 for this\u00a0experience. \u201cWe want it to be affordable,\u201d she says, unlike the trader she has seen elsewhere, who is charging \u00a311 for a double-stacked burger. \u201cIf we\u2019re verging on the \u00a310 mark, it takes the joy out of street food.\u201d How does Deethwa think street food in Britain differs to the experience in Thailand? She looks around the square. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to imagine my auntie now, if she came here. She\u2019d be like: \u2018What is this?\u2019 She\u2019d probably think, \u2018That looks organised!\u2019 I don\u2019t know if \u2018gimmicky\u2019 is the right word, but they obviously focus a lot on your setup now in street food. Not upmarket. But the glitzy, glamour side of street food, whereas theirs is everyday living. Necessity, almost.\u201d And then she adds: \u201cShe\u00a0would be really impressed.\u201d Actually, \u201cupmarket\u201d is exactly what British street food, at least in this incarnation, has become: a sort of upcycled market, typified by farmers\u2019 markets, those havens for middle-class shoppers in search of an artisanal experience. Such is the evolution of street food that the term itself, far from implying cheap hotdogs, has become a\u00a0designation of quality, and the street, by implication, a place of gentrified consumerism, where the chef takes your money and gives you the time of day. The food may be genuinely good, but the way that street food has become organised, and developed its own conventions of presentation, has taken it another step further from the street.

She arrives at the Shoreditch Grind coffee bar, beside Old Street roundabout. She orders a cornflake soft-serve ice cream, and for the next hour she fidgets nonstop on one of the picnic-style benches wedged between the coffee shop and the graffitied wall of the neighbouring cocktail bar. It is easy to see why an itinerant career would appeal to her. Barran runs Kerb, a company along the lines of Johnson\u2019s, which acts as an intermediary between street food vendors and the landlords of potential host sites. Nine years ago, Barran underwent her own romcom-style epiphany, the first of two, when she abandoned her four-year career cleaning private yachts with toothpicks and bought an ice-cream van on eBay. As Choc Star, she toured the UK, worked festivals, earned plaudits for her chocolate confections. The second epiphany came five years ago, after a festival organiser cancelled an event at short notice and declined to return the grand she had paid him upfront. \u201cI thought: that\u2019s bullshit,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re vulnerable on our own; combined we\u2019re not.\u201d That\u2019s when she started a collective of traders, which soon became Kerb, with its \u201curban agenda to transform the space between buildings and to humanise spaces in London with good people creating good food and attracting a food-loving public, whoever they happen to be. Inclusively.\u201d In the nine years since Barran started fly-pitching in the Choc Star van, street food has come a long way. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely changing and I often think to myself: \u2018I\u00a0wonder what it would be like to be a trader now.\u2019 If I was still running my van, I\u2019d probably be making more money. I\u2019d probably be more busy. Would I like it? Would I want to get into this scene if it was already a scene? Probably not.\u201d Barran is not alone in her disquiet at watching the \u201cscene\u201d coagulate. Scott Collins, of Meat Liquor fame, got into street food when he gave use of the car park at his pub the Florence, in south London, to Yianni Papoutsis for his now-infamous MeatWagon. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine doing it now,\u201d he says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to touch it.\u201d When the MeatWagon started, \u201cyou didn\u2019t need a collective. People would travel for that one product and queue for hours.\u201d     Where it all began: the MeatWagon, a 1980s Chevrolet ambulance. Photograph: Danny Elwes/Evening Standard / eyevine    Interestingly, none of the early traders thought of themselves as purveyors of street food. For Papoutsis, it was \u201cguerilla dining\u201d. Barran was \u201ca\u00a0mobile food trader\u201d. At Kerb now they\u2019re \u201cspace hunters\u201d. \u201cStreet food\u201d itself seems a term that has arisen from the sector\u2019s growing self-consciousness. Use the phrase for your wares, and you\u2019re on to a winner. The apotheosis of this development may be the launch last weekend of a street food \u201croadshow\u201d, which takes trucks to retail parks around the north of England. The term \u201cstreet food roadshow\u201d is so tautologous it is tempting to think that the idea has eaten itself. After all, if street food were truly of the street, it wouldn\u2019t need a roadshow. Perhaps this is just an unfortunate choice of phrase. Like Barran, and no doubt many market entrepreneurs, Johnson \u2013 who is curating the roadshow \u2013 sees his job as \u201ca conduit\u201d, a guarantor of authenticity. Barran says: \u201cPart of Kerb\u2019s role is to protect against naffness and cynicism. There\u2019s a lot of people sizing street food up. Big companies: \u2018I\u00a0want to take ownership of that. Let\u2019s take that, and put it on our campus.\u2019\u201d The restaurant chains Wahaca and Byron are among those to have experimented with street food. Johnson is working with others. Ritchie-Robertson says he has had Marks &amp; Spencer reps buy his crab tempura just to take it apart in front of him.

Photograph: Pal Hansen for the Observer    When this wave of street food began, it was unorganised. Traders needed only tweet their location \u2013 or invite offers of a free spot \u2013 and food fans would turn up, just like a rave. It was a\u00a0new scene with a music crossover. From outside, it looked subcultural, and small proofs of this linger in the presentation memes of traders. Take the graffiti-style signage. The propensity for puns, as if language, like cuisine, were something to be fused and mashed. The rebellious \u201cZ\u201d of Fresh Rootz, BBQ Dreamz and others. Street style, street art, street justice, street photography \u2026 Pretty much anything can be prefixed with \u201cstreet\u201d to make it sound sharper. (The term \u201cstreet cred\u201d is a good demonstration of how calling anything \u201cstreet\u201d suggests it has ceased to be so.) Now street-style bloggers are on fashion\u2019s front row. Street art is in galleries. It was almost exactly 20 years ago that Ted Polhemus published his groundbreaking book Street Style. Perhaps he can shed some light on the street food phenomenon? These days Polhemus lives in Hastings, where \u201cstreet food\u201d mainly means \u201cpeople wolfing down fish and chips in a seafront shelter on a grey day\u201d. Like the visitors to Leeds\u2019s Millennium Square, he thinks \u201cthe idea of street is bound up with our great obsession with authenticity. We\u2019re in this desperate search for something that\u2019s real. But street isn\u2019t a real place,\u201d he says. \u201cWe see it as the ultimate in authenticity, but it\u2019s a mythical place.\u201d From where he\u2019s sitting at home, chatting on the phone, Polhemus catches sight of a cookbook, Street Food in Japan. There has been a spate of such books, taking street food from outside into the domestic kitchen. Perhaps the place we really want our street food is indoors, in shopping malls and the comfort of our own homes.

Its\u00a0thematic preoccupations, however, are more narrowly focused, often concerned with the literal or figurative destruction of beauty, and the seemingly endless ways in which white masculinity can come unstuck. The title story is one of several set in\u00a0Medford, Massachusetts, where Theroux grew up, sometime around the middle of the last century. Exploring the lives of white working-class families, sons taking stock of their unknowable fathers, fathers bewildering their children and alienating their wives, the stories pick away at the usual torments and dramas texturing the precarious edges of American society. The narrator of &quot;Mr Bones&quot; recalls that his timid shoe-salesman father was &quot;so\u00a0thoroughly nice&quot; it never occurred to his family that they might not really know a man whose &quot;smiles made him an enigma&quot;. The father&apos;s catastrophic purchase of a decrepit house in an undesirable neighbourhood opens him up to the ceaseless nagging of his wife, who is desperate to live in a home that is not falling down. With little warning, this milquetoast father gradually assumes an alternative personality, the\u00a0Mr Bones of the title. A black-faced minstrel, all &quot;swagger and assurance&quot;, he answers back to his wife and scolds his children with a litany of angry, passive-aggressive jokes. &quot;Swanking in\u00a0the role of a comical slave&quot;, the narrator&apos;s father &quot;became a frightening master \u2026 so strange we had no way of responding to his tyrannical teasing&quot;. Such aggressive acts of performance are a recurring motif. In &quot;Minor Watt&quot;, winner of the 2011 National Magazine award for best story in the US, the eponymous character is a vastly wealthy man with an extraordinary collection of\u00a0art and artefacts who embarks on a spree of systematic destruction as the ultimate expression of ownership. To be free to destroy a valuable object is to\u00a0own it absolutely, with no sense of stewardship on behalf of wider human culture. Like Mr Bones, but on a far grander scale, Minor Watt is both mystery and menace, his acts of wanton annihilation empowering him just as intensely as they alienate those who cherish all that he revels in destroying. Similarly, in &quot;Our Raccoon Year&quot;, the\u00a0narrator, Henry, recalls the months after his mother abruptly left home and his father won custody of him and his brother. All seemed well in this exclusively male world until a family of raccoons began to infest their rural property, the animals&apos; presence driving his father towards ever more sadistic means of eradicating the creatures that\u00a0his sons regarded as cartoon-like friends. In one horrific scene the narrator is forced to watch as his father drowns a trapped raccoon, &quot;with hands like mine, black fingers hooked in the mesh&quot; of the cage. Surely, we imagine, the boys risk a comparable fate. The trope of the solitary man whose derangements alienate those around him \u2013 either through acts of violent destruction, performance, or creation \u2013 is fertile ground for Theroux. The second half of the collection, however, begins to turn away from violence towards love, or at least the often-compromised liaisons that pass for it\u00a0in\u00a0Theroux&apos;s world. In &quot;Siamese Nights&quot;, Boyd Osier, an American working in Bangkok, meets and falls in\u00a0love with Song, a transgender prostitute. Boyd&apos;s discovery of a different sexual self, and of his capacity to lie to\u00a0his wife in America, is as profound an encounter with otherness as his growing infatuation with Song. The concluding story, &quot;I&apos;m the Meat, You&apos;re the Knife&quot;, finds Jay, a writer, returning to Medford for his father&apos;s funeral. Instead of focusing on the grief of his family, he is distracted by news that his high-school English teacher, Murray Cutler, is dying in a\u00a0hospice. Jay begins visiting Cutler, telling the sick man stories that are often about forms of violation or sexual assault. For Jay, this act of menacing narration is a form of revenge, his stories designed to remind Cutler of the abuse he perpetrated against Jay as a boy. Essentially about the terrorising power of fiction, the story suggests that, as Jay&apos;s mentor as well as his violator, Cutler wounded the boy in the same moment that he shaped him into the writer who would one day return to seek retribution. The best of these stories channel a\u00a0Cheever-like weirdness, plumbing the\u00a0depths of eccentricity and violence swilling beneath the surface of ordinary American life. Theroux understands, often with devastating effect, how dramas both big and small can produce\u00a0catastrophic and lasting psychological consequences. \u2022 Patrick Flanery&apos;s Fallen Land is published by Atlantic.

Amid a confusing picture fresh doubts have also been raised about forensic evidence supporting the case. Thailand\u2019s most prominent forensic investigator has questioned why an expert in the area was not used to collect samples following the discovery on 15 September of the murdered Britons, Hannah Witheridge and David Miller, on Koh Tao island. On Thursday reports said that a Burmese embassy official, Aung Myo Thant, described as a lawyer, had now formally retracted the statements of the Burmese suspects, Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both 21. He had reported the concerns to the Burmese embassy, the Bangkok Post said, citing Burma\u2019s 7Day newspaper. He was quoted as saying of the suspects: \u201cThey told me that they were on the beach that night drinking and singing songs. They said they didn\u2019t do it, that the Thai police beat them until they confessed to something they didn\u2019t do. They\u2019re pleading with the Burmese government to look into the case and find out the truth. They were a really pitiful sight. Their bodies had all sorts of bruises.\u201d Earlier this week the Burmese men said they had been beaten by police and threatened with electrocution to secure their confessions. Khunying Porntip Rojanasunan, head of Thailand\u2019s forensic science institute, reportedly asked why an expert was not used to collect samples following the murders and why qualified experts seemed not to have been involved in the case, which involved police are were also relying on DNA evidence. Police failing to call a forensic pathologist to oversee officers collecting evidence was a \u201cweak point\u201d in the investigation, she said, according to Burma\u2019s 7Day newspaper, citing a Thai news agency. She added: \u201cA case of two murdered people certainly needs a forensic physician.\u201d Another Thai paper, The Nation, said public prosecutors had returned the police report, asking officers to supply \u201cmore crucial information\u201d. The paper quoted Parinya Sirisarakarn, of Thailand\u2019s national human rights commission, also querying some of the forensic evidence. He said he had also visited the suspects and seen that they showed signs of \u201cthe police not treating them properly\u201d. However, he said the pair, speaking to him, had maintained their confessions. According to police, the two men did confess to the killings. They were believed to have found the Britons embracing on a beach. They allegedly struck Miller, 24, on the head, leaving him to drown in the surf, before raping and killing 23-year-old Witheridge. However, rights groups in Thailand and elsewhere have expressed worries about the police investigation, fearing the migrant workers might be providing make convenient scapegoats so that officials can declare the case closed to assist Thailand\u2019s vital tourist industry. On Thursday Amnesty International has called for an independent investigation into allegations that the suspects were mistreated, and for the suspects to get a fair trial. Richard Bennett, head of Amnesty\u2019s Asia-Pacific region, said: \u201cThe pressure to be seen to be solving an appalling crime that has garnered considerable attention should not result in the violation of rights, including a fair trial.\u201d According to The Nation, in the aftermath of the murders there was a significant drop in tourist arrivals to the island. However numbers were now picking up again, it said. Migrant labour activists in Thailand have expressed concern that those who have apparently held confidential talks with the accused, such as the so-called lawyer from by the Burmese embassy and Sirisarakarn from the national human rights commission, had gone on to speak publicly about the two suspects and what they discussed. Such information can jeopardise a fair trial for those accused, said Andy Hall, a British activist in Thailand, who expressed concern over the media storm relating to the case and possible resulting \u201ctrial by press\u201d. As many as 4 million Burmese migrants currently work in Thailand and it is not uncommon for them to face trouble from Thai police. Hall told the Guardian: \u201cMigrant workers, both irregular and regular, are routinely and unlawfully detained, arrested and extorted in their everyday lives by law enforcement officials whether at their homes, workplaces, when resting and travelling, and even during deportation processes when they are literally sold to ethnic border guards.\u201d Being scapegoated for crimes committed by others is just one of the many threats faced by migrant workers in Thailand, activists allege. In a statement issued this week the Migrant Workers Rights Network (MWRN), which represents nearly 4,000 Burmese labourers in Thailand, said labourers face \u201cserious challenges\u201d while working in Thailand, ranging from confiscated passports and work permits to unlawful arrest, unfair dismissals, extortion, deportation and the risk of being sold to work on Thai fishing boats or as sex workers, \u201cwhere they are forced as human trafficking victims to work as slaves\u201d.", "publicationDate": "2014-10-09T17:55:00Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "South and Central Asia", "World news", "UK news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/thailand-backpacker-murders-suspects-confession-retract", "title": "Suspects in Thai backpacker murders retract confessions, says official", "sentences": ["He had reported the concerns to the Burmese embassy, the Bangkok Post said, citing Burma\u2019s 7Day newspaper."]}, {"article": "Thailand\u2019s prime minister has defended the police investigation into the murder of two British tourists last month, saying the UK and other nations should \u201cunderstand\u201d that the correct culprits had been caught. The comments by Prayuth Chan-ocha came on his return from a visit to Burma, the home of the two migrant workers arrested for allegedly killing Hannah Witheridge and David Miller on the island of Koh Tao. The suspects have said they were beaten by police and threatened with electrocution to confess, and a Burmese embassy-appointed lawyer said the confessions had now been retracted. While Prayuth was in Burma he was lobbied by the country\u2019s president, Thein Sein, to ensure the suspects were treated fairly. \u201cIf they are guilty, action should be taken according to the law. However, the investigation needs to be clean and fair,\u201d the Burmese leader told Prayuth, according to a Burmese official quoted by Agence France-Presse. To coincide with Prayuth\u2019s visit, a small crowd of demonstrators gathered in Burma\u2019s biggest city, Rangoon, to demand a fair trial for their compatriots. The Burmese official said Prayuth had promised to give special consideration to the case. When Prayuth returned to Bangkok, however, he defended the police case and said overseas critics were misinformed. \u201cI would like the media to stop speculation and let investigators do their work,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe must build foreign confidence and make Britain and other foreign nations understand. They might be a little surprised why the criminals were caught so quickly. I myself was excited. I want all Thais to stop and think that authorities have procedures in place. Nobody would dare catch the wrong person because this is a case of big international interest.\u201d His comments follow widespread alarm from rights groups and others that the Burmese suspects could have been made scapegoats for the Britons\u2019 killings on 15 September. According to police, Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both 21, encountered the Britons on a beach and allegedly struck Miller on the head, leaving him to drown in the surf, before raping and killing Witheridge. Witheridge\u2019s funeral took place on Friday in her home village of Hemsby, in Norfolk. A senior policeman in the region said the retraction of the suspects\u2019 confessions was not unexpected. \u201cThe suspects have every right under the law to retract their testimony,\u201d Colonel Prachum Ruengthong, chief of police for Koh Pha Ngan island, whose jurisdiction takes in Koh Tao, was quoted as saying by Thailand\u2019s Khaosod newspaper. \u201cIn many other cases, suspects also recant their confessions during trial. It\u2019s normal.\u201d The father of one of the suspects has asked to be allowed to see his son, saying he does not believe he is guilty. U Tun Tun Hteik told the Burmese Mizzima news agency that he hoped for a fair trial for Win Zaw Htun, the Bangkok Post reported. \u201cI do not believe that my son would commit murder. I think he will be released if the investigation into this case is fair and systematic,\u201d he said. Up to four million Burmese migrants work in Thailand, and groups representing them say it is not uncommon for them to be wrongly accused by police. There was particular pressure on officers to swiftly solve the Koh Tao murders for fear that it might harm the country\u2019s economically vital tourism industry. Witheridge\u2019s funeral was billed by her family as a celebratory \u201cparty\u201d to mark her life, and hundreds of mourners attended wearing bright clothes. A statement released by her family late on Thursday said the weeks following her death had been \u201cunimaginably difficult\u201d. It added: \u201cAs we continue with our plans for our beautiful Hannah\u2019s \u2018party\u2019, our thoughts are with David Miller\u2019s family who are suffering the same indescribable agony. \u201cHannah was a fun, vibrant and beautiful young woman who will be sorely missed by all who knew her. She was dedicated, ambitious and would have made an amazing difference to the lives of many families through her chosen career as a speech and language therapist.

If circumstances were to change even slightly for these people, and they weren\u2019t completely on top of everything, they\u2019d almost immediately find themselves dead at the hands of any of the beastly shadow-dwelling villains that populate their world. But it\u2019s a little harder if you\u2019re a film director, as Joe Wright knows only too well. With his early films like Pride and Prejudice and Atonement, he built a box for himself \u2013 a straight-backed box, full of stiff upper lips, faraway glances and all manner of delicate period flourishes \u2013 that ended up stifling him creatively. So he tried to adapt, by producing more contemporary work. Some of that work included Hanna, and it proved to be such a weird fit that Wright quickly retreated back to the safe comforts of Anna Karenina. He tried to adapt, but right now it looks like he\u2019d rather end up being buried in that box of his. All of which makes Hanna a strange little oddity, a smudge on an otherwise ornate filmography. And that, obviously, makes it the perfect subject for a rewatch.           Watch an exclusive clip from Joe Wright\u2019s Hanna    \u201cSometimes children are bad people, too\u201d \u2013 Marissa Perhaps the biggest problem with Hanna is one of expectation. Until that point, Joe Wright had painstakingly built a career aimed squarely at the awards season solar plexus. Pride and Prejudice and Atonement \u2013 even The Soloist in its own nightmarishly warped way \u2013 were designed to be prestigious, middlebrow, released-in-January fare, precision-engineered to tickle the various fancies of Oscar voters. But Hanna? It\u2019s practically Taken. Watching Hanna is like watching Michael Haneke have a go at Bangkok Dangerous. The upshot of this, at least, is that it can be a painfully beautiful film. The climax, set inside an abandoned fairground complete with a heavy-handedly symbolic set of giant monster jaws, is perfectly staged. The sound design is complex and thoughtful. Freeze-frame any shot containing Saoirse Ronan and you could easily mistake her for an illustration from an antique book of Scandinavian fairytales. A little more time has been spent over the themes of the film than you\u2019d otherwise expect, too \u2013 so much so that at times you want to pause the film, grab Wright by the shoulders and yell \u201cI get it! She just wants a family! Now be quiet and blow more stuff up!\u201d \u2013 which may or may not be to its detriment, depending on how drunk you are.           \u2018I approached it like a dance piece\u2019: Saoirse Ronan and Joe Wright on Hanna - video    \u201cRun little piggy!\u201d \u2013 Isaacs But Hanna\u2019s biggest coup is its cast. As well as Ronan, it stars Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett and Tom Hollander and Olivia Williams and Martin Wuttke. Shepherd that cast into the right material and you\u2019d have a textbook piece of award-bait. Here, though, despite their best efforts to wrestle something meatier out of their roles \u2013 Hollander\u2019s Izzardishly German accent is a case in point \u2013 they\u2019re reduced to little more than utilitarian stock characters. Which brings us back to the Joe Wright problem. Hanna is, basically, fluff; one of those instantly forgettable action flicks that you watch because you\u2019ve seen everything else and you\u2019re a bit drunk. But the cast is so impressive, and the director so prestigious, that it desperately tries to contort itself into fine art at every turn. As a result, it\u2019s at least 20 minutes longer than it really needs to be. Ironically, in the hands of a less skilled director, Hanna would have been a much more enjoyable film.

On a smaller screen, however, they appear to make the film feel about 15 years older than it actually is. \u2022 One thing that made Hanna the character a little harder to like than normal: she is a one-H Hanna.

On top of the escalating Ebola crisis, unabating violence in Syria, terror threats from Isis and the increasingly evident effects of climate change (to name just a handful of concerns), the end of the millenium development goals next year will be an intense period of reflection and future planning.  As the UN approaches its 70th year, it seems a good time to assess the effectiveness of the multilateral body to address the issues of the 21st century. The UN Security Council\u2019s lack of achievement has been well documented. Last year Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon called the war in Syria \u201cour collective failure\u201d which would \u201cremain a heavy burden on the standing of the United Nations\u201d. UN human rights commissioner Navi Pillay went further: \u201cThe killers, destroyers and torturers in Syria have been empowered and emboldened by the international paralysis,\u201d she said when she left her post in August.  Pillay\u2019s accusation centred on the security council\u2019s inabilty to pass a resolution. In September, France proposed changing the process so that in the case of \u201cmass crimes\u201d the five permanent members do not have the power of veto. Britain\u2019s UN ambassador supported the change and so did other representatives, but Russia, China and the United States stayed silent. The US is also guilty of frequently falling to pay its UN member fees.  The US, Britain, France, China and Russia became permanent members in 1946 because they were victors in the Second World War. In 2014, is that still relevant? Is it time that power was distributed more widely, extending perhaps to emerging markets and the Brics countries? Would decision making be even harder with more countries in the inner circle? Of course, the UN\u2019s mission is much more than peacekeeping. Has it done better at promoting development than at preventing war? When all is said and done, should credit be given where it\u2019s due?

On the sidelines of a summit in Milan on Friday David Cameron obtained an agreement from the Thai prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, that British investigators be sent to Koh Tao, a Downing Street source said. The move was an attempt to reassure the families of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, that the judicial process was being carried out in a fair and transparent way and that the murderers would be brought to justice, the source added. The two tourists were found dead on the holiday island of Koh Tao on 15 September. Postmortem examinations showed Witheridge, from Norfolk, had died of head injuries, while Miller, from Jersey, had also suffered severe blows to the head and had drowned in the surf. Two Burmese men, Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both migrant workers aged 21, have been arrested and charged with their murders. But their families have claimed they are scapegoats and have alleged the suspects were beaten by investigators keen to extract confessions \u2013 claims denied by the Thai police. Details of the British police to be sent to Thailand are yet to be ironed out and there was no immediate word on how many investigators would be sent or when. The source said Britain would work to ensure further independent verification of the DNA samples that Thai police claim link the two men to the murders. The other area of concern is the Burmese suspects\u2019 allegations of mistreatment. The duo have claimed they were beaten by police and threatened with electrocution unless they confessed. There have been conflicting reports about whether or not those confessions have since been retracted. Thai police have said they believe the pair stumbled on the Britons on a beach and allegedly gave Miller a blow to the head before raping and killing Witheridge. They are adamant the DNA link is \u201cconcrete\u201d and that the men\u2019s claims of torture do not stand up to scrutiny. Human rights groups in Thailand and internationally have expressed concerns about the investigation, raising the possibility that their quick arrests might be a tool for the tourist-dependent country to avoid the negative publicity of a drawn-out murder investigation. Prayuth \u2013 who has also come under pressure in Burma to ensure the suspects are treated fairly \u2013 has defended the Thai police. \u201cWe must build foreign confidence and make Britain and other foreign nations understand,\u201d he said after a visit to Burma last week. \u201cThey might be a little surprised why the criminals were caught so quickly. I myself was excited. I want all Thais to stop and think that authorities have procedures in place.

I am a lecturer in Criminology at Plymouth University, and have recently written a book called 'Contemporary adulthood and the night-time economy' which attempts to explore the cultural and aesthetic attachment we have to alcohol, as well as reconsider how we think about and use our city centres. I look forward to discussing the questions around the notion of 24-hour cites over the coming hour.             Guardian contributor     WilliamStraw    24 October 2014 1:25pm  Hi everyone. I'm happy to be part of this discussion. I teach at McGill University in Montreal,Canada, with a particular interest in cultural scenes and night-life. I run a website, www.theurbannight.com, in which I track developments related to how cities are managing their nights.             Guardian contributor     AndreinaSeijas    24 October 2014 1:42pm  Hello, my name is Andreina Seijas. I am a Venezuelan journalist with a background in social policy and public administration. For a few years now, I have been fascinated by how cities can become more attractive, socially cohesive and competitive places by better regulating and expanding their night-time economies and night life in general. You can read some of my work in my website: http://www.andreinaseijas.com/ I currently work for the Emerging and Sustainable Cities Initiative of the Inter-American Development Bank, from where I seek to assist intermediate-sized cities and municipalities in Latin America and the Caribbean in developing sound night-time policies that can attract investment as well as promote a better quality of life for their citizens.             Guardian contributor     KeithFoley    24 October 2014 1:47pm  Good afternoon everyone. I'm Keith Foley, Head of Night Tube programme at London Underground. It's my responsibility to deliver the Night Tube into service having led the work to determine that London could really benefit from this enhancement to our public transport. Initially this is on 5 lines overnight on Fridays and Saturdays where there is existing proven demand for transport.      ID7857147 asks:  24h tube service is great as it might create more work for transport/and night-leisure activities, but how does being a city that parties longer into the night better our economy? Wouldn\u2019t this potentially attract a new kind of mad-party tourism and increase insecurity levels?          Guardian contributor     KeithFoley    24 October 2014 1:56pm  24 hour cities are not just ones that &quot;party longer into the night&quot; but rather those that have a diverse range of economic activity. TfL commissioned a report from Economic consultants Volterra who identified benefits in a range of sectors, delivering jobs and improving safety of journeys for those thousands of workers who already travel overnight on London's extensive bus network.Night Tube will make travel to and from work safer, quicker and more reliable for everyone wishing to work overnight         \u2018Street life at night in Istanbul.\u2019 Photograph: tynegal/GuardianWitness    GerardoGonzalez says:  I went to Istanbul last year and was suprised with the night economy. Even after public transport stopped many places kept running - targeted not only at the tourists but also for the locals. At the moment that the public transport stops there are three options -your own transport taxis and walking. This happens in may cities including my own - Caracas - My question is: To what degree is the night economy totally dependent on public transport? In most cities people look for strategies to movilize and at the same time many jobs are created from this.          Guardian contributor     WilliamStraw    24 October 2014 2:02pm  In Montreal, our relatively new mayor tried to extend bar closing times on a couple of strips in the city, and got his hands slapped by the provincial alcohol licensing authority because he hadn't consulted with the transit authority, community groups or any other players. Clearly, any such initiative requires a comprehensive involvement of all stakeholders.      margaretsharkey asks:  What about the link between night-shift work and breast cancer (&amp; probably other cancers) established by International Agency for Research on Cancer - part of WHO http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2007/pr180.html ? I bet employers thinking of extending staff hours through the night are not currently hard at work doing risk assessments to look at ways of preventing this!          Guardian contributor     AndreinaSeijas    24 October 2014 1:54pm  Dear Margaret, that's a very good point. However, the way that night shift work may increase breast cancer is still not clear. Some experts point out that it may have to do with the lack of quality sleep that some female night-time workers suffer from. In general, women are much more vulnerable than men during the night, and that's a very important factor to take into account when designing night-time policies. The notion of the Night-Time Economy (NTE) involves regulating the labor conditions for those who work at night. To do that, we must first raise awareness of both the economic and social importance of the NTE, and encourage our governments to take measures that ensure that those who work at night can do it in dignified conditions (proper transport, wages, etc.)             Guardian contributor     OliverSmith1    24 October 2014 2:06pm  I think the question of employment within the 24-hour city is a vital one. The creation of numerous new employment opportunities within the NTE is no doubt great news for government ministers, but lets not forget that may of these new \u2018opportunities\u2019 are poorly paid, transitory and non-unionised, within an industry renowned for the enthusiastic adoption of zero-hour contracts, unsocial hours and the potential for risky or exploitative working conditions. While these roles may of course suit some people, some of the time, these are certainly not working conditions conducive to human well-being, and in all likelihood are detrimental to mental health as well as being linked to the cancers that Margaret refers to, alongside obesity and increased risk of heart attack.      kateneli asks:  A key concern in both cities and suburban areas is nighttime safety. Women face heightened safety risks throughout the day, but especially at night. Darkness becomes another barrier to women in navigating urban and suburban landscapes. Many point to better street lighting as the solution, or implementing principles of safe design (such as those put forth by the organization Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design, CPTED), but is it possible to address these issues in a new way? Design plays an important role, but what about social and cultural activities - what shifts, if any, in the way we animate the nights in our cities could create a more inclusive environment where women could feel safe?          Guardian contributor     KeithFoley    24 October 2014 2:39pm  Safety at night is an issue for everyone, absolutely - and safety is the number one priority at TfL. By providing all night services on the tube, where the environment is well lit, has visible staffed, has dedicated police (British Transport Police) and extensive CCTV coverage we believe this will help those groups who may feel more vulnerable at night to travel safely and with confidence.             Guardian contributor     AndreinaSeijas    24 October 2014 2:52pm  Hello, as I mentioned in a previous comment, I agree that women are much more vulnerable than men during the night, and therefore gender is a very important factor to take into account when designing night-time policies. An interesting policy that some cities like Mexico have been implementing is incorporating &quot;Pink buses&quot; and &quot;Pink taxis&quot;, which essentially are means of transportation provided by women to other women. When riding in these pink vehicles, women report that they feel safer as they are surrounded by other working women that share their same needs and fears, and because some of them are connected to local police systems directly. However, as you said, infrastructure and design is not enough. The gender aspect of the night-time economy has a lot to do with citizen culture. Cities like Bogota have worked in this direction by establishing &quot;Women's night&quot; (la noche de las mujeres), a night of the year when men were asked to stay home with their kids so women could enjoy some time out. The objective was to condemn and raise awareness of the different forms of violence that women suffer from, particularly after 6:00 pm.             Guardian contributor     OliverSmith1    24 October 2014 3:00pm  Safety within the British NTE has been talked about constantly since the 1990s. However, even significant investment in awareness campaigns, situational crime prevention techniques, increased involvement of police and associated 'third party policing' agents is rendered ineffective against the structurally violent NTE. It is important not to forget that the British experience of the NTE is an artificial creation arising from the commercial desire of deindustrialized cities and towns to capitalize the lost revenue represented by dark, empty streets once shops and offices closed for the night. The ideological drive to eke profit from all corners of the city and its populace results in a competitive market place where bars and clubs attempt to out do each other as they vie for supremacy in a crowded marketplace. This competition is structurally violent at its very core, creating a race to the bottom for cheap drink offers, and maximization of available space, denying consumers seating or space to place drinks.  The entirely conscious and calculated interior design of pubs and clubs in the NTE ensures customers stand, tightly packed, bottle in hand, rendered effectively mute by the volume of the music, drinking and returning to the bar for another round, where the bar staff will have been primed by managers to upsell, and increase their consumption. These are the building blocks of the British binge drinking culture, an environment in which violence and sexual assault are so common-place as to often go unreported, accepted by many as a routine hazard of a big night out.  Despite widely publicized (although questionable) declining rates of violence and consumption in the NTE, the faustian pact of the 24hour city project of the 1990s/2000s has created a largely homogenized and sclerotic space devoid of much in the way of civic or organic potential for growth.         Westminster Bridge, London. Photograph: estersdr/GuardianWitness    jameswalsh says:  A massively anecdotal question from me: as someone who has done plenty of shift work in London over the past decade or so, I actually feel that the London is *less* 24 hours than it used to be, certainly in terms of opportunities to have a relaxing 3am drink, or coffee, or go to an all-night cinema or restaurant. Back in the 70s even the Wimpy bars in central London were open until the early hours. My layman\u2019s reasoning for this is that rising costs of living have pushed all but the super rich increasingly out of London - and thanks to Ken\u2019s excellent extension of the night bus network you just don\u2019t see so many people hanging out in central London as you once did. Can one of the experts on the panel dissuade me of this anecdotal notion?          Guardian contributor     WilliamStraw    24 October 2014 2:38pm  jameswalsh, your observations are very interesting. Historians write about &quot;nocturnalization&quot;, the pushing of social life and leisure deeper into the night over the last couple of centuries or so. But is nocturnalization really the case? In large parts of Montreal, foodie restaurants which close by midnight are pushing out all-night diners and music venues, mostly for the reason you identify -- increased rents.      GerardoGonzalez says:   There can be no \u201cnight spaces\u201d when all stakeholders are taken into consideration. The new deal is to create networks within the night economy. These networks include local governments - inhabitants of the areas, workers, owners of night spaces, police. One time events in the \u201cnight\u201d in latin america or elsewhere where should not be considered a part of a public policy. I believe in long term public policies that connect the city by night - such as is happening in London. Another cool example is Bogota where the city government is considering extending opening hours of many places for security reasons. It\u2019s better to leave a Disco at 5.00am (daylight) then at 3.00 am          Guardian contributor     WilliamStraw    24 October 2014 2:46pm  Geraldo, these are interesting observations. In Bogota, earlier this year, I saw both the best and worst of nightlife zones: a salsa club district in the south of the city in which the sense of safety was in direct proportion to the number of people on the streets, and a heavily patrolled and bounded bar zone in one of the richer parts of the city, which felt like a compound.                 GerardoGonzalez    24 October 2014 2:57pm  Hi William -  Both in Bogota and in Caracas what you find are &quot;night enclaves&quot; - that is a very specific zone that is &quot;protected&quot; and functions at night. The dilema here is a security problem. Caracas for example has many night enclaves that are not connected to each other - thus the night belongs to specific zones of the city but there is not interconneting zones. The challenge is to connect these zones - like you see in Paris or even Bangkok.             Guardian contributor     AndreinaSeijas    24 October 2014 2:58pm  Gerardo, I agree with you. One-time events should not be considered public policies. Long-term ones which involve infrastructural and cultural changes are the ones with the potential of real progress. However, we must understand that there are different &quot;stages&quot; in a city's preparedness to expand it's NTE, or a learning curve if you want to look at it that way.  You need both hardware--proper lighting, transportation, labor conditions, licenses--as well as software--education and citizen culture--to be in place to have a balanced NTE and night life in general. Cities have to start somewhere....      Our experts also talked to each other about the issues. Here are their thoughts on \u201ctaming the night\u201d:         Guardian contributor     WilliamStraw    24 October 2014 2:04pm  We know about all the efforts in various cities to &quot;tame&quot; the night -- nuit blanche arts festivals, alcohol-free &quot;First Night&quot; New Year's Even celebrations, book nights in Latin American cities. Is this how we want our nights to be?: respectable and uplifting?             Guardian contributor     OliverSmith1    24 October 2014 2:12pm  Possibly, but then what differentiates it from the day?! In my own research, young and not-so-young drinkers report escaping the workaday monotony of daily life, and it is this that makes the NTE so alluring. Without the excessive alcohol consumption, inherent risk, the frisson of danger, the feeling of letting go, the potential for chance meetings and unpredictable social scenarios, there would be very little to recommend it, as anyone who has found themselves sober on a revolving dance floor in an 80s theme bar will testify!             Guardian contributor     AndreinaSeijas    24 October 2014 2:13pm  I believe these efforts to &quot;tame&quot; the night are very useful to raise awareness of the relevance of this time frame from a social and economic perspective. However, in some places they are closer to a &quot;state of exception&quot; than to the rule. For instance, this is the case of many Latin American cities where crime rates and insecurity are fairly high. In my hometown Caracas, there is a very popular night-time festival called &quot;Por el Medio de la Calle&quot; (in the middle of the street) that invites citizens to walk and explore the night in Caracas for a day--something exceptional as Caracas is one of the most dangerous places in the world. This event has gathered crowds of more than 40,000 people who enjoy the possibility of &quot;taking back the night&quot;, but still it only happens once a year... the question is: why are we doing these events? what's their long-term objective?

Just as gas lamps were replaced with electric streetlights, so neons are being replaced with LEDs. And with them, the way our cities look in movies, as in real life, is morphing. Christopher Doyle\u2019s cinematography in the 1980s and 1990s for Wong Kar-Wai, including Fallen Angels and Happy Together, would look completely different had it not been for the electric glare of neon \u2013 but as cities set out to modernise lighting systems, reduce some of that city glare and cut municipal electricity bills, the films of Doyle and others will become visual archives of how our cities used to glow.  Here are five films in which a city\u2019s lights are almost a character in their own right. What have we missed? Tell us your picks (and don\u2019t say Bright Lights, Big City). Los Angeles in Collateral (2004) Cinematographers: Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron            The eerie green lighting of Los Angeles in Michael Mann\u2019s 2004 Collateral is suitably clinical. As Tom Cruise the contract killer and Jamie Foxx the hapless taxi driver move around the city, the latter coerced into the former\u2019s night-time business, that sickly hue accompanies them. Now that LA\u2019s yellow sodium streetlights have been replaced with LEDs, however, it means the end for that on-screen version of the Big Orange. Shot through HD cameras, the lights gave the film its glow \u2013 an effect Mann had actively sought in moving the shoot from New York. New York in Taxi Driver (1976) Cinematographer: Michael Chapman            Shot when Manhattan was simultaneously experiencing both a heatwave and a rubbish strike, this 1976 Scorsese film uses lighting to lead our eyes to follow those of Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle, who plots to purge the city of the peep shows, the prostitutes, the \u201canimals\u201d that come out at night \u2013 the \u201cwhores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal\u201d.  As Bickle drives through the seedy streets in his taxi, the lights of the city\u2019s adult movie theatres, bars, tunnels and diners seep through the car\u2019s windows and on to his face. The moral degradation finds him even in his cab. But as with LA, the lights of New York are undergoing a massive retrofit that will alter the look of the city and firmly entrench Taxi Driver as a particularly 20th century film. Bangkok in Only God Forgives (2013) Cinematographer: Larry Smith             The lighting in this Nicolas Winding Refn film set in Bangkok is used with so much precision that it could almost have been painted on. The Thai capital looks like a smorgasbord of sin. Inside the hotels, the Muay Thai boxing club, the bars and clubs, the lights create an atmosphere of menace and frenzy. Peter Bradshaw summed up that crimson world: \u201ca place of deep-sea unreality in which you need to breathe through special gills \u2013 and through which the action swims at about 90% of normal speed through to its chilling conclusion. It is a kind of hallucinated tragi-exploitation shocker, an enriched uranium cake of pulp with a neon sheen.\u201d Whether you agree with Bradshaw\u2019s five-star review \u2013 and many have argued that the film priorities style over substance \u2013 the lighting is undoubtedly spectacular. Tokyo in Enter the Void (2009) Cinematographer: Beno\u00eet Debie            Gaspar Noe\u2019s psychedelic headfuck of a film follows a dead drug dealer\u2019s restless spirit as it floats through (and above) a lurid Tokyo nightscape. The film sets out to shock, and the relentless strobes and graphic hallucinatory sex scenes certainly knock your socks off. But after all the throbbing beats and freaky shagging are over, it is Noe\u2019s neon reimagining of Tokyo that remains.  Vienna in The Third Man (1949) Cinematographer: Robert Krasker            No rundown of cinematic street lighting could omit Carol Reed\u2019s classic thriller. Flickering shadows follow the befuddled Holly Martins as he searches the city\u2019s postwar warrens for a witness to the death of his old friend Harry Lime \u2013 a search that takes him to some spectacularly lit sewers. It\u2019s the kind of lighting you could never replicate in the city today: The Third Man was filmed, in part, by actual Vienna lamplight. Water was reportedly poured over the city\u2019s cobblestones to achieve that sinister gleam.

The environmental campaign group \u2013 which has long been against GM foods \u2013 claims that a \u201csilent revolution\u201d in agriculture is showing a stronger track record than the GM process, which it labels as having shown disappointing results. \u201cWhilst the debate between GM and non-GM has used up most of the political oxygen, this report shows it is not the only \u2013 or indeed, the best \u2013 show in town. There is a growing range of non-GM biotechnologies which show how a growing world population can be fed at a time when natural environments are increasingly stressed,\u201d said Greenpeace chief scientist Dr Doug Parr. \u201cIt\u2019s a silent revolution, making huge strides on the ground for the world\u2019s farmers without the novel risks of GM,\u201d he said. \u201cThe debate is not about GM any more; things have moved on.\u201d However, the group has been accused of \u201cbizarre\u201d hypocrisy by several leading geneticists who point out that the same science is behind both GM and the biotechnologies Greenpeace are backing. Known as MAS \u2013 Marker Assisted Selection \u2013 they combine genetics and molecular biology to pick out and control the best traits of an individual plant. Essentially, it is using gene technology to improve what is already there rather than introducing new elements as GM does, for example in the \u201cgolden rice\u201d project which added vitamin A to rice. \u201cThis is bizarre. What they are talking about is essentially the suite of technologies that spearhead the \u2018green revolution\u2019, which eco groups such as Greenpeace have steadfastly rubbished for decades. Now they see it as agriculture\u2019s saviour,\u201d said Johnjoe McFadden, professor of molecular genetics at the University of Surrey. \u201cIf GM is not up to much then why has it been so successful that crops such as soya are now nearly all GM worldwide. Who knows best how to grow their own crops \u2013 farmers or Greenpeace? \u201cGenetic-assisted breeding is certainly very important and will help to generate new crops but it can\u2019t, for example, replace golden rice. Vitamin A-rich rice cannot be bred because it isn\u2019t a trait which already occurs in rice. This places strict limitations on this form of breeding.\u201d But Greenpeace insisted Vitamin A rice was still \u201cyears away\u201d from being ready for use and pointed to MAS successes with rice, wheat and in increasing resistence to disease to crops that are of key importance in their own small geographical areas \u2013 such as Indian millet and sorghum in Sudan. \u201cOur report shows how MAS has a much stronger track record of delivery than GM technologies on properties that genuinely help poorer families globally, yet currently receives little attention,\u201d the group said.

Its successful UK business was the cash machine that reliably paid out profits measured in the billions to bankroll expansion around the world. But that old model is irreparably broken: the supermarket giant revealed last week that group pre-tax profits for the first six months of this year were almost completely wiped out by penance for past accounting sins and the collapsing profitability of the ailing UK chain. But with the results out of the way, and the first chapter of what promises to be a long-running accounting inquiry complete, new boss Dave Lewis feels it is now safe to leave the country, at least for a couple of days, to inspect his dominion. Having grounded the company fleet of corporate jets permanently, he will join hoi polloi on a gruelling long-haul flight to the Far East. He will have a lot to think about en route: sales are falling in 80% of the countries where Tesco has stores. His first ports of call \u2013 Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea \u2013 were once the jewels in Tesco\u2019s overseas crown, but even they are struggling as political and economic pressures dent sales. Closer to home in Ireland, previously the retailer\u2019s most successful European market, sales are in freefall. Like-for-likes are down a staggering 7.3% at the last count as German discounters Aldi and Lidl and homegrown rivals such as Dunnes and Musgrave eat Tesco\u2019s breakfast, lunch and dinner. Rather than flicking through the in-flight movie channels, Lewis will need to spend his travel time coming up with a battle plan. He also needs to decide how best to raise the cash the group needs to fight a price war at home and alleviate the financial squeeze on its balance sheet. Last week\u2019s first-half results \u2013 delayed by three weeks to allow external accountants to get to the bottom of the hole in profits created by the misbooking of supplier payments \u2013 made grim reading. Pre-tax profits crashed 92% to \u00a3112m on the back of more than \u00a3500m of financial one-offs. In the UK, trading profits more than halved to \u00a3499m while in Asia they were down 17% at \u00a3260m. Summing up the picture, Lewis was frank: \u201cI think relative to the market, we\u2019ve not been as competitive as I would have liked us to be.\u201d In the UK alone, BESI Research analyst Rickin Thakrar says that although its prices have now moved into line with major rivals such as Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s, it is still 38% more expensive than Aldi. Lewis has said that everything is up for review and has thus far refused to rule out a major asset sale \u2013 or even a rights issue further down the line \u2013 to get Tesco\u2019s house in order, telling the City: \u201cWe think that there are significant opportunities for us to extract value from the business that we have \u2013 either from self-help, in terms of cost cuts, or when we review the portfolio against whatever strategy we decide.\u201d     A Tesco Lotus store in Bangkok. Photograph: Pornchai Kittiwongsakul/EPA    Analysts think Tesco\u2019s Asian arm, which includes the successful South Korean chain Home Plus, could be worth as much as \u00a39bn, but others point to less drastic solutions such as the sale of Dunnhumby, the data mining firm behind Clubcard, or hiving off smaller interests such as the Dobbies garden centre chain, to return to its roots as a straightforward supermarket group. So far Lewis has only committed to a domestic cost-cutting drive, starting with its 32 head office buildings, so it can invest more in shopfloor staff. It turns out the accounting scandal \u2013 which revealed the estimate of first-half profits Tesco gave the City back in August had been artificially inflated by \u00a3263m \u2013 was just the tip of the iceberg that the previous management team left for him to negotiate. \u201cIt all stems from the previous management team [led by Philip Clarke] \u2026 they were not brave enough to tell the City the truth,\u201d says one senior supermarket executive. \u201cThey could have gone on the record and said consumers were being hit hard and they needed to invest in the shopping trip to protect sales. It would have hit profits but would have been the right thing to do for the long term.\u201d A trip across the Irish Sea provides a frightening case study of how Tesco has taken its eye off the ball. While in the UK it has four similar rivals to contend with, in Ireland there is only one retailer of its type \u2013 Tesco itself. But it is still being outsmarted by Aldi, Lidl and domestic chains such as Musgrave\u2019s SuperValu. \u201cIn Ireland you have got the rise of the discounters and two strong local players pointing out that Tesco is a British company in trouble,\u201d says Shore Capital analyst Clive Black. \u201cAldi and Lidl are in a big groove, with a combined market share of 19% in Ireland versus 8% in the UK.\u201d Lewis will also need to check out Tesco\u2019s supermarkets in Poland and Hungary, which are also finding life tough as the discounters make their presence felt. \u201cCentral Europe has been awful for a while,\u201d says Black. \u201cThe economies are very weak and the business is hypermarket-based, which is a square peg in a round hole. \u201cThe days of Tesco being a global retailer in Leahy\u2019s vision have gone but its European and Asian businesses together are more profitable than Sainsbury\u2019s and do not require as much capital as they used to, which is an important part as to why we still think Tesco is in control of its own destiny.\u201d Last week Lewis made it clear there was no \u201cbig bang\u201d presentation on the horizon where he would set out his stall to save Tesco. PowerPoint talks give too much commercially sensitive information to rivals, he argued, although the fall in the share price suggests his secretive approach has done little so far to reassure nervous investors who have already watched the value of their shareholdings halve this year. After his first formal outing, the jury is still out on Tesco\u2019s new management team. Analysts and industry watchers say it is too soon to judge the mettle of Lewis and new finance director Alan Stewart, whose tenure can still be measured in weeks. \u201cI think you have got to give Lewis some leeway,\u201d says the supermarket insider. \u201cHe\u2019s been dealt a shit hand and has played it as well as he could.\u201d     A branch of Irish supermarket chain SuperValu in Dublin. Photograph: Sam Boal/Photocall Ireland for the Observer    CHAIRMAN WANTED: MUST ENJOY A CHALLENGE Headhunters are racing to find a replacement for Tesco chairman Sir Richard Broadbent after the former civil servant announced his resignation on Thursday. The ideal candidate would be a seasoned retailer, with exemplary boardroom skills, willing to take on what is fast becoming the mother of all turnaround challenges. He or she will work alongside Dave Lewis, the new chief executive, who has had little time to work on a new strategy for the retailer in his two months in the job since uncovering a \u00a3263m accounting scandal. One leading recruiter said: \u201cPreferably the new chairman should have retail experience, because the new chief executive doesn\u2019t. That experience could be in a non-executive context as long as they have had significant exposure to the retail market. They have also got to be highly respected in the City.\u201d So who might the headhunters place on their list? Archie Norman is the lead candidate. The 60-year-old has been chairman of ITV since 2010 and a non-executive director of Australian supermarket Coles since 2007. The consummate retailer, Norman rejuvenated Asda, sold it to Walmart, then served as Conservative MP for Tunbridge Wells for eight years. A former McKinsey management consultant, He was brought into Coles to help rejuvenate it, and may not be interested in another big turnaround job \u2013 he\u2019s already been there. Sir Ian Cheshire, outgoing boss of B&amp;Q Kingfisher, is another retailer with a track record of taking on troubled firms. During his seven years at the DIY business he cut costs, axed the dividend to preserve cash and cut back its debt. He is popular in the City, but at 55 Cheshire is thought to have his eye on another chief executive\u2019s job rather than a chairmanship. John Gildersleeve joined Tesco in 1965 aged 19, then rose through the ranks to sit on the board for 20 years before retiring in 2004. Since then he has been chairman of tobacco company Gallaher, music company EMI and fashion retailer New Look and as well as Carphone Warehouse. He is now deputy chairman of Carphone Warehouse\u2019s offshoot Talk Talk. He is thought to be keen on the Tesco job, but to some he is too controversial a figure to chair Tesco. \u201cVery outspoken\u201d was the view of one source. Richard Cousins, a newly appointed non-exec at Tesco, is already been cited as a candidate. Cousins is not a retailer, but is chief executive of giant caterer Compass, which employs 470,000 staff. He took that job in 2006 \u2013 when the business was in the mire \u2013 and would have to quit if the chairmanship did appeal. John Allan, chairman of Dixons Retail at the time of its merger with Carphone Warehouse, may also get a mention. Now deputy chairman of the enlarged retailer, he is highly rated and has sat on boards including Deutsche Post and Samsonite. Former banker and trade minister Lord (Mervyn) Davies is not a retailer, but one of the great and good who has served on the Tesco board. He wrote a government report on getting more women into the boardroom and likes big challenges.

From Siem Reap Start in Siem Reap by following our Angkor Wat holiday itinerary, which focuses on \u2018Temple Town\u2019, the springboard for exploring the Khmer empire\u2019s world heritage archaeological sites, and the surrounding area. You can get to Siem Reap by train or bus from Bangkok (allow a full day) or on a short flight from Bangkok, Singapore, Ho Chi Minh City and other Asian capitals. See our Top 10 hotels, hostels and B&amp;Bs near Angkor Wat for places to stay. Off-the-beaten-track temples     Banteay Chhmar, near Battambang. Photograph: Dennis Drenner/Alamy    If you\u2019re not \u201ctempled out\u201d, you could spend two days seeing these alluring yet little-visited temples. Prasat Preah VihearPerched spectacularly on a plateau in the Dangrek mountains, Prasat Preah Vihear (\u00a33 entry) is a sprawling, Unesco world heritage listed temple from the Angkor-era. It is 135 miles northeast from Siem Reap and straddles the Thai border. It\u2019s just about doable on a day trip, however, an overnight stay at Preah Vihear Hotel (doubles from \u00a349), 19 miles away, allows you to savour both sunset and sunrise at the site. Siem Reap-based Beyond Unique Escapes offers a tours from US$80 per person. Banteay ChhmarRemote Banteay Chhmar (\u00a33 entry), 105 miles northwest of Siem Reap, is an enjoyable detour en route to Battambang. It\u2019s worth the journey for its size \u2013 it\u2019s the fourth largest Angkorian temple \u2013 unspoilt setting, and chance to experience a homestay with a local family in a traditional Khmer house ($7 per room; meals $1-$3). See the Banteay Chhmar Tourism website for details on getting there. Battambang city and province     The \u2018bamboo train\u2019 ride at Battambang. Photograph: Geoff Moore/REX    Riverside Battambang is Cambodia\u2019s second largest city although it feels like a country town. Most visitors are here to hurtle through the rice fields on the \u201cbamboo \u2018train\u201d, known in Khmer as a norry (one hour, \u00a33), a wooden frame covered with slats of bamboo and powered by a motorbike engine that runs on a single-track railway built by the French in the 1920s. They are fun, but it\u2019s worth spending a couple of days taking in the city\u2019s architecture and arts, sampling street food, cycling to villages, and doing tuk tuk tours into the countryside to see Angkorian temples and visit cottage industries. Check into colonial-style Bambu Hotel (doubles from $90) in the centre or for a village experience try the Khmer wooden houses at Maisons Wat Kor (doubles from $94) in Wat Kor village. Battambang\u2019s protected heritage quarter is home to 800 significant buildings, including a 150-year old Chinese temple, charming shop-houses, elegant colonial French buildings, glittering pagodas and striking modernist buildings from the New Khmer Architecture movement. Battambang Bike offers architecture and art-themed cycle tours ($20) and village bike rides and also rents bicycles.     Monks outside the Maek Maek gallery, in front of sculpture by Battambang artist Mao Soviet.  Photograph: Claire Knox for the Guardian    Thanks to the 20-year old Phare Ponleau Selpak performing arts and visual arts school, which has a circus department and big top (shows Monday and Thursday 7pm, one hour, $8), there\u2019s a flourishing arts scene. Galleries and art spaces that can be browsed include Make Maek, Lotus Bar and Gallery and Sammaki on Street 2\u00bd, Studio Art Battambang on Street 1\u00bd, and BCi Battambang opposite the Royal Hotel. Battambang is Cambodia\u2019s rice bowl and boasts the country\u2019s finest food. Visit Phsar Boeung Choeuk market to see fresh local produce. Try noodles and dumplings handmade to order at Lan Chov Khorko Miteanh (145 Street 2) or dine on pan-Asian cuisine at stylish Jaan Bai (Street 2), a social enterprise restaurant and bar that trains and employs disadvantaged kids, with a menu by Asia\u2019s best chef, David Thompson of Nahm Bangkok. At sunset, stalls set up around Phsar Nath market to sell soups, curries and barbecue meats. Battambang Resort runs a fantastic snack tour (from $7) to sample street food at riverside stalls and eateries. You can hire a tuk-tuk for around \u00a39 a day, or \u00a36 half a day, and take an excursion into the lush countryside to see artisanal producers make incense, cotton kramas (traditional Cambodian checked scarves), rice paper, noodles, and rice wine. En route visit Angkorian-era temples such as crowd-free Ek Phnom and Wat Banan, and Mount Sampeau, site of the Killing Caves, where the Khmer Rouge dumped its victims bodies; at dusk watch millions of bats emerge for a cave. Asia-based Backyard Travel has a three-day Beyond Angkor: Battambang and its Countryside tour, taking in many of these experiences, which departs from Siem Reap and costs $469pp all-inclusive. Phnom Penh From Battambang, there are some 20 buses a day to Phnom Penh (six hours, longer during the monsoon, about \u00a34). Use our Phnom Penh in three days holiday itinerary to make the most of your time in the cosmopolitan capital, and our Top 10 hotels, hostels and B&amp;Bs in Phnom Penh for our recommendations for where to stay. Rivers, forests and mountains     Traditional fishing methods at Kompong Cham on the Mekong river. Photograph: Look, die Bildagentur der Fotografen/Alamy    The cooler eastern provinces of Mondulkiri and Ratanakiri are home to lazy rivers, rubber plantations, rolling hills, forested mountains, impressive waterfalls and endangered wildlife. Kompong Cham and KratieThe provincial capital, Kompong Cham, is on the Mekong and 75 miles northeast of Phnom Penh, is an easy bus ride (2\u00bd hours, around \u00a33) from the capital. It makes for a relaxing stop for a riverside walk, a bike ride over a bamboo bridge to Koh Paen island, or a sunset cruise (\u00a36). Most travellers make a beeline for Kratie by bus (three hours from Kompong Cham, \u00a33; five hours from Phnom Penh, \u00a37), also located on the Mekong. Stay at friendly Le Tonl\u00e9 Tourism Training Center (doubles from $10) in Kratie, which trains underprivileged youths, or a traditional Khmer timber house at Rajabori Villas (doubles from $60) on idyllic Koh Trong island, home to a Vietnamese floating village. Rich in French colonial architecture, Kratie is a pleasant place to kick back. The main attraction, however, is the endangered freshwater Irrawaddy dolphins that can be seen 10 miles north of town. Take a moto (\u00a33) or remork (\u00a36), then a boat (\u00a35). Stung Treng and Ban LungTwo and a half hours from Kratie by bus, Stung Treng is another laidback riverside town that makes a good base for seeing the Irrawaddy dolphins from the villages of O\u2019Svay and Preah Rumkel, where wetlands are rich in birdlife. A further two and half hours away by bus, Ban Lung is a base for various activities, including kayaking, mountain biking, trekking in Virachey national park to see some of Cambodia\u2019s last remaining virgin forest, visits to ethnic minority villages, and swimming at Boeng Yeak Lom, a vivid blue crater lake. You can walk through the forest with elephants at the Elephant Valley Project  (full day $85, including transport and lunch), which adopts mistreated Asian elephants, or do an overnight trek to see wild, rare northern yellow-cheeked gibbons in the Veun Sai-Pang Conservation Area with  from \u00a3$199 per person. Set in luxuriant gardens, lakeside Terres Rouges Lodge (doubles from $58) is furnished with Cambodian antiques; while budget-friendly Treetop Ecolodge (doubles $12) has rustic bungalows and sweeping valley vistas. The Vietnam border is two hours by mini-bus from Ban Lung ,or it\u2019s an 11-hour bus ride back to Phnom Penh. Beaches and islands     The island of Koh Rong, southern Cambodia. Photograph: Jack Malipan Travel Photography/Alamy    Cambodia\u2019s sleepy south coast is skirted by pristine sandy beaches shaded by coconut palms and casuarinas, while off shore there are blissfully undeveloped islands. See our Top 10 beach hotels and bungalows in Cambodia for places to stay, from stylish resorts to rustic bungalows. Sihanoukville and islandsFour hours from Phnom Penh by bus, Sihanoukville is the largest and most developed town, which is why you should make a beeline for Ream national park, 10 miles east, for jungle walks, mountain treks, mango cruises, birdwatching, dolphin spotting (from December to April), and snorkelling on the islands of Koh Thmei and Koh Seh. Of Sihanoukville\u2019s beaches, busy Occheuteal boasts laidback bars; Serendipity is more mellow and romantic, though transforms into party central at night; and Otres is the most relaxed. If you\u2019re looking to do more than work on your tan, there\u2019s sailing, diving, snorkelling, kitesurfing, windsurfing, kayaking, paddle boarding, and surfing (Otres, from May to October). Kampot and Kep From Sihanoukville, mini buses regularly trundle east to atmospheric riverside Kampot (1\u00bd hours), best known for producing the world\u2019s best pepper. In the old French Quarter, check into La Java Bleue (doubles from $55) in a colonial building with balconies; Rikitkitavi (doubles from $48) in a renovated barn on River Road; or The Columns (doubles from $45) in a row of charming shop-houses. After taking in the colonial architecture and ambling along the waterfront, take an excursion to Bokor national park and its eerie abandoned French hill station (entry \u00a39, tours from \u00a315), cave temples in the limestone hills of Phnom Chhnork and Phnom Sorsia, and a pepper farm. Starling Farm, an organic pepper plantation, has beautiful wooden villas and bungalows at their new Starling Ridge Plantation Resort http://starlingridge.com (from $30) . With little else to do other than soak up the sun and feast on fresh seafood at the crab market, seaside Kep, on a peninsula 45 minutes from Kampot, is the perfect spot to end a trip to Cambodia. A retreat for French colonials in the early 20th century and a playground for Cambodia\u2019s royalty and rich in the 1960s, the area is dotted with faded shells of modernist villas, abandoned when the Khmer Rouge arrived. Offshore, Koh Tonsay or Rabbit Island (25 minutes; public boat from \u00a38, private boat from \u00a318) has empty beaches and excellent snorkelling. Inland, lofty Kep national park has trails to hike and bike. If a hillside resort with pool and panoramic ocean views appeals, try the highest, Le Bout du Monde (doubles from $45), which has stone and timber Khmer-style villas with verandas and hammocks, while The Vine Retreat (doubles from $35), an on organic farm, offers yoga, meditation, free bicycles and tours to a weaving centre. Back down by the water, don\u2019t miss sundowners overlooking the sea at the Sailing Club. From Kep, there are buses to the Vietnamese border and the riverside town of Ha Tien (1\u00bd hours), part of a special economic zone, allowing visa-free travel for 15 days. If you want to ventrue further into Vietnam you need to return to Phonm Penh (buses to Ho Chi Minh Cit, five hours, \u00a310). .", "publicationDate": "2014-10-28T05:59:03Z", "tags": ["Cambodia holidays", "Backpacking holidays", "Asia", "Travel", "Road trips", "Adventure travel", "Budget travel"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/oct/28/-sp-cambodia-tour-two-weeks-holiday-itinerary", "title": "Cambodia in two weeks: holiday itinerary\r\n\r\n\r\n", "sentences": ["You can get to Siem Reap by train or bus from Bangkok (allow a full day) or on a short flight from Bangkok, Singapore, Ho Chi Minh City and other Asian capitals.", "Try noodles and dumplings handmade to order at Lan Chov Khorko Miteanh (145 Street 2) or dine on pan-Asian cuisine at stylish Jaan Bai (Street 2), a social enterprise restaurant and bar that trains and employs disadvantaged kids, with a menu by Asia\u2019s best chef, David Thompson of Nahm Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Mandeep Singh Tiwana, head of policy and research, Civicus, Johannesburg, South Africa, @CIVICUSalliance Work for people, not governments: We need to move away from the state-centric model of international governance towards a citizen-oriented model. Radical new forms of representation should be explored, such as citizens\u2019 panels.  Use technology to increase connectivity and transparency: New media, including mobile and social media, could help demystify international institutions and encourage participation. Alongside this, there could be more regular interactions by the leadership of intergovernmental organisations with civil society and the media, and the creation of accessible databases of statistical and other information on their work. Saket Mani, UN children and youth representative, World We Want 2015, Pune, India, @SaketMANI Take surveys: Join the biggest ever open/transparent survey called UN My World Survey 2015 which, through creative online and offline methods, allows people across the world to tell the United Nations the most important issues they would like the post-2015 agenda to address.  Another one is the World We Want 2015, which enables people to engage, visualise and analyse people\u2019s voices on sustainable development.  Use post-2015 as an opportunity for reform: In the drawn-out discussions on a post-2015 UN development agenda, the focus is on \u201cthe world we want,\u201d but not yet on \u201cthe UN we want\u201d. The current UN development system is far from having the operational mechanisms that the world needs.  Adam Malczak, head of outreach programmes, London International Model UN, London, UK, @Adam_Malczak Start a PR campaign: The UN could do more to promote itself. It is vital people see the real work the UN is doing, beyond the power struggles within the security council. Carry out an audit: As with any organisation, the UN could use some audits and reviews of its structure, administration and in particular the terms of employment for desk jobs. But for most of it, these are very hard-working people, doing everything they can in difficult circumstances, with enormous help from UN Volunteers. Samy Tshimanga, columnist, Dunia, Indianapolis, USA,  @La_General_ Include all countries: There needs to be more African representation sitting at the table. I was just doing some research the other day and I found a list of youth delegates at the UN and my country [Democratic Republic of Congo] was not listed. Where is the balance? Where is the diversity? Francesco Mancini, senior adviser, International Peace Institute, Singapore, @ManciniFr Balance the power: On the UN security council, it is necessary to find a more balanced regional representation. But we need to avoid increasing the number of members too much. The risk is we end up with a very indecisive council, even more than now. De-centralise the structure: The UN cannot ask the field to integrate more until the headquarters integrate. Ideally, I would be in favor of merging the department of political affairs with the department of peacekeeping operations. Country desks should be integrated too. For example, those who work on Haiti should all be part of the same team and respond to the same boss. Olav Kjorven, Director, Public Partnerships Division, Unicef, New York, USA, @olavkjorven Show leadership on human rights: The current picture on human rights is deeply worrying. There is an erosion of commitment to these most sacrosanct of UN norms. There are only two ways forward on this: either we have to go through another period of darkness to rediscover their essential necessity or we will see some real leadership emerge capable of rebuilding resolve. In this regard we should expect more from leaders of the large democracies. Reform financing: The UN is there to deliver global public goods. The future financing of the UN should reflect this. We need a system where all countries contribute, according to their capabilities and responsibilities, based on specific criteria that reflect levels of economic development and population. It is ridiculous that a handful of small countries in northern Europe continue to bankroll the UN (or a large share of it) on behalf of the rest of the world. Phil Robertson, deputy director, Asia division, Human Rights Watch, Bangkok, Thailand, @Reaproy Allocate more resources to human rights: There needs to be more resources put into the Office of the High Commission for Human Rights (OHCHR) because they are very stretched thin now. The OHCHR needs to be empowered with support from the secretary general, and have the tools to respond to rights crises as they occur.  Vary the veto: The big issue at the UN security council is not the number of members, it\u2019s that the five permanent members still have the veto. It\u2019s the veto authority that needs to be either reformed or done away with. Perhaps if there was a larger group of permanent members, and the veto requirement was not just one member vetoing, but say three members vetoing? The key is that one or two states should not be able to stop urgent actions in a place like Syria. Janos Pasztor, executive director of conservation, WWF International, Geneva, Switzerland, @jpasztor Be realistic about salaries: The UN, like any other organisation working in this area, needs to be able to attract talent in a competitive market, to address the extremely difficult issues of extreme poverty, often in dangerous and difficult situations. The \u201cexcessive\u201d UN salaries are no more excessive than those of other organisations working in this area. Stephanie Mbida, executive director, KickLoans, New York City, USA, @StephanieMbida Cut costs, foster creativity: The UN should focus on cutting expenses through technology and innovation, heightening transparency so that the public knows the great work they have been doing.

They had to get up early each morning and go for long marches, through paddy fields with what Ponu, who has died aged 89, recalled were \u201cgigantic leeches\u201d. Chandra Bose promised their families that he would look after the young girls as though they were his daughters. After some months they had to retreat, losing several of their friends from heavy bombing by the British. By train, foot and lorry, they arrived in Bangkok, where Rasammah fell ill. Ponu stayed with her in the French convent there until they were both flown back to Penang, Malaya, by British military plane. After a debriefing in the Eastern and Oriental hotel that she described as \u201cvery polite\u201d, the British authorities let the young women return home. Ponu was born in Ipoh, in what was then British Malaya, to a family of second-generation migrants from Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), with a strong sense of Indian national identity. When her teacher once asked all the Indian girls in the class to stand up, Ponu also stood, glaring fiercely at anyone who challenged her, saying, \u201cYes, I am Indian.\u201d Her father died when she was 10, leaving her mother to raise six children on her own. In the 50s and 60s Ponu played hockey for the Selangor state and the national women\u2019s teams, travelling extensively on tour. Ponu met my parents as a worshipper at St John\u2019s Church, Ipoh, where my father was an Anglican priest. They immediately took to this strong and strikingly beautiful woman, a spirited and outspoken individual, with her naughty humour and raucous laughter, who refused to be constrained by the traditional roles ascribed to women at the time. Ponu married, settled in Ipoh, and had a daughter, Pia. But when the marriage ended, she took a job as a typist in Kuala Lumpur until she retired and then went to live with Pia and her family in the US. She is survived by Pia, her grandchildren, Adrian and Pia, and by Rasammah.", "publicationDate": "2014-10-28T15:43:02Z", "tags": ["India", "Sri Lanka", "Malaysia", "Asia Pacific"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/28/ponu-navarednam-obituary", "title": "Ponu Navarednam obituary", "sentences": ["By train, foot and lorry, they arrived in Bangkok, where Rasammah fell ill.

He gave me Bruce Robinson\u2019s script, which was enormous, but it was so full of passion and energy I couldn\u2019t put it down. I\u2019d heard about Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge, but didn\u2019t know much until I read it. I wrote to David saying that whoever made the film would have to be careful because it wasn\u2019t just a war story: it was about human connection, how friendships are born and what they do to us. I didn\u2019t hear from him for six months, then we bumped into one another and he said he\u2019d interviewed most of the directors in the world \u2013 including some very big names who would make the studios happy \u2013 but no one had really understood it. \u201cYou\u2019re the only man who has,\u201d he said. I\u2019d done a lot of TV and theatre, but this was my first film and I was working with some highly experienced people: the cinematographer Chris Menges and the production designer Roy Walker, who had worked with Stanley Kubrick. The killing fields were where the Khmer Rouge executed people and dumped their bodies. We shot those scenes in the countryside outside Bangkok. Lots of very realistic looking corpses had been laid out. It was all very disturbing: you\u2019d get a crawling feeling up your back during shooting. And there was a real panic when a farmer\u2019s wife went out early in the morning and got a total shock when she saw them, poor woman. Haing S Ngor, who played Dith Pran, was an extraordinary person, tormented and confused, but warm and friendly. He\u2019d lived through all these events in Cambodia, but he was a doctor not an actor. He\u2019d managed to escape and was now working in Long Beach, California. Pat Golden, who worked on casting, said: \u201cYou should look at this man Haing, he\u2019s really interesting.\u201d When we talked, Haing vividly told me about his experiences and I thought, \u201cHmm, there\u2019s an actor in here.\u201d I got him to talk through what had happened when he was in the operating theatre and had seen the Khmer Rouge approaching. I asked him to pretend Pat was the nurse and repeat exactly what he\u2019d said. \u201cKhmer Rouge are coming!\u201d he said. \u201cWe must go! I\u2019m telling you \u2013 GO!\u201d Then he burst into tears. \u201cHaing,\u201d I said, \u201cyou have to do this film. There is a voice for Cambodia and you are that voice. It\u2019s your duty to bring it to the world.\u201d It was quite a horrible, manipulative thing to say. During shooting, I would sometimes crawl below the camera and call out to him: \u201cRemember how you felt!\u201d He was such a brave man. At the wrap party, everyone came in costume and he came dressed as Khmer Rouge. He had the courage to face his demons. Julian Sands, actor Roland\u2019s audition process was extraordinary. I was 24 and I\u2019ve never come across anything as rigorous since. He was looking to put together a troupe of actors without much film experience, because he wanted the freshness of everything to resonate with us. He would gather lots of us in his office to improvise scenes. After about a month, he had a group he found interesting. John Malkovich, Sam Waterston and Haing S Ngor weren\u2019t subject to that, but their meetings with him were still pretty intense. A lot was made of the fact that Haing hadn\u2019t acted before, but John put it differently: he said Haing had been acting his whole life \u2013 you had to be a pretty good actor to survive the Khmer Rouge. I spent some time with Jon Swain, the journalist I was playing. He was in Bangkok, taking photographs of me taking photographs as him. John, Sam, Haing and I had arrived in Thailand a month before shooting to acclimatise. We visited a Cambodian refugee camp and talked with survivors. Atmospherically, intellectually and culturally, we were marinated. I\u2019d been cautioned by Roland to keep my distance from John because he was an unstable character. And John had been told by Roland to stay away from me, because I was a refined, sensible person who didn\u2019t want to be distracted. In fact, we bonded instantly. We were always quoting and misquoting Pinter to one another. One of the reasons the film worked so well was Bruce\u2019s solid screenplay, which was based on Sydney Schanberg\u2019s Pulitzer-prize-winning journalism. And Roland had tremendous willpower. I\u2019ve been on films half as big that have fallen apart, but somehow he kept it all together. \u2022 The 30th anniversary edition of The Killing Fields is out now on Blu-ray.", "publicationDate": "2014-11-10T16:32:17Z", "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/nov/10/how-we-made-the-killing-fields-roland-joffe-julian-sands", "title": "Roland Joffe and Julian Sands: how we made The Killing Fields", "sentences": ["We shot those scenes in the countryside outside Bangkok.", "He was in Bangkok, taking photographs of me taking photographs as him."]}, {"article": "The ABC\u2019s 11 foreign bureaux will be hit hard by the Coalition\u2019s budget cuts, with plans to scale back the Tokyo, Bangkok, New Delhi and New Zealand offices. The move is expected to save the ABC\u2019s news budget several million dollars by cutting about 20 international jobs including camera operators, producers and local fixers. The communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, is expected to announce the scale of funding cuts to the ABC and the SBS soon, with the ABC likely to lose as much as $50m a year.  Turnbull said on Tuesday he had agreed the size of the cuts. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to a conclusion on the level of cuts, yes, and the management of both companies are aware of that and the nature of those cuts will be public before too long,\u201d Turnbull told ABC radio. Turnbull indicated in September the cuts to the ABC would be as much as $200m. He said the broadcaster could cut its budget by that much and still maintain a quality service, making changes to so-called \u201cback-office\u201d functions only. But the ABC\u2019s managing director, Mark Scott, disagreed and there are plans to make significant cuts to TV and radio services. As well as axing the local Friday editions of 7.30 and moving Lateline to News 24 with less resources, the expensive network of foreign correspondents will be targeted. At the heart of the plan is the creation of four foreign correspondent \u201chubs\u201d in Washington, London, Jakarta and Beijing that would cover a wider area with journalists and camera crews flying in and out of hot spots. Sources said the restructure would save on the significant expense of employing a fully-staffed reporting team of journalists, camera operators and producers in Tokyo, Bangkok, New Delhi and New Zealand. The regions would be covered instead by video journalists working from home rather than an established bureau. The future of the Middle East bureau, which has two reporters and a camera operator covering Jerusalem and Beirut, is also under review. But the ability of ABC News to cover major events such as the 2011 tsunami in Japan or the recent political upheaval in Bangkok would be severely diminished, former correspondents have warned. \u201cThe ABC has a strategic advantage in international affairs at a time when the commercial networks are only covering Hollywood,\u201d one former foreign correspondent told Guardian Australia.  \u201cIt seems idiotic to downgrade the role of the cameramen in Bangkok and Tokyo when they are an absolutely essential element of the coverage. \u201cWe\u2019ve used a cameraman in Bangkok for years. Without him we would have been in danger in such a volatile area. He is a lifesaver. To think that we might move to a model where we would have to survive without him is horrendous.\u201d In recent years the then-Tokyo correspondent, Mark Willacy, and his camera crew and producers were on the ground to cover the earthquake and tsunami, and subsequent nuclear meltdowns at Fukushima. One source said his unrivalled coverage could not be matched by a video journalist working alone. There are fears the popular TV program Foreign Correspondent, already cut to 30 weeks a year, may be scaled back again to just 26. Foreign Correspondent is served by the ABC\u2019s network of correspondents posted overseas as well as two based in Sydney. It is the second time the ABC has attempted to scale back its international coverage. In 2011 most of the recommendations of a two-year review of the ABC\u2019s international operations were abandoned following protests from former foreign correspondents, including Lateline host Tony Jones and the now-retired Peter Cave.

If he had lost to the off-key Canadian, his season was over but he played with the required intensity in front of a loud, sell-out crowd. Federer, who beat Raonic handily on Sunday and has already qualified for the semi-finals, looked superb on Tuesday in a straight-sets win over Japan\u2019s Kei Nishikori, who had beaten a lacklustre Murray in the tournament\u2019s opening match. Nishikori plays Raonic , so Murray will go into his contest knowing what he has to do. \u201cFor me it depends on the winner of the Nishikori/Raonic match,\u201d said the Scot. \u201cIf Kei wins, then I need to beat Roger, it depends on the scoreline of that match with Kei and Raonic. If Raonic wins, then I know that all I need to do is win the match against Roger and I\u2019ll be through. I\u2019m not going to know that until I get ready for the match because I can\u2019t predict the future.\u201d This will be the 23rd meeting between Murray and Federer over 10 years and in the head-to-head they each have 11 wins apiece. \u201cI played him in my first ever final in Bangkok,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIt was a great experience then, as it has been every time I\u2019ve played against him. \u201c They are matches I\u2019ll look back on when I finish playing. They\u2019re the matches that I really remember, playing against the top guys in the big events.\u201d Murray, energised by the fans and playing in front of his mother, Judy, as well as her Strictly Come Dancing partner, Anton Du Beke, was aided by some dreadful serving and loose groundstrokes by his opponent. Raonic\u2019s first-shot accuracy dipped as low as 38% in the first set. \u201cTo be frank, my first-serve percentage shouldn\u2019t have been above 40%,\u201d he said. \u201cI started hitting serves 115 miles an hour to get it past 50%.\u201d he said. His forehand was even worse, unforced errors on that wing handing Murray 23 of the 128 points contested. \u201cI thought he played well,\u201d Raonic said, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t do my job.\u201d Statistics aside, Murray deserved his win and is in considerably better shape to face Federer \u2013 although, given the complicated format, he could lose and still go through, or win and be eliminated, depending on the result and score from the afternoon match between Nishikori and Raonic.", "publicationDate": "2014-11-12T00:49:17Z", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Roger Federer", "ATP World Tour Finals", "Tennis", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/12/andy-murray-roger-federer-atp-world-finals", "title": "Andy Murray: matches against Roger Federer are ones I look forward to", "sentences": ["\u201cI played him in my first ever final in Bangkok,\u201d Murray said."]}, {"article": "When Sergiy Stakhovsky shocked Roger Federer in the first week at Wimbledon last year, he observed later: \u201cYou\u2019re playing the guy and then you\u2019re playing the legend.\u201d Andy Murray has played both of those entities for nearly 10 years now and it is to his towering credit that they stand level at 11 wins apiece \u2013 but he knows that when they step on to the court at the O2 Arena in Greenwich on Thursday for their 23rd encounter, he will still have two players to beat, the real Federer, 33 years old but still formidable, hitting searing forehands and pinpoint serves at him, and the one trapped in the loving gaze of his fanatically loyal fans. It must hurt \u2013 although Murray says not \u2013 that his home crowd will more than likely be leaning towards the Swiss in the concluding group match of the ATP World Tour Finals. They did so in the semi-finals in 2012, only a few months after Murray had beaten Federer to win Olympic gold at Wimbledon. They do it everywhere \u2013 and not just to Murray. Federer remains a god to millions of tennis fans, and that will never change. All week Murray has made a point of acknowledging the support of the crowd. It was muted during his underdone performance in losing to Kei Nishikori on Sunday and considerably more vocal when he lifted his game to beat Milos Raonic on Tuesday, keeping alive his tournament hopes here. He appreciated it. And after practice on Wednesday, he mentioned it again on Facebook. \u201cIt can be [a factor],\u201d he said on Wednesday night, \u201cbut it is not the number one factor. The number one factor is what is going on out on the tennis court. I have always said, in all sports, if you have the crowd with you it helps. I am sure the crowd will be fairly split. They have been when I have played Roger in London before. He always gets great support wherever he goes.\u201d The one place Murray did win the crowd over was in that Olympic final. \u201cThe atmosphere was amazing,\u201d he enthused. \u201cI have obviously played a lot of matches at Wimbledon but I have never experienced Centre Court being like that.\u201d As for his relationship with Federer, it is on a par with the one he has with Novak Djokovic: they are \u201cprofessional friends\u201d. Given the amount of times they go head to head it could hardly be otherwise. Murray says it has not changed a lot over the years. \u201cNot really. I always chat to him when I see him. I haven\u2019t spent loads of time with him. We never practise together but I have always chatted to him when I have seen him. We have never had any issues away from the court.\u201d On the court they are the fiercest of competitors, Federer the controlled maestro, Murray living much closer to the edge of his emotions. It has been a classic face-off since their first match, a final in Bangkok in 2005, when Federer edged it straight sets. That is history already recorded; there is plenty more to be made here this week and in the future. The conundrum for Murray, however, is the mathematics of this crazily complicated tournament. It is perfectly possible \u2013 although highly unlikely \u2013 that he could beat Federer and not go through, and lose to him and qualify. Much depends on the afternoon match between Raonic and Nishikori. It would seem Murray has the advantage in playing in the evening and knowing exactly what he needs to do, by way of points. He is not sure it matters. \u201cIt can work both ways,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you play first you don\u2019t have to worry about the other match. You just concentrate on your own and then wait and see. But if you are second it can be a difficult position if you are going in thinking: all I have to is win a set. That doesn\u2019t help. I was in the position against [Jo-Wilfried] Tsonga a couple of years ago and it wasn\u2019t that easy to prepare for the match like that either. \u201cSo, for me, I just know I have to try and beat Roger. That is the mentality you want to go in with. Look, everyone knows in these events what is going on. You follow all of the results. It is not like in a slam where there are 64 matches or whatever. There is only one match that day, I will know what I have to do when I go on the court.\u201d Can he do it? Of course. As good a season as Federer has had, and as ordinary a time of it Murray has had in 2014, there is not much between them. Federer has sparkled lately, Murray has grinded \u2013 but he lit up his season with three courageous wins to make the cut.

They have about five songs \u201con the workbench\u201d so far. Despite Bar\u00e2t and Doherty\u2019s initial work, recording the Libertines\u2019 third album is unlikely to begin until the band\u2019s frontman leaves rehab. This delay will at least give the band time to find a producer: Jack White recently rejected Doherty\u2019s claim that he would helm their third LP, and Mick Jones, who produced their earlier records, told NME he \u201cprobably\u201d won\u2019t be doing it either. \u201cThe Libertines don\u2019t need me anyway,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey\u2019re such a great band that any producer will get good music from them.\u201d The Libertines\u2019 last, self-titled album came out in 2004.", "publicationDate": "2014-11-13T07:19:23Z", "tags": ["The Libertines", "Pete Doherty", "Pop and rock", "Indie", "Music", "Culture", "Drugs", "Thailand"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/13/pete-doherty-returns-to-thai-rehab-centre", "title": "Pete Doherty returns to Thai rehab centre", "sentences": ["According to a statement provided to NME, Hope Rehab boss Simon Mott convinced Doherty to come to his centre outside Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Just before the first wave hit, Edie Fassnidge took a picture of her younger sister Alice and their mother. The scene was idyllic, Boxing Day 2004, the three of them kayaking off Ao Nang beach in Thailand with Fassnidge\u2019s boyfriend, Matt: blue skies, clear waters, perfectly calm weather. \u201cI remember saying, \u2018It\u2019s so beautiful here,\u2019\u201d Fassnidge says. \u201cWe were floating along in the sea, and there was a dramatic limestone column right by us, a little island in the background, and we were all really happy.\u201d The camera was still aloft when something in the air shifted. Fassnidge\u2019s mood switched to high alert. \u201cI caught sight of the horizon and suddenly that didn\u2019t look right. Everything had been so calm and now there was a ridge all the way along it.\u201d A wave was approaching them \u2013 her mother and Alice in one kayak, she and Matt in the other. They were a kilometre from the nearest beach, but only a few metres from a rocky, vertical cliff. \u201cMy mind was going crazy, trying to make sense of what I was seeing.\u201d Fassnidge noticed her mother and Alice paddling towards the rocks and shouted at them to stop, before water engulfed them all. She was pulled from her boat, into a bank of rocks, her head pounding against them, over and over. Her mother and sister were swept away. Fassnidge\u2019s experience in the Asian tsunami would leave her bereft, and with flesh torn so badly, she could see through to her bones. It\u2019s an experience she describes in her book Rinse, Spin, Repeat. Fassnidge is now 35, and tells her story with thoughtful deliberation. It\u2019s hard to imagine she was ever so physically broken: she has the glow of someone who turned to running for therapy, takes part in triathlons, works part-time as a personal trainer, and whose Twitter bio notes, slightly astonishingly, how much she loves to swim outside. She has always been comfortable talking about what happened, she says, and at the start of 2013 the urge to tell her story became pressing. In June last year, she gave up her job and started work on a memoir; after writing for six weeks, getting everything swiftly on paper, she reread it and was disappointed to find it felt flat. Not long afterwards, she began sketching, and soon she realised that this was the answer. The pictures in her book are simple, but strangely affecting; some frames come as a punch to the gut. When I tell her this, she says creating it was very emotional, too. \u201cIt felt like I was covered in snow, buried really, really deep, but I knew there was a way out and that if I just kept drawing I would be able to emerge again.\u201d In September 2004, when she and Matt set off on their 18-month dream trip, Fassnidge was in her mid-20s, working as a sociology teacher in London. The couple had been together since their second year at Durham University, and they had always talked about travelling. They saved and planned excitedly throughout that year, deciding they would start with six months in south-east Asia, followed by a year living and working in New Zealand. She had grown up in the Yorkshire Dales, where her mother became a professor at the University of Leeds, while her father worked in arts management. The whole family was very close, she says, and remained so after her parents divorced when she was in her mid-teens. They were all musical \u2013 Fassnidge played the violin \u2013 but she says it was Alice, who played the cello, who was really gifted. In 2004, Alice was living in London, too, training to be a secondary school music teacher, and they would meet up most weeks; Alice would sometimes cut her sister\u2019s hair. One of Fassnidge\u2019s few concerns about her trip was leaving her family behind for so long, but on a visit home that summer, her mother said she and Alice could come and see them in Thailand at Christmas, which put her worries to rest.     Edie Fassnidge with her mother, sister and boyfriend in Thailand. Photograph: Courtesy Edie Fassnidge/guardian.co.uk    She and Matt set off for the trip of their lives, seeing orangutans in Borneo, climbing Mount Kilimanjaro and developing their palate for spicy food. When Alice and her mother joined them in December, Fassnidge planned an itinerary of temples, restaurants, museums and markets. The idea was to go kayaking on Christmas Day, but all the other tourists had apparently had the same thought and the boats were booked out. It would be a Boxing Day treat instead. Then the waves came. After that first one, Fassnidge tumbled underwater until everything calmed around her. When she regained some control of her body, she kicked up and found she was trapped beneath a wall of solid rock; as she felt her way along, she started panicking, deeply aware of her lack of oxygen. Finally, her hand reached into clear water and she rose up through the blue. At the surface, she saw Matt, Alice and her mother a few metres away, all treading water. \u201cI was so happy \u2013 so, so happy \u2013 and I was about to say to everyone, \u2018It\u2019s all fine!\u2019 when I realised they didn\u2019t look fine, any of them. They all looked very, very distant, just staring, not saying anything.\u201d A couple of seconds later she watched, appalled, as another wave rose behind them. She was pulled under again, and emerged to find her family had disappeared. As she swam around looking for some sign of them, another wave hit, and when she broke the surface for the third time, she saw her mother\u2019s body five metres away in the water. \u201cI swam over to her and she was face down. I turned her over and knew she was dead, but I wanted to see if I could bring her back to life, so I breathed into her mouth. I had hold of her, and my back to the sea, but I sensed something else.\u201d Another wave. \u201cI knew my mum was dead and that if I stayed in the water, I could die, too.\u201d Fassnidge swam to some nearby rocks, pulled herself out and scrambled as high as she could, holding on to rushes as the waves crashed around her. \u201cWhen the water died down, I looked to see whether my mum was there, and her body had gone. Then I looked down at myself and I was speechless. I couldn\u2019t feel any pain, but where the rocks had torn me, I was covered everywhere with lacerations and cuts. It was the strangest experience, because I thought that when people looked like I looked, they screamed, but I was just completely numb.\u201d Alone on the rocks, she considered her chances of being rescued. At that stage, she had no idea of the scale of what had just happened \u2013 she assumed the tsunami had just been a freak, local wave and that a search party would be along soon. But she also realised that she was very isolated. There was no way to dry land except via the sea, and since she was now terrified of the water, she started climbing up the rocky headland. \u201cBefore long I was climbing through really dense, spiky gorse bushes, pulling myself up through branches; I could feel myself getting cut even more. It was getting steeper and steeper, and I realised that it wasn\u2019t going to work. I needed to turn back and preserve my energy.\u201d On climbing down, she was suddenly surrounded by large, orangey-brown ants. \u201cI felt them first in my feet, which were really cut up; it was as if something was biting into the core of my body, electric pain, like an electric shock, and they swarmed all over me.\u201d There were too many to pick off, and this was the first time that she cried. \u201cI got really angry and I screamed, \u2018Why is this happening to me?\u2019\u201d She moved down to the water, heard a helicopter, and motioned to it, shouting. It was flying low, but didn\u2019t slow down, just kept moving on out to sea. There was no option but to follow it, to do what she was dreading: she lowered herself back into the water. Fassnidge swam against the currents, then rested, aware of how close she might be to dying if she didn\u2019t get help. \u201cI was feeling drained and out of energy, out of ideas. I lay down and gave myself a bit of a talking to, told myself that if I didn\u2019t do anything, I could die.\u201d Finally she saw a small gap between some rocks and decided to squeeze through. She emerged on to a small, rocky beach. After so long without water she knew she was running solely on adrenaline, but she crawled, walked and paddled as far as she could, finally turning a corner and seeing two men next to some boats. A paramedic arrived and she was carried to a beach; she hadn\u2019t spoken for hours, but her story began tumbling out.     Edie\u2019s mother and sister Alice. Photograph: Courtesy Edie Fassnidge/guardian.co.uk    The men who were looking after her mentioned that someone fitting Matt\u2019s description had been found, but she refused to let herself believe it. \u201cI\u2019d lost so much, and I think actually, in those hours on my own, I had mentally prepared myself for the possibility that I was the only one who had survived. I felt ready for that, and I had seen my mum in the water, so I knew that was quite possible. But then, not long afterwards, he came on to the beach, and it was him.\u201d Relief wells in her voice. Matt had head injuries and cuts, but was able to walk; the pair were taken to Krabi hospital and Fassnidge began grappling with the disappearance of her mother and sister. In those first exhausted hours, while her wounds were being assessed (one was infected and needed an operation), she struggled to engage emotionally with what had happened. \u201cIt felt as if I was almost willing myself to be upset, to cry, to feel grief, to feel the tremendous sadness that I knew the situation warranted. I was physically and emotionally incapable of those kinds of feelings. I just couldn\u2019t do it. I was almost trying to make myself sad by telling myself, \u2018This means that you haven\u2019t got a mum, ever.\u2019 I knew that. I understood it. I couldn\u2019t connect with it.\u201d That first night in hospital, she was lying on her back, very uncomfortable but not strong enough to move on to her side. Suddenly she felt Alice\u2019s presence beside her, a hand placed on her hip, helping her to turn. \u201cI had never experienced anything like that, and I didn\u2019t consciously will it to happen, but it was a very specific feeling \u2013 there was almost the smell of her as well \u2013 and it lasted only a few seconds.\u201d Through those early days, she wished and willed for Alice to be alive, but that moment was a quiet, private confirmation that her sister was unlikely to be coming back. The physical repercussions continued. After a few days, Fassnidge was moved to Bangkok hospital and started to experience terrible, unexplained headaches. One night, when the pain grew unbearable, she called for the nurse, who shone a torch into a puncture wound in her head. There was a gasp, and the nurse said they needed to call the doctor; he explained that her head wounds were filled with maggots, which were eating the infected flesh. It says something about the difficulties of those early days that this came as a relief: confirmation that she was not, in fact, suffering brain injuries. She and Matt boarded an evacuation flight on New Year\u2019s Day and went to stay with his parents in Devon, their base for the next six months. Her emotions in that period were tumultuous. \u201cIt was an insane mix of being unbelievably happy to be alive, feeling guilty for feeling that, and then coming to terms with the loss of my family.\u201d Her mother\u2019s body was recovered in the spring of 2005, and in the winter of that year they were told informally that there was little hope of finding Alice. \u201cThe fact that her body was never found leaves question marks, and somewhere in my subconscious it doesn\u2019t quite make sense, which means I still have very vivid dreams about her. It almost catches me by surprise, still now, that I had a little sister whom I was so close to, and I know that the tsunami happened to her, but beyond that I don\u2019t know anything.\u201d She struggled with flashbacks, \u201creliving certain moments and replaying them, trying to work out if I could have done anything differently, and not being able to stop those thoughts. They overtook my life for a while.\u201d Images of water were overwhelming at first, but she addressed this fear in stages, driving to the sea and looking at it from the car; then going on to the beach; then swimming \u2013 a few years after the tsunami, she took part in a cross-Channel relay swim, each participant swimming for an hour at a time. Overall, the experience has made Fassnidge more ambitious, but also more afraid, seeing the potential danger in everything. She didn\u2019t feel confident enough to return to the classroom and now works in corporate responsibility for a charity, but her life is full of other possibilities, too. There\u2019s her plan to get her book published, her hopes of working in injury rehabilitation, and she and Matt, who married in 2009, have thought about opening an adventure lodge in the countryside. They also run a charity with two friends called Music for Alice, giving funding to groups and institutions so that they can buy musical instruments. Since the tsunami, Fassnidge says she feels as if she\u2019s living for her mother and Alice as well as herself. \u201cI don\u2019t find that a pressure, I find it a positive. Above all, I know now that in a split second you can lose everything.\u201d   \u2022 Edie Fassnidge appears in a new documentary, After The Wave, showing on the Discovery Channel in December.

The Thai authorities\u2019 handling of the case has caused additional heartbreak for the victims\u2019 families and damaged Thailand\u2019s reputation as a tourist destination. It has also exposed the brutality of the country\u2019s flawed justice system. The beginning was awful enough. Two young Britons on the holiday of their dreams went out to the beach one evening and never came back. Two days later, the head of Thailand\u2019s military regime, who had taken power in a May 2014 coup, responded insensitively by advising female tourists not to wear bikinis on the beach in order to stay safe. Under pressure, the Thai police rapidly announced that they had identified two suspects \u2013 conveniently, also foreigners; they were young migrant workers from neighbouring Burma, who had apparently confessed to the crime not too long after they were arrested. But then the case began to disintegrate. Thai internet users raised substantial questions concerning the official version of events. Allegations surfaced that the suspects had been tortured or physically mistreated by police, and their lawyers eventually retracted their confessions. The British Foreign Office summoned a Thai diplomat, while Burma and human rights lawyers expressed grave concerns. Now, the men concerned have told the Guardian that they are innocent. They have asked the victims\u2019 families and the UK government to help them clear their names. Yet the Thai junta insists that the correct culprits have been caught and the police have warned that social media criticism of the case can constitute a crime. A hundred thousand people signed an online petition asking for an independent investigation. Thai prosecutors have said the two Burmese men will remain locked up while the investigation is being prepared for trial, and the Thai human rights body has conveniently postponed its inquiry due to scheduling issues. What has happened in the case of Witheridge and Miller is not exclusive to foreigners. Thais struggle every day to find access to justice and their plight gets little publicity. The recent military coup and the imposition of martial law, however, has heightened concern over the Thai experience of military jurisdiction. In October, a military court sentenced two anti-coup civilians to jail on suspended sentences. Chainarin Kularbum was given a three-month suspended sentence for joining a public grouping that was larger than five \u2013 the limit set by the military regime. Yodyiam Srimanta received a six-month suspended sentence for not responding to a summons \u2013 one of the military practices introduced by the regime to curb dissent. There is no appeal available for Chainarin and Yodyiam, and to make matters worse, the military court ordered all observers not to take notes during the trial, while the junta regularly warns media to refrain from criticism of the regime. In another recent case, two university students, Patiwat Saraiyaem, 23 and Pornthip Munkong, 25, were arrested and held without bail for more than three months before a charge was brought. One might question whether they were really serial offenders posing a flight risk. All they did was to stage a play at a university, which was seen by the police as lese-majesty: defamation of the monarch. Even the leadership in Thailand can\u2019t seem to escape the problem. In 2006, the military staged a coup to oust the prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, and then appointed his opponents to investigate him and examine his assets, leading to controversial convictions that forced him to remain in exile. In 2008, Thaksin\u2019s ally and successor Samak Sundaravej was sacked as prime minister for hosting a cookery programme on television; this was declared to be a conflict of interest by a constitutional court whose members had been appointed after the 2006 military coup. Then in May this year, the government \u2013 led by Yingluck Shinawatra, Thaksin\u2019s sister, who also had won a democratic election \u2013 was also overthrown by the military. This followed a series of controversial judicial decisions that invalidated election results, removed the prime minister and blocked the government from resolving protests that had shut down Bangkok\u2019s streets for several months. The military took this as their pretext to intervene and the courts had no problem with that. Consequently, any democratic effort to scrutinise politicians and subject them to justice is perceived as irrelevant, as staging a coup becomes the ultimate solution. Yingluck, for instance, faces the bizarre prospect of retrospective impeachment by a post-coup assembly, which could result in a political ban. Thailand has entered dangerous waters not merely because of its failure to prevent murder, but by its apparent disregard of fundamental rights, especially around access to justice. Tourists from Britain and around the world count on our justice system to be fair and transparent. Now, we Thais must count on the international community to demand the return of Thai democracy and to restore the rule of law. That must include reforming the Thai justice system and systematically rooting out the injustices it has been used to perpetuate.", "publicationDate": "2014-11-21T13:06:55Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "Human rights", "Law"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/21/democracy-rule-law-thailand-murders-britons", "title": "Democracy and the rule of law must be restored to Thailand | Verapat Pariyawong", "sentences": ["This followed a series of controversial judicial decisions that invalidated election results, removed the prime minister and blocked the government from resolving protests that had shut down Bangkok\u2019s streets for several months."]}, {"article": "Six weeks on, there is little to mark the spot on the idyllic rocky beach inlet on Koh Tao where Hannah Witheridge and David Miller met such brutal deaths; just two tiny piles of stones separated by a line of twigs in the sand, someone\u2019s modest, anonymous, temporary memorial. A few hundred yards away along Sairee beach, the main tourist drag on the Thai holiday island, life continues as normal. Business, says a French man running a dive shop \u2013 much of Koh Tao\u2019s tourism is based around diving \u2013 is actually busier than expected for the monsoon season. \u201cAfter the murders you did notice that there were fewer people for a bit. But it was only really the British that stayed away. With everyone else, they didn\u2019t even really notice.\u201d If this appears curious then Koh Tao, the smallest and most remote among a trio of tourism-dominated islands in the Gulf of Thailand, abounds in such paradoxes. It is a place where visitors spend their days learning the rigorous safety standards of diving before hopping, without helmets and clad in shorts and vest, on to rickety rental motorbikes. Tourist deaths are not unknown \u2013 two bodies of drowned westerners were found in the sea within a couple of days this month \u2013 but it is known as one of the safer spots in Thailand. The biggest contradiction centres around the deaths of Witheridge, 23, and Miller, 24 \u2013 the British backpackers brutally beaten on the head yards from their hotel, the former also raped, the latter left to drown in shallow surf. Just about everyone on Koh Tao insists visitors are safe, but many also agree, quietly, that the Burmese migrant workers arrested for the murders are innocent \u2013 meaning the real killer or killers remain at large.     Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were brutally murdered while staying on Koh Tao. Photograph: PA    The island, two hours by boat from the nearest airport, has a low-key, undeveloped feel and mainly attracts younger backpackers. But the ramshackle charm and gentle, palm-dotted beaches are drawing more visitors each year, necessitating new workers. Many are Burmese, with around 3,000 now on Koh Tao, according to one community leader. \u201cThe migrants come here for just one reason \u2013 they want a better life, and they\u2019re looking for a job so they can send money back home,\u201d said the man who, like almost everyone else on the island, asked to not be named. Increasing numbers of Burmese staff the bars and restaurants, in part due to their competent English \u2013 an educational legacy of British rule in their home country. More than 3 million Burmese live in Thailand. As well as low pay and poor conditions, rights groups say, the frequently undocumented migrants face regular and open discrimination, and it is not unknown for police to wrongly blame them for crimes. As the hunt for the Britons\u2019 killers dragged into a third week and the junta\u2019s prime minister, General Prayuth Chan-ocha, said migrants were the most likely culprits, there was understandable nervousness on Koh Tao. \u201cShortly after the killings the migrant community started to tell us there was a lot of torture going on, a lot of abuse by the police,\u201d recalled Andy Hall, a British activist who has lived in Thailand for a decade, mainly working with Burmese. \u201cWe sent a team down and interviewed the workers, and they were saying, \u2018Help us, or they\u2019re going to find a scapegoat.\u2019 And then the Burmese men got arrested.\u201d     Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo, the two Burmese migrant workers arrested for the murders of Witheridge and Miller. Photograph: Bangkok Post / Barcroft Media    Police said they had confessed, explaining that they found Witheridge and Miller kissing on the beach and, being \u201caroused\u201d, beat them viciously with a hoe. The case was solved. Except it was not. Within a few days the men said they had been tortured and withdrew the confessions. Rights groups expressed alarm. The police deny the allegations of torture. Britain called in a senior Thai diplomat to express its concern. Finally, with deep reluctance and only after David Cameron personally pressured Chan-ocha at a summit in Milan, Thailand agreed to let Metropolitan police detectives review the case. Now the situation is at an impasse, with prosecutors still awaiting a much-delayed police report. Last Wednesday, a judge remanded the suspects in custody for another 12 days, but warned that without a prosecution they must be freed in little more than a month. Opinion in Thailand is split. While the government and police chiefs maintain they have their men, others argue the investigation is too obviously motivated by what one Bangkok Post editorial called \u201crampant ethnic prejudice\u201d. Among the sceptics is Nakhon Chomphuchat, the leading Thai human rights lawyer defending the suspects. \u201cIf I thought they had done it I couldn\u2019t work for them,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cOf course, no one can ever say with 100% accuracy, but I\u2019m pretty certain they didn\u2019t.\u201d           Thai police make alleged killers re-enact murders on Koh Tao beach.    Chomphuchat and others note numerous concerns beyond the confessions. A key part of the police case is DNA evidence supposedly tying the men to the scene. However, Thailand\u2019s most senior pathologist expressed alarm on learning the samples were not collected by trained forensic officers. Meanwhile, CCTV of the key night shows one suspect, Wai Phyo, wearing the same pristine white T-shirt in which he was later arrested. Chomphuchat and others also stress how unlikely it is for two unworldly young men to commit such a vicious crime and then work as normal for three weeks, even volunteering for DNA tests. In an interview with the Guardian during their court hearing the pair appeared awed and naive, talking excitedly about their love of Manchester United and the thrill of being transferred on a police helicopter. On Koh Tao, many Thais believe the culprits are Burmese. \u201cA local wouldn\u2019t do it \u2013 the locals are friendly,\u201d said a man in his 40s. \u201cBut with more development we need migrant workers to help, and these can bring more problems.\u201d Another man, a taxi driver, said: \u201cCCTV shows the men were there, and there\u2019s the DNA tests. Even if we don\u2019t know who the real killer is they\u2019re not Thai, for sure.\u201d There are several counter theories circulating on Koh Tao about who killed Witheridge and Miller. Most centre around men associated with a dominant Thai family on the island, one of several that run dive schools, resorts and bars. A version recounted repeatedly - without any evidence - is that Witheridge had an argument with one of them at a beachside bar run by the family, shortly before the killings. The associated media coverage has seen Koh Tao characterised as mafia-run. One English woman, who has lived in the area for many years, says the term is misleading: \u201cThe mafia here aren\u2019t the sort who carry guns in violin cases, or knock on doors extorting people. They\u2019re the families that go back for generations, and who ran the islands before the police even got here.\u201d     Zaw Lin (left) and Wai Phyo have retracted their confessions in the murder case. Photograph: Andy Hall for the Guardian    Nonetheless, there is real fear. Several islanders who believe they know who killed Witheridge and Miller have fled. Those who remain stay silent, for good reason, according to the woman: \u201cIf you speak out you\u2019ll suddenly find the landlord of your business doesn\u2019t want to know [you] anymore, or you can\u2019t get a visa. Very occasionally, people disappear.\u201d The curiosity is that for the vast majority of tourists Koh Tao is safe, at least by the perilous standards of Thailand. In the last 12 months 362 Britons died in Thailand, more than did so in France, which attracts nearly 20 times more British tourists. This is partly down to Thailand\u2019s younger tourist demographic but also the country\u2019s treacherous roads. Tourists do fall off motorbikes on Koh Tao \u2013 one diving instructor says a student a week is unable to finish a course as they\u2019re swathed in bandages \u2013 but the slower, sparser traffic makes very serious incidents less common. Sairee beach has its rowdy bars along the narrow network of lanes by the beachfront. However, the nightlife culture is tempered by the numbers going diving early in the morning. Drugs are not unknown, but not endemic as on Koh Phangan, the adjoining island famed for its full moon beach parties. Likewise, swimmers do get caught out by currents, but not notably more than elsewhere.     A police diver searches for clues near the spot where Witheridge and Miller were killed Photograph: Chaiwat Subprasom/Reuters    There is even a local theory that the dominant families actually keep Koh Tao more secure \u2013 they have become fantastically rich through tourism and take a dim view of crime. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt as safe living anywhere,\u201d said one young Canadian woman based on the island. This is what makes the murders of Witheridge and Miller simultaneously so exceptional and difficult to resolve. If the theories are correct, and the real killers are wayward elements of a dominant family, their wealth and hold over police makes it very unlikely they will face charges. At the centre of this impasse \u2013 and facing possible execution by lethal injection \u2013 are Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo. However much the evidence might tip in their favour, to not prosecute would mean acknowledging that a high-profile investigation endorsed by the junta was flawed. Equally central, and in danger of being forgotten amid their current silence, are the grieving families of Witheridge and Miller, who have yet to express a view. Last week lawyers for Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo passed a handwritten letter from the pair to the Guardian, appealing to the British families to share any information that could spare them. A key moment will come with the completion of the Met\u2019s report, which will be shown first to the grieving relatives.

While cuts to Four Corners, Australian Story and Landline will be relatively modest, Lateline will take the biggest hit with all its staff put on a redundancy list pending a skills audit. Foreign Correspondent has lost 10% of its budget. The big changes in the news division include cutting all radio news bulletins except 7am and 7.45am from 10 to five minutes, and reducing the size of the fact-checking unit. Half the features producers on Radio National will be made redundant and five programs will be decommissioned: 360 Documentaries; Into the Music; Poetica; Hindsight and Encounter. Experienced program-makers will be replaced with freelancers. Bush Telegraph, the rural news and features program commissioned in the Howard era after complaints the ABC was too city-centred, has also been axed. As tipped on Guardian Australia, the ABC has commissioned a new program hosted by a conservative voice, the former opinion editor at the Australian Tom Switzer.  \u201cIn a media environment saturated with opinion \u2013 much of it repetitive in its perspective \u2013 Tom Switzer would filter through that, pointing the audience to new and different takes on the big issues, sometimes including his own analysis,\u201d the ABC said in a statement to staff. News director Kate Torney briefed the 1,500 news staff on the details of the changes on Monday afternoon. She said 70 new digital positions would be created as more resources were poured into online and mobile news. But those positions will be lower paid, sources said. The 100 redundancies announced across the news division are not voluntary. Journalists whose programs have been targeted for job losses will be measured against an objective \u201cskill set\u201d, sources said. Those deemed not to have the required skills for the remaining positions will be made redundant. The same process will apply to staff in Radio National. \u201cPlenty of room for discrimination there, and no transparency,\u201d one source said. A national Friday edition of 7.30 will be launched following the cancellation of the eight local editions. Local current affairs coverage will be included in specials and across the 7pm News, ABC News Sunday, News 24, local radio and local digital sites, as reported by Guardian Australia. Lateline has survived the axe but will be moved to a fixed timeslot on News 24 and will have a makeover, the details of which have yet to be announced. Management said Lateline would also focus more on its digital audience. In international news gathering, the Auckland bureau will close and New Zealand will be covered from Australia. The Tokyo, Bangkok, Delhi and Jerusalem offices will be closed and the camera crews made redundant, as reported earlier this month. Teams will be replaced by video journalists working from home with the help of a local producer. Staff were told that precautions would be taken to protect video journalists working alone. Bigger bureaux will be established in Washington, London, Beijing and Jakarta, and the number of foreign correspondents will stay the same. A new role of chief foreign correspondent will be created. The president of the Community and Public Sector Union, Michael Tull, accused the government of lying.  \u201cAfter promising not to cut, the government has cut millions from the ABC\u2019s budget and forced it to slash one in 10 jobs from its workforce. It is now abundantly clear that the government\u2019s cuts will seriously impact the quality of programming, despite assurances by Malcolm Turnbull to the contrary.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2014-11-24T05:49:47Z", "tags": ["Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "Australian media", "Radio", "Television industry", "Australian television", "Television", "Television & radio", "Australia news", "Mark Scott", "Coalition", "Australian politics"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/nov/24/abc-news-division-axe-100-jobs-budget-slashed-top-tv-programs", "title": "ABC news division to axe 100 jobs as budget slashed from top TV programs", "sentences": ["The Tokyo, Bangkok, Delhi and Jerusalem offices will be closed and the camera crews made redundant, as reported earlier this month."]}, {"article": "A few years ago, the trendy Mumbai shopping district of Bandra lost the gay-friendly icon of Azaad Bazaar when high rental costs forced it to close. Now, the city has lost exclusive gay fashion store D\u2019kloset \u2013 and this time it is not only rising commercial rents that spelled doom for the store \u2013 but also a judgement by the Indian supreme court to criminalise gay sex. When the supreme court reversed a Delhi high court judgment that legalised consensual gay sex, it reinstated Section 377 of the penal code \u2013 a provision introduced by the British colonial government in 1861 which criminalises what it calls \u201ccarnal intercourse against the order of nature\u201d and effectively bans same-sex relationships.  Entrepreneur Inder Vhatwar \u2013 who worked his way up from the Golibar slum to found D\u2019kloset as \u2018India\u2019s first PINK retail for men\u2019 \u2013 says he and his customers now live in fear of being targeted by Hindu extremist groups.  Vhatwar says his currently landlord has refused to renew his lease on the store, and he has already been turned down by two potential landlords. \u201cThey clearly told me that they didn\u2019t want any issues at the store, because Section 377 made us criminals\u201d, he said. \u201cI never thought that one verdict could affect my life so much\u201d, Vhatwar added. \u201cI support myself and my family with the revenue of the store \u2026 The owner did not know about the gay concept before, so there was no problem.\u201d     Bandra seems to be the Soho of Mumbai. pic.twitter.com/IMYiIXFykm&mdash; Stephen Fry (@stephenfry) March 1, 2013    Since D\u2019kloset shut its doors a month ago, Vhatwar has been selling clothes to regular customers from his apartment. But it is not just finances that worry Vhatwar: the ban on same-sex relationships affects his daily life.  \u201cI stay with my partner in a rented apartment and after this [reinstatement of Section 377], we lead a low-profile life. We have stopped going out a lot and invite friends home instead.\u201d He says another gay couple were evicted by their landlady, and tales of blackmail are rife. A few years ago, none of this was a problem for Vhatwar. After the Delhi high court struck down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code in 2009 for violating fundamental human rights, gay culture in India became more open \u2013 with pride marches, gay magazines, dating sites and gay-friendly stores making an appearance. When some of Vhatwar\u2019s friends wanted to invest in a start-up in Mumbai, he floated the idea of a gay fashion store that would offer the community a place to shop without any inhibitions \u2013 sparked by his own negative experience shopping in the city\u2019s malls. \u201cWhen I asked for skinny jeans, store representatives would bring the jeans from the women\u2019s section and pass snide remarks.\u201d He opened D\u2019kloset in December 2010 with stock from Bangkok and China, later moving in to clothes production.     Inder Vhatwar in the doorway of his old house in the Golibar slum    At first Vhatwar didn\u2019t tell his family about D\u2019kloset \u2013 but when a front-page news article featured his shop, he called his sister and told her to show the family. They were overjoyed.  \u201cLooking back at the start of my life in Golibar, it\u2019s painful to realise that I never really had a childhood,\u201d said Vhatwar. \u201cMy father died when I was three years old, and my earliest memories were of my mother struggling to bring up three children in a slum where even clean water was considered a luxury. My passion has enabled the entire family to come out of the slum and stay in a better locality.\u201d Vikram Doctor, one of the organisers of Gay Bombay, which aims to create safe spaces for the city\u2019s gay community, said: \u201cStores like Azaad Bazaar and D\u2019kloset used to be a meeting place for the young LGBT crowd. Running an LGBT store is difficult in a city where even a normal boutique finds it hard to survive. It\u2019s a landlord\u2019s market. If there is any sort of controversy, they will definitely say no. Further, LGBT stores across the world are shutting down due to the presence of e-commerce websites like Amazon. We need more cultural centres which are funded.\u201d \u201cThe price-point is definitely the USP of the store,\u201d said 22-year-old customer Meet Parekh. \u201cThe clothes are more affordable than those from other boutiques \u2026 And the fact that the store is run by a gay guy makes members of the gay community automatically shed their inhibitions.\u201d  Vhatwar says Bollywood stars came to his shop and gay tourists from all over the country used to visit. Last year British comedian Stephen Fry paid a visit to D\u2019kloset while filming his BBC documentary Out There. And some prominent Mumbaikars continue to back Vhatwar. \u201cInder is a self-made person and has come up in life through immense challenges\u201d, said Bollywood actress Celina Jaitly. \u201cIt is absolutely not acceptable that he cannot continue his dreams and this amazing concept of D\u2019kloset because of an archaic law.\u201d This article was commissioned as part of the Guardian\u2019s Citizen Reporting Programme", "publicationDate": "2014-11-28T06:16:18Z", "tags": ["Cities", "India", "LGBT rights", "Society", "Sexuality", "Shops and shopping", "Stephen Fry"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/nov/28/dkloset-closes-mumbai-gay-fashion-store-lost-fight-survival", "title": "D'kloset closes: how the only gay shop in Mumbai lost its fight for survival", "sentences": ["\u201cWhen I asked for skinny jeans, store representatives would bring the jeans from the women\u2019s section and pass snide remarks.\u201d He opened D\u2019kloset in December 2010 with stock from Bangkok and China, later moving in to clothes production."]}, {"article": "Long before Greg Page became the executive chairman of Cargill, one of the world\u2019s largest food companies, the company dispatched him to Thailand to build a chicken plant in a rural province north of Bangkok. \u201cIt was a chance\u201d, he said, \u201cto start a business from scratch in an overseas location, while having access to the resources of Cargill\u201d. Plus, he noted with a smile, he was \u201c12 hours from headquarters ... I loved it\u201d. Today, Cargill Meats Thailand imports soymeal from Brazil and Argentina to feed chickens, which are raised, slaughtered, processed, cooked and frozen into a wide range of products, most destined for restaurants and supermarkets in Japan, Europe, Canada and Hong Kong. Chicken parts that don\u2019t appeal to western appetites \u2014 feet, heads and the like \u2014 are consumed locally or exported to nearby Asian markets. To locavores who want to look their farmer in the eye, to the advocates of food sovereignty, and to those who argue that \u2018cooking solves everything\u2019, this is a nightmarish way to produce food. But to Greg Page, who has spent 41 years at Cargill and is now its executive chairman, global trade in food and agriculture is not only good for producers and consumers \u2014 it\u2019s also a key element of a sustainable food system. \u201cTrade facilitates sustainability,\u201d Page said when we met recently at Cargill\u2019s Washington DC office. \u201cThe world was not endowed with good soil and good rainfall equally. You want to move production to the right soil and the right climate, where it belongs.\u201d Why grow coffee in California? This, of course, is what you\u2019d expect a Cargill employee to say. Food remains predominantly a regional business \u2014 roughly 80% of all food is consumed in the country where it\u2019s grown, and most of its is grown by small-scale farmers \u2014 but when food does cross borders, Cargill is likely to play a role. The privately-held company, which has 145,000 employees working in 67 countries, generated about $135bn in revenue in the 2014 fiscal year, much of it by moving such commodities as corn, soy, wheat, sugar palm oil, cocoa and meat from places where they are grown to places where they are consumed. The Thailand chicken business is a case study in globalization. Once Thailand lifted trade barriers that made it hard to import soy, Cargill saw an opportunity, opening its first processing plant in 1989 to take advantage of the availability of low-cost labor. That investment, over time, led to the creation of 13,300 jobs in Thailand, expanded the market for soy grown by farmers in South America and delivered ready-to-eat chicken at affordable prices to consumers in Japan, Europe and Canada. \u201cThis is Adam Smith and Hayek and Ricardo played out at very high speed,\u201d says Page, citing classical liberal economists who argued that trade generates the prosperity much of the world enjoys today. While many industries \u2014 apparel, electronics, toys \u2014 have been thoroughly globalized, trade in food and agriculture is far from unfettered. Tariffs and quotas protect US sugar producers from competition. Russia restricts imports of chicken from the US. Japan imposes stiff tariffs on imported rice and wheat. The European Union, meantime, has barred imports of animals injected with hormones and keeps out some GMO crops. Some of the trade barriers reflect geopolitical issues, others are purely protectionist and still others are justified by concerns over food safety or agricultural practices. \u201cThey are very real issues,\u201d Page acknowledges. \u201cFood is emotional.\u201d But history indicates that the laws of nature will ultimately trump costly experiments in localism. In perhaps the most dramatic experiment in recent history, oil-rich Saudi Arabia spent billions of dollars in the 1970s to create a wheat industry using huge price supports, low-interest loans to farmers and cheap, subsidized water, eventually becoming one of the world\u2019s largest exporters of wheat\u2014quite an accomplishment in a country that receives an average of about four inches of rain a year, one of the lowest rates in the world. Needless to say, it couldn\u2019t last \u2014 dwindling water resources led the kingdom to phase out subsidies in the late 2000s and it intends to halt all wheat production by 2016, in an effort to preserve its water. What\u2019s more, the environmental benefits of buying local are unclear. A 2008 study found that transportation accounts for only 11% of food\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, with the final delivery segment from producer to market responsible for a mere 4%. Climate emissions depend on whether food is transported by plane, ship, train or truck. Says Page: \u201cWhen a Ford 150 pickup pulls up to somebody\u2019s house and drops off four pounds of tomatoes, I can assure you that the greenhouse gas footprint of that production model is not superior to conventional agriculture.\u201d This isn\u2019t to say that locally-grown food doesn\u2019t deliver social and economic benefits. Cargill hosts a farmers\u2019 market at its headquarters in Minneapolis, offering not just fresh fruits and vegetables but face-to-face encounters between farmers and consumers. The growth in local food production and farmers\u2019 markets has \u201ccertainly been a net positive for rural employment in Minnesota, and in other places as well\u201d, Page says. Agriculture is \u201cgoing to remain a very local business\u201d, Page says, but if water and climate emissions are fully priced into the cost of food, it will likely become more global over time. One thing\u2019s certain \u2014 it will never again be all-local. After all, as economist Russ Roberts has said: \u201cWe tried buying local once. It was called the Middle Ages.\u201d Read more like this:  Business and entrepreneurs seize opportunities in rise of veganism Supermarkets\u2019 struggle for economic survival must not come at expense of human rights In man v food, there can be no winner Eating challenges from around the world - in pictures  The food hub is funded by The Irish Food Board.

These \u201cshocks and stresses\u201d may vary widely between the chosen cities, ranging from natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods to long-term challenges such as social cohesion, access to healthcare, levels of violence and the free movement of people and goods for economic prosperity. The latest round of inductees will be revealed at an Urban Resilience Summit in Singapore that will also address issues including climate change \u2013 which is influencing natural disasters that have so far caused an estimated US $2.5 trillion in worldwide damage this century \u2013 transport and communications infrastructure. The first 33 cities were named last December, having been chosen by a group of judges including former US president Bill Clinton from nearly 400 applications. The cities ranged from Glasgow and Rotterdam in Europe to Melbourne in Australia. Dakar, Rio de Janeiro and Bangkok also made the list, along with 12 cities from North America, including New York. Cities included in the list will be provided financial and logistical help via their own \u201cchief resilience officer\u201d, who will spearhead resilience efforts. Further help will be provided via public and private providers, as well as other cities in the 100 cities network. Judith Rodin, the Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s president, told the Guardian earlier this year: \u201cYour city\u2019s vulnerability to water may require an 8ft-tall dike, while another city requires natural infrastructure like archipelagoes and oyster beds. Those are very different practices, but they represent the same resilience principle, which is that you\u2019ve got to figure out how to deal with water in a way that really works.\u201d The Rockefeller Foundation has said it wants to help fashion a set of standardised resilient principles for cities, pointing out that city growth means that 75% of the world\u2019s population will live in urban areas by 2050.

He has welcomed the suite of measures announced by the minister to limit the number of \u201cnaive\u201d or vexatious claims. Many of the measures, such as a public awareness campaign on consular services, improving the government\u2019s Smart Traveller website and enhancing Dfat\u2019s social media presence, aim to build understanding of the role the department plays abroad. Brown said the provision to limit consular assistance would only apply to known troublemakers, and was in line with measures considered by other western countries. Both Brown and Bishop insisted that Australians who genuinely required help while abroad would receive that help. \u201cThere are people we colloquially refer to as serial pests who are constantly bouncing back into the embassy because they\u2019ve run out of money or they\u2019ve got some other personal problem they want consular staff to solve,\u201d Brown said. \u201cPeople who are wilfully, repeatedly or negligently applying for assistance.\u201d  The move aims to \u201cpromote a stronger culture of self-reliance\u201d with travellers, Bishop said, adding that vexatious claims by people who \u201cgame the system\u201d are rare but \u201ccome up from time to time\u201d. She said limiting consular assistance was not a budget savings measure, and would have a \u201cminuscule\u201d impact on the bottom line. Bishop said the new guidelines for assistance would help consular staff, who she admitted sometimes approved claims by problematic claimants because it was easier than querying them.", "publicationDate": "2014-12-03T03:58:52Z", "tags": ["Australia news", "Julie Bishop", "Coalition", "Australian politics"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/dec/03/australians-abroad-may-be-cut-consular-assistance-claims-crackdown", "title": "Australians abroad may be cut off from consular assistance in claims crackdown", "sentences": ["They cite the case of an Australian man who walked into the Australian embassy in Bangkok and asked for a loan to help pay for the services of his Thai prostitute, who he had brought with him."]}, {"article": "Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says it wants to put an end to unnecessary requests for help from travellers and expats.

The place was Forest Fringe, a DIY non-profit setup that has become an Edinburgh institution, spread its wings around the globe and been hailed as the future of theatre. It all started in 2007, when Edinburgh\u2019s Forest Cafe \u2013 a gnarly, buzzy enclave housed in an old church building \u2013 invited live artist Deborah Pearson to put shows on in its upstairs hall during the fringe. Along with Andy Field and Ira Brand, she programmed the kind of adventurous, intimate, experimental and participatory work then struggling to find a place in the fringe. \u201cWe wanted to create a space that allowed artists to do whatever they want, however unsustainable or naive or beautifully stupid that might be,\u201d Field recalls. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really have any money so we had to be resourceful, lo-fi and collaborative just to make anything happen. We spent a lot of time thinking about the spaces in and around the building: old shop units, the upstairs window of a bookshop, the alley behind the cafe, the garden. We spent three days turning a grungy basement rehearsal dungeon into a spotless halogen-lit white conference room for Ant Hampton\u2019s GuruGuru\u201d \u2013 a show in which an audience of just five people were told via headphones what to say.     Deborah Pearson. Photograph: Morgan McBride    That DIY ethos, as old as art itself, also proved prescient \u2013 a template for making work in an age of austerity. Forest Fringe has gone from strength to strength in Edinburgh, relocating to its own dedicated premises, and branching out into site-specific work and \u201cmicrofestivals\u201d worldwide, from audio journeys for London nightbuses to a reimagining of an old Bangkok cinema. And they\u2019re not the only ones championing the cheap, the weird and the brave: Field points to other ground-up, artist-led organisations such as Glasgow\u2019s Buzzcut festival and Residence in Bristol. \u201cI think we\u2019re all sort of the children of Shunt and the incredible things they achieved in the vaults under London Bridge. Their playfulness, their generosity, their genuine sense of reckless fun \u2013 it\u2019s buried in the bone marrow of what we try and do.\u201d Despite growing success, including backing from the Arts Council and Live Art UK, Field reports \u201csurprisingly few\u201d changes to how Forest Fringe does its thing. \u201cWe still aren\u2019t technically a business. We still don\u2019t have an office.\u201d They still consider themselves DIY \u2013 and think it\u2019s a vital approach at a time when mainstream timidity and lack of access for working-class artists threaten to \u201cmake our culture thinner and greyer\u201d. For Field, DIY is \u201can ideology rather than an aesthetic. It\u2019s not defined by handmade props or deliberately shonky effects, though it sometimes is those things. It\u2019s about finding alternative modes of production, ways of making art that invite us to imagine and inhabit different, hopefully better, ways of living in the world.\u201d See more at forestfringe.co.uk", "publicationDate": "2014-12-06T08:00:11Z", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Culture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/dec/06/forest-fringe-diy-theatre", "title": "Forest Fringe: the DIY theatre extremists", "sentences": ["Forest Fringe has gone from strength to strength in Edinburgh, relocating to its own dedicated premises, and branching out into site-specific work and \u201cmicrofestivals\u201d worldwide, from audio journeys for London nightbuses to a reimagining of an old Bangkok cinema."]}, {"article": "Sony Pictures employees are being threatened via email after hackers broke into the movie studio\u2019s computer network, the US Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) confirmed.

The remark was made to a committee of MPs by Neil Couling, the services director at the Department for Work and Pensions, and an expert on mediocrity thanks to his role in implementing the universal credit scheme. Couling explained to MPs that Sutton was the ideal place to trail a new benefits service because it had such an average population. \u201cIt\u2019s the most normal place in Britain,\u201d he said. \u201cIts population is average for the United Kingdom as a whole.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful place and I adore it,\u201d before seemingly admitting that he had never actually been there. On that evidential basis, I too am happy to declare my love for Sutton, and also to declare that it\u2019s too boring to discuss any further. Not least because thinking about what makes the residents of Sutton so \u201cnormal\u201d immediately gets me wondering about what an abnormal set of UK people might look like? Where can the DWP go to make an even bigger hash of their trial scheme than the one they\u2019ll undoubtedly make in Sutton? These are my suggestions: Cambridge     Distinctly non-average \u2026 Cambridge University students after the Trinity May Ball.

This isn\u2019t so much to do with the fact that they are academic high achievers, or that over the years the place has generated more Nobel prize winners than France, as the fact that these are people who call kitchens \u201cgyp rooms\u201d, have their stuff tidied by \u201cbedders\u201d and most of whom don medieval gowns every other week in order to have their food served to them in candlelit halls.

Here the local industry apparently consists of flogging crystals, catching dreams and explaining to people that they have been horribly treated in a past life. No doubt that any data gathered here would skew the DWP survey massively \u2013 although possibly the strangest thing about Glastonbury is the way it warps reality. After a few hours in town, all the people smelling of patchouli and weed start to look the same and seem oddly conformist. It\u2019s a place where being out there is entirely normal.

But it\u2019s the hidden stuff that makes this place truly strange. The fact that the City of London Corporation, which runs the Square Mile, has its own police force and better still its own militia. The fact that it has someone called the Remembrancer who gets to sit unelected in the House of Commons, right behind the Speaker\u2019s chair and check through all legislation that the house passes. The fact that the elected representatives in the Corporation rely on a medieval system of voting that gives most of the votes away to non-residents, who don\u2019t actually get to vote because the votes are allotted to banks and corporations within the Square Mile, whose company appointees then decide who will be elected. The truth is that this might as well be an entirely separate state to the UK \u2013 and that thanks to its financial clout and remorseless lobbying, the usual rules just don\u2019t apply here. \u2022 Tell us the most eccentric place you\u2019ve ever been in the thread below  This article has been corrected on 12 December to remove a reference to company bosses voting in the City of London; it is company appointees who make the decision.

This announcement might seem counter-intuitive to some. With chronic food and water shortages that are exacerbated by climate change, a burgeoning population of 735,000 \u2013 43% of whom are under the age of 15 \u2013 an unemployment rate of 48% and a history of 28 coups within the past 40 years, the tiny island nation faces an uncertain and potentially volatile future. Why then would they decide to devote so much territory to conservation rather than exploiting it for development? In fact, the decision to invest in nature makes perfect sense to the government of Comoros, for whom conservation is development since it is believed that protected areas can play a strategic role in the country\u2019s broader development plans. The Comoros government understands that safeguarding the country\u2019s diverse ecosystems is an efficient means of maintaining food and water security, creating jobs, sustaining livelihoods and providing a buffer from the worst of climate change impacts. An investment in nature protection is an investment in national peace, progress and prosperity. The Union of Comoros reflects the challenges and choices that our whole planet will face in coming decades: how to sustain a growing population on a hotter, increasingly water-stressed planet with tumultuous, unpredictable weather. As goes the island, so goes the mainland. The eight-day Congress resulted in the \u201cPromise of Sydney\u201d, a manifesto that the 6,000 participants hope will shape protected area and economic development discourse for the coming decade. Three strong messages, and reasons for hope, emerged from the event. The first is that the conservation community has become better at valuing the benefits of nature, using the language of economic decision makers and investors, and accounting for protected area values as part of the economy. Park authorities, environment ministries, conservation organisations and development agencies are talking about jobs created, water and erosion control services delivered, and storm damage costs averted, not just numbers of species saved. The tally of those services is impressive, and underscores the ability of biodiversity and protected areas to deliver on a wide range of development goals. Nelson Devanadera, executive director at Republic of the Philippines\u2019 Palawan Council for Sustainable Development, for example, explained how natural capital accounting is informing decision-making on investment trade-offs and economic development in Southern Palawan. Meanwhile Norbu Wangchuk, officiating chief at the Gross National Happiness Commission for the Royal Government of Bhutan, spoke of the importance of conservation to the country\u2019s Gross National Happiness \u2013 60% of the population depends on ecosystem services for their livelihoods, an undervalued green economy worth $15.5bn (\u00a39.8bn), five times more than the official GDP. The second reason is that nature is increasingly recognised as an important land use asset in feeding a planet projected to grow to 11 billion by 2100, and meeting the world\u2019s multi-billion dollar infrastructure needs. For example, the Thai government is investing in wetland protection to mitigate the impacts of the next deluge in Bangkok. Whether the issue is reducing the risk from natural disasters, storing carbon, or protecting clean water sources for agriculture, aquaculture and cities, healthy protected ecosystems provide precious natural infrastructure for green growth today and a low-cost insurance policy for the shocks and stresses of tomorrow. The third message to come out of the Congress is that parks alone are insufficient lifeboats to help us weather the perfect storm of population growth, unrestrained consumption, loss of biodiversity and climate change. Parks cannot provide benefits in isolation; they must be spatially integrated and connected across permeable and dynamic landscapes to play their part in the broader economic land use. There is also growing global understanding of the need to link parks to development sectors, including agriculture, water, health and rural development. Kristal Maze, a participant from the South African National Biodiversity Institute, made a convincing case for why parks and development go hand in hand when she spoke about the value of protected areas to water security. 60% of the Cape\u2019s drinking water and 100% of Cape Town\u2019s water comes from protected ecosystems. South Africa is now integrating parks into its national water plans. Given that nearly a third of the world\u2019s 100 largest cities depend on protected areas for part of their drinking water, (pdf) other countries may want to follow suit. Many countries struggling to tackle development challenges should take a cue from the Comoros and integrate parks into their development plans. Within four years, Comoros will have increased its protected area estate tenfold and will have forged a more secure path towards sustainable development by grounding growth in the protection of nature. Now that\u2019s a promising future.

Run away.          \u201cOnce upon a time,\u201d I intoned, half sleep, \u201cthere was a very naughty boy called Charlie, and one day, he RAN AWAY\u2026 then what?\u201d \u201cLions,\u201d she\u2019d say. Or \u201cA French whale\u201d. Or \u201cVenice.\u201d For her eighth birthday, I asked what she would like. \u201cWrite down the Charlie stories,\u201d she said. Of course we had forgotten them, so we started again, with more shall we say narrative arc, and an actual plot. I thought she meant \u201cwrite them down so we don\u2019t forget them\u201d; but when I\u2019d written them, with her leaning over my shoulder, correcting my spelling, dictating developments, yelling, and so forth, and I said \u201cNow what?\u201d, she said: \u201cSend it to Derek\u201d. Derek was my agent, and she was old enough to know that when you finish writing something you send it to Derek. And Derek, who was expecting the love/death/alcohol/Rachmaninoff novel, rose gallantly to the small boy who can talk to cats, runs away with the floating circus and gangs up with captive lions to save the world novel, complete with French whale, and Venice. We called it Lionboy, and wrote sequels, and further novels, and Derek and his colleagues sold it in 36 languages, at least partly because someone called us the New JK Rowling, and several people exaggerated how much we were paid. An Australian paper said Isabel dictated it to me; an English one said I invented her contribution as a publicity stunt. We found ourselves in Japan and Argentina, Holland and Bangkok. Isabel learned the Catalan for \u201cWhat is this obsession with Harry Potter?\u201d Now my co-author is finishing up at university, and I am back where I belong writing for adults, about the history of maxillofacial reconstructive surgery, and love and death and alcohol and Rachmaninoff and post-traumatic stress disorder. I will say, writing five novels in the comparative privacy of children\u2019s fiction certainly honed my abilities. And Isabel is still, and always, my first reader. Isabel (Louisa\u2019s daughter) Just when I thought I, and Lionboy\u2019s readers, had grown up and moved on, a new incarnation of our beautiful old adventure is growing under new inventors. The theatre company Complicite has created a stage show: Marcelo dos Santos wrote the script, Clive Mendus and James Yeatman directed the revival, Annabel Arden\u2019s magnificent talent created the original show last year. These living, magical people are acting out what we\u2019d only ever seen in our minds\u2019 eye. When I was little, Charlie Ashanti was my alter-ego and we\u2019d go adventuring as one: now, I\u2019m going to meet Charlie at the Tricycle Theatre, and we\u2019ll get to know each other. It\u2019s pretty strange.     Isabel Adomakoh Young: It\u2019s pretty strange to see living, magical people acting out what we\u2019ve only ever seen in our minds\u2019 eye. Photograph: Mark Douet    It was special, too, to have made the stories we\u2019d concocted at my bedside into something for children across the world. Sometimes when we went abroad, kids recognised us and came up clutching well-thumbed copies. Aged 10, I couldn\u2019t quite get my head around the role reversal, given how I followed Philip Pullman and Jaqueline Wilson around our publishers\u2019 parties. It was the loveliest thought, that these kids were sharing the mad world inside our heads. People often ask how the actual writing process worked: as I remember, we\u2019d discuss the story in the park or on the way to school, and then mum would write it. Then I\u2019d read what she\u2019d done and say, \u201cthat won\u2019t be funny for kids\u201d or \u201cwhat does that mean?\u201d or \u201cplease don\u2019t kill Primo!\u201d - as well as \u201coh wow\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s brilliant!\u201d I hadn\u2019t read mum\u2019s adult books \u2013 they were a bit beyond me \u2013 but as Lionboy came into being, I got to see her professional side. The buzz around Lionboy generated some truly surreal moments. When we signed the initial contract, they sent a guy dressed as a lion to our house with a hamper of Lion bars, which made us laugh! And I always look back fondly on our visit to Japan, which included \u201cintelligent\u201d toilets like in that episode of The Simpsons, and strawberries-and-cream sandwiches, which were a kind attempt to make us feel at home \u2013 what two things do Brits eat, after all? I hope the lasting legacy of Lionboy will be a love of nature and an instinct to care for Earth. That kind of concern was intrinsic to the plot, and now seems all the more important. The books, set in a potential near-future, involve big pharma, animal welfare and climate issues, which grow more pressing by the day. I hope the kids that loved Lionboy will be motivated to help save our lovely planet, and that they\u2019ll love the adventure too. The Lionboy books are available from the Guardian bookshop. Louisa\u2019s most recent novels for adults are My Dear I Wanted to Tell You and The Heroes\u2019 Welcome.

The Virgin franchise is already epitomized by \u201cperky\u201d \u2013 at least the airline elements of it are, as Virgin Trains, cleaving through Britain along the West Coast Main Line, is a more foreboding experience \u2013 and, of course, there is no more perky way to travel that cruise liners. \u201cCruise ship entertainment\u201d \u2013 long the insult of choice for such purveyors of sophistication as Simon Cowell \u2013 is perfectly suited to Branson\u2019s existing style, and \u201cVirgin Cruises\u201d the perfect marriage of that style with a mode of delivery. You can see the reality show, already, right? The clich\u00e9d idea of life onboard \u2013 all struggling entertainers and group-home type activities \u2013 is not, apparently, what Branson is aiming for. In the publicity material for the enterprise, which is still five years from launch, the emphasis is on a classy experience, with the Virgin fleet apparently drawing on \u201cdowntown Manhattan and SoHo\u201d for inspiration.  His inspiration raises certain questions. Which bit of downtown Manhattan? Broadway on a Saturday afternoon a week before Christmas? The Lower East Side on garbage day? Murray Hill during Santacon? At sea for two weeks with a bunch of vomiting hipsters and suddenly the back end of Virgin economy on a full flight from Bangkok starts to look like an ideal way to travel. What Branson means, obviously, is the SoHo of our Hollywood-based dreams, some 1990s version of a loft experience in which people mill about drinking cocktails and exchanging bon mots. It\u2019s an empty and increasingly outdated marketing ploy, like those terrible bars in London named after New York neighbourhoods \u2013 or worse, the yuppie apartment complex currently going up in Tottenham, north London, in which the units are called things like Tribeca and Bushwick. (Seven Sisters is many things, none of them to do with artists\u2019 lofts in New York). On the other hand, cruise ships are about a fantasy anyway, so if you\u2019re willing to buy into it, fair enough. What makes going on a cruise heinous to the rest of us is that which actively appeals to its fans: the fact that while you\u2019re at sea, you exist in a state of suspended animation, outside the usual parameters of space and time. Things happen on cruise ships. They are the perfect locations for a novel, or a murder. And Branson\u2019s ability to ride certain cultural waves suggests that cruise travel might be due for a resurgence. In spite of the recent drop in oil prices, airline fares haven\u2019t fallen at all and the holiday season is about to remind us how hideous the airport experience can be.  For instance, for about two minutes earlier this year, I actually thought about taking the Queen Mary back to London next summer as an alternative to wrestling two babies through airport security. Then I shuddered and came to my senses because, 10 years ago, I took the QE2 from Southampton to a docking area off the coast of Scotland (for work, not for fun). It was like a floating old age home, fraying at the edges, and totally skewed towards the American market. I remember being put out that they served pancakes and syrup rather than baked beans at breakfast. Oh, and like a holiday camp you can\u2019t escape from \u2013 or a social experiment designed specifically to mess with English people \u2013 if you entered the dining room alone, they made you sit at a table with somebody else and have a conversation. My dining companion was a convivial, elderly lady, who thought the ship would be nicer, she said. But now, enter, Branson! If the entrepreneur is good at anything, it\u2019s overcoming public relations disasters \u2013 and he will have his work cut out for him with the cruise industry. It has suffered one catastrophe after another in the last few years, from the capsizing of the Costa Concordia, to repeat outbreaks of the Norovirus, to the news this week that cruise ships are breeding grounds for sexually transmitted diseases. (Patrons are now advised to bring their own prophylactics.) On the upside, Virgin cabin crews, frustrated entertainers all, will finally have an official venue for their talents, over on-stage at Virgin Cruises. And whatever else you say about cruise liners, they do permit guests to get away from it all - even if it is via an interior journey brought on by vomiting and delirium.", "publicationDate": "2014-12-17T12:51:33Z", "tags": ["Cruises", "Richard Branson", "Virgin Group", "Travel & leisure"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/emma-brockes-column/2014/dec/17/virgins-new-cruises-inspired-lower-manhattan-warning", "title": "Virgin's new cruises are inspired by lower Manhattan.

The man had not realised that opening the door was dangerous, staff members said. The safety scare on Sunday came days after a passenger on another domestic flight opened the emergency exit moments after his plane landed - deploying the shute - saying that he was in a hurry to get off. There is growing concern in China that the behaviour of travellers, particularly those venturing overseas, is damaging the image of the country.  An AirAsia flight from Bangkok to Nanjing had to return to Thailand last week after an angry Chinese passenger threw scalding water at a flight attendant.  But Sunday\u2019s incident, on a Xiamen Air flight from Hangzhou to Chengdu, seems to have been an innocent mistake by a first-time flier. Startled fellow passengers took shots of the incident on their mobile phones, later posting them on social media.  \u201cI have been flying so many years, and it is the first time that I\u2019ve seen someone open the emergency exit,\u201d one wrote, according to the Zhejiang Online website. No slide was used because the door was above a wing on the Boeing 737-800 and maintenance workers were able to fix the problem in time for the flight to take off punctually.  \u201cIt was the first time he had flown,\u201d an airline press officer told the Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper.  \u201cHe did not cause delays or any other direct losses to the airline.\u201d The spokesperson added: \u201cThere are warnings on the emergency exit and there are instructions on how to open the exit in case of emergency. However, the passenger didn\u2019t do it deliberately.\u201d The cabin crew explained the danger to the man, in his 50s, and changed his seat before the flight took off.  The airline has no authority to hand out punishment and did not ask the airport police to do so since the man had not done any damage and had not acted maliciously, the press officer added. It is unclear whether the man involved in last week\u2019s incident with the shute was punished. Staff at China Eastern Airlines told reporters that the incident on the Xi\u2019an to Sanya flight delayed the plane\u2019s next take-off by two hours.  An unnamed expert told the official China News Service that the airline might also have to spend over 100,000 yuan [\u00a310,340] checking and maintaining the emergency slide and cabin door.

I\u2019m in bed with my mother in a Thai sex hotel. It is my 30th birthday. How have things got so out of hand? To wind back a little, I hadn\u2019t been looking forward to a third decade. My father had died three years before, and I\u2019d responded with great resourcefulness, by having a comprehensive breakdown, ending a nurturing relationship and moving back home. I couldn\u2019t work, or go out, and didn\u2019t want to be seen. A life shrunk to four small walls was all that seemed manageable. I was watching The Lion King a lot, and doing all the voices. So when my mother announced that we were going to Australia and Thailand for Christmas, I was unresponsive. Having been in the UK since 1979, she had recently become a British citizen and wanted to celebrate by flying as far away from Britain as geographically possible. She wanted me to see the Great Barrier Reef, she said. I pictured men in shorts, throwing pigskins at my head. But I had no other plans. The Australian leg was \u2026 not good. I became extremely sick, which is my signature move. My mother, basically a toddler, had us pinballing between territories like they were rides at Alton Towers. In three weeks we flew from Perth to Cairns to Melbourne to Darwin. We spent about 40 minutes in Alice Springs. She was loving it; I was dragging the meat of my own carcass around. We went to Sydney for a single night, which I spent staring at a toilet bowl. In one airport I looked so rough they nearly didn\u2019t let me on the plane in case I had bird flu. The night before we left the country, my ex called me on a hotel lobby phone to tell me our dog had died. Like I said: not good. Still, there was everything to play for. Christmas in Thailand sounded like an idea from a \u201c30 things to do before you\u2019re 30\u201d peak-experience hit list, the ones that fixate on kayaking, taking ayahuasca on Machu Picchu, or inconveniencing dolphins in Cancun. However, those lists are aimed at sexy young couples who like house music, not a depressed 29-year-old and his elderly mother. Don\u2019t imagine beach huts or tinsel-strewn palm trees. Owing to a lack of online hut-booking facilities, and mobility issues, we were to spend the week sharing a Bangkok hotel room. You may have a dated, stereotypically seedy mental image accompanying the words \u201cBangkok hotel room\u201d. You\u2019d be correct. Instead of chocolates, they left condoms on the pillows of the bed. The bed which we were sharing. The \u201cdoor\u201d to the bathroom was a barely frosted glass slat, a saloon door to a nightmare. A week on a porn set was not how I\u2019d pictured becoming a man. At least, not like this. So there we were, Christmas morning in a Buddhist land, my birthday, no tinsel, surrounded by sex aids. The thing was, with nothing else to do, we sat in the room and talked. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time we had. Depression had left me uncommunicative, paralysed, angry with the world. There is so much shame attached to not being able to function, and I knew my life hadn\u2019t progressed. I was turning 30 having not realised any dreams. I felt small. Finally talking, it became clear none of that stuff mattered to her. I\u2019d done nothing in my whole life to make her proud, yet unfathomably, she was proud anyway. She\u2019d used her savings for us to be able to go away as far away as we could, to show me things, for me to be happy. And I asked her about her life, which I\u2019d never done, having always assumed I just emerged from a fog in the 1980s. She told me she\u2019d been born in a trench in Burma during the war. How her mother had suffered too much to bear, losing many children. How my mother raised her surviving siblings. How later, after the death of my father \u2013 her husband \u2013 she\u2019d not given up on life, and taught herself a new skill every year, conga drumming, sculpture, digital storytelling. We talked about what it means to surrender your Indian passport forever, and take a British one. I realised I came from somewhere, which is to say I realised I was alive. No one tells you the truth about adulthood, which is that you spend most of it missing people, and only a handful of moments last. Sometimes we have to force ourselves to not shut out the people we love, because they\u2019re all that keeps us here. I didn\u2019t transform. I can happily report I\u2019m still grumpy, ungrateful and complain a lot. But I started to understand, that Christmas. And I started to mend. Thanks, Mum. And Merry Christmas, everyone.

One of the favourites is chugging a glassful of the brine out of a jar of pickled gherkins. Apparently, the fermentation process creates digestive probiotics and the salt helps replace lost electrolytes. You can buy a big jar of Uncle Vanya-brand gherkins at Sedmoi Kontinent supermarkets all over Russia for 80 roubles (about \u00a31 and falling). Better still, take your own mug along to one of the babushkas selling pickled cucumbers from barrels in the farmers\u2019 market. Pickling things is a passion in Russia and involves salt, peppercorns, garlic cloves, dill and a dacha-load of magic optional extras, such as horseradish and blackcurrant leaves. Where to find it in the UK There\u2019s nothing to stop you glugging gherkin juice at home, but it\u2019s worth noting that \u201cpicklebacks\u201d (whisky followed by a shot of pickling brine) have become trendy in London bars. Pitt Cue Co in Soho, where a pickleback is \u00a34.50, makes its own pickle juice with cider vinegar, demerara sugar and aromatics such as fennel and mustard. The addition of star anise can help clear the head and soothe the stomach.Phoebe Taplin Pancita (tripe stew), Mexico      Pancita mondongo soup - a popular morning-after pick-me-up in Mexico. Photograph: Alamy    Let\u2019s face it, beer and mezcal don\u2019t mix well. After a heavy session of cantina hopping, Mexicans make a beeline for the nearest pancita stall. Pancita, also commonly known as menudo, is a rich, spicy soup made of beef tripe, slowly cooked in broth with tomatoes and chillies until buttery and tender. Famous as a remedy for la cruda \u2013 a hangover \u2013 it is served with optional onion, lime, chopped coriander and oregano sprinkled on top. Where to find it in the UKMexican food has finally come into its own in the UK, with restaurants such as the Wahaca chain across London and in Cardiff, and stalls selling authentic street food rather than the stodgy, American-style Tex-Mex. Savina in Liverpool and La Choza in Brighton consistently receive good reviews, too. Pancita doesn\u2019t feature on any of these menus, but a burrito stuffed with refried beans, rice, cheese and more is the sort of culinary ballast required after a big night out. Nick Gilman, author of Good Food in Mexico City  Leche de tigre, Peru     A boy sells servings of ceviche at Agua Dulce beach in Lima. Photograph: Enrique Castro-Mendivil/Reute    Leche de tigre (tiger\u2019s milk), the citrus-based marinade used in ceviche, Peru\u2019s national dish of raw fish, is said to cure all hangover ills. The name derives from its milky colour and energising properties. Containing lime juice, coriander, chillies, garlic, onion, salt and pepper, the Peruvian elixir can either be drunk as an invigorating aperitif, or poured over a hearty plate of ceviche. The piquant mix of spice and citrus juice is said to levantar muertos, \u201craise the dead\u201d. With a high concentration of raw herbs and vitamin C, tiger\u2019s milk is also said to be an aphrodisiac. A popular variation that is equally effective for a hangover is leche de pantera, panther\u2019s milk, which uses black clams, lending the marinade a dark hue. Where to find it in the UK In London, Peruvian restaurants Andina (1 Redchurch Street, Shoreditch) and Ceviche (17 Frith Street, Soho) don\u2019t do the marinade as a drink but both have a selection of ceviches on the menu. Classic ceviche is made from sea bass but alternative versions include beetroot, salmon and scallop (from \u00a35). To really chase away the effects of the night before, wash it down with a superfood smoothie from Andina \u2013 try the lucuma (a tropical fruit), kiwicha (a seed grain similar to quinoa), banana and hazelnut concoction called the Chaska. Kiki Deere Stick to fernet, Argentina  The polite way to describe fernet \u2013 a herbal Italian spirit \u2013 is as an acquired taste. But get beyond that bitter first sip and, some say, you\u2019ll be spared a nasty hangover. In Argentina, where it\u2019s hugely popular, that belief persists. (You might still suffer if you overdo it, the local lore goes, but you\u2019ll still feel better than a night on any other spirit.) In Buenos Aires, it\u2019s the party drink of choice, mixed with Coca-Cola and on the menu at any one of these top bars. In the country\u2019s second city, C\u00f3rdoba, it\u2019s as common as water. (Try the Fernet Club, Jacinto Rios 126) San Franciscans are also big fans. Fernet gained a footing in the city after masquerading as medicine to sneak through prohibition. A morning-after shot with a ginger-ale chaser is said to be a miracle cure.  Where to find it in the UK Fernet is cropping up on more and more cocktail menus, with chef Fergus Henderson singing its praises as an antidote to overindulgence. His Dr Henderson \u2013 mixed with an equal quantity of cr\u00e8me de menthe \u2013 could be the perfect hair-of-the-dog remedy for the season. Try it at his restaurant, St John in London\u2019s Clerkenwell, or mix it yourself.Vicky Baker Haejang soup, South Korea      Haejang Guk soup.  Photograph: @shuvramondal/Instagram    Potent stews for sobering up have ancient roots in Asia, and haejang guk, \u201csoup to chase away a hangover\u201d, is the contemporary Korean cure for one too many sips of soju. Ingredients for the potent stew vary from region to region and kitchen to kitchen, but most are composed of a bone-based broth enriched with napa cabbage, vegetables and congealed ox blood. When pork or beef bones are used, they are simmered until any remaining meat falls off the bone. The piping hot, meaty stew can be accompanied by noodles, rice, or rice cakes. In Seoul, soya-bean paste is often added; other regional variations might use soya beans, radishes and fish. Where to find it in the UKNew Malden in Surrey is home to the largest population of South Koreans in the UK, making it the place to find authentic Korean cuisine.  Su La (79-81 Kingston Road, 020 8336 0121) is one of the best local restaurants, and does a non-meat version of haejang soup. Katie Parla  Pork bones \u2018tea\u2019, Malaysia     The Malaysian stew of pork and herbal soup known as bak kut teh. Photograph: Alamy    Translated into English, bak kut teh hardly sounds the most appetising cure. Literally \u201cpork bones tea\u201d, it has nothing to do with a good old cuppa, but is actually another delicious, health-restoring Asian broth. Pork ribs are slow-braised in a clay pot for hours with a blend of weird and wonderful Chinese herbs and spices, from star anise, cinnamon, whole bulbs of garlic and ginseng to the invigorating radix astragali, a medicinal dried root. A huge bowl of the rich dark soup is accompanied by deep-fried tofu puffs and a thick, black soy dipping sauce with lethal chopped red chillies. Watch the locals and you\u2019ll see most order a side-dish of pork liver and tripe, too. It may not have the nightlife profile of Bangkok or Hong Kong, but Kuala Lumpur is a serious party city. Bak kut teh is served late at night through till early morning, and while some prefer to head off a hangover by ordering a bowl before going to bed, others wait till morning and choose their favourite stall for a breakfast pick-me-up. The Sun Hong restaurant (35 Medan Imbi) serves it from 5am to midday. Where to find it in the UK In London\u2019s Chinatown, it is served at the no-frills New Fook Lam Moon (10 Gerrard Street, 020 7734 7615). Good equivalents at one of the most popular restaurants in Manchester, Ning, are kari laksa or tom yam soup, both also soothing Asian comfort foods. John Brunton Ant tea, Australia      Green tree ants, Queensland - Australia\u2019s indigenous people know all about their properties as a hangover cure, and their nutritional benefits. Photograph: Alamy    Indigenous Australians have used natural remedies for thousands of years, and green ants have been the traditional go-to insect for headaches and colds, usually taken ground up in a tea \u2013 a sort of grub Lemsip. Take a bush walk in Kakadu national park in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory, and your guide may go a bit Crocodile Dundee, plucking a handful from a nest and simply chewing off the bottom half. A dip in the bone-cold Jim Jim Falls plunge pool, reached via a 2km walk through monsoon forest and over boulders, should work wonders, too. There\u2019s also the frisson-inducing possibility of what lurks beneath the surface, though the dangerous \u201csalties\u201d are downstream of here. Where to find it in the UKThis is a tricky one to recreate back home. \u201cAnts are notoriously hard to rear because of the complex societies they live in, which is why most of the ants eaten in Asia and South America are hunted, not farmed,\u201d says Shami Radia, co-founder of eatgrub.co.uk, which sells edible insects and hosts pop-up insect food \u201cevents\u201d. In the absence of ants, go for nutritionally rich crickets (they taste like nutty shrimps) \u2013 69% protein and high in iron and calcium. Alternatively, curl up on the sofa with a cup of tea and a packet of eatgrub\u2019s cricket nut fudge. Mmm.Lydia Bell Vodka for breakfast, Mongolia      A typical morning-after cure in the Gobi desert. Photograph: Alamy    Internet lore mystifyingly claims that Mongolians drink pickled sheep\u2019s eyes in tomato juice as a morning-after treatment. They don\u2019t. While Mongolia\u2019s notoriously mutton-dominated cuisine breathes new life into the concept of nose-to-tail eating, your average patriarch would blanch at anything as plant-based as tomato juice, opting instead for, well, more vodka. Be it the traditional mare\u2019s milk distillate the Chinese call \u201cMongolian liquor\u201d, or Russian-style vodkas, like Chinggis or Alta\u00ef, when it comes to alcohol, the typical rural Mongolian makes Poles, Icelanders and Koreans look like models of sobriety \u2013 so whatever is left from the night before is consumed in the morning. A couple of tea bowls of vodka will undoubtedly take the edge off even the gnarliest hangover, albeit only by delaying it until the second day\u2019s alcoholic glow gives way to the ultimate dark night of the soul. Where to find it in the UKIf you have arrived at the conclusion that you have the constitution of a Mongolian herder, go to Vodka Wodka (Ashton Lane) in Glasgow, which stocks more than 100 brands from 15 countries; Siberia Vodka Bar (Belmont Street) in Aberdeen; or Baltic bar (Blackfriars Road) in Southwark, London (60 varieties including horseradish and basil). Black Cow is a West Dorset-made milk vodka said to be inspired by an old Siberian recipe. It is available across the UK.Theodora Sutcliffe Coffee with a goose egg, Bali  Hangovers are almost de rigueur for tourists in Bali\u2019s Kuta party zone. Yet the women selling hangover cures very rarely attract a foreign customer. Their pick-me-up concoction of strong, sweet coffee, with a heavy dose of condensed milk, might be appealing enough ... but a raw goose egg dropped into it is, apparently, the ingredient that works the magic. There are no cafes selling kopi telur \u2013 just look out for the street vendors carrying oversized thermos flasks and a tray of equally oversized eggs. Where to find it in the UKCountless exotic treats have taken root in this country, but not kopi telur. For an alternative take on the Balinese hangover cure tuck into a plateful of Soto Ayam Besar, a spiced chicken broth topped with a boiled egg, at Krakatoa in York krakatoayork.com), then head home to make your own eggy coffee (a hen\u2019s egg is an acceptable substitute).

After that, it\u2019s out with the big guns \u2013 a full-fat meat feast, chargrilled over a braai, or barbecue. For urbanites, the coolest spots to brunch on steak, boerewors sausage and cold beer are township shisa nyama (grilled meat) joints such as Mzoli\u2019s in Gugulethu near Cape Town, Max\u2019s Lifestyle(maxslifestyle.co.za) in Umlazi near Durban, and Chaf Pozi (chafpozi.co.za) in Soweto, Johannesburg. Cheap, loud and smoky, they\u2019re great levellers, attracting a mix of locals and \u201cblack diamonds\u201d, members of South Africa\u2019s affluent black middle class. You choose some meat at the butcher\u2019s counter and wait for it to be delivered, sizzling, on a wooden board or enamel plate, with pap (maize porridge) and vitamin-rich chakalaka relish on the side.

Indonesia was the hardest hit, followed by Sri Lanka, India and Thailand. We\u2019ve asked readers who were affected by the tsunami to share their memories. For most their experiences of that day had life changing consequences.  Jaime Aldridge: \u201cI was 13 years old when I witnessed the tsunami ... mostly I felt guilty that I could get on a plane and escape the suffering\u201d Jaime wrote about her experiences on the plane on the way home: \u201cMe and my family were staying at a beach hut in Unawatuna, Sri Lanka for Christmas. On Boxing Day at 9:00am we planned to go on a snorkelling trip out at sea. We woke up at 8 and got on the boat at 9:10 which was incredibly lucky due to the experience ahead of us ... So we sailed out to sea in a fishing boat. We kept circling the island while the fisherman explained that the sea was too rough snorkel and was very dangerous. At this time we were getting a bit aggravated that we wouldn\u2019t be able to snorkel! At the bottom of the fishing boat was a small square of glass down into the sea. We kept looking in it, and every time it looked dark and sandy so we couldn\u2019t see through it.  \u201cMy aunt Becky was very sea sick at this time and wanted to get off the boat. The fishermen went to take us back to shore and the sea had become so rough it was swirling around like mini tornados. So the fishermen sailed us around the corner to another city called Galle, when we got closer, three fishing boats shot out of the mist shouting \u201cGO GO OUT TO SEA NOW, WAVE 100FT WAVE! GO!\u201d we hadn\u2019t a clue what was happening, but we took their advice anyway. We sat in a boat out at sea, with my aunt being sick, my mom worried, my dad laughing about the whole affair and my grandma was reassuring my aunt. We waited two hours for what we thought was just a rough sea. We glanced at our hut and the hotels on the beach and realized that it was all destroyed. Still at this point we did not realize the extent of the damage. We sailed towards the beach where TV\u2019s, tables and domestics (equipment) were in the sea. I caught a glimpse of something floating in the sea, and when we got closer we apprehended that it was a floating corpse of a baby and next to it an old man.

A man pulled me up onto a ledge and then we ran though a broken down restaurant to a plot of land where all the waiters were. We got to know the waiters very well during our stay, so they were concerned about us and were all glad to see us alive, as they had all suffered dramatic experiences on land. My family ran over to me, and we were all told to run up the street. I had no shoes because I left them in the room, so I was running bare foot until a kind middle-aged man, looked at my feet and gave me his own shoes. My mom and dad began to run and so did I. we still didn\u2019t know what had happened. We ran up the street where some locals stopped us and took us inside to eat and drink.  \u201cWe were sitting down in their yard, when tourists and locals began to run in horror. Another wave was coming. The people that were looking after us took us along an alley; to some trees with ropes which led up into a mountain; which we remained until the streets were safe. In the mountain were a few families and we were lucky to be up there ... we were told by passing tourists to go to the temple to get food ... after three hours of watching homeless, upset, missing, children and adults walk past, my dad and uncle went to find a safe hotel to stop the night in ... after that we went to visit our broken down Beach hut to try to find our things. I found some clothes of mine in the wreckage. My mom found her favourite picture and some of her clothes. Most things were destroyed, missing or 300 yards up the road. Everything was now getting a bit emotional and my mom began to cry as she looked at the damage that nature can do to our civilisation ...  \u201cWe were reported as missing on BBC. BBC said that a British teacher and his family were on a boat when went missing. This was us. My uncle is a British Council Teacher, so we had people looking for us ... We are extremely lucky to get away from the disaster than has killed thousands.\u201d Andy Chaggar: \u201cI lost the woman I loved ... as a result I\u2019ve spent virtually every day since trying to make the most out of life and do what I can to make a difference\u201d \u201cIn December of 2004 I travelled to the town of Khao Lak, in Thailand, with my partner Nova Mills. Nova and I had been together for almost six years and were about seven weeks into a planned one-year trip around the world. We\u2019d had a great time on our trip so far, having travelled through China, Vietnam and Cambodia, but we were really excited to meet up with three friends from home whom we met in Bangkok. We had a great few days catching up and then Christmas itself couldn\u2019t have been more perfect. We spent a lot of the day just relaxing on Khao Lak\u2019s Nang Thong beach talking, laughing a lot and keeping ourselves cool by taking regular dips in the ocean.      Andy Chaggar (centre) and Nova Mills on holiday in Cambodia, taken a few days before arriving in Khao Lak in December, 2004  Photograph: Andy Chaggar/GuardianWitness    Once the sun set we all took showers and then met in the restaurant of the guesthouse four of us were staying at. This was a very small family run place no more than 30 metres back from the beach and sadly I\u2019ve never been able to remember the name. We returned to the beach where we sat laughing and raising glasses until the very early hours. I think we finally made it to bed around 4am.  \u201cBecause of our late finish the night before we were still in bed the next morning when the tsunami reached Khao Lak. I remember waking up in our bungalow and Nova had just risen on the other side of the bed. The room was shaking and this became more violent as I tried to work out what was going on. Our bungalows were close to the beach but were perpendicular to the shore so we couldn\u2019t see the wave approaching. There was a noise however that I\u2019ve only ever been able to describe like a jet engine building up, and between that and the shaking we knew something was wrong. I made it to my feet and remember Nova on the other side of the bed looking scared. That was the last time I ever saw the woman I loved as the first wave then slammed into our bungalows.  \u201cWhen I came to again I was in the water. This may sound strange but at this point I didn\u2019t remember being in the bungalow moments before. The impact must have been so powerful that I was knocked unconscious and totally stunned. All I knew at this point was that I was in serious trouble. I was being swept along by the most powerful current I\u2019ve ever felt. The water was also full of debris. Wood, metal, glass, bricks and everything else you can think had turned the wave into a thick soup. Swimming was futile, it was like being in a giant washing machine full of nails on a spin cycle.      A Mercedes car submerged among debris in a pond of destroyed Khao Lak Laguna Resort by the tidal wave tsunami in Khao Lak south of Thailand. Taken on 3 Jnauary 2005 Photograph: Roslan Rahman/AFP/Getty Images    \u201cSomehow, luckily, I was washed through a building site, I think perhaps of a new resort being built. The structure had columns and floors but no walls as yet. As I was swept through my left leg became trapped against one of the columns and I was then pinned there by debris. I immediately felt excruciating pain and I lost a lot of tissue and muscle on my calf. But I think this saved my life as it stopped me being swept out to sea where I would likely have been killed. I was then trapped on this building site for around four hours. I was too injured to stand, let alone walk, and even sitting up was hard at times.  \u201cAs well as my left leg I\u2019d broken my right collarbone and had been pretty badly battered all over. At that point I had no idea what a tsunami was, let alone how big the larger event was, so I couldn\u2019t understand why official help wasn\u2019t coming. Various other survivors wandered into view at times but seemed too shocked to help. A group of locals arrived at one point and tried to help, but a second wave approached and they were forced to flee. Luckily I was trapped on a higher floor and the second wave passed underneath me.  \u201cEventually a small group of other westerners found me and helped me to the main road in Khao Lak. I was immediately put into a pick-up truck however so didn\u2019t get a chance to get their names or details. Over the next 10 days I was moved through various hospitals, some in the immediate area, but later onto Bangkok. I had three surgical operations in Thailand to debride the infected tissue on my leg and there was a lot of concerns about my injuries. However, after my immediate rescue my biggest pain was always in relation to Nova. The scene in the bungalow had come back to me by now, and after also seeing so many bodies in Khao Lak I was virtually certain she hadn\u2019t made it.  \u201cAfter being flown home to the UK, I spent seven weeks in hospital and then seven months doing physiotherapy. All I could think about through this time was where we were supposed to be on our trip and what we were supposed to be doing together. I knew I needed to find an outlet for my grief, and I\u2019d also been incredibly moved by seeing the devastation first hand in Thailand. So, when I felt able, I returned to Khao Lak in August 2005 and joined an organisation called the Tsunami Volunteer Centre (TVC). I almost immediately became project manager for the construction of 67 homes in the village of Tap Tawan, north of Khao Lak. I spent the next year as a volunteer and the process was incredibly important to my own recovery. Seeing how local people, who had often lost so much more than me - I still had a house, family, money, etc - were able to cope and begin to smile again helped to put my own situation in perspective. I was also massively inspired by the steady stream of international volunteers who came to help and who worked so hard day after day to help affected communities.      Andy Chaggar working in Haiti Photograph: Andy Chaggar/GuardianWitness    \u201cAs time progressed my personal interest in aid work became a professional one. So, I returned to the UK and obtained my masters in degree in International Development, with a focus on disaster recovery. I wrote my dissertation on community based disaster recovery in Thailand and was awarded the Andrew Lochhead Prize for International Development. After this I travelled to Peru after an earthquake where I again volunteered as a construction manager, although this time for sanitation projects. While in Peru I began speaking to some other long-term volunteers, many of whom who had also been in Thailand as well, about starting a charity ourselves. So, in late 2008 we co-founded International Disaster Volunteers (IDV).  \u201cIt was incredibly tough founding a charity at the start of the financial crisis. None of us had savings or wealthy contacts and it took us almost a year to raise the \u00a35,000 needed to register as a charity. However, by the end of 2009 we had charitable status and were ready to start overseas operations as the 2010 earthquake struck Haiti ... As the ten year anniversary of the tsunami approaches I\u2019m reflecting on my journey since and trying to raise awareness of IDV\u2019s work. Since IDV started we\u2019ve raised over \u00a3500,000 and supported the recovery of over 12,000 disaster survivors. It\u2019s been quite a journey, with some massive ups and downs. Ultimately though, it all comes down to that day in Khao Lak 10 years ago and my own personal experiences of disaster. I lost the woman I loved and was lucky to survive myself. As a result I\u2019ve spent virtually every day since trying to make the most out of life and do what I can to make a difference. After all, I know more than most that anything could happen tomorrow.\u201d UbudHighDotcom: \u201cThere was so much devastation that single images just didn\u2019t capture the enormous scale of the tragedy\u201d \u201cI was in Karnataka in West India when the tsunami hit, and went over to the southeast to see what had happened. I spent a week walking the beaches around Nagappatinam, which was very hard-hit.      This is what was left of a fishermen\u2019s village a couple of kilometres from Nagappatinam. I shot on 35mm film, and then stitched the panoramas up in Photoshop  Photograph: UbudHighDotCom/GuardianWitness    \u201cThis is what was left of a fishermen\u2019s village a couple of kilometres from Nagappatinam. I shot on 35mm film, and then stitched the panoramas up in Photoshop. There was so much devastation that single images just didn\u2019t capture the enormous scale of the tragedy. It was very hard to photograph - there was absolutely nothing aesthetic about any of it. A very ugly scene. I didn\u2019t go into the sea for two years after this - I kept thinking about all of the dead bodies washing around in it.\u201d Ian Woolverton: \u201cI remember feeling sick and utterly useless as I listened to his story then muttered a few words of condolence via a Red Cross translator\u201d \u201cI\u2019d done other humanitarian assignments for Red Cross but this was of a scale no-one had experienced. I\u2019m not embarrassed to say I was afraid and apprehensive that I would freeze and be unable to do my job of getting the message out about our response. Within days I was on a chopper from Medan on Sumatra, Indonesia to Banda Ache where I was met by an ICRC colleague. Our makeshift office was a car showroom. I was not there that often since I spent many weeks travelling all over Ache to places like Teunom and Meulaboh on the West coast, places that at the time had not been accessed by aid. I was amazed at the speed with which Red Cross established field hospitals in places that were incredibly difficult to access by road, a chopper was often the only way in. And of course I will always remember the \u200eterrible death and destruction. I remember telling Andrew North from the BBC that it was like an atom bomb had exploded, everything flat, featureless, pancaked. I remember sleeping on the cold hard concrete floor of a hospital in Meulaboh with a medical team from Japanese Red Cross, the BBC in tow.

For the hundreds who found refuge within their walls, the buildings lifesaving role has not been forgotten. Photograph: Greg Baker, File/AP    \u201cBut what I remember most of all is meeting survivor after surv\u200eivor who told me awful heart wrenching stories of loss and anguish, like Yassir, a bi-cycle salesman whose hand had slipped from his wife\u2019s as they were carried away by the waves. His wife was expecting their first child. Eventually he found his wife\u2019s body in a bus stop. Eyes glazed, he carried a haunted expression that I will never forget. I remember feeling sick and utterly useless as I listened to his story then muttered a few words of condolence via a Red Cross translator. Over the course of a month in Ache I heard stories like this over and over again. But I also got to see the work of Red Cross volunteers from all over Indonesia who came to help the people of Ache. I was in awe of these young volunteers who toiled long days in the fetid heat and humidity to \u200eretrieve bloated bodies from among the never-ending debris. I was privileged to witness the work of the Red Cross doctors and nurses who worked tirelessly night and day to help the tsunami survivors. My time in Ache changed me forever. I am so grateful to have\u200e witnessed the humanity in this terrible disaster and to have been among people whom sacrificed so much to help other people. It was a deeply humbling experience, one I will carry with me always.\u201d Ian Woolverton was the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies \u200eMedia Manager in Ache from December 2004 to Feb 2005. He is now Head of Media for Save the Children Australia Josie Breen: \u201cWhen the first reports came through nobody could get in touch but it was thought the networks were down\u201d \u201cA few of my family spent Christmas night at my Aunt\u2019s in Edinburgh. Her son Dominic had called earlier from his holiday on Ko Phi Phi (Thailand) with girlfriend Eileen to wish a happy Christmas, saying it was paradise there. When the first reports came through nobody could get in touch but it was thought the networks were down. There has since been footage of the terrible speed and size of the event, but at first it looked like something a strong, young couple would overcome and survive. They hadn\u2019t. The whole family misses him and will be remembering him, Eileen, and thinking of the thousands of others on the 10-year anniversary.\u201d Alinah Azadeh: \u201cI could not square the fact that I had finally given birth to her long awaited grandchild, and she had promptly disappeared\u201d \u201cMy daughter Delia, my first born, was three weeks old when we woke up on Boxing Day 2004. My mother, Parvin Rieu, who had been with me prior and through the birth - cooking delicious Iranian food and praying quietly in the corner - had managed with her partner, Reg, to get a last minute booking to Phuket for a recovery holiday over Christmas. We had spoken the day before and she had described the \u2018paradise\u2019 they were staying in.  \u201cThe first I knew something was up, was a call from my brother to say not to panic if I saw the news about a tidal wave in Asia, he had called her hotel, which was on a hill, and everyone was accounted for. A few hours later, he called again to say that, the hotel had informed him that there were in fact, a few people missing, - those who had been up early after the previous nights celebrations for a beach walk- and my mother and Reg were among them. As the hours dragged on, I sat there, breastfeeding Delia, and a feeling of dread and disbelief grew as we realized the extent of the disaster and the utter chaos that was unfolding in the wake of the Tsunami. We heard a few days later that Reg had been rescued and was later flown home. When he told me on the phone that there was no way my mother could have survived I simply did not believe him.      Alinah\u2019s mother, Parvin Rieu with her grand-daughter, Delia Photograph: Alinah Azadeh /GuardianWitness    \u201cEven when my brother flew out there to look over thousands of bodies in the temples that were temporary morgues and sent me an email saying there was no hope, I still held out for her turning up on some remote island, having nursed others back to life as I knew would be in her nature to do so. I could not square the fact that I had finally given birth to her long awaited grandchild , and she had promptly disappeared. We had talked so much about the role she would play in Delia\u2019s life and the miracle that having a new child in the family was to her. As it turns out, her body was found the following March, just after we held a memorial for her on what would have been her 69th birthday.  \u201cI am grateful that I have the image of her final moments, which Reg gave to me: they were out walking in the fresh morning air, and upon seeing the water being strangely swept out to sea, and the fish flapping around for air on the sand, she moved towards them and began picking them up and throwing them back into the sea. This is 100% my mother. She apparently got stung by a ray fish and when Reg asked her if she wanted to go back and get it seen to, she told him to go ahead, she would follow on. And then a wall of water hit and that was the last he saw of her. He re-emerged and was saved by grabbing hold of a large piece of wooden debris.   , a collection of 999 objects that represented a loss or an ending, and were ritually wrapped in cloth which donors then designed into a suspended installation in the form of a receding wave, in Bristol Museum and Art Gallery\" width=\"460\" height=\"331\" class=\"gu-image\" />  Alinah\u2019s mother\u2019s death inspired The Gifts (2010), a collection of 999 objects that represented a loss or an ending, and were ritually wrapped in cloth which donors then designed into a suspended installation in the form of a receding wave, in Bristol Museum and Art Gallery Photograph: Alinah Azadeh /GuardianWitness    \u201cI have to say that the loss of my mother, particularly coming so soon after the birth of my daughter, changed the kind of work I made forever ... the work became rooted in relationship with strangers and on very intimate themes. The best known of these, which involved hundreds of members of the public in its production, was The Gifts (2010), a collection of 999 objects given to me that represented a loss or an ending, and were ritually wrapped in cloth with donors then designed into a suspended installation in the form of a receding wave, in Bristol Museum and Art Gallery. The conversations I had with donors to this project, on death, loss , longing, were transformative and brought me to a new understanding as to how art is like a language I have been given in order to face, transform and share a different kind of response to the suffering both I and thousands of others (in far worse situations) have had to go through.  \u201cShe (my mother) sometimes still appears in dreams and I have the enduring and almost incomprehensible memory of recalling a dream she shared with the four of us (her children) at a family meal in the September prior to the Tsunami that she had had the previous night. She has dreamt she was on a beautiful sandy beach, in the sun, and a huge wave came and swept her away. She looked at us and said, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t that be a beautiful way to die? You\u2019re already in heaven, its quick, no long illnesses \u2026\u2019. On some level I like to imagine this was her chosen path out of this world. On others, I still mourn for the loss of a mother who left us too young, and for the devastation of so many, many lives \u2013 and livelihoods. It is the process of holding these two spaces psychologically that has lead me into a deeper relationship with life, love and loss. And for that I am grateful.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2014-12-26T12:00:02Z", "tags": ["Indian Ocean tsunami 2004", "Natural disasters and extreme weather"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/dec/26/-sp-boxing-day-indian-ocean-tsunami-readers-memories", "title": "Boxing Day tsunami - readers' memories", "sentences": ["We\u2019d had a great time on our trip so far, having travelled through China, Vietnam and Cambodia, but we were really excited to meet up with three friends from home whom we met in Bangkok.", "Over the next 10 days I was moved through various hospitals, some in the immediate area, but later onto Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Driving through the congestion of Pattaya on the Gulf of Thailand I get the feeling that we\u2019re in one of the least likely places in the world to find a hippified festival with a focus on sustainability and personal responsibility. With its dubious reputation as one of the sex tourism capitals of the world, the Green Fields at Glastonbury it is definitely not. But after an hour of bumper-to-bumper traffic on the slow-moving highway out of the city, something along those lines is exactly what we find. In the lush and bucolic countryside of the Siam country park, Wonderfruit is in it\u2019s inaugural year and bringing a new flavour to the backpacker heartland of south-east Asia. Walking through the palm tree-lined entrance to the site, I feel like I could be walking on the manicured lawns of California\u2019s upmarket Coachella festival. When we reach the festival\u2019s main hub I get an overwhelming sense of familiarity. The festival\u2019s pop-up structures and hay-bale seating recall the scenery of one of the UK\u2019s many boutique festivals, which makes sense as Wonderfruit is a collaboration with Secret Productions, the people who previously ran Secret Garden Party and now run Wilderness, two of the festivals responsible for shifting the focus from lineup to overall experience in the UK. While the UK festival model has spread through the world, festivals taking place in countries such as Croatia can often have a \u201cBrits abroad\u201d feel with promoters making little or no concession to local culture or a local audience. But at Wonderfruit, there\u2019s an appetite for collaboration and exchange between the two cultures, with the likes of the Paradise Bangkok Molam International Band and Thai architect Duangrit Bunnag sharing equal billing with a strong international lineup that includes De La Soul and Woodkid.     Festivalgoers at the Soi stage    The seed for Wonderfruit was planted when event co-organiser Pete Phornprapha attended Secret Garden Party in 2012. Never having camped at a festival before, he quickly fell in love with the event and decided he would like to introduce his country to the concept of a \u201clifestyle festival\u201d. A plan was hatched with Secret Productions\u2019 Jo Vidler to host the event with less than a year to plan. At 3pm on day one of the festival, there\u2019s the buzz of last-minute preparations on site. We wander to The Quarry, the dance music arena on the edge of the site that will host two of the world\u2019s biggest DJs and Secret Garden Party regulars, Jamie Jones and Seth Troxler that night. Girls hang giant lanterns on the sunken venue\u2019s jutting bamboo roof between chats about their travels to Nepal and India. \u201cThis was all meant to arrive on Monday but got stuck in a shipping container for five days,\u201d we\u2019re told by one before being quickly enlisted to hold stepladders steady. At around 5pm, as the festival starts to fill up with Indian headdress-wearing UK festival regulars and Bangkok hipsters, we watch Yellow Fang on the festival\u2019s Soi Stage. A female three-piece from Bangkok, reminiscent of the Cocteau Twins with their sweet harmonies, they provide the perfect accompaniment to the sunset.     Play time \u2026 The festival\u2019s childrens\u2019 area    One of Wonderfruit\u2019s major selling points is its focus on sustainability and self-sufficiency in a part of the world not renowned for its green policies. There\u2019s the organic farm, which is already providing crops for some of the food stall holders, and the water filtration system that allows festivalgoers to refill biodegradable corn starch bottles throughout the weekend. The plan, organiser Jo Vidler tells me, is to be self-sufficient within five years. By day the festival has a laid-back, family-orientated atmosphere, magnified by the fact it has purposely started small this year with around 5,000 people on a site capable of hosting over 20,000, but at night an air of debauchery creeps in. Hercules and Love Affair bring their brand of exuberant camp New York house to the Living Stage before the crowd filters in to the smaller venues for the night. We wander over to Maggie Choo\u2019s bar, a spin-off from the carnivalesque Bangkok club of the same name where a bikini-clad dancer is joined by two dwarves for a burlesque-style routine. We sip on strawberry mojitos out of necessity. The fact that the festival has already run out of beer before midnight on the first day is a telling sign that the Thai organisers may have underestimated a festival crowd\u2019s appetites. After the majority of the festival spends the wee hours at The Quarry, Saturday means either lounging around on lilos in the on-site lake or pulling seemingly impossible yoga poses at the Goddess Camp. At 8pm we go to one of the feasts where for 2,000 baht (around \u00a340) we gorge on suckling pig and shaved raw asparagus salads cooked by Paolo Vitaletti, the Italian owner of Bangkok restaurant Appia. The lambs\u2019 liver skewers, cooked over a fire pit is possibly the most tender meat I have ever eaten. By Sunday afternoon, the sense of unity that can only be conjured by a couple of nights\u2019 bad sleep and a few unforgettable days has fallen over the festival. We watch an enchantingly intimate set from Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez, before rounding things off with an incendiary set from Gaslamp Killer on the Soi Stage, his 10-minute diversion into the molam music of north-east Thailand met with ecstatic cheers. \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure if Asia was ready for a festival like this,\u201d says Jo Vidler. Wonder no longer. \u2022 Tickets for the 2014 festival cost \u00a3100, including entrance, access to all facilities and camping pitch. Dates and prices for Wonderfruit 2015 have yet to be confirmed.
