Whether you\u2019re pro or con boils down to this: over 30, \u201cno food on Earth is worth waiting in line for unless I\u2019m staring starvation in the face\u201d; under 30, \u201cI\u00a0might get lucky in the queue.\u201d There are no prizes for guessing which camp I\u2019m in as I trudge disconsolately towards London\u2019s hottest new opening, the aptly-named Smoking Goat. We take one look at the seething mass of skinny-jeaned humanity jostling for a handful of seats in this loud, dark dive bar and think, bugger this for a lark. Then I\u00a0remember something: another new place a stagger away is deliberately, archly \u201creservations only\u201d. A phone call later and we\u2019re on our way. There\u2019s nothing to announce Old Tom &amp; English\u2019s presence, other than a vast, gleaming brass doorbell \u2013 so speakeasy. But I\u2019m confused: where\u2019s the restaurant? This subterranean joint, designed by Lee Broom (the man responsible for the semi-iconic Crystal Bulb), looks like a bar. We eat cockle popcorn with salt and vinegar: impossible to dislike, but you could probably deep-fry fingernails, douse \u2019em in salt and vinegar and they\u2019d go nicely with a cocktail. And\u00a0kale and burnt apple salad, the fruit bullied to invisibility by the brassica. And smoked confit guinea fowl, its skin papery and crisp, its flesh tender and smoky; anchovy mayo is perhaps an umami blast too far. There are scallops, complete with coral, courgette puree and cubelets of black pudding \u2013 a forgettable, vanilla dish. Most of all, though, there are martinis. Bone-dry icy martinis, as good as you\u2019ll get, the silver bullets of legend. We have three each. With its witty, 20th-century-modern feel, Old Tom &amp; English (the\u00a0name references a classic gin, apparently) is a seductive hangout. I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s so keen to insist it\u2019s a restaurant when really it\u2019s a fine addition to Soho\u2019s canon of\u00a0louche drinking dens. It just serves better bar snacks. Around 10pm, martini wisdom suddenly dictates there might be no\u00a0queue at Smoking Goat, so off we barrel. The\u00a0martinis are right, too: we get a table instantly. You might think it\u2019s reprehensible to review after several strong ones, but you\u2019d be wrong: Smoking Goat serves the ultimate pisshead food, bashing its way through the booze with a mighty mallet of heat and fat, spice and salt and smoke. There\u2019s nothing subtle, nothing requiring a finely-tuned palate. The vinyl soundtrack is grungy and loud, as are the hooting, cocktail-glugging gals propping up the bar. I may or may not be imagining the ossified puffer fish dangling from the ceiling. The menu is super-brief, so we have most of it apart from whole crab, which might be beyond our current motor skills. We\u2019re soon up to our elbows in vast slabs of meat: pork belly fragrant with five spice, and lamb ribs fresh from the sparking wood-fired barbecue, tearing off strips with greasy fingers and slurping them through sauces sharp with lime and fish sauce and belligerent with vicious little scuds. What a blast. Som tam is\u00a0indifferent, the papaya needing to be more finely shredded and muddled properly to marry the sour-sweet-fiery flavours, but sticky rice, delivered in little plastic bags, is all cloy and bite, and perfect for sponging up sticky juices. It\u2019s mostly more like northern Thai street food than anything you\u2019d\u00a0find in the restaurants of Bangkok, but fish sauce chicken wings point to Portland\u2019s food hero Andy Ricker and his Pok Pok, and owe more to Vietnam than to Thailand. They\u2019re very similar to Ricker\u2019s, with their crackly, caramelised exterior (crisp from rice\u00a0flour and pungent with garlic and fish sauce), and steaming, succulent, salty flesh. We get into woozy conversation with the cool young guys at the next\u00a0table; one turns out to be a\u00a0chef\u00a0at Som Saa, London\u2019s other rock\u2019n\u2019roll Thai BBQ. They leave shortly afterwards, probably grossed out by our grins, Shane McGowan-esque thanks to brutally adherent chunks of carbonised lamb fat. The food at Smoking Goat isn\u2019t finger-licking good, it\u2019s fist-and-wrist-and-possibly-elbow-and-knee-licking good. So here\u2019s my advice for dealing with the whole\u00a0reservations minefield: have\u00a0two dinners.

When people say chuzos, they think about 79th Street.\u201d (A chuzo is Colombia\u2019s answer to the kebab.) On the internet, however, Los Chuzos \u2013 a 24-year-old grilled meat and fresh juice counter owned by Casta\u00f1o\u2019s brother \u2013 wears a cloak of modern anonymity: it\u2019s not on Google Maps. The same is true of J&amp;C Delicias, a Colombian restaurant a few steps down 79th Street, and Jeri\u2019s Shim Myung Do, a martial arts school one block east. Olympya Beauty Salon, on Roosevelt off 78th Street, doesn\u2019t have any internet footprint at all. This neighbourhood, Jackson Heights, is a place where the commercial landscape confounds the vast reach of internet cartography. Many regular storefront businesses on Roosevelt Avenue are hard or impossible to find online. The challenge increases for the tax advisers, lawyers and medical professionals on the second or third floors. It goes without saying that any off-the-books establishment, from a taco cart or a sidewalk clothier to the truly illegal trades like drugs and prostitution, leaves little trace on the web. This divergence would have been unremarkable only a few years ago. But in that time, the internet\u2019s geospatial resources, or the \u201cgeoweb\u201d, have developed enough intricacy, sophistication and responsiveness to become an indispensable consumer tool. Just as, in an earlier generation of the internet, Craigslist obliterated the utility of printed classified ads, so the geoweb has supplanted road maps, restaurant guides and the Yellow Pages. Whether you want a pizza or a plumber, your search likely begins on a keyboard or touchscreen. In short, we now use the geoweb as though it were a perfect reflection of our world: 97% of US internet users, according to Google, look for local products and services online. A closer look, though, reveals that our digital mirror bears chinks and subtle distortions. Some businesses exploit loopholes to advance their virtual prominence. Others are obscured through their own ignorance. Still others don\u2019t appear on the internet at all.  That information bias permeates the internet is not news, of course. The amount of indexed Google Maps content per person is as much as 100 times greater in Scandinavia than in the Middle East or Central America; Tokyo has more geospatial data than Africa.     A busy retail street in Accra, Ghana. There is more geospatial digital data available for the city of Tokyo than for all of Africa. Photograph: Ulrich Doering/Alamy    But this effect is also evident within a city. Search Paris under Yelp\u2019s \u201chotwords\u201d program for brasserie, and you\u2019ll fine a virtual absence of the word in peripheral residential neighbourhoods like the 15th and 20th arrondissements. Google reveals those neighbourhoods to be as flush with steak-frites as any \u2013 but gourmands aren\u2019t writing about them online. Even in places where companies like Yelp, Bing and Google portray the commercial streetscape with perfect precision, search results are shaped by algorithms; the geoweb responds to each query with a fresh and limited permutation from its index. A husband and wife can receive different suggestions for Chinese food based not only on their choice of search engine, but their own search history. In effect, they see two different cities \u2013 try it with a friend! \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a true map,\u201d says Mark Graham, a senior research fellow at Oxford Internet Institute. \u201cEvery single map is a misrepresentation of the world, every single map is partial, every single map is selective. And every single map tells a particular story from a particular perspective.\u201d Because online maps are in constant flux, though, it\u2019s hard to plumb the bias in the cartography. Graham has found that the language of a Google search shapes the results, producing different interpretations of Bangkok and Tel Aviv for different residents. \u201cThe biggest problem is that we don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything we\u2019re getting is filtered through Google\u2019s black box, and it\u2019s having a huge impact not just on what we know, but where we go, and how we move through a city.\u201d As an example of the mapmaker\u2019s authority, Matt Zook, a collaborator of Graham\u2019s who teaches at the University of Kentucky, demonstrated what happens when you perform a Google search for abortion: you\u2019re led not just to abortion clinics and services but to organisations that campaign against it. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge power within Google Maps to just make some things visible and some things less visible,\u201d he notes. Last year, Google researchers found that only 55% of small businesses in the US had a website, while 19% had no online presence at all. With its new platform Google My Business, the company hopes to make it easier for small businesses to establish themselves online. Claiming or adding an online business listing is as simple as searching for it and verifying by phone or post.  \u201cBusinesses who are in big cities sometimes think that they can get most of their business from foot traffic, that their customer will walk past the store every day,\u201d says James Croom, head of marketing for Google My Business. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to a lot of them, and sometimes their view is, \u2018Well, actually, I don\u2019t need a website. I don\u2019t need to get online because people just walk down the street and find me.\u201d  The data in the large says otherwise. The 97% of internet users who search for local shops and services are acting on the results. Three-quarters of mobile searches trigger \u201cfollow-up actions\u201d like more research, a phone call or a visit \u2014 two per search, on average. Fully half of smartphone users visit a store within a day of their search (on PCs and tablets, it\u2019s slightly over a third). \u201cEffectively, every consumer \u2013 especially in urban areas \u2013 is using digital search to find businesses,\u201d says Damian Rollison, a vice president at Universal Business Listing, a company that helps small businesses increase their online presence. Failure in the digital realm can beget real-world losses. In Virginia, a former restaurateur who doesn\u2019t own a computer sued Google, unsuccessfully, after discovering that his listing had mistakenly said he was closed on the weekends. That restaurant, the Serbian Crown, closed last year \u2013 a victim of online sabotage, its owner insists, a claim that was in no way substantiated by the judge. Because a business can live or die on the strength of its digital footprint, a whole industry has emerged to offer what\u2019s called \u201clocal search engine optimisation\u201d. SEO Works, an Australian company, charges $1,990 (\u00a31,315) for a four-week \u201cGoogle Maps package,\u201d with a subsequent maintenance plan for $1,190 (\u00a3787). There are simpler options, too: the start-up Moz Local will maintain an online listing for $84 (\u00a355) a year, updating basic information such as opening hours on Google or Yelp. (For the record, it is free for businesses to claim and tend these listings themselves \u2013 and just as easy on Yelp or Apple as on Google.) As the influence of the geoweb grows, so does its appeal to transgressors. In January 2014, someone hijacked thousands of local hotel listings, redirecting them to the hotel-booking website Roomstobook.info (and two others with similar names). Companies like charter buses, teeth whiteners, cosmetic surgeons and strip clubs caught posting fake reviews have settled with state governments for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Certain industries have particularly low reputations. Local lawyers have proved notorious for hijacking local searches, providing misleading information to increase their digital prominence. \u201cIf you dig into these results what you\u2019ll find is that half of them have fake names and a third of them aren\u2019t really located where they say they are,\u201d says Mike Blumenthal, a local SEO consultant.  Abusive florists were weeded out, while the locksmith industry was an offender on such a scale that at one point, Rollison says, Google banned the keyword \u201clocksmith\u201d. In early 2009, there were so many fake listings (linked, in turn, to just a few telephone numbers) that midtown-Manhattan appeared to be home to nearly a thousand locksmiths \u2013 20 shops on one block of 34th Street alone.     Greenwich locksmiths. Photograph: Scott Lynch/FlickrVision    Consultants spend their days probing search algorithms to maximise their customers\u2019 exposure. But the blend of factors in a local search, on the side of both supply (quality of reviews, accuracy of a listing) and demand (geographic proximity, search history), make it a formidable field of study.  And what of those businesses, such as the Exotic Hair Salon on 76th Street off Roosevelt Avenue, that are completely digitally invisible? The owners and stylists, a pair of immigrants from Colombia and Honduras, did not seem perturbed by this state of affairs, and why should they be? The shop is busy, their customers are regulars, and they come in every week. You could perceive this part of Queens, then, as the muddled frontier of technology\u2019s domain. And perhaps the slow adoption of internet business strategies here isn\u2019t a sign of the weakness of virtual connections, but the strength of real-world ties: routine, word-of-mouth referrals, friendship, proximity, street presence, and so on.  Besides, it\u2019s not as if owners and customers here live in the recent past, finding their way on pocket street guides. Carlos Casta\u00f1a, the manager of Los Chuzos, hasn\u2019t gotten around to setting up a website for the restaurant \u2013 but he has no illusions about the influence of the virtual world. \u201cEverything happens on here,\u201d he said, holding up his iPhone. Except, perhaps, finding a place to have lunch.  This article was amended on 8 January 2015. An earlier version stated that listings can only be verified on Google Maps by post, and that the Serbian Crown\u2019s lawsuit was ongoing.

That\u2019s why we have come here.\u201d I am standing outside a shopping mall on the outskirts of Istanbul trying to gee up my 13-year-old daughter. We are about to go to KidZania, a new kind of theme park for children from four to 14. We have been flown out to Turkey and driven over the Bosphorous to see the reality of a city built for children. Soon another KidZania will open at the Westfield shopping mall in London. There has been much burble about this innovative kind of children\u2019s entertainment. It\u2019s a theme park with no rides, where you learn stuff. Or as the bumph says: \u201cKidZania London will be the UK\u2019s first educational entertainment experience, offering kids the opportunity to learn over 60 unique and exciting professions \u2013 turning dreams into reality.\u201d Dreams versus reality. All kids dream of being adults. All adults dream of time off from their kids. And there is gold in them there dreams. The London KidZania will simply be a version of this one in Istanbul. Or we could be in Lisbon or Dubai or Jakarta or Tokyo. For KidZania is a monumentally successful global concept called \u201cedutainment\u201d. There is nothing you cannot sell to parents, it seems to me, as long as you say it is somehow \u201ceducational\u201d. Unlike the average theme park full of rides, thrills and junk food, this one operates as a mini-city for children, where they go and work. Yes, work. They can be a fireman or a doctor or a TV presenter or a model or a cashier. They are paid in kidZos, KidZania\u2019s own currency, which they can save in the KidZania bank or spend on crap in the KidZania shop. It is like Lilliput refashioned by JG Ballard.     Children at work: a view of KidZania in Tokyo. Photograph: Kiyoshi Ota/Getty Images    We check in via a pretend airline desk and are tagged with bracelets. Theoretically parents go off and let their children navigate this simulacrum of a city state, which looks more like a shopping centre than a city. We wander around as A goes to the bank to get her money for the jobs she will pay to do. \u201cPilot,\u201d I say in a fake wave of enthusiasm. She duly dons a jacket and a cap and a weird hairnet \u2013 they are big on weird hairnets \u2013 and has a go on a flight simulator, which is basically an unsophisticated arcade game. Some smaller children run round excitedly, nabbing the best jobs. The little boys want to be firemen. They sit in line watching fire safety videos, again with hairnets, worn under their helmets. They get in a fire engine when the alarm goes off and are driven about by adults, herded off the cart and instructed to spray real water at pretend flames. They like it. They are seven. Why not? But there is no autonomy. And every child is shadowed by a parent filming them. There really is no need for tagging kids for safety these days \u2013 the law of modern parenting is that you must film your child having \u201cfun\u201d 24/7. Perhaps English parents will be less hands-on than Turkish ones, but I doubt it. We are looking for stuff to do. \u201cWhen they said four to 14, you know that means 12, really,\u201d sighs my world-weary daughter. I had promised her that there would be things she liked and that some people would speak English. As all the jobs have to be explained to the mini-workers; there is a limit to how much she can engage with the Turkish-speaking crowd here. Nonetheless she learns how to make a Domino\u2019s pizza in the Domino\u2019s franchise. When I say learns, I mean she dons the hairnet, is given a lump of pre-prepared dough and sticks some sweetcorn on it. It tastes just like a Domino\u2019s pizza. While she is preparing it I watch some younger kids whizz about delivering Coke. They have chosen to work in the Coca-Cola depot. Dream big, I think. Though I see kids gathered round dummies pretending to be doctors or dentists, every activity seems to consist of an adult instructing kids on how to do their job. Nothing is spontaneous. This is child\u2019s play, adeptly monetised; make-believe only if you believe what you are told. It\u2019s not all terrible. Some kids are enjoying themselves. It\u2019s just completely airless. Sadly nobody is in the mini-nightclub, so I don\u2019t know what professions are on offer there. Bouncer? Pole dancer? The corporate brilliance of KidZania is evident. You find a shopping mall in any big metropolis surrounded by young professional families and basically offer childcare in the name of education. Sessions here are four hours long and ticket prices in London will go from \u00a310 to about \u00a328. They anticipate a big market in school trips.     Barking mad: a young \u2018vet\u2019 examines a dog doll. Photograph: Kiyoshi Ota/Getty Images    A third of their profits are from the brands that pay to participate. That appears to be a lot like advertising to children, but magically they say it isn\u2019t. The brands bang on as though they are philanthropists rather than brands seeking to lock down kids as consumers as soon as they can toddle to the pretend bank. In London, for instance, children will be able to make Innocent smoothies or muesli with Eat Natural. They will learn about car engines with Renault. This makes it all the more real, apparently, and helps kids \u201cunderstand the nature of work\u201d. I am not snotty about theme parks. I am a veteran of Thorpe Park and what my middle daughter called Neurodisney. But here I feel disappointed, rather as I did when I first went to Center Parcs: it wasn\u2019t the future all under a plastic dome \u2013 it was chalets, terrible weather and activities. My imagination outstrips the reality of KidZania, too: it is not a mini-state or anarcho-syndicalist paradise with children running the show but an utterly controlled environment. As childcare goes, KidZania is fine; not as good as reading, but not bad. It is, however, uncreative and strangely un-childcentred \u2013the opposite of how it is sold. The mini-artists are given the gear and an easel on which there is a drawing that they colour in. KidZania was dreamed up by a Mexican entrepreneur, Xavier L\u00f3pez Ancona, who started the first outranch in 1999 attached to Centro Santa Fe shopping centre in Mexico City. Xavier is single and enjoys travelling and \u201chas a deep commitment with Mexico, the society and the children of the world\u201d. Xavier\u2019s insight was that kids left to their own devices play make-believe games, pretending to be grown-ups. \u201cNobody owns role playing,\u201d as he has said. From Kuala Lumpur to Seoul to Lisbon, he has been proved correct. In Tokyo there are long queues and people arrive hours before the doors open. The launch in London has been accompanied by all kinds of promises about interactive learning. The UK chairman, Joel Cadbury (whose family knows a thing or two about child-friendly branding), and his business partner Ollie Vigors are evangelical about this amazing concept. Ollie speaks excitedly about how children can learn how to work in a frozen-food factory, unlocking the exciting secrets of packaging and flash-freezing. Whose children, I wonder. And again I am perturbed that \u201cwork\u201d is being sold as leisure. This entire experience, I am told, is made more \u201cmemorable by the partnerships we have made with businesses\u201d . The essential problem, though, is that this is all being promoted as interactive role play, giving children key skills that are \u201crelevant\u201d to the national curriculum. There is loads of talk about children finding their own \u201cpathways\u201d and \u201cnarratives\u201d. If that narrative involves donning a hairnet to work in a fast-food joint, this is true. But any sense of imagination is absent. Perhaps it is the ultimate introduction to the world of work after all. We watch yet another video containing the management-speak that infants must now be party to: empowerment, vision and resilience. Spare me. Success here means making money in KidZania to spend on the utter rubbish in the KidZania gift shop. The kids are the means of production and thus money is made from children messing about. With no mess. We leave this pretend city of children and go out into the shopping mall. We could be anywhere in the world. The globalised nature of all our desires is met. I want a flat white from Starbucks and to go to Carluccio\u2019s. A wants to look in Gap and Muji. Once it was enough to stick her under a mountain of plastic balls and buy unbiddable flat packs in Ikea. Now we will pay for them to learn to work as we shop. They get to make an Innocent smoothie and pay for the privilege. We all do as we are told. Shop, pay, work, pay, play, pay in a world where everything is branded. Will KidZania be a success? I don\u2019t doubt it will. Will it prepare kids for the future? Sure. A future that my daughter and I could not escape fast enough. Abigail Haworth visits Bangkok\u2019s KidZania     Child\u2019s play: Abigail Haworth at the Bangkok KidZania with her son and his friend.    KidZania opened in Bangkok to much local fanfare a year ago. The digital sky with clouds that curdle before your eyes is unsettling and there\u2019s a sitcom-like jingle playing on a tortuous loop. But my eight-year-old son Sacha and his Thai-Norwegian friend Trym, also eight, love it. Now on their third visit together, they grasp that playing at the jobs here is far removed from adult drudgery. \u201cIt\u2019s called KidZania, Mummy. It\u2019s supposed to be fun,\u201d says Sacha. \u201cAnd there are no bosses telling you off,\u201d adds Trym. How lightly they take the notion of learning real skills from the occupations on offer is clear from the moment they rush inside. They queue to be airline pilots at the flight simulation centre while I join other parents facing short-term redundancy on fake wooden benches. They emerge flushed and giggling 20 minutes later. \u201cWe pulled up the landing wheels when the plane was coming down and made it crash on the runway,\u201d they babble in unison. \u201cIt was brilliant.\u201d It\u2019s taken having one of my own for me to realise that eight-year-old boys are not obnoxious. They just live in their own apocalyptic universe. Still reeling from the discovery, at around the age of six, that their beloved dinosaurs were wiped off the planet by an asteroid, their games involve two things only: saving the world or destroying it. Their imaginations are populated with superheroes, evil geniuses, mutant animals and androids that exterminate anyone who mentions homework. At this age, places like KidZania are mere backdrops. So is growing up in Bangkok away from the tourist bubble. Since Sacha and Trym were born here six weeks apart, they have lived through two military coups and frequent civil strife. During deadly violence in 2010, pro-government snipers commandeered the climbing frames in their favourite park. The following year, waist-high floods paralysed parts of the capital for three months. Sacha, then five, took to wearing his swimming goggles to the supermarket \u201cin case we have to swim home\u201d.     Get well soon: playing at doctors and nurses.    We tend to take our harmless fun where we find it \u2013 even if, like KidZania, it\u2019s on the top floor of the next scourge devouring Bangkok, a giant shopping mall. It\u2019s sweet to see the simple pleasure the boys take in donning blue polyester shirts and becoming postal workers making \u201cimportant deliveries\u201d. After a tussle of gangly limbs over who should carry the clipboard and who should push the trolley (they agree to swap roles halfway through), they set off to deliver packages to different businesses around the venue. For all I know \u2013 I stay back, like an obedient parent \u2013 they could be pretending their cargo contains exploding cockroaches, but it all looks innocent enough. The mini-city has a few jobs with local flavour, including fortune telling (Thailand\u2019s military prime minister is a devotee) and working in a peanut snack factory. Today it\u2019s also scarily successful at mirroring the current state of the nation under junta-led rule. It\u2019s a Sunday, the busiest day, yet the newspaper claiming to be \u201cthe voice of the kidz\u201d, the KidZania Journal, is closed. So is the mock courtroom promising \u201cjustice and fairness\u201d. The Thai staff just smile and shrug when I ask why. Meanwhile the police station and prison are buzzing with action. The peanut snack factory is a surprise hit. Resembling a launderette from outside, it\u2019s all shiny metal drums and workers in white coats. Sacha and Trym learn how to sort good from bad peanuts, coat them with sugared coconut and then seal them in foil bags. The Thai-owned Koh-Kae snack company\u2019s branding is as glaring here as it is everywhere else in KidZania, from the Coke bottling plant to the Honda car dealership. Still, the boys seem more interested in the process than the end product. \u201cI learned something new about peanuts,\u201d says Trym. It\u2019s hard to argue with that. The irony is, in Thailand you have to be rich to do the jobs on offer at KidZania. For a family of four, entry costs 2,660 baht, or close to one week\u2019s salary for the average worker. Sacha and Trym\u2019s previous two visits were birthday treats. I\u2019d probably take them again on special occasions, if only because resistance seems futile. At the end of the afternoon we descend the escalators into the five-floor \u201clifestyle-entertainment complex\u201d below. This one right in the city\u2019s heart is called Paragon.

The future of Gezi Park It was almost two years ago that protesters stood up against bulldozers that were set to destroy Istanbul\u2019s Gezi Park in order to construct on a government-sponsored shopping mall and barracks complex. The ensuing violent police treatment of a growing body of peaceful demonstrators in Taksim Square sparked unrest across Turkey, leading to prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan cancelling the redevelopment project and proposing a referendum.  As David Lepeska reports in Next City, a movement to protect Gezi Park remains strong today. Only two months ago, the original redevelopment plan to destroy the public park reappeared on the city\u2019s strategic agenda, in direct contradiction to official promises of its cancellation. Interestingly, the timing of this move coincided with the decision from Turkey\u2019s environment ministry that shopping malls should be exempt from compulsory environmental impact assessments.  As Lepeska explains, a court ruling on the plan is expected in the coming weeks: if the court approves the plan, a referendum will be held for final approval. And if it is indeed approved, activists have promised to resume street protests. London\u2019s underground Acclaimed London psychogeographer Iain Sinclair has written a new essay in the London Review of Books about underground development in the capital. What began in traditionally wealthy districts such as Chelsea and Mayfair is now spreading all across London: the extension of homes into the very soil of the city, to gain more space.  Following a collaboration with an artistic project in Hackney responding to this excavatory process of gentrification, Sinclair explores the notion of digging underground with both empathy and criticism: \u201cThe epidermis of the city is so heavily policed, so fretted with random chatter, so evidently corrupted by a political assault on locality, that humans unable or unwilling to engage in a war they can\u2019t win respond by venturing into forbidden depths.\u201d Urban wind trees Wind turbines in cities seem unfeasible: they\u2019re large, noisy and potentially dangerous. But designers have now come up with a city-friendly turbine \u2013 and it\u2019s shaped like a tree. As CityMetric reports, French entrepreneur J\u00e9r\u00f4me Michaud-Larivi\u00e8re and his company, New Wind, have created the \u201cArbre \u00e0 Vent\u201d, a 36ft tree-shaped structure covered in leaf-shaped mini-turbines. Each tree produces 3.1kw and could be used to power street lighting; three or four together could run a a nearby building. Ruin porn tourism Uncube magazine explores the impact of abandoned construction projects in Bangkok\u2019s Sathorn Unique Tower. This 49-storey building has sat derelict in the city\u2019s downtown for 17 years, after an economic crisis halted its costly development. (A similar fate befell Torre David in Caracas, which has now been informally occupied.) Leigh Theodore Vlassis calls it \u201cboth a symptom of local boom and bust urban development and an unlikely new symbol for the city as a major \u2018ruin porn\u2019 tourist attraction.\u201d Bizarrely, however, it has influenced the neighbourhood which now develops around it: newer buildings in the area have adopted elements of the tower\u2019s original design. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the presence of the building is valued and gives this area of the city an identity, while its actual fabric remains unvalued, not worthy of the investment to rectify and revive it. This is a perfect example of how urban development is initiated and carried out in Bangkok.\u201d Park(ing) In San Francisco, the Pavement to Parks programme has transformed parking spaces across the city into 51 miniature public parks (or \u201cparklets\u201d) since 2010. More are being designed or built. As the New York Times reports, even in the last two years, at least 72 more parklets have been created in cities around the world \u2013 from Mexico City to Auckland. There is also an annual worldwide event, Park(ing) Day, in which people transform parking spaces into their own miniature parks.  Although the parklets are usually commissioned by nearby small businesses hoping to attract more customers, they still function as public places for people to gather in. Replacing cars with people might sound like an ideal urban strategy \u2013 but some local residents have launched complaints about the loss of parking spaces.

Andrew Drummond announced on his blog yesterday (17 January) that he was returning to Britain because he has \u201ctoo much knowledge\u201d that could prove \u201ctoo dangerous\u2019.  According to his statement, also published by the Bangkok Post, his safety is under threat from \u201cfrom foreign criminals in Thailand working in liaison with the Thai police\u201d. He also said that Thailand\u2019s crime computer crime act is \u201cbeing used by foreign criminals to silence criticism of their activities\u201d. Drummond, who has covered south east Asia for the Observer, the Times and London Evening Standard, wrote:  \u201cI have enjoyed my time in Thailand where I have made many good Thai and foreign friends but there comes a time having too much knowledge which I cannot keep to myself can be too dangerous.  My well being has been threatened as have those of my children. This is not of course the first time, but the recent threat came from a group of people who have killed with impunity before, and have even had police set up people on false charges\u201d.  Drummond is described by the Bangkok Post as an investigative journalist \u201cwho has specialised in exposing the activities of foreign criminals in Thailand\u201d.  In his blog, Drummond wrote of his support for two journalists based in Phuket, Alan Morison and Chutima Sidasathian, who are facing criminal defamation charges brought by the Thai navy for reprinting a Reuters report that alleged complicity in human trafficking by naval officers.  He also spoke up for Andy Hall, the British migrant workers\u2019 advocate, who faces an eight-year jail sentence for defamation after writing a report alleging labour abuses within the Thai pineapple wholesaler, the Natural Fruit Company. Drummond wrote: \u201cThe harassment of Andy, Alan and Chutima has no place in a country calling itself free.

I saw damaged dunes and other soft, natural infrastructure that had been washed away, leaving neighbourhoods completely unprotected ... I saw homes destroyed, neighbourhoods disrupted, people\u2019s lives destroyed.\u201d Rodin, who became president of US philanthropic organisation the Rockefeller Foundation in 2005, had already made building the resilience of cities and communities one of the foundation\u2019s key objectives. But Sandy confirmed to her that \u201cit was the most important work we could do\u201d. Hence, the emphasis on the foundation\u2019s 100 Resilient Cities programme, and now this book. \u201cIn a time as turbulent as ours,\u201d she writes, \u201cwe have no choice: we must all work to build greater resilience.\u201d The Rockefeller Foundation partners the Guardian Cities website, and to mark both the publication of her book in the UK and the site\u2019s first anniversary, Rodin recently paid a visit to the Guardian\u2019s London office. Time was short but she talks fast and shoots from the hip, and we covered a lot of storm-ravaged ground. Rodin defines resilience as \u201cthe capacity to bounce back from a crisis, learn from it, and achieve revitalisation\u201d. Her gameplan for building resilience is threefold \u2013 being prepared, responding to the immediate crisis, and then, perhaps most important of all, developing something better in its place. \u201cNever let a good crisis go to waste,\u201d she says, quoting Churchill. \u201cCrisis is becoming the new normal,\u201d she warns. \u201cGlobally, in 2011, we spent $320bn just on recovery from natural disasters. That\u2019s not sustainable given all the other types of disasters we have to confront.\u201d But hasn\u2019t the world always been faced with one crisis or another? \u201cThey are becoming far more expensive \u2013 the data show that.\u201d     The aftermath of Superstorm Sandy: \u2018New York viewed itself as quite resilient ... yet Sandy was catastrophic\u2019. Photograph: Julio Cortez/AP    Trained as a psychologist, with a first degree from the University of Pennsylvania in the mid-1960s and then a PhD from Columbia, she is very keen on data rather than guesswork. \u201cThere have always been challenges and crises, but they tended to be big events and then they ended. Now it\u2019s much less episodic. Disasters are much more frequent, and because we\u2019re so globally interconnected, their impact affects everything in the world. The Bangkok flooding [in 2011] took down a third of the global supply chain.\u201d At the root of much of this is climate change. \u201cIt has dramatically upped the stakes in terms of the number of crises,\u201d Rodin says. \u201cThen there\u2019s rapid urbanisation: it\u2019s estimated that at the rate at which urbanisation is occurring, particularly in the developing world, 40% of the infrastructure that will exist in 35 years is not yet built. We can get that right, or we can get it horribly wrong.\u201d  Rodin cites the example of Brazil, which is rapidly growing and urbanising: \u201cYou can simply build a city grid, or you can build one with smart-grid technology that allows you to sample from whatever source of energy is most available, thus reducing your dependence on fossil fuels \u2013 and with a smart switch that allows you to delink from a piece [of infrastructure] that\u2019s failing, so you don\u2019t get half a city being taken down.\u201d The eventual 100 \u201cresilient cities\u201d selected for Rockefeller\u2019s programme (to date, 67 have been announced) will be the most visible part of the initiative. But really, Rodin wants to change mindsets everywhere, and usher in \u201ca new way of thinking about how we invest our resources, whether it\u2019s a building or a city or a business\u201d.  Superstorm Sandy sharpened her approach because it made her realise how complacent cities could be. \u201cNew York has viewed itself as quite resilient, and there was a great deal of real and significant attention and investment after 9/11 to becoming more resilient \u2013 and yet Sandy was catastrophic.\u201d Unless resilience is built into the culture of cities, Rodin says, there is always the prospect of disruption turning into disaster. Disruptions, in her way of thinking, are inevitable; disasters aren\u2019t. Indeed, with an integrated approach to resilience, disruption can be turned to advantage. Every crisis is an opportunity. The Chinese were there way before Churchill. Rodin traces her interest in the idea of resilience back to her days as a psychology student. \u201cSome of my early work was in the question of why, when you have children who grow up in equally disadvantaged neighbourhoods, a few of them succeed while most of them catastrophically fail. When I came to the University of Pennsylvania [she was the first female president of an Ivy League university] we were situated in the midst of what had become a horrifically disadvantaged neighbourhood, and I realised that some of the capacity building and the thinking about resilience that I had done around individuals could also be applied to the community level.\u201d     Rodin pictured in 2013 with then New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and World Bank Group president Jim Yong Kim. Photograph: Ramin Talaie/Getty Images    Rodin worked to revitalise not just the university but the community in which it was situated, and wrote a book called The University and Urban Revival to demonstrate how elite institutions could galvanise wider society. \u201cThe important part of the book is summed up in the subtitle \u2013 Out of the Ivory Tower and Into the Streets,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about the obligation of these elite institutions in terms of what they can and should be doing with their neighbourhoods.\u201d This was all by way of preparation for her current work: \u201cI came to Rockefeller in 2005. Then Katrina hit and 7/7 hit. We intervened heavily in Katrina, and I realised this was a much bigger issue and a much bigger domain, and that we could do something transformational if we invested heavily, worked in a really creative way, took some risks.\u201d This was when Rodin placed what one observer called her \u201cbig bet\u201d \u2013 adjusting the focus of a philanthropic organisation that had established its reputation in global public health programmes to this new-fangled idea of resilience. \u201cI hope it is paying off,\u201d she says, though she clearly isn\u2019t in much doubt that it is. \u201cMost of all it\u2019s paying off in lives around the world, which we have shown are really helped by those investments.\u201d But what does \u201cresilience\u201d actually mean? It covers so many different types of crisis \u2013 climate change, natural disasters, cyber-attacks, even the financial crash of 2007/8, which, she says, was the result of having a \u201cvery brittle and non-resilient economic system globally, so one piece took everything down\u201d. Is the term so broad as to be almost useless? \u201cThat\u2019s something my board ask me all the time,\u201d she admits. \u201cThey say, \u2018Convince us that you\u2019re not just trying to be all things to all people.\u2019 But I think it is quite specific, and that\u2019s why in the book I talk first about the five characteristics of resilience, because those anchor it.\u201d Those characteristics are awareness, diversity, integration, the capacity for self-regulation, and adaptiveness; a community needs all five to be resilient, Rodin says. While the number of threats against which she is trying to build resilience looks ludicrously numerous and varied, she believes the specificity of the rules laid down makes the programme manageable.     Floating houses near Amsterdam, built to combat sea-level rise; the Netherlands is painted in heroic terms in Rodin\u2019s book. Photograph: Ashley Cooper/Alamy    Most strikingly, Rodin rejects the idea of \u201cstability\u201d as an overriding ambition. \u201cI differentiate resilience from stability, because stability is the tendency \u2013 both in engineering terms and psychological terms \u2013 to try to get back to normal, to rebalance. This [book] is really saying, \u2018what made you vulnerable in the first place was that equilibrium\u2019, so you\u2019ve got to use this hit, if it does happen, to adapt and grow and revitalise. New Orleans has done that.\u201d Her idea of resilience is a dynamic condition: one is not so much resilient as forever working towards resilience, and the benefits of that striving are the \u201cdividend\u201d she believes will accrue regardless of whether the disaster actually hits. The Netherlands is painted in heroic terms in the book: in the face of the threat from the sea, the Dutch have created a resilient, integrated, socially inclusive society that can withstand not just potential inundation but lots of other things besides. And that\u2019s the dividend: a society that doesn\u2019t function properly can\u2019t be resilient; a society that isn\u2019t resilient doesn\u2019t function properly. Rodin and the foundation are also committed to encouraging fairer, more equitable societies \u2013 but she admits that is proving a tougher nut to crack. \u201cOut of our original strategic planning, our two pillars initially were building greater resilience and achieving more equitable growth; we saw them going together. But that was pre-2008. We were working on more equitable growth, but then the bottom fell out of the economy and there wasn\u2019t much growth. We had to reframe what this new period was going to be all about, and we have come to more shared prosperity, more inclusive economies.\u201d  On the day we met, Oxfam had just published a report showing that 1% of the world\u2019s population held half of all global wealth. Creating more equitable societies is going to be some task. \u201cClearly, there are forces that oppose this kind of narrative about the worry for the poor and vulnerable, but that\u2019s true in all of the things we do. We have always tried to focus attention on the people who often get forgotten by the policy-makers. We don\u2019t expect to be the people who solve these problems, but we use them as the lens to form the initiatives we launch on the ground.\u201d The Ebola outbreak in west Africa came too late for the book. She says it demonstrates a lack of resilience both in the region affected and among international health bodies, and also criticises the \u201cover-responsiveness\u201d of the authorities in the US, which reacted with near-panic and threatened to stop people from west Africa entering the country.     According to Rodin, Norway showed impressive resilience in the wake of the mass killings on Utoya island in 2011. Photograph: Lefteris Pitarakis/AP    While Rodin says it\u2019s too early to judge whether the French response to the attacks on Paris can be termed \u201cresilient\u201d, she draws a parallel with the Breivik killings in Norway in 2011, which are dealt with in great detail in her book. She admires the way the country responded to that horrific and unprecedented event: \u201cThe resilience narrative around that is that they didn\u2019t let the anti-Muslim and anti-immigration fervour of the killer divide them as a society.\u201d Despite the slaughter, Norway didn\u2019t become any less Norwegian. I suggest that, as philanthropists go, she is a pretty tough one, willing to cut off NGOs the foundation is funding if they are no longer deemed to be performing. \u201cThey have to be producing,\u201d Rodin says. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the business of only keeping civil society going. If they\u2019re not producing some impact, they may have gone past their time of productivity.\u201d She also says it\u2019s important that philanthropic organisations work with commercial firms and try to get them to adapt their behaviour. Capitalism will not be overturned but perhaps made more equitable \u2013 and more efficient too.  The US is a country with numerous multimillionaires and a great reputation for philanthropy, yet remains in many ways a dysfunctional society. Is philanthropy papering over the cracks and making up for political failures? \u201cPhilanthropy is not charity,\u201d she insists. \u201cCharity assists until we can get it right. The role of philanthropy is to change the model so that [the underlying problem] doesn\u2019t occur.\u201d She argues that because philanthropic organisations get tax breaks, their money should be considered as risk capital and be used to innovate and challenge. Hence her big bet on resilience. Rodin clocks up 10 years at the Rockefeller Foundation this year. Most past presidents have done a decade, so is she eyeing the exit? \u201cI\u2019m loving what I\u2019m doing,\u201d she says. Then she returns to the gambling theme: \u201cWhen you take on real change in the organisation you lead, you get a stack of chips and you start using them up \u2013 and when they\u2019re gone you gotta go.

The company\u2019s top 100 city destination rankings, released on Tuesday, ranked Hong Kong, Singapore and Bangkok in its top three spots, followed by London and Paris. Beijing ranked 34th, in between Johannesburg and Sofia, Bulgaria.   Related: Air pollution in China \u2013 in pictures    Wang, a former official in the state-controlled petroleum sector and in north-west China\u2019s Gansu province, said the pollution was caused by its distribution of polluting factories and skyrocketing ownership of motor vehicles. In his speech, he demanded that Beijing\u2019s polluting factories shut down entirely rather than \u201cirresponsibly relocate\u201d to neighbouring areas of Hebei and Tianjin. In 2014, Beijing authorities closed 392 companies for causing pollution and took 476,000 old vehicles off the roads, Wang said. He added that despite the choking pollution, Beijing\u2019s biggest problem was population control, claiming the influx of migrant labour put strains on the city\u2019s infrastructure. The city has 21.5 million residents and is growing at a rate of more than 350,000 a year. In September 2013, China\u2019s cabinet introduced a sweeping anti-pollution plan, which included prohibiting the construction of new coal-fired power plants in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, the country\u2019s three most important cities. \u201cThis represents the government is strict with science, truth-seeking, responsible for the people and determined to pursue human-centred administration, improve the environment and safeguard people\u2019s health rights,\u201d said the announcement.

But he missed a trick by not saying it because it would have been an excellent and appropriate catchphrase. For years, Sampras reigned supreme on Centre Court. It was his patch. There were challengers but, Richard Krajicek\u2019s toppling of Sampras in their quarter-final in 1996 aside, they tended to walk on court more in trepidation than expectation. Other than that one blip, Sampras ruled SW19, lifting the men\u2019s singles title there on seven occasions between 1993 and 2000. Yet an ageing Sampras was slowing down at turn of the millennium, finally showing signs of vulnerability on the grass when he almost lost to the British wild card, Barry Cowan, in the second round in 2001. Sampras won in five sets and then breezed past Sargis Sargsian in straight sets in the third round, but this was new. The old champion was looking, well, old and Roger Federer was waiting for him in the fourth round. Who? The 15th seed did not inspire dread in his opponents yet. It was only Federer\u2019s third appearance at Wimbledon, he had made quiet exits in the first round in the previous two years and the tennis aficionados on Centre Court were not overly familiar with this pony-tailed pretender in front of them. But they soon would be. People do not always appreciate genius when they first see it. We all know someone who has been badgered into watching The Wire, showing remarkable self-restraint not to snap at you for beaming expectantly at them the whole way through the first episode and then turned to you when it is over and asked what all the fuss was about. Boring. Too many characters, too many things going on, couldn\u2019t understand the accents. Not watching that again. Thanks for wasting an hour of my life. They soon understand the hype after watching a few more episodes. Then they\u2019re hooked and spared from the ire of the writer of The Wire, David Simon, who has been less than complimentary about the casual viewer in the past. Yet it is curious that it can be such a challenge for people to embrace one of the finest television programmes ever. It is just that the genius was not immediately obvious or accessible. Which brings us back to Federer, who in that sense is the anti-Wire. Not that he lacks intelligence or depth or mystery or layers or even contradictions to his character, rather that even someone with a passing interest in tennis only needs to watch Federer for a few minutes to realise that a genius is work. Even though he is no longer quite as special as he was at his peak, seeing him in the flesh at least once is on everyone\u2019s tennis bucket list. Even if you don\u2019t like tennis. A bit like visiting Buckingham Palace. You just want to say that you\u2019ve been. Yet he did not have that aura when he found himself on the opposite side of the net to Sampras. Federer was a relative nobody in 2001. No one knew who Mirka was. There were no RF caps. He wasn\u2019t Roger Federer yet, he was just another player who was supposed to be put in his place by Sampras. And then Federer started playing tennis and what a thrill it was. He won the first set on a tie-break, but Sampras, ever the great champion, fought back to take the second set 7-5. Back came Federer in the third: he won it 6-4. Back came Federer in the fourth: it went his way on a tie-break and they were into a fifth. Neither man gave an inch, the level was absurdly high and then Federer held serve to lead 6-5, heaping the pressure on Sampras. Fifteen-all became 15-30 \u2013 and then Sampras netted a volley to hand Federer two match points. Federer only needed one. Sampras tries to serve and volley on a court that was no longer as conducive to that tactic any more \u2013 the old versus the new, tennis for the 20th century finding itself badly exposed against the man who would come to redefine the sport \u2013 and Federer instantly picked him off with a gorgeous forehand down the line. Federer came at the king. He did not miss, and then he lost to Tim Henman in the next round. 2) Bewildering Roddick Of all the activities Federer enjoys most, tormenting Andy Roddick ranked high on his list of favourites. They met 24 times between 2001 and 2012 and while Roddick won three of their encounters, the majority of his matches against Federer were gut-wrenching experiences. Roddick played seven finals against Federer and he lost seven finals to Federer, the most chastening of which was undoubtedly his five-set defeat in that Wimbledon epic in 2009, when he finally succumbed 16-14 in the final set. He led twice. In the second-set tie-break, he spurned four set points for a two-set lead and it would be understandable if those four little points flash through Roddick\u2019s head every time he goes to sleep at night. He\u2019s only human, after all. Still, at least he was there to witness history being made, while blinking through the tears; it was Federer\u2019s sixth Wimbledon title. Federer mostly met and beat Roddick in big matches. The Wimbledon finals in 2004 and 2005. A US Open final in 2006. Australian Open semi-finals in 2007 (6-4, 6-0, 6-2) and 2009. Finals in Toronto, Bangkok and Cincinnati. Forget the finals, though. Federer\u2019s finest moment against Roddick came in a quarter-final in Basel in 2002. Before he was great. After all, 2002 was largely a forgettable year for Federer. He lost to Tommy Haas in the fourth round of the Australian Open; Hicham Arazi in the first round of the French Open; Mario Ancic (remember him?) in the first round at Wimbledon and Max Mirnyi in the fourth round of the US Open. Greatness remained tantalisingly out of reach. Yet it was impossible to keep a lid on that brilliance for ever. It was bubbling away, little drops seeping out here and there and giving us a taste of tennis that would leave crowds cooing and gasping and utterly, hopelessly, breathlessly awestruck. Federer crowds don\u2019t cheer, they make the kind of sound a Crane brother would make upon tasting a particularly fine wine, the kind of sound that should not really be heard until well after the watershed. Can you blame them? Watching Federer should come with a health warning that you might need someone to winch your jaw off the floor or to pop your eyes back in their sockets when the match is over. It is rumoured that people are so wide-eyed when they watch Federer at his best that they forget how to blink. Imagine being the poor sod on the other side of the net. Roddick was serving at 1-3 in the second set in Basel. He serve-volleyed on the first point and the way he played it would have been enough to overcome most opponents. Two firm volleys forced Federer into a defensive lob on the backhand side and the ball sat up invitingly for Roddick to put away a smash. He hammered it into the ground and back up again, high towards the right corner \u2013 and then Federer set off in pursuit of the ball. Almost running backwards, he was a few yards behind the baseline when he reached the ball and then, with a slight leap, he strained every sinew in his body and spun an outrageous smash from an impossible angle past a bewildered Roddick and down the line for an astonishing winner. It had to be inch-perfect. Roddick was waiting at the net as Federer jabbed his racquet sharply at the ball, as though he was throwing a fishing line into the water, and then the American was looking as annoyed as Stifler after being told that the cops were on their way to cancel his party. Roddick\u2019s mock annoyance as he threw his racquet at Federer said it all. If there is one consolation for Roddick, it is that he won their last meeting before he retired, beating Federer 7-6, 1-6, 6-4 in Miami in 2012. You take what you can get.            3) The tweener Type \u201cgreat players\u201d into YouTube\u2019s search bar and the first suggestion is \u201cgreat players humiliate each other on the pitch\u201d. Ronaldinho nutmegging Steven Gerrard, Cristiano Ronaldo scooping the ball past Lionel Messi, the entire Brazil team taking it in turns to be embarrassed by Zinedine Zidane at the 2006 World Cup. Yet you will not find many clips of tennis\u2019s big four producing trick shots against each other, which partly explains why Federer\u2019s tweener against Novak Djokovic in their US Open semi-final in 2009 was greeted with such amazement. It made sense when he did it against Marinko Matosevic at the US Open last year and against Brian Dabul in 2010, but against Djokovic? And at such a crucial point in the match? Djokovic trailed by two sets and was serving at 0-30 at 5-5 in the third set when Federer sent the ball fizzing past him to set up a decisive break. Even Federer, usually so unflappable during matches, allowed himself a smile and pumped his fist. 4) Victory at last at Roland Garros It was a teary start to 2009 for Federer. He reached the final of the Australian Open, but his nemesis was lying in wait. Rafael Nadal had removed his Wimbledon crowd six months earlier and now he was after his first title in Melbourne. Four hours and 23 minutes later, Nadal had won 7\u20135, 3\u20136, 7\u20136, 3\u20136, 6\u20132 and Federer\u2019s eyes were starting to well up. Nadal was in his head and not only had he conquered him on concrete and grass, his unrivalled dominance on clay was also stopping Federer from completing his career grand slam. Federer faced Nadal in the French Open semi-finals in 2005 and the final in 2006 and 2007 and he lost each time. They were seeded to meet in the final in 2009, but Nadal\u2019s knees had other ideas and so did Robin Soderling, the Swede winning their fourth-round match 6-2, 6-7, 6-4, 7-6 and leaving the path clear for Federer. Yet there was no guarantee that Federer would capitalise on Nadal\u2019s exit, not least when he trailed Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro after three sets of their semi-final. Surely the chance was not going to pass Federer by. Of course not. On a grey, rainy Paris afternoon, Federer steeled himself and won the fourth set 6-1, before edging a deciding set in which this spectacular squash shot was the highlight. His opponent in the final was Soderling. Federer\u2019s gratitude only went so far, winning 6-1, 7-6, 6-4 to claim his one and only French Open title. 5) Ending Djokovic\u2019s unbeaten run Those who say that Nadal is a superior player to Federer justifiably point to his 23-10 winning record. Yet theirs is a strange rivalry, one that only truly hit the heights during that period when they faced each other in seven grand slam finals between 2006 and 2009, gradually becoming more sedate as time moved on. The Wimbledon final in 2008, arguably the best match of all time, was the 18th meeting between Federer and Nadal. Yet since then they have only played each other 15 times and Nadal has won 11 times. When they met in the semi-finals of the Australian Open last year, Nadal winning comfortably in three forgettable sets, it was their first encounter at a grand slam since the Australian Open in 2012 (Nadal won that match in four sets). Does the reality match the hype? Is it not the case that Federer\u2019s rivalry with Djokovic is more interesting? It is much closer and they have played each other more often. Federer leads their head-to-head record 19-17 and their 37th match was set to be in the final of the ATP World Tour Finals in November, until Federer pulled out with a late injury. It was never a problem for Nadal to beat Federer, even when he was a teenager, and he won six of their first seven matches. Djokovic needed longer to work Federer out, losing five of their first six meetings before his coming-of-age victory in their Australian Open semi-final in 2008. The balance of power has swung back and forth since then. The Federer tweener in 2009 and his surprise win under the Wimbledon roof in 2012 stand out, as do that Djokovic forehand when he was facing match point in the US Open semi-final in 2011 and his win in last year\u2019s Wimbledon final. Their French Open semi-final in 2011 was another memorable occasion. Djokovic was fresh from crushing Andy Murray in the Australian Open final and he was unbeaten in 43 matches, yet Federer was inspired, winning 7-6, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6. 6) The volley that flummoxed Murray The construction of the point was beautiful. Having survived a strong, focused assault from Andy Murray in the Wimbledon final in 2012, Roger Federer had steaded himself in the second set and, leading 6-5 and 30-40 on the Scot\u2019s serve, he was a point away from levelling the match. He had been 30-0 down and, in the words of the BBC commentator, he had conjured up the set point out of nothing. The tension inside Centre Court was unbearable as Murray prepared to serve and what followed was magnificent from both men. Yet Federer was too good. The rally lasted 27 seconds. Murray delivered a hard first serve down the middle and Federer responded with an instinctive forehand to Murray\u2019s backhand. Murray produced a defensive slice and Federer targeted his backhand again with an inside-out forehand. Murray\u2019s backhand was almost strong enough to knock Federer off-balance but he adjusted in time to knock a forehand back and now it seemed that Murray was in control as he tore into a couple of forehands. Federer steadied himself, however, brought the rally back to neutral and then went on the attack with a rasping forehand to Murray\u2019s right, followed by that one-handed backhand into the opposite corner. Murray was on the ropes and yet the quality of his defensive slice might have saved him against someone else. The ball landed near Federer\u2019s feet, so he moved his racquet downwards and cushioned a delightful drop-volley over the net, putting just enough on it to give Murray hope of reaching it until that one last crucial bit of spin revealed itself. One second Murray had it, the next everyone was reacting like they had seen a ninja disappear in a ball of smoke. Where did it go? How did he do that? Was that Roger Federer being Roger Federer? It was. The match was level and Federer\u2019s seventh Wimbledon title was on the way.

The newly elected sheriff, Stephen Haskell, now requires the deputies of Sublette County to wear a black baseball cap and boots, along with black pants and a tan shirt, rather than the eclectic array of western gear they were previously permitted to wear. The new rule has rankled some, including veteran deputy Gene Bryson, who retired after decades on the force last week. Bryson bluntly told the local Caspar Star-Tribune: \u201cI am not going to change.\u201d Haskell instituted the new policy because rubber-soled boots have better traction over the snow and ice that envelops Wyoming\u2019s mountains and plains every winter.

He said the way people speak and live in the west \u201cdon\u2019t make it a better place\u201d but are the qualities that make it home. Haskell is no easterner; he grew up in Wyoming and worked as a semiprofessional rodeo rider for several years. And the rebel deputy Bryson, who is 70, admitted he had planned to retire this year anyway. Pinedale\u2019s mayor and others have supported Haskell\u2019s changes, which dictate nothing about the large and colorful boots, belt buckles and headwear that many Wyomingites love to adorn themselves with in their free time, and which men and women like Bell cherish as emblems of the west.

Farce, when the government had to hurriedly delete a scene showing a schoolboy painting a picture of Hitler in a film promoting prime minister Prayuth Chan-ocha\u2019s \u201c12 core values\u201d, a list of duties and responsibilities vaguely reminiscent of Vichy France\u2019s \u201ctravail, famille, patrie\u201d.  Incompetence, sabotage, or what: who knows? It was farcical, too, when a prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, who had already been forced out, was solemnly impeached by an assembly that did not have the power to impeach. Even if it had, nobody could explain how impeachment, a method of removing a leader from office, could apply to one who had already departed. But such constitutional illiteracy is an everyday phenomenon in the generals\u2019 Thailand. Farce, again, but darker, when critics are \u201cinvited\u201d to army installations for \u201cattitude adjustment\u201d sessions. Farce, shading into persecution, when opponents are tried in military courts with no right of appeal or forced to sign documents that allow the seizure of their assets if they engage in political activity, or pursued on corruption charges when similar allegations against the junta\u2019s supporters are neglected. The latest twist came on Thursday when the attorney general filed charges against Yingluck, the sister of Thaksin Shinawatra, who turned Thai politics upside down a decade and a half ago. Thaksin, now in exile, tapped into the needs, aspirations and frustrations of the less well-off majority, particularly in the countryside, and did it in a way that has enabled him or his proxies to win every election in Thailand since. The Thai elite was both enraged and perplexed, and remains so. It felt his majority was somehow unfair, that he had bought his support, and indeed Thaksin was and is a populist bearing some resemblance to a figure like Silvio Berlusconi. Still, he had the votes. Subterfuge, legal legerdemain and, finally, military intervention have all failed to alter the situation: the Thaksin phenomenon won\u2019t go away, and wouldn\u2019t even if he himself were to pass from the scene. As the Thai military and its civilian allies labour in vain to create a political system that looks respectable but in which the pro-Thaksin forces cannot win, there are signs that elements within the regime understand that some form of accommodation might be more realistic and more successful. Shadowy envoys flit back and forth between Bangkok and Dubai, where Thaksin lives. The charges against Yingluck may be part of a process involving both bargaining and threats. The tragedy, as this drifts on, is that Thailand is wasting time it can ill afford. Its economy is faltering just when it most needs growth. Its society is unsettled as the difficult moment when the country has to cope with the succession to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 87 and not well, comes closer.

To further complicate the legal aftermath, Veronika\u2019s offspring \u2013 Valkyrie-like gallerist Gro (best name from Norse mythology ever); repressed lawyer Frederik; freewheeling wastrel Emil; and secret illegitimate daughter Signe \u2013 were sired by three different fathers: a first husband who shot himself in the barn, a divorced second who still lives in a caravan on the estate and a chap who came to fix the roof. Set and filmed on the visually desaturated island of Funen \u2013 which is linked to the more cosmopolitan landmass Zealand by the Great Belt suspension bridge, a comforting visual talisman for Scandiphiles \u2013 The Legacy has an evocative, interwoven, smalltown feel; life outside of the rarefied art-installation set revolves around the fortunes of the local handball (h\u00e5ndbold) team, lending the story a modest, indoor, Friday Night Lights vibe.     Frederik (played by Carsten Bj\u00f8rnlund), looking every bit the suspicious sibling.    The series opens at an ear-splitting handball play-off, with catalyst Signe concealed inside the giant-headed costume of the team mascot for maximum symbolism: she\u2019s literally in the dark about the \u201cdeathbed will\u201d that will arrive later that day from the dying mother she didn\u2019t know she had. Signe is cautiously welcomed into her new, wealthy, rather shrill family \u2013 her father, the handball team\u2019s avuncular coach, was the handyman who enjoyed free love with Veronika two decades earlier \u2013 but an executorial storm is brewing. Frederik (Carsten Bj\u00f8rnlund, a dead cert for future casting as an SS officer) wants the house for his young family; Gro (Trine Dyrholm, star of every notable Danish film since Festen) wants to convert it into a living art museum; and hipster Emil (a tousle-fringed, ruddy-cheeked Mikkel Boe F\u00f8lsgaard) owes money to the Bangkok mafia (one knowingly anglicised subtitle refers to him as \u201cthat little turd\u201d). Humble florist Signe, meanwhile, wants only to be part of the family \u2013 until, that is, they try to fob her off, and her hirsute handball-heartthrob boyfriend calls in m\u2019learned friends. The Legacy (indigenous title Arvingerne), shown here on Sky Arts, has been described, with the usual sneer, as \u201csoapy\u201d \u2013 and it certainly pulled an EastEnders-like crowd when it aired on DR1 last year, reaching a peak of just under 2 million viewers (out of a population of 5.6 million). Already into its second series in Denmark and set for an inferior US remake, it evidently has long narrative legs. As creator and chief writer Maya Ils\u00f8e says: \u201cYou don\u2019t know your family until you inherit with them.\u201d A refreshing change from gloomy, rain-lashed Copenhagen-based policework, The Legacy gives a valuable glimpse into open-plan, middle-class life.

Alex joined trip4real a few months ago to promote the secret supper club he runs here and, from last month, on a 1914 Dutch barge moored in Barking.

In the olden days you could tell a friend, \u201cYou just have to see House of Games; it\u2019s the best scam movie of the year!\u201d or \u201cI will not stop badgering you until you see Nine Queens! It\u2019s the best South American scam movie of the year!\u201d And back in the olden days people would reply: \u201cYeah, sure, I\u2019ll get to it when I get to it.\u201d But then the film would end its theatrical run, so your friends had a legitimate excuse to ignore you. They would assure you that they would get around to seeing that Argentine movie about the bank robber with epilepsy or the French movie about the woman who mistakes a tax attorney for a shrink as soon as it came out on DVD. Or VHS. And that would be the end of it. But this pop cultural duty-shirking is no longer possible. Films never go away any more. As soon as a film leaves the cinema it becomes available online somewhere. So it is no longer possible to say: \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t get around to seeing that strange Austrian cowboy movie that you wouldn\u2019t shut up about for the past three weeks. But now it\u2019s gone.\u201d They can no longer say this because the strange Austrian cowboy movie is never gone. No movie is ever gone. They are all out there somewhere. I belong to a small network of kindred spirits who ceaselessly feed each other unsolicited film recommendations. But it\u2019s never The Imitation Game or American Sniper, because these films have long runs in cinemas and you simply assume that your friends have seen them. No, the things I recommend are almost always films such as The Dark Valley, an exquisitely dark Alpine cowboy movie starring Sam Riley as a vengeful Austrian gunslinger, or Stretch, by far the funniest American movie of the past year, or The Hidden Face, a creepy Colombian movie about a woman trapped inside the secret compartment of a sprawling mansion who is forced to observe the sexual activities of the woman who replaces her in her boyfriend\u2019s arms, but can do nothing about it.   Related: Joe Carnahan's Stretch review: limo drivers are as miserable as the rest of us    Typical recommendations are offbeat Korean gangster movies (The Man from Nowhere) or offbeat French films (Man on The Train) or offbeat Finnish films (The Man Without a Past). The films often have the words \u201cthe man\u201d in the title. Either that, or \u201cbalalaika\u201d. Once I see these movies, I want to share them with my friends. I cannot help myself. But if I share my recommendations with my friends and they ignore me, I get very cross. Very, very cross. Very cross indeed. The films are not always obscure. They do not always have names like Kinoman or Parlez-Moi de La Pluie or Myn Bala: Warriors of the Steppe. They are not always films about good-natured Danish cannibals. A case in point: for the past few weeks I have been mercilessly harassing friends with an avalanche of texts, insisting that they watch the highly publicised but little viewed comedy The Interview, which Netflix has been streaming. They say that they will watch it, but then they don\u2019t. They say that they have to take the dog to the vet (my son) or that they just fractured their wrist (my sister) or that they fell down and broke their ankle while visiting Maui (my friend in rural Florida). And then I text them again. And again. And again. I say things such as: \u201cIf you broke your ankle falling down the steps while visiting Maui, how can you possibly say that you don\u2019t have time to watch this movie? You\u2019re not going anywhere, sister. So suck it up, stop procrastinating and watch the goddamn film.\u201d In response, they fire back things such as \u201cWait a sec; you\u2019re the guy who said that you hate James Franco and all his works.\u201d And I text back: \u201cI do. In general. But not in this. He\u2019s really funny. So you have to watch it. I will not rest until you do.\u201d   Related: The Interview review \u2013 Rogen and Franco soon run out of laughs    Eventually they cave in to the pressure. Because they realise that there is nowhere to hide. They can hide from my phone calls and emails, but they can\u2019t hide from my texts, because no one can hide from other people\u2019s texts. And then, after they finally see The Interview, they text back: \u201cWow, that was really, really funny. Especially the stuff about Katy Perry. But you can understand why I was hesitant to follow your advice. You\u2019re the guy who once recommended the film where Seth Rogen plays a mall cop. Or have you perhaps forgotten?\u201d The problem with having all this stuff available all the time is that it ultimately leads to a particularly modern form of insanity. My friend in Florida sends me texts in the middle of the night pressuring me to see Sam Rockwell films such as Better Living Through Chemistry. She also does this with films where Ethan Hawke plays a well-meaning haematologist vampire who doesn\u2019t get along with all the other vampires. If I do not watch the film within 24 hours, she will start to badger me. She will call and demand: \u201cHave you seen that Australian Ethan Hawke vampire movie that I recommended? Why not? It\u2019s been a week.\u201d I usually come back at her, both guns blazing, banging the drum for John Cusack thrillers that just barely saw the light of day. Or films where Kristin Scott Thomas plays a murderous mob momma on a trip to Bangkok to see Ryan Gosling. Or movies where Ray Winstone plays a rogue cop that all the young female rogue cops desperately want to sleep with. For reasons that are not clear. Usually, my friend gets the message and backs off.   Related: Only God Forgives \u2013 review    It used to be that people only felt social pressure to see films that were successful and/or good. The Matrix. Gladiator. Rocky. Gone With the Wind. If films bombed or sucked or never got released theatrically, people had an excuse not to see them. But the internet has created a shadow world where good taste and box office receipts and critics\u2019 opinions no longer apply. The internet allows us to rearrange the world the way we want it, so that Sam Rockwell occupies the spot held by George Clooney in the real world, everybody loves Austrian cowboy movies and Val Kilmer never stopped being a big star. The net is loaded with films that never - or only barely \u2013 made it into cinemas, but that are not actually horrible. No, they are not great. They are definitely not great. But they are at least as good as the latest Shailene Woodley film. Headshot. Age of Uprising. The Horde. Cuban Fury. A Long Way Down. The Numbers Station. The Winning Season. That said, the fact that they are not actually horrible does not provide anyone with the moral justification for badgering other people into seeing them. Just because a film is not horrible doesn\u2019t mean that it has to be watched. It\u2019s not a crime to refuse to watch films about likable Danish cannibals. At least not so far.

Photograph: ARC Entertainment/Allstar/ARC ENTERTAINMENT    A lot of us belong to a secret online society dominated by films that ordinary people don\u2019t care about. We\u2019re like kids who trade bootlegs of bands no one else has ever heard of while everyone else is listening to Coldplay. Yet we know when to tone it down. I would not dream of pressuring my wife or my three sisters into watching a western where January Jones plays a pistol-packin\u2019 whore hell-bent on revenge (Sweetwater). I just wouldn\u2019t. But I do it with my film buff friends. And I insist that they watch the latest Agn\u00e8s Jaoui film, because all of her films are brilliant. Nor will I rest until they report that they have watched Kitchen Tales, The Aura, Flame &amp; Citron, The Cuckoo, Election (the one directed by Johnnie To), Eight Women, Valhalla Rising, A Pain in the Ass, The Double Hour, The Boss of It All, Barbara, Goodbye, Lenin, Adam\u2019s Apples, Two Lives, The Green Butchers, Au Bout Portant, Tell No One, Frozen Land, Shadows in Paradise, Le Havre, Ashes and Diamonds and, of course, Leningrad Cowboys: Total Balalaika Show. Is this a form of harassment? Yes, I suppose it is. But my friends are just as bad as I am. If I recommend a weird Thai movie to my friend in Amherst, Massachusetts, he comes right back with a weird Dutch movie. And, in my defence, I honestly think that we\u2019re all performing a vital public service in spreading the word about films that might otherwise go unnoticed or at least under-appreciated. That last John Cusack thriller (The Numbers Station) was pretty good. Stretch was hilarious. And January Jones was really convincing as a murderous prostitute riding the high country in Sweetwater.

Bennett, leader of the Greens since 2012, was launching the party\u2019s election campaign and had scheduled a full day of media interviews. But by 10am the wheels had spectacularly fallen off the Greens\u2019 campaign.    Related: Caroline Lucas: 'I\u2019m not in politics because I\u2019m playing about'    In an interview with Nick Ferrari on LBC radio, Bennett put in the kind of performance from which one would fervently hope to wake in a panicking sweat. But this one was all too real.  Pressed by Ferrari to explain how the party would pay for its policy of building 500,000 new council houses, Bennett spluttered: \u201cRight, well, that\u2019s, erm ... you\u2019ve got a total cost ... erm ... that we\u2019re ... that will be spelled out in our manifesto.\u201d  \u201cSo you don\u2019t know,\u201d said Ferrari. \u201cNo, well, er ...\u201d One question prompted a four-second pause. Another was met by a mumbled answer that morphed into a fit of coughing.  Disaster turned to farce some hours later at the press conference launching the campaign, when Bennett was asked by a reporter if she had let party members down, a point with which she seemed ready to agree, before Green peer Lady Jones leapt to her feet to declare: \u201cShe\u2019s not going to answer that! No! No! No!\u201d  Bennett spent much of the remainder of the day apologising for her \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201cvery bad\u201d interview, the result, she said, of a \u201cbrain fade\u201d. But that is not the full story of the Greens\u2019 Tuesday. Membership of the party in England and Wales has almost tripled in 18 months to 54,500 and now surpasses that of the Liberal Democrats or Ukip.  And the biggest membership spike in recent weeks came on Tuesday \u2013 in the immediate wake of what some called one of the worst political interviews in history.  Bennett\u2019s Green colleagues have spent the past few days in impassioned defence of their leader, who had explained her coughing to Ferrari by saying she had a \u201cvery bad cold\u201d \u2013 in fact, according to Si\u00e2n Berry, a Green councillor in Bennett\u2019s home borough of Camden, she had been (and still is) suffering from a dose of flu.  \u201cSo no wonder her brain wasn\u2019t working as fast as usual. It\u2019s the nightmare we all have.\u201d Bennett, she said, is \u201cquite fed up with herself with doing the interviews when she knew she wasn\u2019t feeling in a good way\u201d.  Berry added: \u201cThe thing about the Green party is the fact that we have a range of really good people who could have taken over from her in an emergency.  \u201cIt could have been a great way to show that we are a different kind of party and instead we had an ailing leader reinforcing the idea that it\u2019s all about one person.\u201d      Green party MP Caroline Lucas.    Bennett, 49, was born to working class parents in Eastwood, a suburb of Sydney, and became a politicised early, when she was told, at age five \u201cthat I couldn\u2019t have a bicycle because I was a girl, because riding one wasn\u2019t \u2018ladylike\u2019. It was the feeling of growing up in a world where the only heroes were rugby league players \u2013 and they were of course all male, not like me\u201d. Sporty and competitive, she won a scholarship to a private school in the city, before moving to the University of Sydney to study agricultural science.  There, she earned a place on the university football team \u201cby the simple expedient of standing on the field and refusing to move off, since there wasn\u2019t a women\u2019s competition\u201d.  Her mother died in a car crash when she was young, and this helped forge Bennett\u2019s life-long commitment to road safety.  She moved into journalism in Australia and then in Thailand, before relocating to the UK and a job at the Times in 2000. Despite her thick-as-Vegemite accent, Bennett appears to have no great lingering affection for her home country, saying recently: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine going there by choice.\u201d  At the Times, where according to former colleagues she worked as a downtable subeditor, a middle-ranking production role, she was regarded as a loud, friendly and \u201cincredibly earnest\u201d figure whose strong accent occasionally grated and who threw herself into activities such as the paper\u2019s annual staff cricket match, at which her \u201clooping dolly drops\u201d were particularly well remembered. At the Guardian, where Bennett moved in 2007, she was regarded as extremely committed and never less than political.  Former colleagues particularly recall one occasion in which Bennett made an impassioned speech to the morning conference meeting arguing in the discussion of the paper\u2019s options for the future that plenty of emphasis had been put on the internet, but very little on Guardian Weekly, the subscription-based digest of largely international news that Bennett edited at the time. Abby Deveney, now the section\u2019s editor and Bennett\u2019s deputy at the time, describes her as \u201ca force of nature\u201d.  She was surprised to hear her friend stumble on the radio, she said, because \u201cshe\u2019s very good working under pressure quickly. I have seen her do stuff off the cuff journalistically that would make some people haemorrhage from their ears. I don\u2019t know how she pulled it off\u201d.  She took voluntary redundancy from the Guardian in 2012, securing the party\u2019s leadership months later.  Bennett\u2019s own electoral history has never yielded a seat \u2013 she failed in two attempts to be elected as a Green councillor in Camden, was not elected to the London assembly in 2012 and took 2.7% of the vote in the 2010 general election in Holborn and St Pancras, where she will stand again in May.  But she was voted party leader, said Berry, on the strength of her pledges to build up the party by energising grassroots membership, to professionalise its central administration and, most notably, to raise its ambitions.      Sian Berry of the Greens.    With Greens having stood in about 50% of all constituencies in the 2010 election, Bennett told members they should aim to contest 75% in 2015. In fact, the Greens will fight close to 90% of constituencies on 7 May.  \u201cShe wasn\u2019t, in her pitch to the party, making a big thing about being the answer to all our media prayers,\u201d said Berry.  \u201cThat\u2019s not her selling point. Her selling point is party organisation, party support \u2013 giving us goals and strategic direction. That\u2019s what she\u2019s best at in leadership. There\u2019s a lot more to leadership than interviews.\u201d There is, however, an acknowledgement within the party that having fought to be included in the forthcoming debates and given the same level of scrutiny as the other mainstream parties, the Greens need to give Bennett a bit more help with research and briefings.  \u201cWe need to put a much greater support team round our party leader and our deputies,\u201d former leader Caroline Lucas says in an interview in Saturday\u2019s Guardian. \u201cWe are working her to the bone.\u201d  This extra support may be timely, because the uncomfortable truth is that her encounter with Nick Ferrari was not the first time Bennett has had to backpedal on or clarify an interview.  After agreeing with Andrew Neil on the Sunday Politics earlier this month that her party did not think it should be illegal to be a member of al-Qaida or Isis, she later said she \u201cmay not have made it as clear as [she] meant to\u201d, and that \u201cany sort of \u00adinvolvement or membership\u201d in the groups should be illegal.  Last month, she told the Economist that being poor in India was not as bad as being on benefits in Britain \u201cbecause at least everyone else there is poor too\u201d; Bennett later said she had been misrepresented.  It has led, perhaps understandably, to a quiet sense of glee from Labour, the party with most to fear from the Green resurgence.  \u201cLet\u2019s just say we are not threatened by Natalie Bennett\u2019s appearance in the debates,\u201d said one senior Labour source. \u201cEd [Miliband] is often criticised, but at least he knows what he is talking about and he doesn\u2019t get his facts wrong.\u201d Green party insiders, however, insist that they are advocating a radical reinvention about the way we do politics, making an obsession with the numbers on this or that \u2013 particularly when the party will never in reality have to lead a majority government after 7 May \u2013 a red herring.  \u201cIf people vote, what they will vote for is: what\u2019s your vision of society, how are you going to make my life better?\u201d said Molly Scott Cato, a former economics professor who is a Green MEP in southwest England and the party\u2019s spokeswoman on economic affairs.  \u201cObviously we need to support that with costings, but I think the relentless focus on numbers by the media is one of the things that\u2019s turning people off politics.  \u201cLet\u2019s leave some space to talk about what our vision of the future is and how our policies support that as well as talking about the costings.\u201d Rob Ford, senior lecturer in politics at the University of Manchester, agrees that for a certain proportion of the electorate, voting is an \u201cexpressive act. It\u2019s about sending a message\u201d. He added: \u201cSo all this gubbins about the Natalie Bennett brain fade, it won\u2019t matter a bit to people who are motivated like that because they are thinking, I want to send a message, make an expression about what sort of person I am.  \u201cThe leadership qualities of the leader are the not the primary reason deciding their vote.\u201d  In that context, backing an outspoken Australian \u2013 who, if nothing else, certainly sounds very different to her peers \u2013 may yet appeal to many.

These are the hands of The Rocket, the hands of a sporting magician and the best snooker player in history but O\u2019Sullivan spent the morning bunching them into fists in a boxing gym. \u201cI don\u2019t mind if they get hurt,\u201d he says on a sunny afternoon in Chigwell, Essex, \u201cbecause I wouldn\u2019t have to play in the world championships then.\u201d It seems a strange prelude to O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s attempt to become a world champion for a sixth time next month. Stephen Hendry holds the record for world championship wins in the modern game with seven but another title for O\u2019Sullivan would be extraordinary. Snooker is much more competitive now and O\u2019Sullivan has had to conquer the demons of his past and his disillusionment with the sport today. \u201cI know it sounds crazy but I wasn\u2019t even sure if I was going to enter the worlds,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan says. \u201cI probably will but it\u2019s got to the point where I want to give snooker only 20% of my time. So I haven\u2019t entered the worlds yet. I probably will enter but it\u2019s not something I\u2019m that bothered about. \u201cI\u2019ve hardly picked my cue up since playing in Germany about a month ago. I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m just filling up my day with things so I can\u2019t play snooker. I\u2019ve decided I want to box, I\u2019m doing a few other little ventures and I\u2019m filling up my day. Come six o\u2019clock at night I\u2019ve not been near a snooker table.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan is only practising \u201cabout two hours a week\u201d because he would prefer to be a pundit than a world championship participant. Stressing that \u201csnooker has changed\u201d, with prize money and sponsorship opportunities shrinking, O\u2019Sullivan says: \u201cI\u2019m not a businessman but I\u2019m not stupid either. If you go back five or 10 years I used to get good sponsorship for my logos. I was on \u00a3350,000 even before I hit a ball \u2026 now there is no money in snooker. The top players are suffering now. I don\u2019t want it to come across as if I\u2019m doing this for money. I just want what\u2019s fair. I could get by the rest of my life if I never worked again but I want to be valued. Now I\u2019m working with Eurosport I\u2019m opening up new doors. I feel valued by them. That\u2019s where I see my future.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan has given up hope of trying to persuade snooker\u2019s governing body and Barry Hearn, the sport\u2019s dominant promoter, to address the issue of players\u2019 lost revenue: \u201cI\u2019ve had chats with Barry Hearn and he ain\u2019t gonna change it. He said: \u2018Come on, let\u2019s have a meeting.\u2019 But I\u2019ve had enough chat. I know Barry has got his own mindset. It doesn\u2019t suit me. I\u2019m willing to give snooker 10, 15, 20% but I need to do other things where I feel valued. I had the good times but it\u2019s not any good any more. I don\u2019t care what anyone says. They can say you\u2019re getting this amount of prize money. But if you\u2019re a top player it\u2019s fucking shit. I want my security \u2013 and snooker ain\u2019t going to give me that\u00a0security.\u201d The 39-year-old O\u2019Sullivan, ultimately, is more philosophical than strident. \u201cWorking with Steve Peters [the sports psychiatrist who has had such an impact on O\u2019Sullivan, British cycling and Liverpool\u2019s footballers] I\u2019ve realised I\u2019ve hit my head against the wall for enough years. I can\u2019t waste my time with certain people. You just think: \u2018This battle\u2019s not worth\u00a0fighting\u2019.\u201d His latest resistance to snooker seems more reasoned, and resigned, when heard in the context of deeper personal struggles. O\u2019Sullivan was only 16 and playing in an amateur snooker tournament in Bangkok when his father, Ronnie Sr, was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder in 1992. A year later his mother, Maria, was jailed for tax evasion. It seems startling to hear that the teenage O\u2019Sullivan attempted to look after his little sister, Danielle, on his own. \u201cI tried to do the right thing. Mum and dad were away and it was me and my sister. She needed looking after. I didn\u2019t do it that well. I turned to drink, drugs, whatever. My sister was only eight and I didn\u2019t even have a driving licence so I couldn\u2019t get her to school. I didn\u2019t handle it great but I found a way. I\u2019ll get through anything.\u201d How long did he and Danielle live on their own? \u201cI tried to hold it down for three or four weeks but I then took her to my mum\u2019s best friends, and Angie and Ray looked after her \u2013 which was the right thing to do.\u201d His mother spent only a brief spell in prison and his father was released in 2010 after 18 years. \u201cHe\u2019s adapted pretty well,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan says of his dad. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to be easy and I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever adapt completely but he\u2019s got a nice routine and lots of friends. He\u2019s spending time with me and Danielle. He\u2019s doing pretty well when you think of his environment the last 20 years. He\u2019s embracing every minute of being out. He\u2019s appreciative of his freedom.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan appears most appreciative of his children. He remembers the courage of his nine-year-old daughter, Lily, in a cross-country race last year with such warmth it seems more significant than his recent world record of 776 century breaks. \u201cI was so proud of her, man. She ran for her school in the district. There were 11 schools and I was nervous for her because you\u2019re on your own out there. \u201cSo they set off and she\u2019s overtaking girls and by the last 100m she\u2019s coming third. Fucking hell! She\u2019s running in the field outside. I\u2019m racing along the bushes shouting: \u2018C\u2019mon Lil, relax your shoulders, keep it going \u2026\u2019 When she came back into the school for the finish I\u2019ve never seen anyone so tired. \u201cLily had nothing left. Two girls overtook her and she came fifth. But she crossed the line having given 250%. My daughter\u2019s got more guts and determination than me. She was born with tenacity \u2013 a great quality.\u201d Is little Ronnie, a year younger, equally tenacious? \u201cHe\u2019s lazier but he\u2019s talented. Everything he does comes easy to him. He could study harder but he\u2019s still top of the class. He\u2019s a quick learner, that boy. I show him how to play snooker and, bang, he\u2019s got it. Oh, he\u2019s a lovely boy. He\u2019s beautiful. He\u2019s a handsome little fucker. He don\u2019t take after me, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan will leave his family next month and, despite his misgivings, almost certainly play in the world championship in Sheffield. \u201cIt\u2019s probably one of my least favourite tournaments,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cSeventeen days is too long. \u201cBut, as a kid, I dreamed of being a world champion. It took me a while to win my first world title but once I\u2019d done it success tasted nice. I thought if I can win three or four that would be great. One could be a fluke. Two? Some people have won two. Three? You\u2019re getting to be a great player. Four? You\u2019re on a level with John Higgins who is a master of the game. So I\u2019m really happy to have won it five times.\u201d He smiles at a mention of Hendry\u2019s seven titles. \u201cWe\u2019ll let him keep that one. I ain\u2019t chasing that. I really like my life now. I\u2019ve accepted that five is good and snooker is no longer what it once was for me. I just use snooker \u2026 rather than letting it use me.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan has had a few world championship meltdowns at The Crucible. In the 2006 semi-final he was tied at 8-8 against Graeme Dott when he lost eight frames in a row. \u201cDott\u2019s a good, tough player. He\u2019s like a Jack Russell, snapping away, but he\u2019s never going to play a phenomenal game that blows you away. I was struggling mentally. I couldn\u2019t deal with my thoughts and emotions. I just kind of imploded and sabotaged it. I wanted to lose. I had a fucking meltdown. If I\u2019d have won that match I would have had to play Peter fucking Ebdon for two days. I would\u2019ve been in the mental house but I can deal with emotions much better now because of [the sports psychiatrist] Steve\u00a0Peters. \u201cI\u2019ll get through it and tomorrow\u2019s another day. I\u2019ve been a lot more successful because of that attitude. Steve\u2019s a master of the mind and I\u2019ve probably got 70% of it right now. That\u2019s enough for me to be successful and be the person I want to be. So I only see him two or three times a year now. Part of me is not willing to invest more time because I\u2019m playing snooker more for fun now.\u201d He lost in the world championship final last year to Mark Selby and it\u2019s clear that defeat wounded him. \u201cI didn\u2019t play well that whole tournament and it was stuttery against Selby. I was disappointed that I\u2019d lost to someone \u2026 put it this way, I\u2019d much rather than lost to someone like Ding [Junhui] or \u2026 who else is there? I can\u2019t think of anyone. I want someone to play the right shots, my kind of shots. I get baffled watching Selby. It\u2019s effective but his white ball is all over the place and sometimes you think he\u2019s gonna clear up and then he\u2019s out of position. It\u2019s an unsettling style. I\u2019d much rather play Stephen Hendry, John Higgins, Ding, Judd Trump. So last year was difficult for me to deal with.\u201d He admits to being \u201ctaken apart\u201d by Neil Robertson in the Masters two months ago when O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s 15-match winning streak ended in a 6-1 defeat to the world No1. Yet the feeling lingers that, should the mood take him, a sixth world title is possible. \u201cI\u2019m capable of winning it,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll only go there with the appetite to win. I\u2019m at that stage where I appreciate every win. I never did before. Now I think \u2018Fucking hell, I\u2019ve got the UK title, the Champions Cup \u2026\u2019 It\u2019s not a good sign because it shows you\u2019re coming to the end. But, in human terms, it\u2019s a good sign.\u201d We go out into the garden and O\u2019Sullivan talks about his boxing sparring partners. \u201cThey\u2019re old-school boys ranging from 30 to 73. They\u2019re all different. Mick the Greek is a big, strong guy who comes forward and hits hard. But they\u2019re great, giving me tips, and it\u2019s good to learn new things. I believe there\u2019s an art to everything. You can do it either really well or really bad. The great ones just make it easy. \u201cWe only hit to the body. It hurts but I said to one guy, \u2018I love this\u2019. He looked at me and said: \u2018You\u2019re mad.\u2019 But I quite enjoy getting a few digs to the ribs. As long as you don\u2019t kill me or break a rib, I\u2019m all right. Pain is nothing. It comes and goes. I\u2019ve had a great day so far \u2013 and it\u2019s because of the boxing. It\u2019s either that or sitting in your bed, waiting for something to happen.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan grins as he remembers how Simon Hattenstone, his friend and the Guardian writer, \u201cwas on the campaign trail with Ed Miliband. Simon told me: \u2018Ed\u2019s a fucking fan\u2019. Simon phones me and says: \u2018\u2018\u2018Ere, speak to someone.\u2019 Fucking Ed Miliband. I was on the phone for 10 minutes. I had to pull over because this could be the next prime minister. Most of the time I was saying: \u2018Ed, I gotta go, it\u2019s a terrible signal.\u2019 But, in the end, I just said: \u2018Good luck, mate.\u2019 We all need it.\u201d The Rocket accepts a snooker cue. \u201cIt\u2019s not your normal wand,\u201d Tom Jenkins, the photographer, says. \u201cNo,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan smiles as he holds the strange cue lovingly. \u201cBut I bet I could turn it into a wand \u2026\u201d British Eurosport is showing 19 snooker tournaments per season including the World Championship, 18 April to 4 May.", "publicationDate": "2015-03-17T11:08:00Z", "tags": ["Ronnie O'Sullivan", "World Snooker Championship", "Sport", "Snooker"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/mar/17/ronnie-osullivan-snooker-world-championship", "title": "Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan: \u2018I just use snooker rather than letting it use me\u2019", "sentences": ["O\u2019Sullivan was only 16 and playing in an amateur snooker tournament in Bangkok when his father, Ronnie Sr, was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder in 1992."]}, {"article": "Bangkok\u2019s Lumpini Park is walking distance from the Italian bistro where Dream works as the head waitress. This afternoon, a\u00a0cool Saturday in mid- January, the 32-year-old Thai has taken a couple of hours off to attend a festival in the park. The grass has only just grown back. It was scrubby and nicotine-hued for months last year after thousands of occupying protesters erected tents, noodle stalls and pop-up hair salons during efforts to topple the elected government. A military coup last May granted the protesters\u2019 wishes. Now the junta is using the park to stage a five-day extravaganza, Discover Thainess 2015, to showcase how united and happy the country is under martial law. The area has been transformed into a mini-Thailand. Different sections represent the five main regions, each crammed with colourful stalls selling local food and crafts. There are stages for cultural performances, and backdrops of idyllic beaches and lush rice paddies for photo sessions. (One stall sells nothing but selfie sticks.) In Dream\u2019s home region, the North, people who are dressed as cheery peasants pose beside plastic water buffaloes. In the Central region, home to the capital, dancers in glittering costumes perform a graceful routine from the royal court. Dream moved to Bangkok seven years ago from Nan province, close to the border with Laos. She earned her English nickname because she was always so aspirational. \u201cMy parents grew rice and vegetables for a\u00a0living. There was too much poverty, too little food,\u201d she says. \u201cI did well at school and found work in hotels when I was 18. I wanted a better life.\u201d Dressed for the festival in a smart black skirt and a high-necked blouse adorned with a cameo necklace, she is enjoying the lavish spectacle. She is also bemused. \u201cIt\u2019s like 20 or 30 years ago. It\u2019s not like Thailand today.\u201d Harking back to an idealised past, when irksome democracy was containable and everyone knew their place, is one of the festival\u2019s aims. The event is ostensibly to promote tourism, but it\u2019s also thudding domestic propaganda. The theme is based on the \u201c12 core values of the Thai people\u201d that coup leader and now prime minister General Prayuth Chan-ocha compiled after seizing power. The values include: \u201cLove for the nation, religion and the monarchy\u201d; \u201cPreserving Thai customs and traditions\u201d and \u201cDiscipline and respect for elders and the rule of law\u201d. All Thai school-children are required to recite the 12 sayings daily and, to prove that feudal values can also be fun, the junta has issued downloadable stickers for Thai messaging apps.     Eyes right: General Prayuth Chan-ocha at a military ceremony. Disagreeing with his path, he has declared, is incompatible with the very nature of \u2018Thainess\u2019. Photograph: Rungroj Yongrit/EPA    There\u2019s no greater way of showing contempt for the rule of law than by removing an elected government, however flawed, at gunpoint. But such inconsistencies don\u2019t trouble Prayuth. The general justified the coup \u2013 Thailand\u2019s 12th since absolute monarchy ended in 1932 \u2013 by claiming it was necessary to quash instability resulting from the country\u2019s deep political divide. Thailand has been in a state of almost perpetual tumult for a decade. On one side are those who believe in civil society and democratic principles, including the devoted supporters of exiled former leader Thaksin Shinawatra and his populist party machine. On the other side are those loyal to the old ruling elite, an embedded alliance of the Thai monarchy, military and upper classes whose traditional power is being usurped. After the coup, Prayuth suspended the constitution and restricted all basic rights. He vowed to \u201creturn happiness to the people\u201d and create a\u00a0system of \u201cThai-style democracy\u201d through political reforms of the junta\u2019s own design. Earlier in the week, during his speech to launch the festival, Prayuth made it clear how high the stakes were for every citizen. Disagreeing with his path, he declared, was incompatible with the very nature of \u201cThainess\u201d. \u201cWhoever causes chaos to Thailand or disrupts peace and order, they should not be recognised as Thais, because Thais do not destroy each other,\u201d the general told an audience of dignitaries gathered outside a shopping mall. \u201cThe charm of the Thai people is that they look lovely even when they do nothing, because they have smiles,\u201d he added, without bothering to demonstrate his point. Prayuth insists his only goal is national reconciliation. But Dream says his regime will make many Thais feel more excluded. As a\u00a0transgender woman, she is a case in point. \u201cOf course I am worried in case the army clamps down on people like me,\u201d she tells me later in the evening, back at the homely Italian restaurant where she works. \u201cI don\u2019t fit into their ideal.\u201d What upsets her most is that the junta\u2019s pronouncements render her opinions worthless. \u201cI\u2019m proud of myself. I\u2019ve worked hard to improve my life and I believe in equality and freedom for poor people. But now we are being told that if we don\u2019t accept the army\u2019s decisions, we are criminals.\u201d When General Prayuth does smile, which is not very often, he looks like a man suffering from heartburn. He probably is. The 61-year-old junta boss has repeatedly complained that he didn\u2019t ask for the job of reforming democracy and that he is selflessly doing it for the nation. \u201cMy whole family cried tears when I told them I was going to do this task,\u201d he told the Thai media, shortly before his hand-picked interim parliament appointed him as prime minister. A career soldier known as a hardline royalist, Prayuth had been due to retire last year and spend his salad days playing golf. Still, his belief that his methods are the only righteous solution to Thailand\u2019s problems is not in doubt. Neither is his faith in his own authority. As the number of coups indicates, the Thai army\u2019s sanctioned role as political troubleshooter is long-standing. Prayuth looks painfully exasperated when Thai reporters gently query his reform plans. He told one journalist to \u201cvisit the ear doctor\u201d and threw a\u00a0banana skin at the head of a cameraman. Earlier this month he warned a press gathering that he could do much worse. \u201cI was asked by a reporter: \u2018What are the results of the government\u2019s work?\u2019 I almost punched the person who questioned me in the face.\u201d The warning was redundant. Since taking over, the junta, whose official name is the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), has made full use of martial law to prosecute opponents, ban political activity and censor the media. More than 1,000 people, including academics, political bloggers, activists and politicians, have been detained or sent for \u201cattitude adjustment\u201d at military installations. There have been some allegations of torture. Prosecutions under the country\u2019s strict l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 laws, which protect the monarchy from insult, have also risen sharply. In its annual report in January, Human Rights Watch said military rule had sent human rights in Thailand into \u201ca freefall\u201d. During the previous coup in 2006, the mood was comparatively less repressive. The move ousted Thaksin Shinawatra from office while he was on an overseas trip. The army rallied peacefully to return life to normal. Thaksin, a\u00a0former telecoms tycoon who came to power in 2001, built a huge support base among mostly rural voters by being the first Thai leader to introduce policies that genuinely improved their lives, such as universal health care and microcredit loans. But he also grew increasingly despotic and corrupt as his power expanded, turning the urban elite\u2019s distaste for him into outright loathing. Thaksin and his allies became synonymous with bad government. Tolerance for democracy was the main casualty.     A family affai: Winyu \u2018John\u2019 Wongsurawat co-hosts Shallow News in Depth, Thailand\u2019s most popular political satire TV show with his brother-in-law Nattapong Tiendee while his sister Janya \u2018Rosie\u2019 Wongsurawat is the lead writer. Photograph: Chang Li-mei/Observer    This coup felt different from the start. In the years since 2006, grassroots supporters of Thaksin and his younger sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, who became prime minister in his absence in 2011, had become much more organised. Seeing their gains under threat, they clashed with the army and pro-establishment demonstrators numerous times to safeguard their votes. Thaksin-backed parties have won every election for the past 14 years. By last year, with Thailand\u2019s long-ruling 87-year-old monarch King Bhumibol Adulyadej in fragile health, and no viable opposition in parliament, the Bangkok powers were running out of time. They needed to crush support for the Shinawatra clan once and for all, and rig the constitution to keep elected leaders in check in future. The generals\u2019 failure to grasp that the Shinawatras are only a symbol of much wider demands for social change and equality is the central flaw in their plan. Anti-coup demonstrators were quick to latch on to dystopian symbolism in protest. Some people took part in \u201creading protests\u201d by standing in public reading George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four, and the three-fingered salute from The Hunger Games films became a mark of resistance. The army was equally quick to crack down, hauling offenders off for \u201cattitude adjustment\u201d or worse. Life began to outdo art. After martial law outlawed political gatherings of more than five people, students at one university organised \u201csandwich parties\u201d \u2013 sit-ins in the guise of innocently eating lunch. The idea spread. The army detained a number of people for \u201ceating sandwiches with political intent\u201d and warned the public this was now a criminal act. Recently, the junta arrested a man for staging a solo \u201cwalking protest\u201d in Bangkok. If such state-sponsored farce in one of southeast Asia\u2019s most modern capitals suggests there is panic beneath the junta\u2019s brute power, its desperate need for its actions to be seen in a positive light confirms it. It has toned down its \u201cHappiness\u201d campaign from the early days, when it held street parties to promote reconciliation, offering free haircuts, dancing by women in sexy camouflage gear and hot meals. Prayuth even penned a\u00a0ballad, \u201cReturn Happiness to Thailand\u201d, that was broadcast so often it became a tyranny of its own. (Musical ability seems to run in the family. Prayuth\u2019s 20-something twin daughters enjoyed brief success a few years ago as a\u00a0punk-lite pop duo called BADZ \u2013 a biographical detail now hard to find.) But still, the doublethink pronouncements are relentless. \u201cIf people want to do [opinion] polls, they are free to do so,\u201d said Prayuth at Government House last month. \u201cBut if the polls oppose the NCPO, that is not allowed,\u201d he added. A few days later an \u201cindependent\u201d poll was published giving the regime a public approval rating of more than 80%. Earlier the junta had outlined its position on media censorship in a similar fashion. After summoning editors from Thailand\u2019s mainstream media to a meeting, the appointee in charge of media monitoring, Lt Gen Suchai Pongput, explained: \u201cWe do not limit media freedom, but freedom must be within limits.\u201d     Sign of the times: an anti-government protester holds up a placard depicting former self-exhiled Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra during a march through Bangkok. Photograph: Rufus Cox/Getty Images    Cherry, a 27-year-old reporter and talk-show panellist at one of Bangkok\u2019s independent TV stations, has discovered firsthand what this means in practical terms. I meet her at her office off a sprawling ringroad, but she has little work to do there, as she has been suspended by her bosses. \u201cI posted a status update on my Facebook page, a kind of inspirational message for women, saying that we should speak out for what we believe even if we have to pay a\u00a0high price,\u201d says Cherry, who, to protect her TV company, can\u2019t give her full Thai name. \u201cUnderneath I posted a photo of myself at a big anti-coup demonstration.\u201d Her bosses saw the update and said they were taking her off air, at least for a while. \u201cThey told me they couldn\u2019t trust me any more. They were worried I might criticise the military on live TV.\u201d The Thai media has never been entirely free; self-censorship about the monarchy and the Buddhist monkhood is practised across the board. But in those cases the parameters of what\u2019s allowable are clearly defined (that is, nothing negative at all, although criticism of religion has begun to creep in). Cherry says the junta\u2019s \u201crequest\u201d that media outlets determine their own limits when reporting on the military government is more damaging. \u201cWhen they don\u2019t draw the line for you, when you have to draw it yourself, it results in paranoia and over-caution. It\u2019s the worst kind of silencing.\u201d It\u2019s also the most insidiously effective because it forces colleagues to police each other. The army closed down Cherry\u2019s TV station for a month after the coup for \u201cinappropriate reporting\u201d and later gave it a yellow card, referee-style, to warn that it would be closed down again if it went too far. \u201cEveryone at work is a nervous wreck.\u201d Cherry is the only daughter of upper middle-class parents who live in Bangkok\u2019s suburbs and run a successful bakery business. Her parents are liberal, she says, but most of her relatives are firmly on the side of the coup. Cherry was studying global politics at the London School of Economics in 2006 when mass demonstrations first started up in her homeland. \u201cThat\u2019s when I became really engaged. I believe passionately in democracy and civil society.\u201d It\u2019s a tragedy for Thailand, she says, that the nation is being excluded from debate about its future. \u201cI talk politics with some of my friends, and they have very bright minds that are being wasted.\u201d So, of course, is her own. Two weeks after I\u00a0meet her, her wrap-on-the-knuckles suspension is lifted. She\u2019s allowed to return to her talk show as a panellist on the strict condition that she doesn\u2019t say anything that the junta would regard as \u201cun-Thai\u201d.

Photograph: Chang Li-mei/Observer    Children\u2019s Day in Thailand, in January, is the only day of the year that Government House opens to the public. Balloons are strung up around the lawns and youngsters can have guided tours of the seat of power. This year that turned out to be literal: it was all about the chair. Prayuth had recently received a new Baroque-style chair for his office. A\u00a0leaflet was handed out about the making of the chair by master craftsmen. As the highlight of the day, children were allowed to sit in it to have their photos taken beside a cardboard cutout of its proud owner. He even wore a\u00a0painless smile. Despite Prayuth\u2019s protestations to the contrary, it seemed like he plans to sit in his new chair for quite a long time. The general keeps changing his mind about the timetable for elections, saying that they could be any time between next year and three years away. One sharp-eyed Thai blogger noted that the ID cards of members of the National Legislative Assembly, the interim parliament appointed by Prayuth, are valid until 2020. Two recent small explosions of grenades and pipe bombs in Bangkok\u2019s city centre, blamed on agitators, prompted Prayuth to confirm this month that martial law would stay in place until there was \u201ctotal stability\u201d. Meanwhile the troubled Thai economy is stagnating further and the country\u2019s image abroad is looking shakier by the day. Prayuth\u2019s chair is not his only eccentricity. Apparently unschooled in public relations or political spin, he makes off-the-cuff remarks that provide endless light relief for Thailand\u2019s political bloggers and tweeters. During one economic forum, he suggested that rubber farmers should \u201csell their product on Mars\u201d to reduce their stockpile of rubber. He also told the poor to alleviate household debt \u201cby stopping shopping\u201d. In one of his weekly televised addresses, he said all residents of Bangkok should solve the problem of overgrowing water hyacinths in the river \u201cby picking 10 or 20 plants each until they go extinct\u201d. He signed off another broadcast with the words: \u201cLove me just a little, but love me for a long time\u2026\u201d from a famous Thai song. Responding to suggestions by pro-coup pundits that he should be more statesman-like, he was adamant: \u201cI won\u2019t change my personality, because I am a person with multiple personalities.\u201d As with other interesting despots, none of this affects his ability to wield absolute power. But it does pose a problem for those who are in the business of poking fun at him to make serious political points. As Janya \u201cRosie\u201d Wongsurawat says, it\u2019s hard to produce satire when your targets are already beyond it in real life. Janya, 38, is the chief writer and director of Shallow News in Depth, an online TV show hosted by her younger brother Winyu \u201cJohn\u201d Wongsurawat and her husband, Nattapong Tiendee. The family trio founded the humorous news show six years ago to try to get more young people engaged in the country\u2019s problems. Their audience has risen dramatically since the start of military rule. Around 250,000 viewers now watch each episode of their cleverly subversive take on post-coup antics. The team covers complex political issues, wrapping them up in enough slapstick comedy, funny graphics and sarcasm to keep it all light on the surface. \u201cIn Thailand people don\u2019t take clowns seriously, so we haven\u2019t had any visits from the army yet,\u201d says Janya, sitting in the studio they\u2019ve recently created in the lobby of a\u00a0disused Bangkok office building. \u201cSarcasm is a\u00a0useful weapon because it\u2019s not common in Thai humour. People are not sure how to take it.\u201d In the show Winyu, 29, is a cartoonish James Bond figure, while Nattapong, 39, is a shaman in a white robe and beads. Against the neon-hued set, the two sit at a desk and use props like fly swatters and rubber ducks to ham it up while they deliver serious verbal blows to Prayuth\u2019s regime. \u201cThis week our nation remains in a runaway state of absurdity and shows no sign of slowing down,\u201d announces Winyu in one recent episode. The pair then name and shame many of the 220 members of the junta-appointed interim parliament who have no experience or qualifications for their posts except their ties to the army. \u201cThey are volunteering their incompetence in the service of our nation. Now, let\u2019s move on to our absurd news\u2026\u201d In another show they expose how the legislature is making surreptitious changes to the Minerals Act. Newly added clauses remove state liability for accidents and do away with environmental impact assessments. \u201cSo if a mine explodes, it\u2019s the fault of the miners. Of course it is.\u201d They also discuss how martial law is being used to quash environmental protests by local people about certain government projects and rush the projects through. \u201cDuring the rule of phony governments like this, it\u2019s a prime time for pushing crazy, unjust laws that would probably be much harder to pass during a\u00a0legitimate government,\u201d says Nattapong, brandishing his plastic fly swatter. Winyu says it\u2019s nerve-wracking every time they upload a\u00a0new episode. \u201cSome coup supporters are outraged. They tweet the link directly to the army with comments like: \u2018You\u2019re really letting them get away with this?\u2019\u201d But he says doing the show is also a form of therapy \u2013 for him, and hopefully for the viewers as well: \u201cIt\u2019s a release, an outlet for the frustration of what\u2019s happening.\u201d Janya and Winyu are the offspring of a Thai politics professor, and their American mother is also an academic. \u201cWe do have serious discussions about politics with the family, but we also have to joke about it as well,\u201d says Janya, \u201cotherwise it\u2019s very lonely to be in this situation. The propaganda just keeps coming and coming. It\u2019s really bad for your psyche.\u201d A month to THE DAY after the Discover Thainess festival in Lumpini Park, another event takes place not far across town. It\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day, a muggy Saturday afternoon, and a group calling itself Resistant Citizen is staging a rare anti-coup protest in the middle of the Siam Square shopping district. Advertising the event in advance, the group of activists, students, academics and lawyers made no attempt to hide its illegal plans. The aim of coming out in public was to \u201cbreak the atmosphere of fear created by military rule,\u201d they announced. Thirty protesters arrive in tuk-tuks bearing homemade ballot boxes, bunches of red roses and copies of Nineteen Eighty-Four. They plan to stage a\u00a0mock election to mark the one-year anniversary of the general election in February 2014 called by the then prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra, which was invalidated after the conservative opposition sabotaged the polls and in some cases attacked voters. \u201cMy beloved, stolen election\u201d reads one sign. \u201cOne heart, one election\u201d reads another. An air of inevitability hangs over the proceedings. Around 150 police officers have already put up barricades and formed a cordon around the plaza. \u201cThis is a day of love for all Thais,\u201d says one activist wearing a T-shirt with the slogan NO COUP and clutching a red rose. \u201cWe\u2019ve come here to let it be known that we want freedom and social justice for everyone in our country.\u201d Standing back surveying the unfolding protest, police colonel Jarut Sarutthayaporn, the policeman in charge, says that holding demonstrations like this is counterproductive. The protesters are \u201cinterrupting the programme\u201d and delaying democracy because elections will not be held until all dissent is eradicated. Nevertheless, everyone lets the peaceful event play out. The activists put up the ballot boxes; the police dismantle them. People try to give speeches; the police stop those, too. Scuffles break out and four protesters are arrested, bundled off to the station in the same tuk-tuks they arrived in. (The four were later charged with holding an illegal political gathering and are currently being tried in a military court.) When the event is over and everyone has gone home, shoppers continue to stream along the concrete pedestrian walkways that snake above the plaza. Beneath them at street level, the ground is strewn with trampled red roses.", "publicationDate": "2015-03-22T06:00:02Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Politics", "Human rights"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/22/bangkok-big-brother-politics-ruling-party-democracy", "title": "Bangkok\u2019s Big Brother is watching you", "sentences": ["Bangkok\u2019s Lumpini Park is walking distance from the Italian bistro where Dream works as the head waitress.", "Dream moved to Bangkok seven years ago from Nan province, close to the border with Laos.", "By last year, with Thailand\u2019s long-ruling 87-year-old monarch King Bhumibol Adulyadej in fragile health, and no viable opposition in parliament, the Bangkok powers were running out of time.", "Recently, the junta arrested a man for staging a solo \u201cwalking protest\u201d in Bangkok.", "After summoning editors from Thailand\u2019s mainstream media to a meeting, the appointee in charge of media monitoring, Lt Gen Suchai Pongput, explained: \u201cWe do not limit media freedom, but freedom must be within limits.\u201d     Sign of the times: an anti-government protester holds up a placard depicting former self-exhiled Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra during a march through Bangkok.", "Photograph: Rufus Cox/Getty Images    Cherry, a 27-year-old reporter and talk-show panellist at one of Bangkok\u2019s independent TV stations, has discovered firsthand what this means in practical terms.", "\u201cEveryone at work is a nervous wreck.\u201d Cherry is the only daughter of upper middle-class parents who live in Bangkok\u2019s suburbs and run a successful bakery business.", "An anti-coup activist fights off being restrained during a demonstration in central Bangkok on Valentines Day after handing out roses and copies of George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-four.", "Two recent small explosions of grenades and pipe bombs in Bangkok\u2019s city centre, blamed on agitators, prompted Prayuth to confirm this month that martial law would stay in place until there was \u201ctotal stability\u201d.", "In one of his weekly televised addresses, he said all residents of Bangkok should solve the problem of overgrowing water hyacinths in the river \u201cby picking 10 or 20 plants each until they go extinct\u201d.", "\u201cIn Thailand people don\u2019t take clowns seriously, so we haven\u2019t had any visits from the army yet,\u201d says Janya, sitting in the studio they\u2019ve recently created in the lobby of a\u00a0disused Bangkok office building."]}, {"article": "Dozens of examples of harrowing cruelty towards animals in zoos have been overlooked by the world\u2019s top zoo organisation, animal welfare groups have alleged. Zoos belonging to the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (Waza) have been filmed over the past five years making animals perform dangerous tricks, confining them to inadequate premises and beating them, contrary to Waza\u2019s code of ethics, which demands the \u201chighest standard of animal welfare\u201d. In November, an animal keeper at Mysore zoo in India was filmed beating an elephant, and Taman Safari in Indonesia runs a travelling dolphin circus in which dolphins are forced to jump through flaming hoops. Tourists are also able to pose with tigers for photos. Zoo Negara in Malaysia has been condemned by a local MP for the terrible condition of its animals, and Dehiwala Zoo in Sri Lanka has come under fire after the deaths of a hippo, a lion and all the zoo\u2019s penguins. The zoo has also been criticised for an elephant show in which handlers threaten the animals with sticks to make them do tricks.  A manacled performing elephant has been filmed at Dusit Zoo in Bangkok, and Almaty zoo in Kazakhstan and the National Taiwan Aquarium have been accused of housing bears and beluga whales, respectively, in sub-standard enclosures. In 2009, a South Korean TV show filmed a small, terrified bear being placed inside a tiger enclosure at Everland Park. All these zoos are members of Waza, a Switzerland-based organisation that acts as the peak member body for the world\u2019s zoos. As revealed by the Guardian, Waza is being taken to court by an Australian conservation group over its alleged complicity in the infamous dolphin hunts in Taiji, Japan.    Related: World's top zoo organisation accused of links to Taiji dolphin slaughter in Japan    Waza\u2019s code of ethics states that where animals are used in performances by zoos, they must \u201cfocus on natural behaviour\u201d and \u201cnot demean of trivialise the animal in any way\u201d. It states: \u201cWaza and its members should make all efforts in their power to encourage substandard zoos and aquariums to improve and reach appropriate standards. If it is clear that the funding or the will to improve is not there, Waza would support the closure of such zoos and aquariums.\u201d Despite these stipulations, Waza has confirmed that no zoo featured in the videos of alleged cruelty has been expelled, or publicly or privately condemned.  Waza has more than 300 individual zoo members, including London Zoo, the Zoological Society of San Diego, Toronto Zoo, Bronx Zoo and Melbourne Zoo. Sarah Lucas, head of Australia for Dolphins, which is leading the court action against Waza, said the organisation was too closely wedded to the interests of its members. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to find abuses in these zoos \u2013 elephants being beaten or bears being kept in tiny, grimy cages \u2013 but Waza doesn\u2019t call out its members on any of these abuses,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to form the view that Waza is an organisation that protects its members\u2019 interests above that of the animals. \u201cMany of the zoos and aquariums do take the code of ethics seriously, but there\u2019s clearly a significant number that don\u2019t and Waza itself doesn\u2019t take it seriously. They need to enforce it, to take action. They\u2019ve either got to do their job or stop pretending to be a policeman for zoos and aquariums.\u201d Lucas said Waza\u2019s dual role as a voice for zoos and a conservation organisation was \u201cinherently conflicted\u201d. Waza has previously expelled zoos for breaches of conduct, such as Johannesburg Zoo for the illegal importation of animals last year. A spokeswoman for Waza said it took \u201creputable and reasonable complaints\u201d very seriously. She said there had been no complaints over any of the examples of abuse highlighted by the Guardian, but that the man filmed beating an elephant at Mysore zoo had been fired.  The claims have raised concerns among Waza members, with one, Kolmarden Zoo in Sweden, weighing up whether to quit the organisation. The director of the zoo, Mats H\u00f6ggren, said he could not be part of the same organisation as the Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums, which takes dolphins from the Taiji hunt. \u201cWe can\u2019t be even indirectly associated, that\u2019s not possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feel horrible about what\u2019s happening over there and we need to put pressure on Waza to do something. \u201cWe will wait a little longer but there needs to be something constructive or we will terminate our membership, for sure.\u201d H\u00f6ggren sits on the executive committee of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria, and said it would also discuss Waza membership.  Sir Richard Branson has added his voice to the condemnation of Waza\u2019s link to the dolphin hunts.  \u201cI was shocked to learn that the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums, which is meant to protect animals, has members that are heavily involved in the horrific capture of dolphins in Japan,\u201d the Virgin founder said in a statement.  \u201cI join with Australia for Dolphins in calling on Waza to end its support for these organisations, and to end its toleration of taking animals from the wild using traumatic methods. Waza is the world\u2019s peak captivity body and it should take a strong stance \u2013 no dolphins or whales should be captured from the sea ever again.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2015-03-24T19:19:18Z", "tags": ["Animal welfare", "Wildlife", "Animals", "World news", "Malaysia", "India", "South Korea", "Indonesia", "Sri Lanka", "Conservation", "Switzerland"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/25/worlds-leading-zoo-association-overlooked-horrific-cruelty-to-animals", "title": "World's leading zoo association accused of overlooking horrific cruelty", "sentences": ["A manacled performing elephant has been filmed at Dusit Zoo in Bangkok, and Almaty zoo in Kazakhstan and the National Taiwan Aquarium have been accused of housing bears and beluga whales, respectively, in sub-standard enclosures."]}, {"article": "He had a mullet. Hair that was brown with sun-bleached, wavy highlights: short around the face and longer at the back. He had dark sunglasses and platform trainers. His trousers had a slight flare at the ankle and on top he wore a denim waistcoat. It was the early 1980s and my mother had sent me to buy some groceries in our little coastal town of Point Reyes, California. This remarkable man \u2013 I remember him as my disco prince \u2013 was walking in front of me as I made my way from the car park, into the Palace market. I stayed a pace behind him as I gathered the carrots and avocados on my mum\u2019s shopping list. The man picked up a small brown paper bag and filled it with what looked like miniature oval oranges. I watched as he ate them whole, right out of the bag, peel and all, while meandering through the fresh section. They weren\u2019t on my list, but as soon as he turned the corner, I filled a brown bag with them, too. At seven or eight years old, this strange and confident man caught my attention first with his appearance, and second with his appetite. I\u2019d never seen kumquats before, but I immediately wanted to try them. This moment started a culinary journey for me. A sort of \u201cmonkey see, monkey do\u201d way of eating. To this day, no matter where I go, I look around to see what the local people are eating, then go straight over and try some myself. This idea that local folk know what\u2019s good to eat is attractive \u2013 and useful \u2013 no matter where you are in the world. I\u2019ve used it to good effect walking through the souks in Marrakech, backpacking in Bangkok, driving down the Baja California peninsula, and cruising through the French hills in a caravan. You will never go wrong if, when in Rome, you eat as the Romans eat. I remember my backpacking days in Central America in the late 1990s and being so surprised that some of my fellow travellers opted for American chain restaurants over the pupuseria (a restaurant serving the Salvadorian corn dish, pupusa, or stuffed corn tortillas) that my friend and I had sought out in San Salvador. \u201cHow will you know if it\u2019s good?\u201d they asked. \u201cJust look at all the locals eating there,\u201d we replied. They pointed out that their fast-food restaurant was full of locals, too \u2013 it was a fair point, but the customer base was different. The pupuseria had hungry working men inside: the truck drivers, the labourers. And while the fast-food chain also had locals inside, they were the ones with money. They were there more to flash their cash than feed their souls \u2013 which I\u2019ve always thought to be something else entirely. It\u2019s a relatively simple equation: if a lot of people are standing around eating the same thing, it\u2019s probably good, fresh food that\u2019s worth waiting for. A line out of the door means that whatever is being served there is so good that everyone wants some. I call it the \u201chuddle theory\u201d. It\u2019s been proved by the buckwheat cake recipe below, which has been on the menu in various guises at Violet for a few months now. We\u2019ve made it with apples, pears, figs and rhubarb, but with kumquat it is an absolute revelation. Huddles have gathered outside the bakery since the kumquat buckwheat cake came on, and it\u2019s continued to sell out. I can see why: pop a kumquat into your mouth and you\u2019ll experience the sweet, sharp, paper-thin peel that bursts to reveal the sour fruit within. Lightly poached, drained and loosely scattered over the cake, they take on a new, brighter quality and go brilliantly with nutty buckwheat flour (which, despite its confusing name, is no relation to wheat and is gluten-free), ground almonds and syrup. Testing and tasting this recipe, I couldn\u2019t resist the opportunity to pick at the kumquats \u2013 a brief seasonal delight \u2013 and, once again, was reminded of that first solo culinary adventure buying groceries for my mother, and of encountering my disco prince with his mullet, flares, shades and \u2013 yes \u2013 his kumquats.

But for a post-promotion pre-season P45 we must head to the Bundesliga and the hapless Mainz manager Jorn Andersen. The bulk of the Norwegian\u2019s playing days had been spent in Germany and his managerial career was following suit. He had arrived at the Stadion am Bruchweg in the summer of 2008 after a pretty miserable time with Kickers Offenbach. Mainz had finished just outside the promotion places and had their sights set on a return to the top flight. Anderson duly delivered, with the team finishing runners-up to the champions Freiburg. Only one man had previously led Mainz into the Bundesliga \u2013 J\u00fcrgen Klopp in 2003-04 \u2013 and things had worked out pretty well for him. Not so for Anderson. Before the club could kick their season off with the visit of Bayer Leverkusen, Anderson was out on his ear \u2013 only six days before the opener. \u201cWe evaluated the situation, discussed it internally and explained in frank terms to Jorn Andersen what the philosophy of the club was,\u201d said the club president Harald Strutz. \u201cAt the end of these discussions, we concluded that our vision and his were not compatible.\u201d Mainz had, as Daniel Bickermann points out, lost a German Cup game 2-1 to the fourth-tier side Lubeck three days before his departure. \u201cWe sat down together for a long time,\u201d said Anderson. \u201cBut we have found that we are no longer in agreement on our views about the working partnership. That is a real pity, I regret the decision of the club very much, but our ideas were simply too different. We don\u2019t part on angry terms.\u201d Things didn\u2019t really improve for poor old Jorn in his next job. After 16 months out of the game he managed to bag himself the manager\u2019s role at Larissa in Greece just before Christmas 2010. He began with a 1-0 defeat against Olympiakos \u2013 not an awful result against one of the big beasts of the league \u2013 but in the first game following the winter break the team were beaten 3-0 by Atromitos. On their return through Athens the windows of the team bus were smashed and the vehicle pelted with rocks, eggs and yogurt. According to Reuters \u201cplayers and staff were left stranded inside the vehicle for four hours as angry fans set up a blockade by lighting bonfires in front and behind the bus so it could not move\u201d. Five days later (after a third and final defeat of his reign) Anderson was sacked, which must have come as something of a relief, even though he had been in charge for only 24 days. We\u2019ve looked at other hard-done-by managers in the Knowledge before and there does seem to be a Bundesliga theme:  However, surely the hardest-done-by manager in history was the Bayern Munich boss Udo Lattek, also sacked by his paymasters on two occasions. \u201cIn 1975, after he had won three German championships in a row and the European Cup, a Bayern side full of tired World Cup winners only finished 10th in the league,\u201d recalls Raphael Honigstein. \u201cLegend has it he then told club president Wilhelm Neudecker that \u2018things have to change\u2019, only to receive the reply: \u2018Yes, they have to: you\u2019re fired!\u2019 He was reappointed in 1983 and again won three German championships and two cups in four seasons. But the European Cup final defeat in 1987 exposed a fraught relationship with his players. The club ultimately blamed him for the 2-1 loss against Porto and he was sacked. Again.\u201d  CONSECUTIVE DOUBLES \u201cI recently won my 20th consecutive league and cup double on Fifa,\u201d writes Stefan Glosby, who probably needs to change his difficulty level. \u201cIt made me wonder which team hold the record (in real life, obviously) for most consecutive doubles? I\u2019m sure I read about Dinamo Tblisi winning six on the trot in the \u201990s, but has anyone done better?\u201d \u201cDinamo Tblisi\u2019s six in a row from 1992 to 1997 is indeed a European record,\u201d writes Sean DeLoughrey. \u201cUzbekistan\u2019s Pakhtakor Tashkent equalled Dinamo\u2019s record with six doubles in a row from 2002 to 2007. They were AFC Champions League semi-finalists twice during that run. Round these parts Linfield deserve an honourable mention for six doubles in seven seasons in Northern Ireland between 2005-06 and 2011-12.\u201d SEEING RED (OVER AND OVER AGAIN \u2026) \u201cBarnet have had players sent off against them in nine out of our 40 fixtures so far this season,\u201d writes Barnet fan Rafi Cooper. \u201cIs this some kind of record? What\u2019s the most number of games in a season that teams have played against 10 men (or fewer)?\u201d     Who has been benefiting from a profusion of reds? Photograph: Bob Thomas/Getty Images    It\u2019s quite the achievement for the Bees but Portugal\u2019s Cl\u00e1udio Gameiro has the skinny on a side that have benefitted from card-happy referees to an even greater extent: \u201cI can tell you that here in Portugal there\u2019s a team that can beat that. Twice,\u201d he writes. \u201cAlmighty Benfica, who surely don\u2019t need any kind of outside help to win their games, also have the happy knack of causing their opponents to be so clumsy that they get sent off. It has happened 11 times already this season. In 25 league games. If we add up the League Cup games, it will be 14 games out of 29 playing against 10 men. \u201cThe situation is so \u2013 let\u2019s use the word \u2018strange\u2019 \u2013 that even the Spanish newspaper AS wrote about it, although only one Portuguese newspaper thought it worth mentioning. And Porto\u2019s coach, Julen Lopetegui, has also spoken about it. Regarding league games alone it is still far from the 2009-10 season when Benfica played 17 games out 30 league games against 10 men. That\u2019s 56.66 % of the games played against 10 men. But I\u2019ll bet that if you go look at the numbers of Porto\u2019s team during the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s you\u2019ll find some similar \u2018records\u2019 or even worse.\u201d MORE THAN 51 PLAYERS Last week we looked at the teams to have used more than the 51 Blackpool have so far used in the Championship this season. Ian Williams has been in touch with news from South Africa. \u201cBack in the 2003-04 season, Cape Town club Hellenic were in dire straits, with just three points from 16 matches in the SA Premier League. The beleaguered club owners \u2013 their franchise convenience store was under pressure \u2013 put the club up for sale, and the franchise was bought by a club, Premier United, based in the Gauteng, near Johannesburg. \u201cPart of the deal was that the clubs would swap squads \u2013 Premier\u2019s players would play in the PSL under the name Hellenic, and the Hellenic mob would play First Division, under the name Premier United. As a result, 27 (Hellenic) and 31 (Premier) played for the \u2018team\u2019 during the campaign. The PSL side were relegated, and the side in the First Division also got the axe.\u201d KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \u201cIs Verein f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach the longest team name in football?\u201d asked Robert Bashford and Justin Walker in 2005.

There are some who\u2019ll suggest that, with that hideous new crest, it should now (unofficially) be University College Dublin Dublin, National University of Ireland Dublin, Association Football Club (87 letters).

But is it also the outright record in underachievement? Has any other club participated in the CL/European Cup more often in total without ever going on to win it?

What other duos battled it out so often in qualifiers?\u201d \u201cBetween 2009 and 2012 Iceland forward Eidur Gudjohnsen played for Monaco, Tottenham, Stoke, Fulham and AEK Athens but scored only two goals, for an average of 0.4 goals per club,\u201d writes David Taylor. \u201cHas a striker ever had a less impressive record?\u201d \u201cHave any players had careers which saw them progress through and then return to several clubs in palindromic fashion ending where they started?\u201d wonders @Mike65ie on Twitter. \u201cMarouane Fellaini and Adnan Januzaj\u2019s club and national teams have identical nicknames,\u201d notes @FutbolsaCountry on Twitter. \u201cAre they the first?\u201d Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com     A flag of seniority?

The Bangkok junta, which seized power from an elected government last May, plainly hopes to persuade international investors, trading partners and foreign tourists that it is business as usual in Thailand. The reality is very different. Within minutes of Wednesday\u2019s announcement, the regime invoked article 44 of the interim constitution that was arbitrarily imposed last year. Known as the \u201cdictator law\u201d, it gives Prayuth the power to override any branch of government in the name of national security, and absolves him of any legal responsibility. In key respects, the scope for abuse is more threatening than martial law.   \u201cGeneral Prayuth\u2019s activation of constitution section 44 will mark Thailand\u2019s deepening descent into dictatorship,\u201d said Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. \u201cThailand\u2019s friends abroad should not be fooled by this obvious sleight of hand \u2026 that effectively provides unlimited and unaccountable powers.\u201d In particular, unlawful detentions of civilian opponents looked set to increase, he suggested.  The junta had detained hundreds of politicians, activists, journalists and others whom they accuse of supporting the deposed government of prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra, disrespecting the monarchy or backing anti-coup protests, Human Rights Watch said. Military personnel have interrogated many of the detainees in secret military facilities without ensuring safeguards against mistreatment. Yingluck, meanwhile, has been banned from politics and faces criminal prosecution.      The junta has detained hundreds of people accused of supporting deposed prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra, pictured. Photograph: Wasawat Lukharang/NurPhoto/Rex     Prayuth is as much twerp as tyrant. His insistence on the incomparable virtues of \u201cThai-ness\u201d and traditional core values, and his self-proclaimed mission to restore \u201chappiness to the people\u201d, have invited open ridicule, even though the media and institutions are closely controlled. After political gatherings of more than five people were banned last year, university students organised \u201csandwich parties\u201d \u2013 in effect, lunchtime sit-ins. When the idea spread, Prayuth\u2019s military detained the subversive snackers for \u201ceating sandwiches with political intent\u201d.  The former general, who now styles himself prime minister, heads the Orwellian-sounding National Council for Peace and Order. He claims he did not want the job of national overseer, and took it out of a sense of duty. But he is quick to threaten those who question his powers or conduct. Journalists who failed to report \u201cthe truth\u201d could be executed, he warned this month. He was not joking. Like tinpot dictators the world over, Prayuth\u2019s timetable for holding elections keeps slipping. Polls were supposed to be held this year. Now they may happen next year, or later. Meanwhile, the junta, helped by an appointed advisory panel and legislature, is preparing a permanent constitution whose main purpose appears to be to permanently curtail parliamentary democracy and prevent the return of the Shinawatra clan, which has won every poll since 2001.  \u201cThe charter includes provision allowing a non-elected official to assume the role of prime minister in times of crisis. The dangers posed to freedom do not need to be spelled out when autocrats brush aside the fundamental principles of democracy in the name of \u2018national emergency,\u2019 \u2018public order\u2019 and \u2018crisis measures\u2019,\u201d said commentator Aron Shaviv.     General Prayuth Chan-ocha after the army declared martial law in May 2014. Photograph: Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters    \u201cThe charter also suggests the 200-member senate should be nominated, and not subject to any electoral process whatsoever. And to help promote this thoroughly anti-democratic measure, the junta has enlisted the judiciary, sullying the very bedrock of democracy.\u201d The prospect of Prayuth\u2019s dictatorial rule being extended indefinitely is not one that is welcomed in Washington. A public row blew up in January when Daniel Russel, US assistant secretary of state, criticised the lack of democracy. But the Obama administration is conflicted. Thailand is an old and valued ally dating back to the Vietnam war era, which has cooperated on security and military issues, drug interdiction and people trafficking. More to the point, the US does not want to leave the strategic field open to China in its expanding tussle with Beijing for advantage and influence in south-east Asia. Japan shares Washington\u2019s concern. Its prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, recently hosted Prayuth in Tokyo. Abe urged the restoration of civilian rule, but his focus was also on maintaining a strong bilateral business and trade relationship.  China has fewer scruples. \u201cA month after the coup, China assured Bangkok that it would continue to support Thailand\u2019s development and hosted a delegation of senior Thai military officials in Beijing,\u201d said Felix Chang, a Foreign Policy Research Institute analyst. \u201cMore importantly, China won approval for a new railway that will connect Kunming and Bangkok through north-eastern Thailand. Once completed, that railway will tie Thailand\u2019s economy (and interests) more closely to China \u2026 In February, Prayuth agreed to strengthen military ties with China,\u201d Chang said.  The EU also has considerable leverage with Bangkok but, like Washington, has failed so far to exert behaviour-changing pressure. EU foreign ministers condemned the coup last June, suspended some official visits, and promised to keep the situation under review.  Prayuth\u2019s regime badly needs European business and tourism, hence this week\u2019s cosmetic and misleading announcement on martial law. As Bangkok\u2019s third-largest trading partner and second biggest investor, the EU, acting with Washington and Tokyo, must quickly decide whether Thailand\u2019s dismaying slide towards institutionalised dictatorship warrants a tougher stance. The answer is fairly obvious.

We unlock the box, grab the final piece of treasure and dash for the door. I\u2019m at Lock\u2019d, London\u2019s newest room escape game venue, and one of hundreds opening in cities all over the world. For the uninitiated, room escape games are immersive experiences where players are voluntarily locked in a room filled with cryptic puzzles that have to be cracked. They\u2019ll all be on a theme: for example, I\u2019ve just \u201cbroken into a museum\u201d to recover some ancient artefacts. The games first appeared in the late noughties, as puzzlers experimented with creating real-life versions of popular video games, but in the past two years their popularity has snowballed. Now, they are among the most popular attractions on Tripadvisor in cities from LA to Bangkok. A generation brought up on The Crystal Maze has come of age and they really, really want to play.

Now they\u2019re realising it\u2019s more fun to try these games in real life.\u201d Although room escape games have a dedicated following among gamers and are a popular corporate bonding activity (escape the room ... and your boss!), the games have already made their way onto must-do lists in many popular city break destinations. In Budapest, for example, more than 30 room escape games have opened in the past few years, with tourists clamouring to give them a try. New venues continue to open across Europe, in cities such as Prague, Berlin and Amsterdam. Last year saw the first Lisbon venue, when Jo\u00e3o Santos and Anna Mendes opened Lisbon Escape Game in Cais do Sodr\u00e9. Paul Bart is the founder of Escape Hunt, based in Malaysia, which has 21 branches around the world, with a further 55 planned for this year. A psychologist, Bart puts the popularity of the games down to a handful of innate desires: \u201cPeople like to compete, and they like to interact with their environment. Look at the cinema, it started off silent, then they had the talkies, then it went 3D and now there\u2019s 4D. People got bored with the sedentary and want to interact. This interaction is what makes it extremely addictive.\u201d But European and Asian games differ in style, he says. \u201cWith the European style, which has its roots in Hungary, you have your own dedicated room, you\u2019re not mixing with other people and it\u2019s a lot more genteel. In Asia, it\u2019s completely different. Y ou have more blood, screaming and it\u2019s a lot more sensational. There\u2019s one in Bangkok called the Nazi game. You wouldn\u2019t get away with that anywhere else.\u201d Their popularity did get a bit out of hand, he admits. \u201cIf you typed in any city in the world on Tripadvisor, the number one thing to do was an escape game. They\u2019ve had to change their algorithm and put us in a separate sub-category now.\u201d But whether they will ever be viewed with the same regard as a city\u2019s more traditional attractions or not, they seem to provide a welcome alternative to travellers. Danielle Brennan, 26, tried a room escape game for the first time on a visit to Budapest last year and her group enjoyed it so much they tried another one the very next day. \u201cWe just wanted to try something new,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was like Fort Boyard meets Saw and you got a free beer.

According to local media reports, the prime minister, Narendra Modi, who won a landslide victory last year, is keen to hold the Olympics in the emerging Asian power. Thomas Bach, the International Olympic Committee president, will meet Modi later this month in Delhi. The Times of India quoted an \u201cofficial source\u201d confirming that the \u201cgovernment is exploring the possibility of India hosting the Olympics\u201d. However, the source told the newspaper, the prime minister had made it clear that he \u201cdoes not want a repeat of the 2010 Commonwealth Games \u2026 He wanted to know the costs, financial implications and other details.\u201d The Commonwealth Games held in Delhi five years ago led to major corruption scandals. The authorities were criticised when infrastructure projects were not completed in time, athletes complained about their accommodation, and costs soared.  The final costs of the event has never been accurately determined but may have been up to $10bn (\u00a36.7bn), according to some estimates. Many of the world-class facilities that were constructed for the Commonwealth Games now lie virtually unused. \u201cThat was a huge missed opportunity to showcase India to the world. What we remember of it is corruption and mismanagement. We\u2019d have to consider if we can afford the Olympics and what the legacy might be,\u201d said Prof Boria Majumdar, a sports historian. The Indian Olympic Association was also suspended from December 2012 for 14 months for defying the Olympic charter by electing officials facing corruption charges relating to the 2010 event. The ban was only lifted in February last year. Indian athletes had competed for part of the Sochi Winter Games under the IOC flag.  Majumdar said the huge increase in the number of media accreditations issued to Indian journalists for the London Olympics showed how interest in the Olympics had grown in India in recent years. The south Asian nation of 1.3 billion people won six medals at the London event, taking 55th place. The US won 104, China 88 and the UK 65. \u201cThe Olympic movement claims to be a global movement and so has to come to south Asia sooner or later.

But in March 2005, as North Korea\u2019s national team failed to qualify for the next year\u2019s World Cup in a match against Iran, violence erupted at Kim Il-sung stadium in the heart of the city. Iran\u2019s coach at the time was Branko Ivankovi\u0107, a veteran of the Croatian football team NK Vara\u017edin.

For [the players] football is really the whole world \u2013 football gives them a better life.\u201d Thousands rushed the pitch as the match ended, preventing the Iranian team from getting on their bus, and riot police and soldiers had to intervene. \u201cI was scared and nobody knew what was going on,\u201d said Ivankovi\u0107. The team were forced to wait for a few hours in a dressing room for the crowds to be dispersed by the police, he added.  State media reported the game but offered only a hint of what had unfolded: \u201cAt the end of the match all the spectators were angered and vigorously protested the wrong refereeing by the Syrian referee and linesmen,\u201d wrote KCNA, although mentions of the fans\u2019 protests were added to later versions of the piece. The violence was so bad that Fifa ordered North Korea\u2019s last qualifying match \u2013 against its old enemy Japan \u2013 to take place behind closed doors in Bangkok. \u201cI think the North Koreans tried to do something because they were angry. Not just because of the game, they were angry because of the referee, because of the federation, also they were angry at their leader.\u201d \u201cIt was an emotional reaction,\u201d said Ivankovi\u0107.             By contrast, the 1966 World Cup was a major event in North Korea\u2019s sporting history. Not only did the team qualify but they reached the quarter finals, where they defeated Italy 1- 0.  It was a historic moment, documented in the 2002 film The Game of Their Lives. The players returned home as national heroes and, as shown in the film, are still venerated in state propaganda. Football sanctions If anything goes against the idea of North Koreans as mindless automatons, meekly accepting their lot, it\u2019s the 2005 riot in Pyongyang. But what it does reveal about the politics of sport in the country is harder to establish.     It\u2019s \u200bis\u200b often treated more like fishing. I haven\u2019t seen anyone distorted in agony or ecstasy watching a game  Simon Cockerell     There\u2019s a well-established connection between authoritarian regimes and football politics. Under Saddam Hussein, members of the Iraqi football team were imprisoned and tortured for slip-ups on the field, and Qatar\u2019s 2022 successful bid for the World Cup has been marred by allegations of corruption and criticisms of the state\u2019s human rights record.  Communist regimes historically used international sports to showcase their athletic prowess, and North Korea is no exception. Mass games were a fixture of life in the eastern bloc, and the purpose of the Arirang festival in Pyongyang is to demonstrate the nation\u2019s unity and collective spirit through dramatic displays of athletics. In March, as tensions escalated once again on the Korean Peninsula the international football governing body announced it was withdrawing $1.66m in planned financial assistance to the DPRK.

Photograph: /flickr    It was due to be provided through Fifa\u2019s financial assistance program \u2013 which helps countries lacking the means to develop their footballing industry, but Fifa said that money had been withdrawn because of North Korea\u2019s continued nuclear proliferation efforts. \u201cSince Fifa is domiciled in Switzerland, sanctions of the Swiss [authorities] are binding,\u201d a spokesman told Radio Free Asia. \u201cDue to these sanctions, we are currently unable to transfer any money to the North Korea Football Association.\u201d The decision passed with little controversy, but offers further evidence that when it comes to sport, North Korea, like in everything else, is regarded as a pariah. Fishing not football The people of the DPRK are not immune to the pull of international sports, but despite unconfirmed reports in the British tabloid press last year that Kim Jong-un is a fan of Manchester United, North Korean fans do not display the type of devotion seen in the Premier League. The pitch invasion of 2005 seems to be the exception, not the rule. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to whip up the hysteria or mania that other footballing nations have when their teams play,\u201d said Simon Cockerell of Koryo Tours, a keen football fan who has organised matches inside North Korea. \u201cIt\u2019s often treated more like fishing ... I haven\u2019t seen anyone distorted in agony or ecstasy as their team scores or lets in a goal, it just doesn\u2019t seem to bring out the intense emotions that it does elsewhere.\u201d  Korean derbys  Recently, there have also been a number of \u201cKorean derbys\u201d, with the South and North playing against each other. In the qualifying matches for the 2010 World Cup the two Koreas played each other four times, resulting in three draws and one victory for the South.  Two of the games were played in Shanghai because the North refused to allow South Korea\u2019s flag to fly in Pyongyang.   Related: Attitudes changing as North Korea gear up for Asian Cup | John Duerden    Cockrell attended the Shanghai games and described an \u201coverwhelming South Korean fan presence,\u201d and a small but vocal group of supporters for the North Korean team.  Cockrell also insists that the two teams are not \u201carch rivals\u201d as some people might think: \u201cA lot of people in North Korea would like to see South Korea do well \u2013 as fellow Koreans.\u201d  North Korea\u2019s \u2018sports economy\u2019 Football, like everything in North Korea, needs to be understood through the lens of political power. The leadership of the North Korean governing body of football, DPR Korea Football Association, includes head honchos from the military and politics. The president of the association for example, is Ri Jong-mu, who served as sports minister until April 2014, and is a lieutenant general in the Korean People\u2019s Army.  The North Korean state is also in the process of developing its \u201csports economy\u201d \u2013 a massive infrastructure project involving the construction of new stadiums, parks and ski resorts. Curtis Melvin of the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University explains that many of the reasons behind the initiative are unclear, and whilst experts can only speculate, the motivations may centre around increasing loyalty from citizens rather than improving the economy.  \u201cI suspect that it is part of Kim Jong-un\u2019s stated emphasis on improving the lives of the people,\u201d he says. \u201cSports parks, children\u2019s parks, skate parks and water parks are being built all across the country.\u201d ", "publicationDate": "2015-04-04T04:00:05Z", "tags": ["North Korea", "Football", "Asia Pacific", "Sport", "World news", "World Cup", "Football violence", "South Korea", "Sport politics"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/04/football-north-korea-riots-sanctions", "title": "From riots to sanctions: a short history of North Korean football", "sentences": ["The violence was so bad that Fifa ordered North Korea\u2019s last qualifying match \u2013 against its old enemy Japan \u2013 to take place behind closed doors in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "  Related: John Wick review \u2013\u00a0a thrill ride driven by a relentless vengeance machine    Keanu Reeves\u2019s ridiculously entertaining and violent new thriller John Wick marks a return to form for the most taciturn man in modern Hollywood, and also arrests \u2013 albeit only for a moment \u2013 the downward spiral of two recent trends in action cinema. The first is the lately minted old-geezer action movie pioneered by Liam Neeson in his Taken trilogy and the disappointing A Walk Among The Tombstones. They were joined by The Equalizer with Denzel Washington, The Gunman with Sean Penn, the all-star pensioner-reunions Red and Red 2, and The Expendables. This trend got old \u2013 forgive me \u2013 incredibly fast, its formula exhausted by the 20th minute of the worthless Taken 2. Too many third-rate Luc Besson proteges at the helm (Olivier Megaton, I\u2019m looking at you) and too many copycats in Hollywood managed to find the bottom of this genre in no time flat.            John Wick is also a refreshing comeback for the more venerable genre of the east-west hybrid action movie, dating back to Jean-Pierre Melville\u2019s Le Samoura\u00ef and Sidney Pollack\u2019s The Yakuza, if you\u2019ve got a sense of movie history, or to John Woo, Ringo Lam and Quentin Tarantino if you haven\u2019t. White-boy yakuza movies have bled into the mainstream over the last 25 years, giving us such crossover works as Takeshi Kitano\u2019s Brother, The Matrix trilogy, Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s Bangkok-based massacre movie Only God Forgives, all that Besson trash, plus Sin City, The Departed and pretty much anything that features a single member of, or soundtrack by, the Wu-Tang Clan. Reeves practises a Steve McQueen level of reticence in John Wick; I don\u2019t suppose he utters 200 words in the whole film, and he really doesn\u2019t have to: his astronomical body count says it all for him. A retired assassin with a Ford Mustang and a cute dog, he goes to war once he\u2019s deprived of both by the idiot son (Alfie Allen) of gang lord Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist), for whom Wick\u2019s last, pre-retirement bout of mass murder built a massive criminal empire. Even though Tarasov shares Wick\u2019s finely tuned sense of honour and vengeance, his bloodline must survive, and his tooled-up armies of the night are dispatched to take Wick down. So far, so familiar, but there is a sense of reserve lurking among the excess, and each symphony of shots to the head arrives like a new song-and-dance routine in an MGM musical, insanely over-the-top but also governed by superb choreography and an expert sense of spatial dynamics. Reeves\u2019s withholding approach is matched by the film\u2019s succinct 96-minute running time and narrative economy. Add a fabulous cast which includes Ian McShane, David Patrick Kelly and Clarke Peters, and you have an awesome thriller that may not save the genre, but will certainly remind you what it might have been.", "publicationDate": "2015-04-07T08:00:07Z", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Keanu Reeves", "John Wick", "Action and adventure"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/07/keanu-reeves-john-wick", "title": "John Wick: \u2018a symphony of shots to the head\u2019", "sentences": ["White-boy yakuza movies have bled into the mainstream over the last 25 years, giving us such crossover works as Takeshi Kitano\u2019s Brother, The Matrix trilogy, Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s Bangkok-based massacre movie Only God Forgives, all that Besson trash, plus Sin City, The Departed and pretty much anything that features a single member of, or soundtrack by, the Wu-Tang Clan."]}, {"article": "   Credits: OLI/Landsat-8/Nasa    The shipping lanes off the coast of China\u2019s Shandong Peninsula are so crowded that the traffic can be seen from space.

The aroma of wood smoke snakes around dark, railway arched corners, drawing you&nbsp;in to this remarkable sort-of-restaurant and telling fragrant stories of the pleasures in store. \nThese days, I steer clear of pop-ups and supperclubs, reckoning that if they\u2019re good enough, they\u2019ll eventually make it to bricks and mortar. Also, if I want to go to a bad dinner party, I can do that in the comfort of my own home. But Som Saa\u2019s \u201cresidency\u201d at Climpson\u2019s Arch, the enlightened coffee roastery in Hackney, deserves the tossing aside of prejudice. Despite having the appearance of a barbecue in the boondocks \u2013 corrugated iron (real, not in a corporate-designed Dirty Burger way), fairylights, a shipping container pressed into service as a courtyard kitchen, open grills and wood fires \u2013 it is run by consummate professionals. Chef Andy Oliver has worked at Thai guru David Thompson\u2019s Nahm; and Bo.Lan in Bangkok, probably the finest Thai restaurant I\u2019ve eaten in anywhere. Running the FOH with suave good humour is Tom George, who honed his people skills at Goodman and Russell Norman\u2019s Polpo empire. This&nbsp;pedigree, coupled with their palate-startling food, means Som Saa happily transcends its rickety-rackety surroundings. \nJust as well. We wait nearly an hour for a table \u2013 it\u2019s no reservations. Well, of course it is \u2013 and when we finally score one, it\u2019s to be shared with three other couples, all of us Londonishly ignoring each other. We pass the time by ordering all three of the \u201cdrinking snacks\u201d and a bottle of Kung Fu Girl, a Washington riesling that pairs elegantly with a series of kapow-bam flavours: a tangle of jammy-hot chicken piled on fragile tapioca crisps; jan naem \u2013 minced pork fermented with rice and garlic into a bomb of sour meatiness, grilled over smoke and served with shards of ginger, peanuts and cabbage; I can\u2019t tell you how much I&nbsp;love this celestial square sausage; even cashew nuts, laced with tendrils of kaffir lime, lemongrass and toasty, dried chilli, are joyous. \u201cThey\u2019re too buttery,\u201d the pal complains, as if anything in life could be too buttery. \nThe kitchen\u2019s dedication to true northern Thai flavours stops just short of serving grilled rat and ant eggs. Fermentation is done in-house; they make their own coconut cream and offer two types of fiery som tam salad: one Bangkok-style with regular fish sauce, the other Isaan-style with pla ra, a thicker, fermented version that gives the sharp, green papaya a base note of fine, whiffy cheese. \nThe last time I had Thai food this exhilarating was at the Heron in the&nbsp;basement of a sticky-carpeted Paddington boozer, but there I\u2019m not sure they bothered too much about such dreary preoccupations as&nbsp;provenance. (Also, the decor consisted of a spray-on snowman to which someone had added a large, tumescent cock.) At Som Saa, meat comes from the Cornwall Project, a&nbsp;collective that also supplies the stellar likes of Kitchen Table and the Clove Club. And it shows: a slab of rare, chewy bavette steak, deeply beefy and crusted with char, comes with a sweetish nam jim jaew chilli dipping sauce that adds another layer of heat and smokiness. A variation of that sauce, pleasingly gritty with roasted rice powder, accompanies a grilled chicken leg \u2013 a&nbsp;fat, juicy bruiser of a thing. \nSom Saa\u2019s food is a thrill-ride for the senses. Everything is fresher, more vibrant than you\u2019ll find elsewhere, herbs \u2013 Vietnamese mint, coriander, perilla, Thai basil \u2013 greener, bouncier, more fragrant: a bouquet\u2019s worth is scattered over a whole deep-fried seabass, its crunchy skin giving way to pearly flesh, all dotted with more roasted rice and translucent slivers of pink Thai shallot. \nFlavours perform acrobatics on your tastebuds: prawn floss dotting smoky long aubergines; a brooding, Chiang Mai-style pork belly curry, the meat spoonable, the broth humming with almost Indian spicing. It\u2019s nearly too much, a gustatory version of Paradise Syndrome. We&nbsp;recalibrate by making pads of the&nbsp;(excellent) sticky rice and dabbing them through the various dips and sauces, noting that this one&nbsp;is sourer, that one ripe with the funk of fermentation, this one sweeter and punctuated by the fruity sucker-punch of birdseye (aka&nbsp;scud) chillies.

Virgin Active is jointly owned by Virgin Group and buyout firm CVC Capital Partners. CVC is selling the entire 51% holding it acquired in 2011 while Virgin Group, owned by Branson, is offloading 29% for \u00a3230m and will retain a 20% stake in the fitness chain.

Branson founded Virgin Active in 1999. It now has 267 clubs across nine countries with more than 1.3 million members. Its biggest presence is in South Africa where it has 114 outlets, compared with 101 in the UK. It says it is the \u201cclear No1\u201d in the fast-growing South African market, and is also the biggest health club chain by revenue in the UK and Italy, where it has 30 gyms. Virgin said: \u201cWe have held our investment in Virgin Active for 16 years since founding the business with one club in Preston. It is now a leading international player in the health club market and remains a key part of our portfolio of Virgin branded companies. Our investment strategy is to build businesses of scale and this sometimes means accessing external capital to build them further through sales of stakes to partners or through the public markets.\u201d Virgin Active acquired rival chains Esporta and Holmes Place over the last decade. The chain\u2019s management team, led by Paul Woolf, are staying on and will reinvest in the business alongside Brait. The fund also has a minority stake in the UK retailer Iceland.

Fox was fascinated, and thought there was a bigger story to tell. He started tweeting one of Yanny\u2019s pictures every day.     Face in the mirror, 1991, from the archive Found Cambodia. Photograph: Charles Fox    Fox then moved back to Cambodia in 2012, where he has since sifted through thousands of images. \u201cYou have to have that obsessive streak,\u201d he says. Though the memories are difficult to share, people have, more often than not, welcomed him into their homes; and once he explains his project, they start combing through their troves. Fox selects each shot \u201cbased on the strength of the image and the strength of the narrative\u201d, and he only posts physical prints, because that lets him meet individuals and hear their stories. Each image includes a quote from its owner about the image. But he never forces revelations. \u201cThis isn\u2019t me chasing a story,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t have to convince anyone; people have to be willing to share.\u201d While the language barrier can cause problems \u2013 he\u2019s assisted by a translator \u2013 there can still be a catharsis for the people he interviews. \u201cAfter the Khmer Rouge, there\u2019s a lot of joy,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when you start talking about before, it\u2019s a dark time. There is a lot of trauma embedded in these images. When they share their stories, it comes out.\u201d He recalls how one woman he met had created a family portrait with each member\u2019s most recent passport photo. \u201cIt was so mixed up: someone who was young then is now older than [the person] in the photo who had died during the Khmer Rouge.\u201d     Before 1979, from Found Cambodia. This couple made this composite before they travelled to Bangkok for the woman to have cancer treatment. Photograph: Charles Fox    Fox\u2019s investigation reveals not just a scarred country as it heals, but trends in photography. Cambodian photographers are fans of funny and improbable hybrid portraits, in which radically unrelated photos are spliced in the darkroom: a couple are superimposed so they\u2019re standing on a tortoise\u2019s back; a giant face floats above a field of flowers; a man wearing aviator glasses hovers beside Angkor Wat. There are heaps of fanciful studio portraits, and black-and-white images have been hand-painted, bringing lipstick and bouquets blooming to life. People also made special records of their possessions. \u201cThere\u2019s a double portrait where a husband and wife have both had their photo taken with a motorbike, in exactly the same spot,\u201d says Fox. They have gone from having nothing, he explains, \u201cto all of a sudden, having something \u2013 which becomes worth documenting.\u201d The site is arranged by date, but a lot of guesswork is involved in identifying the images. Most poignantly, the time prior to the Khmer Rouge\u2019s reign is simply categorised as \u201cbefore\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s been presented in the press and the history books doesn\u2019t translate into the day-to-day lives of these people,\u201d says Fox. It\u2019s hard to grasp what people went through and witnessed during those years \u2013 forced evacuation, isolation, torture, starvation, exhaustion, execution \u2013 but witnessing the aftermath in pictures and stories is moving, even without grasping all the chilling details of the country\u2019s history. This archive deftly gives a personal face to the Cambodian genocide. The goal, says Fox, is to \u201cgive a gentle insight into people\u2019s day-to-day, and how they\u2019ve rebuilt themselves.

A sea of pilgrims and dignitaries from both nations as well as hosts Turkey, Britain and other countries gathered at Anzac Cove on Friday night and into the dawn hours of Saturday to mark the 100th anniversary of Australian and New Zealand soldiers landing at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915.  The Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, his New Zealand counterpart, John Key, Prince Charles and Prince Harry were among those in attendance. The Australian defence force chief, Mark Binskin, told the thousands gathered of the horror the Anzacs were confronted with on the day they came ashore in Turkey a century ago.

Photograph: Tolga Bozoglu/EPA    \u201cThe quiet stillness of dawn and the gentle sound of the waves on this beach gave way to the flash and roar of gunfire over the painful cries of the wounded,\u201d he said. \u201cFor so many the rising sun that day would be their last.\u201d He told too of the fears that gripped the men as they battled to shore under unrelenting gunfire: a fear they would be cut down, as too many were, but also a fear that they might let their mates down.   Related: Anzac Cove and Gallipoli: then and now \u2013 interactive    \u201cThis is where the Anzac legend was born at great cost,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, so many died and dreams died with them. Here, they lie in sacred soil. Here, we honour their spirit, the spirit of Anzac which lives among us. Here, we will remember them.\u201d Key told the gathering of the challenges the Anzacs faced as they came ashore on that bloody day a century ago. \u201cInstead of the open spaces that have been described to them, they landed here with steep hills rising in front of this narrow beach,\u201d he said. He said the opposing forces who set upon one another with such devastating results had something in common: they believed what they were doing was right and necessary, and both sides conducted themselves with courage and bravery. \u201cThe campaign waged here ensured that the name of this place would be written into the histories of New Zealand, Australia, Britain, Turkey and the many other countries that fought here, never to be erased,\u201d he said.     John Key addresses attendees of the dawn ceremony. Photograph: Osman Orsal/Reuters    He spoke too of the unbreakable bond forged between Australia and New Zealand. \u201cTo us Gallipoli is also a byword for the best character of Australians and New Zealanders, especially when they work side by side in the face of adversity.\u201d Abbott said a century had passed since Australians and New Zealanders splashed out of the sea and into a terrible conflict that ultimately resulted in an enduring gift.     Tony Abbott speaks at Anzac Cove. Photograph: Tolga Bozoglu/AFP/Getty    \u201cIn volunteering to serve they became more than soldiers, they became the founding heroes of modern Australia.\u201d Abbott said every Australian had a duty to the Anzacs. \u201cThey did their duty, now let us do ours. They gave us an example, now let us be worthy of it. They were as good as they could be in their time. Now, let us be as good as we can be in ours.\u201d Prince Charles read the words of Lieutenant Ken Millar, of the 2nd Battalion, who wrote of the grief surviving Anzacs felt as they left their dead mates buried so far from home. \u201cWe lived at Gallipoli with our dead alongside us. Owing to the lack of space our cemeteries were always under our eyes,\u201d the digger wrote.     A small section of the crowd at the the Gallipoli dawn service.

Prince Charles laid a wreath in memory of the dead, followed by Abbott and Key who jointly laid a tribute in acknowledgment of the bond forged at Gallipoli. New Zealand\u2019s defence force chief, Tim Keating, read the Ode of Remembrance, before the Last Post was played followed by a minute\u2019s silence and Reveille. Earlier, ceremonies marking the centenary of the Gallipoli landings and Anzac Day took place across Australia and New Zealand, at Hellfire Pass in Thailand on the route of the notorious second world war Thai-Burma railway built by Japan using war prisoners as slaves, until dawn arrived in Turkey.

In Australia an estimated 120,000 people lined the mall in front of the Australian War Memorial in Canberra for an Anzac Day dawn service that reflected on the \u201cawful cost\u201d of armed conflict.

It had profound, devastating, enduring consequences for all Australians. Fourteen years after federation Australia was thrown out into the international stadium; they wanted to prove themselves,\u201d Keighran said. \u201cOne hundred years on we do think back \u2013 and I do myself \u2013 to the sacrifices, the courage, the tenacity that those original Anzacs had to go through. It\u2019s truly amazing.\u201d The spirit of mateship remained strong in the Australian defence force, Keighran said. Across the Tasman Sea in New Zealand, people turned out in record numbers for Anzac Day services, with an estimated 20,000 flocking to the dawn service at the new Pukeahu National War Memorial in Wellington, the capital. In Auckland a crowd of 34,000 gathered at the War Memorial Museum, easily exceeding the previous record of 20,000, and big numbers were also reported in Dunedin and Christchurch.

The ceremony was also attended by the Australian governor general, Sir Peter Cosgrove, New Zealand\u2019s acting prime minister, Bill English, Turkish ambassador Damla Yesim Say and Victoria Cross recipient Willie Apiata. Cosgrove said: \u201cToday we stand side by side, from this dawn to dusk in New Zealand, Australia, and Turkey.\u201d Later in the day a crowd of approximately 7,000 attended the national commemorative service in the capital before the governors general left to attend an Anzac Day dusk service in Canberra. In London, a poignant dawn service at the Wellington Arch was told the Anzac troops of Gallipoli campaign would never be forgotten. Sir Lockwood Smith, New Zealand\u2019s high commissioner, told the congregation of thousands, including Princess Anne, who had begun gathering well before sunrise: \u201cWe will always remember, be always inspired [by the Anzacs].\u201d     Australin and New Zealand army hats placed on a memorial at the Wellington Arch in London for Anzac Day.

Two others were given late temporary reprieves. Mary Jane Veloso (temporary reprieve) Veloso, aged 30, from the Philippines, was arrested in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, in 2010 and found to be carrying a suitcase packed with 2.2kg (5lb) of heroin. Painted in court as a knowing drugs courier, she was sentenced to death. But her supporters say that poverty had made her susceptible to people traffickers, who promised her a job as a maid in Malaysia but instead made her an unwitting drug mule.  On Tuesday the woman who recruited Veloso for that job, Maria Kristina Sergio, \u201cvoluntarily surrendered\u201d to police in the Philippine province of Nueva Ecija. She was wanted on charges of illegal recruitment and human trafficking. An intervention by the Philippine president, Benigno Aquino raised hopes that his Indonesian counterpart, Joko Widodo, might be sympathetic to her case. However, the attorney general said the execution would go ahead. Veloso has two sons, aged 12 and six. Her sister, Marites Veloso-Laurente, said their mother had had to explain to them \u201cIf Mumma does not go home, just think Mumma is in heaven.\u201d           Indonesia\u2019s execution of eight drug offenders on Wednesday has drawn international condemnation \u2013 video report    Andrew Chan Chan was arrested in Denpasar in April 2005, on a flight bound for Australia. A 22-year-old still living with his parents in western Sydney, he was carrying no drugs, but was found guilty, along with Myuran Sukumaran, of masterminding a drug smuggling ring and recruiting seven other Australians \u2013 the so-called Bali Nine. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by firing squad. In his time on Indonesia\u2019s death row, those who have been in contact with him say he is an utterly changed man. Now 31, he has become a committed Christian and a pastor, and spends much of his day in prayer or religious study, and counselling other prisoners. On the eve of his execution Chan married his Indonesian girlfriend, Febyanti Herewila, in a ceremony on Nusa Kambangan, the prison island where he awaits the firing squad. His brother, Michael Chan, described leaving him after a final visit on Tuesday as \u201ctorture\u201d. Myuran Sukumaran Arrested with Chan in 2005, Sukumaran, then 24, had also been living with his parents in Sydney, working in a mailroom. In his time in prison, he has become an accomplished artist, and his final painting \u2013 a heart dripping with blood, signed by all nine condemned prisoners \u2013 was removed from Nusa Kambangan by Indonesian officials on Tuesday. Chinthu Sukumaran, brother of Myuran, who spoke of behalf of his family after returning from Nusa Kambanang for what is expected to be the final time, said: \u201cWe did talk about the death penalty and he knows this is just a waste. He knows this is not going to solve anything with drugs. \u201cDrug trafficking will still be there. If these nine people die today, tomorrow, next week, next month, it is still not going to stop anything. I ask the president to please show mercy.

Photograph: Roni Bintang/AAPIMAGE    Rodrigo Gularte Rodrigo Gularte, who has twice been diagnosed with schizophrenia, is set to be the second Brazilian to be shot by firing squad in Indonesia this year. The Brazilian foreign ministry has declared the death sentence \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201ccontrary to the common sense and basic standards of human rights protection\u201d in a letter sent on Monday to the government in Jakarta. Gularte, who is from a wealthy family in the state of Paran\u00e1 , was arrested at Jakarta airport in 2004 with 6kgs of cocaine secreted in a surfboard. His lawyers have argued unsuccessfully that his history of mental illness made him unfit to stand trial. Gularte was first diagnosed with a mental illness in 1982, according to medical documents obtained by his legal team. Last year, doctors confirmed the schizophrenia diagnosis. Indonesia\u2019s attorney general ordered a second opinion from police doctors, but this has not been made public, prompting criticism of the lack of transparency. His cousin Angelita Muxfeldt , who is in Indonesia, said Gularte has asked to be buried in Brazil. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for three months and never seen Rodrigo so calm,\u201d she told the domestic media. Martin Anderson Anderson was sentenced to death in 2004 after being found guilty of possessing about 50g (1.8oz) of heroin. The 50-year-old travelled to Indonesia on a false passport and was thought to be Ghanian, but is in fact \u2013 like three of his fellow prisoners \u2013 from Nigeria. He was reportedly shot in the leg during his arrest. His lawyer told the media that he has been in poor spirits since being moved to Nusa Kambangan to face execution. Raheem Agbaje Salami (also known as Jamiu Owolabi Abashin) Abashin, 50, has said he was homeless in Bangkok when a new \u201cfriend\u201d offered him $400 to take some clothes to Indonesia. He was arrested in Surabaya with 5.5kg (12lb) of heroin and originally sentenced, in 1999, to life in prison. The sentence was changed to one of death in 2006. In an appeal for presidential clemency, Abashin admitted he had known he was carrying the drugs. His appeal was unsuccessful. Silvester Obiekwe Nwolise Nwolise, 47, was convicted in 2002 of smuggling just over a kilogram of heroin into Indonesia. He was sentenced to death. His wife said he believed he was carrying tablets \u2013 which he swallowed \u2013 containing goat horn powder for some Nigerian friends in Pakistan. She also said he had no translator during his trial, and there are allegations that a bribe was sought to spare him a death sentence. Okwuduli Oyatanze Oyatanze, 41, was sentenced to death in 2002, found guilty of attempting to bring 2.5kg of heroin through Jakarta in capsules inside his stomach. Charles Burrows, a Catholic priest who has counselled Oyatanze in prison, says that the Nigerian man, following the collapse of his clothing company, had thought being a drugs mule would be \u201ceasy money\u201d. Zainal Abidin Abidin, 50, an Indonesian, was moved to Nusa Kambangan in preparation for execution despite still having an appeal due to be heard by the courts. He was convicted in 2001 of being the ringleader of a plan to sell marijuana, which he denies. Two men convicted with Abidin, who he claims were the real masterminds of the ring, have served prison sentences and are now free. Serge Atlaoui (temporary reprieve) Atlaioui, from France, was due to be executed this week, but it has been delayed pending a legal challenge. He was arrested for working in a factory used to produce ecstasy. He claims he was working as a welder and was unaware of the illegal activity.

Denis Sassou Nguesso held out a long flaming torch to set ablaze the tusks, fuelled by captured illegal timber, then stepped back quickly from the sudden rush of heat. Accompanied by Idriss D\u00e9by, the president of Chad, he stood and applauded amid a throng of officials and camera crew. Organisers of the illegal wildlife trade conference in the capital, Brazzaville, hope the ceremony will send a clear message. \u201cSymbolism matters in these things,\u201d said Anthony Kwaku Ohemeng-Boamah, country representative of the UN Development Programme. \u201cIt shows this is something the world community abhors. Burning is how most Asian societies dispose of dead bodies. We are disposing of the elephants that have been poached and we wish they were alive.\u201d     Thai customs officials display seized ivory in Bangkok. Photograph: Xinhua/Corbis    The trade has earned comparisons with drugs, arms and human trafficking as a global crime worth an estimated $23bn (\u00a315bn) a year. Poachers in Africa are using cyanide, night-vision goggles and AK-47 rifles to keep up with demand in Thailand and China, where one elephant\u2019s ivory can fetch $18,000. About 20,000 elephants were killed in 2013. Ohemeng-Boamah said: \u201cA conference of this nature, where all Africa comes together, is very important because animals know no boundaries. It\u2019s like air pollution: when the wind blows, you don\u2019t know where it will take you. There is an awareness in Africa that we need to do something. If we do not have equal strength jurisdictions, no one can say, \u2018I\u2019m saving elephants\u2019.\u201d D\u00e9by told the summit that whereas Chad boasted 50,000 elephants half a century ago, its current population was just 1,500. \u201cPoaching has gone beyond national borders and is part of an international mafia trade,\u201d he said. \u201cChad is completely committed to the fight against the scourge, not only in Africa but at the international level and the world.\u201d     D\u00e9by sets alight tusks during a ceremony at Zakouma national park last year. Photograph: AFP/Getty    Celebrities including Prince William, David Beckham, a footballer, and Jackie Chan, an actor, have been involved in campaigns to raise public awareness. But while the international community has been ringing alarm bells, Africa has been accused of complacency and taking its abundance of natural wonders for granted. Some of its 54 countries are said to be dragging their feet in dealing with the complex transnational trade despite pressure from the UK, organiser of a big conference in London last year, and other global partners. The African Union-backed conference in Brazzaville is pursuing an action plan that will dismantle mafia networks and show the continent speaking with one voice. Philip Muruthi, senior director of conservation science at the African Wildlife Foundation, said: \u201cAfricans have to be angrier. You cannot make change if you have the status quo: \u2018Elephants are dying, so what?\u2019 Other people are saying there\u2019s a crisis but we have to care. A lot of Africans think there is a lot of wildlife. Why? They\u2019ve seen it at some point in their lives. An elephant goes into your garden and you think there are lots of elephants.\u201d Quick and concerted action is vital, he said. \u201cIn the area of corruption, kingpins not being prosecuted, we need to escalate the level of seriousness. That\u2019s where collaborations are very important. Everybody says this is a serious crime like money laundering, governments are saying that, so what action is being taken? We should be seeing more people arrested, convicted and given deterrent punishments, but we are not.\u201d     One of the dwindling population of African giraffe, in Kour\u00e9, Niger. Photograph: Godong/Robert Harding World Imagery/Getty Images    Certain subspecies in Africa are near breaking point, Muruthi noted. The west African giraffe, found in Niger, is down to fewer than 500, and all types of the species are in decline. Fewer than 7,000 wild dogs remain, while the population of Gr\u00e9vy\u2019s zebra is below 3,000. There are only five northern white rhino left on the planet. \u201cUnfortunately the number of species moving to vulnerable and endangered to critically endangered is on the increase. The rapid level of killing not only endangers the species but also several roles it plays in the ecosystem.\u201d     Game rangers free a female eland antelope from an illegal snare at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. Photograph: Tony Karumba/AFP/Getty Images    Loss of elephants, for example, also damages trees whose seeds must pass through an elephant\u2019s gut for germination, while a decline in predators such as lions has a \u201ccascade effect\u201d that can lead to overpopulation and overgrazing. The wildlife trafficking crisis is combined with a crisis of habitat loss, he added, as well as eroding livelihoods for millions of people in Africa. Muruthi said: \u201cI\u2019m hoping for an action plan from this conference. It will be a folly if we just end up with a list of recommendations. These meetings are useful in that they keep awareness up but they can\u2019t only do that.\u201d Some African states have been criticised for a lack of political will. The Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, South Africa and Tanzania are among those being urged to invest more resources, hire more park rangers and toughen legislation and sentences. Congo-Brazzaville follows Kenya and Ethiopia which last month incinerated stockpiles of ivory to show their opposition to the trade. Henri Djambo, Congo-Brazzaville\u2019s forest economy and sustainable development minister, said: \u201cThe main message is that you have to destroy the objects of shame.\u201d Poaching reduced the number of elephants here to 10,000 in the 1980s, but it has since recovered to 40,000, Djambo said, though strains on natural habitat mean the animals encroach on villages. \u201cOur population has gained some ecological awareness that they\u2019re not supposed to be killing the animals. But poaching is carried out by those with no sense of civil responsibility for personal gain.\u201d     A Kenyan wildlife official watches as a 15-tonne pile of ivory burns.

Djambo, 63, is also a novelist and playwright whose works often contain an ecological message. One of his plays, about children taking on the roles of game ranger, customs official and police officer to combat wildlife crime, was staged at the conference. \u201cI start from the observation that people don\u2019t read very much in this country. This is a country of oral traditions so I think this is the best way of communicating with the people. \u201cAfrican political will and determination are key for the continent to be able to realise this massive undertaking. Everybody who\u2019s concerned with an issue has to run in your direction when you\u2019re calling them. Anybody [who] turns their back on the burning edifice of African biodiversity is someone who refuses to participate in extinguishing the fire.\u201d A document and a draft action plan from the conference will be taken to an African Union summit to be held in South Africa in June.

The restaurant has been open about a month now, and the queue never dwindles. At any hour, a few hundred of the city\u2019s hungry and curious can be counted on to patiently wait.  When I went, the line seemed to loom from three blocks away. A friend I\u2019d invited along arrived a few moments before me, and by the time I joined him a half-dozen stragglers were already snaking behind. By the time we actually moved forward a step, the line seemed to have doubled.  The crowd was an affable mix of teenaged tourists and local office workers enjoying an extended lunch hour \u2013 the only sort of people, I suppose, able to squander 90 minutes on a Tuesday afternoon. People busied themselves on their phones \u2013 the Tetsu queue is a popular subject of Instagram photography \u2013 or shared rumors about how long friends and colleagues had waited for their cheesecakes on afternoons prior. A pair of computer programmers behind me speculated that in another month or two the novelty of the cheesecake would be exhausted. A lot of people mentioned the cronut. Every few minutes someone passing by would stop to ask what everybody was lining up for. One of us would sheepishly mutter something about Japan. The bold among us steeled themselves preemptively against the judgment of passersby. But I suspect most of us simply believed that we were there for more than just dessert: we were there for an event, something grand and communal.  My friend and I at last stepped into the Tetsu storefront. On the wall, greeting the lucky survivors, was a large cartoon modeled on Tetsu, beaming joyously. \u201cI like excitement very much!\u201d reads a speech bubble beside him. \u201cI\u2019m of medium height and a little fat, always wearing a jersey with flip-flops.\u201d Suddenly, a medium-sized fat man in a jersey and flip-flops shuffled into the restaurant \u2013 a remarkable likeness. \u201cIt\u2019s Uncle Tetsu!\u201d a little girl screamed. In short order, I received my prize: a six-inch cheesecake so fresh it was practically luminescent, stamped with the likeness of the Tetsu cartoon.  Have you ever eaten a slightly undercooked piece of french toast? That\u2019s what Japanese cheesecake tastes like, not unpleasantly. It\u2019s like a sweet, soggy quiche. I would eat another, I think, though perhaps not until the fervor winds down a little.  The question of whether something like this was worth the wait strikes me as beside the point. An hour and a half in line has a funny way of conferring upon anything an aura of significance \u2013 and an expectation that, if it can\u2019t be fulfilled by what you\u2019ve waited for, it is by the very act of having waited.

Novotel in Blackfriars has been given an \u201cexcellent\u201d rating for its environmental performance and is trying to change the mindset of guests so that sustainability becomes something they actively seek out when choosing a hotel.  The Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) rating ranks the hotel among the top 10% of UK new non-domestic buildings. Novotel is one of the Accor Group\u2019s mid-scale hotel chains, among other international brands such as Sofitel, Mercure and Ibis.  The Novotel group is market leader in Europe and worldwide has more than 3,700 hotels in 92 countries \u2013 it has a total of 480,000 rooms. It is committed to reducing the environmental impact of hotels through its Planet 21 initiative and the new Blackfriars hotel, based in a busy tourist area of London, is a showcase. Planet 21 has seven themes: health, nature, carbon, innovation, local, employment and dialogue. These cover a comprehensive list of sustainability goals ranging from ensuring interiors are healthy, reducing water use and encouraging eco-design, to protecting children from abuse, buying responsibly, conducting business openly and improving the quality of life at work.  Half the savings in laundry costs raised by encouraging guests to reuse towels go to reforestation projects. The group has planted more than 2,000 trees a day since 2009. In 2013, Accor Morocco joined forces with Pur Projet to plant 2,000 olive trees with \u201cFemmes du Rif\u201d, a collective in Chefchaouen, Morocco. Now it uses olive oil produced from the trees in local hotels. Three Pullman hotels installed beehives on roofs in 2011 and produce honey that guests eat at breakfast. In Bangkok, the Siam Square Novotel produces spirulina, a micro-organism particularly rich in protein and amino acids. Almost 90% of hotels have excluded endangered seafood from their menus and 95% use ecological products. The group has set a high standard for sustainable hospitality and has awards to applaud hotels\u2019 performance. Four levels (bronze, silver, gold and platinum) encourage hoteliers to bring in sustainability measures.  The Blackfriars hotel has a platinum rating. All platinum and gold ratings are on the Accor website, helping guests identify hotels that have a range of external certifications, including BREEAM. BREEAM, the world\u2019s foremost environmental assessment method and rating system for buildings, judged Novotel London Blackfriars \u201cexcellent\u201d with a post-construction score of 72.17%.  A combined heating power system) is installed in the building, extracting thermal heat from the exhaust ventilation and using the energy to generate electricity and heat water.  Other initiatives include low energy lamps for permanent lighting and in bedrooms, energy-efficient refrigerators in bedrooms, energy-efficient boilers and recovered energy from ventilation. Recycling is extensive and includes electrical and electronic equipment and cooking oil.  Taps and showers are fitted with water flow regulators, toilets are water-efficient and use rainwater from the roof and guests are encouraged to reuse towels and sheets if they are staying longer than a night. The group buys ecological paper, eco-label and organic products.  Accor has introduced an e-learning course in eight languages to train its 16,000-plus employees and improve the environmental and societal performance level of other hotels in the group.

Kasparov\u2019s 10-game rapid/blitz match with Nigel Short was intended as an extra to the announcement of a new $1m Grand Tour in which the London Chess Classic at Olympia this December will be the finale. Kasparov began with a draw from a winning position, lost game three on time through misjudging his clock but then simply took off. He won seven games straight to take the match 8.5-1.5, banging out his rich combinative play so fast that the computer commentaries had difficulty in keeping up before confirming that his tactics were sound and correct. The match was unrated and Kasparov has no official Fide rapid or blitz rating but, if he turned up at the next world rapid/blitz championship, he would be a prime contender even if Magnus Carlsen defended his titles. The pair did have blitz sessions together during the brief and unhappy period in 2010 when Kasparov coached the Norwegian and Carlsen reported afterwards that the games were close: \u201cNeither of us likes losing, especially him.\u201d Short will be 50 next month but he is still active and strong, the oldest in the world\u2019s top 100. He will be the favourite to capture the world senior title in Italy in November. The Englishman, who challenged for Kasparov\u2019s world title in 1993, fought and counterattacked hard, acted as a fine foil for Kasparov\u2019s magic and had the disadvantage of jet lag, flying direct from Bangkok after winning the Thailand Open. The Grand Tour, which is clearly intended as a Western rival to Fide\u2019s Grand Prix series where almost all the venues are in the old Soviet Union, will comprise the Stavanger, St Louis (Sinquefield Cup) and London Classic tournaments, with an Indonesian event planned as an extra for 2016. Each tournament will include nine grandmasters from the world elite, led by Carlsen, plus a wild card from the host venue. Quite likely some of the top GMs will regard the Grand Tour and the Grand Prix as a bonus and play in both, as happened in the mid-1990s when there were two world champions and two candidates qualifiers. Such rivalries are basically unstable and Fide, whose Grand Prix already has budget and venue cuts from its previous version, will be under pressure. Kasparov in his pomp rarely played Richter Sicilians, so this an interesting opening. Short\u2019s attack with 9 h4, 11 f4 and 14 e5 was too sharp, but its refutation only became clear with 16...Bxe5! and 21...Rd8. White then has no good way to defend his d1 knight since if 22 Kc1?

This time around, neither the BBC\u2019s rolling news channel nor Sky News has broken through in the same way. That\u2019s possibly because the 2015 campaign has itself been so very dull \u2013 but it\u2019s also a vivid reminder of the news channels\u2019 struggle for attention in a world of Twitter, Buzzfeed and Periscope. As a result, journalists on both TV news channels are dogged by disruptive digital-driven reorganisations. Their management teams, bewitched by iPad apps, speak of \u201call platforms being equal\u201d, and of the danger in treating news channels as \u201csome separate legacy product, like Windows 95\u201d. What that means on the ground at Sky is that all executive producers and the entire planning team \u2013 around 30 editorial staff in total \u2013 have been forced to reapply for a smaller number of jobs. One of them is the executive producer Nick Phipps who, ironically, is in charge of Sky\u2019s crucial election night coverage. One Sky journalist says \u201cit\u2019s a huge reorganisation, low morale, bad HR management \u2013 but good strategically\u201d, and that many Sky stories get more views on Facebook than on the TV channel. Sky management, by the way, firmly denies rumours that Sky News\u2019 budget or headcount is being cut overall \u2013 whether to pay for Stuart Murphy\u2019s well-funded Sky entertainment channels, or the breathtakingly costly new Premier League deal. It\u2019s a different story at the BBC, where digital ambition is most definitely tempered by cuts. Numerous production jobs will soon go as part of the \u201cDelivering Quality First\u201d cuts programme, as well as four on-screen presenter roles. The channel\u2019s rolling-news hours are diminishing fast, eaten up by Victoria Derbyshire\u2019s unpopular new mid-morning show, dreary repeats of The Travel Show and Click on Sundays, and \u2013 as from June \u2013 even a simulcast of BBC World News\u2019s Outside Source in the plum 9pm slot. \u201cNot so much BBC News 24,\u201d says one corporation wag, \u201cas BBC News 11am-to-6pm-on-weekdays\u201d. It is the march of BBC World News \u2013 the corporation\u2019s commercially funded English-language TV news station, which airs on cable and satellite around the world outside the UK \u2013 that domestic News channel staffers perhaps fear the most. So far, the \u201cBob Crow factor\u201d has saved the UK channel from merger with its international counterpart (the trade unionist\u2019s death was a huge story in Britain, not so much in Bangkok), but insiders fear that it is only a matter of time. And, while the internationalisation of the BBC News channel or the digital fragmentation of Sky News might be inevitable, they could potentially leave big gaps in British TV\u2019s capacity to report rolling news \u2013 not least during election campaigns. Privately, a BBC management source insists there is a \u201cstrong commitment\u201d to the domestic News channel, speaking of a digital \u201cworld of \u2018and\u2019\u201d, in which the News channel\u2019s output complements (and is reused by) the BBC\u2019s online services. Yet even when pressed, that source will not predict an independent future for the BBC News channel by 2020. By the time of that next general election, the breakout stardom of not only Kuenssberg but the entire BBC News channel could be gone. \u201cI just don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be here,\u201d says one of the channel\u2019s journalists. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be here at all.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2015-05-03T17:05:01Z", "tags": ["TV news", "BBC", "BBC Worldwide", "Television industry", "Sky News", "Media", "Sky plc", "General election 2015", "Politics", "Twitter", "Internet", "Blogging", "Technology", "BuzzFeed", "Digital media", "UK news", "Social media"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/may/03/election-coverage-twitter-buzzfeed-periscope-bbc-sky-news", "title": "Rolling TV election news eclipsed by Twitter, Buzzfeed and Periscope", "sentences": ["So far, the \u201cBob Crow factor\u201d has saved the UK channel from merger with its international counterpart (the trade unionist\u2019s death was a huge story in Britain, not so much in Bangkok), but insiders fear that it is only a matter of time."]}, {"article": "For more than two decades Moe Moe Lwin watched helplessly as Rangoon, her home city, transformed beyond recognition.  Pavements vanished and the streets became clogged with cars. Beloved cinemas fell to bulldozers and green spaces slowly disappeared.\u201cWe had walked, played and worked all around these beautiful areas, and they had become totally normal, just a part of daily life,\u201d remembers Lwin. \u201cIt\u2019s only really when you start seeing these changes [that] you begin to appreciate what you had and what you have \u2026 we have a long history of architecture in Burma and a lot of history attached to these streets and buildings.\u201d With Victorian and Edwardian buildings still punctuating much of downtown Rangoon, the city serves up a dizzying array of buildings; a decaying reminder of Burma\u2019s unique history of colonial occupation followed by decades of socialist isolationism. Many are more than a century old, their age written in the fading colours, filigrees of damp, and decades of creeping mould that envelop most exteriors. Some maintain the glorious porticos that provide shelter from the rain and sun, but most were destroyed when the streets were first widened in the 1990s. Between 1990 and 2011, an estimated 35% of downtown Rangoon was destroyed to make way for new development projects: shopping mall and overpriced condominiums and hotels. The city as Lwin knew it was at risk, so in 2012 she and a number of like-minded conservationists came together to form the Yangon Heritage Trust, which she now directs.

With the theme \u201cMy Yangon My Home\u201d, the festival gave Rangoon locals the opportunity to visualise their city\u2019s future by looking closer at their history and heritage. \u201cWe wanted to show a different side to [the city]. We used public spaces, old heritage sites for the events, so everyone can see,\u201d says Htein Lin, a Burmese artist and activist who co-curated the festival. And considering the rapid changes the city has already undergone, Lin also notes the timely nature of the inaugural festival. \u201cWith all this construction and demolition of buildings and public spaces, [this] is such a good time to be sharing information about these things \u2013 to let people know what they were and what they can be.\u201d In a small alley dwarfed by the bright red brick of Rangoon\u2019s supreme court, a steady stream of hungry punters order breakfast at a simple street-food stall.

The gross disparity between western e-waste (25kg per capita annually) and African (1.7kg) is just one of the many heads of the Hydra driving the vast and tragic displacement of human beings. Our profligacy not only pillages, with concomitant pollution, the resources of less privileged countries, but outsources manufacture to places where substandard if not slave wages are paid to non-unionised labour. How much of last year\u2019s 41.8m tonnes of e-waste is being lucratively traded by criminal gangs and dumped back on the doorsteps of the poor? While westerners install private pools and multiple en suite toilets, the World Health Organisation estimates that 1 billion people don\u2019t have access to clean drinking water, and a third of humankind lacks basic sanitation, causing 3.5 million deaths annually. The average Bangladeshi has an ecological footprint of 0.5 hectares; the average Australian requires nine hectares. This isn\u2019t simply unjust, it\u2019s both obscene and ecocidal. There are no piecemeal answers. The only solution I can see is a radical overhaul of an economic system accountable to neither morality nor social and ecological justice, and whose highest earners truck in weapons, illegal drugs, pornography and people trafficking. Can anything change until we begin to accept our complicity in the desperation at our gates?Annie MarchWest Hobart, Tasmania, Australia It may already be too late Larry Elliott\u2019s sobering review (24\u00a0April) outlines what needs to be done to keep global CO2 emissions below the feared scenario: runaway climate change and civilisation-destroying levels. By 2035, near doubling natural gas\u2019s share in power generation, carbon capture on existing coal plants, expanding renewables fourfold, doubling nuclear power etc \u2013 in short, everything conceivable. He details a number of other essential measures: eliminating subsidies to the oil industry, placing a price on carbon, subsiding the developing world\u2019s transition to a carbon-free economy. Time is short. With the accelerating release of methane from melting Arctic permafrost and ocean sediments, it may already be too late. What then is preventing humanity from embarking on the required transformations, which would generate a massive stimulus in the global economy? While rejecting capitalism, Naomi Klein\u2019s villain, Elliott fails to provide an adequate explanation. That we all consume hydrocarbon fuels poses the question of who stands to lose by its elimination. Only the fossil-fuel industry suffers in the move to alternate energy sources. We will only Keep It In The Ground if we break the domination this industry exerts over our governments.Brian OstrowGuelph, Ontario, Canada \u2022 Congratulations on publishing the splendid article by Larry Elliott on the global economy and fossil fuels. The argument he makes about energy prospects in the \u201cdeveloping world\u201d and the need for \u201cthe rest of the world\u201d to help them in developing renewable energy is important. Perhaps a solution will also emerge when the distinction between profit and growth is clarified. Much of the waste of both energy and materials in rich countries results from the unceasing drive to produce and sell varieties of the same goods that differ from one another only in superficial ways. Durability conflicts with sales, and patent laws protect profit at the cost of developments that could be of real benefit to the consumer. On top of it all is the huge advertising effort, which consumes energy and materials without really helping people to make informed choices. Here again Elliott opens the way to further discussion when he writes: \u201cIt is extremely simplistic to be pro-growth or anti-growth. What matters is what sort of growth.\u201dRF PriceEaglemont, Victoria, Australia \u2022 It\u2019s a shame that in quoting Professor Dieter Helm in his article on surviving without fossil fuels that Larry Elliott didn\u2019t find a more sensible statement from a man who must know better. To suggest that those questioning growth want to abandon technology, as Helm says, is untrue and unhelpful. It confuses growth with progress. No country can sustain a culture of endless growth in the throughput of materials, the associated waste stream, and the consumption of energy to drive the whole process. That is the type of mindless growth we should question. By all means let\u2019s continue to improve technology, educate more people better, and increase the value of the goods and services we produce \u2013 and count that as growth. Well done GW for finally tackling the issue of fossil fuel and growth. There is an extensive literature out there on this, so hopefully there\u2019ll be more GW articles. Here in Australia there is no recognition on the part of the Murdoch press, the Liberal government or the Labour opposition that the goal of endless growth is even an issue, let alone a selfish and dangerous folly.Peter MartinPort Willunga, South Australia \u2022 I am a fan of Larry Elliott on economics, but less so when he moves into social sciences. Regarding Cuba, he asserts that every possible scrap of land is exploited for food production. This may be so within the town environments, though likely for ideological reasons, but I would say that fully 50% of the agricultural land is not used in the countryside. I have always wondered if that was because of poor soil quality or inefficiency. It is perhaps the one area where opening up to trade with the US would help.Stephen BanksBirmingham, UK Beware of techno-fixes I read your article about carbon capture and storage (17 April) and one thing mentioned by Naomi Klein in her book This Changes Everything came to mind: Wolf talks about the fact that CO2 is a desired \u201cpropellant\u201d that can be pumped into old oil wells in order to extract even more oil. Indeed, there could be a ready market for that captured carbon. And it would also be interesting to know the true \u201cenergy costs\u201d of CCS? Could it not be the case that, by the time you have captured, transported and stored that carbon, the net energy gain from the power produced is either dramatically reduced or even negative? I am highly sceptical about techno-fixes such as CCS and feel that, if we are not careful, we could end up with a situation where CCS does more harm than good by sapping power from energy production. The carbon extracted might even be used to turn old oilfields into bubbling fountains of black gold, the burning of which releases even more carbon into the atmosphere. My solution? We should all use dramatically less electricity. Or are our gadgets, our gizmos and our air-conditioned comfort more important than the planet?Alan MitchamCologne, Germany It is wrong to snub Putin I admit I am a Putinversteher (Putin understander, as Timothy Garton Ash says), born and partially raised in the former GDR by parents also born and raised in that state with grandparents who were displaced by the second world war. For me it is a shame that the western leaders are not represented in Moscow at the celebration for the Soviet victory, 9 May (West snubs Russia\u2019s victory rally, 24 April). Or at least, like Angela Merkel, make a compromise and somehow appreciate the Russian/Soviet contribution at that big tragedy unfolding 70 years ago. Not the dubbed D-Day was the turning point of the war; the breakthrough of the red army at Heeresgruppe Mitte was. Since 20 to 25 million Soviet citizens died during the four years of war, it is a disgrace to all of them not to attend any commemoration whatsoever.Steffen M\u00fcllerSch\u00f6nberg, Germany True democracy is very rare I sometimes become a little exasperated by some of the west\u2019s views on democracy, like those of Simon Tisdall in his article West must pressure Thailand (10 April). There is more to democracy than elections, and the present Thai government has done more and brought more peace to Thailand than either of the previous two governments. There will be elections eventually but not before the two opposing sides can accept the result and not riot against the winning side, causing more disruption and unhappiness. It should be said that in regard to the current election in the UK, so few people actually vote that whoever the winner is can hardly be said to represent the majority of the population. In the US, Congress does not represent the people, but represents interests. Business and other lobby groups who have provided the cash for the candidates to fight their obscenely expensive elections want something in return. So neither meets the description of a true democracy. It should be remembered that the most successful country in Asia \u2013 Singapore \u2013 can hardly said to be truly democratic, and yet is much favoured by the west.Geof AllenbyBangkok, Thailand Briefly \u2022 Help!

The claim comes after Thai authorities uncovered two graves apparently containing the remains of Rohingya \u201cboat people\u201d brought to remote parts of the country from Burma by transnational criminal syndicates. The discovery of 26 corpses at a mass burial site in Songkhla province on 1 May was followed days later by the finding of two skeletons in a second southern province, Phang Nga. More corpses have since been found close to the original site. But interviews with survivors, brokers and police officials, carried out by the NGO Fortify Rights for a report on Rohingya trafficking, suggest these grim finds may only scratch the surface of a much larger problem in which the Thai government is allegedly complicit.  Survivors spoke of regular killings at camps, common graves and torture at the hands of gang members trying to extort money from their families. The Rohingya, a long-persecuted ethnic minority, have been leaving Burma in large numbers since an outbreak of violence in 2012 left neighbourhoods razed and claimed hundreds of lives. More than 100,000 people fled Rakhine state. Many of those who escaped fell into the hands of trafficking gangs that operate within the Bay of Bengal. Stripped of citizenship by Burma\u2019s military government in 1982, the Rohingya have been subject to strict controls governing their freedom of movement, education and right to work. About 140,000 Rohingya now reside in squalid camps for internally displaced people, unable to leave and policed by local security forces that have been accused of a range of abuses. The interviews carried out by Fortify Rights highlight a life of similar misery beyond Burma. One survivorspoke of hundreds of deaths which she alleges occurred during a two-month spell in a large camp in an unidentified mountainous area near the Thai border with Malaysia.  \u201cWe saw many people die,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they died, they put them in a common grave \u2026 Sometimes five and sometimes six died at a time. \u201cThere were almost 2,000 people there.\u201d In another statement, a 17-year-old Rohingya man who said he was held at a site on the Thai coast, close to the border with Malaysia, said he knew of seven people who died in the camp.  \u201cTwo people died just beside me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had pain in their chests and then died. We washed the dead bodies, and after that we wrapped on the bodies a little bit of white cloth that we could find and then buried the bodies, two in the same grave. It was difficult to dig because there were rocks. So we just dug a little bit and covered the bodies.\u201d  He was unable to identify the location of this grave, as he had been blindfolded when brought to the camp. At another site, a Rohingya woman described a mountain location containing three camps, two of which had been abandoned. She described the brutal techniques deployed by traffickers against their human cargo, intended to induce panic and fear among the victim\u2019s relatives so that they would pay large sums for their release. \u201cWe called our relatives and they would beat us and tell us to ask for money. They had pliers and pulled on our ears and breasts. They pulled on the men\u2019s penises. If any babies cried, they would take the baby and the woman aside, hold the woman\u2019s breasts and force the baby to eat,\u201d she said. In another case, a 20-year-old Rohingya man, who was held for five months, described the conditions inside the camp, and the practice of dumping the dead or dying in isolated locations where no one would find them. \u201cThere were two camps like this, with 150 in each camp. We had to sleep on top of each other. Some people became sick in the camps after we were there a long time \u2026 Some were so sick but were still alive, but they were thrown into the mountain area. \u201cWhen people died, the guards forced the people to throw the bodies in the mountain area. I saw others do this. It was a big mountain and very high, so the people brought the bodies up the mountain and left them there.\u201d Matthew Smith, the executive director of Fortify Rights, said the accounts were indicative of \u201ca widespread pattern of death, torture, and exploitation, in many cases involving the complicity of Thai authorities\u201d. \u201cThe scale of this problem is enormous, and that wouldn\u2019t be news to Thai officials,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThe loss of life has been enormous. To say there are dozens of mass graves wouldn\u2019t scratch the surface. We\u2019re not in a position to assess specifically how many mass graves exist, but we have reason to believe it\u2019s far greater than any current estimates. There needs to be a proper international investigation involving forensic teams.\u201d The Thai government has been trying to improve its record on human trafficking, which after a recent parliamentary vote is now subject to the death penalty when victims die. Following the discovery of the grave sites, the Thai police have pledged to investigate the alleged involvement of local officials in trafficking activities, while Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has publicly ordered authorities across Thailand to \u201cto scan every inch of their areas\u201d for more camps. Human rights groups have expressed scepticism about these moves, however. Phil Robertson, deputy director for the Asia division of Human Rights Watch, said: \u201cDenials that the government didn\u2019t know what was going on are simply not credible. The Thai authorities have known about these camps for years, and in fact, senior government representatives admitted that to Human Rights Watch several years ago. It\u2019s an understatement to say that in national government circles there has been a bit of a \u2018Don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019 policy about these camps and what goes on in them. \u201cLocal officials in the areas where these camps operate, and on transit routes taken to send Rohingya to the camps, have been directly involved and profited by serving as local look-outs and protectors for the camps.\u201d Smith was similarly critical of officialdom. \u201cThai authorities have been fully aware of the existence of these camps, and they\u2019ve known very well what goes on there,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe have testimony that places Thai officials in trafficking camps negotiating with traffickers while hundreds of people are held captive. Torture, killings, deprivations, and other abuses have all occurred with impunity. We\u2019ve documented how Thai authorities have \u2018rescued\u2019 Rohingya asylum seekers and then sold or handed them to trafficking syndicates, who in turn tortured them.\u201d Heightening deprivations in Burma are driving more people into the hands of the traffickers, said a Rohingya community leaderin Rakhine, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cEvery single thing is under the control of the authorities,\u201d he said. \u201cThe boat drivers, the brokers \u2026 always have to negotiate with authorities. Without bribing the security forces [military or police], it is not easy to leave. But people are handed over again to the traffickers in Thailand or [near the] Malaysia border. From there, they will be released by paying around 30 lakhs kyats [about \u00a32,000]. People who cant afford to pay are sold out or killed.\u201d ", "publicationDate": "2015-05-06T13:50:52Z", "tags": ["Migration and development", "Global development", "Human rights", "Thailand", "Malaysia", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/06/thailand-human-trafficking-mass-grave-burma-rohingya-people", "title": "Thailand human trafficking death toll far greater than feared, claims rights group", "sentences": ["Human trafficking may have taken place in Thailand on a far greater scale than previously suspected, with dozens of mass graves containing the bodies of victims lying undiscovered throughout the country\u2019s south, according to testimony gathered by a Bangkok-based human rights group."]}, {"article": "With the first two of his three elegant, stylish and ambiguous novels \u2013 The Forgiven in 2012, The Ballad of a Small Player last year, and now Hunters in the Dark \u2013 Lawrence Osborne elicited comparisons to Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh, James Salter, Paul Bowles, among others. He seems to be a revenant from a species that has, paradoxically, become almost extinct following the triumph of globalisation: the traveller (or travel-writer)-novelist. Indeed, Osborne describes himself as having led \u201ca nomadic life\u201d, living in Paris, New York City, Mexico, Istanbul and Bangkok. The novels reflect this: The Forgiven is set in Morocco, Ballad in the gambling dens of Macau, Hunters in the Dark in Cambodia; all feature westerners running up against, or adrift in, cultures that remain opaque to them. For Osborne, the mysteriousness of these non-western cultures is not an excuse to satisfy anew the jaded occidental appetite for exoticism. Instead, he seems to be engaged in turning inside out, in startling ways, that old Jamesian theme of the confrontation of old and new worlds, of innocence versus experience, except that the new world here is the European one, \u201cdying on its feet of torpor and smugness and debt\u201d, from which Osborne\u2019s protagonists are in full flight. One such figure is 28-year old Robert, the central character of Hunters in the Dark. A schoolteacher in the tiny Sussex village of Elmer, Robert knows that his provincial English life is a cul-de-sac. The anomie that afflicts him is really despair at the pettiness and claustrophobia of England, at \u201ca way of life that justified itself as being the pinnacle of freedom, but [which] had not come up with an alternative reason for existing once the freedom had been sucked out of it\u201d. He leaves for Thailand, slowly settling into the decision not to return to that hated old life. The novel opens with Robert crossing over the border to Cambodia and gambling with the last of his savings to win $2,000. This stroke of luck sets into motion the machinery of a plot that comes to resemble a Newton\u2019s cradle, one sphere colliding with another and transferring its energy and momentum to it, and so on, in a long, complex series. Robert hires a driver, Ouksa, to take him around the sights and before long they run into a young American man, Simon Beaucamp, urbane, well dressed, handsome. Robert moves out of the flophouse in which he is staying and into the American\u2019s beautiful house on the river, despite warnings from Ouksa. Although it extends the horizons of the genre, Osborne\u2019s book remains a thriller on one level, so what happens next is best not revealed. Our hero finds himself in Phnom Penh, without any of his belongings, such as his bag, his passport and his winnings. Another stroke of luck occurs: he is engaged as an English tutor to a beautiful young Khmer woman, Sophal, the daughter of the rich Dr Sar, but Robert decides to call himself Simon Beaucamp in this new life. Meanwhile, the real Simon resurfaces in another strand of the story; in this, we\u2019ll encounter the chilling and amoral Davuth, a policeman who was a killer and torturer in the Pol Pot regime, with a key role to play in the plot. Ouksa, too, will resurface, as will Simon\u2019s Khmer girlfriend, Sothea; both are crucial players in the story. Dramatic irony, used sharply by Osborne, keeps the narrative edgy and gripping, but it is the meditation on luck, or chance, and the irrational, carried over from his previous novel, that gives Hunters its meaning. Robert is a deeply innocent man in an ancient land that has emerged from a period of immense trauma, and while his innocence is both alluring and dangerous, his rationalist European mentality is woefully unequipped to read a culture that places such great store on the irrational \u2013 on signs, omens, dreams, on the sixth sense, on ghosts and spirits; in short, everything that the European Enlightenment taught the western world to deride and debunk. As events remain inexplicable to him throughout, Robert retains his \u201cbeautifully ignorant\u201d self to the very end, but Osborne gives a sense of his European certainties eroding: \u201cKarma swirled around all things, lending them destinies over which mere desire had no control. It made one\u2019s little calculations irrelevant.\u201d It is a serious curtailment of the rationalist individualism that motors western life and has given rise, Osborne implies, to the drift and desperation of Robert\u2019s generation. In fact, that Newton\u2019s cradle of several unrelated lives brought into proximity by chance is the working out, on the level of plot, of the vector produced by several colliding systems of belief \u2013 Buddhist \u201cdharma\u201d, superstition, premonition, rationalism, even the teachings of the dreaded Angkar that had resulted in one of the worst genocides of the last century. Accordingly, recurrent images, tropes, metaphors of the irrational and portentous \u2013 a colony of bats, disturbed, rising up as one black mass; ghosts; astonishing cloud formations \u2013 provide an underlying structure to the novel. Written with unfailing precision and beauty, Hunters in the Dark stakes out territory different from the many writers to whom Osborne has been compared.

I spent most of that year in Thailand, fixated on war along the Burma border and poverty on the Issan plateau. The politics of home, even a presidential election, seemed remote and vaguely unimportant. As I recall, the somewhat conservative columnists in the Post mocked Clinton\u2019s accent and questioned whether he was \u201cpresidential\u201d. But for me it wasn\u2019t that deep. It was him or the incumbent, President GHW Bush. Bush sent some of my university friends to war in Kuwait and talked like someone\u2019s grandad. Clinton cared about the same things that I did, and seemed young(er) and cool(er). Of course, times were different then. I was young and having a blast riding around Thailand on an old Honda MTX. My aid career was a mere one year old. There were no such things as Sphere standards or the cluster system (pdf) and the internet was mainly in sci-fi films. South-east Asia was my world and I couldn\u2019t think beyond it. I had no intention of ever coming home or going anywhere else. And so, filling in my absentee ballot and running it over to Bangkok\u2019s US embassy on Wireless Road was little more than an afterthought at the time. Another necessary chore. Do my civic duty, participate in the democratic process and all that. It was literally half a morning\u2019s worth of effort, between my second coffee and my lunchtime plate of chicken-fried rice from a shop on Sukhumvit 55. Of course, I did eventually leave south-east Asia \u2013 to travel to other posts and to work at home too \u2013 and over the years that followed, US politics would occasionally stray into my life. On 4 February 1994, I was in Ho Chi Minh City, the day President Clinton ended the American embargo against Vietnam. You could feel the electricity in the air. There were celebrations. People lit firecrackers and sang karaoke. And there was Pepsi. Pepsi everywhere. I drank more Pepsi in Vietnam in 1994 than in all the rest of my life, before and after, combined. In 1998, a taxi driver in the Yemeni city of Mocha, on learning that I was American, turned around without taking his foot off the gas, to reach back and squeeze my knee affectionately and holler, \u201cBill K-lin-TON... VERY GOOD! HAHAHAHAHA!\u201d Late in the summer of 1999, an irate villager in Vojvodina (northern Serbia, just after Nato\u2019s \u201chumanitarian bombing\u201d) gesticulated wildly at a large chunk of a metal in his garden, a piece of an oil refinery 2km away that had been destroyed by Nato. He angrily accused Bill Clinton, and me by proxy, of targeting his garden, specifically. My local colleague looked at the ground and in a soft voice said something like, \u201cNext time just pretend to be German.\u201d And then, in 2001, before 9/11, there was the immigration official on the border between South Africa and Mozambique. Immigration official: \u201cOh, you\u2019re American.\u201d Me: \u201cYeah...\u201d Immigration official: \u201cGeorge Bush...\u201d [shakes head sadly] Me: \u201cYeah...\u201d Immigration official [brighter]: \u201cBut, Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton good!\u201d Me: \u201cYeah...\u201d Somehow, as an aid worker the temptation to somehow disengage with whatever drama is happening at home never goes away. After spending the day thinking about, say, conflict in the Central African Republic or the refugee influx into Jordan, it\u2019s tough to get worked up over changes to local zoning laws. But as I look back the Clinton-Bush election of 1992 \u2014 seen from afar, from the back of a bike \u2014 is still one of my favorites.

Particularly if you live in an urban area and your travel is mostly within that urban area (or to other urban areas) it may not make sense to have a car.  I am a pretty good example of this - I live in Frankfurt and got rid of the car 2 years ago. Since then I use a mixture of bike, public transport, and taxis. I use a car from a car-share scheme or one of the big hire shops when I specifically need a car, which is 1-2 days a month on average. This has reduced my mobility costs by 60%.

Bopstar    28 April 2015 10:59am   This comment has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate There are probably more vans, lorries, taxis and buses in London now than there were all vehicle types in the 70's. Also the public transport system can't take much more capacity. Not at peak times anyway. Also the tube needs to run 24h (yes I know it's coming on weekends) and even more importantly the trains need to run 24h in south London. I guess what I'm saying is unless there is huge investment, the car will be around for a good while.       Building solely for the needs of motor transport has proved a costly and deadly cul-de-sac, but reversing this lemming leap will take not just some cash, but lots of leadership, commitment and wrangling. Such commitment already exists in the Netherlands and Copenhagen where, by a variety of means, cycling as a mode of transport is not simply encouraged and promoted, but also aspired to and, most importantly, enabled. In most of the English speaking world, bike travel is mistakenly viewed as a problem that can and should be solved by means of infrastructure designed more for the needs of motor traffic, to be only grudgingly provided for specifically, but in general to be pushed aside or totally eliminated altogether. A mass cycling culture will only appear with the creation of safe spaces for cycling on. But in the UK we are many years away from having that outside some small pieces of London and a tiny number of other cities. It may cost money, but it will cost more in the long term to keep ignoring the elephant in the room. It has already been demonstrated almost everywhere properly designed protected bike lanes have been installed, that local business benefits, vulnerable road users benefit, and even those who continue to drive benefit. The UK\u2019s own DfT reported that protected bike infrastructure would recoup \u00a35 for every \u00a31 spent on it. - congokid   Living a car-free life is actually really cheap if you plan it right and the alternatives are accessible and low-cost. But for this process to be accelerated, we need that most hard to achieve thing: joined-up thinking. It is about ensuring easy and safe cycling and walking, cheap and convenient and reliable public transport, and a range of good value car hire schemes for those times when a car really is nice to use. The potential for a real societal shift is there - anyone who visits a range of cities from Rennes to Copenhagen can see that the move creates wonderful, liveable cities, and these are where people want to live. We just need more and more smart nudges to keep the process going. - PhilipD   The tram scheme in my nearest large city was scrapped, due to cost. Given this lack of infrastructure quality and expanse, can I assume that we\u2019re not going to be part of this car-free utopia? I am no fan of motorcars in city centres, or indeed the curse of cars in general. However, the truth of the matter is no British cities are even CLOSE to London public transport wise. Invest heavily first, or hands off my car! - shelltune      London has an extensive public transport network: but what about other cities? Photograph: Alamy    ... and it wouldn\u2019t work outside city centres Consensus is that towns and suburbs are unlikely to get the sort of infrastructure investment received by city centres \u2013 so for many people, cars remain the only reliable option for getting around.             Gelion    30 April 2015 10:16pm  This discussion commonly shows the partition between people who live in densely built up cities like London or Birmingham and those outside those cities. Having lived in both, I did not need a car in Sheffield, I lived 1 minute walk from a bus router and could go virtually anywhere in the city on bus, bike or tram.  Then I moved out and ever since have needed a car and currently own my own business with nationwide clients and I drive easily 500+ miles a week. We also live in the suburbs now and I would say that we need a car to access basic services because there is no public transport. So this leaves me needing a car for business &amp; home life. I don't care if it's a car I drive myself or an automatic, but in reality a large percent of the population will need access to personal vehicles for decades to come because many journeys cannot be catered for by public transport.                 Chriswr    28 April 2015 3:08pm  Cars + cities = bad (arguably)Cars + towns = essential. Cities have a critical mass of housing, leisure and employment so that you rarely need to leave them. And it's all dense enough to be served conveniently with public transport. And maybe car-sharing and taxis to fill in any gaps. But out in small town Britain (and many other countries) none of this applies. And the lower density living is appealing to families with children who typically need space. Out there cars are here to stay. And why not, they are twice as efficient as they were 20 years ago and with hybrids and electric cars coming along that progress is set to continue.

With all the infrastructure of roads, car parks and suburbs constructed over the past 50 years which assume car ownership. It will be much easier to adopt the electric car. Which is a shame in a way but there you go.       In Jakarta, Indonesia more than 1000 additional cars and motorcycles are added to an already overloaded road system every day! Not peak car here any time soon. - Platypus35  What about electric or shared cars? If the future doesn\u2019t get rid of cars entirely, could it see a different sort of car use? With electric cars mitigating pollution and shared car use cutting ownership, some readers discussed whether these transport formats could be the way forward.             WuffleFlump    28 April 2015 12:25pm   This comment has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate But electric cars do not solve the problem. They might pollute less, but they still take up more road space than the alternatives, they still need to be parked somewhere. They still sever neighbourhoods and discouraging walking, play, community on streets. Many of our cities had a troubled and incomplete adaption to the car in a short space of time. It is not so hard to reverse. Roads can still carry buses, trams, bikes, car parks can be turned into desperately needed housing. 60 and 70 flyovers are reaching the end of their structural life around now anyway.         Autolib, the electric car-share scheme in Paris. Photograph: Pawel Libera/LightRocket via Getty Images     Electric cars that use a battery recharged every day at home are not the solution. Perhaps the answer is electrified roads. Perhaps it is free electricity to recharge cars at all parking places in the city centre to encourage people to leave the big car at home. Let\u2019s see governments round the world investing in this technology. The big incentive is that whoever comes out with the winning technology will then be the world leader.   - habuta   I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily the car we need to ban completely from the city, but the internal combustion engine. Congestion is a bane for those who have to commute, but traffic noise and pollution have much wider reaching effects on our mental and physical health whether we drive or not. - nilpferd              LondonLungs    28 April 2015 10:03pm  The real change to cities will come with autonomous cars, once the roads become full of supersafe autonomous vehicles it will be much less stressful to cycle about, no more dangerous close passes, no more having to worry about being rear-ended by some fool playing with their mobile phone and no need to worry about being knocked flying by someone pulling out of a junction who simply doesn't see cyclists. The other blessing will be a changeover to electric cars or zero-emission cars. Right now it is disgusting cycling amongst fossil fuel burning vehicles and drivers are actually breathing in more fumes than cyclists (supposedly).                 Ben Williams    28 April 2015 1:53pm  The author has a point about the mode is car ownership changing. I live in inner Sydney, just outside the CBD, and subscribe to a car sharing scheme (&quot;Go Get&quot;). It's brilliant. You look up a car that is near you, book it instantly with your smartphone, and then just walk up to it, enter with a tap of your smart card, and drive off. It's so convenient and so much cheaper than owning a car that it's hard to see why we would buy our own.

Even though hundreds of people abandoned at sea by smugglers have reached land and relative safety in the past two days, thousands of Bangladeshis and Rohingya Muslims from Burma are believed still at risk. Worried that boats will start washing to shore with dead bodies, the UN high commissioner for refugees, the US and several other governments and international organisations have held emergency meetings, but participants say there are no immediate plans to search for vessels in the busy Malacca Strait. One of the concerns is what to do with the Rohingya if a rescue is launched. The minority group is denied citizenship in Burma, and other countries have long worried that opening their doors to a few would result in an unstoppable flow of poor, uneducated migrants.   Related: Burma census is not counting Rohingya Muslims, says UN agency    \u201cThese are people in desperate straits,\u201d said Phil Robertson, of Human Rights Watch in Bangkok. He called on governments to band together to help those still stranded at sea, some for two months or longer. \u201cTime is not on their side,\u201d he said. For decades the Rohingya have suffered state-sanctioned discrimination in Buddhist-majority Burma, which considers them illegal settlers from Bangladesh even though their families have lived there for generations. In the past three years attacks on the religious minority, numbering about 1.3m, have left up to 280 people dead and forced 140,000 from their homes. They live in crowded camps just outside the Rakhine state capital, Sittwe, where they have little access to school or adequate health care. The conditions at home \u2013 and lack of jobs \u2013 have sparked one of the biggest exoduses of boat people since the Vietnam war. Chris Lewa, director of the non-profit Arakan project, which has been monitoring boat departures and arrivals for more than a decade, estimates more than 100,000 men, women and children have boarded ships since mid-2012. Most are trying to reach Malaysia, but recent regional crackdowns on human trafficking networks have sent brokers and agents into hiding, making it impossible for migrants to disembark even after family members have paid $2,000 or more, she said. Lewa believes up to 6,000 Rohingya and Bangladeshis are still crowded on small and large boats in the Malacca Strait and nearby international waters. With limited access to food and clean water, their health is deteriorating, she said, adding that dozens of deaths have been reported. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned about smugglers abandoning boatloads at sea,\u201d said Lewa.

An Indonesian navy spokesman, Manahan Simorangkir, said they had been trying to get to Malaysia. \u201cWe didn\u2019t intend to prevent them from entering our territory, but because their destination country was not Indonesia, we asked them to continue to the country where they actually want to go,\u201d he said.

It\u2019s altogether a relief,\u201d the man said. Late on Sunday night police found a big wooden ship trapped in shallow waters at a beach on Langkawi, an island off Malaysia, and have since found 865 men, 101 women and 52 children, said Jamil Ahmed, the area\u2019s deputy police chief.  He said many appeared weak and thin and that at least two other boats had not been found. \u201cWe believe there may be more boats coming,\u201d Jamil said.

Photograph: Hamzah Osman/AP    Thailand has long been considered a regional hub for human traffickers. The tactics of brokers and agents started changing in November as authorities began tightening security on land, a move apparently aimed at appeasing the US government as it prepared to release its annual Trafficking in Persons report in June. Last year, Thailand was downgraded to the lowest level, putting it on par with North Korea and Syria. Rohingya packing into ships in the Bay of Bengal have been joined in growing numbers by Bangladeshis. Until recently their first stop was Thailand, where they were held in open pens in jungle camps as brokers collected \u201cransoms\u201d from relatives. Those who could pay continued on to Malaysia or other countries. Those who could not were sometimes beaten, killed or left to die. Since 1 May, police have found two dozen bodies in shallow graves in the mountains of southern Thailand. Thai authorities have since arrested dozens of people, including a powerful mayor and a man named Soe Naing, otherwise known as Anwar, who was accused of being one of the trafficking kingpins in southern Thailand. More than 50 police officers are also being investigated. Spooked by the arrests, smugglers are abandoning ships, sometimes disappearing in speedboats, with rudimentary instructions about where to go. Vivian Tan, the UN refugee agency\u2019s regional press officer in Bangkok, said there was real sense of urgency from the international community. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m not sure what the concrete next steps are or should be,\u201d she said about meetings with diplomats and international organisations. \u201cBut there doesn\u2019t seem to be a clear mechanism in this region for responding to something like this.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2015-05-12T03:20:38Z", "tags": ["Refugees", "Bangladesh", "Indonesia", "Asia Pacific", "South and Central Asia", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/12/fears-up-to-6000-south-east-asian-boat-people-are-abandoned-at-sea", "title": "Fears up to 6,000 asylum seekers are trapped at sea off south-east Asia", "sentences": ["Related: Burma census is not counting Rohingya Muslims, says UN agency    \u201cThese are people in desperate straits,\u201d said Phil Robertson, of Human Rights Watch in Bangkok.", "Vivian Tan, the UN refugee agency\u2019s regional press officer in Bangkok, said there was real sense of urgency from the international community."]}, {"article": "Malaysia said on Wednesday it would no longer accept new arrivals of ethnic minority Rohingya fleeing persecution in Burma, as the UN refugee agency expressed surprise that south-east Asian nations were now turning back boats.

We cannot tell them we are welcoming them.\u201d He said Malaysia would only consider rescuing asylum seekers on humanitarian grounds if their boats had capsized. He added that a meeting will be convened soon involving Burma and Bangladeshi embassy officials to discuss how to send the migrants back. His statement signals a change in stance for authorities in Muslim-majority Malaysia, which in the past quietly tolerated the arrival of Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority in predominantly Buddhist Burma. For many Rohingyas, relatively affluent Malaysia came to be seen as one of the last safe havens in a region where many countries have been cracking down on boat people in recent years. Rohingya asylum seekeers in Malaysia were given documents issued by the UN refugee agency, acknowledging their need to be protected, although the country is not a signatory to the UN refugee convention. While they are not officially allowed to work, authorities turn a blind eye to those working in the informal sector. International groups have expressed concerned at the south-east Asian nations\u2019 decision to turn away migrant boats, a controversial practice that has been used by Australia against immigrants seeking to reach its shores and has sparked heated debate. \u201cUNHCR is surprised at reports of Indonesia turning back one of the boats,\u201d its Bangkok-based regional spokeswoman Vivian Tan said. \u201cSuch a practice is inconsistent with Indonesia\u2019s search-and-rescue efforts to date, which have focused on saving lives. \u201cWe continue to appeal to countries in the region to share responsibility and avert a humanitarian crisis.\u201d Some of the estimated 8,000 Bangladeshi and Rohingya boat people have been on the perilous sea journey since early March and are in urgent need of medical treatment to save their lives, International Organisation for Migration Asia-Pacific spokesman Joe Lowry said.

He said they face deportation once the immigration authorities complete their investigation, and that Malaysia is stepping up sea patrols along its borders \u201cto prevent any further illegal encroachment into Malaysian waters\u201d. The sudden jump in the number of migrants stuck at sea comes after Thailand cracked down on people-smuggling networks following the grim discovery of mass graves along the Thai-Malaysia border, a traditional route for the Rohingya.

Related: South-east Asia faces its own migrant crisis as states play 'human ping-pong'    Lilianne Fan Bangkok-based expert on humanitarian and conflict issues in Asia, research associate at the humanitarian policy group of the UK\u2019s Overseas Development Institute The solution really has to be a humanitarian approach, making sure lives are not lost and looking at temporary solutions in each of the affected countries \u2013 Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. You need to have a solution coordinated at the regional level but you also need to think about trying to really work with the Burmese government, within the Rakhine state in particular, to make sure conditions are being improved to the point that it is not a push factor for the Rohingya Muslims to leave.  Fundamentally this is an issue of statelessness and citizenship. The approach that Asean (Association of South-east Asian Nations) will have to take is one that doesn\u2019t necessarily push Burma too hard on the citizenship issue right now but looks at improving conditions more from a humanitarian and development point of view, stabilising conditions while the discussion on eventual citizenship and status takes place. This will be a long discussion, and it won\u2019t be easy.  The temporary solution is a settlement arrangement for the asylum seekers and refugees who are coming to these countries. There has to be a mechanism and strategy at the regional level that allows countries of the Asean region to have an oversight on coordinated management \u2013 a strategy that looks at how to actually manage the population that has arrived temporarily. The approach might be slightly different in every country, but it has to be an overarching strategy. The Bangladeshi economic migrants need to have a separate process and how they should be managed will be different. One thing that is very clear is that the affected governments \u2013 Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia \u2013 are very torn by this issue. It is not an easy decision for them to say they don\u2019t want the boats to come \u2013 this is something we have to realise. Charles Santiago  Chair of Asean Parliamentarians for Human Rights, a coalition of lawmakers advocating for fundamental rights in south-east Asia Asean really has to deal with this issue. It is no longer a Burma issue, it has become a regional issue. A regional issue that has to be dealt with at the regional level. There is a lot to do in terms of applying pressure on Burma. The problem starts with the Burma government refusing to give citizenship to the Rohingya. They are all in detention camps, they are persecuted because of their race, skin colour and religion. This is a society that has been highly persecuted. This has to come to a stop.  Asean has to put pressure on Burma in order to make changes to the lives of people in Rakhine state. This is a long-term strategy. The short-term strategies would be for these countries \u2013 Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand \u2013 to save those on the boats. Right now you have to save lives. Asean\u2019s non-interference policy has to come to a stop. Asean governments cannot hide behind an archaic policy, now a human catastrophe is taking place in front of our eyes. We talk about being caring and people-centred, but the people of south-east Asia need their governments to act in a responsible fashion. David Manne  Executive director of the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre, Australia, and principal solicitor and migration agent Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia should immediately cease their pushback of boats and render rescue and humanitarian aid. Humanity must be put before politics, and rescue at sea before border enforcement. Australia must show regional leadership by doing all within its power and capacity to save lives at sea through emergency logistical, financial and humanitarian assistance. Many of the asylum seekers at sea are stranded and suffering from starvation, having been pushed back from seeking refuge in Thailand, Malaysia or Indonesia.  Australia should urge joint operations between key states to rescue these people, and should then work with other countries to provide vital assistance which ensures they are humanely treated, their claims fairly assessed, and that those in need of protection are resettled to safety. Deterrence of asylum seekers does nothing to address the desperation and dangers which force people to flee \u2013 it just sweeps people from one doorstep to dangers and possible death elsewhere. Nations in our region must stop constructing a fortress around the bloodied fields in front of them. What we need is for these countries \u2013 and the international community \u2013 to come together and to uphold the existing protection obligations which are owed to desperate people fleeing from persecution, and to strengthen strategies which are firmly founded in human dignity, human rights and international cooperation. Jeff Labovitz  Chief of mission, International Organisation for Migration, Thailand The first possible solution is that all surrounding countries must commit boats to search and rescue, and let these boats land. They should also work together to up surveillance and to find and locate boats and track where they are. If there needs to be greater regional solutions they could possibly involve the Bali process (the Bali process on people smuggling, trafficking in persons and related transnational crime). Thailand is holding a summit on 29 May, but that\u2019s two weeks away, and we need to get together on a more urgent basis now. Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia need to share information, share any satellite information they have and to work out where people can disembark. They can coordinate that information with organisations such as IOM and others to make sure there\u2019s assistance on the ground. All the countries of the region need to get together to see what the root problems are. They have been sharing some information about smuggling networks but they haven\u2019t done enough between countries. Essentially, there are no departures now. For the moment, it\u2019s stopped. But the operation was huge \u2013 13,000 people left in one month at the end of last year. We need communication, points of control, joint patrols and sharing of information, as well as identified points of contact.

Salam, a Rohingya from northern Burma, was not exaggerating in her depiction of that grim choice, judging by a report from researchers at Queen Mary, University of London, which warns that her people are facing state-sponsored genocide. \u201cThe Rohingya are faced with two options: stay and face annihilation, or flee,\u201d said Professor Penny Green, part of a group that recently completed several months\u2019 research in the Rohingya\u2019s home state of Rakhine. \u201cIf we understand genocide to be a process, that is what this is. Those who remain suffer destitution, malnutrition and starvation; severe physical and mental illness; restrictions on movement, education, marriage, childbirth, livelihood, land ownership; and the ever-present threat of violence and corruption.\u201d Since 1982 the group has been refused citizenship by the Burmese government, which denies their existence. Officials will not attend events, at home or internationally, where the word Rohingya is used, and last week threatened to boycott a summit on the escalating migrant crisis which had been called by Thailand.       \u201cIf they use the term Rohingya, we won\u2019t take part in it, since we don\u2019t recognise this term. The Myanmar government has been protesting against the use of it all along,\u201d Zaw Htay, an official from the president\u2019s office, told Reuters on Saturday. Instead it insists that a group with its own language and a history in Burma that goes back many generations must be called Bengalis, and describes them as illegal immigrants from neighbouring Bangladesh. That alienation has led to a vast chain of \u201crefugee\u201d camps which Green says are more like prisons, home to more than 100,000 Rohingya who require permission to leave them. In the regional capital of Sittwe, once a thriving mixed city with dozens of mosques, a few thousand Rohingya still live in a ghetto with seven heavily guarded entrances. The number of mosques still standing is in single figures a nd they are deserted, occupied by government forces. A trickle of food aid into the camps keeps people alive but hungry on a meagre diet of rice and lentils, while in the city\u2019s markets there are bags of food aid apparently siphoned off by officials with little care for the camps\u2019 inhabitants. \u201cThey live the barest of existences,\u201d Green says. \u201cPeople were begging us for food. You walk around and see blank eyes.\u201d The government also tolerates Islamophobia and screeds of hatred in the media, Green said, fostering an ugly atmosphere that easily flares into violence. More than 200 Rohingya were killed in attacks in 2012 for which no one has been tried or even arrested. \u201cWe asked why there were no prosecutions or investigations, and the prosecutor said it was because it happened at night, so no one could see what happened.\u201d It is this living death that the Rohingya have been trying to flee for years, some across the border into Bangladesh, but thousands by sea, even though they know the smuggling trade is vicious and predatory and the journey could cost their lives. The pace of departures has picked up, with up to 25,000 setting off from the Bay of Bengal between January and March, double the levels in 2013 and 2014, a UN report on \u201cirregular maritime movements\u201d in the region found. More than 300 migrants died of starvation, dehydration and beatings by boat crews, survivors told the UN. It is possible that others died unrecorded deaths as they set off in ships no more seaworthy or less crowded than those that frequently founder in the Mediterranean. \u201cA few interviewees also told of entire boats sinking, but there was no way to verify such reports or if, and how many, lives were lost,\u201d the UN said in a report on the sea traffic. Many of the women endure rape or other sexual violence on the boats or while waiting to travel, and many others are forced into marriage with men who pay for their journey. Mothers travelling with children are also particularly vulnerable to starvation, as young travellers are given no rations so women often go hungry to ensure that their sons and daughters can eat. This desperate exodus has been going on for years, largely unnoticed until regional governments that had been taking in the migrants started turning away men, women and children who had spent weeks at sea. There are perhaps as many as 8,000 people now adrift in a hellish maritime limbo, refused permission to land by the Indonesian, Malaysian and Thai governments after being handed basic provisions of food and water, unlikely to last out their uncharted journeys. \u201cThe situation is very grave,\u201d Joe Lowry, a spokesman for the International Organisation for Migration in Bangkok, told Reuters. \u201cThey have no food, no water and are drinking their own urine. This is a game of maritime ping-pong with human life. We expect governments in the region to find a solution rapidly ... or we will be finding boatloads of desiccated corpses floating around in the Andaman Sea in coming days.\u201d Earlier in the week about 2,000 people were allowed to land; it was not clear how officials were deciding who should receive assistance and who were sent on their way. Turning the boats away was \u201cincomprehensible and inhumane\u201d, the UN\u2019s top human rights official warned, as other UN organisations begged the governments to take them in and promised to help with food and transport costs. \u201cIn the name of humanity, let these migrants land,\u201d said William Lacy Swing, director general of the International Organisation for Migration, which has already offered $1m in funding. Pushing the desperate migrants back out to sea may also be illegal, as it violates obligations enshrined in global maritime law, according to the International Chamber of Shipping. \u201cIt\u2019s a well-honoured maritime tradition for ships to rescue anyone in distress at sea, but coastal states also have an obligation to come to the rescue, and we expect them to honour this, including taking migrants ashore,\u201d said ICS spokesman Simon Bennett. The countries turning migrants away are apparently worried about their capacity to absorb a fast-growing number of poor, uneducated arrivals. But critics say they share responsibility for the current crisis by shying away from dealing with the root cause of the migration \u2013 policies in Burma that rights groups say amount to state-sponsored ethnic cleansing. \u201cRegional countries are reaping what they have sown for their policy of denial for years, and even with boatloads of desperate people in their waters they\u2019re refusing to act,\u201d said David Mathieson, senior researcher on Burma for Human Rights Watch. \u201cThey are tantamount to co-conspirators in the repression of the Rohingya for years, because of their weak response to the export of Burma\u2019s discriminatory policy to a stateless minority that has evinced more hatred than mercy throughout Asia.\u201d In its first official response to the crisis, the Burmese government denied any of the people stranded at sea were its citizens. \u201cWe cannot say the migrants are from Myanmar unless we can identify them,\u201d a government spokesman, Ye Htut, told the Associated Press. \u201cMost victims of human trafficking claim they are from Myanmar; it is very easy and convenient for them.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2015-05-16T23:05:08Z", "tags": ["South and Central Asia", "World news", "Refugees", "Thailand", "Bangladesh"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/17/rohingya-burma-refugees-boat-migrants", "title": "Burma\u2019s boatpeople \u2018faced choice of annihilation or risking their lives at sea\u2019", "sentences": ["\u201cThe situation is very grave,\u201d Joe Lowry, a spokesman for the International Organisation for Migration in Bangkok, told Reuters."]}, {"article": "The husband of a British woman who reportedly drowned while on holiday in Thailand at the weekend has said her death has left him \u201cin absolute tatters\u201d.

Manila, a signatory to the United Nation\u2019s refugee convention, said it would help as it denied a local report claiming that the Philippines planned to push back boats carrying some 8,000 people fleeing persecution in Burma and poverty in Bangladesh.  \u201cThe Philippines has extended humanitarian assistance to ... \u2018boat people\u2019 and had even established a processing centre for Vietnamese travellers in the 70s,\u201d said Herminio Coloma, a spokesman for the president, Benigno Aquino. \u201cWe shall continue to do our share in saving lives under existing and long-standing mechanisms pursuant to our commitments under the [UN] convention.\u201d  It would be a long and unlikely journey for the migrants \u2013 who are believed to be in the region of the Andaman Sea \u2013 to make it to the Philippines on their rickety boats with little food and fuel.

In questions on notice to the Senate committee investigating corporate tax avoidance, News Corp answered some questions but not all that the committee had asked. \u201cWe understand that the \u2018high\u2019 categorisation given to us denotes the complexity of the company and therefore the time and resources required to monitor the complex taxation issue. What it means is that we are subject to continuous review from the ATO,\u201d the CFO, Susan Panuccio said. Journalist Neil Chenoweth from the Australian Financial Review has been dogged in his pursuit of this story, and is a constant thorn in Murdoch\u2019s side, writing that News Corp\u2019s accounts reveal that its 2013-14 tax refund was even larger than reported, at $923m. But you can always rely on the Australian\u2019s Darren Davidson to put a positive spin on News Corp affairs. Under the headline \u201cNews Corp Australia tax \u2018complex\u2019\u201d Davidson wrote that News had \u201cexplained its appearance on the Australian Taxation Office\u2019s high classification list, saying the media company\u2019s complex corporate structure after a demerger warranted closer inspection\u201d. \u201cResponding to a request for further information, chief financial officer Susan Panuccio says the company is incurring and paying substantial tax on its operations in Australia, noting the high categorisation \u2018does not imply that we are not paying the correct amount of tax\u2019,\u201d Davidson wrote. It\u2019s this kind of reporting that has led to a war between some AFR scribes and Davidson.

Channel 7 delivers another blow to staff A little over a year after Channel 7 axed its nightly current affairs show, Today Tonight, in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, the network has delivered another blow to staff. As a cost-saving measure Channel 7 has disbanded its investigative and features unit supervised by former ABC and Nine news chief Max Uechtritz.  The unit was responsible for filing stories for the remaining Adelaide and Perth editions of Today Tonight as well as delivering major news specials like MH370, Rolf Harris and the Sydney Lindt cafe siege. Shocked staff were told at a meeting on Wednesday that Uechtritz had decided he didn\u2019t want to hang around after the restructure and was leaving.  Uechtritz was behind the network\u2019s successful Anzac specials and may return for special projects. The jobs of the remaining journos from the unit are uncertain but some staffers will be redeployed. Channel 7\u2019s news division is under huge pressure from a resurgent Nine News. ABC downsizes Delhi bureau     (From left) ABC cook Suzy Ramesh with Delhi correspondent Stephanie March, former south Asia correspondent Michael Edwards\u2019 wife Fleur and daughter Sayuri, and other local staff. Photograph: Supplied    Suzy Ramesh has been a key staff member of the ABC\u2019s south Asia bureau in Delhi for 20 years, working for a string of foreign correspondents from Edmund Roy to Jonathan Harley, Geoff Thompson, Peter Lloyd, Michael Edwards and in recent months Stephanie March.  By all accounts Ramesh has been more than a cook: she has been a translator, cultural ambassador and guide. But Ramesh will lose her position in June as the ABC downsizes its Delhi bureau to a single-person VJ model.  Delhi is one of a handful of overseas bureaus, including Tokyo and Bangkok, targeted by a restructure aimed at reducing the significant expense of employing a fully-staffed team of journalists, camera operators and producers. While the other Delhi support staff received their redundancy entitlements after decades of service, Ramesh was classified as a household staff member which meant she missed out. The recently returned Delhi correspondent Edwards and his wife Fleur have launched a fundraising page to ensure Ramesh has some financial security after all her hard work. \u201cSadly, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s Delhi Bureau will be downsized this year,\u201d they wrote on the page. \u201cWe are grateful that so many of the staff there have been given their entitlements to recognise the decades of service to the ABC and its staff. Unfortunately, Suzy\u2019s classification as a household staff member means she misses out on these entitlements. So we are asking our family, friends and colleagues, and especially those who have enjoyed some of Suzy\u2019s amazing hospitality over the years, to contribute to her \u2018redundancy payout\u2019.  \u201cAs you know, even $20 goes a long way in India and so we would be very grateful if you would show your appreciation with a donation through this site.\u201d  ABC staffers have showed their appreciation and have been very generous, some donating as much as $1,000 to the fund which aims to raise $8,000 by the end of the month.  Fairfax\u2019s Jason Koutsoukis departs Delhi The downsizing of foreign bureaus continues. Fairfax Media\u2019s Delhi bureau has also quietly closed. Jason Koutsoukis, the south Asia correspondent for the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald based in Delhi has packed up and left. Sources told Weekly Beast that Koutsoukis won\u2019t be replaced. The editor-in-chief of the Sydney Morning Herald, Darren Goodsir, said: \u201cJason\u2019s contract finished with us recently and we are currently reviewing our plans for Delhi.\u201d     Former editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, Amanda Wilson. Photograph: Access PR/AAP    Barangaroo lures ex-Fairfax editor The first female editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, Amanda Wilson, has been consulting and serving on boards (Crime Stoppers and the Life Changing Experiences Foundation) since she lost her position so dramatically in 2012.  Wilson was a victim of the Fairfax Media editors purge in June of that year ahead of a major restructure which saw the loss of 1,900 staff. Wilson, as well as the Herald\u2019s publisher, Peter Fray, and the Age\u2019s editor-in-chief, Paul Ramadge, all walked out on the same day after tearful goodbyes to staff. (Fray is now an editor at the Australian.) But now she is coming back to the cutting edge of Sydney affairs with a new position which will see her on the other side of the journalistic divide.  Wilson starts next month as the full-time community engagement and communications director for the Barangaroo Delivery Authority, the site of the development of James Packer\u2019s $1.5bn luxury casino and hotel in Sydney. With her old paper reporting almost daily on the legal, political and environmental aspects of the project, dubbed \u201cPacker\u2019s palace\u201d by opponents, Wilson will surely earn her substantial package.

Cape Tribulation Two and half hours from Cairns, Cape Tribulation sees two heritage sites meet: the Daintree Rainforest and the Great Barrier Reef. You\u2019ll avoid any family fights with the reef and rainforest both in close proximity. You can be snorkelling in the Great Barrier Reef one day and exploring the forests the next. It\u2019s a bit more rugged than the usual beach destinations, but it\u2019s good for those that don\u2019t really want a touristy holiday. Isolated accommodation among the rainforest will also make it feel like a private getaway. Return flights from Brisbane to Cairns for two adults, two children from $872 with TigerAir. Accommodation at Daintree Crocodylus from $85 per night for a family room. Brisbane departure for a Great Barrier Reef Cruise Setting sail from Brisbane, this cruise ships travels as far north as Port Douglas across seven nights, with visits to Airlie Beach, Yorkeys Knob, and Willis Island along the way.  There are supervised entertainment programs for the kids while the adults can enjoy a range of restaurants and bars, as well as stage shows and roaming entertainers. All the meals at the silver-service restaurants are included in the ticket. Quad rooms from $517 per person, P&amp;O cruise begins on 27 June.

Hobart Don\u2019t let the icy cool weather deter you, Tasmania transforms into a winter wonderland during this time of year and there are plenty of indoor activities to keep you occupied. Lose yourself in the giant and world-renowned Museum of Old and New Art (Mona) \u2013 but a word of warning, not all the works are suitable viewing for young children \u2013 or explore the port town\u2019s historic buildings.  Soaring above the city, Mount Wellington offers a chance to show your children some snow, as well as incredible views (on a clear day). If the cold gets to be a bit much, venture 45 minutes out of town to the Hastings Cave State Reserve, and sit back and relax in thermal streams, which normally sit at 28C. This is for a family that wants to fully embrace a real winter holiday and the cold weather. Flights from Adelaide to Hobart from $1,672 return for two adults and two children with Virgin Australia.

There\u2019s a smoking room, where guys in linen suits (seriously!) light up, play pool and drink whisky; there\u2019s a screening room that shows black and white movies from Hollywood\u2019s golden age; and in the suites there are deep, lovely clawfoot baths where you can wash away the humidity and sweat of life in the hot zone.  During my stay at the Majestic (a 51-room hotel that combines neoclassical and art deco style), every afternoon the lobby was full of people enjoying English-style high tea \u2013 with plates of cakes, scones and pots of tea. Being serendaded by the piano \u201ctakes guests back to 1932\u201d, one of the staff told me.     The Majestic Hotel, Kuala Lumpur.

Many of the Portuguese- and Dutch-era buildings have been restored and renovated, but one of my favourites is the Galle Fort Hotel.  Restored to its former glory, the hotel is one of the pricier places to stay in town (up to $320 a night in peak season) \u2013 but you can soak up the vibe simply by having a G&amp;T in the hotel\u2019s bar, which is a pleasant porch area out the front where you can sit amid the tropical blossoms and watch the street life pass by. Cafe Batavia and Hermitage Hotel, Jakarta, Indonesia Colonial Jakarta is a crumbly mess: beautiful old buildings with white cracked paint and trees growing out the windows; boarded-up windows and creaky narrow staircases where ravens now nest. It\u2019s as if the city doesn\u2019t have the heart to tear down the old buildings but lacks the money to restore them.  There is one notable exception \u2013 Cafe Batavia. Originally built circa 1805-1850 as administration offices before becoming an art gallery in 1990, an Australian, Graham James, bought it in 1991 and reopened it as Cafe Batavia in 1993. There are black and white pictures all over the walls, an old piano and historical trinkets. The food is a pricey by Indonesian standards but the atmosphere is like stepping back in time.  If you want to stay at a heritage hotel in Jakarta, then the Hermitage Hotel is a welcome change from many of the capital\u2019s gleaming chain hotels. Situated in the historical district of Menteng, in central Jakarta, the hotel is in an art deco building from 1923 that was once a Dutch Telecommunications office.     Cafe Batavia in Jakarta.

Now branded as a health and wellness resort, with an excellent spa, it\u2019s buildings and furniture hark back to Dutch colonial times. In the central lobby, ceiling fans, wide day beds, a large verandah and a piano all add to the colonial vibe and afternoon tea is served daily. The hotel was a favourite of the former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and only a few hours away from the incredible Borobudur temple complex.

Built in 1901, the three-storey, five-star hotel boasts that it\u2019s one of south-east Asia\u2019s \u201cfew grand colonial hotels and one of its most awe inspiring\u201d. All the rooms were booked out when I visited Rangoon a few months ago (you need to book a long way in advance \u2013 there\u2019s a shortage of hotel rooms in the capital) but there were plenty of seats at the bar.

Open in 1887, Raffles Hotel Singapore is a prime example of colonial architecture, boasting period furniture and a tropical garden.  High tea is popular at Raffles \u2013 and you\u2019re encouraged to book ahead. It\u2019s the usual fare of cakes and crustless sandwiches served on a three-tiered stand, in the beautiful Tiffin Room. While you nibble on your sandwiches, a harpist plays in the background.

Passengers feast on toasted sandwiches, tea and freshly brewed coffee before taking one of a choice of seats. Some even get to light up a cigarette out the back.  That\u2019s because 300,000 people in Turkey\u2019s biggest city take the ferry to work every day.  \u201cBesides enjoying a peaceful ride, it was the fastest way to reach the office,\u201d said graphic designer Baris Akdogan who took the boat between the city\u2019s European and Asian shores to work every day until early this year. \u201cThe alternatives can be a real pain \u2026 [the] bus takes at least an hour or the subway can be really crowded,\u201d said fellow passenger Melike Son, a project manager who gets breakfast on board.  In Istanbul, more than 100 ferries and sea buses carry up to 2,100 commuters per trip with many routes served by eight departures an hour. The Istanbul Deniz Otobusleri (IDO) or Istanbul Sea Bus company, the largest maritime transport corporation in the world, carried 47 million passengers around the city last year, with a similar number using other ferry companies in the city. But around the world, holding up ferry transport as a serious commuting alternative has regularly been ridiculed. Critics maintain they are too slow and expensive, can reach only selected parts of a city and are no match for mass transit systems such as subway trains or even buses.    Among the criticisms heard in New York are that fares are too expensive, winters are too cold, and the ferries too slow          Passengers on New York\u2019s Staten Island ferry. Photograph: Alamy     In February, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio announced that a new ferry service for the city is to begin operating in 2017. New York is \u201cthe ultimate coastal city,\u201d he said, and plans to spend $55m (\u00a336m) linking Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and elsewhere by boat. As in Istanbul, De Blasio\u2019s plan would see ferry fares the same as bus and subway, and outlying districts are expected to enjoy increased service.  \u201cCurrently New York misses an opportunity for market expansion by not being better integrated,\u201d said Roberta Weisbrod, a maritime consultant and executive director of Worldwide Ferry Safety Association. \u201cBut there are strong hopes that that will change in the near future.\u201d  Among the criticisms heard in New York is that fares are too expensive, winters too cold for ferry use and that ferries can\u2019t move people as quickly as subway trains.  \u201cMy concerns are classic even among ferry enthusiasts [and] include whether specific routes will attract adequate ridership, require significantly higher levels of operating subsidies than other modes of transport,\u201d said Gene Russianoff from the Straphangers public transport advocacy organisation, who calls himself \u201ca ferry sceptic, not a ferry opponent\u201d.  There\u2019s much world cities can learn from the example set by Turkey\u2019s biggest metropolis. Unlike Istanbul\u2019s ferry system, New York\u2019s Pier 11 at Wall Street, for example, has no bus or mass transit connections. London\u2019s Woolwich Ferry is forced to compete with a footbridge and light rail serving the same route.     New York\u2019s proposed ferry network     \u201cWe\u2019re well on our way to reaching our goal of getting 12 million passengers on the Thames by 2020,\u201d said Andy Thompson, Transport for London\u2019s (TfL\u2019s) head of London river services, \u201cand TfL demand models suggest river bus commuter numbers could double in the next five years with the right investment in new piers and riverside development delivery.\u201d  But even if they do, ferry traffic would account for just 20 million of the current 3.5 billion annual journeys taken in London.  In other cities, ferry infrastructure is popular mainly because it is well integrated. Manly Wharf in Sydney\u2019s north-east is connected to a fleet of buses that move commuters deep into suburbia, and the Hong Kong-mainland China passenger ferry line is linked by coach to a host of Chinese provinces.  Something New York and many other city ferries lack are the lateral-thrust propellers that give many Istanbul boats a critical edge in attracting travellers. The propellers help ferries pull up alongside docks allowing passengers to embark and disembark quickly. In the way the airline Ryanair whittles profit from its ultra-quick turnaround schedule, the Istanbul ferry system is able to do likewise, and it must.    With projected ridership of over 36 million by 2018, ferry services \u200b\u200bare a substantial part of New York's transit mix        Istanbul\u2019s ferries remain popular because they are deeply connected to other transport systems. In Kadikoy, a teeming district on Istanbul\u2019s Asian shore, just 20 steps separate ferry stations from the entrance of a 16-stop metro line that stretches to the city southern limits. A two-minute walk brings commuters to a major bus terminal.  What\u2019s more, Istanbul is able to call on a series of natural advantages many other cities can\u2019t. A history of popular, municipal-run ferry use dates back to 1853, predating the first Bosphorus bridge \u2013 the only alternative way to cross the city \u2013 by 120 years. As a result, much of Istanbul\u2019s central shoreline is publicly owned, unlike in cities across the Atlantic such as New York or San Diego. Pensioners (and accredited journalists) travel for free on Istanbul\u2019s public transport and locals say ferries are a link to the city\u2019s historical soul.  Despite this, the city\u2019s ferries face a challenging future. A city whose population has increased 15-fold since 1960 means residents are increasingly moving inland to find affordable housing. Despite the equivalent of the entire population of Pittsburgh using ferries every day, that represents just a tiny percentage of Istanbul\u2019s overall commuter total; the majority use metrobuses that run on dedicated highway lanes.  Local media reports that the IDO is losing money to a combination of competition and mismanagement, and city authorities are planning to reduce ferry services on some routes. Even as Istanbul has been recently noted as the world\u2019s most congested city, ferry traffic is falling as authorities invest more in underwater rail and road transportation systems linking the European and Asian districts. And though its ferry service may be romantic and relaxing, it can\u2019t compete with modern technology: the recently opened Marmaray train line takes passengers under the Bosphorus Strait in just four minutes.  The future of ferry commuting will be coloured by faster, cleaner vessels \u2013 though experts say they\u2019re unlikely to ever be the centrepiece of urban transportation. The Norwegian Zero Cat 120, the world\u2019s first battery-powered, zero-emission car ferry, is set to begin operating this year. However, this model needs to be recharged after every six-kilometre trip, and in cities prone to blackouts caused by storms and hurricanes, would result in chaos.   Related: Has the time come for floating cities?     Others look to forecasts of increased passenger traffic as a sign of the strength of the ferry. \u201cWith projected ridership of over 36 million by 2018, ferry services are a substantial part of the transit mix in New York,\u201d said Roland Lewis of the Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance, a pro-ferry non-governmental organisation.   Weisbrod thinks the broader future of urban ferry use looks similarly positive. \u201cIt is an old form of transport that was supplanted by bus, auto and train [but] Sydney, Brisbane, Stockholm, London, New York and Bangkok already have linear urban ferries; Manila, the most dense city on earth, just started a linear urban service on the Passig River; Mumbai is considering coastal service,\u201d she said.   \u201cNow that those forms are suffering congestion, ferry transport is being reconsidered.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2015-05-28T12:13:43Z", "tags": ["Cities", "City transport", "Transport policy", "Commuting", "Istanbul holidays", "Turkey", "New York", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/28/istanbul-ferries-future-transport-new-york-london", "title": "Istanbul shows ferries have a future", "sentences": ["\u201cIt is an old form of transport that was supplanted by bus, auto and train [but] Sydney, Brisbane, Stockholm, London, New York and Bangkok already have linear urban ferries; Manila, the most dense city on earth, just started a linear urban service on the Passig River; Mumbai is considering coastal service,\u201d she said."]}, {"article": "An emergency international summit called to tackle the migrant boat crisis in the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea, convening in Bangkok on Friday, may prove long on talk and short on answers if countries shy away from coordinated joint action to address the root causes in Burma and Bangladesh, diplomats and aid groups say.

About 3,500 migrants have fled by sea in the past month. Photograph: S. Yulinnas/AP     About 3,500 migrants have fled by sea in the past month, mostly coming ashore in Malaysia and Indonesia or being rescued at sea, often after initially being turned away. Unknown numbers have died, and the UN estimates that up to 2,600 are currently at sea on seven boats, the abandoned victims of people-smuggling gangs.  After fierce international criticism, Malaysia reversed its policy of sending boats back to sea and now says it will accept migrants for up to 12 months. But it is unclear what will happen to them after that. Despite its economy\u2019s reliance on foreign workers, Malaysia complains that it is home to 120,000 illegal migrants from Burma and is already doing its bit.  Indonesia has adopted a similar stance toward the Rohingyas, but is insisting that all Bangladeshi migrants be repatriated. Thailand, whose crackdown on people-smuggling gangs precipitated the crisis last month, is now saying it will provide temporary \u201chumanitarian help\u201d but that it is hosting 100,000 refugees from Burma and does not want any more.

Photograph: Darren Whiteside/REUTERS     So great is its denial of the problem, the Burmese government agreed to attend the summit only if the word Rohingya was not mentioned in the invitation. Predominantly Buddhist Burma maintains that the much repressed and discriminated against 1.3 million-strong Muslim minority concentrated in Rakhine state are not Burmese at all, but rather Bangladeshi immigrants.   Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese opposition leader, has declined to speak up for the Rohingya, an omission that brought criticism this week from the Dalai Lama, the Buddhist leader and a fellow Nobel peace prize winner.   \u201cIt\u2019s very sad. In the Burmese case I hope Aung San Suu Kyi, as a Nobel laureate, can do something,\u201d he told the Australian newspaper. \u201cI met her two times \u2026 I mentioned this problem and she told me she found some difficulties, that things were not simple but very complicated. But in spite of that I feel she can do something.\u201d  Criticism of Burma\u2019s actions provoked counter-protests in Rangoon this week. Banners carried through the streets by nationalists, including Buddhist monks, featured slogans calling the migrants \u201cterrorists\u201d and \u201cbeasts\u201d.

Its prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, said migrants who risked their lives fleeing Bangladesh were \u201cmentally sick\u201d and tainted the country\u2019s image abroad, and she vowed to punish them. Meanwhile, plans were announced to forcibly relocate Rohingya camps.   About one-third of Bangladesh\u2019s 166 million people are under the age of 15. Youth unemployment is around 13%. The economy depends to a significant extent on remittances from more than seven million overseas workers.  The US, which will be represented at the summit, has said it will consider admitting more Rohingyas. But others are unyielding. Asked whether Australia would help with resettlement, the prime minister Tony Abbott replied: \u201cNope, nope, nope \u2026 We are not going to do anything that will encourage people to get on boats.\u201d  Asean countries have another reason for eschewing joint action to pressure Burma: the group\u2019s long-established principle of non-interference in each other\u2019s internal affairs. In an unusual step, Malaysia, Asean\u2019s current chair, sent a delegation to Rangoon last week to discuss the issue.   But diplomats say unless and until Asean acts tough, Burma\u2019s regime will continue to try to ignore the problem. \u201cIt is an Asean issue and has to be resolved by Asean,\u201d a western diplomat said.

In other testimony collected by the Arakan Project, a 19-year-old Rohingya man from Burma\u2019s northern Rakhine state described his journey on one of the boats last year. After nine days at sea on a Burmese cattle ship, his vessel joined with a bigger boat not far from the Thai shore. He estimated there were more than 1,000 people onboard, roughly one-third of whom were women. \u201cI spent 14 days on this ship. Three days after we were transferred, three smugglers arrived from Malaysia and boarded our ship. They carried mobile phones. They first asked who had phone numbers and, one by one, we started calling our relatives. Those [who did not provide] phone numbers were beaten,\u201d he recalled.

The abuses continued until families sent money, after which survivors were taken to shore by small fishing boats.  \u201cBefore I left, I witnessed three men who had become paralysed and one dead body was thrown overboard,\u201d he added.  A survivor from northern Thailand who spoke to the Guardian by phone described similar treatment. \u201cI stayed on the boats for three months from February this year until April.

Just the backdrop of life \u2026 I wake to the sound of the jungle and look out at the sea; there\u2019s space to think. The culture\u2019s amazing. I\u2019ve been reading about the history of Phuket, the tin industry here, the way people used to live inland because they didn\u2019t want to get raided by pirates. Portuguese culture is very strong: you see it in the architecture and the food. People forget that chillies were brought here by Portuguese traders. My next series of paintings celebrates Thailand\u2019s lady boy culture. It\u2019s fascinating and beautiful. These characters just say, here I am and I am what I am, and it\u2019s not even questioned. They\u2019re totally part of the culture \u2013 they belong. It\u2019s not like that in the west. The models are friends of mine and I\u2019m styling them like lady boy meets warrior meets B52 bomber! I could never eat my greens before \u2026 but I do now! The food here is fantastic. Natural Restaurant in Phuket old town is amazing and its fried white snapper is great. Taste on Surin beach is a beautiful place, but the best Italian on the planet is La Gaetana in Phuket town. It\u2019s run by an Italian man who\u2019s been here for about 20 years with his wife and family \u2013 who\u2019d have thought! I DJ a bit at beach parties, but don\u2019t go to many music events here. A few of us went to see my friend Norman (Fatboy Slim) play at a nightclub called Seduction in Patong recently. But I like jazz clubs. One of the best is the Siam Supper Club on Lagoon Road. It\u2019s run by an English fellow. It\u2019s got a smoky, old-style gentlemen\u2019s club feel, good for a cocktail with a beautiful backdrop.     Taste restaurant, Surin Beach    The best nightclub in Thailand is Glow in Bangkok. Anyone passing through, from Skrillex to Fabio to myself, will play there. It\u2019s quite small and dark, with low ceilings, a great sound system and great people. It\u2019s a cool place to be. Thailand is a really beautiful place, culturally and spiritually. You appreciate it the longer you stay. Of course there\u2019s the seedy side: you see it in Patong, the main holiday resort in Phuket, but we don\u2019t venture in.     Soi Rommanee in Phuket Old Town.

There\u2019s nothing on it except one shack selling fish \u2013 but it\u2019s damn good fried fish and seafood! Yoga changed my life and I\u2019m big into it. Bikram [Choudhury, the yoga guru] is a personal friend. I go to two studios in Phuket: Kata studio for hot yoga and Yoga Republic for vinyasa flow. I\u2019ve just launched a clothing brand, Yogangster, and hope to get yoga to young people who can\u2019t afford it.     Banana Beach, Phuket\u2019s best-kept secret.

I\u2019ll stop off at Oh La La to pick up a ficelle (a kind of thin, flat baguette) and eat it at home, listening to a bit of Stan Getz. Then I\u2019ll go to Bikram\u2019s and, following that, to old Phuket to look around the shops before I collect my three-year-old daughter Coco from school. She\u2019s picking up a bit of Thai now, which is amazing. Then I\u2019ll go home. Paint. And be in bed by 9pm.

He said Chelsea felt an even bigger responsibility to achieve their goals just one week after lifting the Premier League title. The team touched down to a raucous reception at Sydney airport on Sunday, leaving captain John Terry a little stunned at the welcome afforded to him and his team-mates. \u201cWe were all pretty tired and when we came through we all lit up,\u201d Terry said. \u201cThe welcome was overwhelming and we got mobbed a little bit but it was nice and we\u2019re delighted to be here.\u201d Terry said Chelsea\u2019s preparation for the match would include watching footage of Sydney FC\u2019s match on Saturday against Tottenham, which Spurs won 1-0 thanks to a Harry Kane goal.

While he returned as a substitute for the last two games, he has not completed a full 90 minutes since Chelsea\u2019s draw with Southampton in mid-March.   Related: Premier League: where the clubs need to strengthen for next season | Guardian writers    Chelsea have been anxious not to aggravate Costa\u2019s problem. He was omitted from the Spain squad for their friendly with Costa Rica and the Euro 2016 qualifier against Belarus later this month after the Spain head coach, Vicente del Bosque, cited concerns over his fitness. Chelsea\u2019s manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, withdrew him as a precaution after a 25-minute cameo in the friendly against Thailand All Stars in Bangkok on Saturday as the striker was deemed \u201ctired\u201d. The club have ruled out surgery and are endeavouring to strengthen Costa\u2019s thigh muscles and increase the elasticity of his hamstring to ensure the same problems do not reoccur next season. Efforts will also be made to ensure he has recovered psychologically from the problem. The 26-year-old split with his girlfriend after swapping Spain for England and has struggled with the language, and reports surfaced in Madrid on Monday that he was unsettled and seeking a return to Atl\u00e9tico. Chelsea, who paid \u00a332m for his services last summer, have dismissed those suggestions and will not countenance any bids for his services. Costa, who has remained publicly upbeat with his team-mates and has trained for Chelsea\u2019s game against Sydney FC on Tuesday, has been deeply frustrated by the succession of niggles, which date back to his time at Atl\u00e9tico where he was forced off early in the European Cup final against Real Madrid last May. He is understandably wary of suffering further relapses. Chelsea are likely to be in regular contact with Atl\u00e9tico this summer as they weigh up a \u00a343m move for the France international forward Antoine Griezmann, a fee which would trigger the buy-out clause in his deal, but also over the potential sale of Filipe Lu\u00eds back to the Spanish club.

Anne Richard, the assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration, said on Wednesday that there had always been a \u201cstrong tradition\u201d of the US, Canada and Australia taking the lead in tackling humanitarian issues. \u201cThat sense that Australia is in the forefront has deteriorated a bit in the last few years,\u201d she said. Richard met Australia\u2019s ambassador for people smuggling issues, Andrew Goledzinowski, during an emergency international summit on the plight of thousands of Burmese and Bangladeshi caught in an asylum seeker standoff in the Andaman sea. Richard was evasive on whether Australia\u2019s policy to turn back asylum boats had, at least in part, contributed to the standoff.   Related: Asian refugee crisis: trafficked migrants held off Thailand in vast 'camp boats'    \u201cThe US takes a different approach,\u201d she said, pointing to the policy of assessing protection claims on-board the vessels in which asylum seekers flee.

About 2,000 Rohingya and Bangladeshi migrants are still stranded at sea somewhere between Burma and Malaysia, Thomas Vargas, from the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR) in Indonesia, said. \u201cThe first priority must be saving their lives,\u201d he said. Thousands of people were abandoned at sea after Thailand cracked down on a well-established people smuggling route in May. Two of Thailand\u2019s neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, refused to take those stranded at first, but eventually agreed to temporarily house them for 12 months. There are already 1,000 Rohingya asylum seekers in Aceh and north Sumatra, of whom a third are unaccompanied minors. Another 800 Bangladeshi asylum seekers are being housed in the region. \u201cWhat we want is for people to feel safe in their own countries, and if they\u2019re not, then we want them to be resettled nearby,\u201d Richard said. \u201cIn [the Asia-Pacific] region I don\u2019t think any country should think they are an innocent bystander.\u201d Vargas added that resettlement is \u201ca very important protection tool\u201d. The US has a long-standing program to resettle Burmese refugees, many of whom are Rohingya. It took about 1,000 Burmese refugees in the past three months, making Burma one of the top three countries of origin for the US refugee program. Shortly after the high seas standoff made headlines, the US stepped in with an offer to resettle some of the people fleeing their homelands. The Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, has refused to resettle any of the stranded Rohingya, even if they are found to be refugees.  \u201cAustralia will do absolutely nothing that gives any encouragement to anyone to think that they can get on a boat, that they can work with people smugglers to start a new life,\u201d Abbott said last month.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry.

That same year, Krull published a groundbreaking photography book, M\u00e9tal, in which she helped create a modernist visual poetry through her striking images of steel structures, including the Eiffel Tower, shot from below and filling the frame with its suddenly unfamiliar geometry. In Martin Parr and Gerry Badger\u2019s authoritative The Photobook Vol.1, it is described as \u201cthe finest example of a modernist photobook in the dynamic, cinematic mode\u201d from a photographer \u201cat the forefront of radical modernism\u201d. More than that, Krull was one of the first photographers to treat the photobook as an artistic end in itself, an object as self-contained and expressive as an exhibition. Since then, Krull\u2019s reputation has faded somewhat, at least in comparison to more celebrated male contemporaries like Man Ray and Moholy-Nagy, but a fascinating exhibition, Germaine Krull (1897\u20131985): a Photographers Journey, which has just opened at Jeu de Paume in Paris, her adopted city, should go some way to restoring her to her rightful position as a pioneering photographer as well as a radical free spirit. If 1928 was a pivotal year for Krull, she had already lived a colourful and \u2013 even by the bohemian standards of the time \u2013 liberated life by then. Born in Wilda-Pozna\u0144, East Prussia, in 1897, she had a nomadic childhood, her father, an engineer, uprooting the family to Bosnia, Paris, Slovenia and rural Bavaria, before they eventually settled in 1912 in Munich, where her mother ran a boarding house.     Self-portrait, Paris, 1927. Estate Germaine Krull Photograph: Estate Germaine Krull    In 1917, having completed a photography studies course, she became part of a group of Munich-based artists and writers that included the political thinker, Kurt Eisner, soon to become prime minister of the Free State of Bavaria. An early series of images of female nudes, Der At, was published in a book of photogravures in 1918, but her fledgling career as a photographer was dramatically interrupted by the assassination of Eisner in early 1919. Krull\u2019s political activism led to her being banned from Munich by the authorities and on a visit to Russia in 1921 she was arrested by the secret police. Accused of being an enemy of Leninism, she was imprisoned on two separate occasions, and, at one point, subjected to a fake execution that left her traumatised for the rest of her life. She was expelled from Russia in 1922, by which point she was so ill that her hair fell out. When she made it back to Berlin, she found employment as a manager of a photographic studio. There, she worked on several more series of nude studies, including one with a lesbian subtext and another, Friends, that is unashamedly erotic, as well as some striking self portraits.  In 1926, Krull settled in Paris, where she embraced fashion photography, working for a while for the great fabric designer Sonia Delaunay with whom she also photographed more formal portraits and shot an edgily glamorous advertising campaign for the couturier Paul Poiret. Her artistic breakthrough began in 1928, when she was hired by the nascent VU magazine and the Salon de L\u2019escalier show followed soon afterwards. From 1928 until 1931, the years covered by the new Jeu de Paume exhibition, Krull was at the peak of her creativity, her work appearing frequently in VU and the Surrealist-influenced Belgian magazine, Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s. She shot the ordinary people of Paris in markets, bistros and on the streets, as well as chronicling the city\u2019s bohemian milieu, befriending and photographing the likes of Colette, Jean Cocteau and Andr\u00e9 Malraux. Other photobooks followed, including 100 x Paris (1929), Etudes de Nu and Le Valois (both 1930). In 1931, alongside the writer George Simenon she published the first photo-novel, Le Folle d\u2019Itteville.     Nudes, 1924 Photograph: Estate Germaine Krull    Krull\u2019s extraordinary life continued apace throughout the 1930s and 1940s, the strength of her leftwing convictions and her restlessness unabated. She joined the Free French in 1941, both as an active member of the resistance and a photographer. After the war, she travelled to South East Asia, where, following in her mother\u2019s footsteps, she became director of the soon-to-be-renowned Oriental Hotel in Bangkok. A sojourn in India followed, during which she lived among an exiled Tibetan community near Dehradun and became a buddhist. All the while she continued to photograph, chronicling the societies in which she lived \u2013 Monte Carlo, Brazil, Southeast Asia and India \u2013 in books such as Ballets de Monte Carlo (1937) and Tibetans in India (1968).  From her erotic nudes to her modernist visual studies, and through her myriad careers as a portraitist, fashion photographer and photojournalist, Germaine Krull followed her instincts and kept moving, ever restless, ever curious and relentlessly inventive. If the exhibition at Jeu de Paume only reflects a part of her journey, it is undoubtedly the most creatively fertile part, and, as such, serves as a long overdue celebration of a great artist who lived an independent life to the full.", "publicationDate": "2015-06-04T17:29:14Z", "tags": ["Art and design", "Modernism", "Culture", "Photography"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jun/04/germaine-krull-man-ray-named-equal", "title": "Germaine Krull: the woman Man Ray named his equal", "sentences": ["After the war, she travelled to South East Asia, where, following in her mother\u2019s footsteps, she became director of the soon-to-be-renowned Oriental Hotel in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Could the key to sustainable business be changing corporate mindsets from a culture of \u201cmore\u201d \u2013 more revenue, more profit, more market share \u2013 to one of \u201cenough\u201d? Bangkok-based brand strategist Sirikul Laukaikul argued that\u2019s the case in a presentation about an idea called the \u201csufficiency economy philosophy\u201d at Sustainable Brands in San Diego, California, this week. The idea is for businesses and individuals to do what they can to make sure that everyone on the planet has enough of what they need \u2013 and to be happy with having enough resources, instead of taking more than they need, she said. \u201cMost marketing based on just one word: more,\u201d she said. She showed a slide titled \u201cbad karma\u201d. \u201cWhen we try to create more and more and more all the time, that we call greed. Anything beyond your needs is greed.\u201d Greed ultimately leads to dissatisfaction, anger, ignorance and foolish behavior, while marketing that focuses on sharing instead of on greed can lead to kindness, satisfaction and good behavior, Laukaikul claimed. Essentially, the philosophy is about not taking more resources than you need so that everyone will have enough. Laukaikul described it as \u201ca mindset to move everyone to go beyond profit so that everyone will have enough.\u201d To accomplish this, she advocates what she calls \u201ckarma marketing\u201d. \u201cEveryone will have enough if everyone understands the concept of moderation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to use marketing to create responsible and mindful behavior.\u201d This doesn\u2019t mean companies shouldn\u2019t make a profit, but should extend their missions to making sure that they and everyone else have enough resources now and in the future, she added. \u201cStart with yourself \u2013 have enough for yourself first \u2013 but don\u2019t stay there forever. Extend it to others \u2013 make it enough for others \u2013 and be moderate on taking, but be generous on giving. That\u2019s the whole idea of the sufficiency economy. Just say \u2018I have enough\u2019.\u201d It was an unusual sort of talk to bring to a business conference. What did business leaders think?  \u201cI realized there\u2019s so much I don\u2019t know about other cultures that are relevant to the things I do,\u201d said Ricardo Caceres, marketing director of sustainability at Coca-Cola. \u201cThe idea of self-awareness, the personal perspective to know when you have enough, is something I can relate to as a person, but also as a brand. I really like that; there\u2019s something very simple and practical about it.\u201d Raphael Bemporad, chief strategy officer at brand consultancy BBMG, said he thinks the idea of adapting principles that have been in the human conversation for millennia and embedding them into business is a fair one. \u201cThe question is how the intangible becomes tangible,\u201d he said. That said, he believes the fundamental law of karma applies not only to humans, but also to companies, he added. \u201cThe keys to good karma, such as the sharing economy and the circular economy, are in our economy already, and now we have an opportunity to use them,\u201d he said. \u201cIn general, branding like a Buddhist is a great opportunity.\u201d Meanwhile, Lori Duvall, global director of green social innovation at online marketplace eBay, called the presentation \u201cnovel\u201d and said it\u2019s always important for people to explore the margins. \u201cAs much as marketing is considered creative, in reality creative people are really limited in what they can consider because of brands,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to let them be wacky and consider: what if things were really really different? It\u2019s good to have a few \u2018out there\u2019 things for people to think about.\u201d It\u2019s also good for people who have been practicing corporate sustainability for a while to be exposed to different stuff, she added. \u201cThere\u2019s a really positive vibe of learning here \u2013 everyone\u2019s all jazzed up \u2013 so that\u2019s really energizing.

Denmark   Denmark and Sweden combined have now had at least four restaurants in the best 50 every year since 2012, clearly reflecting that the hype around Nordic cuisine is not a temporary fad. Italy only has three of its restaurants in the list this year, but its highest placed entry, Osteria Francescana, is up into second place, leapfrogging Noma. The Modena restaurant has made the top six every year since 2010.     Italy   Australia has not had a restaurant in the top 10 since 2008 when Sydney-based Tetsuya\u2019s managed the feat.

He\u2019d first come to east Asia on contract for an international church whose missionaries kept getting into trouble. He never went home: there was more than enough work. \u201cSpecifically,\u201d he said, \u201cwith people like you. Middle-aged, middle-class Brits who went to your crazy private schools may just about be the most damaged social sub-group I\u2019ve ever come across.\u201d It\u2019s long been known that the practice of sending young children off\u00a0into the care of strangers is not wholly safe. The ancient \u201cpublic\u201d schools worried the Victorians as much\u00a0or more than did the workhouses: three parliamentary commissions sat in the 19th century to\u00a0look at the financial frauds, riots and\u00a0the astonishing numbers of deaths\u00a0\u2013 from suicides, assaults by teachers and pupils, starvation, epidemics \u2013 in the schools of the rich. Tom Brown\u2019s Schooldays only scraped the surface.   Related: Does boarding school really help disadvantaged students?    In the 20th century a clutch of authors, from George Orwell to Roald Dahl, wrote in their different ways about the systemic cruelty, psychological and physical, and of its wider effects. One of those was the establishment of the principle, among\u00a0the\u00a0elite and the ordinary, that\u00a0to have been brutalised at a boarding school was key to becoming the right sort of Briton \u2013 one that might\u00a0run an empire or a corporation, or a cricket team. Naturally, as the proven best way to educate a ruling caste, the system spread across the English-speaking world. Psychology seems to have taken a long time to catch up with the issue, perhaps because Freud famously dismissed most of his child patients\u2019 allegations of abuse by adults as fantasy. Given the importance the boarding-school class had and still has in running modern Britain \u2013 from the City to Westminster, not forgetting the BBC \u2013 that seems to have been an omission. Joy Schaverien coined the term \u201cboarding school syndrome\u201d only a decade ago, though she follows in the footsteps of Nick Duffell, a psychotherapist who started work in the field in 1990 and wrote a passionate and influential book about the wounds boarding can inflict, The Making of Them.   Related: Kathryn Hughes finds that Tom Brown's Schooldays is not the jolly romp most of us remember    Duffell is himself a \u201cboarding school survivor\u201d \u2013 his own term \u2013 and that inevitably fuels his work. But Schaverien, a Jungian psychoanalyst, did not go to boarding school: it was as a practitioner that she became intrigued, noting how often boarding school featured in the past of surprising numbers of her patients. That makes her book \u2013 an academic work, academically priced, though a gripping read \u2013 all the more important. There\u2019s a confused debate going on about private boarding schools, with arguments about class and unfair privilege mixed up with a bewildering range of notions about children\u2019s emotional health. Schaverien brings a clear eye and the experience of 25 years of collecting data to an issue that should concern everyone worried about how children fare in professional care \u2013 which, of course, is what boarding school is. She\u2019s not impartial. In Britain, you don\u2019t have to have gone to a private boarding school to be affected by them and their product. Schaverien\u2019s experience comes from her father, who, in old age, told his family how he still ached at memories of being left at his boarding school in Brighton, in 1916, aged six. The fact that he arrived\u00a0in short trousers and wearing a velour hat with elastic under\u00a0the chin ensured that he was savagely bullied from the first minute. \u201cIf I was so precious that mother dressed me this way, why then\u00a0did she\u00a0part with me?\u201d he\u00a0was still wondering, 70 years later. That\u2019s by no means the most upsetting story to be found in Schaverien\u2019s awful case studies. But it does go to the heart of the issue, both for angry ex-boarders, their spouses and children and anyone bemused by the system. I\u2019ve talked and corresponded with all of those since I started writing\u00a0for this newspaper about sexual abuse and bullying in British boarding schools, state and private. The many hundreds of emails I\u2019ve received make it pretty clear that the schools of the elite suffered the same cover-ups and the same astonishing failings in regulation and in policing as did the hospitals, care homes and young offenders\u2019 prisons. The difference? As several correspondents put it, in anger or amusement, \u201cPosh people\u2019s parents paid to have them abused.\u201d That, of course, is what most hurt Hymie Schaverien, and thousands of others. \u201cBoarders cannot console themselves with the thought that their parents did not want them to go,\u201d Professor Schaverien states. Their parents chose to send them from home into hell or prison \u2013 words her patients frequently use \u2013 and so to break the bond with their child. Attachment \u2013 the crucial establishment of trust and security through a primary carer \u2013 is the basis of modern child development psychology. Boarding schools could not have broken or redirected healthy attachment more effectively, as Schaverien illustrates. From the moment the parent drove away, a child had to adjust to the fact that not only was privacy and safety no longer guaranteed \u2013 let alone the consolation of a hug \u2013 but that their parents had chosen this future. John Bowlby, the psychologist famous for first coming up with attachment theory in the 1960s, described public school as part of \u201cthe time-honoured barbarism required to produce English gentlemen\u201d. Bowlby boarded at 13: he was against it. Schaverien has, of course, accounts of children who enjoyed boarding school: though some patients inform her that that was because home life was so deficient in love or structure that the necessary attachments were better made at school. It\u2019s hard not to conclude that boarding schools were meant to do this job: replace infantile loyalties to mummy with the bonds that tie you to the team. It worked: but the side-effects of this abrupt intervention in a six- or eight-year-old\u2019s development could be savage. Symptoms that a therapist in boarding school syndrome addresses are problems with anger, depression, anxiety, failure to sustain relationships, fear of abandonment, substance abuse and so forth. A common effect is amnesia: many of Schaverien\u2019s patients \u2013 and my correspondents \u2013 have sad gaps where, in a normal childhood and adolescence, there would be a wealth of memory. Forgetting the pain is yet another coping mechanism. In a fascinating account of four years\u2019 analysis with one deeply traumatised patient, Theo, Schaverien takes us to the point where she believes boarding school syndrome is born. On the way we see Theo \u2013 often using drawings \u2013 recover memories of awful injustice. That is a key issue for many boarders \u2013 children, she says, have an ethical sensibility from an early age and it is traumatic when something \u2013 like brutality on the part of an adult \u2013 violates it. Trauma affects the normal development of a child\u2019s brain. Eventually, and in Theo\u2019s case this happened dramatically, a traumatised child, exhausted by perpetual fear, may be forced for their own survival to separate their selves \u2013 the normal, vulnerable home self, and the boarding-school self. That\u2019s the syndrome, and though sceptics of Jungian theory may be dubious, my correspondence has many people who talk unhappily of the child they left behind at the school, their other self who was never able to grow up. It\u2019s a profound effect, an \u201cencapsulation of self\u2026 that may last a lifetime\u201d, Schaverien says. It\u2019s obvious enough that these institutions, full of emotionally needy and incompetently supervised children, have provided havens and hunting grounds for sexual criminals since their beginning. Hence the extraordinary wave of allegations about historic child abuse in institutions. Schaverien devotes an interesting chapter to sexual abuse but, for her, it is not the main issue. Theo never experienced sexual abuse. It grabs the headlines, but I suspect that for those who want truly to protect and succour healthy children, the shocking revelations about paedophiles in institutions may be a distraction. Again, while my correspondence contains many awful allegations, it\u2019s also full of people apologising for not having a story of sexual predation to tell. \u201cIt was only bullying,\u201d people write, \u201cnot what you\u2019d call abuse.\u201d But emotional cruelty is what exacts the greatest toll on the developing mind. Children are resilient, they can recover from physical hurt: it\u2019s clear from reading Schaverien that what most reliably damages children is long-term emotional neglect, the absence of safety, the failure of justice, the loss of love. We need the psychological abuse of children to be properly outlawed \u2013 a long-awaited \u201cCinderella law\u201d came into force last month, but it is weak \u2013 and we need to ask the rich and aspirational to think again before they put their children into care. They should read this book: it could save them a lot of money.   Boarding School Syndrome is published by Routledge (\u00a327.99).

Related: Any payments to people smugglers 'may have broken Australian law'    The Australian government is refusing to confirm or deny allegations that US$30,000 ($39,000) was paid to six people smugglers who were intercepted at sea to return asylum seekers to Indonesia in May. Indonesia\u2019s vice president, Jusuf Kalla, was quoted as saying Australia would be acting like a smuggler if the allegations proved to be correct. \u201cIt was bribing, right?\u201d he told reporters in Jakarta on Monday, as quoted by local website detik.com. \u201cPeople who bribe, that is already wrong ... Wow, a state bribing, that certainly doesn\u2019t fit with the correct ethics in state relations.\u201d Bishop joined the prime minister, Tony Abbott, and immigration minister, Peter Dutton, in refusing to rule out the practice when asked directly in question time in Canberra on Monday. Legal experts said the payments could be in breach of Australian domestic laws relating to people smuggling. Bishop sparked renewed diplomatic tension on Monday by saying that Australia\u2019s hardline operation to turn back asylum-seeker boats was necessary \u201cbecause Indonesian boats with Indonesian crews are leaving Indonesia with the express intention of breaching our sovereignty\u201d. She urged Indonesia \u201cto enforce sovereignty over its borders\u201d. Agus Barnas, a spokesman for Indonesia\u2019s security ministry, said Bishop\u2019s comment was \u201cnot an appropriate statement for her to make [and] she should withdraw it\u201d. \u201cHer accusation is only going to further complicate the Indonesia-Australia bilateral relations and our cooperation to tackle the boat-people issue,\u201d Barnas told the Guardian. \u201cPlease do not muddy the waters even further ... Australia should go back to the UN process and uphold its responsibility under the refugee convention.\u201d   Related: Australia and people-smuggler payment claims: what we know so far    Barnas issued a pointed warning to the Australian government about the consequences of paying crews of boats to return to Indonesia. \u201cIf the allegation that Australia paid people smugglers is proven true, it will encourage more people smugglers to go there. This is very regrettable,\u201d Barnas said. \u201cIndonesia has done all it can on this issue. If we have not prevented the boats to go there, there would have been an influx of thousands of migrants to Australia.\u201d Indonesia had already launched an investigation into allegations that an Australian official paid US$5,000 each to the captain and five crew members of an intercepted boat carrying about 65 asylum seekers from Bangladesh, Burma and Sri Lanka, apparently en route to New Zealand.   The UNHCR said migrants rescued off Indonesia last month told the agency that payments were allegedly made to people smugglers. \u201cOur team in Indonesia has interviewed passengers who say that while at sea the Indonesian crew was taken by the Australian authorities to another boat for a few hours and returned to the original boat talking about payment,\u201d UNHCR\u2019s Bangkok-based regional spokeswoman Vivian Tan said. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of such allegations in the past,\u201d she added. Over the weekend, the Indonesian foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, ordered an explanation from the Australian ambassador, Paul Grigson, about the allegations. Grigson had returned to Jakarta only days earlier, having been recalled to Canberra in protest at Indonesia\u2019s execution of two Australians for drug-smuggling offences. In parliament in Canberra on Monday, Bishop and Dutton did not repeat their previous firm denials that payments had occurred, instead invoking the government\u2019s policy of not commenting on operational matters to avoid answering direct questions. Abbott, too, refused to rule out the practice. The prime minister said the government did \u201cnot feel the need to broadcast our intentions and our tactics to our enemies\u201d or to \u201cbig-note itself in public, if the only beneficiaries are our enemies\u201d. \u201cThe only thing that really counts is that this government has stopped the boats and we have done so in a way which is consistent with our position as a decent and humane country because the most decent and humane thing you can do is stop the boats which is exactly what we have done,\u201d he told the House of Representatives.

Phillip Boulten SC, a leading Sydney barrister, and Nicholas Cowdery, a former director of public prosecutions in New South Wales, told Guardian Australia that an Australian paying people smugglers would likely be in breach of the provisions of the criminal code outlawing people smuggling or assisting people smuggling. But both pointed to the fact that the government itself would have to initiate and investigate any charges. \u201cOn the face of it someone who pays thousands of dollars to an Indonesian mariner to take refugees back to Indonesia so as to breach Indonesian laws of entry may be breaching the criminal code,\u201d Boulten said \u2013 including section 73(1), which makes people smuggling an offence, 73(3) dealing with aggravated people smuggling or 73.3A (supporting the offence of people smuggling).

But people like Pieter Levels are not your average traveller. A Dutch website developer, Levels has been living and working nomadically in places like Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Manila and Taipei for two years. With just a carry-on backpack, he chooses his location at will, based on a variety of factors \u2013 Wi-Fi speed, average temperature, exotic food and cost of living \u2013 that have little bearing on the work he actually does. Somewhere in his nomadic journey, Levels noticed that there was a burgeoning need to create an online infrastructure for people like himself. That\u2019s when he created #nomads, a membership-based chat system which runs on the team communication platform known as Slack. The channel allows users to ask people in their current city the types of practical or mundane questions that a tourist would unlikely need to ask.      Pieter Levels is the founder of Nomad List, which ranks nomad-friendly cities    Members of the geographically dispersed subculture that Levels is a part of call themselves \u201cdigital nomads\u201d. They are borderless, mostly self-employed remote workers who interact with cities in a way that\u2019s entirely different from a tourist, but still doesn\u2019t quite reach the status of resident. A relatively new phenomenon, there are no hard statistics on the prevalence of digital nomads or location independent workers. But thanks to the growing prevalence of freelance livelihoods, a global sharing economy and myriad of digital tools, the number of people who are able to live this life is growing quickly. And in a rapidly urbanising world, where a major city in Asia increasingly offers the same amenities as one in Europe, many people are reaching the realisation they don\u2019t need to stay in one place.    Saying you\u2019re a 'citizen of the world' is a super cliche right? But it\u2019s becoming quite true       In addition to his chat channel, Levels has built other nomad-focused web products like Nomad List, which ranks the best cities for remote workers, and remote | OK, which serves as a database of remote-friendly jobs. He says he \u201cbuilt Nomad List to propel the movement of people working and traveling in different places and to show them it\u2019s possible\u201d. So how does a nomad differ from a tourist or resident? In many ways, Levels says, you can think of a digital nomad like a \u201cshort-term independent expat\u201d. Unlike a resident expat, they don\u2019t work for a large multinational company in an air conditioned office building and they generally enter a country on tourists visas, simply renewing or moving on when it expires. But unlike a tourist, they don\u2019t arrive in a foreign city without any responsibilities. Travel isn\u2019t necessarily required for them to do their jobs, but neither is staying in one place.  A browse on Levels\u2019 Nomad List reveals that, in addition to the expected low-cost nomad hubs in cities like Bangkok, Ubud, and Ho Chi Minh City, oft-overlooked American cities including Nashville, Las Vegas and West Palm Beach are also well suited to nomads thanks to lower costs of living than New York or London. The decision to not maintain a permanent address while they travel \u2013 and for many, opt out of the property ladder or notion of ownership entirely \u2013 is what allows most nomads to afford a lifestyle of perpetual travel.      Janet Brent, an ebook designer, says her travel decisions are based on what makes sense financially    Janet Brent is an independent ebook designer. She says many people she knows assume she travels for work, but in reality her international destinations are largely up to her, and driven by cost. \u201cContrary to what some people might think, I don\u2019t get paid to travel \u2013 I simply choose the lifestyle. Rather than rent in one given city, I choose to travel and do short-term, temporary stays around the world and my travel decisions are literally based on what makes the most sense financially for me,\u201d Brent said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely different from vacationing \u2013 you really sink into the city life and get your feet wet in the communities.\u201d Bryce Adams is another such nomad. He works as a developer for a South African company WooThemes, which has a workforce that\u2019s more than 80% remote-based. Though Adams frequently posts pictures on Instagram of his enviable culinary adventures from Seoul to Bangkok, he says nomad life in foreign cities has its downsides, including finding adequate Wi-Fi for the bandwidth-hungry work his livelihood depends on. Contrary to the perception that he works under a mango tree in a tropical oasis, Adams says the reality of this life means that he often ends up veering towards more western style places in globalised cities \u2013 ones that are sure to have air conditioning and a decent connection \u2013 rather than exotic outposts or beachfront cafes. \u201cA fellow nomad made quite a funny but honest tweet a few days ago that stuck with me: \u201cIt\u2019s funny that digital nomads spend 16 hours to fly to the other side of the world to sit in Starbucks\u201d, and it\u2019s completely true,\u201d Adams said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a digital nomad, you don\u2019t actually have as much freedom as most people think you do. We have deadlines, we all have people relying on us and a mouth (or two) that needs to be fed. It\u2019s nice to be able to work anywhere in the world but it\u2019s not without it\u2019s challenges.\u201d     Bryce Adams is based in Asia and works for a South African company. He\u2019s originally from Australia    But these challenges can often provide an opportunity for nomads to see a side of a city they may not have if they were staying in a luxury hotel for a long weekend. However inconvenient, a trip to a local doctor, immigration office or laundromat \u2013 or a conflict with a local Airbnb host (the accommodation style of choice for most nomads) \u2013 can be far more culturally instructive than a trip to the national museum. And because nomads often have to stay where the strongest internet connection is, they tend to spend more time in developing cities compared to the average tourist, who often decamp to more touristy destinations soon after landing at the airport. Karin Christen is a designer and co-founder of Zurich-based web agency required+. She blogs frequently on Medium about the logistics and minutiae of nomad life, from packing and productivity to the specifics of time-zone management. She says the digital nomad working life means that the concept of \u201coffice hours\u201d is out the window; the fact that you\u2019re in another time zone by choice shouldn\u2019t negatively affect your work from your boss\u2019, client\u2019s, or colleague\u2019s point of view. She says finding that balance of work and play when you\u2019re surrounded by an exciting new city requires discipline. \u201cAs a tourist it\u2019s simple, you spend all day exploring where you are, free to explore your new environment, while as a citizen you are already used to your surroundings and the daily routine takes over,\u201d Christen said. \u201cOn the other hand as a quasi-resident you initially burn a lot of time and energy to explore your new surroundings and finding great Wi-Fi, places to eat and shop for groceries. Those new experiences are super fun for me, but very exhausting at the same time.\u201d     Karin Christen says nomad life is fun but exhausting    The nomad life is, by all accounts, one built out of privilege. You not only need a relatively powerful passport that makes tourist visas seamless to attain, but also a knowledge economy job and access to the technology and devices that make remote working possible. But nomads like Adams and Christen say that while they are aware of this privilege, they believe living this way elevates what they\u2019re able to offer, by giving them a broader perspective on what they\u2019re building, writing, or designing and expanding their world view. \u201cBeing able to travel and get around makes it easy to stay inspired,\u201d Christen said. \u201cI truly believe that it makes me a better designer and a more sensible human being, as I tend to see and appreciate the creative solutions people come up with in other parts of the world, even though many tend to have far more constraints than we have at home.\u201d So when you\u2019re constantly on the road and don\u2019t own any property or have a fixed address, which city do you call home? It\u2019s no surprise that many nomads are dual citizens or \u201cthird culture kids,\u201d who have grown up with a notion of identity that\u2019s not tied to nationalism or staying in one place. Levels says that the nomad life has not only changed his notions of citizenship, but the people he chooses to spend time with as well. \u201cSaying you\u2019re a \u2018citizen of the world\u2019 is a super cliche right? But it\u2019s becoming quite true,\u201d Levels said. \u201cThis global awareness has been the reason I started Nomad List and it\u2019s affected who my friends are. It\u2019s normal to have dinner now and sit with a Korean girl, a British-Singaporean guy, a Mexican girl and a Nigerian guy. As much as that sounds like a politically correct TV advertisement, it\u2019s great that that\u2019s the time we\u2019re in now.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2015-06-16T10:53:16Z", "tags": ["Cities", "Internet", "Technology", "Coffee", "Media", "Digital media", "Life and style", "Travel", "Food & drink"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/16/digital-nomads-travel-world-search-fast-wi-fi", "title": "Meet the 'digital nomads' who travel the world in search of fast Wi-Fi", "sentences": ["When the average traveller lands in a city like Bangkok, Berlin, or Buenos Aires, their first step might be to drop their bags at their hotel and to log on to TripAdvisor to find out the hours of a popular tourist attraction or the best rooftop bar for happy hour.", "A browse on Levels\u2019 Nomad List reveals that, in addition to the expected low-cost nomad hubs in cities like Bangkok, Ubud, and Ho Chi Minh City, oft-overlooked American cities including Nashville, Las Vegas and West Palm Beach are also well suited to nomads thanks to lower costs of living than New York or London.", "Though Adams frequently posts pictures on Instagram of his enviable culinary adventures from Seoul to Bangkok, he says nomad life in foreign cities has its downsides, including finding adequate Wi-Fi for the bandwidth-hungry work his livelihood depends on."]}, {"article": "A series of raids conducted across Asia, Africa and Europe resulted in more than 300 arrests and over 600 seizures of assorted wildlife contraband \u2014 from several tons of ivory and rhino horns to whale ribs and sea horses, authorities said on Thursday.

No children play cricket, wrestle or run. Even when evening comes and the searing Indian summer temperatures subside, they will remain with their marbles or toys indoors in this poor Delhi neighbourhood. Basona Bhadra, 26, watches her eight-year-old son, Varu, pour water from one cup to another on her kitchen floor. \u201cHe gets breathless and ill,\u201d she says. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like going out any more. He is happier at home.\u201d Bhadra and her family moved from the city of Meerut, 50 miles away, to Anand Vihar, in the east of the Indian capital, four months ago. She blames the heat for the hacking cough that made her child abandon the energetic games he used to enjoy. Local doctors disagree. Abhinav Agarwal, a paediatrician in nearby Vaishali, says around a third of his patients suffer chronic respiratory ailments \u2013 a consequence, he says, of Delhi\u2019s appalling pollution. Agarwal\u2019s conclusions are backed by data. A survey released last year by the World Health Organisation found that Delhi was the most polluted city in the world, with an annual average of 153 micrograms of the most dangerous small particulates, known as PM2.5s, per cubic metre.   Related: India air pollution 'cutting crop yields by almost half'    The level was six times the WHO\u2019s recommended maximum, 12 times US standards and more than twice the level considered safe even by Indian authorities. During winter, when lower temperatures and fires intensify the pollution, concentrations of PM2.5s routinely spike much higher, regularly reaching levels described by experts as hazardous for humans. The worst hit among Agarwal\u2019s patients are children, particularly those aged between two and seven. \u201cThey are the most vulnerable. It\u2019s been bad for years now. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s getting worse, or not. It\u2019s definitely not getting better,\u201d he says. There are now fears that millions of children in India will suffer serious health problems later in life. \u201cIf you look at lung function in children [here], there is significant decline with constant exposure. This will probably be irreversible. For adults, there is also a more rapid decline than usual with age. Some suggest it is the equivalent of smoking around 10 cigarettes per day. There is also a higher chance of developing coronary and arterial disease,\u201d says Dr Guleria, a lung specialist at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.   Related: India court slams Delhi's worsening air pollution    The WHO found that India has the world\u2019s highest rate of death from respiratory disease, with 159 per 100,000 in 2012, about 10 times that of Italy, five times that of the UK and twice that of China. One study found that half of Delhi\u2019s 4.4 million schoolchildren would never recover full lung capacity. Much depends on levels of exposure, which means that children, who in India often cycle or walk to school along busy roads, receive extremely high doses of toxic chemicals and damaging particulates. Daily levels in schools are four times worse than those that are supposed to trigger alerts in London. In Anand Vihar, the factors that cause pollution across Delhi are particularly severe. There is heavy traffic, swollen by often badly maintained and old trucks and buses; huge landfill rubbish dumps which are sometimes set on fire; filthy industries just a few miles from the city; two coal-fired power stations; nearby intensive construction which generates choking clouds of dust; and, seasonally, smoke from crop burning in fields from farmland in neighbouring states. Another blackspot in Delhi is Munirka, in the south of the city and close to two heavily congested ring roads. Meenu Singh, a Munirka resident whose eight-year-old son has severe asthma which doctors blame on pollution, says she would leave the city if she could.     Smog envelops buildings on the outskirts o Delhi. Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images    \u201cI\u2019m really worried about my child\u2019s health. I don\u2019t want him to be in Delhi, but we have no choice at the moment. He is missing exams and school so his education is suffering. We would hope to one day send him to boarding school and even abroad so that he can live an healthy life,\u201d she says. Many expatriate workers have already left the city, with some major international companies now preferring to base executives in Dubai or Bangkok. Classes at international schools in the city have been cut as numbers dwindle. Delhi saw significant improvement in its air quality a decade ago following a slew of measures including converting buses and autorickshaws to run on gas, moving small industries to zones on the outskirts of the city and raising emission standards. But benefits were swiftly lost.   Related: Why an opinion article on Delhi's air pollution upset many Indians | Janaki Lenin    \u201cWe could not keep the momentum. Now there is a new challenge, and it is much more complicated,\u201d says Anumita Choudhury of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a Delhi thinktank. Choudhury says the problem is a \u201cmobility crisis\u201d in Delhi as use of private vehicles has soared while public transport has suffered chronic under-investment. Between 1991 and 2011, the population of Delhi and its adjoining cities more than doubled to 22 million while the number of registered cars and motorbikes increased fivefold to around 8m. \u201cWe love our cars these days and middle class families have two, three, four of them,\u201d says Surender Sharma, a retired senior air force officer in Delhi who moved to the top floor of a high rise block on the city\u2019s outskirts three years ago to escape air pollution. Environmentalists say between 40% and 50% of the dangerous PM2.5 particulates in Delhi are caused by vehicles. The figures have been challenged by the car industry. One major problem, all admit, is the 70,000 trucks which drive through the city every night on long-distance journeys. A plan to build a bypass has been repeatedly delayed. A new metro has barely made an impact, experts say, as almost all those who use it were previously using buses or bicycles, not cars.     Police officers wear masks as they control traffic in Delhi. Photograph: Altaf Qadri/AP    After being ignored by the media and politicians for many years, the problem of toxic air is now becoming a significant domestic issue with newspapers highlighting the problem. \u201cClean air is a human right,\u201d Prakash Javadekar, the environment minister, said earlier this year. The Bharatiya Janata party government won a landslide victory at an election last year. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, campaigned on a promise of boosting India\u2019s flagging growth. It has been unclear how he intends to reconcile economic development with protection of India\u2019s forests and rivers and an improvement in air quality. Conflicts between local and national governments, and between agencies, have also hampered efforts. The result is that no significant policies beyond a national air monitoring index have yet been announced, while many measures introduced elsewhere, such as closing schools during spikes of pollution or forcing old vehicles off the road, have been rejected.   Related: 'My children are suffering but what can I do?' Delhi's polluted air, by the people who live there    \u201cOnly 14% of individual journeys in Delhi are made in private vehicles. It is a small minority who are determining policy in this city so the majority voice has to come out louder to determine travel and investment choices,\u201d says Choudhury, of the CSE. The problem is not restricted to the capital. According to the WHO, 13 of the dirtiest 20 cities in the world are in India. Medical experts fear a failure to act rapidly could be costly in the long run. \u201cWe have a very young population currently being exposed [to severe pollution] and they will have very significant health problems in 15 to 20 years\u2019 time. We are just looking at this in terms of short-term economic growth. The health cost has been forgotten,\u201d says Guleria, the lung specialist.", "publicationDate": "2015-06-24T06:54:55Z", "tags": ["Environment", "India", "Pollution", "World Health Organisation", "Health", "Children", "Delhi", "Society", "South and Central Asia", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/24/indian-children-fall-victim-to-delhis-appalling-pollution", "title": "Child health fears at the most polluted spot in the world's most polluted city", "sentences": ["Many expatriate workers have already left the city, with some major international companies now preferring to base executives in Dubai or Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Louis Vuitton brought a little bit of a Glastonbury line up to the spring/summer 2016 menswear collections at Paris fashion week. Nile Rodgers, the Chic musician and super-producer, introduced the show from the DJ booth, while Kanye West, Marianne Faithfull and ex-One Direction star Zayn Malik could all be found among the crowd.  The show itself was less trip to Somerset than journey around the world. With show notes referencing New York, Tokyo, Bangkok and Paris, the collection was a dialogue between Asia and America \u2013 as if Ryan Gosling in Bangkok-set Only God Forgives was the moodboard reference. American staples came as crisp double-denim pieces, James Dean-style jeans and bowling shirts with a luxe edge. A Gosling-approved shape that has been dubbed the \u2018souvenir jacket\u2019 \u2013 a kind of slinky satin bomber \u2013 had Thai embroidery of cranes, monkeys and panthers, while Japanese Kobe leather was worked into flying jackets.  Branding was subtle but present in neckerchiefs and bowling shirts, feeding into an overall vibe of refined sportswear staples elevated to something slick. This was echoed by Rodgers\u2019 soundtrack: well-loved hits including Carly Simon\u2019s Why and Madonna\u2019s Like a Virgin masterfully mixed.  Backstage, following a stellar photo-op flanked by West and Faithfull, artistic director Kim Jones explained that he had been influenced by a luxury global style observed from his travels. \u201cThere\u2019s an easy, expensive-looking mood at the moment,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019m quite a commercially minded designer, so I\u2019m looking at what our customers are wearing.\u201d     A Rick Owens piece for the SS16 in Paris. Photograph: Guillaume Horcajuelo/EPA    That relaxed feel comes through in the branding. \u201cWe want to do it not in a tacky way, to make it feel chic,\u201d said Jones. LVMH, the conglomerate that owns Louis Vuitton, does not release figures for menswear, but the group is in rude health. In February, it was reported that profit jumped 64% and estimates put UK revenue from Louis Vuitton menswear at \u00a3127m. Jones \u2013 who once lived with Lily Allen and counts Kate Moss among his friends \u2013 has no doubt helped increase buzz around the house\u2019s menswear. The British designer joined in 2011 after working with brands as diverse as Dunhill and Umbro, and this mix of influences has proved key to his success. Earlier on Wednesday, the mood on the catwalk was less disco and more punk. At Rick Owens\u2019 January show, models wore pieces that revealed their penises, with much debate following. This time, the controversy didn\u2019t stem from Owens himself a model who held up a homemade sign to the cameras at the end of the catwalk reading \u2018Please kill Angela Merkel\u2019, followed by the word \u2018not\u2019.  While the exact meaning was unclear, it put Greece debt talks on the fashion agenda. Owens\u2019 reaction, however, was more straightforward: the designer issued a statement, saying: \u201cThis was an independent statement and does not reflect the opinion of the house of Rick Owens.\u201d  Owens would hope his collection \u2013 sleeveless leather jackets, slouchy jumpers, shorts and headpieces that looked like wind socks made of hair \u2013 would be the abiding memory taken away from this season.

Much better known, however, are the brands this $60bn (\u00a340bn) online giant operates, including restaurant booker OpenTable, hotel finder Booking.com and Manchester-based Rentalcars.com.  The group\u2019s success is based on 14,000 staff in call centres and offices around the world, speaking 42 languages collectively, and is evident in earnings forecasts 10 times the size of of Airbnb\u2019s this year \u2013 yet it receives a fraction of the attention of its more recently hatched competitor. \u201cThe size of our vacation rental business is as big as the whole of Airbnb,\u201d says Priceline\u2019s chief executive, Darren Huston. \u201cWe are a Dutch company so we don\u2019t go in the press a lot, we are less built around hype.\u201d Huston has two jobs, managing the group while also remaining head of Priceline\u2019s largest business, Booking.com, which is headquartered in Amsterdam. The vast majority of the group\u2019s revenues come from outside the US. It employs 2,500 people in Amsterdam, 2,000 in the UK, 3,000 in the US, and the rest are spread around the world, with hubs in Berlin and Singapore, where Priceline\u2019s Asian travel brand, Agoda, is headquartered.

Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty    \u201cVacationing is far more important to Europeans than it is to Americans,\u201d says Huston. \u201cPeople here get five weeks, the average American gets two weeks, and only takes one. If you look at destinations, Europe holds a commanding lead collectively over any other part of the world.\u201d It is reflected in the figures \u2013 Priceline took $50bn in bookings last year, of which nearly 87% was outside the US. Its profits come from charging a commission \u2013 typically 15%. Although its online presence means Priceline is regarded as an internet stock \u2013 it is listed on the Nasdaq in New York \u2013 its defining feature is its big offline presence. The company operates much like a traditional travel agent, with three-quarters of the workforce dedicated to interacting with people \u2013 be they travellers or hotel and restaurant managers. \u201cIt\u2019s not the kind of work that Microsoft would be naturally attracted to, or Google,\u201d Huston says. \u201cThey hope that somebody out there is doing this. They deal with ones and zeros and this is more the laying of the plumbing that allows all of that stuff to ultimately work. Fortunately we\u2019ve found a way to make what we do work. Because we do it at scale.\u201d Using people rather than computers to deal with customers may not be fashionable for internet companies, but Priceline has shown it can be profitable.

During this summer\u2019s peak, Priceline Group will be directly employing about 5,000 people in call centres. And they are not based in Bangalore. In January, a 270-person centre opened in Canary Wharf. It is a 24-hour, seven-day operation, and every employee speaks English plus at least one other language. Priceline telephone operators can hold conversations in Icelandic, Estonian, Catalan, Serbian, Latvian or Slovak.

More recently, staff have been dealing with the fallout from the Tunisian massacre.  Huston says: \u201cPeople say: \u2018What are you thinking, why are you sticking a call centre in Canary Wharf or Amsterdam?\u2019 But what we need is multilingual people from many parts of the world. We can pretty much recruit all 42 languages in London, which you can\u2019t say about anywhere else in the world.\u201d The other half of the business deals with suppliers \u2013 helping hotels, car hire firms and restaurants come online.

The group has 14,000 staff in call centres and local offices around the world. Photograph: AP    OpenTable, acquired last summer for $2.6bn, is preparing for an international push. It operates in the US and the UK, where most high-end restaurants taking bookings use its software. Sales staff go door to door, visiting six or seven restaurants a day, offering to replace the handwritten reservations book with a computer. Previously this involved hooking up a screen and a small server; today the software is in the cloud and can be accessed from a tablet. Headquartered in Connecticut, Priceline was founded in 1997, during what Huston refers to as the \u201cgimmicky, sock puppet\u201d era of the internet. Priceline\u2019s gimmick was letting the consumer name their price, and then have suppliers bid to meet it. In those days, the company sold everything from petrol to groceries and insurance. After the dotcom bubble burst, it narrowed its scope to airline tickets, hotels, car rentals and holiday packages, but expanded internationally, eventually buying Booking.com in 2005. Priceline.com became a subsidiary of a larger group, in which all six brands are run independently. So independently, in fact, that only 30 staff are employed by the overall group, and Huston spends just a third of his time on group functions as opposed to running Booking.com, which is by far the largest beast in the Priceline menagerie. Having held senior jobs at Starbucks and Microsoft before joining in 2011, Huston took over as group chief executive in January 2014, succeeding Jeffery Boyd, who turned Priceline around after the dotcom bust. \u201cI\u2019m like the guy who got appointed to run the family, but the family runs very independently,\u201d says Huston. \u201cWe haven\u2019t tried to over-integrate our acquisitions. We let entrepreneurs lead these companies for better or for worse. The cost of that is synergy potentially, but we have an allergy to coordinating. Synergy is a great word but it often comes as a distraction from the core purpose.\u201d     The dining area of the Savoy Grill, one of the restaurants bookable via OpenTable.

The largely symbolic destruction of 193.5kg of horn and 2,434.6kg of ivory came as neighbouring Zimbabwe confirmed that around 20 elephants it captured from a national park had been exported to China despite pleas from conservationists to release them. Mozambique has become a hotspot for Africa\u2019s wildlife poaching crisis, losing nearly half its elephants to the illegal trade in the past five years. It has no rhino of its own, but is known as a hub used by the trade to export horn from South Africa \u2013 where a record 1,215 rhino were killed last year \u2013 to markets in Asia. In May, police seized 1,160kg of ivory and 124kg of rhino horn, the biggest haul of rhino horn anywhere. But 12 of the 65 horns were later stolen from a police warehouse, leading to the arrests of four policemen. The burning of the seizure and the entire Maputo stockpile in the capital today follows Mozambique signing a Prince Charles-backed \u2018London Declaration\u2019 to tackle the wildlife trade, which is worth up to \u00a312bn globally.  \u201cToday sends a signal,\u201d said Celso Correia, minister for land, environment and rural development. \u201cMozambique will not tolerate poachers, traffickers and the organised criminals which employ and pay them to kill our wildlife and threaten our communities.\u201d Dr Bartolomeu Soto, director general of the National Conservation Areas Authority, said: \u201cThis event demonstrates the Republic\u2019s commitment to protecting its natural resources, and its zero-tolerance to poaching, trafficking and to the organised criminals behind this.\u201d Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), which helped fund the event, said Mozambique was making a stand. \u201cRecent efforts show real commitment to tackle wildlife crime , associated corruption and organised crime gangs,\u201d said Alastair Nelson, WCS\u2019s country director for Mozambique.  However, WWF said that while the burn sent a positive signal of Mozambique\u2019s determination to tackle wildlife crime, it was concerned that evidence connected to the thefts had been destroyed.  Heather Sohl, chief advisor of species at WWF UK, said: \u201cWWF is concerned about Mozambique\u2019s sudden decision to destroy this sizeable haul of ivory and rhino horns, because it is likely that critical evidence has been destroyed.\u201d Wildlife trade monitors Traffic raised similar concerns regarding the ivory thefts and potential loss of evidence. \u201cThe apparent destruction of evidence in ongoing cases raises obvious concerns over how the legal process will now be properly followed in Mozambique,\u201d said the organisation\u2019s Tom Milliken. The event in Maputo on Monday follows several other similar destructions of seized ivory, most recently the crushing of 907kg of ivory in Times Square, New York. More than 20,000 elephants are poached each year in Africa, driven largely by demand from a growing middle class in China and other south-east Asian countries.

The export of the elephants is legal and allowed under the wildlife trade convention, Cites. The International Fund for Animal Welfare said it was \u201csickened\u201d that the elephants, which included several calves that were reportedly separated from their mothers, had been sold despite pleas to release them back into the wild.

One wonders what the Yorkshireman would make of his former player Gary Stevens being put on gardening leave by Army United in May after just eight games of the Thai Premier League season and then, with the team in fourth, put out to pasture permanently. Just a few nights in Bangkok and such shabby treatment by a club nicknamed \u201cThe Gentlemen\u201d would have humbled many a hard man but Stevens, appointed after the end of the 2014 season, stayed positive, stuck around and sealed a new deal with Port FC the following month in June. It may mean swapping a potential title challenge for a relegation dogfight but, when the bullet comes from the country\u2019s military club, there\u2019s not much you can do. \u201cI\u2019ve got the letter here and the official reason was due to poor on-pitch performances,\u201d Stevens says. \u201cAfter five games we had won four and drawn one. We lost games six, seven and eight, won nine and 10 with a temporary coach and we were fourth in the league. \u201cI think starting so well raised expectations and you have three defeats and out here people think there is a reason why you win and there is a reason why you lose, but it happens. If we are top of the league after five games, it doesn\u2019t mean we will be champions. If we lose three, it doesn\u2019t mean we will be relegated. I told them that you have to take a longer-term view and not look at it game by game.\u201d United are not a traditional powerhouse. A ninth-placed finish in 2014, half of which was spent with the former Leicester City defender Matt Elliott at the helm, was about par for a team that never finished higher than fifth so there was no sense of impending doom in early May. \u201cI was in the office preparing for afternoon training on Thursday, a meeting was called and I was told face to face. They said that we are not firing you but we want you to go on holiday.\u201d Stevens showed his visiting sister the sights of Bangkok and then went to sit in the stands to watch United play wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with \u201cBOSS\u201d across the chest. While the signature on the official team-sheet seemed to belong to the 53-year-old, the selection of the team no longer did and soon after the departure was made the holiday became a permanent vacation. Despite the marching orders from Army, Stevens did not desert Thailand. Instead he joined Port FC in June. \u201cOut of what happened, the beneficiaries are the players at Port and myself. I improve the players and there will be happy players, happy fans and happy owners.\u201d At Port FC, the person in charge is Nualphan Lamsam, the manager of the women\u2019s national team who did so much to bring about a first appearance at the Women\u2019s World Cup in June. Stevens speaks highly of \u201cMadame Paeng\u201d as the colourful figure is known. \u201cI am no longer a hi-so,\u201d she said earlier this year, disavowing her high-society credentials as she took control of a club that hails from Khlong Toei, the wrong side of the Bangkok tracks, and has something of a hooligan image. Nothing like that was witnessed by Stevens so far in his first two games, both narrow 1-0 defeats, the second of which came at Army United 10 days ago where his name was chanted by the home fans. His first win came on Sunday, against relegation rivals TOT-CAT. There is a long season ahead but if winning the first three games at his former club soon resulted in the sack, a couple of early losses may not be a bad thing especially as Stevens is confident he can take the team, currently four points clear of the drop zone after 13 games, up the table. \u201cWe need to pick up points but we are looking upwards. I learnt a lot from Army United. You have to adapt and accept that things are different. If an Englishman comes to Thailand and say: \u2018This is how we do things in England\u2019, then you will soon realise that it doesn\u2019t always work in Thailand.\u201d The English work, though. Peter Withe as well as Stevens\u2019 1986 World Cup team-mates Peter Reid and Bryan Robson are recent head coaches of the national team. It\u2019s been harder for the former assistant at Sligo Rovers in Ireland and Gabala FC, with Tony Adams in Azerbaijan, to get opportunities back home and he believes that spending over a decade out in the real world after playing harmed his chances. \u201cI\u2019ve applied for a number of positions in England. Some of them didn\u2019t even give me the courtesy of a reply. A club in the second division will get 100 applicants so the odds are against everyone. The problem is all the people who appoint the managers in England want someone who has done the rounds so they can say \u2018he had some success at Burnley\u2019 or \u2018he did a really good job at Crewe\u2019. They just want to justify their decisions if and when it goes wrong \u2026 but if I can\u2019t get a job in England, then I will go somewhere else.\u201d And so he went from England to Thailand but an increasing number are going the other way. Fans at Sheffield United, Reading and Leicester City are getting a close look at how Thai owners operate. Such businessmen see investing in the English game, one that is so popular in south-east Asia, as a cool thing to do. Pavin Bhirombhakdi is the president of Bangkok Glass, currently challenging for the title. \u201cIt\u2019s about having a ready-made team,\u201d he said, overlooking the tidy Leo Stadium. \u201cTo do so in Thailand takes so much time but for people with the money, they can get involved in English football almost immediately.\u201d It is something that the young English-educated tycoon, who has received plenty of invitations from English clubs, may consider in the future. With teams such as Bangkok Glass and Bangkok United getting tastier on the pitch and pushing the powerhouses such as Buriram United and Muangthong United, football is improving. The national team won the 2014 AFF Suzuki Cup, south-east Asia\u2019s regional trophy, and, with six points from two games, is on course for a place in the final round of qualification for the 2018 World Cup. The Under-23s won the SEA Games in June and Thai clubs are starting to make an impact in the Asian Champions League with their best players starting to catch the attention of European clubs. That is not on the agenda of Gary Stevens just yet.

Related: Raheem Sterling tells Liverpool he wants to be left out of pre-season tour    Sterling says that his discontent with Rodgers was due to the manager not taking him seriously last season about his desire to leave Anfield to further his career. The England forward was also unhappy at not being told when Manchester City and Manchester United made initial inquiries about his availability. When Liverpool were asked about Sterling\u2019s stance they categorically denied it. However, it is clear there has been a breakdown between the player and Rodgers which makes the player\u2019s presence on Liverpool\u2019s tour to the Far East and Australia even more unlikely. City have had a \u00a340m bid turned down by Liverpool but remain interested in buying Sterling. But it is understood City have no plans to make a higher offer for a player valued at \u00a350m by Liverpool. While the hierarchy may decide to make a further offer for Sterling at some point in the future, for the moment there is no intent to do so.Sterling did not report for training at Liverpool\u2019s Melwood complex on Wednesday morning, saying that he was ill. The club did not offer any comment although the medical department has been asked to verify Sterling\u2019s claim, which is standard procedure for any player who calls in sick. The 20-year-old does not wish to take his seat on the plane when the squad fly to the Far East on Sunday to start their close-season tour. Liverpool, though, are clear he should travel and be available for selection for the first match in Bangkok on Tuesday. It remains to be seen how Sterling\u2019s feelings of discontent with Rodgers will affect the club\u2019s stance over the coming days. Liverpool may decide that it is better if Sterling is not part of the squad as Rodgers continues his preparations for the season. The manager is under pressure to ensure that Liverpool hit the ground running following the dismal end to their last campaign, during which they were knocked out of the Champions League at the group stage, lost on penalties to Besiktas in the last 32 of the Europa League and finished sixth in the Premier League, suffering a 6-1 defeat at Stoke City in their final game of the season. In order for Liverpool to improve on that performance it would hardly be of benefit to have a player who does not wish to be at the club. Luis Su\u00e1rez joined Liverpool on their pre-season tour of Australia in 2013 while pressing for a move to Arsenal. However, Rodgers and the club believed the striker could still be persuaded to stay and Su\u00e1rez returned to produce spectacular form that came close to taking Liverpool to the Premier League title. There appears to be no chance of such an outcome with Sterling, so it seems a matter of when not if he will leave. Danny Ings, who joined the club from Burnley in June, has spoken of his admiration for Rodgers. \u201cHe\u2019s fantastic at developing young players. For a player like me, I think it will be perfect to work with him. I\u2019m really looking forward to getting that relationship with him and the rest of the coaches and the players as well. It\u2019s something I\u2019m really excited to do,\u201d he told the club website. \u201cHe [Rodgers] wants me to come in, settle in and get used to the lads and enjoy training. Then we\u2019re going to do some tactical stuff, which he does with every player, as you do coming in. \u201cThen obviously I\u2019ll see how his team plays and how I can adapt to the way that Liverpool play. It\u2019s definitely going to be a challenge but it\u2019s a challenge that I\u2019m looking forward to. I just can\u2019t wait to get started.\u201d Along with Ings, Rodgers has acted swiftly in the transfer market this summer and has also signed Joe Gomez, James Milner, Nathaniel Clyne, Adam Bogdan and Roberto Firmino.", "publicationDate": "2015-07-08T19:09:00Z", "tags": ["Liverpool", "Raheem Sterling", "Football", "Transfer window", "Sport", "Brendan Rodgers"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/08/raheem-sterling-misses-training-illness", "title": "Liverpool\u2019s Raheem Sterling does not want to play for Brendan Rodgers", "sentences": ["Liverpool, though, are clear he should travel and be available for selection for the first match in Bangkok on Tuesday."]}, {"article": "Raheem Sterling has again missed training at Liverpool, having told the club\u2019s manager, Brendan Rodgers, he no longer wants to play for him.

It was meant to be: his father had met his mother at the same institution, and even his grandparents had met there.  But there was a problem. Jackie Pineda-Andrews is American. Under UK law the British spouse must have available funds equivalent to a minimum gross annual income of \u00a318,600. As Ian was still a student, he was too poor to live in his home country with the woman he loved. The couple are two of an estimated 33,000 people who have been told they cannot bring or remain with their spouses in Britain, because they do not earn enough money. The government says the minimum income rule is to prevent unqualified spouses coming to the UK and becoming dependent on the state. \u201cUniversity is a time when people start falling in love, start finding themselves,\u201d said Mrs Pineda-Andrews. \u201cBut it\u2019s also the time, and in the years afterwards, when you are earning the least.\u201d The rules were introduced on 9 July 2012, and every year dozens of couples who have been separated from their partners and children gather outside the Home Office to protest a law which means around 47% of Britons do not earn enough to fall in love with a foreigner.  Don Flynn, of Migrant Rights Network, which hosted the demo along with BritCits, an organisation for affected couples, said the British economy had suffered because of the law. \u201cThe government claimed it would save \u00a3650m, but research from Middlesex University found that if, as expected, most of these spouses would have found employment, that would have made a contribution of over \u00a3850m.\u201d   Related: Married but alone: the student couples separated by immigration laws    There was a common thread among those who came to protest on Thursday, regardless of their background. All said that everyone they met thought the law was wrong.  \u201cI live in Ramsgate, the only Ukip council in the country. I\u2019ve spoken to everyone about it, from [people in] the pub to McDonalds. Everyone says it can\u2019t be right,\u201d said Tony Stevens, who came with his Gambian wife Isha. \u201cMarriage is precious. No government, no party has the right to deny me the right to be married to the woman of my choosing. It\u2019s shameful.\u201d It has taken him and his wife two-and-a-half years and cost them \u00a37,000 to go through the immigration process. \u201cI explained to the Home Office how I\u2019m a carer here, and I look after my mother who cannot walk. Here I can support us both and send money back to her family in Gambia, and everyone benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re still told, why don\u2019t you go back and live there instead? It\u2019s immoral, ignorant and it\u2019s class-based. And we still feel soon we\u2019ll have to fight all over again because the rules keep changing.\u201d Among those protesting were family members with children living abroad, unable to return because of visa laws. \u201cMy daughter is in Istanbul with her husband,\u201d said mother-of-two Janet Slack. \u201cShe had all the benefits of an education here, health paid for by the taxpayer, and she has the experience and qualifications now. But she had never paid a penny back of her student loan, or in tax since moving to Turkey after university, because she cannot come back with her husband. Britain is losing out, and we have lost our daughter, and our other daughter has lost her only sibling.\u201d     Protesters at the Home Office quote David Cameron\u2019s words on gay marriage as they campaign for a change to the visa rules about bringing a spouse back to Britain. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    Nigel Johnson brought his 11-year-old stepson Jeff to the protest from north Devon, with the youngster proudly wearing his British public school uniform. Nigel\u2019s wife Burphan, Jeff\u2019s mother, is still in Bangkok.  \u201cWe don\u2019t even intend to stay here long term, but we\u2019ve scraped every penny together from the extended family to give this boy a proper British education. In just two years, with English as his second language, he\u2019s top of his class. But of course, he misses cuddles from his mum,\u201d Johnson said.  \u201cI\u2019ve cut grass, I\u2019ve cleaned holiday cottages, I\u2019ve worked six jobs to get my income over the threshold and still we are being turned down.\u201d The legal fight against the law is now in its final throes. In 2013, the high court found the threshold of \u00a318,600 was too high, with Mr Justice Blake calling the law \u201cunjustified\u201d but it was overturned by the court of appeal and the case is now at the supreme court, due to sit this September. That same month will also see a report from children\u2019s commissioner Anne Longfield examining the effects of the law on children separated from a parent. But many of the couples at Thursday\u2019s protest who had successfully managed to settle in the UK said they had used a legal technicality known as the Surinder Singh route \u2013 after the landmark case.  It paved the way for Britons to work abroad in another European Economic Area country before bringing a non-European spouse to the UK, so EEA law on spouses, which is more generous, can take precedent. That was the route taken by the Pineda-Andrews. With just a few weeks to go until his wife\u2019s visa expired and the pair would have to separate, Mr Pineda-Andrews took the radical decision to suspend his studies and move to Galway, Ireland for six months with his new wife.  \u201cIt was a horrible, lonely time,\u201d Mr Pineda-Andrews said. \u201cI worked in the cafe in this small town where the economy meant all the other coffee shops in the entire town had closed down by the time we left. We had no money, and we couldn\u2019t afford to visit family, no one lived there who was our age. But it was worth it.\u201d Mrs Pineda-Andrews said the system had coloured her view of Britain. \u201cI experienced so much bigotry, to be with the person I love.\u201d She smiled as she held up her passport, with the British visa inside. \u201cWe are still fighting because we want change, I wouldn\u2019t wish this on my worst enemy.

It is a rivalry running back to a match in Bangkok, October 2005. That one, like this, was settled in straight sets. But in between there have been many brilliant matches. There is an old story about two officers in Napoleon\u2019s Army, Dupont and Fournier, who fought a duel when one was made to deliver a disagreeable message to the other. There was no winner and so, each being equally stubborn, they fought again the very next time they met. This time they were interrupted, so again there was no clear conclusion. A third meeting produced a third duel. The feud re-ignited each time they encountered each other ever after. This went on \u2013 no joke \u2013 for three decades. They fought 30 times, on horseback and on foot, with swords and with pistols, on cobbled streets and grassy fields. They came to know each other\u2019s styles so well that they invariably fought to a standstill \u2013 until the day Fournier finally missed, twice, and Dupont had him at gunpoint.   Related: Andy Murray beaten by Roger Federer in straight sets in Wimbledon semi-final    Andy Murray and Roger Federer are not quite there yet. This was their 24th match. They have played on hard courts and grass courts, in Cincinnati, Dubai and New York, Madrid, Doha and Shanghai, Sydney, Toronto and Indian Wells. And of course, at Wimbledon, the scene of their two most famous matches, back in the summer of 2012, when Federer won one, at the Championships, and Murray the other, in the Olympic final. It is not the most prolific rivalry in men\u2019s tennis \u2013 Novak Djokovic and Rafa Nadal have played each other 44 times. But it is one of the hardest fought. Going into Friday\u2019s match, Federer had won 12 times and Murray 11. There have been long stretches when each man has held the upper hand. Murray won four in a row in 2008 and 2009, as has Federer in 2014 and 2015. Just like Dupont and Fournier they now know each other so well that neither has many surprises left to offer the other. Each knew what to expect in this semi-final, as did most people watching. Federer would try to control the game with his serve and his forehand, would be quick and keen to come to the net to try to close points down and would also look to attack Murray\u2019s weak second serve. Murray, on the other hand, would want to draw Federer into long cross-court rallies with his backhand and use the lob which has won him so many points already in this tournament. So Murray knew what was coming. Not, it turned out, that the knowledge made it any easier to face. At the age of 33, Federer is playing almost as well as ever. Certainly, Murray said, \u201cthat\u2019s definitely the best he served against me\u201d. In the first round at Halle back on 15 June Federer was pushed close by Philipp Kohlschreiber. In the end he won 7-6, 3-6, 7-6, after being 5-3 down in the final set. But late in the match something clicked. Ever since then his serve has been in a rare and record-breaking rhythm. After that he played Ernests Gulbis and Florian Mayer, Ivo Karlovic and Andreas Seppi and was not broken once. Then at Wimbledon he played Damir Dzumhur, Sam Querrey, Sam Groth and Roberto Bautista Agut. Again he went unbroken. In his quarter-final against Gilles Simon Federer broke Wayne Arthur\u2019s 16-year-old record for holding serve in the most consecutive games. Arthur had done it 111 times. Federer\u2019s streak got to 116. And then, finally, he was broken. Just the once, and, Simon said afterwards, it took \u201cthe perfect game\u201d to do it. And of course, Federer immediately broke back. The point is: right now Federer\u2019s serve is almost unassailable. The problem Murray faced, the problem Djokovic will face, is, how, exactly, does one go about beating a man who is unbreakable? As Murray said afterwards, he played OK, better even than that makes him sound. \u201cI didn\u2019t actually play a bad match,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI played pretty well.\u201d But he never came close to finding an answer to that one crucial question. In the first set 85% of Federer\u2019s first serves were in, in the third 81%. Federer has now played 10 matches against 10 men, two of them, Simon and Murray, among the very best returners in tennis, and he has been broken only once. Murray had an opening early on, in the very first game, a break point earned with an exquisite lob and a fine forehand down the line. But the next return went into the net, followed by an error and a service winner. The chance was gone and he did not get another. Federer\u2019s grip on the match got tighter. Murray, on the other hand, seemed always to be scrambling to find a footing. Federer made it all look so easy. The difference was never better illustrated than late in the second set. In the 10th game Federer had five set points. Murray scrambled furiously, saved each and every one, then finally won the game with an ace. In the next game Federer won to love. One game took a little under 10 minutes, the other a little more than 60 seconds. Then the pressure was all back on Murray again. This was the day that Murray, just like Fournier, ended up looking down the barrel of his opponent\u2019s loaded gun and knew that, this time, there was nothing he could do. The other man had won.", "publicationDate": "2015-07-10T19:24:25Z", "tags": ["Wimbledon 2015", "Roger Federer", "Andy Murray", "Wimbledon", "Tennis", "Sport"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jul/10/roger-federer-andy-murray-wimbledon-semi-final", "title": "Roger Federer unbreakable against Andy Murray in Wimbledon semi-final | Andy Bull", "sentences": ["It is a rivalry running back to a match in Bangkok, October 2005."]}, {"article": "Raheem Sterling will undertake a medical at Manchester City on Monday after the deposed Premier League champions finally agreed a fee with Liverpool that could potentially rise as high as \u00a349m for the England forward.

Two previous bids \u2013 the first offering an initial \u00a325m rising to \u00a330m and the second \u00a335m with add-ons to take the deal closer to \u00a340m \u2013 had been knocked back by Liverpool, with those additional clauses and payments largely dependent on City winning silverware. Yet, while Liverpool had expressed a desire to retain the England international, there was an acceptance that Sterling\u2019s relationship with the club had deteriorated markedly over the course of last season once talks over a new contract at Anfield, which were initiated last October, quickly ran aground. The player subsequently rejected a proposed deal worth \u00a3100,000 a week in March and has appeared destined to leave ever since after five years, 129 appearances and 23 goals for the club. The 20-year-old still played 52 times last season but had made clear to Rodgers his wish to depart. The issue was brought to a head on the first day of pre-season, last Monday, when he requested to be omitted from the party for the two-week tour of Thailand, Malaysia and Australia.   Related: Steven Gerrard condemns Raheem Sterling\u2019s Liverpool \u2018carry-on\u2019    Liverpool informed the player that he would be the subject of disciplinary action if he did not fulfil his club commitments but Sterling then called in sick twice last week, missing two days of training at Melwood, amid suggestions the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association might have to be called in as peacemaker. The player, who was under contract at Anfield until 2017, was at the club\u2019s training ground on Sunday morning but was told he would not be travelling after City tabled their third offer on Friday night. That had sparked further talks over the weekend before the resolution. Liverpool are now expected to re-enter the transfer market with the money generated by Sterling\u2019s sale. The Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke remains a long-standing target. The youngster becomes City\u2019s first significant signing of the summer as Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side attempt to recruit more homegrown players to bolster their options after the departures of Frank Lampard, Micah Richards, James Milner, Scott Sinclair and Dedryck Boyata this summer. Their attempts to add Villa\u2019s Fabian Delph to their squad, having activated the \u00a38m buyout clause in the midfielder\u2019s contract, were thwarted on Saturday when the player declared his intention to remain at the Birmingham club. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving,\u201d said the England midfielder, who had signed a new deal with Villa last season through to 2019 but had not travelled to Portugal for their pre-season training camp. \u201cI\u2019m staying at the football club and I can\u2019t wait for the start of the Premier League season.\u201d           The Liverpool players land in Bangkok before their match against Thailand\u2019s All-Star team    Rodgers\u2019 side play their first friendly against a Thai All Stars XI on Tuesday.

Sunday\u2019s Skype sessions are normally a right laugh, rife with David Hasselhoff anecdotes, the shipping forecast and all the inevitable highs and lows that come with the territory of being a continental tea-timely email.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cTodd Van Allen wondered about the 1,057 pedants teaching English in Japan (Friday\u2019s Fiver letters). I can\u2019t vouch for the other 1,056 but I teach International Relations here, particularly security-related issues, and therefore understand that conflict reduction is both an individual and institutionally systemic responsibility, which is why I didn\u2019t leap into the fray and decry the linguistic blunders of others, as correcting such relatively innocuous expressions as \u2018milk\u2019 and \u2018Fiver/fibre\u2019 could be regarded as aggressive. However, since another\u2019s illogical prejudice motivated me to write, I might as well point out that the discourse paradigm is flawed. The literal (linguistic) translation of \u2018schoolboy defending\u2019 is inconsequential, for the socio-linguistic (Japanese perception) of the term would be positive, indicating energetic, joyful, and zesty play. High school football and baseball are popular spectator sports here in Japan for those reasons, as is \u2018schoolgirl defending\u2019 by young Nadeshiko candidates. Oddly, the term that would possibly be most suitable is \u2018naive defending\u2019. In British football culture that would indicate a negative characteristic: immature, lacking in experience, leading to a poor result. In Japanese, however, \u2018naiibu\u2019 \u300c\u30ca\u30a4\u30fc\u30d6\u300d may indicate a lack of experience as (possibly) negative, but also (positively) unpretentious, unsophisticated, and sensitive. Perhaps The Fiver might consider relocating to have its naive research and writing efforts more positively appreciated.

BITS AND BOBS In the end it took Manchester City \u00a349m to get Liverpool to part with Raheem Sterling, with Brendan Rodgers confirming what we all knew months and months and months ago. \u201cThe situation is very simple.

Meanwhile, in Bangkok \u2026 Photograph: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images       Still in Bangkok \u2026 Photograph: John Vincent/Demotix/Corbis    Asmir Begovic has agreed a deal that will allow him to sit on Chelsea\u2019s bench for large parts of the next few seasons before frustration kicks in and he rejoins Stoke. \u201cAfter speaking at length to the manager, I feel like I can develop here and be an important part of this team,\u201d he trousered.

Crowley has excellent close control and technical ability; he can pick a pass and find pockets of space and, above all, he has the X-factor in the final third. He would describe himself as a No10, although he generally played on the left of a narrow front three for the under-21s last season, where he was able to cut inside on to his favoured right foot. Arsenal took him from Aston Villa at the end of his under-16 year and he has been capped by England at under-16 and under-17 level. Wenger has included him in his 27-man squad for the Barclays Asia Trophy in Singapore. DH   Related: Manchester City hope \u00a349m Raheem Sterling can sprinkle some stardust | Amy Lawrence    Aston Villa: Andr\u00e9 Green An England youth international, who can play on the wing or through the middle as an out-and-out striker, Green is destined to be the next one off the Villa production line. The 17-year-old was training with the first team towards the end of last term, named among the substitutes for the final Premier League game, at home against Burnley, and has travelled to Portugal for the pre-season tour. He is 6ft 2in, quick and powerful, and with Tim Sherwood prepared to give younger players an opportunity, the teenager will fancy his chances of impressing the Villa manager. SJ  Bournemouth: Baily Cargill Cargill made headlines in bizarre circumstances last December when, during the League Cup match against Liverpool, an accoutrement that appeared to be a ponytail-shaped wig fell from his head. It turned out to have been a protective bandage and Cargill, a 20-year-old central defender or left-back, will hope that his progress next season becomes a more convincing story. He was with Southampton until the age of 13 \u2013 also holding a season ticket at St Mary\u2019s \u2013 but has developed promisingly since joining Bournemouth and, following loans at AFC Totton, Welling and Torquay, made six appearances in their cup sides last season. Cargill, who was part of the England Under-20 side that finished fourth in this summer\u2019s Toulon tournament, is a composed, technically adept defender in the style preferred by the Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe. A regular Premier League place would be asking a lot at this stage but he has a useful new mentor in Sylvain Distin and, even if a loan to the Championship looks a logical next step, there is genuine hope that he has a first-team future at the top. NA Chelsea: Bertrand Traor\u00e9     Bertrand Traor\u00e9 in action for Vitesse Arnhem during their pre-season friendly match against Chelsea at the Gelredome Stadium on July 30, 2014. Photograph: Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images    The Burkina Faso teenager was granted a work permit earlier this summer and will be with the senior squad for Chelsea\u2019s tour of the United States aiming to prove he can be Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s fourth-choice forward. The winger, who had first alerted Chelsea\u2019s scouts to his talents as a 14-year-old at the under-17 World Cup in 2009 while he was still being developed by the French club Auxerre, signed professional terms on a four-and-a-half-year contract at Chelsea in January 2014 but did not receive international clearance to feature. He then spent the last season and a half at Vitesse Arnhem where the head coach, Peter Bosz, successfully converted him into a striker who contributed 17 goals in all competitions last term. Bosz, when confirming Traor\u00e9 would not be returning to Holland next year, admitted Mourinho \u201cis crazy about him\u201d having coached him first-hand on a similar tour of east Asia two years ago. DF Crystal Palace: Sullay Kaikai Alan Pardew should already be acquainted with Kaikai\u2019s talents given the forward scored a last-minute equaliser in a League Cup tie when he brought his Newcastle side to Selhurst Park earlier last season. The 19-year-old, a winger or centre-forward, played 10 times for Palace\u2019s under-21s last term, scoring six goals, prior to a loan spell at Cambridge United which yielded a further six in 30 appearances. The League Two club duly awarded him their young player of the year prize, an accolade that was followed up by Palace\u2019s development player of the year and the vice-presidents\u2019 young player of the year awards for 2014-15. Pardew rewarded him with a place in the travelling party for the trip to Liverpool towards the end of last season and, while another loan spell away probably beckons once the campaign proper begins, he will have opportunities in pre-season to make his mark. DF Everton: Chris Long The Huyton-born striker will view Everton\u2019s pre-season as a second chance to showcase his first-team claims to the manager, Roberto Mart\u00ednez, having impressed last summer only to find opportunities nonexistent once the Premier League campaign began. Long scored a fine goal against the Bundesliga newcomers Paderborn last August but senior outings for the 20-year-old were confined to a late substitute\u2019s appearance in a Europa League dead-rubber against Krasnodar. He joined Brentford on loan in January where, despite injury interruptions, he scored four goals in 10 appearances as the Championship side reached the play-offs. A quick forward and composed finisher, Long has been with Everton since the age of five and represented England from under-16 to under-20 level. With Mart\u00ednez\u2019s striking options currently limited to Romelu Lukaku and Arouna Kon\u00e9, there is an opening for Long should he deliver. AH Leicester City: Ben Chilwell One of three youngsters to travel with the first-team squad to Austria for the pre-season tour, Chilwell was named Leicester\u2019s academy player of the year last season and has already attracted interest from Arsenal. An England youth international, Chilwell is quick, composed on the ball and has a superb left foot. Aged only 18, the left-back still needs to develop physically but Leicester believe that he has every chance of making the grade at the highest level. He should get a chance to impress in the pre-season friendlies and may well go out on loan after September. SJ Liverpool: Jo\u00e3o Teixeira It is testament to the Portuguese midfielder\u2019s determination to force his way into Brendan Rodgers\u2019 plans next season that he is involved in Liverpool\u2019s tour of the Far East and Australia at all. The 22-year-old broke his leg on 14 April playing for Brighton and Hove Albion against Huddersfield Town. Twelve weeks later he was back in first-team training at Melwood and selected for the pre-season tour, on which he set up two goals against Thai All Stars on Tuesday. Teixeira, signed from Sporting Lisbon in 2013, made an impact on his Liverpool debut, a 3-2 win at Fulham during the team\u2019s title-challenging season, but it was last season at Brighton where his adaptation to the English game gathered pace. The gifted midfielder scored six goals in 35 games under Sami Hyypia and his replacement, Chris Hughton, with his performances encouraging Rodgers\u2019 belief that he would be worthy of inclusion in the Liverpool squad for the 2015-16 season. The leg break appeared to stall that opportunity, but it is back on already. AH     A burst of pace from Liverpool\u2019s Jo\u00e3o Teixeira takes him past Witthaya Madlam as Liverpool face the Thailand All Stars in Bangkok. Photograph: Pornchai Kittiwongsakul/AFP/Getty Images    Manchester City: Cameron Humphreys  What an opportunity for the youngest member of Manchester City\u2019s touring squad to soak up the big time alongside David Silva, Joe Hart, Vincent Kompany and company. At 16 the Manchester-born defender will eat sleep, train and play alongside the club\u2019s bona fide trophy-laden superstars as Pellegrini\u2019s band visit Australia and Vietnam. Humphreys operates at centre-back and can also play right-back. While it is the longest of long shots for Humphreys to somehow force his way into the senior squad for next term the player who has led England in his age group, represented City under-18s and been involved with the under-21s can gain invaluable experience for his future career. JJ Manchester United: Sean Goss The schemer born in Wegberg, Germany, is the sole unknown in Louis van Gaal\u2019s touring party which is packed, surprisingly for a pre-season trip, with more experienced players. Goss joined from Exeter City in 2012 and his passing ability is complemented by an eye for goal. The 13 he struck for Exeter helped gain the move to United and Goss has impressed enough to be compared with Michael Carrick. Van Gaal\u2019s squad is now heavy with central midfielders. The arrivals of Bastian Schweinsteiger and Morgan Schneiderlin added to Carrick, Marouane Fellaini, Ander Herrera and Daley Blind means Goss will struggle to make Van Gaal\u2019s strongest XI by the close of the tour. Yet as a fan of the club who was once a United mascot he is living the dream. \u201cI was picked out of a big draw to be mascot when I was about seven, to walk out at Old Trafford when Exeter drew 0-0 here [in 2005], and I was buzzing. I\u2019d been up a few times with my dad as we\u2019ve got family who live here as well. I remember staying over and watching United play Charlton in the last game of the season. Obviously as I\u2019d been before, I knew what it was like,\u201d he told Manutd.com. JJ Newcastle United: Jamaal Lascelles Steve McClaren will look at a handful of Newcastle\u2019s younger players during their pre-season tour of the US, and the former Nottingham Forest centre-back Lascelles will be familiar to him as an adversary from the Championship. Lascelles and the goalkeeper Karl Darlow were signed by Alan Pardew a year ago and loaned back to the City Ground for a year. That deal, worth \u00a37m, caused the former Forest manager Stuart Pearce to fall out with their chairman, Fawaz al-Hasawi, and Pearce has since gone on record as saying that Lascelles is not yet ready for the Premier League. But the 21-year-old has the pace and technical attributes to fit nicely into the McClaren scheme and, having completed 45 minutes in Newcastle\u2019s first pre-season friendly against Gateshead, should receive more opportunities during their four-game tour. McClaren\u2019s centre-back options do not extend too far beyond Fabricio Coloccini, Steven Taylor and Mike Williamson, and Lascelles may well feel that a place is up for grabs.

Photograph: Mike McGinnis/Newcastle United via Getty Images    Norwich City: Louis Thompson Norwich were buying potential when they paid Swindon Town an initial \u00a3600,000 for Thompson last September. The 19-year-old was loaned straight back to his old club as they sought to escape League One but a dislocated shoulder curtailed his season in February. Central midfield is Norwich\u2019s strongest area but Thompson, who made his debut for Swindon a month after turning 17, has joined up with them for pre-season and the early noises have been approving. Thompson has all the tools for the box-to-box midfield role \u2013 boundless energy, an eye for a pass and a willingness to shoot \u2013 and could be a contender to force his way into Alex Neil\u2019s first-team thinking sooner rather than later, especially if Norwich struggle early on. It was Neil\u2019s predecessor, Neil Adams, who signed Thompson but Neil is believed to rate the youngster highly. He has represented Wales at Under-19 level and his older brother, Nathan, is himself a well-regarded right-back at Swindon. NA  Southampton: Will Wood  The 18-year-old left-sided centre-half, who can also play at left-back, has already enjoyed a breakthrough of sorts, having been taken by the manager, Ronald Koeman, to the first team\u2019s training camp in Austria. He came on as a half-time substitute against RB Leipzig last Wednesday, and both Koeman and the assistant, Sammy Lee, were happy with his performance. A member of the team that won the Premier League Under-21 Cup last season, he signed a three-year professional contract the following day. He had a spell, previously, as a left-sided midfielder for the under-18s and he promptly scored five goals in five games. Wood has been at Southampton since the age of 11 and he hopes to be around the first-team squad this season. DH Stoke City: Moha El Ouriachi Following in the footsteps of Bojan and Marc Muniesa, both of whom swapped the Camp Nou for the Britannia Stadium, is Moha El Ouriachi, a 19-year-old who arrived from Barcelona at the back end of last season. Blessed with quick feet and a change of pace, Moha played on either flank while coming through the ranks at Barcelona but is predominantly left-footed. A Spanish youth international who is also eligible to play for Morocco, Moha is seen by Mark Hughes as capable of making the transition from under-21 football to the first team in the near future, with the Stoke manager including him his party for the Asia Trophy in Singapore. SJ  Sunderland: Duncan Watmore Like Cargill, Watmore was prominent in England Under-20s\u2019 Toulon campaign \u2013 and was named \u201crevelation of the tournament\u201d after a successful first international call that brought two goals. Watmore, a 21-year-old winger who is the son of the former FA chief executive Ian Watmore, is yet to play a league game for Sunderland but was named the Under-21 Premier League\u2019s player of the year last season and his claim for a place in Dick Advocaat\u2019s squad is a convincing one. The purposeful, direct Watmore was signed two years ago from non-league Altrincham after scoring 14 times in the 2012-13 season. He subsequently spent time on loan at Hibernian and would not be short of suitors for a similar stint at Championship level if playing time became hard to come by in the coming months. He should be given his chance to impress in pre-season and his rapid progress in the past 12 months suggests that he could bring the kind of energy and excitement that Sunderland have lacked.

Photograph: Ian Horrocks/Sunderland AFC via Getty Images    Swansea City: Modou Barrow The 22-year-old burst on to the scene last November when he made his debut as a second-half substitute against Arsenal and had a hand in one of the goals in a 2-1 win. Pacey and direct, Barrow can play through the middle but is more likely to be used as a wide man at Swansea. Garry Monk, Swansea\u2019s manager, has described the Gambia international as \u201cfearless\u201d. Signed from the Swedish club Ostersunds FK last summer, Barrow was given an improved four-year contract in January \u2013 a measure of how highly Swansea rate him \u2013 and the Premier League club hope he can make an impact this season. SJ    Related: Every club wants one but where have all the (good) strikers gone?    Tottenham Hotspur: Dele Alli This 19-year-old is a more established prospect, given he made 62 appearances in League One for MK Dons, and it took a \u00a35m fee to get him to Tottenham but it will be interesting to see whether he can handle the step up and make an impression early on. Alli is confident he can. He has no intention of going out on loan; merely of forcing his way into Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s first-team plans. A driving, old-school, box-to-box midfielder, he has goals in his repertoire, too, and the capacity for one or two screamers. He is desperate to impress and he has torn it up so far on the pre-season fitness tests. With Paulinho and Etienne Capoue sold and doubts over the future of Benjamin Stambouli, opportunity could knock in central midfield. DH Watford: Tommie Hoban     Watford\u2019s Tommie Hoban in action against St Albans City in their pre-season game at Clarence Park, St Albans . Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images    The closest Watford have to a prodigy is Hoban, an assured centre-back who at 21 and four years after his debut has made 54 league appearances, precisely half of those coming last season. That he was such an important part of a promotion-winning squad is testament to his character as well as his ability: Hoban missed a year\u2019s action from February 2013 to February 2014 after sustaining an ankle injury that required surgery. He has also appeared for Ireland at youth and Under-21 levels and, prior to that period on the sidelines, was linked with a number of top clubs. Watford have already signed another central defender this summer in Sebastian Pr\u00f6dl, an Austria international, leading Wolves, Nottingham Forest and Charlton among others to attempt to convince Hoban\u2019s employers to allow him to leave on loan, but he certainly has the potential to play in the top flight. SB  West Bromwich Albion: Jack Fitzwater Albion are blessed with some promising youngsters, including Jonathan Leko and Tyler Roberts, both of whom have only just finished school and featured in the 3-1 defeat against Red Bull Salzburg last week, but Jack Fitzwater\u2019s emergence has slipped under the radar a little. A 17-year-old centre-half who can also play at right-back, Fitzwater came on in the friendly in Austria and also made the cut for the 21-man pre-season tour in America. Named academy player of the year last season, he reads the game well, uses the ball intelligently and, more than anything, enjoys putting his body on the line and defending.

The England Under-17 captain was on the bench on a couple of occasions last season and he is highly regarded at Upton Park. He is primarily a centre-back, although he produced a composed performance as a defensive midfielder against Lusitans, even if he was booked for a heavy challenge in the first half.

A judge has until 1 September to decide on the verdict on Morison, 67, editor of the independent news website Phuketwan, and Thai reporter Chutima Sidasathian. On Tuesday, the prosecution made its case against the two for criminal defamation and on charges under the Computer Crime Act, which bans online material considered a threat to national security. On Wednesday and Thursday, the defence called witnesses but the prosecution did not appear to cross-examine.  \u201cIt could be that they are confident that they are going to win the case on the basis of the prosecution witnesses. Or it\u2019s a tacit acknowledgement that they don\u2019t have a case,\u201d Morison said. The hearing ended in the early afternoon on Thursday. The case relates to a 41-word paragraph from a Reuters news agency report on the trafficking of Rohingya refugees, which was republished on Phuketwan. Reuters, one the largest new organisations in the world, has not been charged. Abdul Kalam, a Burmese Rohingya activist who has lived in Bangkok for decades, was on the stand on Thursday. He described to the court how members of his ethnic minority group have told him about their experience with human traffickers in Thailand. \u201cHe said that one of the consistent points that many of the Rohingya make is that the navy is involved,\u201d Morison said. The Thai navy has denied its officers were involved in trafficking. But since the charges were brought against the two journalists last year, the Thai government has launched investigations into official complicity in the trafficking trade and a senior military official was arrested. Thailand\u2019s ruling junta, which toppled the government of Yingluck Shinawatra in a coup last May, has stifled the media and banned political gatherings. The trial has been widely condemned by human rights and media freedom groups.

Rights advocacy group PEN American Center, said the \u201cgovernment of Thailand should refocus its energies on curbing collusion in human rights abuses by members of its own navy, rather than frivolous attempts to camouflage them by shackling the press\u201d. Morison said he was optimistic.

The surrogate \u2013 who is biologically unrelated to the baby \u2013 handed over baby Carmen to Gordon Lake, an American, and his Spanish husband, Manuel, in January but later refused to sign documents to allow the infant to get a passport. \u201cI was flabbergasted, in a complete state of shock. It\u2019s your worst nightmare in a process like this. I didn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Lake, 41, told the Guardian. \u201cWe sent messages back. Hoping there was some sort of miscommunication. We were terrified.\u201d Six months later, the family of four, including his 23-month-old son \u00c1lvaro, also a surrogate baby born in India, are living in a secret location in Bangkok, afraid that Carmen will be taken away. They chose Thailand for its top rate medical facilities and established surrogacy industry for gay couples. But while Carmen \u2013 biologically his and an anonymous egg donor\u2019s \u2013 was in the womb, the military overthrew the government. The coup was shortly followed by a series of high-profile surrogacy scandals that led to a ban on the industry. The first involved a 24-year-old Japanese businessman who had fathered 16 children, mostly through Thai surrogates, shocking the nation. The other was the case of baby Gammy, who has Down\u2019s syndrome and was left with the Thai surrogate mother even as his parents took his twin sister back to Australia. Adding to the hysteria, it later emerged that the father was a convicted sex offender, court documents revealed. So Lake was relieved when the surrogate happily signed the release documents to allow them to take Carmen from the hospital. \u201cI took her flowers,\u201d Lake said of the surrogate. \u201cWe have a really cute picture of her and my son.\u201d     Gordon Lake, left, with Manuel and their son \u00c1lvaro and daughter Carmen in Bangkok.

She wanted Carmen back. \u201cShe said she thought she was doing this for an \u2018ordinary family\u2019 and when she found out that it wasn\u2019t an ordinary family she was worried for Carmen\u2019s wellbeing,\u201d he said. He spoke to the Guardian via Skype as his lawyer has advised him not to disclose his location. He says the surrogate has asked several times for him to bring the baby to her. In March the surrogate appeared on Thai TV. Hiding her face with a beige hat and aviator sunglasses, she said she could not understand the surrogacy contract because it was in English. She said she felt a moral urge to help a \u201clegitimate married couple\u201d and even paid her own medical bills \u2013 a claim Lake denies, saying he has paid about US$35,000 $47,000) for the entire process. Speaking to the Guardian, the surrogate\u2019s lawyer, Verutai Maneenuchanert, said the surrogate found out the men were gay only when she saw documents Lake left in the hospital room on the day of the birth. But she denied that was the reason the surrogate wants to keep the baby. \u201cIt is because ... she will never ever sell her baby for money,\u201d she said. Maneenuchanert, who has equated commercial surrogacy with human trafficking, also speculated that the fertilised egg might have belonged to the surrogate, giving her a biological link to the baby. Lake says he has documents proving the egg came from a donor.   Related: Thailand bans commercial surrogacy    The big question for Lake and his family is why the surrogate did not know he is gay, a point he says he was clear about with the agency they used: New Life, which has branches in eight countries. When military rulers in Thailand cracked down on the commercial surrogacy industry last summer, New Life\u2019s office in Thailand closed. After that, Lake said he did not receive much information. At one point, he stopped receiving medical scans of Carmen. New Life\u2019s website deals directly with the changes in Thai laws last summer which banned commercial surrogacy and affected many parents. \u201cCo-founder of New Life Global Network, Mariam Kukunashvili, emerged as a ray of hope for thousands of destitute parents,\u201d it says. \u201cThe parents having apprehensions regarding our ability and integrity were offered complete refunds.\u201d Lake said the only refund he received was 1000 Thai baht ($40) to cover one taxi fare. \u201cMariam was definitely not a \u2018ray of hope\u2019 for us whatsoever,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as we know they have done nothing.\u201d Kukunashvili told the Guardian in an emailed statement that New Life is trying to help Lake \u201cin any possible way\u201d. She said the surrogate knew they were gay parents from the beginning of the process \u2013 a charge the surrogate\u2019s lawyer denies \u2013 and that the contract was bilingual. She added that Lake and his husband did not follow New Life\u2019s instructions and the situation has since become \u201cunmanageable\u201d. Lake and his family have a new lawyer and will launch a court case for full parental rights of Carmen later this month.

So profitable is the trade in slaves that some local fishermen in Thailand have been converting their boats to carry Rohingya migrants instead of fish.    Related: Sold from a jungle camp to Thailand's fishing industry: 'I saw 13 people die'    A Guardian investigation into Thailand\u2019s export-orientated seafood business and the vast transnational trafficking syndicates that had, until recently, been holding thousands of Rohingya migrants captive in jungle camps, has exposed strong and lucrative links between the two.  Testimony from survivors, brokers and human rights groups indicate that hundreds of Rohingya men were sold from the network of trafficking camps recently discovered in southern Thailand.  According to those sold from the camps on to the boats, this was frequently done with the knowledge and complicity of some Thai state officials. In some cases, Rohingya migrants held in immigration detention centres in Thailand were taken by staff to brokers and then sold on to Thai fishing boats.  Other Rohingya migrants say Thai officials collected them from human traffickers when they arrived on the country\u2019s shores and transported them to jungle camps where they were held to ransom or sold to fishing boats as slave labour.  Thailand\u2019s seafood industry is worth an estimated $7.3bn a year. The vast majority of its produce is exported. Last year, another Guardian investigation tracked the supply chain of prawns produced with slave labour to British and American supermarket chains. Though the Guardian has not irrefutably linked individual Thai ships using Rohingya slaves to specific seafood supermarket produce, the likelihood is that some seafood produced using this labour will have ended up on western shelves.   Route of Rohingya migrants driven out of Burma, heading for Malaysia Route of Rohingya migrants driven out of Burma, heading for Malaysia   The scale of the profitable and sophisticated human trafficking networks making money from the desperation of hundreds of thousands of stateless Rohingya \u201cboat people\u201d has been emerging over the past weeks. Tens of thousands of Rohingya  fled state-sponsored ethnic cleansing in Burma in the first three months of this year. Stateless and unwanted, their only option was to take to the seas in their desperate attempt to reach the relative safety of Malaysia. In March, the special rapporteur on human rights in Burma, Yanghee Lee, told the UN Human Rights Council that Rohingya people in camps for internally displaced people had only two options: \u201cstay and die\u201d or \u201cleave by boat\u201d. The plight of the victims recently attracted international attention following the discovery of several abandoned vessels containing hundreds of starving Bangladeshi migrants and Rohingya refugees, which Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia all initially refused to allow ashore. In May, officials in Thailand and Malaysia also discovered a number of jungle prisons and mass graves used as holding pens for the traffickers\u2019 operations.  These jungle camps were used as open-air prisons in which the inmates were held captive while they were ransomed to their relatives for sums often exceeding a thousand pounds. Many of those held in the camps were raped, tortured or beaten to death.  Camp survivors and brokers, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity, said that those who could not raise the money demanded by their captors would be sold into slavery in return for a fee paid by the boat captains. Their testimonies corroborate the accounts of rights groups investigating Rohingya trafficking.  A young Rohingya migrant described how he was sold by traffickers from the jungle camps on to a boat carrying the Thai national flag in Songkhla, southern Thailand, before escaping at the end of last year. \u201cWe were taken [from the camps] by boats and cars, we arrived in Songkhla and were put on to the fishing ship,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were forced to work there. We had to work on the sea for about four years. During this time the ship never came back to shore.\u201d Matthew Smith, executive director of Bangkok-based Fortify Rights, said the link between the camps and the fishing industry was well-established and had a long history. \u201cWhen men or boys [held in traffickers\u2019 camps] are unable to pay \u2026 to secure their freedom they are often sold to fishing boats for use in slave labour. This has been happening for decades. It\u2019s a situation in the Thai fishing sector that\u2019s been going on since the 90s, at least as far as we can tell,\u201d he said. A broker interviewed in Bangkok acknowledged the use of Rohingya slaves in the fishing trade, recounting how he had sold around 100 people from the jungle camps over the past year, some as recently as early this year, making around 30,000 Thai baht ($900) per sale.

Photograph: Chris Kelly    \u201cThey [the migrants] were bought by the Thai boat captains,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cthey could never leave the boats because they might run away, and then [the captains] would lose their labour. I\u2019ve heard that if they can\u2019t work [the captains] throw them into the sea.\u201d In addition to Rohingya, he sold Laotian, Burmese and Cambodian migrants as slave labour to the ships. Despite a crackdown on the use of slave labour by the Thai government, evidence suggests that the sale of Rohingya kept in jungle camps was happening as recently as early this year. Thailand is facing unprecedented pressure to tackle human trafficking and clean up its fishing industry. This April the EU gave Thailand six months to crack down on illegal fishing and labour abuses or face a trade ban, which could see Thailand lose up to \u20ac1bn a year in seafood exports.  In recent months, Thailand has claimed to have taken decisive action, shutting down all active Rohingya trafficking camps and pushing through a series of hasty reforms in its seafood sector, including requiring boat owners to register migrant workers and undergo new licensing and registration of all boats and equipment to try and stave off the EU ban.  \u201cThe government does not mean to hurt anyone. But we have to adjust the country\u2019s fishing system,\u201d said Minister Peetipong Phuengbun, agriculture and cooperatives minister, last week. Seafood prices are reported to be rising across the country and according to the Thai Overseas Fisheries Association, about 3,000 fishing ships will not go to sea because of fears of fines imposed for not complying with the new regulations. In the first week in July this year, fishermen in 22 provinces across Thailand went on strike, protesting about the hastily imposed reforms,which they say are costing the industry $444m a month. Fishermen in Ranong say that that these reforms, coupled with decades of overfishing and ecological destruction that has pushed fish stocks to the brink, mean they are increasingly unable to make a living. Instead, they are increasingly turning to another line of business: people trafficking. \u201cRight now ... it\u2019s really hard to find fish in the Gulf of Thailand. When this kind of job comes along it can make me money,\u201d said one boat owner. \u201cThe more people I bring, the more money I make \u2026 and to be honest, I want to make money. We can transport 300 to 400 people, because we have a big boat.\u201d Another local boat owner told the Guardian that he knew of 10 boats operating from the same port, carrying 12,000 Rohingya migrants a month. These migrants could be worth around $24m in ransom money.  \u201cI earned 30,000 baht ($900) [through fishing], but if they [transport people] they earn 100,000 baht ($3,000),\u201d the boat owner said. Thailand will be hoping that its public effort to tackle its trafficking problems will earn it an upgrade in this year\u2019s US State Department Trafficking in Persons report (TiP), which evaluates countries based on their success in combating the activities of traffickers in their jurisdiction, which is due to be published this week. In 2014, as the Guardian revealed Asian slave labour was producing prawns for supermarkets in the US and UK, Thailand was relegated to tier three, the lowest possible ranking.

In these jungle base camps, until as recently as this year, Thai fishing boats provided a lucrative secondary revenue stream for the highly organised and ruthless criminal gangs profiting from the plight of the stateless Rohingya people fleeing persecution and violence in Burma. Survivors have told the Guardian of how men were routinely sold into forced labour by traffickers intent on maximising profits wherever they could.  \u201cThey sold people to the fishing boats or to work for hard labour,\u201d said one man, who did not want to be identified. \u201cThey sold people wherever they could get money.\u201d The prospect of being sold on to a boat was used to terrify migrants into raising up to a thousand pounds in ransom payments from their families.

Only a Thai man protected us, otherwise we would have been killed at sea.\u201d In some cases, it was the Thai authorities who brokered the deals with the boat captains. Another Rohingya man, now also living in Malaysia, spoke of how he was sold by immigration officials into slavery on a fishing boat in Ranong, western Thailand.     \u2018When I was in the jungle camp, 50 to 60 people died within one and a half months\u2019 \u2026 a trafficking camp survivor.

Once, my friend was beaten so badly they broke his legs and [he] couldn\u2019t walk. He died ten 10 days later.\u201d The scope and scale of the lucrative and sophisticated human trafficking networks that have grown up to exploit and profit from the plight of the Rohingya has been emerging over the past months. Rohingya have been trafficked into Thailand and Malaysia from Burma for decades, fleeing state-sanctioned persecution and extreme deprivation. An estimated 100,000 Rohingya have fled the Bay of Bengal in the last three years, with more than 25,000 Rohingya and Bangladeshis boarding smugglers\u2019 boats in the first three months of 2015 alone.  In May, footage of starving Rohingya refugees, abandoned by their traffickers on sinking vessels and initially refused permission to land by Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, brought international attention to the human rights catastrophe unfolding across Asia.  The discovery of a string of abandoned trafficking camps in Thailand and Malaysia, with their barbed wire cages and isolation cells, and the exhumation of mass graves containing the bodies of Rohingya migrants, followed shortly after.    The Guardian was shown a boat that had been converted to carry people rather than fish \u2013 up to 400 people at a time    Faced with mounting international condemnation, the Thai government set a deadline of 10 days to close down the remaining camps and stop the trafficking operations. It now insists human traffickers no longer operate within its borders.  At the same time, it is also pushing through a series of wide-reaching reforms in its fishing industry after the EU threatened to ban all imports of Thai seafood if the industry didn\u2019t clean up its act; a move that could cost Thailand almost \u20ac1bn . Thailand\u2019s global fish exports were valued at $7.8bn in 2013. Last year, $717m of Thai fish exports \u2013 weighing 146,000 tonnes \u2013 were destined for European tables, where it made up more than 3% of the continent\u2019s fish imports. For boat captains, these reforms means potential ruin. They say they will be unable to earn a living if the government forces them to comply with new regulations aimed at eradicating illegal fishing, including registering all migrant workers. In a fishing port in Songkhla, posters protesting against the reforms hang from every wall. One reads, \u201cDo not destroy fishermen just for the sake of profit-making and foreigners. Stop harming fishermen. We want justice.\u201d In Ranong, fishermen, who are also faced with increasingly empty nets after decades of overfishing and environmental destruction, say they have no choice but to turn to another kind of business \u2013 human trafficking. The Guardian was shown a boat that had been converted to carry people rather than fish. This one boat can now carry up to 400 people at a time.  \u201cRight now ... it\u2019s really hard to find fish in the Gulf of Thailand. When this kind of job comes along it can make me money,\u201d the boat owner said, \u201cThe more people you carry, the more money you get.\u201d     For boat captains in Thailand, the fishing industry reforms mean potential ruin.  Photograph: Chris Kelly    Rohingya migrants in Malaysia also spoke of a grim evolution in the trade and exploitation of vulnerable migrants making their way across the open sea from Burma. As their jungle camps are shut down, trafficking syndicates are reportedly taking their operations off-shore to huge multi-storey cargo ships acting as holding pens for thousands of Rohingya.  One woman told us how the smuggling boat she was travelling on was hijacked by armed men as they made their way from Burma across the open sea. \u201cThey pointed guns at my children and said, \u2018Don\u2019t move. Don\u2019t speak or we will shoot,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThe big boat was built like a holding camp. We had to sleep on top of each other.\u201d The off-shore boat prisons are allegedly being facilitated by Thai fishing boats.  \u201c[The trafficking ship] was surrounded by fishing boats,\u201d she said. \u201cThe boats would phone the big ship then it would move. When people died on the big boat, the dead bodies were taken away by the fishing boats.\u201d For now, boat captains say many of the smuggling rings and trafficking syndicates have gone to ground as the Thai and Malaysian authorities continue to make a public display of their efforts to rid their waters of this now very-public blight on their international reputation. Yet human rights groups in the region are warning that not enough has been done to prevent the trafficking of Rohingya from continuing unabated once the pressure subsides. \u201cState policies of persecution [against the Rohingya]... are continuing,\u201d says Matthew Smith, director of human rights group Fortify Rights. \u201cAs long as that\u2019s happening, people are going to flee their homes \u2026 and they\u2019re going to take to the seas because they see that\u2019s the only option they have.\u201d The following months could also prove decisive for Thailand\u2019s fishing sector, as it works to convince valuable trading partners that it is serious about reforming an export industry increasingly seen to be built on slavery, environmental destruction and illegal practices. Siddharth Kara, a Harvard economist and world expert on modern slavery and human trafficking, believes that the fate of Thailand\u2019s fishing industry now hangs in the balance.  \u201cAs the industry has evolved across the last several decades the sad truth is forced labour has become fundamental to the economic logic of the Thai seafood sector,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you suddenly strip out forced labour an industry can fall apart ... and maybe it should.\u201d *Identities protected", "publicationDate": "2015-07-20T11:23:03Z", "tags": ["Global development", "Rohingya", "Thailand", "Fishing", "Slavery", "Refugees", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Environment", "Malaysia"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/20/sold-from-jungle-camp-thailand-fishing-industry-trafficking", "title": "Sold from a jungle camp to Thailand's fishing industry: 'I saw 13 people die'", "sentences": ["In a humid hotel room in Bangkok, a low-level broker describes personally selling more than 100 Rohingya on to fishing vessels."]}, {"article": "It took Azima a month travelling to wed her childhood sweetheart. In that time, the 17-year-old witnessed men beaten to death, starvation, rape and an attempted suicide. \u201cWhen the men complained, the smugglers beat them,\u201d Azima said, recalling the days she spent living with hundreds of people on a boat in the Indian Ocean. They used an inch-thick red cane. \u201cI saw seven people die.\u201d The Burmese Rohingya woman paid to be smuggled to Thailand so she could build a family, a goal that has become harder for her ethnic minority in Burma\u2019s western Rakhine state as many men have already fled state-backed persecution. Anxiously waiting for her in the Thai capital was Hussein, whom she met as a child in her village. \u201cOur homes were near, we would meet in the street or at school,\u201d she said, smiling and wearing a brown veil dotted with decoration. Both from farming families, they had small plots of land used for growing rice, beans, potatoes and chillies. Hussein had already managed to leave Burma by land, with his mother. Two years later, with Azima\u2019s parents too old to farm and the police harassing her, she felt her life had become desperate enough to risk the journey.     Azima sits next to her husband, Hussein, at his family apartment in Bangkok, Thailand. Photograph: Oliver Holmes for the Guardian    It was easy to find a people smuggler \u2013 one lived in her village, a man named Anwar.  One night, he came to the farm where Azima lived. \u201cHe told me to come with him that night to his house,\u201d she said, recalling saying goodbye to her parents. \u201cThat same night we were brought to the sea and boarded a dinghy with Anwar\u2019s men.\u201d The dinghy was crammed with about 30 people, Azima recalls. They sped out to sea under the stars until they approached a green ship with three decks and more than 400 people onboard.  Azima was told to sit on the middle level. She met other Rohingya that night who said they had been waiting for days for the ship to fill up \u2013 Azima\u2019s small dinghy was the last group and so they started for Thailand, a seven-day journey south. \u201cWomen were fed once a day in the morning,\u201d Azima said. \u201cMen were not given food.\u201d The idea, she speculated, was to starve them to the point where they would have no energy to rise up against the 10 smugglers who ran the ship. But after a few days with no food, some men protested at the conditions. Seven were beaten to death by the crew, she said. \u201cUs women got dried fish and sometimes a small bottle of water,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so crowded that we would lie down on top of each other\u2019s bodies and sleep during the day and in the cooler night-time we would just sit.\u201d    The army made us build roads at night-time. I would work as a porter without payment       Two of the smugglers were themselves Rohingya, including a religious leader, she said. The other eight were Thai. Towards the end of her time at sea, Azima saw an old man jump overboard after days of not eating or drinking. \u201cHe wanted to die,\u201d she said. The old man was dragged back on board and tied to a pole. Azima\u2019s story illustrates a Burmese society broken by apartheid-like rule. One in 10 Rohingya in Burma have fled by boat. Tens of thousands of men have departed, so that now the cost of a dowry in Rakhine has risen significantly. Now girls such as Azima are taking the perilous boat trip so they can marry. \u2018We were tortured all the time\u2019 Azima says she was never attacked or abused but that the women on the upper deck would come downstairs to use the single toilet and talk of sexual attacks. \u201cThey said: \u2018We are tortured all the time\u2019,\u201d Azima said. Ashore in Thailand, the group was taken to the hills in the jungle to be held before their families, or in Azima\u2019s case her fiance, paid the ransom to have them released. The Guardian cannot independently verify Azima\u2019s story, but the details of sexual abuse, killing and enforced malnourishment by human smugglers are corroborated by the UN, which has interviewed hundreds of Rohingya over several years. The UN refugee agency estimates 620 people have died at sea since October, primarily as a result of starvation, dehydration and beatings by boat crews. While Azima was in the jungle, her fiance deposited 70,000 Thai baht (\u00a31,300) into a smuggler\u2019s bank account. He and his father are now heavily burdened with debt. Hussein says he had to flee two years earlier as he was particularly vulnerable to abuse from the authorities \u2013 his father Asiya, 47, also fled the country for Thailand in 1991 when he joined a revolutionary movement, leaving his wife and six-month-old son in the village as the passage overland to Thailand was too dangerous. As Hussein grew up, his land was seized and he was imprisoned three times. Each time, his mother would have to pay bribes to get him released. \u201cWe were always paying bribes,\u201d Hussein said, wearing the traditional Burmese longi, a type of sarong. \u201cThe army made us build roads at night-time. I would work as a porter without payment.\u201d Burma\u2019s 1.1 million Muslim Rohingya are a stateless people. They have been persecuted for decades, but in 2012 deadly clashes with the Buddhist majority in Rakhine caused 140,000 Rohingya to flee their homes. The government denies that it is persecuting Rohingya and says accusations are \u201cone-sided\u201d. Hussein fled with his mother just days before the killings in 2012, when authorities could be bribed to help them take the safer overland route to Thailand. Once there, Hussein, 22, met his father for the first time since he was six months old.     There were only 12 smugglers but they had guns       He lived with his parents and younger siblings in a one-room apartment on the outskirts of Bangkok and started selling pancakes to schoolchildren. He mixes the batter himself, crouching over a plastic bucket filled with molten butter and flour.  Bodies left in the jungle Hundreds of miles south in the jungle, Azima was being held in an open prison. She was kept with other women on a plastic sheet in the jungle. The smugglers had cut a few trees down but there were no cages or buildings. The prisoners were so badly malnourished and the jungle so dangerous, there was little point in escaping. \u201cWhen we arrived, sometimes we got food twice a day,\u201d she said, adding she counted about 460 people in the camp, which was moved occasionally to avoid police. When it rained, the women would hold the sheet over their heads. For 13 days, she sat there, among a group of women who hoped they could keep the smugglers away if they bunched together. The men were so weak at this point that some of them were dying, Azima said. Their bodies were left in the jungle.

Low-cost carriers have boomed in southeast Asia, but KLIA2 is not the first airport to face expansion problems. Bangkok\u2019s Suvarnabhumi airport suffered similar cracks on taxiways having opened in 2006 on a reclaimed swamp east of the Thai capital. For years it was beset by hours-long immigration, over-capacity and management problems, which threatened to damaged Thailand\u2019s tourist-friendly image.

However, the reality of criminalising those who pay for our services is that sex workers are left with fewer clients, including men who we might otherwise have felt able to turn away - those who seem drunk, aggressive or who have a reputation for violence. Furthermore, by prioritising the supposed \u201ceradication\u201d of the sex industry, these laws empower police officers to harass, evict and deport migrant sex workers. This is exactly what Amnesty found when it looked at the Swedish model. In Norway the police had a virulent attitude towards women selling sex, and sex workers felt that reporting violence to the police was in itself dangerous because it attracted police attention. As one sex worker told Amnesty: \u201cIf you call the police, you lose everything.\u201d    It is essential to listen to sex workers all over the world in order to draft laws to help keep us safe    Amnesty found that sex workers in Norway were routinely evicted by the police. The organisation\u2019s report states that \u201ca number of migrant sex workers were violently attacked and raped \u2026 They reported the incident to the police \u2026 they returned to their apartment to find the police have removed all their money and electronic equipment. Four days after the attack they were forcibly evicted.\u201d It\u2019s hard to believe that those Hollywood signatories read this and thought: \u201cBrilliant, the police evicting migrant women when they report rape sounds like the feminist solution to prostitution; we should support the legal model where this occurs.\u201d But that is what appears to have happened \u2013 unless they signed up to attack Amnesty over a document they had not read. The draft policy specifically notes that the voices of sex workers are often \u201cobscured or silenced\u201d during such debates. It is ironic that the vilification heaped upon Amnesty demonstrates just how true that is. A representative from an organisation campaigning for \u201cfeminist criminalisation\u201d (there\u2019s no difference to sex workers between \u201cfeminist\u201d and \u201ctraditional\u201d criminalisation when the police are at our doors) incredulously told a journalist: \u201cAmnesty is not listening \u2026 if Amnesty isn\u2019t listening to them [celebrities], then who are they listening to?\u201d The idea that Amnesty might prioritise the voices of sex workers in a conversation about sex work was apparently incomprehensible.

Isis is smart \u2013 it disperses forces and hides in cities. Air power has not been able to supplant boots on the ground, and putting boots on the ground would be foolish in the extreme. So what is to be done? First, learn the lessons of history \u2013 you cannot change religious beliefs with bombs. Second, don\u2019t abrogate complex political decisions to the military-industrial complex. Third, stop selling arms to anyone in the Middle East. Finally, deal with the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, because without doing so the hatred will never stop.David ReedBoulder, Colorado, US Self-deception on warming So, according to Laurence Tubiana, France\u2019s climate change ambassador, the switch to a greener economy will involve \u201cmassive [green] acceleration\u201d (Fossil fuel industry must \u2018implode\u2019, 17 July). Well, that certainly sounds great but I have strong misgivings about such statements of \u201cgreen-growth\u201d. Yes, what exactly does \u201cacceleration\u201d mean? Do we want our sunbeds and frappucino machines to be powered by renewable energy? And what does talk of \u201cinvestment\u201d in the low-carbon economy mean? Does it mean, for example, more electric cars so that we can cruise around in \u201cclean\u201d vehicles, focusing in on the small percentage of electricity produced from wind and solar sources while ignoring the rest from nuclear and coal? While the conclusions drawn in this article are frighteningly correct, the solutions being proposed are simply pie-in-the-sky. I will not believe that we are serious about preventing climate change until we finally agree to put our money where our mouth is. The obvious way to do this is to simply tax and regulate the \u201cdamaging factors\u201d out of our economy. This sounds draconian but if governments were brave enough to \u201ctake our consumerist toys away\u201d, then local economies and supportive local societies would flourish and we would be a lot happier. You might take your holiday in Blackpool rather than in Bangkok and you might find yourself stitching shirts rather than peddling stock-futures but what is an economy for, if not to let the work of its members to provide for the needs of its members? If we were prepared to step back from some of our pollution-intensive practices, then we would see that life could be better. Not easier, but better.Alan MitchamCologne, Germany \u2022 Despite robust scientific evidence, we continue to cause global warming (eg, Plunging oil sets off new global contest, and Arctic oil drilling is \u2018insane\u2019, says Gore, as Shell exploration nears, 24 July). An important corrective can be found in the book A Perfect Moral Storm by philosopher Stephen Gardiner. Gardiner\u2019s says that our first moral tragedy is passing on the cost of climate change from the most affluent to the poorer citizens of the world. Second, the present generation is tempted to pass the problem on to future generations. Third, our poor grasp of science, international justice and the human relationship to nature helps to facilitate inaction. As a result, we are engaging in wilful self-deception, while the lives of future generations, the world\u2019s poor and even the basic fabric of life are at stake. Gardiner concludes that we should wake up to this ethical failure, and demand more of our institutions, our leaders and ourselves. Let us hope that whichever political leaders attend the Paris climate change conference in December have a broad grasp of the ethical issues involved.Bryan FurnassCanberra, Australia Antipodean socialism As an aside to Laurence Blair\u2019s fine article on the failed Australian paradise in Paraguay in the 1890s (17 July), it\u2019s worth pointing out that Australian utopian socialism didn\u2019t only fail in South America but lost its way in the antipodean motherland as well. In that decade, colonial Australia had, as part of its makeup, a strong idealistic belief that it was possible to avoid the evils of the class-ridden old world in favour of a cooperative existence in the new. That idealism was smashed by the colonial elites of the day. The compromised socialism that survived is what we have to live with down under today in an even more compromised form. Terry HewtonAdelaide, South Australia Corbyn and the Labour party The Jeremy Corbyn putsch seems unstoppable (24 July). Other UK Labour leadership candidates are faced the with the horrific prospect that their flight to the right isn\u2019t as popular as they believed. At one point in the leadership election I was pretty sure that, although I mostly agreed with him, I wasn\u2019t going to vote for Corbyn. There were a couple of reasons, including the purely emotional one that he puts my teeth on edge, but mostly because I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s not got what it takes to lead the party to victory. It\u2019s a strong argument. But I don\u2019t have any confidence that any of the other candidates has what it takes to get Labour elected either. What I do know is that following the Tory-lite approach lost us the election. So I may as well go for a party leader who will at least return some sanity to this incessant drift to the right and who will set up Labour as a party with some soul and ethics again. If we are going to go down again, then let\u2019s go down fighting for something worthwhile.Ian RichardsonLondon, UK Certainly not a failure Nicholas Lezard\u2019s review of the book National Service: A Generation in Uniform 1945-1963, entitled A failed experiment (17 July), does not explain who conducted the \u201cexperiment\u201d, what its purpose was nor how it failed. Instead Lezard has produced a very lopsided rant about the negative aspects of National Service and not mentioned the positive side. I went through National Service from 1946 to 1948, aged 19-21, and spent most of it in the Middle East. It was a very beneficial experience that led to a propensity to travel for much of my life and a university degree, which I could not have got without government financial assistance. I never had to face the barbed wire and alsatians Lezard mentions as obstacles to buying bags of chips. Certainly, privacy was at a premium, but so it was in boarding schools. The main complaint was having to leave a girlfriend, but I never heard of any suicides, which Lezard states were \u201cfrequent\u201d. My brothers and a couple of friends went through National Service and their experiences were similar.

One reason the Khan made that decree was because his normal capital, Khanbaliq (present-day Beijing), was too hot during the summer months. So he moved his court 200 miles north each summer to a site in what is now known as Inner Mongolia.  Marco Polo, the Venetian explorer who visited Xanadu in around 1275, wrote: \u201cThe Khan abides at this Park of his for three months of the year, to wit, June, July and August; preferring this residence because it is by no means hot; in fact it is a very cool place.\u201d Cool in both senses of the word. At Xanadu, the Khan didn\u2019t have one palace but two: an impressive marble palace that teemed with gilt, had flora and fauna painted on the walls and featured a collapsible cane palace that was secured against the winds by 200 cords of silk. Inside the park were rivers, brooks, meadows and some kind of menagerie of wild (but not ferocious) animals. Ming invaders destroyed Xanadu in 1369 and, while the site was added to Unesco\u2019s world heritage list in 2012, little remains of the Khan\u2019s summer capital. Which is a shame because, in these sweltering days, we need to remind ourselves of the value of the summer capital.     The remains of Xanadu, Kubla Khan\u2019s legendary summer capital, in what is now Inner Mongolia. Photograph: Jia Lijun/Xinhua Press/Corbis      In May this year, about 100,000 government employees upped sticks from Jammu to Srinagar    Not that the institution is altogether obsolete. In the north Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, for instance, the \u201cDarbar Move\u201d each May sees the state government move from Jammu, the winter capital, to Srinagar, its summer equivalent, from May to November. This exodus was reportedly introduced 90 years ago by the then Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, Partap Singth, because Srinagar\u2019s winters were severe and the valley in which it lies was cut off from the outside world during winter months. At the time, fewer than 100 staff were involved in the Darbar Move; in May this year, about 100,000 government employees upped sticks from Jammu to Srinagar. And no wonder: Srinagar is 1,730 metres above sea level and has daytime summer temperatures of between 21 to 30 degrees, much cooler than the scorching plain below. It also has sumptuous gardens, trees, lakes and vistas of a mosaic landscape of green rice fields and meadows below. In November, they\u2019ll all head back to Jammu again. Critics point out this bi-annual move costs hundreds of thousands of pounds, and wastes eight weeks each year packing, unpacking and travelling. From time to time there have been calls for Srinagar to be the capital throughout the year, but they have never been adopted, not least because the city of Jumma benefits economically from the arrangement, and because doing so might increase tensions between between Muslim Kashmir and Hindu Jammu.     Estonia\u2019s \u2018summer capital\u2019, Parnu. Photograph: Alamy    In Europe, P\u00e4rnu, a delightful little city on the Livonian coast, calls itself Estonia\u2019s summer capital \u2013 but it isn\u2019t really. The country\u2019s government doesn\u2019t actually move from Tallinn to the seaside for the summer months. Instead, the title was conferred on the city in 1996 and, if nothing else, helps P\u00e4rnu brand itself as a go-to town, with miles of beaches, white sands, mud baths and state-of-the-art conference facilities. The more excitable tourist guides call it Estonia\u2019s Miami Beach. In the 17th century, the present-day Thai city of Lopburi was known as Lavo and served as the summer capital of the Ayutthaya king Narai before falling into ruins. In the 19th century, it was rebuilt and Lopburi became the summer capital for King Mongkut, AKA King Rama IV, the king of Siam (the model for the character Yul Brynner played in The King and I). One reason this alternative capital was revived was because it was about 100 miles north of the heat and pollution of Bangkok. True summer capitals have long been associated with colonial rule. The hill stations of Baguio in the northern mountains of Luzon became known as the summer capital of the Philippines during the US occupation in 1903, because Baguio\u2019s cool climate was preferable to the sweltering, humid summers in Manila. And while the label has long since been discontinued, the Philippines\u2019 supreme court sensibly still has summer sessions there. And then there is Shimla, currently capital of the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh in the Himalayan foothills. During the Raj years, Shimla (or Simla, as it was then known) was the summer capital of British India \u2013 from where one-fifth of humanity was ruled. As Anu Anand wrote, Shimla \u201conly exists because the British couldn\u2019t cope with the heat\u201d.     The Lincolnshire seaside resort of Cleethorpes \u2013 future summer capital of the UK? Photograph: Alamy    What Simla was to the Raj, and Lopburi to the king of Siam, Cleethorpes could be to modern Britain. If only the British government decamped from hot and sticky London during the summer months to the fresh and bracing north-east Lincolnshire coastal resort, then many people would benefit. Not least the local businesses and government bodies of North East Lincolnshire who, right now, are trying to work out ways of growing the local economy and rebranding their area. Nobody\u2019s saying Cleethorpes could be Xanadu, but it could be Lincolnshire\u2019s answer to P\u00e4rnu or Srinagar. Of course, the summer capital proposal needs to be handled with care. If there is anything to learn from these historical examples, it\u2019s that establishing a summer capital can be disastrous for the rulers \u2013 if not the ruled. \u201cUltimately, it was the physical distance and aloofness that governing from Shimla encouraged which helped fuel the British empire\u2019s demise,\u201d notes Anand. To avoid such a fate, here\u2019s a proposal for Britain that no other court or government I am aware of has ever tried: namely, a rotating roster of summer capitals. Cleethorpes one year, Balmoral the next (true, the royal family also sets up camp there every August, which means there would be double booking issues; but a summer capital in Royal Deeside would show disaffected Scots the Westminster government isn\u2019t at all remote from concerns north of the border), then Blackpool, Llandudno, Weymouth and back to Cleethorpes, for instance.    Related: Where is the world's hottest city?    By moving the government around the country, nobody can whine about how distant from real life our MPs and bureaucrats are. And a roster of summer capitals would also serve as a useful economic boost to the UK\u2019s more deprived regions, especially if located in the kind of coastal town that, in Morrissey\u2019s words, \u201cthey forgot to close down\u201d. Incidentally, if you\u2019re wondering why Weymouth appears on my meticulously researched list, it\u2019s because it has previous status as a summer residence. During the 18th century, William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh and brother of King George III, would spend his summer months at Gloucester House in the Dorset resort. What\u2019s more, during his recovery from porphyria in 1789, George III convalesced there. Today, Gloucester Lodge has been converted into flats and the lower ground floor is a pub/restaurant called the Cork and Bottle. It\u2019s right on the esplanade and has a fabulous sea view. With a few compulsory purchase orders and a lick of paint, it would be perfect as the new seat of the Westminster government \u2013 at least until mid-September, anyway.

St\u00e9phane Dujarric, the spokesman for the UN\u2019s secretary general, admitted that the current system for obtaining work experience \u201cclearly disqualifies people\u201d and \u201cbasically allows the UN to have people who can afford it\u201d. The issue of unpaid work experience was highlighted by the plight of David Hyde, 22, who resigned from his post in Geneva after revelations about his sleeping arrangements caused uproar. Hyde, who had flown 11,000 miles from New Zealand to take up an internship, said accommodation costs in the Swiss city were unaffordable. Images of the international relations graduate \u2013 standing in an immaculate suit, UN badge around his neck, next to a small, blue tent and rolled-up foam mattress by Lake Geneva \u2013 had circulated on social media.   Related: Unpaid UN intern who slept in tent quits after media uproar    According to the latest UN staff data available, for the year 2012-13, 4,018 unpaid interns worked across all the agency\u2019s departments, 68% of whom were women. Dujarric said the competitive roles typically last for two months, with the chance of extending the time by an extra month, and involve attending important meetings, drafting notes and participating in general office work.  He said there can be opportunities to work in offices from New York to Bangkok, and Nairobi to Geneva. The number of UN interns has fallen over the past decade as rules and regulations have been tightened and all internship appointments must now be made through human resources, according to Dujarric. When asked if the UN would change its policy not to pay interns in the light of the publicity over Hyde, he said: \u201cYes, I think it\u2019s obviously a discussion that will be had internally here. \u201cIt has to do with the member states, and the general assembly, and the budget that\u2019s given to us, and how we are able to use that that budget. \u201cWhen I take on interns I always tell them, although internship is full time, we are flexible in terms of allowing them to take time during the day if they need to get some sort of a job that pays them some money.\u201d In the interim, he said, those who apply for positions need to fully understand the terms of the internship. However, UN organisations that are not part of the secretariat can make their own rules about paying interns \u2013 such as the International Labour Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the International Fund for Agricultural Development \u2013 and pay some sort of remuneration, according to Ahmad Fawzi, the director of the UN Information Service in Geneva.   Related: Interns: all work, no pay    Matthew Hamilton, the founder of the campaign group Unpaid is Unfair, said of the policy: \u201cIt obviously discriminates against anyone who cannot afford to work for free, in particular people from the developing world.\u201d He said unpaid interns had to figure out how to pay for housing and food, health insurance and even visas. Hamilton said: \u201cIt can easily cost $10,000\u2013$20,000 to do an unpaid internship for six months once you factor in all of those costs. It\u2019s completely absurd to expect young people to front those costs.\u201d Hamilton, who lived off his university stipend for his masters degree while on the UN internship programme, said: \u201cI\u2019ve heard stories from interns who sacrificed their life savings to do an internship at the UN, only to find that there is no paid job offered to them down the road.\u201d  Ian Richards, the president of UN International Staff Unions, said in a statement that the global body needed \u201cthe brightest minds, not those with the deepest pockets, to live in expensive cities like New York and Geneva\u201d. He said: \u201cBy banning payment of interns, the general assembly makes it harder for the UN to attract interns from developing countries, of which there are currently two out of 162 in Geneva.\u201d Richards said the UN has just agreed on a set of ambitious development goals to accomplish by 2030, adding: \u201cIt needs young people within its ranks from all countries.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2015-08-14T18:31:45Z", "tags": ["United Nations", "World news", "Europe", "Careers", "Work & careers", "Switzerland"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/14/un-employed-thousands-unpaid-interns", "title": "UN employed more than 4,000 unpaid interns in 2012-13, figures show", "sentences": ["He said there can be opportunities to work in offices from New York to Bangkok, and Nairobi to Geneva."]}, {"article": "Bill Norways\u2019 poem is inscribed on a slab of dark granite next to a gravestone in eastern Japan, thousands of miles from where he wrote it. It begins: \u201cOur world decreed; that we should meet; as enemies; without a common tongue \u2026\u201d When Norways, a former British prisoner of war, composed those words in a letter to Kameo Yamanaka, his former Japanese prison guard, he could have had little inkling that they would bring two families together in remembrance 70 years after the end of the second world war. As Japan marked its wartime surrender at the weekend with a ceremony in Tokyo attended by the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and Emperor Akihito, the bond that formed between Norways and Yamanaka stands as a lasting testament to the power of reconciliation. Norways, an East Ender with a gift for drawing and painting, was a corporal in the Cambridgeshire Regiment when he was captured by the Japanese during the fall of Singapore in February 1942. It was there that he met Yamanaka, whose acts of kindness sustained his faith in humanity amid the wickedness of camp life. The young Japanese soldier \u2013 a devout Buddhist with a unbreakable belief in pacifism \u2013 shared his rations with starving prisoners and used his meagre army allowance to buy food for certain PoWs, including Norways.

With paper and pencils in very short supply, he would risk punishment by occasionally smuggling in pencils to ensure that Norways could continue drawing. \u201cDespite the obstacles and differences between the two men, it is clear that they shared a similarly compassionate view of the world,\u201d Bill\u2019s 48-year-old son, Toby Norways, told the Guardian earlier this month during a trip to Japan to meet Yamanaka\u2019s family.

Bill Norways spent more than a year in Singapore before being sent to help build the Thailand-Burma \u201cdeath railway\u201d. Most of the hundreds of British PoWs who built the line had been sent back to Singapore by February 1944. British military records show that Norways, who suffered bouts of dysentery, was too sick to leave his camp in Kanchanaburi, Thailand. But by April 1944 he was well enough to return to Singapore, where he remained until Japan\u2019s defeat in August the following year. Before he left Singapore, Norways secured Yamanaka\u2019s address in Japan, though neither was sure that their friendship would last beyond the war. Nevertheless, after returning to England, Norways sent a speculative letter to the address scribbled in his notebook. A while later he received a reply in beautifully handwritten Japanese accompanied by an English translation.     Bill Norways, left, on his way home after Japan\u2019s defeat in the second world war. Photograph: Toby Norways    The two men continued to exchange letters for more than 30 years until Norways\u2019 death in 1986. Yamanaka, who was convinced he would be the first to die, would outlive his friend by a decade. \u201cTheir letters always maintained that friendship is possible, irrespective of political and social ideologies,\u201d said Toby Norways, a scriptwriting lecturer at the University of Bedfordshire who is turning his father\u2019s experiences into a PhD thesis and a novel. Seven decades after captor and captive struck up their unlikely friendship, Toby decided to delve into the past life of the father he never really knew. Bill rarely mentioned the war to his family, and saw little of his son after divorcing his mother and moving to Cornwall when Toby was eight. Thanks to Yoshiko Tamura and Taeko Sasamoto of the PoW Research Network Japan \u2013 who were awarded MBEs in 2006 for their contribution to UK-Japan relations \u2013 Norways discovered that the Yamanaka family still lived at the same address in Ibaraki prefecture north of Tokyo that Bill had written in his notebook. Earlier this month, Toby came face to face with the daughter, granddaughter and other relatives of his father\u2019s former guard. \u201cIt was quite emotional, and a bit surreal,\u201d said Norways, as he clicked through photographs of him and the Yamanaka family.     Kameo Yamanaka, left, with Taku Kawarai.  Photograph: Toby Norways    \u201cIt was a shame that I never really talked deeply with my father. I would have loved to talk with him about his wartime experiences, though I never really had the opportunity. Besides, PoWs rarely discussed their war stories with spouses or relatives.\u201d Before returning to England, Toby faced a potentially more difficult meeting, with an old friend of Yamanaka\u2019s. As an office assistant in the Kranji camp, Taku Kawarai never really got to know Bill Norways, and said he had never witnessed the brutality towards PoWs for which Japanese camps were notorious. Most of what he knew of the British prisoner had come from Yamanaka, whom Kawarai had met in Vietnam in 1941, while they were completing basic training. The Japanese soldiers, who hailed from the same prefecture, travelled from Vietnam to Bangkok by road, before continuing on foot to Singapore, where they stayed until the end of the war. They remained close friends until Yamanaka\u2019s death in the mid-90s. \u201cHe burst into tears and held my hand when he saw me,\u201d Toby Norways said of Kawarai, who will turn 102 next month. As they prepared to say goodbye, Kawarai again clasped his hand and said: \u201cI have no words. Thank you. I have never felt so happy. Please take care of yourself.\u201d As Norways left the room, Kawarai remained seated on the tatami-mat floor, weeping. \u201cMeeting Mr Kawarai, and seeing his tears, brought home how powerful feelings of regret can be \u2013 even after so many years,\u201d Norways said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that this apparently charming old man could have been part of such a brutal opposing army. But I don\u2019t blame him for the crimes committed by so many of his comrades.\u201d     Bill Norways, centre, serves food at a Japanese POW camp in Kranji, Singapore. Photograph: Toby Norways     Related: From Burma to Nagasaki: the man who walked through hell    Of all the correspondence that changed hands between Bill Norways and Yamanaka, it is the poem that he dedicated to his former guard that resonates most with these two families on opposite sides of the world. In his reply, Yamanaka wrote: \u201cThank you for your poem. I would like to engrave it upon granite, which we can place near my family tomb.

Photograph: Guardian    Leify Porter, 27, from Sydney, Australia  My boyfriend John and I were crossing the sky bridge near the InterContinental Hotel, and we heard this explosion directly beneath us. We fell to the ground. The blast was so big; there was so much smoke and the fire came up so high. There was fire, shrapnel and so much smoke. The whole ground and everything shook. I thought everyone was going to fall. We couldn\u2019t see anything around us. I\u2019ve never experienced anything like it before. After the blast, we ran down the stairs. We saw people crawling around the road with missing limbs. People\u2019s bodies were scattered, their legs were torn off and there was blood everywhere. Everyone was running. It was quite chaotic. Our ears were ringing and our heads hurt. People didn\u2019t know whether to run or help.  We were there before the paramedics arrived. John was going to go closer and wanted to help, but I kept telling him we had to get out of there. There were clearly dead bodies lying around but no one went near them. I saw at least 12 injured people, and at least three dead bodies lying on the road. We didn\u2019t go to the hospital. We were going to but my brother in the UK said there were other bombs. As soon as I got the text we turned back. We were frightened and didn\u2019t want to travel. The pain in our ears is quite bad. It feels like pressure. I\u2019ve never felt anything like it. John described what happened as a pull in the air. The feeling in the ears was so intense. And then ringing. I was crying for a while.

Almost everyone in my carriage was trying to call others on their phones and looking at photos of the scene on social media. I saw three police with torches at the nearby Royal Thai police station looking under bushes and walking the grounds in an apparent effort to search for other bombs. Police and the fire brigade have cordoned off the area with tape. Hundreds of onlookers but mostly police and some journalists. Everyone jumped when thunder clapped above. There is a hospital right next to the blast site but there is a long line of ambulances and so other ambulances are taking wounded to other medical centres.

Related: Bangkok explosion: witness reports    There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the deadly assault in which more than 123 people were injured is a major test for the military-run administration, which ousted the elected government in May 2014.

Photograph: Mark Baker/AP    Bangkok has been mostly calm since the coup last year but anger from the opposition has intensified after the junta said it may not hold elections until 2017. The last major bombing in Bangkok occurred on New Year\u2019s Eve at the end of 2006, when three people were killed in a series of explosions. Responsibility was never claimed. Police and the fire brigade cordoned off the entire intersection with tape and human barriers. Four major roads and the above-ground metro rail converge here, and high-rise hotels and malls line the street. Shards of glass lay on the road and a sign from the nearby Alexander McQueen shop had letters missing from the impact of the blast. Hundreds of onlookers, mostly from the security services but also journalists and some tourists, stood at the edge of the tape. When thunder clapped in the clouds above, everyone jumped. The UK Foreign Office said people should \u201cmonitor media and take extra care\u201d after the explosion. It later released a statement saying: \u201cWe are in contact with local authorities and urgently seeking further information following reports of an explosion in Bangkok.\u201d At the multistorey Grand Hyatt hotel, which is right next to the shrine, locals and tourists waited for the situation to calm down, looking at photos of the wreckage on social media as they sat only metres away.

A volunteer medic said: \u201cSome people died here, some people died at hospital.\u201d  A full death toll would come later, medics said, as many of the critically wounded had been sent to different hospitals. The explosion was large enough to throw a metre-wide chunk of metal to a third-floor balcony on the other side of the street, about 50 metres away. Human flesh lay on the road and medics were picking it up two hours after the blast. The shrine is a major attraction for visitors from Asia and for Thai people. Dedicated to the Hindu god Brahma, it is also popular among Thailand\u2019s Buddhist and Chinese tourists.  Nearby tailors sell suits to tourists and diplomats, and the road straddles the capital\u2019s main metro line. Several ambulances rushed along the road away from the shrine to hospitals. Most of the wounded were taken to a hospital very close to the blast site and a long line of ambulances waited outside. Empty wheelchairs and stretchers stood at the entrance to the emergency care unit, where people were packed into the reception. In the lobby, police said foreigners who speak Thai had arrived to volunteer to help translate for wounded tourists. Hospitals were calling for Chinese translators and many had arrived and registered their mobile phone numbers with the police, to be called on later. Tony Chan, a Chinese physical education teacher, said he was in Bangkok on a three-week trip and came to the hospital to see if he could do something for the wounded. \u201cI heard a very loud sound. I thought it was thunder. Later I saw the news so I came to see if I could provide some help,\u201d he said.

Two pipe bombs exploded in the same district in February but did not cause significant damage. The Thai government posted a statement late on Monday evening, attributed to Maj Gen Werachon Sukhondhapatak, saying preliminary investigations had revealed that an IED was used to cause the explosion. \u201cAs for possible motivations as to who may have caused this incident, it is too early to speculate which group may have been responsible for this crime but authorities are following possible leads.\u201d     Thai police scour the street in front of the shrine.

Beijing has faced international criticism for its harsh treatment of the Uighur ethnic minority who come from Xinjiang, a sprawling region of deserts and mountains near China\u2019s border with Afghanistan, Pakistan and Kazakhstan. Sina, a major Chinese web portal, wrote: \u201cThere is much speculation at the moment regarding who was behind the bombing. Given that the Thai government has previously repatriated terrorists back to China, some suggest that the bombing could have been a revenge act, trying to make the Thai government to \u2018pay the price\u2019 for its pro-China behaviour. \u201cThe location of the bombing is also noteworthy \u2013 it is the Erawan shrine, which is most popular among Chinese tourists,\u201d it added. So far, no evidence has been offered, in either China or Thailand, to support any suggestion of a link between Uighurs and the Bangkok bombing.

The prime minister, General Prayuth Chan-ocha, who heads the self-appointed National Council for Peace and Order, admitted the regime had suffered an unprecedented security failure.  Ministers said on Tuesday they had no inkling that an attack on this scale was being planned, no warning, and had next to no idea who was responsible.  \u201cThis is the worst incident that has ever happened in Thailand,\u201d Prayuth said. \u201cThere have been minor bombs or just noise, but this time they aimed for innocent lives. They want to destroy our economy, our tourism.\u201d   Related: Bangkok bomb: Thai capital reeling after deadliest attack in years     Prayuth did not say who \u201cthey\u201d \u2013 the perpetrators \u2013 were, and it seemed clear, one day after the attack, that the junta was clutching at straws as the hunt for the individual or individuals responsible got under way.  The prime minister suggested security camera footage from the scene, a famous Buddhist shrine, pointed to a culprit or culprits. But he conceded the footage was far from conclusive. \u201cToday we have seen the closed-circuit footage, we saw some suspects, but it wasn\u2019t clear,\u201d Prayuth said. \u201cWe have to find them first.\u201d  In an attempt to show he was on top of the situation, Prayuth said he had ordered the police and security forces to \u201churry and find the bombers\u201d. But he also admitted the attack could have been the work of a lone terrorist.  Asked by reporters if he had any firm evidence or leads, he replied testily: \u201cWe are still investigating. The bomb has just exploded why are you asking now? Do you understand the word investigation? It\u2019s not like they claim responsibility.\u201d  Unless it can achieve an early breakthrough in the investigation, the regime may face pressure to call in outside expertise. Tony Abbott, the Australian prime minister, has offered his country\u2019s assistance and other allies, principally the US, may get involved, especially if a link emerges to international terrorist groups such as Islamic State.     The junta is clutching at straws as the hunt for the individual or individuals responsible gets under way    The continuing lack of any claim or statement by those behind the attack has fed a storm of speculation in a country unaccustomed to large-scale terrorist incidents of this type. Prayuth was quoted by news agencies as saying that a man seen on CCTV may have belonged to an anti-government group based in Thailand\u2019s north-east \u2013 a reference to the rural power base of the country\u2019s redshirt movement, which is loyal to the ousted prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, and her exiled brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, who was also overthrown in a coup in 2006. Such a statement would risk provoking a strong reaction from his political opponents. However, Thai media later said the quote was not referring to the suspect. A crackdown on political protests, opposition dissent and independent journalism since last year\u2019s military takeover has brought relative quiet to the streets of Bangkok in recent months. Hundreds of regime opponents have been arrested.  But tensions have been rising again as the date for new elections has repeatedly slipped. On seizing power, Prayuth said national polls to restore democracy would be held by or after October this year, but the junta recently suggested the vote might be put off until at least 2017.  Thaksin posted a message on YouTube last week urging his followers to reject the junta\u2019s proposed constitution because he said it was undemocratic. The draft charter is due to be voted on next month by the junta\u2019s national reform council, with a public referendum possibly to follow next January.  Both the regime and independent observers have discounted involvement in the attack by ethnic Malay Muslim separatists who have waged a long and unsuccessful campaign against rule from Bangkok in Thailand\u2019s southern provinces bordering Malaysia.   Related: Bangkok bomb blast: the day after - in pictures     Security chiefs said the separatists had hitherto eschewed direct attacks on the capital and that the type of bomb used \u2013 a 3kg (6lbs) pipe bomb \u2013 was not part of their armoury.  Suspicion has also fallen on expatriate Uighurs or their sympathisers after Thailand accused more than 100 of them of being terrorists and deported them to China. China\u2019s Muslim Uighur minority, concentrated in the western province of Xinjiang, has long complained of persecution by the \u201ccolonialist\u201d authorities in Beijing. Many have fled the country. About five Chinese nationals were reported to be among those killed in Monday\u2019s blast, and many more were injured.  More worryingly, perhaps, for western countries at least, is the suggestion, again unsubstantiated at this stage, that there may be a link between the Bangkok attack and international jihadi terrorism as practised by Isis, al-Qaida and like-minded groups.  Connections have been drawn in the past between Islamist hardliners in Malaysia and Indonesia and the Philippines-based terror group, Abu Sayyaf, an al-Qaida affiliate. In 2002 hundreds were killed and injured in an attack by Jemaah Islamiyah on western tourists and others in Bali. But by and large, the south-east Asian region has escaped the kind of carnage often seen in parts of the Middle East.  Claims by junta officials that the Bangkok attackers were intent on damaging Thailand\u2019s lucrative tourism industry will carry a chilling echo in Tunisia, whose tourist trade was badly hit after June\u2019s lethal beach attack by a jihadist in Sousse.

Safe and sound at the Teen Choice awards \u2026 Jason Derulo. Photograph: Jason Merritt/Getty Images    When you consider what we\u2019re up against, Jason Derulo\u2019s recent altercation with Southwest Airlines staff in Nevada almost makes sense. The R&amp;B singer and his entourage were set to travel to last Saturday\u2019s Teen Choice awards in LA from Reno-Tahoe International airport. In what may have been the only display of rational and relatable behaviour from Derulo and his posse, they elected to use the TSA pre-check system. It\u2019s essentially a pre-registered fast-track queue that lets US travellers skip the modern hell of departure security once they\u2019ve been deemed low-risk travellers by the US government. Unfortunately for Derulo et al, the pre-check machines were down. The singer was allegedly told that he would have to stand in line like everyone else. \u201cWe were literally just trying to not cause a ruckus,\u201d Derulo later said. \u201cMy security was just trying to tell the agent, \u2018Can we go to this section so we don\u2019t cause a ruckus?\u2019\u201d Er, no. Derulo cited \u201ca lot of picture-taking and that stuff\u201d as further proof that going through security like a normal person would be extra hassle for him. In fairness, he is a well-known pop star in the US. But unfortunately, no number of top 40 hits gives someone the power to trump the TSA\u2019s rules. After kicking up a fuss, he and his lot were asked to leave the plane \u2013 and he ended up taking a private jet to LA, as per an Instagram video he later uploaded. Derulo joins a healthy stable of musicians who\u2019ve found themselves involved in flight-related controversies \u2013 from Courtney Love to the Stone Roses\u2019 Ian Brown. Whether succumbing to the rage that air travel naturally inspires, or lurching through a near-crash, here are five of the best recent examples. Which would you add?  1. \u2018I\u2019m just trying to get to my fucking seat\u2019 Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong was chucked off a plane for refusing to hoist up his sagging trousers, in September 2011. According to an ABC producer, who happened to be on the same flight, Armstrong responded with, \u201cdon\u2019t you have better things to do than worry about that?\u201d when challenged by the flight attendant. Apparently not. When he failed to comply, Armstrong was shown the exit. His angry tweets about the incident only add to its delightful absurdity. 2. \u2018You\u2019re just a captain and I\u2019m REM\u2019 A decade earlier, REM guitarist Peter Buck felt the highs and lows of mixing wine and sleeping pills. On a British Airways flight from Seattle to London, Buck allegedly opened a yogurt pot all over himself and a flight attendant in a scuffle, sat down next to a woman in business class and claimed (wrongly) that she was his wife, overturned a food trolley and physically struggled with two members of in-flight staff. In the court testimony after the altercation, Buck was said to have told the captain \u2013 who came out of the cockpit to deal with the kerfuffle \u2013 that he was \u201cjust a fucking captain and I\u2019m REM\u201d. Whether or not that comparison holds any water, Buck was cleared of all charges in 2002. 3. \u2018Welcome to Bangkok\u2019 Don\u2019t mess with Bj\u00f6rk. The Icelandic musician and producer appears to be some sort of forest-dwelling nymph queen, but could clearly square up to anyone, if necessary. In 1996, a reporter learned this lesson the hard way. A quick \u201cwelcome to Bangkok\u201d in the city\u2019s international airport turned to blows and ended with people having to pull Bj\u00f6rk off the journalist. She\u2019d clearly had it with the press and paparazzi following her and her son around. In 2008, Bj\u00f6rk was also accused of ripping a paparazzo\u2019s shirt at Auckland airport. Like I said: leave this one, mate.         Bjork hitting a journalist at Bangkok international airport in 1996    4. \u2018A very nasty man tried to kill us all but we\u2019re all right now\u2019 A joyous post-Christmas flight this certainly was not. In December 2000, a \u201cmentally unstable man\u201d tried to commandeer an aircraft on the way from London to Nairobi. Bryan Ferry was among those on the flight \u2013 as well as Jemima Khan, who later wrote about her so-called \u201cplane porn\u201d obsession. The pilot issued the above statement after passengers helped staff bundle the man out of the cockpit. Don\u2019t worry, Ferry was in no way involved in the violent scuffle, though he did state the beautifully obvious upon arrival, saying: \u201cI\u2019m relieved to get here in one piece.\u201d 5. \u2018There\u2019s a serious lack of funny bones around here\u2019 Susan Boyle may not seem like the type to throw an airport hissy fit \u2013 because she didn\u2019t.

The Malaysian ringgit and Indonesian rupiah have been in freefall for months, and the Thai baht was haemorrhaging support long before the Bangkok shrine bombing. Figures showing that emerging markets have suffered a near-$1tn (\u00a3640bn) outflow of funds over the last year give another indication that countries billed as the stars of the post-crash economy are now waning. According to a compilation of official data and estimates by the investment bank NN Investment Partners, total net capital outflows from the 19 largest emerging market economies reached $940.2bn in the 13 months to the end of July.  The Netherlands-based bank said the figure was almost double the net outflow during the nine months following the 2008 banking collapse. Asia is not the only area to suffer. Turkey, Brazil and Mexico are among the other emerging economies to see capital flight back to the US and Europe. As their currencies shrink in value, it takes more cash to fund foreign debt payments in dollars. The report shows that emerging markets have spent vast portions of their foreign reserves to meet obligations that were much less onerous only a year before.    Emerging market reserves   Investors quitting emerging markets either sell property and stock market assets or simply take out and repatriate cash from local banks. If returned to the US, that cash might make a lower return but there will be less risk attached. Adding to the weakening picture, the latest survey of investor sentiment by Bank of America Merrill Lynch found that the threat of a recession in China and a broader emerging market debt crisis have eclipsed the eurozone\u2019s woes as principal concerns. Stock markets have tumbled in response. China has already suffered one calamitous crash this year and in recent days has appeared to be on the brink of another. A 6% plunge on Tuesday in the benchmark Shanghai Composite was followed by further 5% drop on Wednesday before a recovery pushed the index to finish 1.2% up at 3,794.11 points. The volatile nature of emerging market stocks and shares is not just a symptom of thin trading in August or speculators exaggerating market movements with their heavy bets. These factors probably play a part, but analysts have placed greater weight on global trade figures that show a slowdown over the last six months. Global trade declined by 8% between December 2014 and May 2015. It had previously recovered strongly since 2009, driven largely by emerging economies feeding off a China-induced stimulus to world trade. The momentum was lost last year, however, and a head of steam that saw a 40% rise in world trade over six years has vanished. China played a big part in the slowdown after the new political leadership in Beijing announced its determination to wean the economy off cheap borrowing that had fuelled a destabilising property boom.  Diana Choyleva, chief economist at Lombard Street Research and a China expert, pointed out in a report that a contraction in the money supply, led by a retreat in bank lending, illustrated how well the policy was working.  She said: \u201cBroad money growth, the best indicator of overall monetary conditions in an economy, has slowed to its lowest rate on record in recent months. Over the past few years the People\u2019s Bank of China [PBoC] has introduced an alphabet soup of new monetary policy tools, but the liquidity injected through these facilities has not been large.    Capital flows   \u201cNot only has the PBoC been sparing in doling out cash to the banks, but credit growth has remained fairly subdued \u2013 a stark contrast to 2009.\u201d She said the world was living through a deliberate rebalancing by the Chinese authorities that the west will have to accommodate in order for it to work. An overreaction in the form of competitive devaluations by the US or Japan would wreck China\u2019s efforts and bring further anxiety to world markets. The US is already pushing up the value of its currency with anticipation about a rise in domestic interest rates. The Federal Reserve could raise rates within the next couple of months, and though the higher rate is largely factored into currency markets, there will be another boost to the dollar when it happens.    Related: How a Fed rates rise creates issues for emerging markets    A second rise will probably knock emerging markets further, as the US becomes an even more attractive destination for investment funds. An expected hike in the UK, where Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, has signalled a move towards 2% starting in the spring, could intensify the pressure further. Some emerging economies will fare worse than others. Turkey\u2019s lira has lost around 20% of its value against the dollar so far this year, making it one of the worst performing emerging market currencies. An inconclusive election and its proximity to fighting in Syria have played their part in fuelling fears of economic turmoil, but the broader consideration is the hefty extra $3.8bn Ankara must pay on its energy import bill and the dependence of its major corporations on borrowed funds. These funds were borrowed in dollars and are increasingly expensive to finance. Higher interest rates in the US will make the situation worse. Earlier this week, the central bank left its base interest rate unchanged at 7.5%, despite ministers\u2019 clamour for a cut. The bank knows such a move would make investing in Turkey less attractive and accelerate the flow of funds out of the country. Countries that spurned cheap dollars in the aftermath of the crash are expected to be insulated from US rate rises. For Turkey and the rest it will be a rocky ride.", "publicationDate": "2015-08-19T19:36:14Z", "tags": ["Emerging markets", "Economics", "International trade", "Business", "Global economy", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Turkey", "Currencies"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/19/emerging-markets-shine-dims-as-capital-flight-nudges-1tn-in-a-year", "title": "Emerging markets' shine dims as capital flight nudges $1tn in a year", "sentences": ["The Malaysian ringgit and Indonesian rupiah have been in freefall for months, and the Thai baht was haemorrhaging support long before the Bangkok shrine bombing."]}, {"article": "Thailand has said international terror groups were unlikely to be behind the Bangkok shrine bombing as it appealed for Interpol\u2019s help in finding the man accused of being the prime suspect.

Related: Bangkok explosion: fatal blast at Erawan shrine    The claim by the country\u2019s police chief is the latest setback to a haphazard investigation in which police and politicians have released contradictory information. Days have passed with few new clues about who planned the country\u2019s deadliest bomb attack in recent history or why. The national police chief, Somyot Poompanmoung, told reporters that authorities also lacked high-tech equipment used on the popular TV crime series CSI to clarify blurry footage of the suspect, who was seen in grainy video dropping a bag at the scene of the blast minutes before the explosion. \u201cHave you seen CSI?\u201d Somyot asked reporters. \u201cWe don\u2019t have those things. \u201cThe perpetrator was driving away escaping and there are CCTV cameras following him. Sometimes there were 20 cameras on the street but only five worked. Fifteen were broken.

We believe that the lawsuit is entirely without merit, and we have taken significant measures to ensure that the practices that it describes are not a part of our business. We also want to make clear the systems we have in place to ensure our current and continued compliance with international standards and the strength of our resolve to eradicate any such practices from the Thai fishing industry. We only have contact with the Thai fishing industry in a few small areas, as we do not own or operate any fishmeal plants or fishing vessels. The allegations relate to fishmeal \u2013 a small and diminishing ingredient of the feedstock that we feed to the shrimp at our farms. We are committed to and have implemented steps to allow us to trace the origin of the fishmeal that we buy back to individual fishing vessels. Currently, fishmeal makes up around 10% of our shrimp farm feedstock, and our goal is to reduce it to 5% over the next five years. It is important to note that fishmeal is entirely made from material that would otherwise go to waste. The by-product fishmeal (made from trimmings during the preparation of large fish for human consumption) is certified to the recognised international benchmark for the sustainable usage of fishmeal. The by-catch (ie uneconomic fish caught by fishermen alongside their intended catch) portion of our fishmeal usage is subject to a traceability system that extends back to the fishmeal plants and original fishing vessels. We have also vastly reduced the number of suppliers to help ensure full visibility and traceability on sustainability and social issues. This traceability system will soon undergo an audit by a highly reputable international third-party audit firm. Shrimp farming is an important source of sustainable seafood for a growing world population. As a founding member of the Shrimp Sustainable Supply Chain Task Force, alongside international customers, Thai seafood industry peers and international non-governmental organisations, CP Foods is committed to driving further improvements at every stage of the Thai shrimp supply chain.

Even after he departed, I still endured hours of profanity-laden huffing. I finally got another Xanax down her neck, and things were calming down, when I plugged in the reading lamp next to the bed, and its dodgy wiring gave me a pretty nasty shock that knocked me to the ground. My mother whirled around and asked what happened. I saw a renewed storm of riad-manager-targeted wrath brewing in her narrowed eyes. I stammered: \u201cNothing, I tripped,\u201d and tried to mask the racing of my heart with nonchalant guidebook browsing. I actually endured electrocution rather than risk upsetting the delicate peace wrought by the Breakfast of Champions.HBall Locals torched our bungalow Last month, six of us went on an epic holiday to Vanuatu. Yep, that\u2019s the place in the South Pacific that got hammered by Hurricane Pam in March. And no, we didn\u2019t cancel our holiday \u2013 I mean, these things always look worse than they are, don\u2019t they? And you have to help these places get back on your feet, right? And after all, Vanuatu was recently rated as the \u201chappiest country in the world\u201d, so what could possibly go wrong? Well, anyway, we ended up staying at a lodge on Tanna, one of the southernmost islands in the Vanuatu archipelago \u2013 famous for its accessible volcano. We had a family bungalow right on the beach, lovely place, owned by a New Zealand businessman. Then \u2013 after a horrendous incident allegedly involving the businessman\u2019s son \u2013 one of the local lads on the island is stabbed, run over and killed. This prompted an understandably volcanic reaction from the Tanna islanders. The only warning we got was a fellow guest telling us that men with machetes and petrol cans were on their way, and we had 10 minutes to get out, maybe less. A world-record-breaking packing frenzy later, we watched brown smoke rise into the air from the back of a Toyota pick-up: us, our tearful kids, a few other ex-guests, and one shaken, utterly bewildered Kiwi.jimbomcnulty Cuban crisis  Three standout fails from my Latin adventure a few years ago.

On Monday, authorities issued arrest warrants for two suspects, a Thai woman and a man in his 40s, after a raid on another suburban apartment block uncovered possible bomb-making materials. In response to the attack, Thai citizens raised a similar sum of cash for information leading to the arrest of suspects involved in the blast \u2013 the most deadly peacetime bombing in the country.

The authorities have been criticised for releasing contradictory information in the days after the attack, speculating about differing motives and for rejecting offers of help from international investigators. The military junta, which took power in a coup in May 2014 after months of violent protests, has vowed to bring stability to the country and is looking to solve the case promptly, wary of the effects the uncertainty may have on its vital tourism industry. The prime suspect, whose face has appeared in a detailed electronic sketch, shows a thin man with a light complexion, wearing black-rimmed glasses. But he could have been wearing a disguise and the CCTV footage is of low quality. The sketch has been widely circulated in Thailand, including on roadside billboards. Immigration officers at Bangkok\u2019s international airport also have printouts of the digital sketch. Some show him without glasses, wearing a hat or with no hair. Thai media shared a photo on Tuesday of a Chinese passport they said belonged to the man arrested at the Cambodian border. It showed a similar-looking man to the person in the electronic sketch. The passport showed he was born in 1989 and came from China\u2019s western Xinjiang region.     Visitors pray as Thai classical dancers perform at the Erawan shrine on 1 September.

There has been speculation that Uighur militants were behind the bombing after Thailand forcibly returned 109 Uighurs to China in July. The deportations angered the Uighur community and caused an outcry from human rights groups and the UN, who said they could face persecution and abuse. Many Uighurs have fled to south-east Asia in the hope of then travelling to Turkey, which has strong cultural links to the group and has sheltered them for decades. Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute, said he remained sceptical about a link to the situation in Xinjiang. \u201cBut if it does turn out to be the case, it certainly would be quite a worrying escalation from a Chinese perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it turns out to be this, this is the first time we have seen such a blunt attack on Chinese nationals abroad by people who are angry about what is happening in Xinjiang.\u201d He said Beijing would also be likely to crack down further within its own borders \u2013 as it did after two deadly attacks on civilians in Kunming and Urumqi in 2014 \u2013 and to make it even harder for Uighurs to leave the country by fleeing to other countries in the region, including Thailand.

Wyn Ellis, who has been working for the United Nations, has been held at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport for four days over a years-old dispute with a former Thai official.

The two also clashed over the authorship of other work attributed to Supachai.

Ellis, an agricultural consultant who has worked with the UN\u2019s environmental programme, was the subject of nine legal complaints by Supachai, the former director of the Thai national innovation agency (NIA), but won or settled all of them. Supachai, for his part, was convicted of criminal forgery of Ellis\u2019s employment contract in 2012. He was fined and given a suspended prison sentence, and was sacked by the NIA in February.  But Ellis learned that, in 2009, Supachai had asked the Thai immigration department to blacklist him.

The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has joined the chorus of protests at his military detention. The Guardian reported on Monday that Pravit had been held after being summoned by representatives of Thailand\u2019s junta, known as the National Council for Peace and Order.  After disappearing inside army headquarters in Bangkok, reporters were told Pravit had been detained because of articles that \u201ccould cause confusion and misunderstandings\u201d and for \u201cpresenting information that is not in keeping with the (junta) guidelines promoting peace and order\u201d. It was therefore necessary, said a junta spokesman, for Pravit to undergo \u201cattitude adjustment\u201d. He has been held incommunicado. \u201cThe detention of Pravit Rojanaphruk is the strongest indication so far of the National Council for Peace and Order\u2019s intention to suppress critical comment about the way it is running Thailand,\u201d said Bob Dietz, CPJ\u2019s Asia programme coordinator. He called for his immediate release. Pravit has written stories criticising Thailand\u2019s l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 law and has been critical of the 2014 military coup. On Saturday (12 September), Pravit posted a tweet about a visit to his house by two military officers while he was out. The following day, in his last tweet before his detention, he wrote: \u201cFreedom can\u2019t be maintained if we\u2019re not willing to defend it\u201d. The Nation\u2019s editor-in-chief, Thepchai Yong, said of Pravit\u2019s detention that it amounted to \u201ca direct threat to press freedom\u201d, adding: \u201cIf the military believes he has done something wrong, there are normal legal channels to deal with it\u201d.

But his view is different from most professionals. His laptop is sat on a bamboo table. A white beach slopes gently into a cove of cobalt water, dotted here and there with long-tail boats. He is surrounded by the distinctive landscape of Ko Pha Ngan island in Thailand, all coconut palms and little hills. \u201cMy office for the day,\u201d Hodgson says. The freelance translator and illustrator also runs a language-based website, Lingo Bongo. Because he is not shackled to an office desk or subject to the whim of a manager, Hodgson has exploited his freedom and embraced digital nomadism: the idea that by using technology you can work from wherever you like. So far this has meant his regular home in Madrid, but equally he has gone to work in the Himalayan foothills, in Bangkok and Ko Pha Ngan island, famed for its hedonistic full moon parties and pristine scenery. \u201cI have always wanted to do it,\u201d Hodgson says, \u201cever since the internet began and I saw the first laptop.\u201d He adds that it has only become practical in the last five years thanks to advances in technology. For his trips, he\u2019s invested in a \u201cbullet-proof\u201d laptop that he tethers wirelessly to his smartphone. \u201cYou can get a phone card for about 50 euros (\u00a335),\u201d he says, \u201cthat gives excellent 4G coverage. In India and Thailand they have astonishing networks for mobile phones. It is easily as good, and probably better, than in rural England.\u201d Apart from a few software packages such as Skype, there is little else Hodgson needs except, perhaps, a steady supply of drinks from the bar. Hodgson\u2019s story epitomises a 21st century ideal \u2013 a way of life that is Jack Kerouac meets Richard Branson. Of the two French companies who send him daily translation work, he admits he has never met them in his life, yet their working relationship functions perfectly well and has endured for years. So with technology becoming more reliable and the lifestyle so enticing, is digital nomadism on the increase? Could it become a common way of working in the future? Lea Woodward is someone who has watched the growth of remote working from the start. Born in Hong Kong and educated at Warwick University, she initially took a job with Accenture in the City of London. But disillusioned with the corporate life she decided to set up a personal training business. When her husband, a graphic designer, was made redundant in 2005 they decided it was time for another change. \u201cI typed into Google, \u2018cheap places with good quality of life\u2019, and Panama kept coming up,\u201d she remembers. \u201cAt the time remote working was not common, but I bought a guide and we decided to go. We told our friends and family and they thought we were crazy.\u201d Woodward continued with her personal training work and moved into coaching too. \u201cI did lots of it on Skype,\u201d she says. \u201c[My husband] Jonathan did all his work via email.\u201d Their time in Panama marked the beginning of a remote working odyssey that took them to Buenos Aires, Grenada, Canada, Thailand, Turkey, Dubai, Hong Kong and South Africa. They worked throughout, making use of new social media technologies as they appeared. \u201cI kept a personal blog and it became very popular,\u201d she says, \u201cso I kept writing and eventually I decided to turn our experiences into an ebook about location independence\u201d.  Since they started their travels, Woodward is sure that many more people have taken up the same lifestyle. She says: \u201cThere is definitely a trend for remote working. Previously it was such a strange concept that you had to overcome that mind-set. That has been the big thing. The tech is there and it has been for some time and now you\u2019re getting companies like Buffer and Automattic which are 100% remote. They have 100-130 people in their organisations. There is also a big number of micro-entrepreneurs and people pulling together in co-working spaces or renting Airbnb in places like Ubud in Bali.\u201d But while remote working seems to be on the increase, we\u2019ve not experienced the massive shift that so many predicted. Woodward acknowledges this. \u201cMaking it work is hard,\u201d she says. \u201cRunning and growing a business alongside travelling and settling in and making new friends is very difficult.\u201d To make her ventures work she has been forced to be strict on the allocation of time. \u201cYou have to be even more disciplined and motivated. Instead of the park outside, you might have the beach, but sometimes you have to just get on with your work.\u201d   Related: Intelligent steps to future-proof your job against the robot revolution    Brenna Holeman, author of This Battered Suitcase, agrees. \u201cDigital nomadism isn\u2019t as easy as it has been advertised,\u201d she says. \u201cThe people I know who live that kind of lifestyle work extremely hard, and on top of that do very strange hours. They have to be online a lot. If you are taking your work with you \u2013 say you\u2019re a scuba instructor \u2013 then that is one thing. If you\u2019re planning to start from scratch and make your entire living from being a digital nomad, however, then it can be a tough slog. If it works out then great, you\u2019ve got the beach right outside. But it is difficult.\u201d The business community also have their doubts. There are questions of trust and team building, and also of the efficiency of someone who is based far away. Hodgson acknowledges that one of the most difficult issues is the different time zones. \u201cMost of the time I have to send a translation within 24 hours,\u201d he says. \u201cThen there are the fast jobs \u2013 those that tend to pay a bit more \u2013 and as Asia is about six hours ahead there is the worry that you\u2019ll have gone to the pub by the time that they come in.\u201d For both Woodward and Hodgson digital nomadism is coming to an end for now. The reason, Hodgson says, is that while the beach might be a few feet away, his friends are halfway around the world. \u201cIt\u2019s an idyllic and quiet place, but it\u2019s too solitary.\u201d Looking for a job?

Nowhere is this more obvious than over the distinctions between western concepts and practices in relation to freedom of speech and freedom of the press. This was made clear yet again by the refusal of printers in Thailand to publish the Tuesday issue of the New York Times in its territory.  Strict l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws in Thailand crimimalise those who are adjudged to have defamed or insulted members of the royal family. So a factual front-page NY Times article reporting that 87-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej is in declining health and that the succession is in doubt was deemed too sensitive to allow to appear in print. Thailand\u2019s ministry of information has form in terms of censorship. It has blocked blogs and news websites, including Mail Online, for articles that refer to the colourful private life of Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, who has been divorced and/or separated (no-one is sure which) from three wives. Over the past year, there has been a significant increase in l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 convictions. But they are hardly new. In 2002, a local distributor of the The Economist withheld its publication because it made an \u201cinappropriate\u201d reference to the monarchy.  The article stated that the crown prince was \u201cheld in much less esteem\u201d than his father and that \u201cBangkok gossips\u201d swapped tales about his lurid personal life.

There is a hip-hop in Hamilton, but there are a lot of other things, too, which reassures and comforts a conventional Broadway audience while also hopefully attracting and satisfying a more diverse group of spectators (diverse in age and race and aesthetic orientation) who are less gratified by traditional Broadway balladry. There\u2019s nods to the Beastie Boys and Biggie Smalls in here. But a lot of Sondheim and Kander and Ebb, too.  It\u2019s not that Miranda\u2019s isn\u2019t an original voice. It is. Wildly.

He grew up in Washington Heights, a multicultural enclave, passionate about both his parents\u2019 original cast recordings and the rap and salsa that were all around him. (He memorialized his neighborhood in his first Broadway musical, In the Heights.) The energy produced when he mingles these multiple genres is infectious and immediate.

Every so often there\u2019s a crossover hit, Let the Sunshine In or (God help us) One Night in Bangkok.            That\u2019s probably not the case here. The songs, for better or for worse, are too enmeshed in character and history to stand alone. I can\u2019t really see the terrific Cabinet Battle #1 (\u201cMadison, you\u2019re mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine. / Damn, you\u2019re in worse shape than the national debt is in!\u201d) burning up the request line on Hot 97. Hamilton can be enjoyed by both the musical theater geek and the rap aficionado, but it ultimately has more to offer the former. It won\u2019t be changing the face of hip-hop.   Related: Fall theater preview: big names aren't just on Broadway this year     But could it change the face of Broadway? I think it can and I hope it will. Though maybe not soon. Certainly nothing else in the lineup for the coming season takes such chances in terms of genre and contemporary sound, though Shuffle Along draws from jazz and On Your Feet! \u2013 based on the music of Gloria Estefan \u2013 has a Latin sound. Actually there is one musical, Gotta Dance, that includes hip-hop, but it is about retirees who want to dance for the NBA, so massive innovation seems unlikely.  Maybe Hamilton isn\u2019t really a hip-hop show, or at least not exclusively a hip-hop show, but it proves that audiences will respond to a broader range of music than most producers would have thought possible and that its cast, which is almost entirely non-white, will not discourage a Broadway audience from engaging with the story. There\u2019s nothing niche about it, which the slew of Tonys it seems destined to win will almost certainly confirm. It holds out hope that the music on the stage could have more to do with the music we hear in our cars or in the clubs.  Now that\u2019s revolutionary.

The reality at the more popular tourist sites is often starkly different: greasy approximations of western food, stands hawking crass English-sloganed T-shirts, and a 7-Eleven on every corner. With 24.7 million international visitors in 2014 and one of the most developed hospitality industries in Asia, Thailand is no longer the region\u2019s most adventurous destination.   Thailand islands map     But don\u2019t be discouraged. This is still a country of raw natural beauty \u2013 and while it does take extra effort to reach the less-trampled pockets, it does not take much. Venture past Phuket, Phi Phi and Koh Phangan to these greener pastures, where the pace of life is still somnolent and the scenery still stunning. Unlike more developed areas, with their bevy of creature comforts, these destinations are rougher around the edges. Remote islands often lack ATMs; Wi-Fi is nonfunctional or nonexistent. It\u2019s a small price to pay for a trip off the well-trodden grid, and you\u2019ll find emerald rainforests and beaches without a soul in sight. ISLANDS Koh Kradan     Sevenseas Resort    Named \u201csurfboard\u201d in Thai for its elongated shape, this 2\u00bd-mile strip of land in the Andaman Sea off the coast of Trang province makes nearby Koh Lanta look positively packed. It is mostly within Hat Chao Mai national park, which means there are no villages or even proper roads to intrude on your Crusoe fantasies. Stay on the cashew-tree-fringed main beach, then make your way at sunset to Ao Chonglom, an isolated stretch on the western side with craggy limestone outcrops, or hop on a longtail boat to neighbouring Koh Muk for a spot of caving at Tham Morakot, the famed Emerald Cave. Where to stay With an open-air spa and 39 villas, Sevenseas Resort Koh Kradan (doubles from \u00a380) is a pretty plush place to be marooned. On a budget? Kalume Kradan Village (bungalow doubles from \u00a329) offers low-impact, no-frills accommodation by the sea. There\u2019s no air-con, but a fan and the gentle sea breeze provide ample climate control. Where to eat Minimal development means that the only restaurants on the island are connected with guesthouses or small resorts. Sevenseas Restaurant, which offer Thai and international dishes, is located directly by the water and remains one of the best of the bunch.  Getting there Fly from Bangkok to Trang with Nok Air (from \u00a310), then take a ferry from Hat Yao Pier (\u00a319 for the one-hour trip). Koh Phra Thong      Few places are more paradisical than this island towards the Myanmar border, which is a favoured nesting place of three species of sea turtle, including the world\u2019s largest, the 700kg leatherback. From November to January, these visitors lay their eggs in the protected sands. The few resorts cluster on the west coast, leaving vast swathes of grassland and biodiverse mangroves undisturbed. Listen for the unnervingly human-sounding cackle of sapphire-hued oriental hornbills, or the rustle of demur sambar deer. Protected and uninhabited, nearby Koh Ra is a haven for the area\u2019s wildlife. Where to stay There\u2019s a clutch of eco-savvy resorts here, but Golden Buddha Resort (doubles from \u00a390) stands out for its commitment to maintaining the fragile surroundings. The resort uses an energy-efficient generator, grows much of its own organic produce, and, along with the Phuket Marine Biological Centre and voluntourism group Naucrates, runs a turtle conservation centre where guests are welcome to lend a hand.   Related: Thailand's last unspoilt islands: Koh Yao Noi    Where to eat With no notable standalone restaurants here, your best bet by far is the dining room at Golden Buddha Resort, where the owners make their own bread and jams. In keeping with its environmental sensibilities, the resort grows its own organic fruit, herbs and vegetables, in addition to sustainably raising pigs, ducks and chickens. The remaining produce and seafood on the menu is sourced from the daily market in nearby Kuraburi and local fishermen. Getting there Fly from Bangkok to Phuket with Nok Air (from \u00a310), then either take a taxi, hire a car or arrange with the resort for a transfer to the pier at Kuraburi. Golden Buddha Resort has its own boats, which are more reliable than the local ferry. Koh Mak      Barely a blip on anyone\u2019s radar, this speck in the Koh Chang chain, in the eastern Gulf of Thailand, is perfect for doing a whole lot of nothing. Coconut palms number in the thousands and humans in the hundreds. If you\u2019re ambitious there are a few fishing villages to explore, and if motivation strikes, you might splash around in near-bath temperature seas. With a good book and hammock, though, you might be tempted not to bother at all. Where to stay Bungalows for two at family-owned Lazy Day the Resort (from \u00a329) are not fancy, but they are mere steps from the waves. Where to eat The humble Koh Mak Seafood (Ao Nid Bay) offers exactly the kind of unfussy cuisine you want on a tropical island. Getting there Fly from Bangkok to Trat with Bangkok Airways (from \u00a349) then take a 45-minute ferry ride (\u00a38, kohmakboat.com) from Laem Ngop. Koh Kood      Tourism has been rising steeply on this white-sand wonder since the addition of a high-speed ferry and a five-star resort, Soneva Kiri, a few years ago. Still, with no public transport and blessedly few bucket bars, its idyllic pockets are many. Ao Klong Chao is the island\u2019s most popular beach, but Ao Phrao in the south is a near-empty strip of equally lovely coast. Divers can head half an hour out to Koh Rang national park, where gin-clear waters and rainbows of coral await. BB Divers (full-day snorkelling with lunch \u00a318, full-day diving with lunch \u00a355) has experienced instructors and guides. Where to stay Cham\u2019s House (doubles from \u00a394) has plenty of beachfront villas, with open-air bathtubs. Where to eat As its name suggests, the vista from View Point Caf\u00e9 (on Had Klong Chao Road) will keep shutterbugs busy. This casual cafe closes for the rainy season in May and reopens in October. While no one would call the island a nightlife hub, Bombyx Beach Bar, part of the Chams House resort complex, is one of the liveliest places for a sundowner. For a glimpse of the island life of yesteryear, head to the quiet fishing village near Ao Yai beach and eat at Chonticha Seafood, where everything on the menu is fresh off the boat. Getting there Fly from Bangkok to Trat with Bangkok Airways (from \u00a349) then take the 90-minute Boonsiri ferry (from \u00a37) from Laem Sok. Koh Phayam          How this island of glittering sand and tropical forest has remained so sleepy for so long is a minor miracle. With a population of roughly 500 and just a smattering of bungalows, Koh Phayam is often likened to the Samui of yesteryear, before the cruise ships came in droves. Word is slowly creeping out, though, and each season sees a few more footprints in the powdery crescent of Buffalo Bay. Get here while the laid-back vibe remains. Where to stay: PP Land Eco Resort (bungalows for two from \u00a315), on Ao Hin Khao beach, and the same organisation\u2019s Heaven Beach Resort (bungalows for two from \u00a337) on Buffalo Bay come with luxuries like air-conditioning. The latter is family-friendly while the former is quieter and has a strict no-children policy. Where to eat Follow the rainbow sign to Baan Nam Cha, a hippyish vegetarian restaurant by Ao Yai Beach that stays true to the island\u2019s boho spirit and offers fresh juices (about \u00a31.50), vegan and gluten-free baked goods, chai tea, plus Thai and Burmese dishes. Getting there: Fly from Bangkok to Ranong with Nok Air (from \u00a310), then take a two-hour ferry ride (\u00a34) or the speedboat (\u00a36, 40 minutes, November-April only) to the island. Koh Tarutao      Less pleasant aspects of Koh Tarutao\u2019s history have helped deter the kind of mass tourism that has inundated nearby Koh Lipe. Previously a hideout for marauding pirates, a brutal prison for more than 3,000 exiled Thais, and, more recently, home to dim-witted contestants on US reality TV show Survivor: Thailand, this island close to Malaysia\u2019s Langkawi is part of the Tarutao national marine park and as such remains virtually free of commercial development and 70% blanketed in jungle. Its name comes from the Malay word for \u201cprimitive\u201d and \u201cmysterious\u201d \u2013 and indeed there is a lingering air of enigma on these mostly vacant shores and cave-riddled peaks. Where to stay Accommodation here is mostly on Ao Phante Malaka and Ao Molae beaches, and run by the national marine park (bungalows from \u00a311). These are basic beach shacks, but with a setting like this, you\u2019re not likely to care one bit. Where to eat: Dining options are limited, but perfectly adequate. Near the visitor centre at Ao Phante Malaka, there are a handful of bare-bones cafes that will whip up a wok of phat khao phat thalay (seafood fried rice) or other staples for little more than \u00a32. Getting there: Fly from Bangkok to Hat Yai with Nok Air (from \u00a310) then take a taxi to Pak Bara village, where you can catch the two-hour ferry (\u00a36) to the island. Foreign visitors have to pay a park entrance fee of about \u00a34. GREEN SPACES Khao Sok national park     Our Jungle House    The largest area of virgin forest in southern Thailand, this is a place of towering limestone karsts slicing through dense foliage that\u2019s home to great hornbills and Dobby-eyed slow lorises. Lucky visitors may spy some of the rare large mammals that live here, including the tapir and lumbering Asian bison. Cheow Lan Lake, in its centre, teems with aquatic life and is punctuated by more than 100 little islands. It may look peaceful, but its glassy surface conceals abandoned temples and villages flooded when the government created a dam nearby. Hikers can take a guided trek through the natural surroundings, and divers can explore the eerie remnants of drowned communities. Where to stay Treehouse hotels are hardly a rarity in Thailand, but the rustic-luxe Our Jungle House (treehouse doubles from \u00a353), on 25 privately owned acres of rainforest next to the Klong Sok river, is a fantastic place for explorers of all ages to stay. Where to eat Aside from the local guesthouses, most of which include a basic restaurant, Thai Herb, on the main park road, serves basics (from about \u00a31) such as phad krapow moo (spicy stir-fried pork with holy basil) and the ubiquitous pak boong fai daeng (stir-fried morning glory) in a shady garden setting. Getting there: Fly from Bangkok to Surat Thani with Nok Air (from \u00a310), then take a two-hour bus or minivan ride from the main station. Foreigner visitors have to pay a park fee of about \u00a38. Mae Hong Son     Wat Phra That Doi Kong Mu is a short hike from Mae Hong Son town. Photograph: Alamy    Surrounded by rolling tea plantations, Mae Hong Son town remains lush and languid in comparison with Pai, its increasingly overrun neighbour. Its proximity to the border means the Shan minority group (ethnically from Myanmar) make up much of the town\u2019s population. As with many places where culinary cultures clash, Mae Hong Son\u2019s distinctive local cuisine more than merits a trek. Seek out turmeric-tinted curries dotted with tiny, sour tomatoes and eaten with fingerfuls of sticky rice. You can hike up to Wat Phra That Doi Kong Mu, on a 1,500-metre peak just outside Mae Hong Son, is strenuous, but the two shimmering chedi spires and jaw-dropping view more than merit the effort.  Where to stay Fern Resort (doubles from \u00a346) consists of 30 Shan-style bungalows out in the lush and serene valley a few miles south of town. Where to eat The Salween River Restaurant (mains from about \u00a31.20, 23 Pradit Chong Kham Road) caters for travellers, but has solid Thai and Burmese dishes. For a more local experience, skip the sit-down meal and head to the daily morning market near Panith Wattana, or the evening one near the golden spires of Wat Chong Kham, for edible treats such as khanom jeen naam ngiaw (rice noodles with pork curry broth), Shan-style tofu and papaya fritters. Getting there The drive from Chiang Mai to Mae Hong Son is a scenic one (five hours by taxi, seven by bus), but budget carrier Kan Air  offers daily flights between the two destinations from \u00a317. Khao Yai national park     Escape Khao Ya offers modern accommodation just outside the national park. Photograph: Kittipong Thamapa    A short drive from Bangkok, Thailand\u2019s first national park, part of a larger Unesco-protected forest range, is a verdant expanse of mountains, evergreen and rainforests, and towering waterfalls including Haew Nerok, one of the highest in the country, and Haew Suat, made famous by Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s cliffside plunge in the movie The Beach. The 837-square-mile expanse brims with fauna ranging from the wild elephants and macaques to rare barking deer and gibbons, not to mention 300 species of tropical bird. Where to stay: Once home to only the most rudimentary of accommodation, the park has seen a flurry of boutique openings in recent years, making it even more appealing. Escape Khao Yai (doubles from \u00a354) has modern rooms right outside the park. Where to eat: Once the butt of jokes, Thailand\u2019s nascent wine industry is beginning to produce some moderately respectable vintages. It\u2019s hardly Bordeaux, but on the north side of the park, PB Valley Khao Yai Winery, one of the oldest and best vineyards in the country, makes for a scenic stop, and its Great Hornbill Grill does wood-fired pizzas as well as Thai food. Getting there Either rent a car for the 2\u00bd-hour drive from the capital or take a 3\u00bd-hour bus ride from Bangkok\u2019s Mo Chit station to Pak Chong. Foreign visitors have to pay a park entrance fee of about \u00a37. Doi Inthanon national park      Crowned by 2,565-metre Doi Inthanon, the highest peak in Thailand, this sanctuary is wreathed in pinewoods and sprinkled with wild orchids. An ornithologist\u2019s dream, it is home to the largest number of bird species in the country. The park\u2019s uncommonly cool temperatures, as well as its proximity to Chiang Mai (it\u2019s 100km away), the largest city in northern Thailand, means it lures the occasional busload of vacationing locals. Escape the gradually growing throngs by tackling the short but strenuous climb to the top rather than driving straight to the viewpoint. Where to stay Although basic park accommodation is available around the park, there are far more options in Chiang Mai. Crash at the new Akyra Manor Chiang Mai (doubles from \u00a390) on a buzzy street west of the centre to enjoy some serious creature comforts before venturing into the wilderness. Where to eat Accommodation near the park tends to have a basic restaurant catering for tour buses and groups. For something a notch better, head to SP Chicken (Samlan Road Soi 1), a simple restaurant in the historic centre of Chiang Mai, where the gai yaang (grilled chicken, about \u00a32) is roasted on a spit over coals and served with a mouth-scorching dip.

Bao Zhuoxuan, the son of detained lawyer Wang Yu, had planned to meet human rights activists in Thailand last Sunday after slipping out of China across its south-western border with Myanmar, the Guardian understands. The 16-year-old, whose Chinese passport was confiscated following his mother\u2019s detention earlier this year, had intended to request asylum at the US embassy in Bangkok. A family in San Francisco had agreed to care for the teenager, whose father, Bao Longjun, is also currently in the custody of Chinese security services. But Bao failed to turn up at the agreed rendezvous point in the Thai capital. On Thursday, after days without news, activists learned uniformed officers had taken Bao and two Chinese travel companions from a hotel in Mong La, a notorious border town near Myanmar\u2019s border with China, two days earlier.  Zhou Fengsuo, a San Francisco-based human rights activist involved in the teenager\u2019s attempt to escape, said it was not clear if Bao remained in Myanmar or had been returned to China. \u201cThis is like my worst nightmare,\u201d said Zhou, who had been in Thailand to meet Bao but has now returned to the US.  \u201cI am very worried about their safety and I want to know where they are. This is so frustrating. He is just a boy. He should not have to go through this. His parents are both in prison and he is under constant surveillance. \u201cAll we want is for him to be able to have a peaceful life here in the US and to be able to go to school. It is so devastating.\u201d Bao\u2019s mother, Wang Yu, has not been seen since she was taken from their Beijing home by security agents in the early hours of 9 July. She was the first of dozens of lawyers and activists to be detained as part of a co-ordinated operation against China\u2019s outspoken community of human rights lawyers. Nearly 300 lawyers and activists have been detained or questioned since the crackdown began. Speaking earlier this year, before her detention, Wang said: \u201cNobody is safe under a dictatorship.\u201d Beijing\u2019s crackdown, which experts say is designed to wipe out any opposition to President Xi Jinping and the Communist party he leads, has sparked international condemnation. \u201cHuman rights and rule of law have suffered a devastating blow since president Xi Jinping came to power,\u201d Marco Rubio, the US presidential hopeful, said this week, pointing to Beijing\u2019s offensives against Christian churches and lawyers such as Wang Yu. \u201cA government that does not respect the rights and basic dignity of its own people cannot be assumed to be a responsible actor in the global arena,\u201d Rubio added. William Nee, a Hong Kong-based activist for Amnesty International, said Bao\u2019s detention signalled China\u2019s crackdown had spread beyond its borders.

This is changing. Furano, in Hokkaido, has until now been very strict, but going off-piste is now tolerated, and piste exit point signs have been added to indicate backcountry areas. Contact a local guide at journeyintojapan.com.au/furano Two US resorts become one       Photograph: Dan Campbell Photography    Two of the US\u2019s premium resorts are joining together in holy matrimony this winter to create America\u2019s biggest ski area. Funky Park City (which hosts the Sundance film festival in January and has a wild west base with saloon bars) and nearby The Canyons (extensive and varied but with a soulless purpose-built resort village) are both in Utah and both owned by Vail Resorts. Together they\u2019ll be known just as Park City (parkcity.com) and will have a new interconnecting gondola.\u2022 The pick of Utah ski resorts  Sleep in an igloo, France          Village Igloo de Blacksheep (from \u20ac99pp in a five-person igloo, blacksheep-igloo.com) at Le Dou du Praz above La Plagne Village in Savoie is one of a growing number of igloo collections in the Alps. This one has been constructed from snow again this season, with the addition of an igloo chapel, where couples can propose (or pray for a warmer bed), though not actually get hitched. High-speed rail link to the Alps      The new Eurostar service (eurostar.com) from London to Lyon (from \u00a389 return) makes rail access to some Alpine resorts easier this winter. The direct train runs on Saturdays through the winter, taking 4h40m, and from Lyon there are direct connecting trains to other towns and cities just a taxi ride from top resorts. Connections include Annecy for the Aravis Valley, Grenoble for Alpe d\u2019Huez, Sallanches for Meg\u00e8ve, Saint Gervais-Les-Bains for St Gervais and Les Contamines, and Modane for Val Cenis. Fresh runs in the Pyrenees     The Val de Neu hotel, Baqueria-Beret. Photograph: Per Rueda    In the Spanish Pyrenees, the budget-friendly resort of Baqueira-Beret is among many resorts turning 50 this winter (also Jackson Hole and Whistler). To celebrate it has added 21 runs to its ski area, increasing the total pistes from 120km to 146km. Even its only five-star hotel, the Val de Neu, offers good value, and has a champagne bar, kids\u2019 restaurant, spa and pool. Carrier (carrier.co.uk/destinations) has a week there from \u00a3740pp low season (early December and April), including flights and breakfast. Smaller Catalonian resort La Molina, which was Spain\u2019s first and connects to Masella to offer 122km of slopes, also has new runs, and the biggest half-pipe in the Pyrenees. A taste of Asia in Austria     Ping Coombes    Ping Coombes, the 2014 Masterchef champion, has been recruited by upmarket operator Scott Dunn (scottdunn.com) to design this year\u2019s chalet menus, giving a pan-Asian/Malaysian theme to all dishes, from pre-dinner nibbles to the kids\u2019 menu. Laksa soup and chocolate cake with black sesame ice-cream will make a change from spag bol. The operator\u2019s cheapest trips are to St Anton, Austria, where a week including flights, half-board and in-resort driver at Lodge Bodensee (with hot tub) costs from \u00a31,100pp based on full chalet occupancy (sleeps 10).  Extra gondola for Tyrol       Photograph: Andorfer    The Tyrolean resort of Obergurgl-Hochgurgl gets a spanking new gondola this autumn, the Top Mountain Crosspoint. The curvaceous wooden structure is a cracking piece or architecture \u2013 and surely the only lift station in the world that is also home to a museum \u2013 of motorbikes \u2013 as well as a restaurant. Ski Total (skitotal.com) has a week in one of Obergurgl\u2019s few chalets, Chalet Angela, from \u00a3564pp half-board, including flights. Craft breweries hit new heights     Snake River Brewery at Jackson Hole    Even ski resorts can\u2019t escape the craft beer revolution, and there\u2019s been a definite upswing in the number of high-altitude breweries, many with bars offering an alternative kind of apr\u00e8s ski. Not surprisingly, the US has a ton of them, including the Snake River Brewery, with bar and restaurant attached, in Jackson Hole, Wyoming (which, incidentally, is getting the mega new Teton Lift, to open up 200 acres of intermediate and advanced terrain in The Crags, previously only reached by hiking). Grimm Brothers in sweet locals\u2019 hill Loveland, Colorado, has a tap room open 1pm-9pm for beery apr\u00e8s ski sessions, and Telluride Brewing Co, in the awesome Colorado mega resort, has a tap room open at weekends. Closer to home, newcomer the Bec Jaune Brewery in Morzine, produces IPAs, English malts and French and German-style beers on site, and its restaurant does pulled pork buns and vegan superfood burgers. Wine week, France          A traditional, family-friendly French resort little more than an hour from Geneva, and connecting to Sixt, Morillon and Flaine, Samoens will be particularly attractive from 13-18 January for La Semaine Vigneronne, a wine growers\u2019 event that sees 20 producers from all over France visiting and offering tastings.

In a brief statement which did not reveal details, the ethics committee said the suspension was \u201con the grounds that a breach of [Fifa\u2019s] code of ethics appears to have been committed\u201d. Makudi becomes the ninth of Fifa\u2019s 24 executive committee members before the December 2010 vote for the hosts of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to have since been either banned or suspended following misconduct allegations. Two more, Nicol\u00e1s Leoz of Paraguay and Ricardo Teixeira of Brazil, resigned before being exposed for having taken bribes. The former FA chairman Lord Triesman alleged under parliamentary privilege that during England\u2019s 2018 bid Makudi personally asked for the TV rights of a friendly Thailand and England were negotiating to play. An FA report by the barrister James Dingemans QC did not uphold that allegation but found the FA was negotiating to keep only the UK rights for the game, and give the Thai FA worldwide rights, rather than only the domestic rights in Thailand, which would have been normal. A lawyer acting for Makudi has said he will immediately appeal. Football Association of Thailand lawyer, Narinpong Jinapak, issued a statement saying FIFA\u2019s order was not final and an appeal would be sent immediately. \u201cI have no idea why Fifa issued such suspension order which relatively defames my reputation,\u201d Worawi was quoted as saying in Thai newspapers. \u201cI will have the legal team send a petition to Fifa immediately under my rights. According to Thai laws, this case is not final. I\u2019m still entitled to do local activities.\u201d Fifa\u2019s president Sepp Blatter said in 2011 that \u201cthere are no elements in this report which would prompt any proceedings\u201d by Fifa\u2019s ethics committee, and Jerome Valcke, the organisation\u2019s secretary-general, said the executive committee members named in it had come out \u201ccompletely clean\u201d. However, the Dingemans report was subsequently followed up by the former US prosecutor Michael Garcia, in his ethics committee inquiry into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding process. The summary of Garcia\u2019s report by Hans-Joachim Eckert, the chairman of the \u201cadjudicatory,\u201d sanctions-setting branch of the ethics committee, stated that in fact there were \u201cample\u201d grounds for investigation of wrongdoing. \u201cInformation compiled in the Dingemans investigation and supplemented during the [ethics committee\u2019s] own inquiry established a prima facie case that serious violations of bidding rules and the Fifa code of ethics have occurred in the contexts concerned,\u201d Eckert\u2019s summary stated. Eckert said three of the four Fifa executive committee members concerned in the Dingemans report had \u201cmade improper requests for support or favors [sic] towards the England 2018 bid team and/or the FA during the bidding process.\u201d The report dealt with allegations about requests made by Makudi, Jack Warner of Trinidad, Leoz and Teixeira. Eckert said the Dingemans report \u201cpresented ample evidence with respect to certain allegations to warrant the initiation of Fifa ethics committee proceedings against selected individuals.\u201d However it did not specify which three of the four executive committee members it was referring to. The investigation of Makudi by the ethics committee did follow the Garcia report. Makudi was a Fifa executive committee member for 18 years until May this year. In July, he was found guilty of forgery in his 2013 re-election bid to lead the Thai football association. A Bangkok criminal court sentenced him to a suspended jail term of one year and four months.

It is his fourth autobiography, but it barely takes him up to 1997, so it is safe to assume there are a few more volumes in him yet. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than Harry Potter,\u201d he admits. He says he was only going to do one book, but by the time he had checked the word count on the first, he had only got to Paul at 17. He just really likes detail. And what detail it is: the 60-year-old presenter of a teatime chatshow and a weekly programme about rescue dogs has some wild stories to tell. The clubs. The pubs. The night Eartha Kitt stole his makeup backstage at Butlins in Skegness. The bacchanalian 40th birthday party at the Savoy which turned into \u201cSodom and Gomorrah\u201d. The time he swallowed a lump of hash he had found in his pocket at Bangkok customs, so as not to get caught with it. The deaths. You can see why the previous instalments have been bestsellers. Things seem to happen to O\u2019Grady that don\u2019t befall your typical daytime talkshow host. I don\u2019t recall Alan Titchmarsh in full drag whipping a German man for \u00a3500 because his electricity bill was overdue. It\u2019s strange that O\u2019Grady is so mainstream now, because he was never the mainstream type. After decades on the London pub drag circuit, his Lily Savage character finally broke through in Edinburgh, which landed him a handful of TV jobs, including a year-long stint on 90s morning show The Big Breakfast. Lily made him a household name, but she wasn\u2019t exactly PG. \u201cShe was a prostitute, a single mother, a shoplifter, she openly took drugs \u2026\u201d He giggles at the memory. \u201cShe was a drinker, she had a dysfunctional family, she had a racing whippet called Queenie, her granddaughter, Kylie Marie. And she was religious, so make sense of that!\u201d He has come a long way since Lily\u2019s heyday. He retired her in 2004 (she returned for a cameo in Paul O\u2019Grady\u2019s Little Cracker, short Christmas ghost story in 2012, but he has no plans to bring her back again), and has established himself as the down-to-earth, no-nonsense voice of ITV, with a sideline in documentaries about animals. We are meeting in a fancy room in the central London headquarters of Olga TV, the production company he set up in 2005. He looks ordinary in a V-neck jumper, shirt and slacks. He lives in Kent now, mostly, with his long-term partner, on a farm they share with five dogs (\u201ctwo epileptics, one\u2019s getting over cancer, one\u2019s got arthritis and an eye ulcer, and one thinks he\u2019s Napoleon\u201d). We talk for an hour, and it\u2019s mostly a hoot, all razzle-dazzle anecdotes in those Lambert &amp; Butler-streaked tones. It\u2019s only listening back to the recording that I realise how tired he sounds. \u201cI\u2019ve got six pigs. Eight sheep,\u201d he says, continuing the animal inventory. \u201cMy favourite sheep died while I was away. What a rotten year it\u2019s been! Cilla, and then, while I was in Borneo, I saw it on the telly \u2013 Jackie Collins. I only spoke to her before I left. We were going to have lunch, and I said, \u2018I can\u2019t, I\u2019m going away \u2026\u2019\u201d     With Cilla Black at a wedding in 2008. Photograph: Fred Duval/WireImage    O\u2019Grady delivered a hilarious eulogy at Cilla Black\u2019s funeral in August, about how they used to go clubbing in New York together, to working-class Latino gay bars, where he would stick her jewellery in his pocket. He brings her up often today. He says her death fills him with regret. \u201cRegret of a friendship that\u2019s gone. Maybe regret\u2019s the wrong word. Sadness, really, because you\u2019ve lost a big chunk of your life. It\u2019s like the fun\u2019s taken away from you.\u201d He gets glassy-eyed recalling the times they spent together. \u201cShe\u2019d come in in the morning, in the dressing gown with her mug and a piece of toast balanced on top: \u2018Do you want a cup of tea, Paul?\u2019 It was all very normal and I miss that. I miss her companionship and I miss her advice. It\u2019s that feeling of loss. It\u2019s dreadful feeling.\u201d He mentions Cilla briefly in the introduction to his new book, but only to explain why she isn\u2019t in it. \u201cOur time together would take at least a couple of volumes to do her justice,\u201d he writes. But Jackie Collins appears intermittently, as it was finished before she died in September. \u201cI\u2019m scared to write about anybody! I feel like the Grim Reaper with a pen. It was such a shock. She was wonderful, Jackie. Full of life. Unbelievable.\u201d He mentions another friend, Paul Cottingham, who died in 2014. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone down like ninepins.\u201d For all the uproarious, seedy glamour of Open the Cage, Murphy \u2013 the title refers to what is best described as a battle cry, delivered to his long-time manager and partner whenever something big was about to happen \u2013 it is simultaneously haunted by death and loss. \u201cI\u2019ve lost just about everybody I know,\u201d he says \u2013 Cilla, Jackie, his friends in the drag community, and Murphy, too, who died of a brain tumour in 2005.   Related: Paul O'Grady: a class act in more ways than one | Observer profile    \u201cI\u2019ve been used to it,\u201d he says, matter of factly. \u201cWhen Aids hit London, it wiped out all of my friends. And you\u2019d nurse them as well, and you\u2019d have to break the news to their families, that they\u2019ve got Aids, and the stigma surrounding it at the time \u2026 \u2018We\u2019ll say he\u2019s got cancer.\u2019 As if that was easier. But, to be honest with you, this year, I feel battered by it. Battered.\u201d He sits back in his chair and, for a second, looks defeated. He remembers nursing his friend Chrissie, who was dying in hospital, \u201cin the early days, when they were testing the meds. They put him on extra-strong medication. And he said: \u2018You can\u2019t sit there, Jesus is there.\u2019 And there\u2019s his mother. And Joan of Arc. It became perfectly acceptable to me to be having tea with Francis Drake. I just went along with it. It was like improv.\u201d How else does a comic deal with a desperate situation, other than with humour? \u201cI\u2019ll never forget a guy who used to dance with paper fans. They were a bloody nuisance, to tell you the truth, and he said, oh, they\u2019re not cool any more. And I said, \u2018What is?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Dying.\u2019 I\u2019ll never forget that, in the kitchen of Westminster hospital, scraping the ice-cream off me that Chrissie had thrown.\u201d Have the younger generations forgotten about the Aids crisis? \u201cI think they have. People of my age, we\u2019ll never get over the horrors. We never will.\u201d He says he\u2019s making a documentary about the Salvation Army \u2013 with his Catholic upbringing, they\u2019re \u201cstrange bedfellows, but we get on like a house on fire\u201d \u2013 because they did so much work on the Aids wards in the 80s and 90s. \u201cI\u2019m joining the band! I\u2019m on the drums, going down Oxford Street in the full gear. My mother would be turning in her grave. She\u2019d be kicking the lid off.\u201d O\u2019Grady is contrary, but he seems to relish it. He will talk about his love of the Salvation Army, of old women in cafes, of people on the bus, of the volunteers at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, of pagans and witches. But, recounting a horrific story of orangutan abuse \u2013 he is just back from Borneo, where he has been making a documentary \u2013 he will then declare emphatically that he hates people. \u201cI hate bloody humanity. I seriously do. We have a beautiful planet and we\u2019re just bloody destroying it. I\u2019ve stopped watching the news and I\u2019ve stopped reading the papers because it\u2019s too depressing. What\u2019s going on? It\u2019s horrific, isn\u2019t it?\u201d     O\u2019Grady as Lily Savage in 2000. Photograph: ITV/Rex Shutterstock/ITV/REX Shutterstock    In May, O\u2019Grady said he would leave Britain and move to Venice if the Conservatives won the general election. \u201cI had visions of me sitting on the Lido, till I saw the property prices,\u201d he says now. \u201cNot only that, it\u2019s freezing for half of the year. And I can\u2019t speak a word of Italian.\u201d But along came Jeremy Corbyn, who has given him some hope, at least. \u201cBecause he came along when the Labour party was in the doldrums and were a wishy-washy lot. I\u2019m not interested in them. This man comes along and says, no, we need social housing, we have to be a more caring society. Thank God somebody has come along and said it. It doesn\u2019t matter if he can\u2019t win. How do we know he can\u2019t win? Just because he\u2019s not in a Savile Row suit with the slick haircut!\u201d Why does he think people voted for a Conservative majority? \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely blinded. They listen to this guff from Osborne \u2013 dreadful man. And Cameron \u2013 ugh! I loathe them,\u201d he hisses. \u201cThey have no idea how normal people live, and how they try to manage. They see us all as Jeremy Kyle.\u201d Despite the farmhouse in Kent, despite our surroundings now or in the production company he owns, he still says \u201cus all\u201d. Is he still working class? \u201cVery much so. I know that probably sounds strange. Mentally, I still am. I\u2019m still thinking, have I got the rent for Friday?\u201d He won\u2019t have a cleaner. He doesn\u2019t like the thought of someone being in his house. But it\u2019s not because he\u2019s cheap. \u201cI remember I was out with Jackie Collins once, shopping, and she was looking at a handbag, one of these tiny things. I said: \u2018What are you going to put in that?\u2019 It was thousands of dollars. She said: \u2018I\u2019m not paying that.\u2019 And I said: \u2018Are you thrifty?\u2019 And she said: \u2018No, but I\u2019m not a mug.\u2019 And I knew exactly what she meant. You go on Mr Porter or whatever and you think, \u00a32,000 for a sweater? Are you out of your mind? One wash and it wouldn\u2019t fit a dog.\u201d O\u2019Grady says one of the reasons he never goes out now is that he would spend the week worrying what he should wear. \u201cI\u2019m terrified of being mutton dressed as lamb.\u201d He says gentrification has ruined pubs. \u201cAny pub that says they do gastro food and children are welcome \u2013 that\u2019s not a pub!\u201d he roars. \u201cA pub should smell of cigarette smoke, booze, with a nice old barmaid who reeks of perfume, who\u2019s been there all her life.\u201d But mainly, he says, waving his hand, \u201cCan\u2019t be bothered. Soho can breathe a sigh of relief. When I had the first heart attack, Murphy walked down Old Compton Street and he said every nightclub bouncer, every hooker, every homeless person, said, \u2018How\u2019s Savage?\u2019 He said: \u2018What have you been up to?\u2019 But you do have to change your ways. You move to Kent. You make candles. You make jam.\u201d What flavour jam? \u201cStrawberry. Cos I\u2019ve got an allotment. You get a surplus. But I hate jam! I\u2019ve still got pots from 10 years ago. This is what you\u2019re reduced to in the country.\u201d Despite his talk of being over it, it sounds as if he still misses the pubs, the nightlife. \u201cI do. Very much.\u201d He seems sad again. But like he says, it has been a rotten year. I ask if he thinks he is going to be all right. \u201cOh God, yeah,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m very resilient, me. I\u2019ve had three heart attacks. I\u2019ll go and lick my wounds. I\u2019ll do what we all do in Birkenhead and I\u2019ll take to my bed. You know when you\u2019ve had enough? You go, that\u2019s it, I\u2019m taking to my bed, flaming.\u201d He smiles. \u201cThen I\u2019m up again a couple of hours later.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 13 October 2015 to correct the date of Cilla Black\u2019s funeral. \u2022 To order a copy of Open the Cage, Murphy by Paul O\u2019Grady for \u00a314 (RRP \u00a320), go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

Club Church (Kerkstraat 52) is a cruise club aimed at males, while the bar Vivelavie (Amstelstraat 7) is probably the most popular venue for lesbians. TrellBurton Edinburgh     94DR, Edinburgh    I stayed at the gorgeous 94DR guest house-hotel-boutique B&amp;B with my other half and our lesbian friends. First, it is stylish and luxurious and everything you wish for in a B&amp;B. Second, the location is perfect for the Scottish capital, being near Arthur\u2019s Seat and the Royal Mile. Third, it is perfect for LGBT couples and friends. The warm welcome of the owners and hosts is great \u2013 getting it just right between enthusiastic suggestions and leaving you in peace to enjoy your holiday. Of course, Edinburgh itself is a great gay-friendly city \u2013 and the owners gave us great tips on bars and spots to visit. Definitely tap them for their local knowledge. We loved Edinburgh and this truly fabulous base just made the trip. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a380 B&amp;B, 94dr.comrachbrown Rio de Janeiro     Banda de Ipanema. Photograph: Alamy    For a beach and party scene, Rio is unbeatable. We visited during the carnival, five days of flamboyant debauchery that takes over the city. Every neighbourhood has its own bloco \u2013 free street parties offering visitors an opportunity to experience carnival like a local. The Banda de Ipanema bloco attracts a huge and friendly gay crowd, while around the arches in Lapa there is a smaller, more bohemian scene. We recuperated at a gay beach \u2013 Ipanema Farme \u2013 a great place for people watching and queijo coalho (hot cheese on a stick) snacks.ID090252 Barcelona     Metro Disco, Barcelona    Beautiful beaches, amazing architecture and naughty nightlife \u2026 Barcelona has it all. Spend a day walking the city, taking in the sights: the Sagrada Familia, Parc G\u00fcell and the amazing Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana. Have a late tapas dinner at Casa Jaime, which is just a short walk from Atame, a fun, vibrant gay bar usually with a drag queen cabaret. Finish the night dancing in Metro Disco, a gay nightclub with added extras. The following day, recover by taking a short train ride to Sitges and spend the day lounging and people-watching on Platja Bassa Rodona, a popular gay beach brimming with bronzed bodies.Terry Buzec Bangkok     Thailand is one of the more tolerant countries in south-east Asia towards LGBT couples. Photograph: Corbis    Having lived in there for the best part of two years, I got a real sense of why Thailand is considered to be one of the most forward and gay-friendly countries in Asia. There is a real feeling of warmth and acceptance from the Thai people. Although it is not the Thai custom to overly express affection, especially in public, this is no different for same-sex couples as for opposite-sex couples. Bangkok has many hot-spots in the Sukhumvit road and Silom areas where you can eat, drink and dance to your heart\u2019s content in venues aimed at the LGBT community. In short, Thailand is a place where you can truly be free to be yourself.basilbus66 Tel Aviv     Hilton beach, Tel Aviv. Photograph: Alamy    Tel Aviv may not conjure up visions of dazzling nightlife, hip restaurants, stylish boutiques, and busy streets hopping with clubs and cafes \u2013 all of which are all inclusive and gay-friendly. But this vibrant city is an undisputed queer capital of the Middle East. It offers a huge array of gay attractions. I love going to Hilton beach, taking in the sights that the sea and sand have to offer (including bronzed six-packs). At night, Rothschild Boulevard is where gay and straight people mingle amid trendy eateries and stylish sculptures. Make sure to check out Rustico, a fantastic Italian restaurant with a great atmosphere and even greater food.jamesleestevens\u2022 Why Tel Aviv is among the world\u2019s most gay-friendly cities  Chongqing, China     Karaoke bars and restaurants in Chongqing. Photograph: Corbis    Usually seen only from the deck of a Yangtze river cruise, the pink-tinged capital of China\u2019s south-west merits a longer stay for the LGBT traveller. Chongqing offers a break from carbon copy clubs, regimented tours and the hermetically sealed backpackers\u2019 bubble, whether it\u2019s happening upon a gay cinema-themed cafe in scenic Ciqikou old town, sampling hotpot with the locals after a night of cabaret in Shangqingsi, or simply finding a tranquil spot in the mountains to enjoy a cup of tea and a game of mahjong. Getting off the beaten track doesn\u2019t have to mean getting back in the closet.gra1302 Reykjavik     A gay pride parade in Reykjavik.

As the country that had the world\u2019s first out lesbian prime minister, J\u00f3hanna Sigur\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir, Iceland welcomes one and all. We stayed at the reasonably priced White Swan guesthouse. There\u2019s lots to see and do: whale watching, the Blue Lagoon, Gullfoss waterfall, geysers \u2013 all set in magical landscapes. Visit during the Rainbow Festival in late January and you may well see the northern lights. The Rainbow Reykjavik website has lots of information for LGBT people.NeetieNoots Copenhagen     Preparations for gay pride under way in Rainbow square, Copenhagen. Photograph: Corbis    Of all of the places I have been, Copenhagen has to be the most LGBT-friendly. After all, Denmark was one of the first countries in the world to do same-sex registered partnerships. Definitely worth a visit is what is said to be Europe\u2019s oldest gay bar, Centralhjornet, where there are amazing cocktails and a lot of fun. Another place to visit is Rainbow Square, which used to be called Town Hall square but has been renamed by the city council to honour the LGBT community. With lots of amazing LGBT accommodation and events to celebrate equality and the LGBT community, Copenhagen is a must.Cerys John", "publicationDate": "2015-10-15T05:30:09Z", "tags": ["Gay and lesbian travel", "Travel"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/oct/15/lgbt-lesbian-gay-travel-tips", "title": "LGBT-friendly cities, hotels, restaurants and clubs: readers\u2019 travel tips", "sentences": ["The following day, recover by taking a short train ride to Sitges and spend the day lounging and people-watching on Platja Bassa Rodona, a popular gay beach brimming with bronzed bodies.Terry Buzec Bangkok     Thailand is one of the more tolerant countries in south-east Asia towards LGBT couples.", "Bangkok has many hot-spots in the Sukhumvit road and Silom areas where you can eat, drink and dance to your heart\u2019s content in venues aimed at the LGBT community."]}, {"article": "Are some cities more stressful than others? Places such as Cairo and Mumbai are often cited as exceptionally noisy, busy, overwhelming metropolises. But many city dwellers across the world will make a case for why their own urban environment causes so much stress \u2013 from transport nightmares and lack of greenery to high costs and social anonymity.  You shared your thoughts, stories and experiences of what makes cities stressful, which places are most stressful and which succeed in being anxiety-free. Here\u2019s a selection of what you said.  What makes a city stressful?  For me the worst thing is pollution. I hate breathing in diesel fumes every day. Then there\u2019s the way living in such large numbers anonymises people and gives them a \u201cnot my problem\u201d attitude. Littering, spitting in the street, vandalism, not caring for your streets or parks or public spaces, noise pollution, etc. These are things that are far more likely in a city than in a small village. (justask)   Reduce the traffic in cities: driving into the city is idiocy, it really isn\u2019t a necessity for most people. I\u2019ve always thought the height of human idiocy has to be owning a parking space in a city, to the tune of \u00a350K or more, while humans live on the street. We can do better but our visions are limited by the elite who insist on convenience which in the end will inconvenience most of humanity. (Bluejil)   Is it the cities themselves that are causing such misery, or is it more accurately attributed to socio-economic situation? I\u2019d wager that a millionaire in Cairo, living in a plush, spacious home, travelling in air-conditioned luxury, would be less stressed out by their environment than a taxi driver or a beggar struggling to feed their family. (ncfcyellowman)   What exactly stresses you out? What about mortgages? I live in Mexico City where car traffic is on the verge of total breakdown. It\u2019s chaotic and noisy, and stressful indeed. On the other hand, in Sweden (where I grew up) I see my friends being completely stressed out paying their mortgage. Whereas I, in dirty noisy Mexico City, and no mortgage or rent to pay, have 10 GBP of monthly expenses for my housing, for water, electricity and gas. That gives me an enormous freedom. (Martin Thulin)      Traffic in Mexico City. Photograph: Herv Hughes/Hemis/Corbis     The main thing that affects my stress level is just constant jostling. Jostling on trains, tubes, buses, on escalators, crossing roads, pedestrian crossings, lifts, at lunch time, in supermarkets, coffee shops, traffic jams etc. It just seems like everyone is in such a rush and pushing other people is just a way of showing how important you are. If we all relaxed we\u2019d get there 2 minutes later but happier. (PrakashShah)   Stress, in cities, is all about self-preservation. You have to keep on jumping out of the way of traffic or people. If the vehicle traffic factor can be eliminated from city life, then stress is substantially reduced. Open space is absolutely essential for reduction in stress, depression and so on. (spitnswordus)   Pace of life, sense of claustrophobia (lack of space), lack of greenery, crowds, pollution, constant consumer lifestyle, being constantly under the scrutiny of strangers, the weariness of dealing with many strangers; as soon as I escape to the countryside I feel much lighter and happier. (Mikesh Patel)   I find that big cities suck away the ability to think truly independently. Too many people, too many other thoughts and things being said which interfere with one\u2019s own creativity. (hogarth1)  Although others disagree:  I\u2019ve found the exact opposite to be the case. I knocked out several bestsellers while sitting on the balcony of my old apartment in the middle of Bangkok, but put me in the countryside and my brain turns to mush. (KeithTaylor)      Traffic in Jakarta. Photograph: Donal Husni/Demotix/Corbis    Which cities are stressful \u2013 and which aren\u2019t?  I lived in Cairo (Zamelek, Mohandiseen) for a year. Even on night trips on the near-deserted airport road, taxi drivers used to sound their horns every thirty seconds or so, with no traffic anywhere near. I asked the driver why drivers used their horns so much. He replied that most (i.e. all except rich) Caireans were born and raised in noise, with traffic, cheap, dense housing and hearing the neighbours through the walls. He said it was almost like breathing for him and that he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable without noise.  I left on a summers day to relocate to Madrid, the city half-empty, the other half at the beach. Peace, quiet, green spaces; a different world. When the locals complain about the traffic, I suggest they take a few days out of Europe for a comparison. (mrunderhll)   Jakarta for me, just for the traffic, was mind-boggling! (Maharaja Brovinda Singh)   The worst city I have ever been to has got to be Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. There are no pavements, footpaths, no walkways or flyovers for pedestrians. The roads are constantly congested with countless cars and trucks. No one follows the rules of the roads, there are so many traffic accidents that I would lose count going to and from work. (Filmitsonshine)      Traffic in Riyadh. Photograph: Alamy     The most stressful place I have ever lived is Singapore, without a doubt. People have no concept of allowing others to pass beside them on the footpath \u2013 assuming you can find a spare inch on the footpath amongst the teeming hordes; traffic is rampant, the MRT always overcrowded, nobody looks where they\u2019re going because they are too busy reading phones, noise of traffic and strange food smells, stifling heat and commercial pressure from advertising everywhere. (eggbert17)   Zero mention of street harassment in Cairo, which any woman will tell you is by far the biggest stressor there. Any of us would take double the pollution, traffic and noise put together in exchange for a reduction in harassment, which studies have shown affects 97% of women on a regular basis. (TrulyMadlyAmanda)   My memories of commuting in London revolve around running. I would leave my home in a north London council estate at five to seven and sprint to the nearest bus stop that was about half a mile away. I would just catch the bus which took me to the station, jump off the bus before the stop and sprint up the hill to the station and leap down the stairs to the 7:14 which would be just about to depart. I would arrive in St Pancras station at 7:30.  I would then sprint through the station and bound down the countless number of stairs into the underground labyrinth that is Kings Cross/St Pancras station and catch a Metropolitan Line train to Bromley by Bow, catch me breath before sprinting out of the station down St Leonards Road to the factory gate (it was quicker to run than take the bus) and I\u2019d clock in at 7:58. Stressed? I would be if I did it today. (Old_Lion)      Commuters at Kings Cross tube station. Photograph: David Levene     I lived in Shanghai for six months and it was not stressful. Why? Because a subway rail station is never far away. And the trains are every 3 minutes. Terribly different in Manila. The 3 distinct lines do not share the same interchange stations. It\u2019s a 20 minute walk between stations to change lines. (mediashit)   Malta isn\u2019t in the same league as Cairo and Mumbai but it\u2019s poorly developed and jammed with traffic, very noisy. There\u2019s little greenery so, having moved there recently, I\u2019m hoping the sea takes some of the stress out of living there. (simonsaint)   I would cite Vancouver as one of the least stressful cities I have ever visited. Wonderfully situated between mountains and the sea with good urban spaces, and easy access to walks, and the sea. (BigBear2)   I didn\u2019t detect a lot of stress in Copenhagen. I then came back to London and instantly felt my heart tense up and my brain hurt. I have decided there is an optimum size for a city and it\u2019s a heck of a lot smaller than 8.5 million people ... At 500,000 people and a metro area of circa 1.5 million, Copenhagen is clean, works like clockwork and makes London look like the dirty, miserable heaving mass it is. (boomblastandruin)      Less stress? The waterfront of Nyhavn Canal in Copenhagen. Photograph: Alamy     I\u2019d suggest Copenhagen is a city which has relatively lower levels of stress. Yes it\u2019s small, with the highest taxes and not much cheap coffee, but the bigger things which have been proven to combat long-term stress can be found \u2013 a high-degree of economic equality, high levels of trust as well as frequent socialising in groups. There are also lots of superficial factors that lead to lower stress: easier commutes (biking), green spaces and independent shops over large chains (helps a place not feel anonymous, perhaps). This isn\u2019t a city possible to be replicated everywhere, but I think it\u2019s an interesting example of how cities in Europe and beyond could take ideas from in future urban planning. (Alice Barker)   I\u2019ve commuted on the Central Line in London at 7.30am many times. Sure, it\u2019s crowded, but it\u2019s fast, efficient, and it gets you across town pretty quickly to where you want to go. Everyone on the train realises we are all in the same boat, and people are generally considerate. Let me tell you that waiting at a suburban station in Sydney for 45 minutes for the next train is far more aggravating than moving swiftly through a tunnel towards your destination, even if it is crowded for 20 minutes until you get past Bank. (yoghurt2)   Even within cities there are areas which cause greater stress than others; in the three years since my workplace shifted from the Aldwych to the bustle of Oxford Street my stress levels have risen and my health has declined. I miss the refuges of calm, the Temple fountain, Somerset House, Embankment Garden, places where a 10 minute break resets the adrenalin counter for the day. (Horatio93)      Rural peace: the Lake District. Photograph: Robert Harding Picture Library L/Alamy    Time to escape? Many suggested the cure to all this urban stress was, by definition, relocating to be surrounded by nature in the countryside:  I have a house in the countryside surrounded by woods and mountains. Nearest neighbour is half a mile away. I just spent five days there, taking photos of the nature and listening rain drops on the leaves and drainpipe. (pfcbg)  But others disagreed:  I just escaped the countryside after 12 years and am delightedly gulping in diesel fumes. Never again!

There is no legal way to beat the house at Las Vegas. But according to a widely respected investment website, used by tens of thousands of small investors, there is a simple way to beat the stock market. Here\u2019s how: you put a lump sum into shares at the beginning of November, then you sell it at the end of April. And that\u2019s it. Can it really be that simple? According to Interactive Investor, the firm behind this claim, it really is. It says that starting with \u00a3100 in 1995, someone who had invested in the market continuously for the past 20 years would have seen their money grow by 100% to \u00a3200 (excluding dividends). However, if they had invested only between 1 November and 30 April every year, then that \u00a3100 would be worth significantly more at \u00a3316 \u2013 an increase of 216%. Conversely, if they had chosen only to invest over the summer they would have lost: their original \u00a3100 would be worth just \u00a369. Over 10 years it holds true, too. It suggests that the message put out for years by fund management groups \u2013 to \u201cdrip-feed\u201d your money into the market month by month, to gain from \u201cpound cost averaging\u201d \u2013 is simply wrong. \u201cThe evidence is quite compelling,\u201d says Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t buy in to the entire strategy of being out of the market for six months, you may be better off increasing your exposure to higher-risk stocks over the winter months and investing in more defensive stocks over the summer.\u201d In some ways this analysis is the equal and opposite of that decades-old stock market adage, \u201csell in May and go away\u201d. London stockbrokers would sell their portfolios ahead of their long summer holidays in the south of France, then buy on their return. Markets would fall when portfolios were liquidated, then rise again in autumn. In a world of computerised high-frequency trading, when billions change hands in seconds, it all sounds absurdly simplistic. The research covers 20 years, but that\u2019s an unusually short period for stock market history. Excluding the summer months since 1995 means that investors avoided the two major downturns: the dotcom bubble, which burst in March 2000 and sent shares plummeting, and the more recent global financial crisis which wrought heavy damage on stock markets in the summer of 2008. But the stock market history books do show a weirdly high number of crashes in October. The most famous, the Wall Street crash of 1929, started on 24 October, while our own 1987 \u201cBlack Monday\u201d was on 19 October. Extraordinarily, seven out of the 10 largest percentage falls in the history of the FTSE 100 have all occurred during an October (and, gulp, we still have 14 days left). Why is this? I\u2019m not convinced it has much to do with the seasonal Isa flows, which are insignificant compared to global hot money movements. I have every respect for Interactive Investors\u2019 research. But what I do know is that if anyone promises you a foolproof way to make easy money, in general they are nearly always wrong. Unless, that is, they told you to buy London property. But one day, even that gravity-defier must join tulips and the dotcoms in the history of financial crashes. \u2022 Is this the cheapest-ever air ticket? I\u2019m toying with an extended holiday to the Far East in February. Air China will fly me from London to Beijing for a few days, then I fly to Bangkok. I\u2019ll overland to Kuala Lumpur, then fly back with Air China to London. The price for all 24,000 km-worth of flights? Just \u00a3347, of which \u00a3300 is tax.

Guerrero was eight-and-a half months pregnant when she arrived 10 days earlier at Texas\u2019 Wichita County jail. The medical malpractice lawsuit Guerrero has filed \u2013 against the county, the jail\u2019s healthcare contractor, Correctional Healthcare Management, and one of the jail\u2019s nurses, LaDonna Anderson \u2013 claims she began experiencing lower back pain, cramps, heavy vaginal discharge and bleeding on 11 June. The nurse on duty told her there was no cause for concern until she had bled through two sanitary napkins. Several painful hours later, Guerrero pushed the medical emergency button in her cell. More than four hours later, Guerrero was finally taken to the nurse\u2019s station, where she says she showed Anderson her used sanitary pads filled with blood and fluids, but was not examined. Instead, she was taken to a one-person holding cell with no toilet, sink or emergency call button, known as the \u201ccage\u201d. At 5am, her water broke. She called out to Anderson, but, Guerrero says, the nurse refused to check on her. Shortly after, Guerrero felt her daughter\u2019s head breach. A passing guard stopped to assist her, and Guerrero gave birth. The baby was dark purple and unresponsive, with the umbilical cord wrapped around her neck. When Anderson arrived minutes later, she did not attempt to revive the baby, Guerrero says. The EMTs got there after 20 minutes and rushed the baby to the hospital, as Guerrero remained in the cage and delivered the placenta. The baby was pronounced dead at 6.30am. No data, no problem The number of women who cycle through US jails is increasing by approximately 1.6% each year, to 109,100 in 2014, while the number of women in prisons has risen nearly tenfold in the past 40 years, to 111,300 in 2013.  There is no current data on how many of those women are pregnant. In 2004, a Bureau of Justice Statistics survey found that 3% of women in federal prisons and 4% of those in state prisons were pregnant upon arrival. The statistics on pregnancy in local jails is older \u2013 a 2002 survey found that 5% of women entered local jails pregnant. At those rates, approximately 9,430 pregnant women are incarcerated annually. There is even less data on what kind of medical care pregnant prisoners receive. In a six-month investigation, In These Times reached out to dozens of incarcerated women, activists and advocates, seeking to reach women who had been pregnant behind bars. Twelve came forward to share their stories. Many said they\u2019d received no medical care or experienced long waits. Most had been constantly hungry. Others were restrained during labor, delivery or postpartum recovery, even in states that ban the practice. And the majority of those who gave birth in custody had their infants taken away within 48 hours. The dangerous lack of medical care that Guerrero alleges is not unusual in US jails or prisons. Bridgette Gibbs says that, despite telling staff of her history of miscarriages, she received no medical attention in her two months of pregnancy at the Westchester County jail in New York. She still hadn\u2019t been examined when, early in her second trimester, she went into labor. Before being taken to the hospital, she was strip-searched and shackled at the hands, waist and ankles. She gave birth to twins while handcuffed to a bed, and was still handcuffed hours later when she learned that her premature newborns had died. The hospital told her that the early labor had been the result of a treatable infection. The Westchester County department of correction could not confirm or deny her story, saying that it no longer has Gibbs\u2019s records. In Arizona, complaints about prison medical care prompted the ACLU and the Prison Law Office to file a class-action suit in 2012. An accompanying investigation uncovered two incidents in the summer of 2013 when officials at the state prison in Perryville dismissed women\u2019s claims that they were going into labor. One woman said that it took two hours to convince the guards to transport her to the hospital. She gave birth 20 minutes after arrival. The other said nurses refused to believe her water had broken even after it tested positive for amniotic fluid. Officers sent her to the hospital only when she began screaming. \u2018It hurts to be hungry like that\u2019 Pregnant women especially need nutrient-rich food. Nutritional deficits can, for example, increase the risk of gestational diabetes, which can cause a fetus\u2019s trunk and shoulders to become too big for vaginal birth. They can also increase the risk of diabetes later in life for both mother and child.  In jails and prisons, meal times, foods and portions are limited. More than half of the dozen women interviewed by In These Times recalled an overwhelming, unrelenting hunger. \u201cWithholding healthy food from a pregnant woman is withholding medical care,\u201d says Tess Timoney, a certified nurse-midwife and director of women\u2019s HIV services at New York\u2019s Bronx-Lebanon hospital. Minna Long, 23, was pregnant with twins when she entered the Clark County jail in Washington state in 2010. She received an extra eight-ounce carton of milk with all three meals, but, she recalls: \u201cThere were countless times the milk was expired and sour and I couldn\u2019t drink it.\u201d Her pregnancy also caused her to feel revulsion toward many of the foods served. During her four months in jail, she subsisted on milk, fruit and cold cereal, as well as commissary purchases of donuts, candy, trail mix, meat and cheese sticks, and flavored popcorn. Even when nutrition and medical care are adequate, the restrictions and confinement inherent in prisons can make pregnancy and birthing traumatic. It is standard policy in US prisons and jails to strip-search prisoners upon entering and exiting, including a squat and cough, with no exceptions for pregnant or postpartum women. Sierra Watts, 37, was incarcerated in Washington state just after a ban on shackling incarcerated women during childbirth went into effect. But she learned first-hand that such laws aren\u2019t always followed. While she was allowed to give birth without restraints, she was subsequently cuffed to the bed. Her son was placed in a cradle next to her. \u201cI just had to lean over to get him out, but it\u2019s harder when you can\u2019t move that far,\u201d she says. The Washington state department of corrections says that \u201ca post-incident review determined she was not supposed to be cuffed\u201d. For Watts, the worst part wasn\u2019t the shackling, but what followed. Although she had granted her mother temporary guardianship, child welfare workers told her that they would not send the infant to live with his grandmother. After spending 24 hours with her newborn, Watts was taken back to prison without knowing her son\u2019s fate. Because he was born on a Friday, he was to remain in the hospital until child welfare offices opened on Monday. \u201cHe was going to stay in the hospital with nobody holding him, nobody knows where he\u2019s going, nobody\u2019s even going to tell me where he\u2019s going,\u201d Watts says, her eyes filling with tears.  She did not learn where he was placed until the following Tuesday. The next \u2013 and last \u2013 time she saw him in person was during a prison visit one year later, shortly before he was adopted. Under the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act, if a child is in foster care for 15 of 22 months, the state must begin proceedings to terminate parental rights. Watts says that she initially fought to maintain custody, but finally signed away her rights.  \u201cThey told me that if I was to take it to trial and lose, then I wouldn\u2019t be able to get photos or hear how he\u2019s doing or send him cards or anything,\u201d she says. As a condition of the adoption, she receives photos of her son, now aged three, several times a year. But there is no requirement that she be allowed to have contact with the boy, and so she never sees or speaks to him. That\u2019s relatively common for incarcerated women who give birth\u037e two other women interviewed by In These Times arranged for their babies to be adopted. At the Washington Corrections Center for Women, incarcerating each woman costs $44,400 per year. Sierra Watts was sentenced to 40 months. What if the $148,000 spent to imprison her had instead been spent to help her stay out of the prison system? The UN Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders, known as the Bangkok Rules, recommend that for a pregnant woman or a child\u2019s primary caregiver, \u201cnon-custodial measures should be preferred where possible and appropriate\u201d. But pregnancy and parenting are rarely taken into consideration in the US legal system.  A few cities and states, however, have recognized that maternal incarceration can devastate children and are exploring alternatives. In November 2014, the Delaware department of correction created New Expectations, a group home for pregnant women with drug addictions who would otherwise be imprisoned. The home provides meals, prenatal vitamins, clothing, toys, intensive substance abuse counseling, and classes on infant care, parenting, breastfeeding, nutrition and budgeting. But the facility is run by the department of correction and its healthcare provider, Connections Community Support Programs, and the doors are locked and alarmed. By contrast, New York City\u2019s Drew House and JusticeHome operate independently of the prison system. To be eligible, mothers must plead guilty to felony charges \u2013 but the charges are dismissed once they complete the program.  In the meantime, they avoid prison, and their children avoid foster care. Olgita Blackwood\u2019s youngest child was barely a week old when she was arrested. \u201cI was so worried about my kids,\u201d she told the Associated Press. \u201cThey depend on me. They asked for me every day.\u201d The 24-year-old was sent to Drew House, enabling her to stay with her three children. Nearly two years later, as she prepared to take her GED, she said that the program made her independent. \u201cI can make decisions on my own, raise my kids.

Now, the Biomimicry Institute, a Montana-based nonprofit, is taking the trend a step further with its new Food Systems Design Challenge, encouraging a cadre of entrepreneurs to improve the food production system by emulating techniques and processes found in nature. At the SXSW Eco conference earlier this month, the institute announced the eight finalists in the challenge. \u201cWe want to help foster bringing more biomimetic designs to market \u2026 to show that biomimicry is a viable and essential design methodology to create a more regenerative and sustainable world,\u201d said Megan Schuknect, the institute\u2019s director of design challenges. Just as natural processes often benefit multiple stakeholders, many competitors in the challenge are seeking to solve multiple problems. BioX, a finalist team from Bangkok, hopes to increase food security while helping users secure a steady source of income. On the outside, BioX\u2019s product, Jube, looks like a decorative hanging vase. Inside, it\u2019s a bug trap that catches protein-rich edible insects. Lined with inward-pointing hairs that move insects downward and keep them from escaping, it mimics the structure of a pitcher plant. \u201cThe product is designed to be artistic and crafted so that people in any community can make it and sell it to other people as an alternative source of revenue,\u201d said Pat Pataranutaporn at the SXSW Eco Conference. Each vase is decorated with multicolored patterns designed to copy the plants\u2019 mix of mottled colors. \u201cWe believe that we can spread biomimicry through culture and art,\u201d Pataranutaporn said. Easing into commercialization By 2030, bioinspired innovations could generate $1.6tn of GDP worldwide, according to a 2013 report from Point Loma University\u2019s Fermanian Business and Economic Institute. Another report from sustainable design firm Terrapin Bright Green, found companies that use biomimicry can reap greater revenues and have lower costs than those that don\u2019t. For years, large companies have increasingly employed biomimicry to solve difficult engineering challenges. Qualcomm\u2019s Mirasol electronic device display imitates the light-reflective structure of a butterfly wing and uses a tenth of the power of an LCD reader, while Sprint worked with the San Diego Zoo\u2019s Center for Bioinspiration to design more environmentally friendly packaging. But developing biomimetic designs could be a steeper challenge for smaller companies. Tech startups have an estimated 90% fail rate, and biomimetic companies are no exception. \u201cBioinspired innovation faces the same challenges as other forms of innovation \u2013 years of research, design and development, financial risk and market acceptance,\u201d Terrapin Bright Green spokesperson Allison Bernett told the Guardian. \u201cAs they face increasingly rigorous testing and financial constraints, fewer technologies progress into the prototype and development stages, a typical pattern in product development.\u201d However, Bernett added, biomimetics can reduce the costs and difficulties of development. \u201cExtensive prior research, a thorough understanding and a functioning model \u2013 with the living organism providing the \u2018blueprint\u2019 \u2013 can benefit a technology\u2019s development costs by speeding up the R&amp;D process,\u201d she said.  The lessons of biomimicry could even extend to market politics. Portland-based business advisor Faye Yoshihara said that the disruptive nature of bioinspired products can be seen as a threat to entrenched competitors\u2019 interests. \u201cMarket entrants need to identify mutually beneficial ways of working with industry players and points of entry into an ecosystem,\u201d she told the Guardian. Alternately, Yoshihara suggested, biomimetic firms could imitate the protected environments that encourage weaker species. \u201cInnovators must sometimes create their own ecosystems to get their product or service to market,\u201d she said. With that in mind, the Biomimicry Institute has developed a business accelerator to help the competition\u2019s finalists move their designs from the concept phase to the pre-commercialization stage. Over six to nine months, the program will give qualifying companies training and mentorship from experts such as Yoshihara. Six-sided efficiency Hexagro, another challenge finalist, has combined agriculture with the design genius of one of nature\u2019s most famous structures. A modular aeroponic home-growing system, it is made up of individual hexagon-shaped bins that are inspired by bees\u2019 honeycombs. Designer Felipe Hernandez Villa-Roel wanted his product to circumvent some of the environmental problems associated with large scale agriculture, such as carbon emissions, pesticide use and fertilizer runoff. His solution was to make it easier for people living in small urban spaces to grow pesticide-free food at home.  \u201cI wanted to solve this problem as efficiently as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd since many people can\u2019t spend the time to garden, it needed to be something that wouldn\u2019t take up a lot of personal time.\u201d  The bins \u2013 which can grow lettuce, carrots, cilantro, spinach, herbs and even potatoes \u2013 evoke the resource efficiency of a beehive. They can be stacked to fit any available space. And, because the plants\u2019 roots are in the air, they can be misted with a nutrient solution placed on an automatic cycle. Hernandez Villa-Roel claims that his pods can cut down water use by 90% compared to traditional farming.  The designer hopes that Hexagro could help decentralize food production and provide an economic opportunity for growers, who can sell their excess produce. He envisions a community of growers and distributors bringing locally grown produce to market, cutting down on the CO2 emissions commonly associated with food transportation.  \u201cThis system could also be used in Syrian refugee camps to grow food, or with the disabled or elderly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe social consequences of this project are much greater than the project itself.\u201d Taking it underground A team of students from the landscape architecture department at the University of Oregon in Eugene designed the Living Filtration System, an agricultural tool that imitates filtration processes used throughout nature. Designed to reduce fertilizer and chemical runoff from farms, the system is a new spin on traditional tile drainage systems designed to remove excess moisture from the surface of the soil. \u201cA [drainage] pipe made out of renewable material that mimics an earthworm\u2019s villi to slow down runoff is one of the major components,\u201d said Wade Hanson, a member of the team.  The students say that their drainage system also incorporates the mechanism used by wetlands to filter pollutants from water. Next fall, they will join the seven other finalists when presenting their prototype to judges in a final round. Teams will be evaluated based on a number of criteria, including proof that their technology works, the feasibility of bringing their product to market and validation that it provides a solution that customers will use. The winner will take home $100,000 in prize money provided by the Ray C Anderson Foundation. It\u2019s not clear if that will be an adequate sum for the winning team to develop their concept, considering the several years it usually takes to get a product on the market.  Still, Schuknect is optimistic. \u201cLooking to nature for inspiration on how we live on this planet is essential to our future,\u201d she said.  \u201cThe more we can expose both professionals and young people to the power of looking to nature and the power of biomimetic design, the sooner we\u2019re going to get to a place where we are all working towards developing elegant solutions that support the needs of all life on the planet.\u201d ", "publicationDate": "2015-10-30T19:13:32Z", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Innovation", "Food", "Environment", "Science", "Agriculture"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/oct/30/biomimicry-institute-sxsw-eco-agriculture-bioinspired", "title": "Biomimicry: using nature's designs to transform agriculture", "sentences": ["BioX, a finalist team from Bangkok, hopes to increase food security while helping users secure a steady source of income."]}, {"article": "Somewhere out there is a church-burning death-metal act called The Pitchforking Indie Jazzbeards who really need to arrange a name-swap with Vancouver\u2019s Destroyer as soon as possible.

While all the jobs were moving down south, carloads of clubbers would be on the motorway heading north. Their destination: Manchester. A city packed with hedonists determined to have a good time, no matter what damage it might do to their neurology or job prospects. Their playgounds: The Ha\u00e7ienda and The International; later Checkpoint Charlie\u2019s, Sankeys Soap, The Boardwalk and Herbal Tea Party at the New Ardri. But what happened to those revellers once The Ha\u00e7ienda closed, their student grants dried up and they were forced to get jobs and grow up? That was what Beate Peter, an academic from Manchester Metropolitan University, has set out to discover in a new exhibition and research project opening in the city on Saturday.     Lapsed clubber Kate, then and now.    The Lapsed Clubber, showing at Twenty Twenty Two in the Northern Quarter, asks what became of the ravers of 1980s and 1990s Manchester once they\u2019d hung up their glow sticks and swapped their Joe Bloggs for sensible slacks. Peter set up a Facebook group asking for veterans of the scene aged 40-55 to get in touch and tell her what they were doing now.     Richard in the 1990s.       Richard today.    About 50 people submitted photos of themselves, then and now. Some showed that age had not withered their alternative spirit. Richard sent one of himself in a bath in the 1990s, relaxing at an after-party, bare-chested under a sheepskin coat, a bucket hat on his head and a pendant around his neck. He also enclosed a new shot captioned: \u201cIn India, mid-life crisis. And now I\u2019m yoga teacher (what else?).

For a while \u201cgoing out was everything\u201d, Darby told the Guardian. She missed the first rave wave centred around The Ha\u00e7ienda. The mid-90s were her era and she danced to trance and techno at Bugged Out, Megadog and Havok, going out three or four times every week. There is one particularly precious memory she holds from those days. \u201cI know it sounds completely cheesy and ridiculous \u2013 I swear I even had light sticks and UV paint on, though not white gloves, that was earlier \u2013 but I remember looking across the dancefloor and locking eyes with another woman. We were dancing perfectly in time. There was this communion with a complete stranger, with no judgment, no implications for sexuality, just complete joy.\u201d She stopped clubbing not long after a trip to Goa in 1999. \u201cI stopped taking drugs around 2000, then about two years later I was in Sankeys Soap and this young girl in the toilet was holding my hand and telling me she\u2019d taken three pills. She asked me how old I was and literally dropped my hand dead when I said 32. She was appalled and repelled that a 32-year-old would be in the same club as her.

The first book to hit bookshops \u2013 on 18 November \u2013 is written by Sky News commentator Peter van Onselen and academic Wayne Errington. Peter van Onselen\u2019s book focuses on Abbott\u2019s whole prime ministership and is called Battleground: Why the Liberal Party Shirtfronted Tony Abbott.     The cover of Battleground: Why the Liberal Party Shirtfronted Tony Abbott by Peter van Onselen and Wayne Errington.    Niki Savva, political commentator for the Australian, has joined the rush with a book called The Road to Ruin: How Tony Abbott and Peta Credlin Destroyed Their Own Government, which focuses more on the dramatic end of his premiership. Published by Scribe, it is out early next year. With her distinctive take-no-prisoners style, Savva\u2019s book will argue that Abbott listened to Credlin over his own ministers and it was their close relationship that led to his ruin. The third book is written by Aaron Patrick of the Australian Financial Review and is also due out in early 2016. Patrick\u2019s book was to be called The Warriors, but has just been given a new, sexier title by publishers Black Inc: Credlin &amp; Co: How the Abbott Government Destroyed Itself. \u201cIt is the story of a relationship that determined the fate of a government,\u201d the blurb says. \u201cIt shows in stunning detail the disastrous consequences of power abused, and the broken people left in its wake.\u201d Foreign correspondents\u2019 postings under Christmas shadow In a speech at the Lowy Insitute last year Malcolm Turnbull lamented how the number of foreign correspondents had fallen dramatically in recent years. It was mainly due to the cost, he said, which for one post in Indonesia was $300,000 a year. \u201cIn the 1960s the Herald and Weekly Times maintained five journalists in London, three in New York, full-time correspondents in Paris, Rome, Singapore and Rabaul, plus shared correspondents in Johannesburg, Tokyo, Toronto and New Delhi. Fairfax maintained large bureaus in London and New York,\u201d Turnbull said.  But the golden age of the Australian newspaper correspondent is well and truly over after multiple closures of bureaus operated by both Fairfax and News Corp. The Australian alone has closed bureaus in Washington, New York, Los Angeles, Bangkok and New Zealand in recent years.  Fairfax Media is now closing its key foreign bureaus in Washington and Beirut. Sources say editors have told correspondents Nick O\u2019Malley and Ruth Pollard to be home by Christmas. However, Paul McGeough, the chief correspondent for the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age is staying put in Washington \u2013 for the time being, at least. Fairfax\u2019s London bureau was formally closed three years ago and now the post is staffed by a contractor, Nick Miller, who is employed locally. That leaves Fairfax with just two official posts: China (Philip Wen) and Indonesia (Jewel Topsfield), plus Lindsay Murdoch as the south-east Asia correspondent, based in Bangkok. The Delhi bureau was closed in April.  The ABC is now the only media company with an extensive network of foreign bureaus, now totalling 11. Fairfax moves in for another round of redundancies In more bad news for Fairfax readers and staff, management has its sights set on another round of redundancies in the new year. First, editors at the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age in Melbourne are meeting with each journalist to assess how they are coping with the transformation of the company from a newspaper into a digital-first operation.  Staff are also being told at these meetings that if they are thinking about taking a redundancy, now would be a good time to put up their hands. If management doesn\u2019t get the numbers they want \u2013 and we don\u2019t know what they are \u2013 they will move to forced redundancies next year. Fairfax declined to comment. No swish Christmas party for News Corp this year But it\u2019s not just Fairfax that is doing it tough. News Corp Australia has cancelled its all-in company staff Christmas parties this year. The company has always put on a big catered bash at a posh venue in each state for all staff, editorial and non-editorial. But staff at the Herald Sun, Courier-Mail and Daily Telegraph have been told there won\u2019t be a company-funded party in 2015. No word on whether individual mastheads will pay for their own parties for disappointed hacks. A company spokesman declined to comment.  The Australian Financial Review formally moves into the digital age The Australian Financial Review has formally recognised the digital age is here to stay by integrating the website with the daily printed paper and making the content digital-first.  After a visit to the Financial Times in London, editor-in-chief Michael Stutchbury decided the time had come to move away from the focus on the traditional newspaper evening deadline.      A screenshot of a weekly email newsletter to subscribers of the AFR Photograph: AFR    \u201cThe key to making this happen is to publish more of our best content through the day (and then into the paper for the next morning) rather than most of us organising most of our time around a 4pm to 6pm copy print deadline,\u201d Stutch said in a leaked memo.  Under the new structure the role of afr.com editor will be abolished and the \u201cunified news desk itself will run the newsroom, coordinate and plan our major news gathering efforts, run most news conferences, commission stories and then edit and publish them through afr.com and its home page\u201d.  The integrated newsdesk will run by Fiona Buffini and James Thomson and the printed paper will be coordinated by Aaron Patrick, who has the new title of deputy editor (print).    Related: The Weekly Beast: rewrites needed in Walkley nominations for Belle Gibson expos\u00e9    \u201cIn effect, the traditional structure will be inverted,\u201d Stutch said. \u201cUntil now, a newsdesk and newsroom that traditionally focused on producing a newspaper has operated with a digital desk alongside it, albeit one aligned much more closely than only a few years ago.\u201d \u201cUnder the new structure, the integrated newsdesk will run afr.com while our newspaper operation will run alongside this.\u201d Steve Pennells turns down role with Four Corners The ABC\u2019s Four Corners may be the pinnacle of investigative journalism in this country but the pull of working there wasn\u2019t enough for seasoned newspaper journalist, fledgling TV reporter and acclaimed photojournalist Steve Pennells to abandon his roots at the West Australian. The five-time Walkley award-winning journalist, who branched out into television in 2013 on Seven\u2019s Sunday Night, was recently offered a job at Four Corners but turned it down. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he told Weekly Beast. \u201cFour Corners is an iconic program with a long history of outstanding journalism. Any journalist worth his salt would be honoured to be a part of that. But Seven West has been my home for the best part of two decades and has given me some amazing opportunities. I owe my career \u2013 and five Walkleys \u2013 to the West Australian newspaper and, two years ago, Sunday Night led me in my first tentative steps in front of the camera.

On Monday, the supreme court will hear an appeal to decide whether Abdel Hakim Belhaj\u2019s civil claim for damages against the former foreign secretary Jack Straw, Sir Mark Allen, MI6\u2019s counter-terrorism chief at the time, the Home Office and the Foreign Office should be allowed to proceed. The quest for justice conducted by Belhaj and his Moroccan wife, Fatima Bouchar, following their 2004 rendition from the far east to Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s interrogation and torture cells in Tripoli may be moving with frustrating slowness but it threatens to inflict fresh embarrassment on the authorities. Speaking from Tripoli, Bouchar told the Guardian: \u201cI just want an apology from the British government for what I have suffered. I would like the people who were responsible for kidnapping me to be put on trial. I would like to see [them] being charged. I have talked to the British police. I would be very happy to appear in a British court and testify there.\u201d  Bouchar, who was pregnant at the time, and her husband were taken off a flight in Thailand in early 2004. He was a leading member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), an organisation dedicated to Gaddafi\u2019s removal. They were held in what was believed to be a CIA intelligence station near Bangkok airport. \u201cAfter four days, two men and a woman came to the centre and tied me to a stretcher. My hands were tied behind me, my eyes taped shut. When I heard the sounds of an aircraft, I knew I was in an airport. \u201cThey removed my hijab and put on a dark blue dress over me. After that I was injected with something in my left and right arms. I felt really weak and lost all my energy. One of [the abductors] put his hands on my stomach and pushed. I was pregnant.\u201d Bouchar and her husband eventually arrived at Tajoura prison near Tripoli. She was interrogated and her husband tortured. After giving birth to a son, Bouchar was released but forced to stay in Libya. Proof of their ordeal emerged in correspondence with Allen discovered inside the abandoned office of Moussa Koussa, Gaddafi\u2019s foreign minister and former intelligence chief, after the regime fell.  \u201cThere was no reason for us to be kidnapped,\u201d Bouchar said. She and her husband have offered to settle for an apology and a token \u00a31 payment from Straw, Allen and the FCO.  The Metropolitan police confirmed that it first passed evidence from its investigation into British officials\u2019 role in the rendition, codenamed Operation Lydd, to the CPS in June 2014. A second file followed in December last year.  Asked whether a decision had been made, a CPS spokesman said: \u201cThe latest submission by the police was at the end of July this year and we are continuing to advise the police and to look at all the evidence in relation to what is a very large and complex investigation. At this stage, as the matter is under review, we cannot say when we will have sufficient evidence to make a final decision.\u201d The civil case being heard by seven supreme court justices on Monday will assess whether the foreign act of state doctrine should prevent Belhaj\u2019s claim being pursued on the grounds that it would involve other countries. The appeal court dismissed Foreign Office objections that the case should not proceed. Cori Crider, a director of the human rights organisation Reprieve and lawyer for the victims, said: \u201cFor years the British government has sought to shut the door of the British courts to victims of torture and state-sponsored kidnapping. This is not only a shameful attempt to deny our clients\u2019 simple request for an apology, it\u2019s also a shocking waste of public money and official time. The Belhaj family \u2026 deserve justice for their abuse at the hands of our government. The sooner British officials accept that, the better.\u201d Sapna Malik, from the law firm Leigh Day and lawyer for Belhaj, said: \u201cThe court of appeal last year recognised the gravity of the allegations raised by our clients and we are confident that the supreme court will also agree that it is the constitutional duty of the English courts to deal with such important cases despite these attempts to shield the conduct of the security services from judicial scrutiny.\u201d Andrew Cannon, a partner at Herbert Smith Freehills and former Foreign Office legal adviser, said: \u201cThe court of appeal was clear that the case could be heard even where investigation of the conduct of a foreign state is required.  \u201cIt was clearly influenced by the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of international condemnation of torture and rendition, and a concern that unless the English courts took jurisdiction, the very grave allegations would go uninvestigated and the alleged victims would be left without recourse or remedy. The fact that the supreme court agreed to hear the appeal reflects the significance of the issues involved.\u201d The supreme court will also hear the case of Pakistani-born Yunus Rahmatullah, seized by British special forces in Iraq in 2004. He says he was tortured before being handed over to the US and rendered to Bagram prison in Afghanistan. He was released in June last year. Last year, the UK government abandoned its longstanding claim that relations with Washington would suffer if Rahmatullah was allowed to sue for damages in court. It made the concession as a former US ambassador roundly dismissed the government\u2019s case. \u201cIt is highly unlikely the US government would limit intelligence cooperation with the UK if British courts heard Rahmatullah\u2019s or similar claims,\u201d Tom Pickering told the Guardian. The court of appeal ruled last year: \u201cThere is a compelling public interest in the investigation by the English courts of these very grave allegations. The risk of displeasing our allies or offending other states \u2026 cannot justify our declining jurisdiction on grounds of act of state over what is a properly justiciable claim.\u201d Reprieve has asked the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (Ihat), set up in 2010 to conduct criminal investigations into the treatment of detainees, to seek a full copy of last December\u2019s US Senate report on torture for evidence relating to Rahmatullah\u2019s case. Ihat told the Guardian: \u201cIt would be inappropriate to give any details of lines of inquiry in an ongoing investigation. Whether and when to approach the US authorities, and the method of that approach, is an operational matter for the investigators concerned.\u201d Kat Craig, Reprieve\u2019s legal director, said: \u201cIhat\u2019s continued delay in requesting a full, unredacted copy of the torture report is truly inexplicable \u2026 It\u2019s high time Ihat take concrete steps in their investigation.\u201d Reprieve is also concerned about Ihat passing Rahmatullah\u2019s evidence to the Ministry of Defence before it is heard by the supreme court. Ihat said it did not provide any information to the MoD that could prejudice a criminal investigation, \u201cunless there is a legal obligation to do so due to parallel civil proceedings in which the secretary of state for defence is a party.\u201d Craig said: \u201cHow can Ihat do its job effectively if suspects are able to keep tabs on the criminal investigation against them? And how can our clients have any faith that this process might finally bring them justice? This development suggests, yet again, that the government is more concerned about evading accountability than righting the wrongs of the past.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2015-11-08T15:22:09Z", "tags": ["UK supreme court", "Human rights", "Rendition", "Jack Straw", "Law", "UK news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/nov/08/libyan-dissident-rendition-damages-supreme-court-belhaj", "title": "Libyan dissident's fight for rendition damages reaches supreme court", "sentences": ["They were held in what was believed to be a CIA intelligence station near Bangkok airport."]}, {"article": "The government is indulging in an \u201cextravagant extension\u201d of the doctrine of foreign state immunity to avoid responsibility for rendition cases it coordinated, the supreme court has been told.

The allegations were made on the opening day of a test case brought by a Libyan couple and a Pakistani man who claim they were illegally detained in Libya and Afghanistan for many years. One claim has been brought by Abdel Hakim Belhaj, 49, and his wife, Fatima Bouchar, opponents of the former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.  They are suing the former foreign secretary Jack Straw, Sir Mark Allen, a one-time MI6 counter-terrorism officer, and the intelligence services for damages over their rendition. The couple are seeking a nominal sum of \u00a31 each and an apology from each party.

He says he was tortured before being handed over to the US and rendered to Bagram prison in Afghanistan. He was finally released in June last year.  The issue before the supreme court is whether their claims should be allowed to proceed or be struck out on the grounds of the so-called \u201cforeign act of state doctrine\u201d, which the government says grants immunity to foreign states in UK courts.   Several other countries, including the US, were allegedly involved in the abduction of Belhaj and his wife. The court of appeal said last year that any foreign involvement should not prevent the case against UK officials going ahead.  Bouchar, who was pregnant at the time, and her husband were taken off a flight in Thailand in early 2004. He was a leading member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), an organisation dedicated to Gaddafi\u2019s removal.   They were held in what was believed to be a CIA intelligence station near Bangkok airport. They were later flown to Gaddafi\u2019s interrogation and torture cells in Tripoli. At the time the UK government and Gaddafi were in close diplomatic contact.

James Eadie QC, for the government, said it was not alleged that the UK had directly inflicted any mistreatment of the claimants. Rahmatullah, he pointed out, had been held by British forces in Iraq for less than a day before being handed over to the Americans.  \u201cIn both of these cases, the English court is being asked to adjudicate on the lawful actions of a foreign state outside its jurisdiction,\u201d he said.

At the centre of the storm is a mix of acknowledgement and fear around a simple principle, which is that to be effective and meaningful in the 21st century, NGOs have no business continuing to hole up in headquarters in the north.    Related: Bad aid: Should all NGOs close down?    Disintermediation, power-sharing, relocation, centre-shifting: call it what you will, but here\u2019s the reality: the world\u2019s largest NGOs, most of which were established in very different economic and political times in the middle of the last century in the global north, are now heading south. But as big organisations focus on transferring their offices from Europe to Africa, are they missing the bigger picture? Can moving your HQ really change the rampant inequalities in an aid system where just 1% of funding goes to NGOs in developing countries? \u201cIt\u2019s a leap of faith,\u201d says Salil Shetty, who as its chief executive oversaw the trailblazing relocation of ActionAid\u2019s HQ from London to Johannesburg \u2013 the first large-scale NGO to undertake such a shift. \u201cAs with any change there are people who say, \u2018Can you tell me what this is going to look like? What will have happened in a decade\u2019s time?\u2019 And I say, \u2018That will be very hard, because we are trying to empower people and we are letting them shape the future\u2019.\u201dNGOs have been talking about shifting their power bases south for a generation. But it was only a decade ago that ActionAid made the crucial first move, and since then other agencies have seemed surprisingly slow to follow suit. The revolution many see as inevitable now seems to be well and truly underway: Shetty is currently secretary general of Amnesty International where he\u2019s overseeing a reorganisation whose buzz phrase is \u201ccloser to the ground\u201d, with a big reduction of the size of the London office and the development of new hubs around the world.     Moving a big organisation will not be successful if it just concentrates more power on itself  Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah     Key international staff will be scattered around the globe (although the secretary general will continue to be based in London). Oxfam has embarked on a similar journey. What it\u2019s all about, says Winnie Byanyima, Oxfam international executive director, is less about a move south and more about a move global. \u201cIt\u2019s about spreading ourselves around the world and locating ourselves where the struggles are,\u201d she says.  \u201cThe point is to make more impact right across the world. Poverty used to be concentrated in the crisis countries, in the underdeveloped countries. Today the majority of people who live in poverty in the world are in middle-income countries such as Brazil, India and Nigeria.\u201d  The new role of agencies like Oxfam, says Byanyima, isn\u2019t to \u201cdirect\u201d countries in the global south from Europe or North America: it\u2019s about supporting the citizens of these countries to work for their rights and to overcome systemic poverty.  \u201cThis is a quite different sort of work from what we were doing in the early days \u2013 at that stage, it was mostly about service delivery,\u201d she says. The new role is much more about working alongside citizens of the global south and supporting them to work for change \u2013 and for this task, physical positioning is key.  But there are others working in international development who downplay the importance of where offices are located. Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah, secretary general of international NGO Civicus, says that while it\u2019s \u201cnot a bad thing\u201d that big NGOs are moving south, there needs to be a bigger shift in favour of smaller organisations in order to achieve genuine transformation. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad thing that these organisations are moving. There are practical benefits to being located closer to the ground. The realities of development will be much more real if you\u2019re in the south, compared to being in Oxford or London, he says  \u201cAdded to this, the positive spin-offs from these organisations \u2013 the trained activists, lobbyists and professional campaigners \u2013 are going to European cities at the moment. Having that community of professional people working for social change in cities such as Nairobi will benefit that city. If Oxfam ends up employing a few hundred Kenyans in their Nairobi office, that will have a positive impact on Nairobi society. \u201cBut we need to build a more multi-polar civil society landscape. Moving a big organisation will not be that successful if it simply continues to concentrate power and resources\u201d The new-look Oxfam will have its global HQ in Nairobi from 2017/18 \u2013 but it will be a smaller unit than the traditional HQ in Oxford, because parts of the international secretariat which were based in Oxford will move to Washington, Addis Ababa, Geneva and Bangkok.      Salil Shetty says the arguments for moving to the global south are \u2018a no-brainer\u2019. Photograph: Graeme Robertson/Observer    Power will though, be more diffused as well as southern-based: Oxfam has become a confederation of 17 organisations and growing, and each has autonomy within their own country. Oxfam Brazil, Oxfam South Africa and Oxfam Mexico, for example, can each take on goals specific to their own countries, as decided by them.  In a sense, the shift to the south is taking the spirit of the original NGO pioneers and inviting like-minded individuals in other parts of the world to take up the same battles, but this time on their own turf \u2013 and still with the backing of the organisations in the north.  Oxfam, for example, was founded in Oxford in 1942 by a group of social activists who wanted to put pressure on the British government to allow food through the Allied blockade to help the starving in occupied Greece: today\u2019s work is similarly political, but it no longer needs to be directed from a British university town \u2013 although, says Byanyima, the organisation is forever imbued with elements of its founding country. \u201cIt\u2019s got the very British values of justice, of giving back, of fairness, of equality: these are the values that are at the heart of Oxfam.\u201d Now though what is needed says Byanyima is a focus on and commitment towards movement building in the countries of the south. \u201cStrategy has shifted: we continue to deliver services where they\u2019re lacking \u2013 in crisis-hit or wartorn countries, for example \u2013 but otherwise, what we\u2019re encouraging is people power.\u201d This legitimacy, and an authority, that comes from voices within the countries concerned packs an equally powerful punch for Amnesty, explains Shetty. \u201cIt\u2019s easy for governments to dismiss human rights and say this is a western concept: but everything is totally different when you are there with people from the region \u2013 it really weakens the counter-argument,\u201d he says.  This was especially pronounced in Nigeria. \u201cWe\u2019ve been exposing the crimes of Boko Haram, and I get letters saying, \u2018You don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening here\u2019. And that\u2019s why we need an office in Nigeria, to give us credibility.\u201d  Sometimes having the power hub in the south can make a big difference time-wise. \u201cWhen we heard the Japanese government was going to execute someone the following morning, if we\u2019d had to wait until the London office opened we\u2019d have had no chance. But now we have Hong Kong, so we can act straight away.\u201d A major ambition of Amnesty, a member organisation, is to build up its numbers in the south \u2013 so being a stronger physical presence there is vital. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 7 million members and historically most of them came from the global north. But in the last three or four years things have changed: we now have more than 2 million members in India, for example,\u201d says Shetty. The traditional model of Amnesty was to influence the behaviour of governments in Europe, so that they would put pressure on other governments: today, the model is to encourage governments across the world to be answerable to their own people.  For Sriskandarajah, while the efforts of Amnesty and Oxfam to shift their operations to the global south are welcome, these big organisations should also do their bit on trying to develop grassroots organisations so they can have a greater impact in their own countries.   Related: Justin Forsyth: 'If NGOs stay politically correct, we won't have an impact'    \u201cWe don\u2019t yet have a diverse enough civil society eco-system of NGOs in the global south. At the moment we\u2019ve got Swedish NGOs campaigning on human rights in Swaziland, but few Swazi organisations have the resources to run their own campaigns.  \u201cWe should look at how we strengthen the capacity of local actors, so they can run their own campaigns and access the resources they need. There needs to be a change in how the system operates, and the bigger organisations need to be part of that.\u201d As with any power shift, the path to change has not been smooth. \u201cWe had a pretty rough time both in ActionAid and in Amnesty,\u201d says Shetty. \u201cAny change brings uncertainty \u2013 there\u2019s a resistance to change. People say if you move Amnesty\u2019s decision-making to Africa and Asia you\u2019ll lose your impartiality, and our gold dust is our independence and impartiality. But that argument is naive: the idea that if you\u2019re in the north you\u2019re impartial, and if you\u2019re from Africa you\u2019re not independent \u2013 that argument is itself loaded.\u201d  As far as Byanyima is concerned, the strategy \u2013 while it seems revolutionary \u2013 is actually the way to make sure that the original ambitions of NGOs like Oxfam continue. \u201cOur approach is changing,\u201d she says. \u201cBut our mission endures.\u201d In essence, says Shetty, the arguments for moving to the global south are \u201ca no-brainer\u201d: it makes NGOs more authentic, more efficient, faster, better informed and more accountable. It is also fairer, and more sustainable in the long term. So why are so many still waiting to implement the change? \u201cThey\u2019re watching Amnesty now, just as they\u2019ve watched ActionAid,\u201d says Shetty. But it\u2019s clear that from where he\u2019s sitting, they can\u2019t just go on watching. \u201cThey have to bite the bullet, act and follow suit.\u201d The world of international aid and development is certainly changing, but it remains to be seen whether its recipients will really notice the difference.

Jacobson, then 40, was president of production at Disney (among other things, she had overseen the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie). She was one of the most powerful women in Hollywood. Yet in the wake of a corporate reshuffle, rumours had reached her that her job was in danger. Panicked, she stepped from the delivery room and phoned Disney CEO Richard Cook. She was fired. Jacobson now runs her own production company, Color Force. It is a small operation, but one with a mighty trick up its sleeve: she is the producer of The Hunger Games, the dystopian action movie series. The fourth and last, Mockingjay Part 2, is about to be released. Made with brisk efficiency \u2013 the first came out in 2012 \u2013 the films have been outlandishly successful. The total gross of the three to date is $2.3bn (\u00a31.5bn). In Britain (the films are globally popular), the most recent, Mockingjay Part 1, accounted for two in every three cinema tickets sold on its opening weekend. But money is not the whole story. With vast audiences has come huge cultural impact. Mockingjay Part 2 was recently found to have higher levels of anticipation among cinema-goers than the new Star Wars films. But Star Wars has never been seen as being about class and capitalism. When The Hunger Games end, we will lose the most subversive blockbusters in history.   Related: The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 review: Jennifer Lawrence drags franchise through final round    When the first of the novels on which the films are based was published in 2008, Jacobson was finding the move from studio executive to producer tough. Life at Disney had been lived at the head of the industry food chain. Now, there were the long waits to see if her calls got returned. \u201cThere\u2019s a particular quiet that can settle over a producer\u2019s office that took a long time to get used to,\u201d she says from her LA office. \u201cI found it lonely and scary.\u201d     \u2018There are always books about boys on adventures. But a girl, that was new\u2019 \u2026 Lawrence as Katniss. Photograph: Allstar/Lionsgate    Jacobson wasn\u2019t naive: she always saw the commercial possibilities in Suzanne Collins\u2019 book. But it was the idea of a credible heroine and a generation regarded as disposable that \u201cobsessed\u201d her, the scale of her zeal enough to persuade Collins to sell her the rights. The whole thing was a risk, even once the followup novels became bestsellers. \u201cI\u2019m never confident. I\u2019m always the one saying: \u2018You know, there could be a giant storm on the opening weekend.\u2019\u201d There was no storm. Some of the films\u2019 success can be easily explained: these are thrilling accounts of a vividly realised world, Panem, a post-apocalyptic North America where the Capitol exists in pampered splendour while the surrounding Districts toil and starve. There was high-end acting talent (eventually including Julianne Moore and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman); there was Jennifer Lawrence, smartly cast as the fearless Katniss Everdeen. (Like the baroque fashions of the Capitol, Collins\u2019 characters\u2019 names were a happy dollop of absurdity amid the horror: using an online generator, I come out as Yullpetra M Walkfern).           The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 - video review    And yes, there was a major marketing campaign. But plenty of failed films have been expensively marketed, many like The Hunger Games based on novels from the young adult genre that delighted bookshops. For much of the past decade, Hollywood has been busy turning hugely successful YA books into limp franchises (Divergent, The Maze Runner, Percy Jackson) and failed would-be first instalments (Ender\u2019s Game, Inkheart, The Mortal Instruments). The Hunger Games was, as usual, different.     A satire on of the cut-throat format of reality TV \u2013 prseenter \u2026 Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman. Photograph: Everett/Rex Shutterstock    Lama Elwardany is 17. Like Nina Jacobson, she became obsessed with The Hunger Games as soon as she read the first novel, given to her as a 13th birthday present. Her first response was shock: older readers may have caught an echo of the Japanese movie Battle Royale, but Elwardany reeled at the idea of children from the Districts being sent to compete in lavish, murderous spectacles for the Capitol\u2019s entertainment. Katniss, the girl who would become the face of the resistance, was another surprise. \u201cThere are always books about boys on adventures, that\u2019s what all the YA fiction was about. But a girl, that was new.\u201d   Related: In debt, out of luck: why Generation K fell in love with The Hunger Games    We\u2019re in a classroom at Maria Fidelis, a Catholic secondary school in Somers Town, the scuffed patch of London behind King\u2019s Cross and Euston stations. Elwardany is one of a group of girls here to talk about what the films mean to them. All are fans; most graduated from the books. For all the earnest commentary the movies have inspired, it\u2019s teenagers like these who queued up for them. \u201cWhat really interested me,\u201d Elwardany goes on, \u201cwere the scenes in District 12 [the Appalachian coalbelt Katniss called home]. And she never focused on little things, everything was about how important her family was to her. I\u2019ve got a lot of cousins and that means a lot to me.\u201d Half-Egyptian, half-Lebanese, Elwardany is still close to her family in the Middle East. Here, most of the girls talking to me are either first generation immigrants or the daughters of refugees. Aida Tekle, 16, says that when she first saw the films, she took them for pure entertainment. It was later that she began to connect what she saw on screen with the stories her mother told her about Eritrea, and why they left: the state of near slavery people lived in, the submission of the media to government. \u201cThe films relate to things that matter to me. The things that happen in my country, I see them in Panem. It\u2019s almost funny how similar it is.\u201d As YA fiction has swept all before it commercially, the most frequent explanation is that it acts as a mirror to adolescent life: the toxic cocktail of peer and academic pressures analogised into puppet-masters and epic battles. At one level, this is what The Hunger Games does too. But it also combines the fear of the now with the fear of what\u2019s next. Like teenagers across the west, the girls here have been hit hard by austerity; many of Maria Fidelis\u2019 pupils are bright kids who now see university as priced beyond them.     \u2018Adults think we\u2019re too young to understand inequality\u2019 \u2026 Donald Sutherland as President Snow. Photograph: Allstar/Lionsgate    \u201cOne perspective about The Hunger Games is the feeling among the young that what awaits them in adulthood is very unforgiving,\u201d Jacobson says. \u201cI get that. The world we\u2019ve made for them is a harsh arena.\u201d But there\u2019s more. If YA deals with the churning drama of teenage life, The Hunger Games goes further, and deeper. \u201cI never thought it was YA,\u201d Jacobson says. \u201cTo me, it was disguised as YA.\u201d To different people, the films will be about different things \u2013 or maybe the same things in a different order. Katniss\u2019 importance as a female presence onscreen has been universally praised; at Maria Fidelis, the girls also talk of overlaps with their experience of being caught between the west and the countries of their parents. Jacobson says that for Collins, the novels had a meaning specific to her own childhood, the daughter of a US Air Force pilot who served in Vietnam. As well as portraying youth as war, they were also about war full stop, reflecting back the long American travails in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cOur country has been at war for over a decade. That always echoed through the material.\u201d If the cartoon Hollywood executive is a slick philistine, Jacobson\u2019s background is different. Having studied semiotics at Brown University, she saw ripples under the story\u2019s surface. \u201cI loved the way Suzanne shows how we construct violence and tragedy as entertainment. That felt topical and also very relevant to my education.\u201d The most obvious target was reality TV, the Games themselves a satire of the cut-throat format that has became television\u2019s default setting.     A woman protests against the Thai military coup with the three-fingered salute of defiance from the film, which was banned. Bangkok 2014 Photograph: ZUMA/REX    But the films also exposed the very function of the media. The Capitol doesn\u2019t just televise kids killing each other; the bloodshed is served in a sparkly gloop of contrived backstories. In The Hunger Games, everything ends up on TV, both inner lives and nightmarish violence. Rebellion is simply recycled back into the script. Eventually it all gets meta. We could certainly note that the movies turn huge profits for Lionsgate, the Canadian-American conglomerate that distributes the films. We can also marvel at how a teenage action franchise has shot into the heart of the mainstream a message so starkly radical you end up feeling, as the cultural theorist Mark Fisher put it: \u201cHow can I be watching this? How can this be allowed?\u201d It\u2019s a message the audience hears. \u201cAll the films highlights issues with class,\u201d Tekle says. \u201cThe conditions Katniss lives in, you see how unfair it is. You have people born into the Capitol who don\u2019t have to work for anything, and in the Districts people work to keep them in luxury.\u201d I ask if any of that reminds the room of modern Britain and everyone cracks up laughing: \u201cOf course it does!\u201d The girls animatedly discuss the things Elwardany says \u201cadults think we\u2019re too young to understand\u201d \u2013 inequality, a self-interested elite, a docile public. \u201cYou see how entertainment is used to distract us,\u201d says Megan Animashaun, 16. \u201cHere, it\u2019s not even that they censor the news, we choose not to pay attention to it.\u201d Then Elwardany mentions Thailand, where last year, the military junta of Prayut Chan-ocha detained protesters who had been using the film\u2019s anti-government three-fingered salute. Mockingjay Part 1 was pulled from Thai cinemas. The Hunger Games isn\u2019t the only bubble of rage in blockbuster film \u2013 remember the cry of \u201cApes will rise\u201d in the rebooted Planet of the Apes, or the patriarchal scumbaggery of Mad Max: Fury Road. But it is the most coherent, and the one with the most influence. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly about revolution,\u201d Jacobson says. \u201cThere is a journey from one person\u2019s defiance of the system, to rebellion, to revolution.\u201d Of course, there\u2019s a particular power to the idea of a girl as revolutionary. It\u2019s hard to discuss why The Hunger Games is so good without remembering how bad its predecessors were. Mentioning Twilight, a groan fills the room. When they were younger, most of the girls here read Stephanie Meyer\u2019s vampire romances. Now, Animashaun says: \u201cI look at them and think: \u2018Ugh.\u2019 It\u2019s just weird, this helpless girl who can\u2019t even live without a man to live for.\u201d \u201cI actually think it\u2019s pretty degrading,\u201d Elwardany says. \u201cNext to The Hunger Games, it looks silly.\u201d To Jacobson, the films are \u201cfeminist in that Katniss\u2019 decisions aren\u2019t based on what a boy will think of her. Female characters are forced to fit around someone else\u2019s narrative. Katniss takes control of hers.\u201d Over the course of the series, Lawrence has become a particular kind of role model: the girl who tripped up on the way to collecting her Oscar. \u201cShe\u2019s honest and she\u2019s funny,\u201d Elwardany says. \u201cWe like that.\u201d At Maria Fidelis, they tell me that some fans complained that Katniss should be thinner for the sake of authenticity; here, they praise an actor with what seems a healthy body image. (As Elwardany puts it: \u201cIt\u2019s not about sticking to the book, it\u2019s about sticking to the message of the book.\u201d)Morsale Gharfooyar is 17. Her family came to London from Afghanistan; now she\u2019s studying for her A-levels. \u201cKatniss wasn\u2019t glamourised,\u201d she says. \u201cMost of these dystopian movies, somehow the actresses still always have perfect hair and make-up, but she looked real. If she was in a fight, her costume would still be torn in the next scene.\u201d     \u2018Suzanne shows how we construct violence and tragedy as entertainment\u2019\u2026 Katniss is forced to play The Hunger Games. Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar/Lionsgate    She also came to the books after reading Twilight. \u201cThe Hunger Games was a starting point for me growing up. It broke me out of my bubble.\u201d The movies too were revelatory. \u201cIn other films, the heroine kills the bad guys and everyone cheers. With Katniss, every time she kills anyone, even a villain, she feels bad and so do you. The films bring home the reality of death. It\u2019s not just someone being removed from the film.\u201d In December 2012, between the first two films in the series, 20 children and six adults were killed by a gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Newtown, Connecticut. The tragedy would have floored Jacobson under any circumstances; Sandy Hook was also where Collins lived. Attention glared at the films, but the violence in The Hunger Games has always been profoundly considered. Wincingly, some middle-aged critics sniffed at the films for \u201csoftening\u201d their violence to secure certificates that accommodated young teenagers \u2013 as if it mattered more that grown men see blood when kids killed each other than for real kids to see the films. \u201cThe point was always how deeply felt the violence was,\u201d Jacobson says \u201cNot how vividly it was seen. We didn\u2019t shy away from it, but the risk was being guilty of the sins of the Capitol, exploiting it for entertainment.\u201d For Lawrence, the films have been generally transformative. This year she published a frank essay for Lena Dunham\u2019s newsletter Lenny about discovering she was routinely paid less than her male co-stars. Now conversations about unequal pay for actresses have broken out through the entertainment industry. Jacobson says her star shared Katniss\u2019 aversion to the spotlight before reaching the same conclusion: if she had the world\u2019s attention, she should say something excellent. \u201cI\u2019ve watched with pride as Jen has stepped up.\u201d When Jacobson was developing The Hunger Games, she read the original novel with her daughter. But the legacy of the films, she says, will be that her 16-year-old son loved them too. \u201cWhen I was starting in the business, I was explicitly told: \u2018Girls will identify with a male protagonist but boys won\u2019t identify with a female protagonist, and for that one reason, we need male movie stars more than female movie stars.\u2019 And The Hunger Games has proved that is completely false. It was wrong, and it was sexist bullshit. And I feel lucky to have helped give that ideology a long overdue kick.\u201d The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 goes on general release in the UK Thursday 19 November", "publicationDate": "2015-11-18T19:19:42Z", "tags": ["The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 2", "The Hunger Games", "Young Adult", "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire", "Jennifer Lawrence", "Hunger Games", "Suzanne Collins", "Twilight", "Culture", "Books", "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1", "Film"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/18/how-the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-2-staged-a-revolution", "title": "How The Hunger Games staged a revolution", "sentences": ["Bangkok 2014 Photograph: ZUMA/REX    But the films also exposed the very function of the media."]}, {"article": "Does the massive foreign and national corporate buying of urban buildings and land that took off after the 2008 crisis signal an emergent new phase in major cities? From mid-2013 to mid-2014, corporate buying of existing properties exceeded $600bn (\u00a3395bn) in the top 100 recipient cities, and $1trillion a year later \u2013 and this figure includes only major acquisitions (eg. a minimum of $5m in the case of New York City). I want to examine the details of this large corporate investment surge, and why it matters. Cities are the spaces where those without power get to make a history and a culture, thereby making their powerlessness complex. If the current large-scale buying continues, we will lose this type of making that has given our cities their cosmopolitanism. Indeed, at the current scale of acquisitions, we are seeing a systemic transformation in the pattern of land ownership in cities: one that alters the historic meaning of the city. Such a transformation has deep and significant implications for equity, democracy and rights. A city is a complex but incomplete system: in this mix lies the capacity of cities across histories and geographies to outlive far more powerful, but fully formalised, systems \u2013 from large corporations to national governments. London, Beijing, Cairo, New York, Johannesburg and Bangkok \u2013 to name but a few \u2013 have all outlived multiple types of rulers and of businesses.     Independent shops in Peckham, south London. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    In this mix of complexity and incompleteness lies the possibility for those without power to assert \u201cwe are here\u201d and \u201cthis is also our city\u201d. Or, as the legendary statement by the fighting poor in Latin American cities puts it, \u201cEstamos presentes\u201d: we are present, we are not asking for money, we are just letting you know that this is also our city. It is in cities to a large extent where the powerless have left their imprint \u2013 cultural, economic, social: mostly in their own neighbourhoods, but eventually these can spread to a vaster urban zone as \u201cethnic\u201d food, music, therapies and more.    If the current buying continues, we will lose the type of making that has given our cities their cosmopolitanism    All of this cannot happen in a business park, regardless of its density \u2013 they are privately controlled spaces where low-wage workers can work, but not \u201cmake\u201d. Nor can this happen in the world\u2019s increasingly militarised plantations and mines. It is only in cities where that possibility of gaining complexity in one\u2019s powerlessness can happen \u2013 because nothing can fully control such a diversity of people and engagements. Those with power to some extent do not want to be bothered by the poor, so the model is often to abandon them to their own devices. In some cities (for example, in the US and Brazil) there is extreme violence by police. Yet this can often become a public issue, which is perhaps a first step in the longer trajectories of gaining at least some rights. It is in cities where so many of the struggles for vindications have taken place, and have, in the long run, partly succeeded. But it is this possibility \u2013 the capacity to make a history, a culture and so much more \u2013 that is today threatened by the surge in large-scale corporate re-development of cities.      Chinese property investments in London. Illustration: Knight Frank    A new phase It is easy to explain the post-2008 urban investment surge as \u201cmore of the same\u201d. After all, the late 1980s also saw rapid growth of national and foreign buying of office buildings and hotels, especially in New York and London. In The Global City, I wrote about the large share of buildings in the City of London that were foreign-owned at the height of that phase.Financial firms from countries as diverse as Japan and the Netherlands found they needed a strong foothold in London\u2019s City to access continental European capital and markets.  But an examination of the current trends shows some significant differences and points to a whole new phase in the character and logics of foreign and national corporate acquisitions. (I do not see much of a difference in terms of the urban impact between national and foreign investment. The key fact here is that both are corporate and large scale.) Four features stand out: \u2022 The sharp scale-up in the buying of buildings, even in cities that have long been the object of such investments, notably NY and London. For instance, the Chinese have most recently emerged as major buyers in cities such as London and New York. Today there are about 100 cities worldwide that have become significant destinations for such acquisitions \u2013 foreign corporate buying of properties from 2013 to 2014 grew by 248% in Amsterdam/Randstadt, 180% in Madrid and 475% in Nanjing. In contrast, the growth rate was relatively lower for the major cities in each region: 68.5% for New York, 37.6% for London, and 160.8% for Beijing. \u2022 The extent of new construction. The rapid-growth period of the 1980s and 90s was often about acquiring buildings \u2013 notably high-end Harrods in London, and Sachs Fifth Avenue and the Rockefeller Center in New York. In the post-2008 period, much buying of buildings is to destroy them and replace them with far taller, far more corporate and luxurious types of buildings \u2013 basically, luxury offices and luxury apartments. \u2022 The spread of mega-projects with vast footprints that inevitably kill much urban tissue: little streets and squares, density of street-level shops and modest offices, and so on. These megaprojects raise the density of the city, but they actually de-urbanise it \u2013 and thereby bring to the fore the fact, easily overlooked in much commentary about cities, that density is not enough to have a city. \u2022 The foreclosing on modest properties owned by modest-income households. This has reached catastrophic levels in the US, with Federal Reserve data showing that more than 14 million households have lost their homes from 2006 to 2014. One outcome is a significant amount of empty or under-occupied urban land, at least some of which is likely to be \u201cre-developed\u201d.     The proposed Atlantic Yards luxury residential towers in Brooklyn. Photograph: AP    A further striking feature of this period is the acquisition of whole blocks of underutilised or dead industrial land for site development. Here, the prices paid by buyers can get very high. One example is the acquisition of Atlantic Yards, a vast stretch of land in New York City by one of the largest Chinese building companies for $5bn. Currently, this land is occupied by a mixture of modest factories and industrial services, modest neighbourhoods, and artists\u2019 studios and venues that have been pushed out of lower Manhattan by large-scale developments of high-rise apartment buildings.    Privatisation in the 90s has resulted in a reduction of public buildings and an escalation in large, corporate ownership    This very urban mix of occupants will be thrown out and replaced by 14 formidable luxury residential towers \u2013 a sharp growth of density that actually has the effect of de-urbanising that space. It will be a sort of de facto \u201cgated\u201d space with lots of people; not the dense mix of uses and types of people we think of as \u201curban\u201d. This type of development is taking off in many cities \u2013 mostly with virtual walls, but sometimes also with real ones. I would argue that with this type of development, the virtual and the actual walls have similar impacts on de-urbanising pieces of a city. The scale and the character of these investments are captured in the vast amounts spent on buying urban properties and land. Those global, corporate investments of $600bn from mid-2013 to mid-2014, and over 1tn from mid-2014 to mid 2015, were just to acquire existing buildings. The figure excludes site development, another major trend.  This proliferating urban gigantism has been strengthened and enabled by the privatisations and deregulations that took off in the 1990s across much of the world, and have continued since then with only a few interruptions. The overall effect has been a reduction in public buildings, and an escalation in large, corporate private ownership. The result is a thinning in the texture and scale of spaces previously accessible to the public. Where before there was a government office building handling the regulations and oversight of this or that public economic sector, or addressing the complaints from the local neighbourhood, now there might be a corporate headquarters, a luxury apartment building or a guarded mall.

Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images    De-urbanisation Global geographies of extraction have long been key to the western world\u2019s economic development. And now these have moved on to urban land, going well beyond the traditional association with plantations and mines, even as these have been extended and made more brutally efficient.    A large city is a frontier zone where actors from different worlds can have an encounter with no rules of engagement    The corporatising of access and control over urban land has extended not only to high-end urban sites, but also to the land beneath the homes of modest households and government offices. We are witnessing an unusually large scale of corporate buying of whole pieces of cities in the last few years. The mechanisms for these extractions are often far more complex than the outcomes, which can be quite elementary in their brutality.  One key transformation is a shift from mostly small private to large corporate modes of ownership, and from public to private. This is a process that takes place in bits and pieces, some big and some small, and to some extent these practices have long been part of the urban land market and urban development. But today\u2019s scale-up takes it all to a whole new dimension, one that alters the historic meaning of the city. This is particularly so because what was small and/or public is becoming large and private. The trend is to move from small properties embedded in city areas that are crisscrossed by streets and small public squares, to projects that erase much of this public tissue of streets and squares via mega-projects with large, sometimes huge, footprints. This privatises and de-urbanises city space no matter the added density.     There are moments in the routines of a city when we all become urban subjects ... Rush hour at King\u2019s Cross station. Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images    Large cities have long been complex and incomplete. This has enabled the incorporation of diverse people, logics, politics. A large, mixed city is a frontier zone where actors from different worlds can have an encounter for which there are no established rules of engagement, and where the powerless and the powerful can actually meet. This also makes cities spaces of innovations, small and large. And this includes innovations by those without power: even if they do not necessarily become powerful in the process, they produce components of a city, thus leaving a legacy that adds to its cosmopolitanism \u2013 something that few other places enable.  Such a mix of complexity and incompleteness ensures a capacity to shape an urban subject and an urban subjectivity. It can partly override the religious subject, the ethnic subject, the racialised subject and, in certain settings, also the differences of class. There are moments in the routines of a city when we all become urban subjects \u2013 rush hour is one such mix of time and space. But today, rather than a space for including people from many diverse backgrounds and cultures, our global cities are expelling people and diversity. Their new owners, often part-time inhabitants, are very international \u2013 but that does not mean they represent many diverse cultures and traditions. Instead, they represent the new global culture of the successful \u2013 and they are astoundingly homogeneous, no matter how diverse their countries of birth and languages. This is not the urban subject that our large, mixed cities have historically produced. This is, above all, a global \u201ccorporate\u201d subject.   Related: The privatisation of cities' public spaces is escalating. It is time to take a stand    Much of urban change is inevitably predicated on expelling what used to be. Since their beginnings, whether 3,000 years old or 100, cities have kept reinventing themselves, which means there are always winners and losers. Urban histories are replete with accounts of those who were once poor and quasi-outsiders, or modest middle classes, that gained ground \u2013 because cities have long accommodated extraordinary variety.  But today\u2019s large-scale corporate buying of urban space in its diverse instantiations introduces a de-urbanising dynamic. It is not adding to mixity and diversity. Instead it implants a whole new formation in our cities \u2013 in the shape of a tedious multiplication of high-rise luxury buildings.  One way of putting it is that this new set of implants contains within it a logic all of its own \u2013 one which cannot be tamed into becoming part of the logics of the traditional city. It keeps its full autonomy and, one might say, gives us all its back. And that does not look pretty.

I lost all idea of where I was and I could only think, where was Johanna? \u201cI fought in the dirty water trying to escape. I was being trapped by the current, screaming.

The inquest was told that the friends met in Bangkok in April and had travelled up to Chiang Mai, in northern Thailand, to visit sanctuaries and ride elephants. The quartet then crossed the border into Laos where they embarked on a two-day slow-boat cruise. Evans said: \u201cOn the first day we stopped in this lovely little village to have lunch.

His fiction works are few and far between, although Perry has established a name for himself as a dab hand at espionage thrillers. His first novel, Program for a Puppet, was an international bestseller. This was followed by Blood is a Stranger, exploring the inherent perils of uranium mining and nuclear weapons. Perry returns with a third topical thriller, The Honourable Assassin, set against a backdrop of drug trafficking and corruption in the midst of Thailand\u2019s 2014 military coup.   Related: Good Money by JM Green review \u2013 crime, grime and dark humour in Melbourne's west    Vic Cavalier is a middle-aged journalist who, though he failed to enter the SAS as a young man, was recruited as a spy by the Australian government. Journalism is his livelihood but also Cavalier\u2019s cover for any dirty work his spymasters ask of him.  When the deputy of a Mexican drug cartel is found executed on a Melbourne street, with all signs pointing at it being a hit job, Cavalier is sent to cover the story. Here he meets Thai special investigator Jacinta Cin Lai, a woman whose beauty is surpassed only by her incredible martial arts skills and expert marksmanship. His search for the murderer takes Cavalier to Thailand. From here, the Mexicans supply lucrative new markets under the cover of legitimate businesses, supported by a Thai government about to be ousted in a military coup. It\u2019s the perfect set-up for an action-packed thriller. Drug trafficking, murdered drug lords, Cavalier\u2019s mysterious past and uncertain future and the hovering potential of intimacy with Cin Lai.  Perry was on a research trip to Thailand in May 2014 when the Royal Thai armed forces launched the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. It fuels the story\u2019s authenticity as Cavalier walks the streets of Bangkok with ongoing rioting and strictly enforced curfews. Motivation is high for both Cavalier and Cin Lai to remove Mendez, the head of the Mexican cartel. Mendez has a nasty habit of holding one-way orgies with prostitutes he drugs to the eyeballs and later decapitates. Cavalier\u2019s half-Thai daughter Pon and two friends of Cin Lai were executed by Mendez in the same manner. There is no doubt that The Honourable Assassin is thoroughly researched. Perry interviewed a former SAS officer to get Cavalier\u2019s character right. Like Perry, Cavalier is a journalist and a cricketer, and the author says he has also been approached by spy agencies to work for them. And yet he never feels authentic, rather underdeveloped and cliched.  As the novel begins, he is drinking heavily as a way of dealing with his grief for the loss of his daughter and the resulting failure of his marriage. This is a far cry from his heroics at the SAS training camp 35 years prior. On top of this, Cavalier has just been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Accepting that in his current condition he has also remained a top-class spy for the Australian government is a stretch. Cin Lai, the country\u2019s Muay Thai kickboxing champion, is far more believable as a lethal weapon. On the issue of drug trafficking, Perry adds little more in the way of in-depth detail than what could be gleaned from a cursory glance at news media. He includes no drug addicts exemplifying the terrible damage addiction causes. Money laundering is touched on but not explored. Why the number two man in the Mexican drug cartel, Labasta, is in Australia remains unexplained. The Honourable Assassin is a novel that has a great premise but is underdeveloped. Thrillers are supposed to be high-stakes stories, an emotional rollercoaster where the protagonist is pitted against the wily forces of evil, losing everything that matters before ultimate triumph. Great writers of this genre, such as John le Carr\u00e9 or Frederick Forsyth, pen page-turners that suck you into the action. Perry never achieves the level of anxiety required to make The Honourable Assassin a terrific read. As an espionage thriller, it fails to engage on anything more than a superficial level.

Chinatown No exploration of Bangkok\u2019s street food is complete without a trip to Chinatown (referred to among locals as Yaowarat), which is considered the birthplace of street food in Thailand and remains a prime foodie destination. And any discussion of Thai street food must also include a mention of satay \u2013 meat that is threaded on a bamboo stick, grilled over an open flame and served with peanut sauce and an ajad of cucumber, shallots and chillies in sugar syrup. Although it sounds simple enough, satay is hard to make memorable.

Others say the treats, which come floating in a glass of sweet, iced coconut milk with a scattering of cubed jackfruit, was first sold in front of a shopfront bearing the word \u201cSingapore\u201d.

Photograph: Chawadee Nualkhair    Handmade ice-cream is not a typical street food dish in Bangkok, but Nuttaporn Ice Cream (94 Phraeng Phuton Square, off of Tanao Road) has had plenty of practice making it from scratch \u2013 60 years to be exact. Although the coconut milk flavour (kati) is its most famous, Nuttaporn also offers mango (mamuang), chocolate, coffee, and Thai iced tea (cha yen), alongside toppings such as roasted peanut, corn kernels, lotus seeds, red beans, shredded coconut, sweetened plum seeds, and coconut sticky rice. Sukhumvit Although this area (named after the traffic-packed road that runs through it) is now an upscale neighbourhood full of expats, Starbucks and sushi bars, Sukhumvit still bears testament to the fact that, wherever money is, good food of all types will follow. Of all the chicken noodle vendors in Bangkok, Guaythiew Pik Gai Sainampung (392/20 Sukhumvit Road between Sois 18 and 20) stands out for its cleanliness, charmingly cluttered decor, and delicious soup noodle menu. The speciality of the house, after which this old-fashioned shophouse is named, is guaythiew pik gai, a soup noodle dish in which your choice of sen mee (rice vermicelli), sen yai (thick rice noodles), or giem ee (Chinese-style handrolled noodles) is doused in a long-simmering chicken broth and topped with chopped peanuts, julienned green beans and chicken wings that have braised overnight.

Locals get their fix with a morning stop at Tang Meng Noodle (corner of Sukhumvit Soi 49) which, despite its name, is actually prized for its succulent chicken and tangy, garlicky dipping sauce. Other standouts on the extensive menu are the guaythiew yen ta fo (soup noodles in fermented tofu broth) and pad krapao moo (rice topped with minced pork stir-fried with chillies and holy basil). Food from Isaan (in Thailand\u2019s north-east) is the most popularamong Thais, thanks to its simplicity and searing spiciness. Get a fix of the \u201choly trinity\u201d of grilled chicken (gai yang), sticky rice (khao niew) and grated vegetable salad (som tum) at Nomjit Gai Yang (corner of Ekamai Soi 18), one of the neighbourhood\u2019s most longstanding and well-regarded vendors of Isaan cuisine. Silom and Sathorn Silom and Sathorn roads, considered Bangkok\u2019s central business district, are chockablock with spots for a quick bite, few of them gourmet destinations. But a handful of stalls offer tasty traditional favourites that will demand little of your time and even less of your pocket.     Khao soy at Khao Soy Silom 3. Photograph: Chawadee Nualkhair    Khao soy (curried egg noodles) is probably northern Thailand\u2019s most famous dish: it\u2019s a mix of Chinese-style noodles, central Thailand-inflected coconut milk curry, and braised beef or chicken. One of the few vendors to offer it in the capital, Khao Soy Silom Soi 3 (Silom Soi 3, Soi Pipat) presents diners with a nice bowl of flat egg noodles swimming in a gently flavoured coconut broth liberally garnished with deep-fried noodles, green onions, raw shallots and a wedge of fresh lime.   Related: Bangkok in three days: holiday itinerary    The roadside favourite of ped thun (braised duck) betrays Thai street food\u2019s Chinese origins. A slab of juicy duck meat is cut and served with plain white rice, a piquant chilli sauce meant to cut through the fattiness of the meat, and a clear broth of either duck bones or pork, flavoured with a slice of bitter melon. The shophouse vendor Hong Aharn Boon Ek (33/16 St Louis Soi 3) serves an exemplary version of this dish, unadorned by distractions such as noodles or curry. Although not officially in the Silom/Sathorn area, longtime favourite Bamee Gua (82 Lang Suan Road, +662 251 6020) sits on a popular street at the edge of Lumpini Park, a stone\u2019s throw away from the central business district. Its speciality is betrayed by this shophouse\u2019s name: bamee, or Chinese-style egg noodles, either served with a mix of pork, chicken, squid, fish meatballs and dumplings (bamee asawin), or pan-fried and topped with shredded ham and chicken (ee-mee, available on Tuesdays, Thursdays and weekends). Saphan Lueng The Yellow Bridge neighbourhood has long been known among Bangkokians as a street food highlight. Packed with aharn tham sung (made-to-order) stalls manned by skilful wok cooks, noodle vendors, dessert carts and the occasional porridge shop, Saphan Lueng rivals Chinatown, but without all the tourists.     Boiled blood cockles from Jay Sri. Photograph: Chawadee Nualkhair    Rice porridge gets little love from many tourists, but it remains a major \u201cfood group\u201d among Thai street food aficionados. Thai-style porridge \u2013 which leaves the rice grains intact \u2013 is the main draw at the confusingly marked Khao Thom Pla Saphan Lueng (506/2-3, Soi Pranakares, fronted by a sign that reads Viroon Ice Cream in Thai). You can choose oyster (hoi nangrom) or pork kidney, but the most popular option is the seabass (pla krapong). Boiled blood cockles (hoi klang) are probably not the first thing you think of when you consider of Thai street food. Yet the unassuming vendor Jay Sri (Soi Pra Nakares) has managed to stick around for decades, thanks to the freshness of her cockles and the hot-sour deliciousness of the chilli dipping sauce. A spicy-tart salad of water mimosa (yum pak krachade, reminiscent of raw asparagus) is another local favourite. The dessert kanom pang sankaya (steamed bread with coconut custard dipping sauce) is one of Thailand\u2019s favourite roadside treats, but finding a vendor that stands out is difficult. Sangkaya Bread by Chai (506/1 Soi Pranakares) is probably helped by his proximity to the fish porridge shophouse, but his consistently creamy sangkaya sauce also helps.

Last month, Cambodia\u2019s interior minister, Sar Kheng, said two Rohingya men had expressed an interest in moving to Cambodia. The government then began processing their paperwork. Asked if the new arrival was Rohingyan, Lowry said he was \u201cnot in a position to disclose his provenance\u2014except to say that he has come from Nauru\u2014nor anything else about him, because of confidentiality rules.\u201d The Rohingya, a Muslim ethnic minority in Myanmar, face severe and systemic persecution in that country.  Cambodia\u2019s interior ministry spokesman General Khieu Sopheak and General Tan Sovichea, director of the refugee department, could not be reached. Australia\u2019s deal with Cambodia has been controversial, chiefly because of sustained allegations of human rights abuses committed by its government, and the country\u2019s poor record of dealing with refugees.   Related: One of four refugees sent to Cambodia under $55m deal 'wants to go home'    Australia offered Cambodia an additional $40m in aid as an inducement to sign up to the deal, and, in addition, has paid, already, $15m in resettlement costs, for, so far, five people. The first group of four refugees arrived in Phnom Penh in June, but one, a Myanmarese man in his 20s, was unhappy living in Cambodia and opted to return home to Myanmar, reportedly for family reasons. Three Iranians in that group, who were previously housed in a sprawling villa on the outskirts of Phnom Penh, have since been moved to other accommodation in the city.

Related: Asia's Aids epidemic needs urgent action to prevent even more deaths    The two-year study found that smartphone dating apps have expanded the options for spontaneous casual sex as never before.

Related: More than 15m people on life-saving HIV drugs, report says    \u201cYoung gay men themselves have consistently told us that they are now using mobile dating apps to meet up for sex, and are having more casual sex with more people as a result. We know that this kind of risky behaviour increases the spread of HIV,\u201d said Wing-Sie Cheng, HIV/Aids adviser for Unicef in east Asia and the Pacific. \u201cWe are therefore convinced that there is a link, and that we need to work better with mobile app providers to share information about HIV and protect the health of adolescents.\u201d The previously unreported epidemic threatens the UN\u2019s goal to end the global Aids crisis by 2030, which appeared achievable after a sharp drop in Africa during the past 15 years. Adolescents are also more likely to die of Aids-related deaths, researchers from Unicef and UNAIDS found, as they are less inclined to seek treatment, fearing they will be stigmatised or forced to expose their sexuality to their family or the authorities. In many countries in the region, under-18s cannot get an HIV test without parental consent.   Dating site visits   While global HIV infections are falling, the number of adolescents aged 10-19 officially living with HIV in Asia and the Pacific has grown to more than 220,000, with the unofficial number expected to be much higher, Unicef says. Fewer than half of them are receiving treatment and deaths have risen nearly every year for a decade. An HIV-positive Filipino man aged 30, speaking on condition of anonymity to protect himself from abuse, said it was hard to find sex for a gay teenager, bullied at school and closed off from the adult-only gay bars. At university, the introduction of internet dating \u2014 chat rooms and online forums \u2014 allowed him to find more sexual partners his age. He would chat with men and agree to rent a room for a few hours in the capital. \u201cIf I write down all the people I had sex with in Manila, I can probably write one to five people for each stop of the metro,\u201d he said. Smartphones and mobile dating revolutionised his sex life.

If you\u2019re fine with them, you just go and have sex.\u201d The immediacy of the sex, organised in minutes, made condom use less likely, he said. \u201cI did use condoms. But it was not consistent. You don\u2019t want to lose the momentum.\u201d Despite his promiscuous mobile dating years, the Filipino man\u2019s HIV test returned negative and he entered into a long-term relationship. But two years later he contracted the virus from his boyfriend who was secretly cheating on him by using mobile dating apps. In the Philippines, new HIV infections among teenagers have doubled in four years. In Bangkok, young gay men now have a one in three chance of HIV infection.    HIV rates in Bangkok   And eighteen countries across the Asia-Pacific region criminalise against same-sex relationships \u2014 which UNAIDS says causes gay men to avoid life-saving HIV services. A separate study last year found that men who have sex with men using dating apps are at greater risk of contracting gonorrhoea and chlamydia than those who meet in-person or on the internet. Wing-Sie, the Unicef adviser, said that dating apps create networks of men, in which infections rapidly spread among users. \u201cMobile dating apps essentially hook you up to a central network.\u201d She said the study looked at observational trends around the region reported by United Nations officers and local community workers who said their HIV strategy urgently needed to adapt to the explosion of mobile dating apps. \u201cHIV is a covert issue, it is very hidden. So data is not available.\u201d She said researchers found \u201cthat with the rise of these apps, the probability and risk of infection will increase multifold because it makes it so much easier for them to date other guys and hook up for sex,\u201d she said. A spokesman from Grindr, used in 196 countries worldwide with 1 million active users every minute, said it has a minimum age requirement of 18. \u201cAs the world\u2019s largest gay platform, we take matters of sexual health very seriously,\u201d the spokesman said, adding that Grindr runs in-app announcements encouraging testing at local clinics. David S Novak, senior health strategist at Online Buddies, the parent company of the dating app Jack\u2019d, directed the Guardian to its ManHunt Cares project, which provides health resources to its users. In 2009, the company also set up a research institute focusing on gay sexual health.

Analysis of images uploaded publicly on to Instagram in September found that the London style of selfie-taking was one of a restrained upright pose. Using facial-recognition software and ranking the most happy as 1 and the least as 0, London selfies were found to have a score of 0.55, compared with the average of 0.62 across Berlin, New York, S\u00e3o Paulo, Moscow and Bangkok. The figures will form part of an exhibition at London\u2019s Somerset House. The show, Big Bang Data, which opens in early December, explores the explosion of social media and asks what it reveals about modern society. A team of data scientists, designers and researchers collected 152,462 pictures tagged within a 5km sq area around Somerset House over the period of one week, 640 of which were deemed to be selfies. Moritz Stefaner, a data designer who worked on the project, said analysing selfies had proved they were \u201cvery rich\u201d as a data source, both in terms of what they could reveal about different cultures in different cities and illustrating how people wanted to be perceived. \u201cThe sheer number of images we collected, sometimes 300 from a single place in a day, makes you realise how much people are obsessed with documenting everything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are all part of a photo explosion and I think it is really exciting how the world is being documented, in a way that it has never been before, by its inhabitants.\u201d The pictures used for the project were all taken from the public domain, meaning that anyone who recently took a selfie in the vicinity could walk into the Somerset House exhibition and find their own photo as part of the installation.  \u201cI really hope that someone walks into the show and sees their own selfie in the project\u201d said Stefaner. \u201cA big part of the project is to really bring home to people both what can happen with the data they upload publicly, but also how that can be read, using facial-recognition technology or analysis, and what that can say.\u201d The analysis found that twice as many women as men are selfie-takers in London. London men who took selfies tended to be older than those in other cities, averaging about 28 years old, and people of both genders favoured an upright pose over a jaunty angle. The average head tilt of a London selfie was just 15 degrees, compared with 20 degrees elsewhere. Almost double the proportion of people were found to be wearing glasses in London than in the five other cities analysed. And Londoners\u2019 technique is still lacking, as London-based selfies feature the highest proportion of eyes closed \u2013 28% compared with 20% in the other six cities. Claire Catterall, director of exhibitions at Somerset House, attributed the unhappy selfie faces of Londoners not to being miserable but \u201cthinking they are too cool to smile\u201d. Despite the seemingly light-hearted nature of the research, Catterall emphasised that there was \u201ca serious point to be made about the amount of data we willingly put into the public domain online\u201d. She said: \u201cFor me, the most interesting thing is the amount of data you can get from posting something like a selfie is what people don\u2019t really understand and don\u2019t really think about it. There can be some quite serious consequences to posting all this data for everybody to see. We are defined by data in a way we have never been before.\u201d Catterall said the selfie has now become a key piece of data to document an entire generation. She said that by presenting selfies on this public platform as part of an artwork, it would emphasise how the people captured live beyond the private screen of their own phone or Instagram feed.  \u201cWhat has been fascinating about this project is to see how we all now quantify ourselves through this data we produce, we push ourselves out and how this has changed the way we communicate with each other,\u201d she said. \u201cThe massive rise of the selfie just proves how visual we have become as a society. Even in the past five years it is already impacting on how we speak and communicate with each other on a person-to-person basis \u2013 and that can be quite a frightening thing to consider.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2015-11-30T20:24:39Z", "tags": ["Photography", "Social media", "Data and computer security", "Exhibitions", "London", "Art and design", "Culture", "UK news", "Digital media", "Media", "Instagram", "Technology", "Cities"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/30/london-selfies-glummer-study-big-bang-data", "title": "London selfies glummer, less tilted and more bespectacled, study finds", "sentences": ["Using facial-recognition software and ranking the most happy as 1 and the least as 0, London selfies were found to have a score of 0.55, compared with the average of 0.62 across Berlin, New York, S\u00e3o Paulo, Moscow and Bangkok."]}, {"article": "Parul Akter travelled across Bangladesh to escape the flood waters, but they seem to have followed her.

In the coming decades, millions more \u201cclimate refugees\u201d around the world are expected to make similar journeys. In a cruel irony, many will wind up in cities even more ill-equipped to withstand the changing climate.     Parul Akter and her daughter in Dhaka\u2019s Korail slum. Photograph: Poppy McPherson    Bangladesh contributes just 0.4 metric tonnes per capita to the carbon emissions fuelling climate change (the US produces 17 and the UK 7.1), but will suffer its effects badly. Within three decades, the country is expected to be at least 2C hotter. By 2080, the seas could be 2ft higher. The glaciers in the Himalayas will melt faster, sending more floodwaters to batter the Bay of Bengal. Cyclones will wrack the coast more frequently, and with more intensity. Salty seawater will pollute drinking supplies. Fertile land will be destroyed.    In a cruel irony, many refugees will wind up in cities even more ill-equipped to withstand the changing climate    Some of this is already happening. There have not been many studies indisputably tying Bangladesh\u2019s rural exodus to climate. But research indicates that the majority of migrants hail from coastal areas that are already experiencing rising sea levels, increased salinity, destructive floods and cyclones. At least 400,000 people move to Dhaka every year, according to the World Bank, while the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) estimates that 70% of Dhaka\u2019s slum-dwellers moved there fleeing some sort of environmental shock. In 2012, A S Moniruzzaman Khan, the director of the Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Research at BRAC University, tracked 1,500 families migrating to cities, mostly Dhaka. Almost all cited the changing environment as the biggest reason for their decision. They were struggling to find fresh water to drink, as rising seas spilled into rivers.  \u201cTen years back, the area was freshwater \u2013 now it is not,\u201d Khan said. He heard of women and children having to walk an extra five hours each day to find clean water. The task was considered too dangerous, so men went instead \u2013 taking a sizeable chunk out of the earnings of the family\u2019s main breadwinner. \u201cIf you provide water, this migration issue would probably never come,\u201d said Khan.     The banks of Dhaka\u2019s Buriganga River. Photograph: Poppy McPherson    It\u2019s not just Bangladesh. All over the world, people are or will be on the move \u2013 in Africa, largely due to drought; in Asia, floods. By 2060, there could be between 25 million and 1 billion environmental migrants. And cities will be their primary destination. Foresight, a UK government research body, says that by 2060 there will be 192 million more people living in vulnerable urban coastal floodplains, mainly in Asia. \u201cThose moving to water-stressed or low-lying coastal cities in developing countries may paradoxically find themselves exposed to greater climate-change related risks,\u201d a 2014 report by IOM reads.  Part of the problem is population. Asia\u2019s megacities show no signs of shrinking, even as rising sea levels render them more vulnerable to storm surges.  A 2011 study of the 20 most populous cities expected to be exposed to coastal flooding by 2070 placed Dhaka third, behind Mumbai and Calcutta. Also in the top 10 are Guangzhou, Ho Chi Min City, Shanghai, Bangkok and Yangon. Miami is the only city in a developed country to feature on the list.  But despite the challenges, solutions for environmental migrants rarely feature on urban development plans. Climate refugees still have no legal standing under international law. No binding global agreements contain provisions for them, despite the first assessment report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 1990 suggesting that \u201cthe gravest effects of climate change may be those on human migration\u201d.  Specialists had hoped that the climate talks in Paris starting on 30 November would persuade countries to prioritise the issue. But environmental migration has reportedly been removed from the final agenda, though it could be reintroduced during negotiations.

Photograph: Munir Uz Zaman/AFP/Getty Images    \u2018Every city has a carrying capacity\u2019  In Dhaka, meanwhile, a teeming megacity of more than 15 million people packed into a 325 sq km radius, the climate refugees are finding a city where everything is clogged \u2013 from roads and pavements to rivers and drains.  The slums, already home to hundreds of thousands, are expanding rapidly. Within two decades, the city\u2019s population could double to 30 million.    Within three decades, Bangladesh is expected to be at least 2C hotter. By 2080, the seas could be 2ft higher    \u201cEvery boat has a carrying capacity, every city has a carrying capacity,\u201d said Sarder Shafiqul Alam, a senior researcher at the International Centre for Climate Change and Development and Bangladesh\u2019s representative at the Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s Asian Climate Change Resilience Network. \u201cIf that carrying capacity is over-burdened and over-burdened, what will happen? Boat will capsize. City will do something like that.\u201d  People coming to Dhaka after environmental disasters face more problems, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting enough safe water to drink; they\u2019re not getting sanitation facilities.\u201d In yet another irony, even though Dhaka is prone to flooding, it is also running dry. About 90% of the city\u2019s water supplies come from ground reserves, which are depleted by three metres a year. There\u2019s a supply-demand gap of 500m litres a day, according to a 2014 report, leading to chronic shortages and protests in the summer months.     Members of the Devi family sit on a bed above floodwaters in the village of Chajan Mania. Photograph: Gideon Mendel/Corbis     Long-term groundwater depletion causes the earth to sink, which exacerbates flooding, a major problem in Dhaka. It can also lead to the intrusion of salty water into the supply \u2013 the same problem that contributes to rural-urban migration. On the face of it, climate change is poised to be the latest disaster to cripple Bangladesh, a nation that has been beset by compounding crises since it was founded in 1971.  But Bangladeshis are accustomed to bouncing back. Or, as Khan puts it: \u201cOur people like to face challenges.\u201d  The country boasts the world\u2019s largest non-profit, BRAC, and is the birthplace of micro-finance, thanks to Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus. Armies of field workers have responded to climate challenges with innovation. Farmers whose salt-washed land is unfit to grow regular rice have turned to salt-tolerant strains, or raised shrimp instead. And there has been a concerted effort to persuade villagers not to leave their homes.   Related: Climate change and cities: a prime source of problems, yet key to a solution    Some people argue, however, that environmental migrants have a legal claim to be resettled on public land. S M Mahmudul Hasan, 55, a community leader at Korail, has an encyclopedic knowledge of the residents, mostly families who migrated from places such as Bhola and Barial. \u201cThey have lost their houses in natural disasters and have had no income in the villages,\u201d he said.  Most now eke out a living as street sweepers, rickshaw drivers and domestic workers in slums where they face the constant threat of eviction. They miss the countryside. \u201cLife in the village was good,\u201d said Helena Akter, whose home in Barisal was swallowed by the river. \u201cWe had land to cultivate and our family lived happy all year round.

But unlike his colleagues, who were abducted in China, Gui vanished in Thailand. Since his suspected abduction, Gui has been in on-off contact with his wife, daughter and the building manager from the luxury Thai condominium, although he never reveals his location and calls from phone lines are diverted through foreign countries.      The Thailand apartment of Gui Minhai, virtually unchanged since the day he vanished. Photograph: Oliver Holmes for the Guardian    China\u2019s expatriate critics have long avoided the mainland but Beijing \u2014 which unlike the US and Russia does not have a long history of cloak-and-dagger activities outside its borders \u2014 is increasingly tracking down opponents abroad. Chinese president Xi Jinping launched Operation Fox Hunt last year to repatriate Chinese fugitives abroad and has since brought home hundreds of people wanted by Beijing, mostly on corruption charges.     The apartment block in the Thai beach resort town of Pattaya where Gui Minhai lived. Photograph: Oliver Holmes for the Guardian    The campaign has drawn ire from Washington, which says covert agents have been secretly operating out of the US, and has also upset officials in Australia, another of Xi\u2019s key hunting grounds. While it is not certain that Gui, also a naturalised Swedish citizen, was smuggled back to China by the government, his disappearance spotlights the danger for China\u2019s targets, particularly in Thailand where the willing-to-please junta has deported more than 100 people wanted by Beijing this year. An investigation by the Guardian has found that despite CCTV footage of the men suspected of kidnapping Gui and requests from the Swedish government to help find him, there is very little to suggest Thai authorities are following up on the case at all. A member of the management team at the condominium, a mammoth pillared structure on the beach in the Thai resort town Pattaya with attached tennis courts and pool, told the Guardian that apart from a Bangkok-based friend of Gui\u2019s no one had inquired in person or on the phone about his disappearance.  On his last morning, she said, a man who did not speak fluent Thai and speaking Chinese on the phone waited at the apartment gates while Gui was out buying groceries. When Gui returned, he parked the car in the driveway, briefly spoke to the man and then told the security guard to deliver the shopping to his apartment, the manager said. The unidentified man got in Gui\u2019s car and they drove out, security footage showed.           CCTV shows Gui Minhai arriving home on day he disappeared    A few hours later, in the first of several bizarrely mundane calls she would receive from Gui or his assumed captors during his suspected abduction, he called the desk and asked her to put the fruit in the fridge and lock all the windows. The next call was two weeks later, when he said a friend would pick up his computer. A day later, four men \u2014 captured on CCTV dressed casually with only one wearing a hat and sunglasses \u2014 arrived at the building. \u201cOnly two could speak Thai,\u201d the manager said, speaking to the Guardian on rattan chairs in the open-air lobby, feet away from where Gui drove off. They wrote Chinese names in the log book and brought a note they said was written by Gui giving them permission to take the computer. They spent 26 minutes in the apartment, camera footage in the elevator showed, but left the Mac on Gui\u2019s desk. They later called to say the airconditioning had accidentally been left on. Only days later did the manager hear that Gui was uncontactable. She immediately retrieved the number the men had used to call her and dialled it.   Sage disappearances   \u201cA taxi driver picked up. He said that that phone was left in the car by four men.\u201d The driver said they were trying to negotiate a price for a taxi to Poipet, a Cambodian border town notorious for its bribable immigration officials. She received one more call from Gui but he hung up after she asked if he was safe. The Guardian called three phone numbers Gui had used to call the manager. One was from Croatia, another from Poland and the last from Togo. All were disconnected. The number the four men used was Thai, but also cut off. The salacious publisher As a publisher of the thinly-sourced, tabloid-style political books which pack the shelves of Hong Kong bookstores but are outlawed in mainland China, Gui, 51, became a major thorn in the Communist party\u2019s side.  His salacious and, many suspect, largely fabricated tales focused on the private lives of senior party leaders.  The books chronicled the alleged sexual escapades of Bo Xilai, the disgraced party chief of Chongqing whose wife, Gu Kailai, was jailed for the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood. They took on Zhou Yongkang, China\u2019s once feared security tsar who was jailed for life for corruption earlier this year. Even Chinese president Xi Jinping found his name dragged into Gui\u2019s pages, with one recent book entitled The Collapse of Xi Jinping in 2017. Lee Bo, Gui\u2019s Hong Kong-based business partner, said his friend had been responsible for publishing about 200 books in the last nine years. \u201cHe\u2019s quite prolific,\u201d he said, denying, however, that Gui was on a political mission against the Communist party. \u201cHe\u2019s mainly a businessman. Publishing to him is a means of earning money rather than ideology,\u201d he said. \u201cIn his books there is a lot of guessing also about political gossip rather than actual fact.\u201d  Gui had done well out of his almost decade-long career in publishing. He owned homes in Hong Kong and Germany and in late 2014 acquired his retreat in Pattaya. Lee Bo had been invited to spend next year\u2019s Chinese New Year there with his wife. \u201cIt was in a good environment, in front of a beach, with a 180-degree sea view and it was quite cheap compared to properties in Hong Kong. He thought it was a really good buy. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what happened and we don\u2019t know who has taken him, whether they were Chinese or Thai. Nothing is clear,\u201d Lee Bo said.     Gui Minhai, whose salacious and, many suspect, largely fabricated books irritated Communist party cadres, in an undated picture. Photograph: Bei Ling/Independent Chinese PEN Center    However, three theories for why Gui disappeared have emerged. One is that the apparent abduction was linked to a particularly racy book Gui had been preparing to send to the printers. Some believe powerful mainland figures may have ordered members of the Chinese mafia in Pattaya to snatch the publisher. \u201cSo we all suspect it has something to do with his upcoming book,\u201d Lee said. Gui had kept the contents of the book a complete secret. \u201cNobody knows. Not even the name do we know. \u201cI think it must be one of his books or many [of his] books offended some high ranking Chinese officials, possibly Chinese leaders,\u201d he added.  Asked how senior members of the Communist party felt about Gui, Lee said: \u201cCertainly they don\u2019t like him. But to publish this kind of book which is critical of the Chinese regime is not unusual in Hong Kong \u2026 Why is Mr Gui singled out? Probably he has some kind of books \u2013 or a book \u2013 the Chinese leadership must get rid of. It\u2019s the only reason I can think of.\u201d  Another source in Hong Kong\u2019s publishing industry said many believed Gui\u2019s disappearance was the result of a \u201cpersonal vendetta\u201d by powerful mainland figures who had been irritated by Gui\u2019s books. \u201cThey see him as a nuisance,\u201d said the source, who declined to be named. \u201cThey take it personally.\u201d Others in the dissident community believe it was the government itself that ordered Gui\u2019s abduction.  The Cambodia theory Bei Ling, a Chinese dissident who lives in the US, first met Gui in 1984 at Peking University. They were both young poets. \u201cI cannot say he is in China for sure because we don\u2019t have any real evidence. But all these things make me very easily imagine this is the case.\u201d He said Gui thought Thailand would be a safe place to work. The key detail in the story, Bei Ling believes, is the taxi to Poipet. \u201cThe captors wanted to get to Cambodia to easily get him back to China.\u201d Only a few days after the four men visited Gui\u2019s apartment \u2014 ostensibly to retrieve the computer they never picked up \u2014 Cambodia deported 168 Chinese suspects it said were involved in an internet and phone scam back to China on two planes sent from Beijing. \u201cIt make sense,\u201d Bei Ling says. \u201cThey went to the apartment to get the passport, not the computer. Then they would send Gui back to China through Cambodia on the plane of criminals.\u201d But it is also possible that Gui disappeared himself.      A bookshop at Hong Kong airport stocked with dozens of salacious tomes about China\u2019s top leaders, including one by Gui Minhai predicting the downfall of president Xi Jinping. Photograph: Tom Phillips for the Guardian    Gui\u2019s daughter, who asked not to use her first name, said she received a peculiar Skype message from her father after he went missing saying he would transfer money, which did later arrive in her account. \u201cI hadn\u2019t asked for money and he didn\u2019t address my previous messages asking him where he was and if he was OK. \u201cHe has been calling his wife, my stepmother, regularly telling her that he is fine but not answering any questions regarding his whereabouts.\u201d  But she said she doesn\u2019t think Gui orchestrated his disappearance. \u201cWe were planning to talk again a couple days after he went missing. I\u2019m fairly sure if he had planned to do that, he would have told me.\u201d Gabriel Wernstedt from the Swedish ministry of foreign affairs told the Guardian its embassies in Bangkok and Beijing are investigating and had \u201craised the issue with high-level Thai representatives\u201d. But police captain Pichitpong Yodpikul in Pattaya said that while a daily log had been recorded, the police cannot act until a family member files an official police report. A copy of the daily log seen by the Guardian said Gui\u2019s family \u201care afraid that he is in danger\u201d. Gui\u2019s daughter said Swedish police had already filed a report through Interpol: \u201cInterpol were supposed to put pressure on Thailand.\u201d When told that not a single police officer or government official had visited the apartment, she said: \u201cThe fact that nobody has been down, that is worrying.\u201d Requests for comment sent by the Guardian to the Thai ministry of foreign affairs and a Thai government spokesman were unsuccessful. Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the ministry of foreign affairs in Beijing, declined to comment when asked if the Chinese government had any information on Gui\u2019s disappearance or whereabouts. She also declined to comment on the suggestion that the Chinese government might have been involved in Gui\u2019s detention.  \u201cI\u2019m not aware of the specific case that you mentioned,\u201d Hua told the Guardian on Monday.  Ditching Washington for Beijing Under Thailand\u2019s coup leaders, the country has strengthened ties with China, including signing an agreement to boost joint military engagement and intelligence sharing over the next five years.  Last month, Thai and Chinese military conducted joint air force drills. A Chinese-built rail network through Thailand is being planned while Bangkok looks likely to spend $1bn on Chinese submarines. With Washington speaking out on human rights, a thinned-skinned military junta in power means Bangkok is looking to Beijing. Despite Obama calling for a \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia, the relationship with Thailand is souring. Asked by the Guardian about Chinese influence in southeast Asia, US ambassador Glyn Davies said it was a \u201cgood thing\u201d for Thailand to have a healthy relationship with China. He said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t lost Thailand.\u201d Last month, Thailand deported two veteran Chinese dissidents and registered refugees back to China, angering rights groups and the UN. And in July, it deported about 100 ethnic Uighur Muslims back to China. The UNHCR said at the time that the expulsion was \u201ca flagrant violation of international law\u201d. The Chinese ambassador to Thailand Ning Fukui said this month that the deportation of the two Chinese men \u201cfollowed security cooperation between the two countries.\u201d \u201cChina is Thailand\u2019s number one trade partner \u2026 I have felt true brotherhood with Thai people,\u201d he said. Paul Chambers, director of the Institute of Southeast Asian Affairs, said the deportations show Thailand\u2019s willingness \u201cto curry favour with a Chinese regime which is all too willing to violate any laws of the world simply to silence dissent and freedom of speech against its domestic critics. \u201cThe Thai dictatorship will talk the talk of protecting human rights and cracking down on human trafficking but it will not walk the walk,\u201d he said. \u201cMost probably, Thailand\u2019s relations with China will continue to improve while those with the US will deteriorate.\u201d A recent editorial by the Bangkok Post wrote \u201cevery Thai knows the government is bowing to China\u2019s demands\u201d and Thailand\u2019s former foreign minister in July said if his Chinese counterpart \u201cwere a woman I will fall in love with his excellency.\u201d More covert operations might have taken place, too. In October, the 16-year-old son of a prominent human rights lawyer at the centre of a Chinese government crackdown disappeared while attempting to flee to the US through southeast Asia.

Irrespective of actual evidence, China expects other countries to accept uncritically that the individuals sought are invariably \u201ccriminals\u201d, who have violated Chinese law. And if anyone, including the UN, questions this, Beijing reacts angrily and calls it interference. This scenario is playing out with increasing frequency around the world as Beijing slowly erodes one of international law\u2019s key principles: the prohibition against returning people to a place where they could face persecution or other serious human rights violations. It evades questions about its record on torture, the lack of independence of its judiciary, or the fact that many Chinese laws violate fundamental universal human rights principles such as freedom of expression, movement or religion.   Related: UN condemns Thai repatriation of Chinese dissidents    Last month, two Chinese pro-democracy activists, Dong Guangping and Jiang Yefei, were forcibly returned from Thailand, with the collusion of the authorities in Bangkok. The Thai government wilfully ignored the fact that the two men had been officially recognised as refugees by the UN\u2019s refugee agency, the UNHCR, and had already been accepted for resettlement in Canada. And make no mistake as to what the two activists have been sent back to: a country carrying out an unprecedented crackdown against human rights lawyers, government critics and NGOs. Hundreds of peaceful activists have been persecuted and thrown in jail after unfair trials since President Xi Jinping took power in late 2012. A week after their forced return, Dong Guangping and Jiang Yefei were paraded on Chinese state television confessing to breaking immigration laws. Both men are criminally detained and at the mercy of a criminal justice system where torture and other ill-treatment to extract \u201cconfessions\u201d remains widespread. Their forcible return is part of a growing pattern, as China casts its net beyond its borders to round up critics and others that have sought sanctuary abroad. In itself this threatens, among other things, core principles on the protection of refugees, a bedrock of international law.  Many, like Thailand\u2019s military rulers, but also the governments in Cambodia, Pakistan or central Asian countries, appear all too eager to help \u2013 in clear contravention of their own international obligations to protect those seeking refuge. The Chinese government maintains that it is only seeking the return of suspected criminals, including terrorists and those wanted for corruption. But none of these claims should be taken at face value. For example, while China has legitimate concerns about violence and terrorism in Xinjiang in the north-west of the country, the authorities have lost credibility by politicising and distorting the real nature of this threat. By systematically conflating concepts such as \u201cseparatism\u201d, \u201cextremism\u201d and \u201cterrorism\u201d with non-violent activism, it is not only those who advocate violence who have become targets of the authorities\u2019 harsh counter-terrorism policies. It is also peaceful critics of the repressive policies against ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang that have become targets, most notably Uighur academic Ilham Tohti, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2014 on trumped up charges of having set up a \u201cseparatist organisation\u201d.   Related: Ilham Tohti should get the Nobel peace prize, not life in prison | Teng Biao    Earlier this year, the Thai authorities forcibly returned some 109 people, mostly Uighurs, to China \u2013 despite the serious risk of torture if sent back. Chinese state media said they were on their way to Iraq or Syria to \u201cwage holy war\u201d, yet provided no evidence to back up these accusations against a group that also counted many young children. Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia also appear to have forcibly sent back Uighurs to China. Once in Xinjiang, many of these individuals, like other Uighurs accused of terrorism and religious extremism, face enforced disappearances, lengthy detention and unfair trials behind closed doors. The persecution of government critics is only likely to intensify as President Xi\u2019s China pushes through a series of sweeping new laws and regulations on national security. China\u2019s proposed anti-terrorism law, for instance, has virtually no safeguards to prevent those who peacefully practise their religion or simply criticise government policies from being persecuted under vague charges of terrorism or extremism. The definition of terrorism includes \u201cthought, speech, or behaviour\u201d aimed at \u201cinfluencing national policy-making\u201d, \u201csubverting state power\u201d or \u201csplitting the country\u201d. And we should also remember that Xi\u2019s flagship anti-corruption drive, which is also aimed at individuals abroad living off the proceeds of their crimes, is fundamentally a political campaign, with no independent judiciary to act as a safeguard. Most of the anti-corruption work takes place in the shadows, driven solely by the Chinese Communist party\u2019s internal discipline machine, beyond any scrutiny. The campaign has also been marked by numerous suicides, regular show trials and unexplained deaths in detention. Beijing might call it justice, but most wouldn\u2019t. As China extends its crackdown beyond its borders, the international community must reject the Chinese authorities\u2019 claims of \u201ctrust us\u201d. No government should take China\u2019s reassurances at face value. Instead they should ask difficult questions and ensure people receive the protection afforded to them under international law and are not sent back to be tortured and persecuted. As for China, bringing its judicial system in line with international law and standards, starting with allowing lawyers to play a meaningful role in judicial proceedings and putting an end to the endemic torture of criminal suspects, would be a much more fruitful way to work towards the legitimate goal of increasing judicial cooperation with foreign governments.

The diplomatic breakthrough by two countries that regularly exchange fire across their contested borders was announced at the end of a regional summit in Islamabad where officials also hinted at a possible revival of talks between the Afghan government and \u201cTaliban groups\u201d. The restarting of a \u201ccomprehensive bilateral dialogue\u201d was announced by India\u2019s top diplomat Sushma Swaraj, the first Indian foreign minister to visit Pakistan since 2012. High-ranking officials from the nuclear-armed neighbours have held precious few meetings since the election of Narendra Modi as prime minister of India in May 2014 given his government\u2019s insistence that talks focus on battling terrorism and not the contested region of Kashmir, a key Pakistan concern. On Wednesday Swaraj not only met with Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani prime minister, and his top foreign affairs adviser, but also agreed to start a dialogue process that would include Kashmir and other border disputes. Pakistan said it was taking steps to bring about the \u201cearly conclusion\u201d of the stalled trial of those involved in the 2008 terror attacks on Mumbai, India\u2019s financial capital, which was masterminded by Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistani militant group. Earlier in the day Swaraj told representatives of 31 countries gathered for the Heart of Asia conference on the future of Afghanistan that it was time for India and Pakistan to display \u201cthe maturity and self-confidence to do business with each other and strengthen regional trade and cooperation\u201d. She added: \u201cThe entire world is waiting and rooting for a change. Let us not disappoint them.\u201d The change in tack had been presaged by a closed-door meeting in Bangkok on Sunday between the two countries\u2019 national security advisers, which itself followed an informal conversation between Modi and Sharif on the sidelines of the Paris climate change conference the week before. Analysts said India softened its position after a string of state elections when it was in the interest of Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party to strike a hawkish, populist line against Pakistan.   Related: Afghanistan security 'undermined by efforts to crush Pakistani militants'    In a busy day of diplomacy, the Heart of Asia summit also saw officials from leading countries hint at fresh talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government which were abandoned after just one round this summer. Antony J Blinken, US deputy secretary of state, said the Afghan and Pakistani leaders renewed their commitment to an \u201cAfghan owned and Afghan led\u201d process during meetings with senior diplomats from the US and China, in a sign of the powerful international pressures for a peaceful end to the war. Blinken said the first Pakistani-brokered meeting between Afghan officials and authorised Taliban representatives in a hill town near Islamabad on 8 July had been a \u201cvery significant development\u201d and there was a \u201cclear desire to return to that process\u201d. Salahuddin Rabbani, the Afghan foreign minister, said he hoped to see positive moves in the coming weeks on peace talks. There are doubts over how quickly the talks can begin given the violent splits that developed within the Taliban after it was revealed in late July that the insurgency\u2019s spiritual leader Mullah Omar had been dead for two years. News of Omar\u2019s death triggered a sharp increase in attacks in Afghanistan as the Taliban\u2019s new leader Mullah Mansoor attempted to assert his authority over a movement divided over both his leadership and the wisdom of negotiating with the Kabul government. In a statement Pakistan\u2019s foreign ministry appeared to recognise the divisions by explicitly referring to multiple Taliban groups. Pakistan \u201cwill work to create conditions that encourage participation of Taliban groups in a peace process that demonstrates to them that they have a real option of political engagement\u201d, it said. The surge in violence, which many in Afghanistan believe is caused by clandestine Pakistani support for the rebels, heaped pressure on Ashraf Ghani, the Afghan president, to abandon his policy of making concessions to Islamabad to gain Pakistan\u2019s backing for peace talks. Afghanistan\u2019s enduring security crisis was highlighted on the eve of Ghani\u2019s arrival in Islamabad when 37 people were killed during a Taliban attack on Kandahar airport, a major civilian and military hub in the country\u2019s south. Ghani told the conference that steps taken by Pakistan against terrorism had further undermined Afghan security by flushing ever more militants across the border. He said Afghan special forces had been forced to launch more than 40 operations against the TTP and that the country was now a hotbed of international jihadi. \u201cAl-Qaida, [Isis] and terrorists from China, Russia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, the Middle East are all, unfortunately, present on our soil,\u201d he said. Aziz Ahmed Khan, a former Pakistani ambassador to both Kabul and New Delhi, said there was now a \u201cray of hope\u201d for improved relations with India. However bitter experience meant \u201cyou should never be overly enthusiastic because you never know where the next stumbling block will come\u201d, he said. Khan doubted there would be an immediate resumption of talks with the Taliban saying there now needed to be an \u201cintra-Taliban reconciliation process\u201d. \u201cAshraf Ghani probably did have reason to be upset with us so the fact that he has come here and everyone has talked at the highest level is something,\u201d he said.", "publicationDate": "2015-12-09T19:30:49Z", "tags": ["India", "Pakistan", "Afghanistan", "South and Central Asia", "World news", "Kashmir"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/09/pakistan-and-india-agree-to-resume-diplomatic-dialogue", "title": "Pakistan and India agree to resume diplomatic dialogue", "sentences": ["Let us not disappoint them.\u201d The change in tack had been presaged by a closed-door meeting in Bangkok on Sunday between the two countries\u2019 national security advisers, which itself followed an informal conversation between Modi and Sharif on the sidelines of the Paris climate change conference the week before."]}, {"article": "Thai police are considering a defamation case against a former officer tasked with investigating human trafficking who says he fled for his life after he found senior figures in the military and police were involved in the trade.   Related: Revealed: Thailand's most senior human trafficking investigator to seek political asylum in Australia    Major General Paween Pongsirin told Guardian Australia and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that he was in Australia to claim political asylum as powerful figures now wanted to kill him. Royal Thai Police chief Jakthip Chaijinda told journalists on Friday that a legal team was checking to see if his comments were defamatory, a criminal charge in Thailand. \u201cI don\u2019t know the reason why he had to go and speak about this issue but he should not talk about this because it could damage the country,\u201d Jakthip said.  He added that Paween was the only police officer to raise allegations of intimidation.  The south-east Asian nation argues it has made significant efforts to combat the trade, pressing charges against more than 100 people, including an army general, on counts of human trafficking after dozens of bodies were found in a jungle prison camp earlier this year. Many of the exhumed bodies were believed to be Rohingya Muslims, a long-persecuted minority who have been fleeing Myanmar. Paween was appointed to lead the investigation into the grim discovery, which at the time was interpreted as Thailand treating the issue more seriously. His team uncovered a major human trafficking syndicate but he says that \u201cfrom the beginning\u201d he was under pressure not to pursue the perpetrators too enthusiastically. Paween resigned from the force last month after he was transferred against his will to an insurgency-plagued region in the deep south of Thailand. He said traffickers he was pursuing were influential in this region and \u201csenior police\u201d in the area were involved with the trade. He told his superiors that he feared for his life if he were sent there, but says his protests were ignored. The investigation he led was disbanded after just five months.

An Australian editor and a Thai reporter were sued for criminal defamation last year for reporting on the alleged involvement of Thai naval officers in the trafficking of Rohingya refugees.  They were found not guilty in September in the trial that was widely condemned by human rights and media freedom groups. Paween did not name the senior officials he alleges are complicit in the human trafficking trade in Thailand, but says the jungle camps would have needed influential oversight to stay open. \u201cHuman trafficking is a big network that involves lots of the military, politicians and police.

You hear street merchants calling out their catch of the day, maybe a bag of sardines, turbot from the Black Sea or a kilo of mussels. I was there en route to \u00c7iya, in the heart of this picturesque market. \u00c7iya to me embodies the perfect restaurant: full of tradition but not afraid of innovating, with a generous and welcoming space. The meal is a cornucopia of all there is to offer from Anatolia \u2013 lamb stewed with dried cherries, chopped parsley with vinegar, rice cooked with raisins and fistfuls of whole spices... I would happily put myself on a plane just to go and have lunch there on a beautiful spring day. Pickled herring platter at Russ &amp; Daughters, New York Yotam OttolenghiChef and food writer It was a platter of pickled herring fillets with three sauce options on the side \u2013 cream, mustard and curry \u2013 along with schmaltz herring fillets and then matjes herring fillets. In the centre were pickled onions, roll mops and a beet and herring salad. I had it for breakfast, around 11am, and it left a sweet (albeit fishy) taste in my mouth for the next few days. I love the cafe, which opened last year and is strongly modelled on the long-established store. Sardines, chubs, rugelach, pickles, boxes of matzo, halva sold by the block, rye bread to blow your socks off, Bloody Marys: these are the flavours which define New York for me. Idiaz\u00e1bal cheese, Urbia mountains, Spain Elena ArzakChef-patron, Arzak, San Sebasti\u00e1n This spring I made an idiaz\u00e1bal cheese with a shepherd in the Urbia mountains in the Basque country. We used natural rennet which the shepherd made from the stomach of a latxa lamb. When I went to pick my cheese up this autumn (after the ageing process) it had all the rich true flavour of the milk, but you could also sense the environment in which the mother had grazed. I could close my eyes and imagine myself on that windswept mountain top. The fact I made it heightened the flavour. I ate it with my family, either by itself or with walnuts, quince jelly and apple jelly. Dashi-simmered asparagus, tofu and egg at Koya, London Sarit Packer and Itamar SrulovichChef-owners, Honey &amp; Co, London We went to Koya a couple of days before it closed and had an amazing goodbye meal. The asparagus and tofu dish was so delicious, we ordered another for dessert. It had those really fat English asparagus, blanched and chargrilled, with tofu, bonito flakes and a dashi broth. It was so nicely balanced and full of flavour. The next day, Itamar went back with our head chef to eat it all over again. The food in those last days of Koya felt very organic, more like dishes Junya [Yamasaki, the head chef] would make at home than normal restaurant stuff. Sea urchins from County Cork Jacob KenedyChef-patron, Bocca di Lupo, London From now until February or March, you can get amazing sea urchins from Ireland. I had my first one last week and it was mindbogglingly good. You can get warm-water sea urchins, which tend to be bigger and more impressive-looking, all year round, but they are much less intensely flavoured. The Irish ones \u2013 mine came from John Chamberlain in Dunmanus Bay, Co Cork \u2013 have an enveloping fishy flavour. They\u2019re wonderful stirred through pasta or with sushi, but I prefer them on their own with just a tiny squeeze of lemon. You slice them open, clean out the gunky stuff, rinse them in sea water and scoop out the eggs with a teaspoon. It makes you realise how amazing nature is, and how little we should mess with our food. Sea-salt ice cream in Dingle, County Kerry James \u2018Jocky\u2019 PetrieGroup executive development chef, Gordon Ramsay Group In Dingle this summer, during a chowder competition with lots of Guinness and live music, I tried a sea-salt ice cream at Murphy\u2019s. It was one of those things that makes you go, damn, why didn\u2019t I think of that? Everyone loves salted caramel, but this is different: just plain ice cream with sea salt. It sounds odd but it really works: the sweetness of the sugar balances the salty character. It\u2019s almost savoury but not quite \u2013 it\u2019s just a sweet salt. People come from miles around to eat this ice cream. Lamb k\u00f6fte at Sultanahmet K\u00f6ftecisi, Istanbul Karam SethiChef-patron, Gymkhana, Trishna, London I went to Istanbul for the first time this year and ate at a place called Sultanahmet K\u00f6ftecisi. After visiting the Blue Mosque nearby, we saw the big queue outside and decided to find out what was going on. They specialise in lamb k\u00f6ftes grilled very simply over charcoal and served with bread, pickled chillies and their house chilli paste. We ordered one and ended up having six. It\u2019s tough to find something so succulent and juicy and flavourful. I think it\u2019s down to the quality and fat content of the meat, and that they serve them hot off the grill, so you can still taste the charcoal. They\u2019ve mastered the recipe over years and years. It\u2019s the ultimate kebab.     Yuzu ramen at Afuri, Tokyo. Illustration: Nick Shepherd    Yuzu ramen at Afuri, Tokyo Brett RedmanChef-owner, The Richmond, Elliot\u2019s, Jidori, London On a research visit to Tokyo at the start of the year, I had a yuzu shio-ramen at a place called Afuri in the basement of a shopping centre in Roppongi Hills. I\u2019m not an aficionado but it was the best ramen I\u2019ve ever had. They make it with chicken stock, which makes it much lighter than the rich, milky tonkotsu ramen we\u2019re used to in London. The addition of fresh yuzu is ingenious: the intensity and fragrance of yuzu peel blasts all the way through the stock. It left my head spinning: how do you get so much flavour into this bowl?  Khao chae at Lai Rod, Bangkok Fuchsia DunlopFood writer I was going to recommend a meal at the Dragon Well Manor restaurant in Hangzhou \u2013 every time I go there it\u2019s the best meal of the year \u2013 but then I had something totally amazing today in Bangkok. I was in Thailand for the first time and the food blogger The Skinny Bib recommended I go to an old-school Thai restaurant called Lai Rod. The standout from quite a long lunch was a dish called khao chae: grains of rice in iced water with flower petals, perfumed with candle smoke. It was served with a platter of deep-fried relishes \u2013 green chilli stuffed with pork, fish floss flavoured with coconut, caramelised beef and some salted radish with a little egg yolk \u2013 and beautifully cut pieces of green mango, cucumber and a crunchy yellow root with a remarkable taste. The combination of the sweet, salty and umami flavours from the relishes and the smoky, perfumed rice soup was a revelation. Grilled shrimps at Sa Foradada, Mallorca Tomos ParryHead chef, Kitty Fisher\u2019s, London I went to this fantastic cliffside restaurant this summer. The whole experience is pretty special: you park your car, jump over a fence (which stays closed to keep wild donkeys in) and walk for half an hour through fields with fig trees and goats. The trek is worth it for the food and the view \u2013 you\u2019re looking out over the bay where they catch most of your dinner. I particularly liked the shrimp, cooked very simply over a grill with wood from the trees around the restaurant. A lot of the skill in grilling lies in restraint, and these shrimp were barely cooked, so you can still taste the sea without being overpowered by the wood.     Grilled shrimps at Sa Foradada, Mallorca. Illustration: Nick Shepherd    Unpasteurised cream from Ottinge Court Farm, Kent Stephen HarrisChef-patron, The Sportsman, Seasalter, Kent I\u2019m slightly obsessed with dairy produce and this year I\u2019ve started buying unpasteurised cream from Ottinge Court Farm near Folkestone. We hadn\u2019t been able to get it at the restaurant for about five years because the testing required for unpasteurised milk has become prohibitively expensive for most farms. The difference is just incredible. The pasteurisation process wipes out all the interesting things. In this, I can taste a hint of flowers and a rosewater tone. There\u2019s a slight dung-y taste, which some people find offputting but I really like. You know it has come from a cow as opposed to a goat or a sheep, because it smells a bit like when you get near cows. I\u2019ve been trying it out with a warm chocolate mousse and a tiny bit of salt and that\u2019s probably the best thing I\u2019ve tasted all year. Iio Jozo\u2019s fujisu vinegar, Japan James LoweHead chef, Lyle\u2019s, London In February I visited Iio Jozo, a vinegar-maker outside Kyoto which has been producing rice vinegar for 120 years. They oversee all the parts of the process themselves: they brew their own sake and have local farmers growing the organic rice for them. One thing they do is collect the sake lees \u2013 the fermented rice left over after filtering \u2013 and pile it into big wooden barrels to age for up to 10 years. It starts out as a white, pure-looking paste but by year ten it\u2019s black like treacle. The vinegar he makes from it is incredible. He gave me a litre bottle and, at first, I tried to use it sparingly, but I ended up putting it on lots of things at the restaurant. It was gone within a week. Pasta al forno at La Cantinetta, Barolo, Italy Sam HarrisChef-patron, Zucca, London I\u2019ve been eating at La Cantinetta since I started going to Piedmont 15 years ago \u2013 it\u2019s a very simple little trattoria run by two brothers \u2013 but it was the first time I\u2019d had this dish. They ran it as a special and it was amazing \u2013 a perfect baked pasta. Pasta al forno is basically lasagne, though the woman serving us insisted there was a difference. This one was quite firm and didn\u2019t collapse all over the plate, which is a good thing. There were loads of layers \u2013 we counted about 15 \u2013 and a very scant amount of b\u00e9chamel and meat ragu, but just the right amount. The seasoning was bang on, it was really crisp on the top. I\u2019ve had millions of lasagnes over the years, but this blew my head off. Ochazuke at Ishikawa, Tokyo Isaac McHaleHead chef, the Clove Club, London Ochazuke is a dish of rice, a few bits to sprinkle on top \u2013 seaweed, toasted things, salmon eggs, shiso, whatever you have \u2013 with green tea or dashi poured over it, a Japanese late-night fridge buffet. The fresh rice, the cornerstone of a Japanese meal, was a revelation. It was fragrant, just chewy, almost al dente and made me really pay attention to the rice for the rest of our trip. I\u2019ve been reading about ochazuke in Japanese Cooking: A Simple Art for 18 years and dreaming of a Scottish version, with Assam tea and pheasant broth over barley. To be served one in one of the best restaurants in Japan, made my heart sing. Porcini in Tuscany Ruth RogersChef and co-founder, the River Caf\u00e9, London The family, around 20 of us, go to Tuscany every summer, near Monte Amiata. This year we were there when the first porcini were found. Our gardener brought them for us as a surprise, then I roasted them whole with a bit of garlic and thyme, two hours after they were picked. We put them in the oven for a long time, almost an hour, then ate them with nothing else on the plate. It was the setting as much as the flavour; all of us being there together, the excitement of them arriving. It was late August, so it felt like a farewell to summer and the beginning of autumn. Lobster pasta at Hedone, London Nathan OutlawChef-patron, Restaurant Nathan Outlaw, Port Isaac, Cornwall A lot of people told me Hedone was good, but the lobster pasta was the best thing I\u2019ve ever eaten in England, and I\u2019ve eaten a lot of food in England. It wasn\u2019t so much the cooking as the ingredients. They kill all their seafood fresh to order and that makes all the difference. You don\u2019t get a menu. If you ask Mikael [Jonsson] for one, he says he\u2019ll send it, but never does. But from what I can gather he took the coral from the lobster and put it into the bisque, which was slightly aerated. The pasta was just a flat sheet, almost like lasagna, and cooked perfectly. It\u2019s refreshing to see a chef sticking to his guns and cooking the best produce he can find. The British restaurant scene is much newer than in France or Spain or Italy, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve scratched the surface of what\u2019s possible in our own country, with our own ingredients. Sushi at Masa, New York H\u00e9l\u00e8ne DarrozeChef cuisini\u00e8re, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Darroze at the Connaught, London I was in New York with my chefs to cook a special dinner and we went to Masa. It\u2019s not the kind of place you can go every day \u2013 it\u2019s really expensive \u2013 but it was an experience. You eat at the counter, and they make everything \u00e0 la minute, right in front of you. The best thing was a piece where the chef took a kind of white membrane of the tuna \u2013 not the the meat itself \u2013 and wove it over a piece of rice into a piece of sushi. The rice was a little warm. It was so surprising: very smooth to eat but then the flavour of the tuna was like an explosion in the mouth. Just incredible.

Illustration: Nick Shepherd    Pizza at Mission Chinese, New York Lee TiernanChef-owner, Black Axe Mangal, London I was scared about opening our new restaurant, and Danny Bowien invited me over to spend a few days at Mission Chinese in New York. I always feel calm around Danny. He has a lot on his plate but he just deals with it. The best thing I ate was a cheese and tomato pizza with mapo tofu on top, cooked in their wood oven. The base is made to a Tartine bread recipe, then the tofu is just rolled around on top. It\u2019s quite unusual to have a cheese and tomato DOP pizza on a Chinese restaurant menu, but nothing\u2019s going to stop those guys doing what they want. I think about that pizza every day. I wish I was eating it right now, in fact. Roast lamb in Segovia, Spain Nieves Barrag\u00e1nExecutive chef, Barrafina, London When I went to Segovia, one hour north of Madrid, I went to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda, a family place where they make the best roast mixed lamb on the wood fire. There were six of us; it was a four-hour lunch. We had two things: the lamb, which came with roast kidneys, and the suckling pig, with amazing roast potatoes and grilled peppers on the side. It was stunning: juicy, crisp \u2026 It sounds quite English, but the centre of Spain is like this, it\u2019s very traditional \u2013 all roasts. Their oven is huge, so beautiful \u2013 half the size of Barrafina. I would love to have something like that in London. Tarte tatin in Lamotte-Beuvron, France Shuko OdaHead chef, Koya Bar, London We visited Lamotte-Beuvron, an hour or two from Paris, where tarte tatin is originally from. We went to the local bakery and bought the tarte tatin there. I don\u2019t normally have a sweet tooth but it was absolutely beautiful. It was a nothing-special-but-everything-about-it-was-special type of thing. Goat\u2019s curd mousse at Lyle\u2019s, London Anissa HelouFood writer Lyle\u2019s has been my favourite restaurant more or less since it opened, and a few months ago I took two young Qatari friends for dinner as I wanted them to taste James Lowe\u2019s cooking. It was a perfect meal, ending with an amazing goat\u2019s curd mousse. It was sensational: a little bowl with the mousse on the bottom, covered by an apple granita made with estivale apples and sorrel. The apples weren\u2019t peeled so the flavour was incredibly intense \u2013 but not too sweet. And then there was this beautiful crunchy cracker \u2013 a very, very thin sheet \u2013 made with apple, sugar and star anise. The textures were incredible: creamy, icy and then crackly. My friends loved it. Pizza at Gjusta, Los Angeles Claire PtakOwner, Violet Bakery, London The thing that\u2019s really been on my mind is this pizza we had in Los Angeles at Gjusta [a bakery and caf\u00e9]. It was one of the best, most perfectly seasoned, chewy, crunchy, doughy things I\u2019ve ever eaten. I\u2019ve been dreaming about it. It\u2019s more like pizza bianca that you get in Rome, but thinner. They make it in big rectangular sheet pans. Really salty and oily, and stretched out. The one we ate had tomatoes, red onion, little bits of ricotta, an egg, and just oil and salt. It was transcendent.     Pizza at Gjusta, Los Angeles. Illustration: Nick Shepherd    Grouse from Scotland Blanche VaughanCook and food writer I was standing on a moor in mid-September just when the heather is in flower and I shot a grouse. I plucked it myself, wrapped it up and took it back on the train. It\u2019s a nice thing to be able to cook for other people. I made a recipe I learned at the River Caf\u00e9: you make a bruschetta with roast tomatoes on top, slosh in red wine so it soaks into the bread, then you brown the bird and roast it on top of the bruschetta so all the juices seep in.  Burger at the Four Seasons, New York Fergus HendersonCo-owner, St John, London A perfect burger at the Four Seasons bar in the Seagram Building in New York. I had a dry martini, which is a good way to start lunch, and a very nice pinot noir to wash it down. A real treat. It was a classic burger but it\u2019s the setting: it\u2019s a beautiful room, a special place. They have chainmail on the windows, which shimmers. The bar has amazing spikes hanging above it, so everything they serve could be the last thing you ever eat or drink before a spike runs you through, which adds a certain twist to the whole thing. Grilled cauliflower at Hearth, New York Jasmine and Melissa HemsleyCookery writers In September we went to Hearth in New York. They offered us a seat at the chef\u2019s pass (directly in front of the kitchen), where we enjoyed the most incredible six-course tasting menu right at the heart of all the action. The atmosphere was electric, the food was incredible \u2013 the grilled cauliflower with sunflower seeds and capers, and grilled beef neck were especially memorable \u2013 and typical of chef Marco Canora\u2019s food philosophy. His rustic, home-style cooking champions seasonal produce, nose-to-tail eating and a \u201cwaste not, want not\u201d attitude. Spaghettoni at Ristorante Lido 84, Lake Garda, Italy Andrea PetriniFood writer, founder of Gelinaz!     Spaghettoni at Ristorante Lido 84, Lake Garda, Italy. Illustration: Nick Shepherd    It\u2019s simple \u2013 almost provocatively simple. Spaghettoni [thick spaghetti], butter and beer yeast. When it comes to the table it\u2019s almost monochrome \u2013 between pure white and lightly brown-ish in colour. The title of the dish may be simple, but of course it\u2019s not just one butter, but a blend of three, and the beer has been spread out and cooked in the oven on a very gentle temperature until it solidifies. You have totally al dente spaghetti, the very savoury, milky presence of the butter, the suggestion of the crunchiness of the yeast that adds a dose of acidity, and a gently insinuating touch of caramelisation. It\u2019s immediately recognisable comfort food that also pushes the boundaries. It\u2019s an instant classic, something I fear the chef, Riccardo Camanini, will have on his shoulders for many years to come. You cannot add anything else, because you would destroy the balance, the subtle dialogue between these three major ingredients. And if you take something out, it falls apart. For me, that\u2019s the definition of a dish, or a piece of art. You eat it in three bites, but it stays with you for a really long time. Porra de naranja at Arte de Cozina, M\u00e1laga, Spain Samantha ClarkChef and co-owner, Moro, Morito, London We have a house near Granada and we decided to do a detour and fly into M\u00e1laga to try a restaurant, Arte de Cozina, that one of our chefs had told us about. The standout dishes were porra de naranja and kid\u2019s sweetbreads. Porras are the precursors to gazpachos but made with fewer ingredients \u2013 sometimes just bread or dried fava beans, garlic, olive oil and water. This one was scented with orange. The texture was smooth and creamy, the flavour subtle with orange, a fruity olive oil and perhaps a touch of vinegar. Topped with chopped almonds for crunch and salty jam\u00f3n to balance the sweetness, it was nectar. \u2018Adidas\u2019 nigiri at Sawada, Tokyo Enrique OlveraChef-patron, Pujol, Mexico City Sawada is a tiny two-Michelin-star sushi bar with only six chairs, where the owner, Koji Sawada, and his wife are the only ones taking care of every aspect of the entire omakase. It was a tuna fish nigiri, but a totally different cut, between the chutoro (belly area) and the otoro, with so much fat it actually melted in your mouth. It was named by Sawada as the three lines of fat form an \u201cAdidas\u201d appearance, like the three lines of the sport brand. The thing that inspired me the most was to see Sawada doing such an unusual thing but with so much respect for his culture. Innovating from tradition, applying a subtle change or improvement. You can still do new things that honour your roots. Bonnat Madagascar chocolate bar David WilliamsThe Observer wine writer As someone with expensive tastes in wine and whisky (professional hazard) and cheese (just plain greed), I\u2019ve been wary of developing an addiction to posh \u2018bean to bar\u2019 chocolate. The chocolate penny finally dropped with a bar made by French artisans Bonnat from beans sourced in Madagascar. A light, fruity, elegant creamy style described as \u201cthe pinot noir\u201d of chocolate, it had me using words I\u2019d usually reserve for wine: balance, texture, and most of all, length (the taste lasted for minutes). Buttermilk chicken at the Clove Club, London Thomasina MiersWahaca founder, cookery writer For my mother\u2019s birthday at the end of January we took her to the Clove Club. They blew us away with the food. We had the buttermilk chicken, consomm\u00e9 and 100-year-old madeira, and an Orkney scallop and orange dish that was so light. It\u2019s exceptional how much they make from scratch: the charcuterie, the butter, the bread \u2026 My mother was blown away. Her eyes were shining like a seven-year-old\u2019s at Christmas. Jam\u00f3n from Barcelona Angela HartnettChef-patron, Murano, Cafe Murano I bought a jam\u00f3n from Joan La Llar del Pernil, brought it back to London and had a jam\u00f3n party in my garden. I invited Nieves [Barrag\u00e1n] and Jos\u00e9 [Pizarro] over, and some of my chefs; I thought I\u2019d get everyone round at 2pm and they\u2019d be gone by 8pm, but, of course, everyone was there until two in the morning. We\u2019ve since gone back to Barcelona and bought another jam\u00f3n.  Squat lobster from the Firth of Clyde Ben ReadeCo-founder, Edinburgh Food Studio, Edinburgh The most delicious thing I ate this year was a surprise gift of squat lobsters from a fisherman on the Firth of the Clyde called Ian Wightman. I\u2019d ordered a load of langoustines [for a festival I was cooking at in North Ayrshire] and he gave us these as a bonus. We cooked them up the top of a glen over an oak fire, with white wine, butter and some nutmeg. They are one of the sweetest, most delicious meats ever, but not many people use them \u2013 in fact, most fishermen throw them back because they\u2019re so small and they have horrible shells that cut into your fingers when you\u2019re opening them. But they\u2019re really worth the hassle, and the less you do when you\u2019re cooking them the better.

One man was jailed this year for 30 years for insulting the monarchy on Facebook. It is not clear if the uptick in cases comes from the palace or the government, which has cracked down on dissidents by detaining academics, journalists and politicians for \u201cattitude adjustment\u201d, a programme the junta uses to interrogate opponents. Thanakorn was also charged with sedition last week for sharing on Facebook allegations of corruption in the military\u2019s construction of a park monument. He was held incommunicado until Monday. While the junta uses l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 against critics, many Thais look back to a time where the king himself encouraged dissent, including during his 2005 birthday speech when he said he should be criticised as he is human.

Like the hundreds of thousands of his fellow Cambodians who migrate in search of work each year, he had a simple but powerful motivation: \u201cI heard there were better jobs in Thailand and I knew bahts were worth more than riels, so I decided to go.\u201d It was a decision that nearly cost him his life. After chatting with others in his village who had made the journey before him, San waited at the border for two days. When night fell on the second day, he crossed the border into Thailand and then waited another day on the other side. Eventually, a group of men appeared in a large pick-up.   Related: Shrimp sold by global supermarkets is peeled by slave labourers in Thailand    \u201cThey used their mobile phones as torches to see which of us looked strong, then they laid us next to each other and on top of each other in the back of the pick-up,\u201d says San. \u201cThere were three layers of us, with the strongest at the bottom. There were about 20 of us in the back and they put a plastic sheet over us and told us not to make any noise.\u201d Eight suffocating hours later, the pick-up stopped in a forest and San and five other Cambodians were herded into a cage and \u201clocked in so that the police wouldn\u2019t find us\u201d. Behind bars in an unknown forest in a strange land, the negotiations began. San and the others were offered $200 (\u00a3132) a month \u2013 far more than they would make at home \u2013 to work on construction sites in Bangkok.  They accepted, only to discover that they would have to pay their captors-cum-employers $80 for transporting them to the Thai capital, $80 for the correct documents, and $30 a month for basics such as mosquito nets. After working on the site for a month and realising they would never get the salary they had been promised, San and the others ran away \u2013 and promptly got lost in the city. \u201cI asked a Thai taxi driver to take me back to Cambodia,\u201d says San. \u201cI gave him $12 but he drove off without me.\u201d Desperate and exhausted, San headed into a police station. If he could get himself arrested as an illegal immigrant, he reasoned, they might just deport him home.  But, not for the first time, things weren\u2019t quite what they seemed. The policemen were, in reality, security guards, who turned San and a friend over to a man who said he could help them earn enough money to get back to Cambodia. They spent two days in a strange house before being loaded into a container, which was loaded on to a truck for what San thinks was a 15-hour journey. When the container was opened, they found themselves on a fishing boat at sea. \u201cI worked on the boat for about a month, pulling in the nets and collecting the fish,\u201d he says.  \u201cFor the first two weeks, I still had some energy but then it faded as I was only sleeping for one hour a day. When we got tired, they gave us a powder to dissolve in water and drink. I threw it away the first time they gave it to me and the second time, but when they saw I hadn\u2019t taken it the third time, they beat me. I knew if I didn\u2019t take the powder, they\u2019d kill me. I don\u2019t know what it was, but when I took it, my energy came back and I didn\u2019t need to eat any rice.\u201d     Seuy San, 40, a construction worker who was enslaved on a Thai fishing boat. Photograph: George Nickels/European Journalism Centre    The food and the drugs \u2013 probably amphetamines \u2013 weren\u2019t enough to sustain all those on board. One day, the crew lost patience with a Laotian man who was too ill to work. \u201cThey threw him overboard as an example to the rest of us. I was there for a month and I thought I\u2019d die there. They said all the Cambodians on the boat would die.\u201d Had the boat\u2019s cook not taken pity on the Cambodians and helped them to escape when the boat next put into port, San is sure that he and his friend would have met a similar fate to the Laotian.  Their luck held: after running off the boat and hiding in the bush, the pair eventually stumbled across some genuine Thai policemen who were kind enough to deport them.   Related: Nestl\u00e9 admits to forced labour in its seafood supply chain in Thailand    While San\u2019s experiences were extreme, they are not unheard of among the legions of Cambodians who head to Thailand in search of work each year. Estimates vary, but the total number of annual migrants is put anywhere between 660,000 and 1 million. Without the right documents, the migrant workers are easy targets for sexual exploitation, forced labour and modern-day slavery. They are also subject to political upheavals: in June last year, 220,000 labourers fled Thailand amid fears of a crackdown on illegal labour by the military junta. Migration is common in San\u2019s district, which lies about an hour from the city of Siem Reap in north-western Cambodia. So common, in fact, that he and two dozen others have gathered in the brightly decorated hall of a local temple to share their stories of trafficking and migration. The self-help group is part of a safer migration programme run by the Italian NGO Gruppo di Volontariato Civile (GVC). The participants, who sit on mats close to a jumble of golden Buddha statues, offer the same reasons for leaving: there\u2019s not enough work to enable them to support their families and even when there is, it\u2019s seasonal and the wages are too low.  The men and women take turns to share their experiences and offer advice or just a sympathetic ear. Many, like San, had found themselves denied the salaries they were promised; others had fled the police and gone into hiding. One man said he had been cheated into handing over $200 for a fake passport in Phnom Penh; a woman had been fined 500 baht (\u00a39.22) a day for being in the country illegally. Stefania Pirani, who heads the Migra-Safe project for GVC, says the aim of the programme is not to discourage migration, but to educate people about the dangers they could face. \u201cPeople really lack basic information: they live in remote areas and all they know is that there\u2019s work in Thailand,\u201d she says. \u201cThe decision to go is made in a couple of hours and when people run out of money, they just get in a taxi and go over the border. They don\u2019t know what a passport is or what it looks like.\u201d As well as facilitating the self-help groups, the project also informs people about how to begin the long, expensive and complicated process of getting a passport, and provides them with information and hotline numbers for the Cambodian embassy in Thailand. Pirani says that while the regularisation efforts from both the Thai and Cambodian governments have helped to reduce the dangers facing migrants, far more still needs to be done to make migration simpler, cheaper and safer. Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand need not only a passport, but a work permit visa, an overseas Cambodian worker card and an employment contract.  Although the Cambodian government launched a package in June that offered migrant workers all the necessary documentation \u2013 plus transport to the border and food \u2013 for $49, the true cost of working legally over the border remains far higher. \u201cAs we know from the villagers, it has been very difficult to get a passport at this price due to the lack of clear and comprehensive information and corruption,\u201d says Pirani. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to estimate the total cost of the process, but we can say that it can go from $200 up to $500 \u2013 and can take from four to six months.\u201d The average annual income in Cambodia is around $1,000 (\u00a3665). Given the cost, the delay and the need to apply in the capital, Phnom Penh, she adds, most Cambodians are still choosing to cross the border without the correct legal documents. The Migra-Safe project, which has run for two years and reached around 40,000 people, can only do so much. \u201cIf the procedures become easier and cheaper and there\u2019s also the possibility of obtaining documents at a provincial level, the majority of migrants will become regular,\u201d says Pirani. \u201cThe Cambodian government also needs to enforce the laws that already exist to combat human trafficking and labour exploitation, and to respect UN conventions and action plans that have been prepared together with international organisations.  \u201cMost of the time, some of the good initiatives and laws are only on paper and not enforced.\u201d She points out that both Cambodia and Thailand have much to gain from making migration as safe and easy as possible. \u201cThere are, of course, positive effects for the economy of Thailand, a country that needs a labour force from its poorer, neighbouring countries,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the medium- to long-term, there could be also great benefits for the Cambodian economy if there are instruments and policies in place to reintegrate those skilled workers in the country.\u201d Until then \u2013 regularly or irregularly \u2013 most of the participants in the self-help group are planning to return to work in Thailand. They have little choice. However, Seuy San will not be among them: \u201cI would never go back to Thailand, even if I had the right legal documents.\u201d", "publicationDate": "2015-12-16T07:00:10Z", "tags": ["Migration and development", "Employment", "Global development", "Human trafficking", "Cambodia", "Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/dec/16/enslaved-on-thai-fishing-boat-thought-i-would-die-there", "title": "Trafficked into slavery on a Thai fishing boat: 'I thought I\u2019d die there'", "sentences": ["San and the others were offered $200 (\u00a3132) a month \u2013 far more than they would make at home \u2013 to work on construction sites in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "In a museum on the outskirts of Bangkok, Thailand\u2019s famed sex industry is proudly celebrated.

Related: As sex workers we welcome Amnesty's policy \u2013 it will help empower us | Kay Thi Win    Presenting the sex trade without judgment and as equal to all others is highly contentious, especially for those who believe sex work is always an exploitative and desperate way to earn a living. Apisuk, an irreverent fellow of Harvard Law School who wears round tortoiseshell glasses, believes otherwise. She is pushing to decriminalise the trade so that sex workers can have equal rights. \u201cIt\u2019s normal work,\u201d she says. \u201cSex workers are not victims.\u201d Text on the wall describes how the Thai sex trade was boosted during the Vietnam war, when roughly 700,000 American soldiers spent their allotted rest and recuperation weeks in the brothels of Thailand.  \u201cOnce again sex workers adapted to the new customers, learning about exchange rates, rock\u2019n\u2019roll, [the] meaning of army ranks, slang and providing services to young American men, some traumatised by the war, in a rush to enjoy their week before going back to the war,\u201d the sign reads. \u201cUp until its end in 1975, the Vietnam war and by extension the sex workers of Thailand were responsible for injecting some $16m-$20m [\u00a310.6-\u00a313.3m] into the Thai economy annually,\u201d it continues. The first exhibit in the museum has a painting on the wall of a 400-year-old Chinese trade ship in Thailand. Wooden buckets of rice sit in front of it, the payment used for sex by sailors. \u201cSex work was legal back then,\u201d Apisuk says. \u201cSex would cost 15 kilos of rice. That much rice costs roughly 1,050 baht [\u00a320] today. So the price hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d In August, Amnesty International approved a policy to endorse the \u201cfull decriminalisation of all aspects of consensual sex work\u201d, shocking many women\u2019s rights campaigners. Before it was approved, the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (CATW) warned: \u201cAmnesty\u2019s reputation in upholding human rights for every individual would be severely and irreparably tarnished if it adopts a policy that sides with buyers of sex, pimps and other exploiters rather than with the exploited.\u201d The CATW campaign was supported by many former workers in the sex trade and given a boost by a host of Hollywood stars, including the Oscar-winning actors Meryl Streep, Kate Winslet and Emma Thompson. Amnesty argued that its research suggested decriminalisation was the best way to defend the rights of sex workers and will now use its weight to lobby governments to accept its point of view. It said sex workers are forced to live outside the law, making them vulnerable to aggressive police tactics, and leaving them unable to protect their rights against those who exploit them as they are threatened with criminalisation. Empower also believes criminalisation harms sex workers. \u201cIt will remove the stigma,\u201d says Apisuk, of Amnesty\u2019s policy change. \u201c[Sex workers] want to have rights. The right to be a citizen, to go to school, health schemes,\u201d she said, adding that sex workers are excluded from labour laws. \u201cIf you want a credit card, you have to define your work.

Sex workers need to know about marketing. It\u2019s a skill.\u201d An estimated 250,000 people in Thailand work in the sex industry, accounting for about $6.4bn in annual revenue, according to Havocscope, a database of information on world black markets. The 14 full-time staff at Empower work on HIV and Aids awareness campaigns and also help migrant women who travel to Thailand and work in the sex trade. Apisuk has little time for other charities focused on ending human trafficking, which she says punishes the female migrants seeking a better life.

After seeing how much comfort they gave them she started making gifts for children caught up in hurricanes, conflicts and other disasters around the world. Now, she is doing the same for refugee children.  \u201cI think there\u2019s something about a cuddly toy which is very reminiscent of a time when you were safe as a little one\u201d, said Marion, a volunteer for the British Red Cross, one of six charities chosen as beneficiaries of the Guardian and Observer\u2019s refugee appeal. A consultant in psychological trauma management, Marion has written a book based on her experiences in treating people who have suffered so much. So far, she has helped send thousands of teddies around the world. When the last plane landed in her home town of Belfast, she had a box containing 30 hand-knitted toys ready. Small enough to be held snugly in a child\u2019s hand, knitted in colourful wool with smiles and eyes stitched on, her toys are included in the Red Cross aid boxes given to new arrivals, and are often the first belongings a refugee child will own. \u201cWhen I speak about my trauma teddies to organisations I tell people: when you\u2019re knitting them, please think of the children who will touch the teddy and send your love to the child,\u201d she said in a phone call from her home.  During her visits to churches, residential homes and local community groups, she has told friends the story of the teddies and what they can do to help comfort refugees fleeing crises. The Red Cross wrote a note to Marion to tell her what a difference her teddies had made, particularly for child refugees who arrived in Northern Ireland to be resettled in the UK. The note read:   In terms of the trauma teddies, they\u2019ve made a massive contribution. The kids clung to them for all they were worth. There was no signs throughout the week of them having brought their own toys with them. So probably it was the first thing that was theirs. This is what they owned now. We had a number of group toys but the trauma teddies stayed indoors in their beds.  Marion said the significance of the toys was that they were universal. Red Cross aid workers told her that the first word of Arabic the children taught them was daab duub (\u062f\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f\u0648\u0628) or teddy bear, when they received their gifts. \u201cIt\u2019s great for breaking down barriers. And I thought that was just perfect.\u201d    Red Cross &#39;Trauma Teddies&#39;, lovingly handknitted, ready to give #BelfastWelcome to Syrian kids  @BritishRedCross pic.twitter.com/HLHoYji6di&mdash; Red Cross NI (@RedCrossNI) December 14, 2015    Jessica, a volunteer with the International Committee of the Red Cross who helped with translation when the refugees arrived in Belfast, described the scene as a plane touched down in Belfast. She said one lady was clutching a crying newborn baby, swaddled in a thick blanket with only a head of thick black hair visible.  \u201cIt\u2019s cold,\u201d said one woman pulling a flimsy coat around her. \u201cBut it\u2019s colder in Lebanon,\u201d said another man. Once they got through immigration, the group waited in the baggage area for the buses. People were tired and subdued. Huddled in families, parents kept an eye on weary children as Red Cross staff handed out drinks and snacks. Tayto crisps, a Northern Ireland favourite, are a big hit with the younger children, who break into smiles, wrote Jessica. \u201cWhere are we going? Where are our bags? Where is the bus?\u201d parents asked anxiously.   Related: The message from our appeal is clear: we stand with the refugees    Jessica and Marion are just two of the volunteers helping the Red Cross and is providing thousands of refugees and asylum seekers with support ranging from food and clothing to English lessons and guidance as people rebuild their lives. \u201cAnywhere I know children involved I try to send off a box of these teddies. So they go all over the world,\u201d she said. \u201cI had these ones here ready to go and when I heard about refugees coming I thought this would be super for the refugees, as they won\u2019t have much of their own.\u201d This small gesture began for Marion when she was in Australia, where a firefighter involved in bushfire rescue operations showed her a knitted teddy bear kept in his vehicle to give to children who are suddenly forced to flee their homes. Her career in caring for traumatised people started when she moved to an inter-faith area of Belfast, where she witnessed riots and civil disturbances on the streets and visited the families of people who had been killed and injured. Later, she spent time in the US when Vietnam veterans were coming back home. It was before post-traumatic stress disorder was recognised, she said. The Red Cross asked her to help train and consult at a trauma hospital in Bangkok after the Indian Ocean tsunami in December 2004. \u201cWe sometimes forget the volunteers, but they get so much precious experience in touching people who are traumatised. I know from a psychological point of view how important that is,\u201d she said.    Readers wishing to make a donation to the refugee appeal can give online here or by calling 0151 284 1126.

The brutality of their deaths on a sleepy and picturesque beach on Koh Tao island in September 2014 shocked the UK and Thailand, and made headlines across the world. But the subsequent Thai murder investigation \u2013 one of the first tests for a military junta that took power in a coup last year \u2013 drew even greater international attention, amid allegations of multiple police failings and calls for justice for the two Burmese migrants whose guilt was implied many months before their trial even started.  \u201cThis is one of the highest-profile consular cases we have in the world right now,\u201d a British embassy spokesman told the Guardian before the verdicts were delivered on Thursday, when the two men were found guilty and sentenced to death. Many people speculate that the killer still walks free. Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk, and Miller, 24, from Jersey, were found by the rocks on the smooth sands of the Sairee beach in September 2014, both with severe head wounds.     Murdered Britons Hannah Witheridge and David Miller. Photograph: PA    Within days of the killings, Thailand\u2019s freshly empowered junta was tripping over itself. Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha, who installed himself as prime minister, appeared to blame the victims, stating that tourists \u201cthink our country is beautiful and is safe so they can do whatever they want. But I ask: will they survive in Thailand if they dress in bikinis? [Only if] they are not beautiful.\u201d And when he later apologised for this remark, he made a second blunder, implying that foreign migrant workers, of which there are about 3,000 in Koh Tao, were guilty. \u201cWe have to help take care of [our nation] and not let not-good people mingle with us, such as unregistered alien workers. We can\u2019t let them work like that. It\u2019s dangerous and it can cause damage to the country,\u201d he said. Soon after, the two young Burmese men were arrested. Close to 3 million Burmese live in Thailand. They commonly experience low pay and poor conditions, and rights groups say it is not unknown for police to blame them for crimes. Police extracted confessions from bar workers Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo, both now 22, who were then paraded on Sairee beach to re-enact the murders in front of the media \u2013 a common practice in Thai investigations that is condemned as suggesting the suspect\u2019s criminality. Police said the pair were motivated by sexual jealousy after seeing the Britons together on the beach. But the case swiftly unravelled. The two later said they had been tortured during interrogation and forced to sign a confession. The families of Miller and Witheridge ultimately backed the Thai police after a Metropolitan police review of the investigation, adding that the \u201csuspects have a difficult case to answer\u201d. But when the trial started in July, more inconsistencies were gradually revealed by the defence, a team of Thai human rights lawyers and a British labour rights activist called Andy Hall. Wai Phyo told the court during the last two days of witness testimony in October that a police officer took photos of him naked. \u201cThey also kicked me in the back, punched me and slapped me; threatened to chop off my arms and legs, and throw my body into the sea to feed the fish. They also said they would take me into another room and electrocute me. \u201cPolice told me that as I had no passport, I had no rights,\u201d he said, adding that his interrogators said Burmese migrants had been killed before for not cooperating. The case against the men rests heavily on sperm collected from the crime scene, samples they say were taken from Witheridge\u2019s body. But when the defence asked for an independent retest, police failed to retrieve the samples and one officer suggested they had been destroyed.     Thai forensic investigators inspect a hotel room where one of two murdered British backpackers stayed on Koh Tao. Photograph: STR/AFP/Getty Images    The police case was further damaged when the head of the Thai forensics institute, Porntip Rojanasunand, told judges DNA on a garden hoe found bloodied near the deceased did not match that of the defendants. Thai police deny any wrongdoing. In a message passed to the Guardian through a member of the defence days before the verdict, the defendants said they were confident in the justice process. \u201cWe were not involved, we don\u2019t know how they can try and match us to these crimes, but we had nothing to do with what happened, we too are confused how they can try and link us to this crime,\u201d they said.    That the two Burmese suspects were made scapegoats so quickly was just one part of an omnishambolic police investigation  Thai blogger Saksith Saiyasombut     Human rights groups, including Amnesty International, have become involved in the trial and warned about potential miscarriages of justice.  \u201cThe fact that the two Burmese suspects have been made scapegoats that quickly was just one part of an omnishambolic police investigation that doesn\u2019t warrant any trust or faith in the whole case,\u201d the Thai political blogger Saksith Saiyasombut said. \u201cIt also hints at a general attitude by many Thais towards foreigners from neighbouring countries \u2013 mostly guest workers \u2013 as something lower than themselves.\u201d The two men, who appeared in court wearing thick shackles on their wrists and ankles, have also drawn the sympathy of a group of British nationals living on Koh Samui who would visit them in jail every week to bring food and company.     One of the beaches on Koh Tao, Thailand. Photograph: Chris Fredriksson/Alamy    Family-run islands An alternative narrative to the one offered by the police \u2013 and which is popular among residents of Koh Tao and Koh Samui \u2013 is that the assailant was linked to powerful families on the islands. Many Britons live on Koh Samui, the largest and most developed island in the archipelago, where the trial has been held in a fortress-like court surrounded by palms. They say privately that it becomes apparent fairly quickly that the islands are run by mafia-type families. Koh Tao, much smaller than Koh Samui, is known as a laid-back diving spot and still hosts infamously drug-fuelled full moon parties. Cocaine and crystal meth \u2013 known here as \u201ccrazy drug\u201d \u2013 are easy to find and their trade is controlled by families on the island, locals say. These families are powerful enough to make deals with the local authorities, residents say, and are also seen as a a longstanding stabilising force on the tropical islands far from the central government in Bangkok. \u201cIn some places the police and organised crime are uncomfortably close together. So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if certain directions in the investigations are either not being investigated or even outright dismissed,\u201d Saksith said. Few Thai media organisations reported from the court for much of the trial. One translator employed by Sky News said she was \u201cwarned off\u201d helping journalists by the Thai \u201cmafia\u201d after working for them for one day.", "publicationDate": "2015-12-24T03:55:03Z", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "UK news", "Jersey", "Channel Islands", "Europe"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/24/british-backpacker-case-thailand-on-trial-hannah-witheridge-david-miller", "title": "British backpacker murder case that put Thailand on trial", "sentences": ["These families are powerful enough to make deals with the local authorities, residents say, and are also seen as a a longstanding stabilising force on the tropical islands far from the central government in Bangkok."]}, {"article": "It\u2019s a funny time of year, the gap between Christmas and the new year. In many parts of the world, things stutter, shutter and slow. The pace of news can feel less frantic. It\u2019s as if the world itself is taking a moment for quiet reflection before annual renewal. Still, there\u2019s a newspaper to produce! And it can be challenging at this time of year to find a front-page lead. So I was pleased to see a piece penned by tech-savvy journalist Charles Arthur about the robot revolution. Did paranoia and panic about AI peak in 2015? And, if so, what\u2019s next as technology and artificial intelligence reframe the legal and ethical debates in this realm? Arthur\u2019s well-informed article sits comfortably on the front page as we hurtle through a decade of change. There\u2019s lots of coverage in this edition from Asia, where the Christmas break takes less of a toll. From Tokyo, there was quite surprising news that Japan and South Korea have reconciled over the issue of second world war sex slaves. Long a stumbling block to improved relations, an apology by the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is meant to acknowledge and compensate, and allow both nations to move on. Japan also passed its biggest-ever defence budget, with an eye on China. We bring you both stories. In Taiwan, voters are preparing for an election this month. We meet the heavy metal rocker who wants a seat in parliament. From Bangkok, meanwhile, the military junta releases a public opinion poll that shows some 99% of Thais are happy with its rule. So, all good then! In Europe, an election in Spain yielded a stalemate. We consider the implications in full in our Comment section. In Poland, the government faced criticism after the president enacted constitutional measures described by many as authoritarian. From the Middle East, Iran offered to \u201cjoin hands\u201d with the west in the fight against Islamic State, and western interests focused, yet again, on Helmand province in Afghanistan, where the Taliban is showing renewed strength. From North America, we return to our series on America\u2019s poorest towns (having taken a break from this in our expanded 18 December edition). Our third instalment visits the Texas border townships where the American dream seems nothing but a fantasy. In Britain, flooding in the north has dominated the news as the rain just keeps on coming. We look at the impact. We also take in thoughts on the UK economy for the months ahead. The Comment pages consider conspiracy theories, kitchen gadgets, libraries and the power of print. And your contributions on the Reply page challenge and question, as always, on subjects as varied as the US elections and relationship therapy. We\u2019re always happy to receive your letters for publication, which you can email to us by clicking here. The deeper-read Review takes a look at the Louvre, reimagined in Abu Dhabi. We profile the finance minister of Greece, who is a quiet architect of the hard road ahead. And we consider the impact of a weak Canadian currency on the winter flight to the US of that country\u2019s snowbirds, a term for the folks seeking to escape a (usually) frozen north. Books, culture and diversions round out the offering, touching on Shakespeare, colonial art and the sound made by falling rain, from patter to drumbeat to fizz (don\u2019t you just love Nature watch?).

Celebrities and business leaders joined NGOs to launch the global Action/2015 campaign, with events held in more than 50 countries. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan and Somalia contributed to the displacement of an estimated 5.5 million people in the first half of 2014, bringing the total number of people in the care of the UNHCR to 13 million, the highest number since 1996. By June, the UNHCR would report that the figures were the highest since the end of the second world war. January marked the fifth anniversary of the Haiti earthquake. Sam Jones reported on signs of recovery, but cholera was still present in the country, and there was growing frustration over the president\u2019s delay in calling elections.

Research by advocacy group Equality Now highlighted the number of countries that still have discriminatory laws, 20 years after an agreement to repeal them. And, in the countdown to the September deadline for the MDGs, we began a monthly look at each of the goals, starting with number one: halving poverty and hunger.

Many celebrated the passage of a bill that enshrined into law the UK\u2019s commitment to spend 0.7% of its GNI on aid each year. The law was mooted five years ago in the election manifestos of the three main political parties, but it took a private member\u2019s bill to see it through. This year\u2019s Commission on the Status of Women got off to a rocky start, with activists decrying the proposed text of the outcome document as bland and threatening a step backwards for women\u2019s rights. There was also disquiet over the publication of the final text at the start, rather than the end, of the two-week meeting in New York, following negotiations behind closed doors. To mark the fourth anniversary of the conflict in Syria, Sam Jones visited Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, where he met young refugees who had fled the fighting.

UN Women released its flagship report, the first since 2011, which focused on the barriers that prevent women from achieving their economic potential. The UN highlighted the rising death toll of civilians in Yemen since a Saudi-led coalition began airstrikes against Houthi rebels. The UN human rights chief attacked the Sun newspaper for publishing a column by Katie Hopkins that described migrants as cockroaches. Nepal was rocked by an earthquake on 25 April.

There was joy that an agreement had been signed, but reaction was mixed as no new money was provided.  A Guardian investigation uncovered how the Thai fishing industry is trafficking, imprisoning and enslaving Rohingya people on its ships. The UNHCR said the conflict in Syria had driven more than 4 million people \u2013 a sixth of the population \u2013 to neighbouring countries. The UN published its final report on the MDGs with a warning that, despite successes, results have been patchy across regions and within countries.

We revisited nine of the children in 2010 and this year we returned to eight of the countries to speak to the 10-year-olds and their families about their lives and the challenges they face. In the countdown to the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, we launched a series on life in the city. In Rio voices: Our Olympic odyssey we will hear regularly from those living in city, particularly the favelas. Michel Silva, Thais Cavalcante and Daiene Mendes will share their experiences until the Games begin in August. A year after Isis attacked the ancient city of Sinjar in northern Iraq, Yazidi families who escaped the violence spoke of their trauma after the siege and their desire to return home. We gained access to Sierra Leone\u2019s powerful secret societies, speaking to members who carry out female genital mutilation, and to a 16-year-old who is fighting back against the practice.

Singers Shakira and Angelique Kidjo, Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai and Pope Francis were in New York when the gavel went down on the 17 global goals \u2013 a moment met with cheers, applause and a great deal of relief. We live-blogged the UNGA debate, and our podcast debated how they will be promoted globally. To mark the adoption of the goals, photographer Nick Danziger showcased portraits of the women and girls in eight countries whom he followed over the past 10 years to see how the MDGs affected them. Filmmaker Nick Francis spent a day with Dhanlaxmi Devendra, a driver for Mumbai\u2019s all-female taxi firm.

MSF was joined by other NGOs in calling for an international investigation into the incident in Kunduz. To mark the International Day of the Girl, eight teenagers from around the world talked about the issues they face, from child marriage to the battle to stay in education, and their hopes for the future. Six months on from the Nepal earthquake, Sam Jones returned to Sindhupalchowk to report on efforts to protect children at risk of being trafficked from the disaster zone.  Three UN agencies warned of a concrete risk of famine in parts of South Sudan unless more aid reached affected areas and the country\u2019s leaders upheld a peace deal signed in August to end almost two years of fighting. We reported on the situation in Malakal, in the north, where children are paying the highest price in the conflict.

One Filipino fisherman, Raoul Rodriguez, who has worked on Irish prawn trawlers for several years, spoke of his experiences. Sierra Leone was officially declared Ebola free. Nadene Ghouri reported from Freetown on an education programme that is trying to get teenage mothers to return to school, following a spike in pregnancies among girls during the crisis. From Nepal, still reeling from April\u2019s earthquake, came warnings of a humanitarian crisis due to a fuel blockade at its borders with India. Mile-long queues for petrol formed in parts of Kathmandu.

But you might notice people with beer cans in brown paper bags, cocktails secreted in McDonald\u2019s cups and booze in hip flasks. As you can imagine, Times Square gets pretty busy. And touristy. Brooklyn is a good alternative. There are fireworks and live music at Grand Army plaza, at the north end of Prospect Park, from 11pm. But there\u2019s more to do than watch fireworks explode and balls drop. If, like me, you don\u2019t mind being a hipster stereotype, there\u2019s a number of warehouse parties around Brooklyn\u2019s Bushwick and Williamsburg areas.

In the hot and humid summer locals go to the beach, while those who stick in town gather with family and friends for a meat asado (barbecue) feast, with lots of sparkling cider, red wine, and Fernet (an aromatic bitter) with Coke. When midnight strikes, I make sure to find my way high on a rooftop for a festival of light. The Porte\u00f1o skyline illuminates with a colourful spectacle, and residents (dangerously) shoot fireworks from balconies and terraces. Shouts of \u201cFeliz A\u00f1o Nuevo\u201d and even f\u00fatbol chants ricochet off the concrete buildings.  Allie Lazar is a food writer based in Buenos Aires, she blogs at pickupthefork.com San Francisco      San Francisco brings in the new year with a literal bang thanks to an amazing fireworks display. A romantic view can be seen from Ina Coolbrith Park or you can take a boat ride on the bay. The citizens of SF get real flashy this time of year and anything sequined becomes the official fabric of the city. Swanky underground venue Doc\u2019s Lab kicks off 2016 with the North Beach Brass Band. One of my favourite neighbourhoods on NYE is the lively Mission District, which boasts some of the best food in the city and you can laugh your way into the new year with comedy legend Marga Gomez at Brava Theater. Gay nightlife is abundant in the Castro and South of Market neighbourhoods. Personally, I\u2019ll be ringing in the new year at the North Bay Cabaret. Wherever you end up on NYE make sure to get out the next day and enjoy the most important meal in SF: brunch.

While Thai New Year \u2013 held in April when the hot season really gets going \u2013 is our chance to mix merry-making and family with the occasional ferocious water fight, the beginning of a new calendar year is more about flocking to the banks of the Chao Phraya river to watch the fireworks, dance badly in public, and maybe have a tipple or two.

Photograph: Alamy    It\u2019s no surprise that in the land of the rising sun, the start of a new year is a significant event, but in Tokyo don\u2019t expect the massive parties and firework displays so prevalent in other major cities. Instead, there is a more introspective vibe and a homage to tradition, as most people spend the early evening eating buckwheat noodles at home with loved ones, before heading out to join the huge crowds for hatsumode (the first shrine or temple visit of the year) to pray for good fortune and buy lucky charms for the 12 months ahead. At Meiji shrine there is a festival atmosphere, with colourful food stalls and the din of distant ringing bells, as thousands of people patiently shuffle towards the shrine\u2019s inner sanctum from midnight onwards, with festivities (and trains) running until well after dawn. Alternatively, escape the city and hop on a train to Mount Takao (one hour from Tokyo station) to view the sunrise from a sacred mountaintop.Tom Fay is a journalist based in Japan Sydney      Sydney relishes its status as the first major city in the world to greet the new year (sorry, Auckland) and attempts to outdo itself annually with ever-bigger fireworks displays on the harbour.

For every family or couple that celebrates the evening alfresco, there is another that uses New Year\u2019s Eve as an excuse to stay in and cook a big meal, then watch the fireworks on the television.

Photograph: Kim Ludbrook/epa/Corbis    The city at the foot of Table Mountain takes advantage of its natural splendour to offer a range of new year celebrations. Locals choose between beach parties hosted by the likes of Pacha Ibiza, psychedelic trance gatherings, such as Rezonance, picnics on wine estates, fireworks at the V&amp;A Waterfront, and no end of themed events, comedy evenings, dinner-show cabarets and swish rooftop soirees. In practice, the typical Capetonian\u2019s mix of laid-back cool and fear of missing the big party \u2013 or wave \u2013 will render them unable to commit to buying tickets for these events. The typical NYE will start with a sunset picnic on Clifton Fourth Beach, a cable car ride up Table Mountain (last car down at 9pm) or a walk up Lion\u2019s Head. Then it\u2019s on to the bars of Long Street, where punters can pull their own pints and down unlimited beer until the bells at Beerhouse\u2019s Open Tap party. If local hipsters do make it to a venue, it will be an old favourite such as Yours Truly bar; most will more likely stagger between house parties in Woodstock, Obs and Mowbray. A tip for a memorable evening is a candlelit picnic in the Kirstenbosch National Botanic Garden, with live music by local sample-folk-meister Jeremy Loops; needless to say, tickets are still available.James Bainbridge is a travel writer and tour guide, myriadafrica.com Copenhagen     Fireworks show in Tivoli park.

A lot of Copenhageners imagine they will celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve attending a swanky ball with hundreds of interesting and attractive strangers. What most of us will actually be doing is attending a dinner with people we have known for ages spending hours debating whose party to crash later. Others will be gathering in thousands at midnight at the town hall square, armed with rockets, Roman candles and champagne, ready for the party to evolve. This may include hugging and snogging strangers in a state of champagne-induced bliss. What everyone will be doing on New Year\u2019s Day: tending to their hangovers while watching the new year\u2019s ski jump in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, on the television. What will I be doing on New Year\u2019s Eve? Celebrating with a small group of friends and their children. I find pyrotechnics and alcohol to be a tricky combination, so I will avoid the streets and enjoy the fireworks from the balcony. I\u2019m done slowly freezing to death while searching for a good party.

Nevsky Prospect is closed for traffic for one night and people go out to roam the streets. While celebrations in Moscow clubs and bars are known to be more glamorous \u2013 with longer queues, strict face control, and higher prices \u2013 St Petersburg, known as the bar capital of Russia for its artsy bohemian bashes, is more welcoming. Parties with lots of dancing take place at the Konyushennaya square bars and clubs such as Mosaique and Stackenschneider. Dumskaya street is another popular destination, with the karaoke bar Poison proving to be the most notorious, and hipsters and intelligentsia favour cafes and bars on Rubinshteina street.Sasha Raspopina is a journalist based in St Petersburg Gothenburg     Fireworks above the Gothenburg skyline.

From there, amid a huddle of revellers in thick jackets clutching bottles of beer and champagne, you\u2019ll get a great view of the fireworks that light up the sky and the dark waters of the G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv. Afterwards, head on down to either Andra L\u00e5nggatan or Avenyn to continue the party until the sun rises.

Photograph: Axel Schmies/Corbis    One can argue about almost everything else \u2026 but Berlin knows how to party. Almost one million Berliners (and tourists) take to the streets to enjoy the fireworks at Brandenburger Tor, the night\u2019s most crowded and popular spot, where you\u2019ll see people coming from all parts of the planet to rejoice together and drink beer and schnapps. For those who want to carry on the celebrations until morning, the city offers an abundance of club nights in popular venues such as Berghain, where the party runs straight through to Saturday evening. As with most permanent residents, however, I prefer to avoid the river of tourists, having a dinner at home with friends and later going to a rooftop to toast the new year above the city lights.Cesare Alemanni is editor of Berlin Quarterly London   01 Jan 2015, UK\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" />   New Year\u2019s Eve in London has its own ambience: that of blind-drunk survival. Every year the capital becomes an industrious end-of-days assault course, as costumed squads litter the streets and the tube turns into a 24-hour nightclub. Choice is another defining factor: parties are sardined into every restaurant, bar and pub back room, all vying to charge you \u00a320 to see their mate DJ. And thousands who \u201cjust want to have a chilled one\u201d jostle around the river for the annual fireworks display, only to lose everyone in the rush to the tube afterwards. Tiring of these scenarios, the professional partier knows that New Year\u2019s Day is the new New Year\u2019s Eve. While the rest of the city resembles those opening scenes of 24 Hours Later, these Londoners emerge fresh-faced to enjoy a dance in one of the many Berlin and Ibiza-channeling ravespots that pop up on 1 January. Me, I\u2019ll be escaping to Havana, but if I was London-bound I\u2019d no doubt be found seeing in 2016 here. After all, isn\u2019t celebrating better than just surviving?Kate Hutchinson is deputy editor of the Guide Rio de Janeiro     Crowds celebrate the new year at Copacabana Beach. Photograph: Alamy    In the thick of a crowd, in the light, sound and colour of a 16-minute fireworks extravaganza, Copacabana beach on New Year\u2019s Eve may sound like an unlikely place to find spiritual communion. But on the candle-lit sand and even on the avenue above the beach, a sense of stillness and joy prevails in the white-dressed throng. By the water, people will release flowers into the waves in honour of the goddess Iemanj\u00e1 \u2013 more than usual this year, perhaps, since according to the Afro-Brazilian religions Candombl\u00e9 and Umbanda, 2016 is ruled by Iemanj\u00e1 and Oxal\u00e1 (god of peace and creation). Also, this year, in honour of the Rio Olympics, the fireworks display will climax with a 2,000-drummer drumroll, as the sky turns bright white. Away from the beach, there are many fixed-price parties in places such as the Museu de Arte Moderna and Sociedade Germ\u00e2nia in G\u00e1vea, and more economical events at Rio\u2019s many hostels. But best of all is to get yourself invited to a house party, or tag along to one with your new best friends from the beach. Failing that, you can\u2019t go far wrong on the streets of the Lapa neighbourhood, where the year-round party crowd ramps it up one more notch.Claire Rigby is a journalist based in S\u00e3o Paulo Rome     Fireworks light up the sky above the Colosseum.

Although this year\u2019s official festivities remain in limbo thanks to empty public coffers, Romans will nevertheless take to the streets, bundled in parkas and clutching bottles of beer and wine to numb them to the relative cold. I spent most of 2015 in the crowded historical centre, so to ring in the new year, I\u2019ll be doing the opposite and going to a rooftop party on the Janiculum Hill overlooking Rome, prime position for an eyeful of the midnight fireworks displays. For similarly sweeping views, visitors can go to the Janiculum\u2019s Fontanone, a monumental fountain, for a impressive front row seats. Meanwhile, down in the centre, expect tipsy crowds with blow horns, firecrackers, and a healthy buzz to be partying well into the first morning of 2016.Katie Parla is a food and travel writer Mumbai     Waterfront at Marine Drive.

Home to people with diverse cultural and religious backgrounds, there\u2019s always reasons to celebrate. New Year\u2019s Eve is no different. This year there\u2019s governmental permission for restaurants and bars to stay open till 5am and foreign liquor retail shops can do business till 1am, as opposed to the previous deadline of 10.30pm. This means Deepak wines in Bandra, one of the most popular wines shops in the suburbs, will be raking in the money! My gang is planning on stocking up on alcohol and has booked suites at a hotel. We aren\u2019t very keen on going to a club, because all of us are on the sadder side of 25, and spending 3,000-4,000 rupees to go to a club full of strangers doesn\u2019t seem like such a good idea anymore. As for the more public celebrations, midnight at Marine Drive sea face in south Mumbai is a delightful sight.

It could be a really important technology to add to the portfolio.\u201d A filter that turns toxic water clean     Kids play in a polluted canal in central Bangkok. Photograph: Guillaume Payen/ZUMA Press/Corbis    A Texas teen, Perry Alagappan, won a water technology design prize in Sweden last August with a filter that he estimates would cost $20 to make. The filter, built with graphene nanotubes, could remove 99% of the heavy metals from water that runs through it. It could be particularly useful in cleaning up rivers contaminated with metals from electronic recycling factories that dotted Asia. The filter could be used again after a rinse with a vinegar concoction to remove the captured metals, which could then be sold to make products such as mobile phones. \u201cI became interested in water purification when I visited my grandparents in India, and saw with my own eyes how electronic waste severely contaminated the environment,\u201d Alagappan says.", "publicationDate": "2015-12-31T19:19:52Z", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Technology", "Technology"], "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/31/top-5-sustainable-technology-trends-of-2015", "title": "Top five sustainable technology trends of 2015", "sentences": ["It could be a really important technology to add to the portfolio.\u201d A filter that turns toxic water clean     Kids play in a polluted canal in central Bangkok."]}]}
